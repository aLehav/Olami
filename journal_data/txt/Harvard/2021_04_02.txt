After months of quarantine, the latest installment of Boston Ballet’s BB@yourhome, “The Art of Classical Ballet,” provides a program well suited to online viewing. The understated backdrops and staging allow the dancers’ strong technique and artistry to shine through. Of course, the experience is not quite the same as attending a ballet performance in person. The environment of the performance hall –– when physically present –– allows viewers to ride the surging emotions of the music together with other audience members and also brings another dimensionality to the performance itself, which a virtual program cannot emulate. Nevertheless, Boston Ballet compensates for this shortcoming by bringing many different styles to their production, highlighting their versatility even in the midst of a pandemic.
“The Art of Classical Ballet” consists of several different excerpts from different classical ballet pieces, including “Swan Lake,” “William Tell,” and “The Sleeping Beauty.” Although some acts are shakier than others, each piece in the production is presented with exceptional attention to detail and excellently showcases the artistic strengths of the dancers. The precise movements and rich emotion speak to the passion of the dancers. The subdivided layout of the program is also novel and refreshing, displaying a plethora of ballet styles within a single program. The diversity of pieces showcases the individual talent and diversity of the cast themselves, which includes several international members. In “La Esmeralda Pas de Deux,” principal ballerina Viktorina Kapitonova dances while synchronizing a tambourine to the beat of her movements and the piano. This feat, in addition to the many pirouettes and complex gestures, is precise and well-executed.
One criticism is about the dancers’ slight mistimings when synchronizing with the counts of the music. It is clear that the art of ballet is very difficult to perfect at such a high level; nevertheless, some timing and synchronicity issues do leave something to be desired. Moreover, some dancers seem a bit stiff during landings, which makes some excerpts seem mediocre. Most dancers, however, are truly exceptional and reach a level of mastery, truly outlining their talent. Particularly, the last “Swan Lake” excerpt, performed by principal dancers Lia Cirio and Paulo Arrais stands out: The fluidity of their movements and sentimentality, which can be felt through the monitor, embodies the highly refined and delicate nature of ballet.
Boston Ballet’s production of “The Art of Classical Ballet” is delightful to watch. Although the performance video does not showcase the orchestra or give the audience a physical sense being in the performance hall, it is a beautifully orchestrated program that many can appreciate. “The Art of Classical Ballet” is an enjoyable mini-performance perfect to be enjoyed at home in the midst of the pandemic. Whether you are looking to become informed in the fine arts or are a regular ballet viewer, online performances like this one are worth checking out until it becomes an option to see these productions in person once again.

In an unforeseen collaboration, Justin Bieber teamed up with Daniel Caesar and Giveon on the single “Peaches.” This star-studded track is dominated by Bieber, however, and as a result, the song falls flat.
The melody is a soothing blend of jazzy keyboard chords and low bass notes. That mellow vibe carries over into the soulful lyrics of Caesar’s verse, where the singer serenades listeners with extended high notes singing, “Hate to leave her, call it torture / Remember when I couldn’t hold her.” The beat relaxes to accommodate Caesar’s melancholy lyrics: “Days we save as souvenirs / There's no time, I wanna make more time,” giving focus to the soulful quality of the R&B singer. Similarly, that modulation occurs in the transition into Giveon’s verse, also highlighting the smooth timbre of his voice with the backing vocals. Giveon sings, “The one I need is right in my arms,” aiding the transition from upbeat flow into the hook with the addition of soulful ad libs that riff in the background.
In short, Caesar and Giveon’s verses work to enhance the overall sound and match the mellow vibe of the romantic lyrics. Conversely, “Peaches” suffers from Bieber’s contribution, and the song would have been better off without him.
The lyrics of Bieber’s opening verse, “I want to wrap my arms around you, baby / Never let you go,” blend perfectly with the sorrowful lyrics to come from the features. However, Bieber’s repetitive chorus is riddled with very shallow and surface level sentiments that contradict that deeper sentiment. “I get my weed from California” and the supporting ad lib, “That’s that shit,” do nothing to compliment the romantic lyrics, and seem misplaced in a song about love and loss.
Likewise, the chorus speeds up the tempo and takes the song away from the vocals of the two features. When Giveon holds his last note, for example, Bieber interferes with that flow and tunes him out, bringing the song out of its more complex harmonies and back into the reworked chorus. The chorus is not just disruptive to the features, it is also pervasive throughout the song, accounting for more than one third of the song’s total duration. As a result, the song ends up sounding very repetitive and formulaic, falling on the short end of mediocre.
Similarly underwhelming is Bieber’s failed attempt at curing social inequality with a couple of nationalistic lyrics.
Bieber released “Peaches” in anticipation of his sixth album, “Justice,” released March 19. Bieber stated that the album’s goal is to provide “healing — and justice — for humanity.” That message is lost in translation, however, since the song takes more of a summery-vibe approach rather than a political reformation one. Bieber’s attempts at alluding to icons like Martin Luther King by saying that he buys peaches in Georgia is more disrespectful than legitimate — especially considering that the simple cookie cutter formula of the insistent chorus was practically formulated to be an industry money grab.
In a series of repetitive choruses and out of context lines, Bieber ends up as the third wheel on his own song. Despite his ambitious goals for a torrent of change, the only positive impact the Canadian superstar can hope to achieve with “Peaches” is a ripple in the mainstream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was younger, I had a stutter. Words used to stumble through the gap in my front teeth, tripping over their own syllables and landing unceremoniously in the air in front of me. The most difficult sounds to pronounce were vowels: Sentences that began with a, e, i, o, u (and sometimes y) got lodged in the back of my throat and were exceptionally difficult to untangle. Struggling through a stutter weakened my delicately emerging ego, and although I was an extroverted child around family, in school, I was shy and silent.
However, there were always other ways to communicate. In my early elementary years, I substituted my vocal cords for chalky graphite and learned how to articulate my thoughts on paper. A decade later, my stutter has subsided, and writing is still my communication form of choice. But, even without my stutter, a fear of judgment persisted. And being at Harvard has only made it worse.
You see, at Harvard, there is a different form of verbal communication that taunts me. I call it Harvard Speak, a sophisticated language marked by familiar phrases that distinguish an academic. Harvard Speak can be used in two ways: to embellish or to elevate.
For example, say you find yourself in a class discussion about a book chapter that you have not read. Five minutes before lecture, you furiously skimmed the chapter’s key points, but you fear that will not provide enough protection against your teaching fellow’s skeptical eye. Worry not — you need only employ Harvard Speak to embellish your underdeveloped ideas. Fill your sentences with phrases like “very much so” and “insofar as” to convince the listener of your cleverness.
On their own, these expressions are empty, but when used correctly, they can make superfluous sentences sound mystifyingly lyrical. Clarity is obscured in the fog of never-ending clauses and, at some point, the distinction between nuanced and convoluted thought disappears. But your listener probably won’t notice — after all, the more words you say, the smarter you sound.
Harvard Speak may also be used to enrich already eloquent speech. In fact, articulate diction presupposes the use of Harvard Speak as a natural feature of its excellence. Captivating orators wield Harvard Speak; their intellect is enticing, and moreover, downright infectious. They have perfected the art of gently rowing the listener along the current of their speech, guiding them into a hypnotic enchantment that is difficult to break.
What I find most interesting about Harvard Speak is that it is a language not entirely reliant on meaning. Whether or not you fully understand what you are explaining is irrelevant: What matters is whether you are explaining it well.
Given this, there is one crucial aspect of Harvard Speak that I have neglected to mention: To use it, you must possess unmalleable confidence. Only one who is confident can properly flower language in such a bewitching manner. This is because while Harvard Speak consists mostly of decorative terms, it is the conviction behind these phrases that ignites them.
This conviction is what I, and others who feel nervous speaking in elite academic settings, unfortunately lack.
The ability to assert yourself in academic spaces is how one’s intelligence is ratified. At Harvard, impressing your teachers and peers with invaluable contributions to the classroom proves that your much-coveted spot at this institution was not in vain. But to the students who are quiet and nervous, we fret the invisible accusations of inferiority — and, in turn, doubt our own place as well.
Because Harvard Speak is a dialect that we were not taught as children. Many of us didn’t know how to speak to adults with a straightened spine, because many of us didn’t know that we could. Elders were to be respected. Children were to stay in a child’s place. Meekness was a virtue and a smart mouth was a vice.
Our polite demeanors (“yes sir, no ma’am”) protected us against a world that punished kids with too much confidence. But this demeanor stuck with us past childhood, stunting our abilities to be unapologetic and prideful. Who were we to think ourselves as anything more than small? Who were we to demand attention? Whether it be the fear of fitting racial stereotypes, the novel pressure of being the first in your family to attend college, or the familiar discomfort experienced by women in male-dominated spaces — society is prejudiced to believe that we are to be seen, and not heard.
The confidence that comes naturally to many of our peers — the noble assertiveness that many of us were taught to suppress — is an object of my envy. But I choose not to dwell on that envy; instead, I will act on it. I will become fluent in Harvard Speak, and transform what has long rusted into gold.
But, before I master Harvard Speak, I must master confidence. Come to the realization that I am no longer a powerless child with a slight stutter, but a Harvard student, and that leaves no time to be timid. If I am to make my way past class discussions into the unforgiving realm of academia, I must learn to speak up. I must learn how to swiftly interrupt others, how to command an audience, and how to monopolize the space I fill. Somehow, I must mimic the impressive behavior of those around me, without separating myself from the life that has shaped my entire being.
Once I’ve mastered that, then I’m truly Ivy-bred. Harvard Speak will flow seamlessly from my mouth, and I will transform into the articulate aristocrat that is expected of me. There is no point in resisting this metamorphosis — conformity is the unavoidable price of prestige, and I’m willing to pay it. I can only hope while seeking success, I do not lose myself borrowing someone else’s words. To my silent peers, I wish for you the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 2000, Harvard’s Office of Career Services banned McKinsey and Company from recruiting on campus for one year. This would be the only recruiting ban in this century of Harvard College’s history — at least no other records of recruiting bans exist in The Crimson archives since 1982. So what did McKinsey do to warrant this largely unprecedented action?
Was it on par with their plan to “turbocharge” opioid sales, which they settled this year for nearly $600 million and one commentator called the “corporate equivalent of manslaughter”? Or was it as bad as their recommendations to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement on how to best starve migrant detainees (which even some ICE personnel found too extreme to consider implementing)? Perhaps it was related to their advising authoritarian governments on how to crack down on dissidents? Could articles such as “How McKinsey Destroyed the Middle Class,” which was published in the Atlantic, have resulted in such a ban?
If you guessed McKinsey’s long history of socially destructive behavior was the reason Harvard banned them for a year, you’d be wrong. In reality, Harvard banned McKinsey for not recruiting on campus. Yes, you read that right.
In the fall of 1999, to Harvard’s dismay, McKinsey decided to break tradition and take its recruiting off campus. Their reason was Harvard simply didn’t have enough facilities for them to interview all of the students that were qualified. When McKinsey informed Harvard of their plans too late, the Office of Career Services was left with empty rooms and not enough time to find companies to fill them.
Given that Harvard has been willing to temporarily ban a company for creating a few empty rooms, Harvard should also be willing to temporarily ban companies for repeated, flagrant, and extraordinarily large-scale social harms.
It’s time for Harvard to ban McKinsey, again. There is a clear public record of 47 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, and five territories collectively suing McKinsey for turbocharging opioid sales, a massive resultant settlement, as well as numerous works of investigative journalism into McKinsey’s various other acts of malfeasance. Knowing this, Harvard should enforce a penalty, whether it be a one- or two-year ban on on-campus recruiting, or perhaps even longer.
Harvard facilitates access to top talent and, whether the University sees it this way or not, it is essentially endorsing groups by welcoming them to campus and facilitating warm introductions between employers and students.
The strongest censure of an unethical company is a ban, and the next step is greater access to information.
Harvard investigates other behaviors. For example, it has an Administrative Board and an Office of Gender Equity that lead investigations, make judgments, and enforce penalties. Harvard has clear expectations of students and faculty and has bodies to ensure these standards are met. Similarly, OCS expects companies to pay them $500 a semester and follow basic hiring rules such as not serving alcohol, not discriminating against or sexually harassing students, and not making exploding offers.
Essentially, Harvard protects its students while they are on campus yet has nothing to say when the companies that they invite to campus and introduce to students later abuse those students as graduates and deeply harm society.
Harvard needs a new body associated with OCS that compiles information about the social impact and workplace environment of every company that hires more than one student per year and that shares this dossier with students before they go into campus interviews.
Information worth compiling includes clear public records of wrongdoing, fines and settlements, works of investigative journalism, and reports of abuse by Harvard alumni and peers as well as what the company has to say about itself. Students could be hired through a work-study program to build this collection of knowledge alongside faculty and OCS staff. If the findings are sufficiently abhorrent, a committee would decide on an appropriate penalty.
More perfect information would protect Harvard students from workplace abuse and channel Harvard students’ talents towards work with less negative social outcomes and greater positive impact. For example, every student entering an interview with Goldman Sachs would know beforehand that a recent self-selected survey of first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found “workplace abuse.”
Students would know that on average those surveyed worked 105 hours in the last week and one respondent reports “consistent 9am-5am’s.” They’d also know that those surveyed saw their average self-reported mental health drop from 8.8 to 2.8 out of 10 and their physical health drop from 9.0 to 2.3 from before to after starting the job.
Regardless of the fact that they are making close to $100,000 a year or more through salaries and bonuses, the abusive treatment found in the survey is unacceptable. At the very least Harvard should inform students what they’re getting themselves into before actively introducing Goldman Sachs to them every year.
In the end, a ban will not prevent students from joining companies like McKinsey. And that’s not the point. In fact, in 2000, student interest was unaffected when McKinsey was banned from on-campus recruiting. Students that wish to join banned organizations need only walk to a local hotel to meet them. Nonetheless, bans matter. Bans say that Harvard cannot afford to be associated with such companies and cannot conscionably facilitate interactions between them and their students.
Ultimately, once companies know that the social harms and employee mistreatment they perpetuate will rapidly be shown to future recruits, they may think twice about business decisions that harm society and their employees. Standards need to be set and Harvard’s Office of Career Services should lead the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ghungroo, Harvard’s annual celebration of South Asian cultures, will be held entirely virtually this Saturday for the first time in its over 30 years of production.
The show, which is presented by the South Asian Association, is the University’s largest student-run production. This year, rather than filing into the Agassiz Theater, attendees will enjoy Ghungroo’s music, dancing, spoken word, visual art, and skits from their homes.
When this year’s Ghungroo directors started planning for the show last May, the possibility of an in-person performance was still up in the air.
“In the summer, we didn't know what was going to happen in the spring,” co-director Dhwani Bharvad ’22 said. “We just had to be more dynamic, so we had lots of backup plans and different ideas.”
As it became evident that it would be impossible to hold the event in person, the Ghungroo team shifted to a virtual format, holding rehearsals on Zoom throughout the winter and ultimately compiling hundreds of videos that performers filmed of themselves.
“Instead of walking to the Quadrangle to go have practice at the SOCH, you're instead logging into a Zoom call,” Ghungroo co-producer and SAA co-president Fariba Mahmud ’22 said. “Instead of having rehearsals and creating the set in the Agassiz Theater, instead you're making graphics online to incorporate into the video of the show.”
Arjun J. Prasad ’22, Ghungroo co-producer and SAA co-president, said that advertising for the event also changed. Students were no longer able to distribute tickets in dining halls or publicize in newsletters.
“However, we have been able to maintain our other pub methods — so house lists, club lists, email lists, word of mouth,” he said. “Personal reach out to family, friends.”
Choreographer and costume director Anika Bagaria ’24 said logistical challenges included mirroring dance movements on video or having more people on a call than could be shown on the screen at once.
Still, the primary challenge for Bagaria and the other over 70 members of the Ghungroo Tech and Production team was fostering a “vibrant” community online, she said.
“That's why people do Ghungroo, it's to have fun and just meet people. And so we found ways definitely to find that community, which is really great,” Bagaria said. “I'm happy it worked out, but that was definitely the biggest challenge.”
The theme of Ghungroo 2021 is #Connection. Ghungroo co-director and former Crimson Multimedia chair Ryan N. Gajarawala ’22 said he and the other directors chose the theme for a year which has “torn apart our lives” and scattered Harvard students across the globe.
“We've been able to unite and build a shared appreciation for South Asian cultures and that connection to not only South Asian cultures but also to each other,” Gajarawala said. “This experience has bonded a lot of people and brought a lot of joy, and I think that's the message we're trying to send.”
Aside from having to significantly adapt the production, the virtual setting has come with silver linings. The directors said one advantage was the opportunity to offer Ghungroo to a broader audience.
“There's always been a handful of alumni who have very strong ties to Ghungroo but can't make it because they live across the world, but this year the fact that people from literally anywhere in the world can join is super special,” co-director Anagha B. Kumar ’22 said.
Like in previous years, hundreds of students will perform in this year’s installment of the show. Mahmud called it a “testament to Ghungroo and the community” that the participation of dancers and musicians has remained strong despite the show’s virtual format.
“Students have really put so much joy and love into this year’s show, especially in a year that's been really tough to get participation in general,” she said.
Prasad said one memorable aspect of this year’s programming has been the involvement of freshmen, especially given they have never experienced Ghungroo in-person.
“Getting so much support and help from first-years has been, quite frankly, one of my favorite feats of the show,” Prasad said.
Bagaria, who is a freshman, said the production was “a huge reason” she was excited to attend Harvard. Though she was initially disappointed it would be held virtually, she nonetheless wanted to participate and help run the show.
“As a freshman, I always wanted to get involved, and I was like, ‘Alright, you know what, it's gonna be virtual, that's a fact. Let's try to make it the best that it can be,’” she said.
Gajarawala said he was “in awe” of the innovation and collaboration of the performers and the Ghungroo Tech and Production team for creating the virtual event entirely “from scratch.”
“The legacy of Ghungroo didn't die, even amid the pandemic,” Gajarawala said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Founders of the Black Visions Collective — a nonprofit based in Minnesota that advocates for Black empowerment — spoke about their local organizing work and the defund the police movement at a Harvard Kennedy School event Wednesday.
Moderated by Kennedy School criminal justice professor Sandra S. Smith and sociology professor Christopher Winship, the event was the latest in the ongoing “Reimaging Community Safety” speaker series, which the Kennedy School’s Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management launched in response to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police.
Wednesday’s virtual event brought Harvard professors in conversation with the organization’s co-founders: Oluchi Omeoga, Kandace Montgomery, and Miski Noor.
The Minnesota-based collective launched in late 2017 to bring attention to issues concerning the intersection of Black and BGLTQ people. The group, which is active in racial justice protests, has been part of lobbying efforts to defund the Minneapolis Police Department and divert its budget to other programs.
Omeoga said the collective is dedicated to advocating for Black people “most at the margins.”
“We actually have to center those most at the margins. It’s not rocket science to know that a Black woman both faces racism and sexism, and then we take a look at trans folks, that transphobia is also included as well. When we take a look at disabled folks, ableism is also included as well.”
Per Noor, policing in America is marred by racism and thus “irredeemable.” She said the original purpose of police in American history was to catch and return runaway enslaved people.
“The police — as a Black person, I know — have never really been here for me,” Montgomery added.
Achieving a “police-free future,” according to Montgomery, requires bold change at the legislative level. She said the collective has begun collecting signatures to change Minneapolis’s city charter, which she said prioritizes the local police department as the only required department within the city.
Instead, Montgomery said her organization believes Minneapolis should operate a “Department of Public Safety,” which would take “a holistic, public health-centered approach to safety in our community.”
In an interview after the event, Omeoga said she believes defunding the police is a way to prioritize safety and wellbeing.
“To defund — it’s not even just taking away something, it’s like, what are we putting in place of that, right? How are we investing in not just yourself but the people around you?” Omeoga said.
Montgomery acknowledged effective activism involves accepting that “we don’t have all of the answers.” To determine what safety looks like for the public, Montgomery suggested holding “people’s movement assemblies here to gather folks from all different types of communities to come together through political education.”
According to Noor, though the Minneapolis City Council diverted $1.1 million from the police’s budget in 2018 and $8 million in 2020, Minneapolis “continues to invest in police.”
“In order to prepare for the trial [of Derek Chauvin], they actually spent $35 million militarizing our city,” Noor said.
Once the media’s coverage of police in Minneapolis decreases, Noor said Black Visions Collective will continue to advocate for issues that affect Black people.
“When all the shiny stuff goes away, there are organizations who are really holding it down until that next big moment when we have to push things a little bit further again.”

William C. Hsiao, an Economics professor emeritus at the Harvard School of Public Health, spoke about the problems with America’s health system and the potential benefits of a single-payer system during a HSPH webinar on Thursday.
After being featured in a popular Chinese-language health systems series by the School of Public Health intended to provide public health expertise to Chinese academics and researchers, Hsiao decided to discuss the U.S. health system again in English.
Hsiao began the webinar by stating he thinks the American healthcare system is “broken.” In 2019, America spent $3.8 trillion — around 18 percent of its GDP — on healthcare, representing an expenditure 50 percent larger per capita than that of countries like Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Despite this, the U.S. has “the worst health outcomes among all these nations,” according to Hsiao.
Hsiao said gaps in the American healthcare system exist in terms of insurance coverage and the quality of healthcare available. Hsiao also said he thinks the system is inefficient due to concerns such as high administrative expenses, over-treatment, and fraud and abuse.
“We’re wasting 30 percent of our spending every year,” Hsiao said.
Hsiao added that he thinks historical measures to improve the system — such as Medicare and Medicaid, Obamacare, and now Biden’s proposal of a public option — are just temporary solutions.
“The United States, by my analysis, has a system that cannot be sustained,” Hsiao said. “We have been putting Band-Aids on a rotten structure, and eventually, it will collapse.”
Hsiao spoke extensively about whether the United States should adopt a single-payer, Medicare-For-All system. According to Hsiao, the proposed system would alleviate the stress of the uninsured or underinsured by guaranteeing coverage under the same benefit package.
Hsiao further claimed that reducing administrative expenses under one set of rules, stopping duplicate treatments with one essential benefits package, and minimizing abuse and fraud with consolidated claim records would save the U.S. money in the long term. Using one model, the U.S. would potentially save 30 percent — $1.1 trillion a year, based on 2019 figures — from a single-payer system.
However, in an interview with The Crimson, Hsiao said the greatest roadblock towards reform is politics.
“Economists have technical answers, analytical answers based on evidence — but the constraint, what’s possible, is determined by political forces,” Hsiao said.
A system that would eliminate the need for private insurers threatens the private medical insurance industry in the United States, which holds political power, Hsiao said. To address this, Hsiao suggested looking to Germany, whose hybrid healthcare system relies on both private and public insurers. Those who earn under a certain salary are required to enroll in the “statutory” public program, whereas those who are wealthier can decide to buy their own private health insurance.
“Germany found a way to give a role to the private health insurance companies but still improve the system significantly,” Hsiao said.
Senator Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign created a political movement centered on Medicare-For-All that has gathered momentum since, according to Hsiao.
“That first really became a political movement by Bernie Sanders in 2016, but that movement continued,” Hsiao said. “And this gathered momentum. That’s something new.”
Though Hsiao expressed frustration at the politicization of the U.S. healthcare system, he said he thinks “there is hope for the United States.”
Hsiao said he thinks people, burdened by the current system, will continue to push for healthcare reform, though some hospitals and insurers will fight back.
“People who have to pay find it very painful. The people who take the money say, ‘I’m doing fine.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 12, 2021 at 11:30 p.m.
The state of Texas filed an amicus brief Tuesday in favor of the anti-affirmative action group suing Harvard over its race-conscious admissions policies.
Students for Fair Admissions, which first filed suit against Harvard in 2014, petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court on Feb. 25 to review a pair of lower court rulings that decided in favor of Harvard’s use of race in admissions. In addition to reiterating its previous claims that Harvard’s admissions practices illegally discriminate against Asian American applicants, SFFA called on the justices to overturn Grutter v. Bollinger — a 2003 landmark case in which the Supreme Court deemed the use of race in higher education admissions constitutional.
In its filing, the Texas Attorney General’s Office put its support behind SFFA’s call for the Court to overturn Grutter.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a law professor at Stetson University, described the brief as a “full frontal assault on existing precedent.”
“They are seeking to overrule the Fisher cases – the two Fisher cases in the Supreme Court — and Grutter, Gratz,” Lake said, referring to Supreme Court cases that have upheld race-conscious admissions practices. “What that brief is aiming at is rewriting constitutional history, overruling a couple of cases that the court has said that they will stand on.”
Lake said a brief from Texas is “extremely powerful.”
“Texas has been a battleground over race-conscious admissions for decades,” Lake said. “The court’s gonna pay special attention to that.”
Texas was previously the setting for a contentious battle over affirmative action. In 2016, Abigail Fisher, a white woman who was denied acceptance to the University of Texas at Austin, sued the university for allegedly violating the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which eventually ruled in favor of the university and upheld the use of race in higher education admissions.
The amicus brief filed by the Office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton presents four main arguments against the 2003 Grutter case.
The brief states that the Grutter decision departs from longstanding Supreme Court rule that the Constitution outlaws racial discrimination; that Grutter cannot be applied consistently; that the court has violated the principles of Grutter; and that Grutter has not generated “reliance interests.”
The Texas Attorney General’s Office called the use of Grutter as precedent “state-imposed and state-funded race discrimination.”
In its ruling in Grutter, the Supreme Court held that the use of race in higher admissions is constitutional because it serves a “compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.”
In the brief, though, Texas argued that the Supreme Court has not explained why diversity is a compelling justification for racial discrimination in higher education but not in other contexts.
“Grutter never provided a principled reason for why diversity is sufficiently compelling in higher-education admissions but nowhere else,” the brief states. “Nothing about these claimed benefits is unique to collegiate lecture halls – yet this Court has never extended Grutter to other contexts.”
The brief argues that the only “constitutionally viable reason” to permit federally-funded programs’ use of race is “remedying past acts of de jure segregation.” In Grutter, though, the Court upheld race-conscious admissions practices due to the apparent educational benefits of a diverse student body.
“Protecting the best interest of a child is insufficient,” the brief alleges.
The Texas Attorney General’s Office also criticizes the University of Texas in the brief for using race in its admissions process.
Lisa R. Eskow ’87, a clinical professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, called it unusual that Texas’s Attorney General would file a petition condemning the admissions practices of a public university within his own state.
“It’s remarkable to see a state Attorney General spending most of a brief — that it had no obligation to file — criticizing the policies of a state university it is supposed to represent,” she wrote in an email.
Michael A. Olivas, professor emeritus at the University of Houston Law Center, called Texas’ filing of a brief “predictable” and “wasteful.”
“The state of Texas should be policing its own ranks, not worrying about what private schools in Massachusetts do,” Olivas said.
The Texas Attorney General’s Office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Thursday evening.
As of the deadline to file a brief in support of SFFA, Oklahoma did so in partnership with 13 other states.
Eskow wrote that she predicts other states and organizations will file briefs in favor of Harvard.
"If the Court grants the petition, I do expect to see states weighing in to support Harvard," she wrote.
After requesting a 45-day extension, Harvard has until May 17 to submit its response to SFFA’s brief.
CORRECTION: April 12, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated that Oklahoma was the only other state to file a brief in support of SFFA as of the deadline to file. In fact, Oklahoma did so in partnership with 13 other states.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have obtained a sample of over 100,000 baby teeth that they plan to use to determine indicators of individuals’ long-term health.
The teeth are left over from the “Baby Tooth Survey,” a study conducted in St. Louis in the 1960s to measure the amount of strontium 90, a radioactive element not found in nature, in children. Schoolchildren were encouraged to send in their teeth to the researchers to receive a collectible button.
The teeth were donated to the Harvard researchers by Joseph J. Mangano, the executive director of the Radiation and Public Health Project, a non-profit organization that investigates and communicates effects of low-level nuclear fallout on public health.
The original study found significant strontium 90 in many of the teeth samples collected, a result of the above-ground nuclear test conducted in the United States at the time. The findings ultimately led President John F. Kennedy ’40 to sign a treaty banning all types of above-ground nuclear tests.
Marc G. Weisskopf, a professor of environmental epidemiology and physiology at the School of Public Health, said he hopes to use the teeth to explore the impact of childhood environmental factors on the body as well as on long-term health.
Weisskopf and his team are trying to track down the original donors, who are now in their 60s and 70s. Weisskopf said that the teeth are able to give a “snapshot” of the participants’ childhood health. They plan to interview subjects about their current health.
Weisskopf said the teeth have been stored “literally just in shoe boxes in somebody’s garage,” so the first step for researchers was to catalogue all of the teeth.
Kaleigh A. McAlaine, a HSPH research assistant who worked on developing the survey for participants, said that the questions include those asked on established evaluations to ensure “validated results.”
She said that the survey takes about 30 minutes to complete and will be followed by an online cognitive test.
“The survey is really to get a background on lifetime health, so it's got a lot of questions in there. We're looking at people's health over their entire lifetime, and not just their physical health, but their mental health, their social health, their economic health,” McAlaine said.
Weisskopf added that his team is also trying to get extra samples, including blood and toenails samples, from a subset of participants, which could provide more information on their current health.
The team has been searching voter rolls to identify current mailing addresses and email addresses. They have already conducted a small pilot, the outreach for which garnered a “promising” 30 percent participation rate.
“That helped us to generate more funds, to say, ‘We can do this and we want to now scale up to the full cohort,’” Weisskopf said. “We have great hope. But we'll see the reality in the next few months.”
McAlaine said that the results of the study could help provide a better understanding of how the environment of a child impacts their health decades later.
“[The original study] was used by Kennedy to enact the above-ground nuclear test ban treaty. So it had huge ramifications,” McAlaine said. “And I think this could too if we get really positive results.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a data breach of the Harvard Business School’s secure file transfer system in December, experts said they foresee ongoing consequences for the system’s users.
The HBS breach occurred when a third party exploited the secure file transfer system Accellion File Transfer Application and downloaded students’ personal information. Other affected institutions using the system included the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Washington’s State Auditor Office, Canadian jet manufacturer Bombardier, and Jones Day Law Firm, which represented Donald J. Trump’s administration and reelection campaign.
On March 1, Accellion announced that it retained FireEye Mandiant, a cybersecurity forensics firm, to scour the FTA for vulnerabilities by performing penetration testing and reviewing code. Acellion also charged Mandiant with investigating the cyberattacks.
Isif Ibrahima, a threat analyst at Mandiant who worked on a report about the breach, said Mandiant tracked two groups involved with the stolen data: UNC2546 and UNC2582.
UNC2546 was responsible for the FTA exploitation and exfiltration, where hackers took advantage of a zero-day vulnerability in the device. Lauren Zabierek, a cybersecurity expert at the Kennedy School, described a zero-day vulnerability as a “hole.”
She added that because FTA is a 20-year-old legacy product nearing the end of its life, “these holes weren’t being patched.”
Accellion offers a migration service free of cost for clients to transfer data from FTA to the newer Kiteworks system. HBS declined to comment on why the Business School did not migrate to the new system before the breach.
In December, UNC2546 installed software that allowed the group to “execute commands on the compromised system” — which, in this case, involved the exfiltration of sensitive data — according to Ibrahima. The other group, UNC2582, then began extorting data theft victims in January.
With “significant overlaps” between the two groups, Mandiant now believes they are “related,” according to Ibrahima. He said the data stolen in the hack was the same data used to extort, thereby linking the groups.
Ibrahima also said that larger organizations tend to be at risk for “potentially widespread data theft and disclosure.”
Accellion has announced it will not be renewing FTA after April 30, and HUIT announced in February that Kiteworks would be made available to 9 out of 12 schools in the University, in addition to Radcliffe, FAS, and the Central Administration.
HUIT spokesperson Tim Bailey wrote that the breach only affected the Business School. The Business School declined to comment.
Zabierek said threat groups are often financially motivated to extort victims of data theft for money. She added that the data can end up with far-reaching entities.
“People looking to use that information could range anywhere between criminals through potentially nation-state actors,” she said. “So it’s not only just a question of personal security and data security and company security as far as all your data is concerned, but it’s also a national security issue as well.”
For affected students, Ibrahima recommended credit monitoring, calling the compromising of social security numbers as “pretty tangible and pretty serious.”
As for HBS, Ibrihma recommended that the school ensure “products are up to date” — either by patching or migrating to the newest available product. He also recommended regular review of logs from Internet-facing devices “for any anomalous activity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen apologized Wednesday for what he called “insensitive and inappropriate” content posted on a Counseling and Mental Health Services anti-Asian racism resources webpage, which included telling students “you may wish that you weren’t Asian.”
One of the now-deleted tips — intended to help students cope with the recent rise in anti-Asian racism and attacks — reads, “When you experience racism, you can feel shame. You may wish that you weren’t Asian, but remember that your ancestors likely went through similar or even worse incidents.”
Though the resources page was first posted last year, it garnered widespread attention Wednesday after screenshots of the page circulated on social media. Students and other Harvard affiliates criticized the page, saying that it placed the burden on Asian Americans to cope with the racist attacks, made assumptions about students’ feelings, and upheld the stereotype of Asians as a model minority.
According to internet archives, the page was originally posted in spring 2020. Previously, the top of the page cited an “increase in anti-Asian racism and xenophobia” since the Covid-19 pandemic as the impetus for providing the resources.
“Although most individuals are not racist and these events are infrequent, these incidents can often be stressful and traumatic. To help manage, here are some resources and helpful information,” the earlier version of the page prior to the Atlanta shootings read.
That paragraph was replaced last week with a new statement that acknowledged the “emotional and mental impact” of the Atlanta spa shootings on March 16, in which eight people were killed, six of whom were Asian women.
“While Anti-Asian sentiment has existed long before COVID-19, the increase in numbers is incredibly staggering – just as much as they are heartbreaking,” the updated page read.
Later on Wednesday, most of the page was deleted, leaving only links to resources collected by organizations outside Harvard. The page is now topped with the statement from Nguyen that apologizes for causing further distress to readers of the page, which he said contradicted CAMHS’s mission to support students.
“We are deeply sorry that some recently-posted content on our website not only fell short of that mission, but caused more stress in our community,” Nguyen wrote in the statement. “We had intended to post helpful resources for our Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander communities that we know are hurting in light of recent events around us, but what we ultimately posted included some insensitive and inappropriate content that we have now removed.”
Nguyen added that HUHS would “work diligently to ensure that this never happens again.”
According to HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry, CAMHS chief Barbara Lewis worked with Nguyen on the response.
Perry added that next steps for HUHS and CAMHS will include scrutinizing internal review policies for releasing public materials, particularly through the lens of diversity and inclusion. HUHS will also work with Harvard’s Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging to engage with diverse communities more regularly.
As the page began circulating online, Harvard affiliates reacted with shock and anger, which continued even after the page was updated.
Eliot House Resident Dean Andrea Wright wrote an email to the House affiliates offering her support in response to what she called “incredibly harmful language” on the resource page.
“I want to reassure you that it IS NOT too much to ask that Harvard, an institution where you belong and a place that you call home, respond sensitively and with a strong imperative for action against such despicable acts,” Wright wrote. “I know the statement has been removed, but I want to acknowledge the harm that was done and remind you that I see you and I care about you.”
Joshua Y. Chiang ’22 posted a TikTok Wednesday, which has been viewed over 230,000 times as of early Friday morning, sharing his disbelief at the message.
Chiang said in an interview that he believes the message was well-intentioned, but “the execution was poor.” He questioned what the review process for the page looked like and who may have approved its posting.
When asked who approved the page before it was posted, Perry declined to comment beyond the apology on the website.
After seeing screenshots of the webpage on Instagram, Caron S. Kim ’24 said it made her feel that CAMHS would be “one of the last places that people would want to go” for mental health services. She said she found its advice telling students that their ancestors faced worse and that they should avoid going outside alone “completely insensitive and ignorant.”
She added that if CAMHS had wanted the resources to be useful to students in the first place, they should have been distributed over email, rather than under the resources tab of its website, which she said likely played a part in students not noticing it until this week.
Though she appreciated the apology, Kim said she felt CAMHS was publicly pressured in issuing it, and “they were covering their tracks.” It shrugged off what “people found problematic about their statement under the reason of ‘we were just trying to help,’” she said.
Jeanna Y. Shaw ’24, a member of the Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies, said she appreciated most of the resources and links on the page, but found the “you may wish you weren’t Asian” statement “horrible.”
“That’s a bold claim,” Shaw said. “I wouldn’t give up being Asian for anything.”
She said she then felt “really angry” about being told to “‘remember that your ancestors likely went through similar or even worse incidents’” because it reminded her of how Asian Americans have historically been told to act as the model minority and endure their hardships quietly.
“They don’t know what my ancestors went through,” Shaw said. “And I don’t think that their trauma should be used as a tool to get me to feel a certain way. This probably isn't their intention, but it comes off as like, ‘Be grateful that you don't have to go through what they went through.’”
“This language brings back this whole history of how Asian Americans are supposed to just keep our heads down and work hard and not make a fuss and just do our own thing without actually dismantling the problems that we face,” Shaw added.
One of the statements on the webpage encouraged students to seek out and create art highlighting the Asian community “in a positive light.”
As a member of The Wave, Harvard’s Asian literary and arts magazine, Shaw — who considers herself a “creator” — said she found that advice to be harmful and “censoring.”
“I feel like this is totally misrepresenting the role of art in Asian America because it’s kind of saying that we’re only allowed to talk about the positive things, when actually a lot of art that we see in this space is a way for people to process trauma,” Shaw said. “A lot of it is painful and a lot of it is sad, and all of it is productive.”
When Alexander K. Park ’23 first saw the post Wednesday, he said he laughed at it in disbelief. After further reflection, however, he grew more “angry” and “disappointed.”
“The fact that the language implied that I may want to throw away a part of myself, or that I may not want to be Asian, was very hurtful,” Park said. “It shouldn’t be our fault or our responsibility to run away from being Asian — it should be the responsibility of society to accept Asian Americans as part of the American fabric.”
He added that the page failed to address the “root problem” of violence against Asian Americans: white supremacy and systemic hatred. Instead, Park said, the page proposed very “surface-level” and “performative” solutions. He said its suggestion to make art seemed to ask Asian Americans to “conform” and “contribute to a society that isn’t accepting of them.”
“It again puts the onus and the burden on Asian Americans to solve the question, and not on the system and not on the oppressors,” Park said.
Chiang said the most important part of the apology to him was the promise of change and next steps on the part of HUHS.
“Whether things will actually change or how drastic the change that they implement will be is unclear as of now,” he said. “A lot of the times when people apologize, it’s for optics, so I’m very curious to see if actual change will be made.”
“The only way that CAMHS and the University can really make amends for this lapse is to prove in the future, time and again, that they are committed to racial equality and racial equity,” Park said. “And to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again in the future.”

I would like to preface this “How To: A Spring Break During a Week of Class” article by letting everyone know that I procrastinated for a week on writing this because my brain has been taking a super inconvenient break from engaging with anything productive. But, here I am to tell YOU how to take your own mini, pretend, non-existent, imaginary, yet idyllic spring break while still getting through your classes — because spring break is a state of mind that can happen whenever you want it to happen… or at least that’s what they want us to think about Wellness Days.
~Sleep~
First off: sleep. Super important, I have found. Be a rebel and don’t listen to that little voice in your head that tells you that you’ll wake up at 8 a.m. to start your work tomorrow morning — that voice can be very evil. Instead, try to get your work done a little early, maybe even skip the Netflix (I’m no pro at this), and hit the hay.
Find Your Relaxation Technique
Anything that can give you a little bit of a mental break is honestly 1000000 percent worth it. I’m not a huge meditation person, because I personally hate the idea of sitting down and reflecting on myself (that’s probably why I should do some meditation), but if you enjoy a little deep thinking when you wake up or before you go to bed, leave yourself some time to do that! If meditation isn’t for you, maybe try to loosen up the creaky ol’ joints in between Zooms with some yoga or a little stretching. If you’re super anti-meditation/yoga/generally connecting with the mind, spirit, etc., I’ve found it can be so helpful to at least plan a little bit of time in your day where you completely disconnect from schoolwork and do something that you enjoy and fully embrace the spring break mindset.
Maybe Talk To People
Maybe instead of that deep internal thinking, you’re defrosting from the winter and are looking to meet some new people! If so, you could go outside to study or relax and interact with some fresh faces. Or, you could try to connect with that study buddy from your class over Zoom, or text that old friend to FaceTime and catch up. Sometimes, making some space in your life for chill, no pressure conversations can be one of the best ways to unwind and hit the reset button.
Actually Take A Wellness Day?
If all else fails… try treating a Wellness Day as a true Wellness Day. If it doesn’t bring you wellness, don’t do it. And if your TF asks why you handed in your assignment late, (well then you can just tell them to go Well themselves) refer them to Harvard’s Wellness Day policy and hope for the best. The Zoom burnout is real, and sometimes it can feel like there’s not a lot of ways to escape the work you have to get done. Try even little things — skip that early office hour you don’t really need to go to, miss an optional (or not so optional) assignment, or just do *something* that reduces your stress, because you deserve it!
So, give yourself a week — or at least a day — where you do at least a few things things that makes you feel a little better, and not like a sad little train chugging along the tracks unenthusiastically. Channel some happy, speedy, adventurous train vibes and mix it up!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Episode 2 of Under Review, hosts Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham rewind 40 years to the story of the 1980 report, “A Study of Race Relations at Harvard College,” and ask why it seems to have been forgotten in recent University climate survey efforts. Listen and subscribe on Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
About Under Review:
How can Harvard, an institution with so much history, have so little memory?
The racial reckonings and Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country this past summer brought attention to a trend in how Harvard seems to deal with student activism and concerns surrounding race, racism, and diversity: to commission a diversity review. These committees and reports long predate this summer, and reading them it can seem, at times, like some things have not changed at the University — in race relations, Harvard’s review process, or the findings and recommendations. What can these diversity reviews accomplish, and what can’t they?
“Under Review” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson, hosted by Matteo Wong and Olivia Oldham, chairs of The Crimson’s weekly magazine, Fifteen Minutes. Each week, they will explore controversies and diversity reviews stretching across 40 years of Harvard history, speaking to dozens of students, activists, experts, and more, to try and understand how the Harvard diversity review works — or doesn’t.
“Under Review” is produced by Zing Gee and Thomas Maisonneuve. Music by Ian Chan. Art by Meera S. Nair.
