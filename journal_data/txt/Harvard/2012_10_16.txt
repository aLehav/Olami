After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Emily Dickinson once wrote in a poem, “There is no Frigate like a Book / To take us Lands away.” Many of the most successful works of literature accomplish just that. But “The Beach at Galle Road,” the debut collection of Joanna Luloff‘s short stories, is proof that this is not a sufficient criterion for a book to be considered good. While Luloff paints an enticing, vibrant image of Sri Lanka within the various interweaving stories that constitute her work, this depiction, informed by her work there as a Peace Corps volunteer, does not redeem the book’s deep flaws.
For a writer, the title of a work can often be a potent tool. One would think that “The Beach at Galle Road” could serve such a function—very little of the book actually takes place at a beach—yet in this respect it fails spectacularly. Its significance is explicitly stated in the collection’s second story, when a character thinks to her sister, “Which way are you headed on Galle road, Lakshmi? What stories will you tell me about the journeys you will take?” None of the subtlety that could come with such a title is present; the reader knows almost immediately that Galle road unequivocally represents the paths one follows in life and hope for the future. And yet Luloff constantly assaults the reader with the significance of “Galle road” as the book goes on, to the point that its appearance becomes mind-numbing as opposed to an invitation to discover its meaning, as it should be.
Indeed, Luloff’s greatest weakness as a writer is that she finds it very difficult to leave anything unsaid. She constantly chooses to tell, not show, the reader the world that she depicts to the point that she at one instance writes of a character, “He doesn’t notice that he is leaving red fingerprints along his throat and under the collar of his shirt,” a blatant disobeying of the limited point-of-view which Luloff typically uses.
In other cases she does not permit the reader to interpret details that could have a powerful impact on one’s interpretation of the text if he or she were not explicitly told how to interpret it. Luloff has one character, Nilanthi, choose to recite Keats’ “Ode to a Grecian Urn” for an English competition. On its own, this instance could powerfully inform the reader’s view of the Nilanthi; this moment is spoiled, however, when her mother muses, “Why had her daughter chosen this poem about sacrifice…about a village by the sea growing silent and empty?” At points it seems as if Luloff’s primary goal in her writing is to eliminate any modicum of ambiguity; yet she fails to recognize that she is writing fiction, and doing so gravely compromises the quality of her work, as the reader is deprived of the privilege to interpret the characters on their own.
Were the collection a complete loss, perhaps these flaws would not be so disappointing. But, while “The Beach at Galle Road” has its share of failures, it succeeds in providing a beautifully transporting experience for the reader. One cannot read Luloff’s lush description of Sri Lanka and not long to venture to the “turquoise sea” she describes, eat the “green graham and coconut, some chili on the side to combat the blandness” or the “butter fruit mashed up into a frothy, sweet shake or drizzled with treacle.” “The Beach at Galle Road” works as an account of place because Luloff has employed a crucial aspect of good writing, in that she chooses to write what she knows. Her stories are so potently infused with colorful description and detail that, while the collection does not necessarily qualify as a great work of literature, it is an enjoyable read if it is accepted for what it is.
But it may be quite easy to fall into the trap of misplacing one’s expectations for Luloff’s book. She is describing Sri Lanka during a time of upheaval, and this upheaval does figure into all of her stories; however, when the conflict is not central to the story, its inclusion often seems forced. Perhaps this is because Luloff so well describes what is positive and beautiful about Sri Lanka; in this context, references to true despair and destruction appear nearly impossible. When Luloff does focus on the conflict and its repercussions, however, what she writes is powerful. Nilanthi, for example, once had great expectations for her life, as revealed in one of the earlier stories in the collection. By her appearance at the end of the book, she is ultimately crippled by a suicide attempt and accompanied only by the ghosts of those she loved. These moving revelations, however, are largely crowded in the final stories of the collection. “The Beach at Galle Road” thus cannot be read as an account of the civil war in Sri Lanka if one does not desire to be sorely disappointed.
Dickinson was not incorrect when she wrote, “There is no Frigate like a Book,” but the quality of a book cannot be determined solely by whether or not it transports its reader to another place and gives them a lust for some far-off land. “The Beach at Galle Road” is enjoyable because it potently acts as such a frigate, but it is riddled with flaws that tragically prevent it from being a good book. Luloff’s debut is perhaps the sort of book one would recommend for beach reading, but only were the recomendee not the sort to read any book critically. For, although Luloff’s collection stands strong when judged by Dickinson’s criteria, it cannot hold up under a more critical eye.

In her latest novel “The Round House,” Louise Erdrich weaves a tale of crime and justice through the eyes of a 13-year-old Ojibwe boy, Joe. His life on an Indian reservation in North Dakota is a world removed from the America most readers are familiar with; here, Indian law reigns sovereign and poverty runs rampant. After his mother is raped under clouded circumstances and a host of political complications come into play, Joe and his friends set out to unveil the truth and restore justice, with or without the help of the law. Erdrich’s setting is expertly crafted. She conveys both the rich cultural history that remains on reservations, passed through oral histories and knowledge, as well as the isolation and disempowerment in daily life. Through unadorned writing and relentlessly paced action, Erdrich fills this memorable landscape with a vengeful, powerful story.
“I had a fat Indian for a husband at one time,” one character recalls. “His pecker was long and big but only the head reached past his gut. And of course I didn’t like to get underneath him anyway for fear of getting smashed…[His belly] grew big as a hill and I couldn’t see over it. I’d call out, Are you still back there? Holler to me!” One would not expect to encounter such funny, overtly sexual scenes in a book whose central tension derives from an egregious act of rape. The fact that they coexist side-by-side marks a straightforwardness inherent throughout “The Round House,” as Erdrich favors an honest presentation over plying to expectations. These scenes of the older generation boisterously cackling over their sexual exploits, much to the horror of the young narrator and his friends, are not merely comic interludes; they are integral to painting a realistic world, a fuller picture of family ties on this reservation in the late 80s. Erdrich binds the novel together through two seemingly disparate elements that together create a depth to her depiction: the spiritual world of sweat lodges, mythology, and tales of ancestry, alongside a legal history of court cases pertaining to  reservation law. With these complex, in-depth descriptions, Erdrich effectively conveys the poverty, love, isolation, and rich culture that govern reservation life.
Erdrich favors fast-paced action to keep the story moving forward. While this approach does not leave much room for emotional analysis, it makes the book easy to digest as well as realistic, given Joe’s young age at the time of the story. Aside from jaunts into family tales and past court cases, the novel follows a relatively linear plot; it moves at a quick clip and has suspense expertly built in. Little time elapses between chapters, and once a question is posed, it does not take too long to find out the answer. For instance, the identity of Joe’s mother’s rapist is known before the book even reaches its halfway point; from then on, it is just a question of how and if justice will be restored. Knowing who the rapist is halfway through the book creates more tension, as Joe’s family tries to emotionally recover from the incident while still pursuing justice.
Erdrich includes very few loose ends or connections that the reader must make for themselves, and this technique of overt connections does not detract from the suspense of the story. One of the most long-standing mysteries in the book concerns the fate of Joe’s friend Cappy, who Erdrich reveals at the outset of the book to have died by the time Joe is narrating his tale, years later. While this mystery surrounding his death is certainly not the driving force of the narrative, the mysterious undercurrent colors the reader’s entire relationship to Cappy, as the cause of his death is not revealed until the final pages. Erdrich’s choice to first introduce this character with his end in sight is narratively risky, but it fits in well with the overall tone of desperation present throughout the book.
Another example of these connections includes a time when Cappy’s brother tells Joe about a vision he saw during a sweat lodge. When Joe sees a dark shape in the bushes a few nights later with a silver glow about him, Erdrich makes sure the reader draws the connection between the two incidents by explicitly stating the connection.
Erdrich seems generally averse to ambiguity in language and events, though she certainly does not stay away from nuance in the ideas and themes that she explores. Indeed, her straightforward language and presentation of events, which can at times create the effect of spoon-feeding the reader, allows her the leeway to delve into the ambiguous emotional and historical territory, once described by her as a tangled skein, as successfully as she does.
For instance, Joe’s uncle’s girlfriend Sonja is initially introduced as a weather-beaten ex-stripper; as Joe begins to interact with her more, though, Erdrich reveals her to be a much deeper character than first portrayed. She is resilient, tough, funny, and initially an unexpected ally for Joe. When he entrusts her with a secret—that he has found $40,000 in a doll floating in a lake—she drives him around to banks all over the state to deposit the money in savings accounts for his college tuition and stresses that he must not tell anyone about the money, for whoever lost it will want it back. After serving as an emotional refuge for Joe, Sonja eventually begins taking this money and spending it on expensive clothing and earrings. In the end, she takes nearly all the money to run away from Joe’s uncle and live on her own.
Erdrich delicately handles the issue of female disempowerment in the character of Sonja by portraying this behavior more permissively than one would expect. Though the reader might fault Sonja’s actions as weakness of character, Erdrich sympathizes with Sonja’s mistreatment—nearly every man she encounters, even Joe, treats her as an object because she is pretty, and she has low feelings of self-worth because of this. Erdrich portrays Sonja’s escape with the money almost as a victory: the $40,000 came from another case of female abuse and disempowerment. Thus, the money that would have improved the life of one mistreated woman finds its way into the hands of another. In a story with so much injustice, this one small, nearly hidden victory seems a large one.
Erdrich’s nuanced treatment of Sonja’s character is just one of many instances where she approaches complex moral and legal stances, a rich cultural history, and a long history of abuse with a deft hand. Her straightforward language belies the labyrinthine nature of the events and history she depicts. Although not all the characters may not be unique like Sonja, and though the simple writing and the story may fade in memory, Erdrich’s portrayal of the isolation and rich culture that define reservation life forms a powerfully memorable backdrop to this tale of vigilante justice.

In the opening scene of “Seven Psychopaths,” two gangsters discuss the statistical probability of shooting a person in the eyeball, eyeball-related torture, and “the chick-killing shakes.” A masked gunman casually strides up behind the pair and shoots them both in the head. This is Psycho No. 1.
Director and Screenwriter Martin McDonagh’s newest film, “Seven Psychopaths,” is a complex action-comedy where the driving characters, are all, as evidenced by the aforementioned scene, psychopaths. The single exception is the ostensibly sane though alcoholic Marty (Colin Farrell), who has no control over events whatsoever. Marty is a writer struggling to conjure up nutcase characters for his own screenplay—also called “Seven Psychopaths”—when his explosive friend Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) overhauls the creative process and Marty’s personal life. Billy has a couple of psychopathic tendencies of his own as well as a mobster’s missing shih-tzu on his couch, which precludes an increasingly chaotic spiral of flashbacks, headshots, imagined endings—and even a Yalie hooker and an out-of-context Vietcong. “Seven Psychopaths,” though dark, proceeds with a snappy wit that renders it consistently entertaining and never dolorous or dismal due to the comic talent and an avoidance of prolonged violence.
A fair amount of time is spent trying to work out who exactly the seven psychopaths are before just giving up and assuming everyone is crazy. However, the plot, though difficult at times, somehow works. While the movie is at once revenge flick, buddy comedy, mystery and voyage of self-discovery, the various strands fit together to make a slightly trippy ride. Granted, the overriding premise of a mobster turning LA upside down in search of a missing shih-tzu—three guesses why that breed was chosen—is absurd to begin with.
While the American setting is a departure from McDonagh’s earlier work, “Seven Psychopaths” does contain some of the same themes. The blends of immaturity and violence recall Farrell’s hitman role from “In Bruges,” and the tale of a man obsessed past the point of murder with a small domesticated animal is a feature from McDonagh’s play “The Lieutenant of Inishmore.”
The jokes, while tending to the puerile, are nonetheless hilarious. McDonagh, while producing a witty script, also gives great scope for his actors to display their comedic talent. Farrell is superb as the beleaguered Marty, all jerking shoulders and panicky eyes, moving from scene to scene with the look of a man who’s had something explode in his face. There is real brilliance in his interplay with the other primary characters, particularly Billy and Hans (Christopher Walken). Walken himself commands scenes with gravitas whether scattergun cussing or interacting with a hallucinogenic cacti. He captures both absurdity and subtle intensity with a soft-spoken and deeply convincing ease that belies his character’s far-fetched story.
It is, however, the cataclysmic butting of heads between Rockwell and Charlie Costello (Woody Harrelson) that drives the story. Despite not meeting until the final scene, a constant power struggle builds as the boundary between reality and Marty’s screenplay grows thin. Harrelson is at once petulant, pathetic, and occasionally terrifying. In one scene he ambles confusedly into a hospital ward with an enormous chrome handgun and creates an atmosphere of incredible tension simply by playing in a wheelchair and talking about his dog. As for Rockwell, his volatile, impulsive breed of psychopath can barely be described without spoilers.
On the writing side, McDonagh undoubtedly spins a tale that is fast paced and bloody but with a wit that sets it apart from the clumsy dialogue of many action films. The violence, while pervasive, is not gratuitous; there is an artistic quality to the splashes of blood—in this world it never dries or clots—and Hans’ shirt stays brightly splattered for days.  There are repeating themes; the burning man, the murder of murderers, abandonment by women. It is not for nothing that Charlie trusts his dog more than his girlfriend. Even the characters themselves note the absence of significant female characters through the metatheatre of Marty’s screenplay—excepting Linda Bright Clay’s brief, impressive scene opposite Harrelson. In the words of the wonderfully controversial Billy, “You can’t let the animals die. Just the women.”
The themes of murder, suicide and revenge that McDonagh twists through the tales of the psychopaths have a haunting aftertaste, though they are shot with a briskness that defies gloom. Above all, however, it is the foul-mouthed, rollicking, spaced-out wit that makes “Seven Psychopaths” such a thoroughly entertaining film.

When looking at James E. Casebere’s work for the first time, one is immediately struck by a sense of puzzlement: is it real, or isn’t it? This confusion arises because his photography, which depicts hand-made miniature models primarily of architectural spaces, falls somewhere in between the realistic and the artificial. Casebere’s often stark constructions tend to tackle social, political, and historical issues, conveying his narratives solely through physical structures. His work has been shown at numerous galleries around the world, including the Whitney Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Montréal in Montreal, and the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, England. A visiting lecturer on Visual and Environmental Studies here at Harvard, he will be giving an Artist Talk presented by the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts on Thursday at 6 p.m.
The Harvard Crimson: All of your work seems to incorporate aspects of two different traditional genres of art—sculpture, or construction of models, and photography. Do you see yourself more as a photographer or a sculptor, and which aspect kind of drives your artistic vision for a new piece?
James E. Casebere: I’m thinking about what I’m working on right now, which is a landscape. It’s actually a model, a big sprawling model of the hills of Jamaica with a beach in the foreground, but with all the rough edges showing. And it’s really a combination of [sculpture and photography], maybe more so than other images which look more seamless. On the one hand, I want to create this illusion of a place and a time—a time of day, an atmosphere—and I want an element of illusion. But because I’m equally interested in the construction itself, I want the viewer to see all the rough edges and to see how the plaster becomes the beach, becomes the hill, or [becomes] the rocks in the water. So that there’s a point at which the illusion and the artifice are clearly a construction and you see both simultaneously, in a somewhat rougher way than some of the “Landscape with Houses” photographs that I’ve done more recently.
THC: Given that you have a recurring theme of the individual versus society, is there a reason you decide not to include any human figures in your models?
JEC: I guess I just don’t see any need for it. When I first started taking pictures, I animated some element of the image so there was an actor in each picture. For example, the first of these constructed photographs that I made was a fan sitting on a pillow in what was supposed to be a living room, and so the fan was anthropomorphized and the actor in the image. Or in another picture there was a fork stuck in a refrigerator, so to a certain extent the fork is a stand-in for...the person. But as I continued to work I wanted to take...the actor/participant out, and put the viewer in, so the viewer would project [himself] into the space instead of standing outside of it looking at someone else. That was the idea.
THC: A number of your works involve flooding your models. Would you mind explaining how this idea came about and how it contributes to the message of your work?
JEC: Sure. Well, it really came about from a trip I took to Berlin in 1998 when I visited Potsdamer Platz after the fall of the Berlin Wall when it was a vast empty plain and look[ed] at all the plans for future development on that site. I picked up a couple of books in the bookstore there that had pictures of the sewer system and the subway system of Berlin as well as the bunkers under the Reichstag, and I think what I was struck by at the time was the optimism and energy and enthusiasm about the future with the unification of Germany, and I just kept thinking about the past. I was thinking about what was lost, and forgotten, and the historic unconscious. So when I first started to make pictures using water, I actually tried to work from some of these pictures of the sewers and subways. The first one that I felt succeeded with water was a picture called “Flooded Hallway,” which looks very much like one of the bunkers of the Reichstag. Water was really about memory and loss, and all those associations—the historic loss, I guess.
THC: It seems like the use of water in your work makes your photographs look less like photographs of physical constructed models and more like paintings. Was that intentional?
JEC: When I started using water I also started using more color, and so I began to think about [the pieces] differently, because the water involved the use of movement and reflection, and in many cases the light that was reflected off the water would break down the structure itself visually. So it became less about the walls and more about the surface plane of the image itself. So yeah, they were more related to painting in that sense. Instead of being about absence and deprivation, they were just the opposite—they became more about overflow, I guess, literally. And you know kind of sensory overload. But visually, they were more about the two-dimensional surface than the three-dimensional space.

CORRECTION: Oct. 18
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that James E. Casebere’s talk on Thursday at the Carpenter Center was at 8 p.m. In fact, it is scheduled for 6 p.m.

That “Argo,” the newest film directed by Ben Affleck, is based on a true story is likely the primary justification for green-lighting the project in the first place. On paper, the narrative combination of a tense Iran hostage situation and the farcical inner workings of the Hollywood film industry sounds absurd and risky. The dissonance between the situations is nearly irreconcilable, but “Argo” manages to deftly weave both together to create a fun reversal of the “heist movie” sub-genre in which the stakes are considerably higher.
The film opens with the fall of the US Embassy in November of 1979. While most of the embassy’s employees were taken hostage, six managed to escape and take shelter at the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). Realizing that any boilerplate cover story will not be strong enough to get them out of Iran, the CIA brings in Tony Mendez (Affleck), who is regarded as an expert in exfiltration. Mendez suggests that the six trapped men and women pose as members of a Canadian film crew.
From there, the film’s second act follows Mendez’s quest to Hollywood to meet with John Chambers (John Goodman), a makeup artist and occasional CIA consultant. As Mendez jets into LA, the film shows a digital recreation of the Hollywood sign, which had fallen into heavy disrepair in the ‘70s—a not-so-subtle metaphor for the industry itself. Interestingly enough, the sign was restored in 1978, before the events in “Argo” occur.
Chambers and Mendez also find a producer, Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), to set up a shell production company. It’s shrewd casting, since it allows Arkin and Goodman, two of the best character actors working today and veterans of the Hollywood system, to play off each other and offer line after snappy line of criticism towards their own industry. “You can teach a rhesus monkey to be a director in a day,” quips Goodman in his first scene. When the team realizes they will actually have to buy the script for “Argo,” Arkin quickly wisecracks, “You’re worried about the Ayatollah? Try the WGA.”
From there, Mendez sets off to Iran to prep the trapped Americans. This is easily the dullest part as the film focuses on the reservations held by these six particularly unestablished characters. They are human MacGuffins: catalyst for the plot and little else. Do they go along? I wouldn’t dare reveal that, but I will remind you that “Argo” is Based On A True Story.
While the hand-wringing in Ken Taylor’s living room is artificial, the film climaxes with a remarkably nerve-racking airport sequence that makes TSA frustrations look trivial. It’s Murphy’s Law in action, as all of the spinning plates in Mendez’s story wobble and nearly shatter.
While “Argo” almost always manages to strike a balance between the real-life tension of the situation and its outlandish premise, the tones occasionally clash. This is no clearer than in a sequence in which Affleck cuts between an ostentatious table read of the sci-fi screenplay meant to drum up buzz from the press and a press conference in which the Iranian hostage-takers list their demands. The sequence is meant to portray how this Hollywood circus is serving a greater good, but it lays on the sermonizing a little too thickly.
The greatest asset of “Argo” is its sizable cast of “that guy” actors. Zeljko Ivancek, Titus Welliver, Kyle Chandler, Richard Kind, and Philip Baker Hall are all on hand to don the campiest of ‘70s fashion and hairstyles. The most important of these parts belongs to Bryan Cranston, who chews scenery as Mendez’s pragmatic CIA superior. Shortly before a meeting with the secretary of state, Cranston offers up an apt analogy that “It’s like those two old fucks from the Muppets.”
With “Argo,” Ben Affleck  once again managed to show his skill as a director, combining scenarios of Hollywood excess and pessimistic espionage operations. As Arkin states when briefed on the situation “We did suicide missions in the Army that had better odds than this.” The same thought encapsulates “Argo,” which probably shouldn’t work nearly as well as it actually does.—Staff writer Brian A.

“This would be the worst movie ever made if it wasn’t true,” says Ben Affleck of his new movie “Argo” that came out Friday. “It would seem completely absurd.” The film, which Affleck both stars in and directs, tells the remarkable tale of how a fake sci-fi film saved the lives of six Americans hiding in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979. Argo appealed to Affleck’s interest in the Middle East, dating back to his one year as a Middle Eastern Studies major at Occidental College in Los Angeles. He liked that it was set in the 1970’s, his favorite film era, and, most importantly, it gave him the chance to prove he could successfully direct a film not set in his home town. “Everyone just thought of me as Boston guy. ‘Sure I guess he can do a movie in Boston, but if you take him to Providence he’s not going to know what he’s doing.’” So a lot was at stake. “I saw my future career kind of being dictated by it.”
In preparation for the film, Affleck spent a lot of time with Tony Mendez, the real CIA exfiltration expert behind the rescue mission. “You sit down and talk to someone who cavalierly talks about, ‘Well we went into South East Asia and we had to get this guy out,’ like during Vietnam and getting people out of Russia, and you just think, ‘How could you have this for a living, for a life? He’s got the intelligence star. He’s one of the 50 most important CIA guys of all time.’ You realize you’re sitting with the real deal, and there’s nothing that makes you feel inadequate like sitting with the real deal.”
But basing a movie off real events and the lives of living people presented some challenges. “If you change any little thing in it, you’re like, ‘Shit, I’m lying,’” says Affleck. Regarding one particular incident in the film which departs from reality, he explains, “It was sort of a way of externalizing their internal pressure, because [you’re] just shooting someone for a while, and you, like, imagine their panicking. At a certain point it doesn’t come across as much.”
Affleck also had to figure out how to navigate the still politically sensitive subject of Iranian relations. The day Argo premiered at the Toronto Film Festival, by sheer coincidence it seemed, Canada closed their embassy in Tehran. “You usually do a period movie, and it kind of fades away. People forget about the story—it happened a long time ago. This movie keeps getting more relevant.”
An introductory segment at the beginning of the film was added in an attempt to frame the political context and tone. “I’m not trying to editorialize, but it’s important to understand before we just jump into this movie and we’ve got guys jumping up and down breaking windows and yelling ‘Marg-bar Amreeka,’ which means death to America.... For better or for worse, here’s the truth.”
He also says he hopes people don’t misinterpret his political views after his visible presence at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. “You can write me off as a liberal or whatever, even though I hold more complicated positions than that, but I don’t want you to write the movie off.”
At the time of the Iran hostage crisis, Affleck was the same age as his fictional son in the film, but he doesn’t remember hearing about it. “You know what I do remember even earlier than that? I remember Kennedy’s primary challenge of Carter, because it was such a big deal, and all my friends at school were getting so whipped up about Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy.... In Boston I didn’t know anything about the hostages, I just knew about Ted Kennedy.”
Luckily, now that he’s got a non-Boston film under his belt, he can make another Boston-based movie—the infamous story of Whitey Bulger that will be written by Terence Winters, directed by Affleck, and starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck. “It’s an amazing story, as you know. It’s really tough story because it’s so long.... I wanna go from Alcatraz—and they experimented on him with LSD—all the way to ending up in the farmer’s market in Santa Monica and he’s 83 years old. It’s tricky … to have it get that far and have it have resonance instead of just like, ‘Killed this person, pulled out their teeth, shot this guy, robbed this....’ So we’re working on it.”

Detroit rapper Big Sean began his rise to stardom the old-fashioned way, stalking Kanye West’s 2007 “Graduation” publicity stop at a local radio station. An auspicious hallway rendez-vous turned into Big (government name: Sean Anderson) rabidly freestyling for 10 minutes as he accompanied Mr. West from the studio to his idling limo. Two years later, Sean’s run-in with Mr.West landed him a deal with the mogul’s Def Jam-affiliated G.O.O.D. Music label. In the meantime, Sean built his name on a series of viral mixtapes and a rigorous string of tours across college campuses. In many circles, he’s credited with inventing the “Supa Dupa flow,” a stripped-down simile/metaphor construction in which the poetic “like” and “as” are replaced by two juxtaposed images, their similarities inferred by a single pause. In the aptly titled “Supa Dupa,” Sean raps: “Used to be bottom—scuba/So I’m on the grind—skateboard or scooter.” Never reticent, Sean even filed faux-beefs with several more popular artists who supposedly borrowed his technique: Drake, T.I., and Ludacris, among others.
Fast forward to 2012, and after a strong feature on Kanye West’s smash single “Mercy” and the release of his stellar mixtape “Detroit,” Sean has arrived in a unique position. He has built a cult following on the strength of his innuendo-smothered witticisms, but also parlayed it into a strong crossover buzz—recently collaborating with Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown and Justin Bieber—with little compromise on style or delivery. And while his latest work draws on the same themes of his past tapes, “Detroit” showcases Sean’s artistry that was largely dormant in his earlier work.
“Detroit” reaches the zenith of swag-rap atop the ruins of America’s former black music capital. The tone of the tape is set by three wistful Detroit vignettes from rap heavyweights Common, Young Jeezy, and the freshly-monikered Snoop Lion (the artist formerly known as Snoop Dogg, the artist formerly known as Snoop Doggy Dogg). Jeezy gravels off a tale of late-night carousing at “Sting,” a 24-hour strip club on Detroit’s West Side, and Snoop playfully recalls his teen years working the breakfast shift at a McDonald’s, where he was dubbed “Young Eggs” for his one-handed egg-cracking technique. These vignettes set the tone for Sean’s starkly contrasted sonic portraits of his hometown, which find him wistfully recalling cold nights in the “D” just as often as extravagant binges at local strip clubs.
Big, as his fans affectionately call him, wears many different Detroits on his sleeve in this latest offering. Roughly half the tracks lend themselves to late-night recreational car rides, while the rest speak better to a stack of one’s and a stiff drink at the aforementioned “Sting.” The mixtape leads off with “Higher,” where a dark, slowed-down Al Green sample and swelling strings accompany Sean as he contemplates—boastfully and pensively—his newfound fame. “24 Karats of Gold” features Sean and J. Cole waxing poetic over a sentimental piano loop, cleverly working through the what-ifs of his rise to superherodom: “Seems life’s never at a standstill, even in a photo / Thinkin’ ’bout the ex girl I hold though / Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho? / The things I think about the most are things I never know though.”
Perhaps the high point of the tape is “I’m Gonna Be,” when Sean recalls his brutally stubborn approach to getting famous atop a lush piano arrangement, sitting somewhere between gospel and early Kanye West. This track hits gold as Sean’s off-kilter flow and often intentionally out of tune singing are buttressed by recent Def Jam signee Jhene Aiko’s ethereal voice. Another standout on the tape is “100,” featuring Kendrick Lamar and Royce da 5’9”. And while such lyrical heavyweights like Kendrick and Royce might take Sean’s punch lines to task, he stands firmly on his own two feet alongside his more verbally dexterous peers.
The mixtape takes a left turn with club bangers like “Mula,” “Woke Up,” beat God Lex Luger-produced “FFOE,” and up-tempo “Do What I Gotta Do,” featuring mainstream darling Tyga. On “Mula,” Sean aggressively chews up a slow-burning, vicious Young Chop beat alongside the swaggering, stuttering French Montana, who boasts of his availability to sell drugs with a racially insensitive comparison to Harvard’s own Jeremy Lin ’10: “Got that China White, call it Jeremy Lin.” The addictive chorus, “Ain’t nothin’ more important than the Mula, the Mula!” has made the song arguably the biggest potential hit on “Detroit.”
While there may not be a Top 40 hit in the recesses of this .zip file, “Detroit” is a remarkably clever and digestible tape. Sean’s strength lies in his ability to straddle divergent sonic landscapes—introspective and melancholic, bombastic and stark—without losing his peculiar flow or his cutting-edge lyrical delivery.

Wordplays
Oct. 18-20 8:00 p.m.,
Oct. 21 2:00p.m.
Adams Pool
Directed by Nathan O. Hilgartner ‘14
Produced by Sasha G. Mironov ‘13
“I bet you get a lot of tail working the schizophrenic circuit.” So observes a waitress who is being pestered by a cocktail-swigging Princeton reject who thinks he’s the reincarnation of F. Scott Fitzgerald in “And One Fine Morning,” one of the three one-act plays that makes up “Wordplays,” a new production written and directed by Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14, a Crimson arts editor.
True to its name, “Wordplays” is a suite of plays dealing with humanity’s complex relationship with language. Hilgartner sees the building of identity through how we communicate to each other as a common theme throughout the show. “[‘Wordplays’] is really about how…we build ourselves textually. It runs this route from childhood to death, focused around the identity that comes out of text,” Hilgartner says. “All of these characters are constantly trying to figure out who they are with this act of creating something.”
For the modern-day Fitzgerald (Matthew J. Bialo ’15), this act of creation involves narrating a third-person story in real time about his ongoing interactions with the waitress (Danielle T. Lessard ’16), which simultaneously intrigues and repulses her. For a lonely gravedigger (Joshua G. Wilson ’13) in “The Necropolis,” the final play in the show, creation means spinning rhapsodic fictions to himself about the long-dead tenants of the cemetery he maintains.
“A lot of the discussion about how [Wilson] should approach this character has been metaphysical—whether he’s actually human or...a metaphysical phenomenon having to do with death and inscription and memory. It’s very dark,” says Hilgartner.
The first play in the set, “Block,” follows two kindergartners (Bialo and Lessard) who construct a “racetrack of death” out of blocks during their playtime, which eventually leads to one of them experiences an existential crisis about the fate of their fictional world. Stage Manager Matthew B. Barrieau ’16 says that the show’s status as a student-written, ultra-small production has made the the production’s development more collaborative. “There have definitely been a few rewrites along the way. It’s been interesting to see the way [the actors and producers] have gotten involved in that,” he says.
However, the irony of actors tweaking and adding to their characters’ identities in a show about constructing identity through language hasn’t been lost on Barrieau.
“It’s all very meta.”

Not all fairy tales end happily ever after.
That was the solemn note on which the grim new musical-in-progress “The Piper” left its audience this weekend during its first set of workshop performances, which starts at once upon a time and ends with the disappearance of an entire generation of children.
The show, with book and lyrics by Christian N. Føhrby ’14 and music by Copenhagen University musicology student Richard Plum, takes on one of the most disturbing of all children’s stories—that of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, the mysterious figure who danced into a storybook village to rid its residents of their rat problem and lured away their children while he was at it. While adding new characters and new political overtones, Fohrby and Plum’s take on the centuries-old tale does not shy away from the story’s haunting core. Writer-director Føhrby hopes to follow this two-weekend public workshop with a full staging at a later date, the early rendition of the script showed characters with absorbing emotional depth but a book and lyrics still in need of work.
In “The Piper,” Hamelin is a town beset not only by rats but also by a bumbling, reelection-obsessed mayor and a very unfavorable balance of trade. The simultaneous arrival of a band of merchants from Russia and a colorfully clothed stranger who says his flute can dispel disgusting critters seems to offer the solution to everyone’s problems. But the cost of the tuneful exterminator service is not cheap—the Piper demands a hatful of gold for his pest-killing performance. When the townspeople, spurred by the influence of the rumormongering youth Hannes (AJ Unitas Jr. ’16), refuse to pay the bill, the Piper extracts his revenge in horrific fashion.
The Piper and Hannes, who compete not only for economic influence but also for the affection of the mayor’s daughter (played with great feeling by Susanna B. Wolk ’14), formed an intriguing pair of characters who each mixed good and evil in catastrophic doses. As the Piper, Max R. McGillivray ’16 managed to be chilling when crafting his depraved plot to snatch the children while still tugging at sympathetic heartstrings up until the last moments of the show. All the while, McGillivray showed off the strongest vocals in the cast. With a finely controlled malicious streak, Unitas portrayed Hannes as an awkward young man pushed by his own insecurity over the brink into true villainy.
Other characters mostly offered comedic fodder to lighten the otherwise dismal story. In just a few lines, Joey R. Longstreet ’16 carved out a hilarious portrait of the one townsman who had grown fond of the ubiquitous rats. Taylor A. Cressler ’14 played the mayor with skillful physical comedy.
Performed as a workshop with scripts sometimes in hand, the show featured few traditional technical elements like costumes and scenery. The five-member, eight-piece band sat onstage behind the actors throughout the musical. Plum’s sophisticated compositions, brought to life by music director Madeline A. Smith ’14, charged the show with energy. Especially noteworthy was his cool use of a lilting European-style flute melody over a bass-and-guitar beat to create a modern-day sound for the Piper’s hypnotizing song.
Though the workshop was buoyed by a full slate of strong musical selections and by on-point actors, “The Piper” is still clearly a work in progress. Some of the show’s key plot points never quite made sense—how the mayor’s daughter somehow knew from the moment the Piper left town of the attack he would return to mount, and why the Piper, who seemed to have led a life filled with successful adventures before his very brief service to the city of Hamelin, would not brush off his humiliation but instead spend a year plotting his heinous revenge.
Most lyrics were one-dimensional and rhymes—like “kaput” with “suit”—were often clumsy. More significantly, the musical lost the opportunity to convey the full emotional impact of the children’s disappearance at the end of the show. No actors played children in the show, and no villager ever gave any indication of having a child, so until the moment the Piper came to take the children away, there was no build-up of familial ties that were doomed to be severed. After the Piper played and the townspeople woke up to find a generation wiped out, the script again failed to create a gut-wrenching moment. It detoured abruptly into a solo for the Russian salesman before returning to the presumably anguished parents—who showed more anger toward the Piper than grief over their unspeakably painful loss.
“The Piper,” ultimately, is a show about the terrible consequences of not keeping a promise—a message the production’s staff likely knows well. Their nascent work displayed great potential in its first staging, and as they revise it, it will undoubtedly fulfill that promise.

“How innovative can we dare to be?” asked Jessica L. Martinez ’95, the Harvard Art Museums’ Director of Academic and Public Programs, in her office the afternoon after the Wednesday kickoff of this year’s In-Sight Evenings event series. Organized by the Harvard Art Museums, the In-Sight Evenings have for three years featured presentations by museum staff and Harvard faculty on works in the Museums’ collections. At Wednesday’s event, titled “Preparing for the New Harvard Art Museums” and held in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Martinez and her colleagues discussed how they think the new museum facility on Quincy Street—scheduled for completion in 2014—will bring together academic disciplines and collections from throughout the Museums.
Though the In-Sight Evenings are often lectures, at the recent event Martinez and five curators spoke in three short dialogues about new points of focus for the Museums. “We don’t want to be an academic bunker,” Martinez said. “We’re a place of deep intellectual inquiry, but we’re also a home for the Harvard community in many ways.”
Michelle Lamunière, John R. and Barbara Robinson Family Assistant Curator of Photography and Elizabeth Rudy, Theodore Rousseau Assistant Curator of European Paintings, described the incorporation of photographs, paintings, and prints into exhibits displaying works of other media. They also explained the challenges of working with these paper-based materials, which are sensitive to light, humidity, and other atmospheric factors.
Such multi-media integration, as well as integration of works that use the same medium in different ways, will be the basis of some future Harvard Art Museums exhibits, Lamunière and Rudy said. Prototypes of this kind of mixed exhibition have already been experimented with in the galleries of the Sackler, which have at times even included pieces from other museums in the Harvard community. “The space then becomes much more vibrant and much more meaningful,” Rudy said.
Traditionally, Martinez said, the collections of the three Harvard Art Museums have been kept distinct. “Whereas before the collections were very separate, the Busch-Reisinger, the Fogg, and the Sackler, now these works are in closer proximity, so the kinds of questions that are raised are new and exciting,” Martinez said. “I think coming to the galleries this year and to gallery talks is a way to gear up for what’s coming.”
Francesca G. Bewer, Research Curator at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies and Melissa A. Moy, Cunningham Assistant Curator of Asian Art discussed the importance of the connection between the artistic side of their work and the technological aspect of it. They explained, for instance, how researchers can create 3D models that show how ancient Chinese bronzes were made. The curators hope to make such displays available to museum guests, they said. “The idea is that you can have x-rays or technical information in the galleries but still not distract from what is being displayed,” Bewer said.
Though the presentations became highly technical, guests appreciated the curators’ depth of detail. “It was unexpectedly succinct, diverse, [and] informative,” attendee Mark L. Hanin said after the presentations. “They discussed technology that might have been dry. It was a pleasant surprise to hear curators discuss what concerns them without toning it down for the general public.”
The third pair of presenters—Martinez and Amy Brauer, the Diane Heath Beever Curator of the Collection, Division of Asian and Mediterranean Art—focused on the Museums’ potential to have a greater impact in the lives of the Harvard community.
“We’re going to have three study centers in the renovated building where students and members of the public can come and have intimate, profound encounters with original works of art,” Martinez said. “It’s going to be a really dynamic space and afford all kinds of opportunities for students.”
The importance of creating a new facility that lends itself to teaching has been significant in the planning of the museum, Martinez said. She hopes students will be involved with the Museums to a greater extent through the new study spaces as well as through curricular galleries and other connections with students’ academics. “The skills students can learn and share through the experience of seeing and learning what’s involved with visualizing or even spatializing an argument and seeing how different that is from writing a paper are extraordinary,” Martinez said.
“Museums, when they’re successful, actually make visitors see their world differently. They reveal entire worlds and have the power to call into question our assumptions about what we see and what we know,” she said.

How We Chose to End The World
Oct. 19-20  7:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m.
Agassiz Theater
Directed by Adriana I.  Colón ’12,
Produced by Rachel V. Byrd ’13
and Kathleen S. O’Beirne ‘15
“This is a site-specific piece,” says director-actress Adriana I. Colón ’12 as she opens the door to the downstairs basement in Agassiz House. “As a sensory thing, the audience will walk in here and feel underground.” The surprising set location for “How We Chose to End the World”—Colón’s senior thesis for her self-designed concentration of performance and the body—corresponds to a similarly unorthodox play.
Past Harvard productions that claimed to build in more audience interaction have nonetheless taken place in a single enclosed room, where the separation of stage from seats was still present. Audience-actor engagement, while implicit in these other productions, is central to Colón’s piece.  “I’m less interested in theater as story-driven. I believe that theater is an experience of community, which is why I prefer smaller audiences,” she says. Colón has dispensed with formal script-writing altogether in her planning of the show, so even though the play does have a rough plot, the details will depend largely on the spectators and how they react to various events. Colón’s audience, at most 20 people to a show, will be obligated to don white coveralls and be guided by actors through a series of stops in the basement. The tour ranges from a white “Sanitation Center” to the “Green Room,” a long chamber where blacklights illuminate a hanging ceiling of plants and a floor strewn with dirt.
In the meantime, there will be an intro meeting of “the Harvard College Survivalists”—whose byword is “Survivitas.” Audience members, between being asked uncomfortable questions by the Survivitas secretary (Carmen A. Tracy ’15), intimidated by the vicious club VP (Eli E. Kahn ’13), and smiled upon by the useless figurehead President (Arleen B. Aguasvivas ’15), will learn of the club’s purpose and its comp process. At some point, the audience will begin being the real contributors to the performance.  “You really get to break through the fourth wall,” says Aguasvivas, referring to the “wall” between actors and the spectator in drama.
Ultimately, the aim of the production is to lead the audience to a point where they have to make a decision that will influence the outcome of the play. “For whatever reason, people think about the end of the world a lot, and this particular show engages with it in a way that is both irreverent and serious,” says Kahn. “The audience will be moved to consider what it means for the world to end… but also what it means to live in civilization.”

Natasha Khan has always had an eccentric streak. Khan—better known by her stage name Bat for Lashes—spent her last album exploring fables with an alter ego named Pearl, and she always seems to be sporting some kind of striking face paint at public appearances. Khan appears stark naked on the album cover of her most recent album, “The Haunted Man,” and at first glance this feels like yet more gimmickry from the indie songstress. However, upon first listen, it’s clear that she’s actually easing up on the gimmicks. Her new album shows her stripping her atmospheric-yet-accessible sound to its essence and revealing a barer, more intimate identity. The final product is at once her most pop and her most personal, a disc that infects with danceable, if sometimes repetitive rhythms and striking sincerity.
The most infectious beat on the album belongs to “Oh Yeah,” which begins with a chorus of digital voices and then plunges into metronomic hip-hop, punctuated by accordion-like synths. The production is certainly not stripped-down by Bat for Lashes’ old standards, as whirling pianos and twangy synth interjections weave around Khan’s vibrant vocals. But Khan leaves plenty of room for the track to breathe through the hollowed-out drum beat—its repetitive nature is pleasingly minimalistic and almost hypnotic.
Khan isn’t satisfied with an album of arty club bangers, though. “Lilies” opens the album with gliding vocals and dreamy guitar strumming but becomes much more complex as each layer of sound is introduced. It’s here that we see Khan at her most adventurous and eccentric—sometimes the beat is just bass and snare and sometimes it disappears completely. When the chorus bursts out of thin air, the beat becomes a powerhouse, bolstered by a fat, buzzing bass. It’s a headphone user’s paradise, and the schizophrenic, textural production evokes Björk. But Khan is not merely regurgitating influences; the personal themes on “The Haunted Man” make the music uniquely her own.
“Laura,” the album’s first single, is also its strongest track—it’s an exercise in tasteful arrangement through which Khan pours her own feelings. Somber piano chords are joined by Khan’s delicate crooning: “You say that they’ve all left you behind / Your heart broke when the party died.” When warm brass is eased into the mix, the mood turns inspirational, as Khan reassures the titular Laura that she’s “more than a superstar.” The song was written for a real friend of Khan’s, and the honesty shows through. Even when the music builds triumphantly, it’s a fragile triumph—Khan wisely eschews what could have become symphonic bombast by accenting her climax with a modest trumpet and cello. On “Laura,” it’s clear throughout that Khan is simply speaking to a friend in need.
Because so much of the music crackles with emotional energy, the few one-track-minded dance numbers feel comparatively shallow. “A Wall” is undoubtedly danceable with its repetitive, bouncy groove, but it doesn’t offer much that the rest of the album lacks save some slightly unnerving lyrics. Likewise, “Rest Your Head” is a fun number with a catchy synthesizer hook, but it just feels flat after the emotional dynamo that is the first half. There’s not a bad track on the album, but the simply good songs just sound like filler by comparison.
“You thought I wouldn’t know your face,” sings Khan to the titular “Deep Sea Diver” of the album’s closer. On “The Haunted Man,” it’s Khan herself who looks different. While she’s still enthusiastically experimenting with textures, beats, and moods, there’s less flash and more personality. This may be the third Bat for Lashes release, but it might as well be the end of that moniker; Natasha Khan seems to no longer need a stage name to hide behind. Ultimately, though, it’s all about the music, and whatever she goes by, she certainly has that covered.

Pete Townshend, the guitarist and principal songwriter for the Who, interrupted his moderator almost immediately after sitting down for a discussion at the Berklee Performance Center on Friday. “I was going to try and do a Robbie Williams,” he said, prompting expectant cheers. He readied his hand, tossed and flipped the mic a few inches in the air, and caught it—backwards.
Though he joked and told anecdotes—being surrounded by half-naked women at an early concert of his  professional saxophonist father, for instance, while he, eight years old, sipped on a vanilla milkshake—Townshend set a more serious tone for the evening. For much of the discussion, which was tied to the release of his new memoir “Who I Am” and followed by a short acoustic performance, he delved into his upbringing in postwar London and how it influenced his lyricism and music.
Townshend explained that his first book deal, offered to him decades ago, had not gone as successfully as the publication of “Who I Am.” Much to his original editor’s disappointment, he said, the book didn’t have enough sex, drugs, or rock and roll. Instead, he said, the work was an examination of the way music changed between his and his father’s generations.
Although his new book includes drug and rock and roll stories, themes of the cross-generational change in music still arise. “When I sat to write, I wanted to write a book that’s true,” he said of “Who I Am.” Townshend described the music when his father was still performing, during and after World War II, as beautiful and smooth; it exemplified a postwar romanticism and the promise of a fruitful future, he said. But after experiencing the postwar syndrome two times—as a young child after World War II and as an adult after the Vietnam War—and living during the Vietnam conflict, Townshend said, his music and that of his generation dealt with surviving and the threat of nuclear warfare.
He detailed how his upbringing and personal life in that era became an important influence on his lyricism. The experiences he recounted—finding human bones while playing in bombed buildings as a kid, being sent off to live with a mentally unstable grandmother, watching friends fall into drug addictions—were, he said, what made him realize the Who’s music could be more meaningful than just rhyming tunes. “[The band members] allowed our vulnerability to come forward,” he said.
Furthermore, he continued, growing up in this period led him to string a running narrative throughout his music: the story of the boy out in the crowd, lost amid postwar life, who represented boys and girls in West London who had been changed by the times. “You weren’t asked to do anything—just to shut up,” Townshend said. Since many aspects of society were being computerized and there was no need for young people to join the military, Townshend said, the young people of the time felt they lacked purpose.
But Townshend also explained other famous lyrics less tied to England’s socio-political ills. After a journalist—who was also a big pinball fan—told the band he did not care for an early score of the Who’s 1969 rock opera “Tommy,” the band made the titular character a “pinball wizard” to curry the critic’s favor, Townshend said. The choice spawned the record’s most famous song.
More broadly, Townshend said, songwriting did not all come from within—the response of the Who’s audiences shaped the sentiments he aimed to get across.
From his unique position on stage, he said, he took note on how girls and boys interacted—when fights broke out, how people danced, and how young couples behaved—which he felt reflected how people relate to one another outside of a concert setting. This, in addition to their responses to the band’s songs, helped Townshend understand what emotions people wanted to find in his lyrics.
After the discussion, Townshend walked to a chair illuminated on stage and lifted an acoustic guitar from its stand. As he tuned and noodled around, the audience began shouting song suggestions. “I’m not taking, what do you call it—requests,” Townshend responded.
He opened with a short, upbeat, lyric-less composition he said was new, then moved into four Who favorites: “Drowned,” “The Acid Queen,” “I’m One,” and “Won’t Get Fooled Again.” Far from dancing and fighting, the crowd just bobbed their heads to Townshend’s powerful chords. Once finished, the musician simply put his guitar down, thanked his audience, and walked off the stage.

When walking down Church Street, people rarely look above street-level. If one did stop and allow his or her gaze to wander for a moment, they might spot an artist. Separated from the honks and cries of cars and pedestrians by a pane of glass, tailor Joe Calautti can often be found deeply entrenched in his work, creating heirloom-quality clothing from scratch.
Looking out from their store windows, Boston’s few remaining traditional tailors —including Joe Calautti, Christos Soillis, Jack Papazian, and the Kopellas family —have watched people shed tradition and old styles along with their formal dress. In the 50s and 60s, any young American man would wear, at minimum, a shirt and tie, likely with a jacket and hat. Watching any film from the 60s, one can see that the default of dress was set a bit higher than where standards rest today. However, within some small workplaces tucked away in the city, the old respect and complete understanding of clothing are kept safe and well in the hands of a few talented artisans.
SUITS FAUST
For those who are nostalgic for the time of the everyday jacket and tie, walking into Rizzo Tailor at 66 Church Street is a something of a holy experience. The fitting area is covered in jackets and suits that are at various stages in the bespoke’s process; each garment is handmade for an individual customer. Books upon books of fabric samples line the window overlooking Church Street. Swaths of fabric are spread out over an aged wooden table covered with thousands of pockmarks from a needle piercing cloth and indented where a hot iron sat for years. A glance to the left reveals the heart and soul of the shop, the workshop itself. Spools of thread line the walls, half- and quarter-finished garments hang all over, and a gorgeous, old Singer sewing machine sits beside a wide work table. It is in this room that Calautti demonstrates his skill time and time again, outfitting the likes of Senator John Kerry, President Drew Faust, and more than a few other Harvard professors.
Calautti has been working at Rizzo for 46 years, and he is the current owner of the business. When it comes to the world of tailoring, he is the genuine article, born and raised in Italy, one of the capitols of the art. “I was eight when I started going to the tailor’s shops. We were the little guys watching the big guys and learning what they were doing,” Calautti says. He demonstrates how the older tailors used thread to tie the boys’ middle finger in a certain position to make it flexible and quick enough to properly work a needle.
There is a real romance in the way Calautti talks about his pieces of custom work. Each suit is introduced as a reflection of the person who ordered it, and I learn as much from Calautti about the fabric as I do the customer who chose it. He looks at a cashmere sportcoat and launches into a detailed account of each small aspect of the jacket, “You see this wide lapel? And how many jackets do you see these days with a peak lapel? And the slash pockets,” Calautti says. “I do all this because this is how the gentleman likes it.” Calautti delights in sharing the stories behind every garment hanging in his shop, and not once does he need to stop to check a tag to know which item belongs to whom.
Calautti’s enthusiasm for his work is apparent from moment he greets each customer. A jovial, middle-aged Italian man in a crisply pressed shirt, he is as eager to hear about his customers’ day as he is to hear about their clothing needs. He wears a small black workbelt, filled with needles, pins, and other tools of the trade, which he uses to deftly pin and adjust fabric as he explains his vision for the garment to his customers.
HANDY WORK
Calautti’s workshop still does all of its work by hand. Calautti executes most of the custom work entirely by himself, investing between six to seven months to create a custom suit. Rizzo Tailor’s process presents a stark contrast to the new changes in tailoring brought by advanced technology. Many online made-to-measure services have sprung up in the past few years, including Indochino, which started in 2007. Most of these work by simply plugging values into an algorithmic, mechanized operation. These services offer a degree of customization in suiting at a fraction of the price of a true bespoke item, but the difference in price is not without a difference in quality.
The key technical distinction between made-to-measure and bespoke tailoring is that made-to-measure services use a customer’s measurements to adjust an existing pattern, altering small details such as sleeve length or waist size, while a true custom tailor will cut an entirely new pattern for each customer. Most made-to-measure services will still produce machine-made clothing, while custom tailors such as Calautti work almost exclusively by hand. Details such as hand stitching in the lapel of a jacket create an irreplaceable, rounded quality, and the overall drape of a handcrafted garment will almost always surpass that of a machine-made piece.
Unhurried by production schedules or assembly lines, Calautti works over a long process with a first and second fitting, creating a garment that bears his handiwork like a proud signature. Each of Calautti’s items is created to the specifications and unique silhouette of an individual customer. In this sense they are unequivocally the customer’s, but every stitch and feature of the item carries Calautti’s talent and philosophy. He gives intense attention and uses a finesse born of years of practice to something as simple as attaching a button to a jacket, making sure that the stitches are all the precise tension and the shank, a device for providing enough space in between a garment and a button, is done properly to preserve the drape and integrity of the fabric. “To learn this trade, it’s an art. You have to know everything,” Calautti says. “To say you’re a professional tailor you have to know from A to Z. Otherwise I could never call myself a professional tailor.”
VISION TO VESTMENT
Discussing clothing with a tailor and with a salesman are fundamentally different experiences. A customer’s interaction with a salesman is limited to an hour, maybe less. A salesperson sells a finished product to the customer, usually one made by a third party. When the customer has paid for an item, his or her relationship with the salesperson ends. Many tailors, on the other hand, maintain clients over decades and through multiple generations. What they sell is trust and an ongoing relationship. “We’ve been here since 1974, and we have some third generation customers now,” says Bill Kopellas, son of Frank Kopellas of Frank’s Custom Tailoring. “We build relationships with the customers.”
A tailor’s relationship with a customer is built over years of service and communication, dressing their clients for some of the most important events of their lives, such as weddings and graduations. Jack Papazian of Jack’s Tailoring in Porter Square has worked at his shop since 1986, and his family has in the tailoring business for over 65 years. “I’m a good listener. The first thing I do is simply listen to a customer to try to learn their psychology and how they like their clothes,” he says. “Then I explain everything to them, A to Z, to make sure they understand exactly what I am thinking.” A tailor must have all the communicative skills of a salesperson, but also the fine skills of an artist. He must listen to the desires and vision of a customer, and then translate those ideas with a needle and thread into a piece of clothing.
Maintaining their shop’s reputation rests squarely on the shoulders of the tailors themselves. Papazian works completely by himself, doing all of the alterations in his shop with his own hands. “I’m a one-man operation; I don’t trust this work to anyone else. Anytime I don’t see the nicest work on a finished job, I can know exactly what I did, and I know how I can fix it to make my customer happy,” Papazian says. “At the end, it is me facing the client. It is my reputation.” After a customer leaves the tailor’s with a suit, any opinion of the garment is also a judgment of the craftsman behind it.
GRECIAN SHOES
What comes with each of these master craftsmen is a long history and tradition. None of these tailors attended a four-year school or training course to learn their craft; they have spent their lives mastering their profession. Many of them were sent off at an age between 8 and 12 to apprentice with an experienced professional in the trade.
Calautti and Papazian come from families that have worked in tailoring for generation. But for Christos Soillis of Felix’s Shoe Repair, his initiation into tailoring was less than straightforward. Soillis has been working with shoes since he was 11 years old, when he left his natal village to find work. In another town, Soillis was looking for a place to sleep when he found two neighboring buildings, one for a cobbler and one for a tailor. He knocked on the first door and asked if he could simply sleep in the doorway, but the owner insisted he must come in and stay with his family. Soillis stayed with them, and felt obligated to work in return for the family’s hospitality, even though his initial desire was not to be a shoemaker. “When I was a boy, I always dreamed of being a tailor,” he says. “I never had good clothes, so I thought I could make suits and have nice clothes.” His host offered to find him work at the tailor’s next door, but the young Soillis refused, saying he would rather work in his host’s shoe store. Soillis’s story is present in every bit of work and skill he invests in a pair of shoes. For Soillis, tailoring is more than a paycheck; it is a way of life and an art form to be honored.
Many of these artisans have been in the Cambridge-Boston area for decades, becoming integral parts of the communities. Soillis came to the United States in 1963, and began working in the original Felix’s Shoe Repair in Harvard Square. In 1969, he bought the business from its original owner, and he has owned and operated the business in Harvard Square to this day. “I grew up without shoes or good clothes, and I came here with nothing. And a kid with no money, no education, can come here and grow a business and support a family. This doesn’t come from me, this comes from my customers, who come in and support me because they can see that I am working as hard as I can,” Soillis says. “I love the square.” Soillis’s loyalty extends beyond his customers to the community itself.
SOULFUL STITCH
Visiting a tailor is completely different from stepping into a big department store. The most immediate difference is the space itself. Visiting a conventional clothing store, what one sees are racks and racks of clothing in shiny, organized displays. If any alterations need to be done, the clothes are whisked off to some man or machine behind a curtain. Walking into Rizzo or Felix’s Shoe Repair, one never feels any distance from the true soul of the operation. There is no mystery about where the work is done; the work is what is being displayed. In Felix’s Shoe Repair, customers will often watch Christos Soillis working on a handbag or shoes. His workspace is in the very fore of his shop, as his handiwork is the very essence of his trade.
What Soillis does is not particularly lucrative, and he knows this. Sometimes, he will spend more than an hour on a simple shoe repair to ensure that it is done properly. “The money you make ends up being less than a dishwasher would make, but if you love what you do, money is the last thing you worry about,” Soillis says. “I feel like the luckiest man in the world.” The joy Soillis derives from helping his customers exceeds any money woes.
NO MASK
These men are not working to meet deadlines or financial goals; their primary concern is the quality of their work. “I’m not a salesman, I’m not a designer. I’m a tailor. When I work, I want to please myself first, then the customer,” Calautti says. “If I see in their eyes that they don’t like the work, or I don’t like it, I’ll rip it up and do it again.” He views each garment with an artist’s eye, and if it does not meet his standards, even if it might meet someone else’s, that is not good enough.
There is no mask or diffusion of responsibility; a jacket from Frank Kopellas speaks of Kopellas himself. The workmanship of one of Calautti’s suits is nobody’s but his own. Every stitch in a shoe resoled by Soillis testifies to his work ethic. A blazer recut by Papazian gains new life through his hands.
Tailors put forth this level of care and personal attention not only to earn their customers’ loyalty but also to protect their integrity of their art. The item leaves their shop carrying their handiwork, present in every small stitch or alteration. Madelan Kopellas recounts what her father, Frank, always says to his customers, “You have to look good when you walk out my door. That’s my name your wearing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Who cares about innovation? Certainly not Ty Segall, if his latest album, “Twins,” is any indication. The swift 35-minute project starts and ends with a heavy dose of feedback and is filled in between with blaring garage rock that has the sound quality of an ’80s cassette tape. There is nothing original about the whiny guitars and furious cymbal crashes, but the talented Segall makes up for it with raw energy and simple, infectious songwriting. In the haze of every vaguely familiar riff and harmonized melody, there is little that sticks in the mind afterwards, but it’s sure as hell fun while it’s on.
“Twins” is the third album this year from the hard working Segall—he put out a collaborative album with White Fence in April and another one with his touring band in June. While other artists use their many side projects to experiment with instrumentation and songwriting, Segall has stuck to his guns: verse-chorus-verse earworms with distorted guitar riffs inserted at every possible opportunity. He wastes no time asserting his formula with “Twins’” opener, “Thank God for Sinners.” “I’m out on the streets, you know / I’m looking for you,” he drawls, and a clumsy drum fill launches him into the heavy groove. Thirty-five seconds into the album, we already have a huge, reverberating chorus; twenty seconds after that, we have our first dueling guitar solo. It’s all a little laughable, but also absurdly catchy.
Throughout the album, Segall continues to reaffirm his penchant for a garage-rock style that is low on substance but high on volume and enthusiasm. “You’re the Doctor” is a three-chord bruiser that crashes along at a furious tempo. Segall couldn’t be bothered to write a different melody for the verse and the chorus, so they’re exactly the same—on the chorus, he screams the Ramones-esque lyrics, “There’s a problem in my brain,” over and over again. On “Love Fuzz,” the eighth track, he approximates the riff from “Expecting” by the White Stripes, another modern-day garage-rock outfit. He doesn’t seem too apologetic, though, judging by the gleeful, stuttering guitar solo.
Segall isn’t a one-trick pony, though; he successfully incorporates pop elements to make the album varied. “The Hill,” the first single, begins with a chorus of female vocalists singing a dreamy harmony. Even after the squealing guitars enter, the vocalists hold their ground and provide a refreshing contrast to Segall’s hoarse shouting. Even more intriguing is “Gold On The Shore,” which can’t not be an homage to Seal’s classic “Kiss From a Rose.” The tempo and rhythmic feel are exactly the same, and sunny harmonies flow in and out above the nimble bass, just like in the original. The first few lines serve as further proof: “A kiss in the wind to my girl / This is the rose that I gave you before.” The R&B icon Seal might seem like a strange source of inspiration for a garage rocker, but at any rate, the song provides a tender moment to an otherwise bruising album and showcases Segall’s ear for melody.
Ultimately, Segall’s reliance on the ideas and styles of others before him is the album’s main weakness. There’s hardly a note on “Twins” that couldn’t have been on a lost Replacements album circa 1985. Given that there is no innovation or stylistic choice that marks the album as being from the 21st century, it’s likely that many punk and garage rock fans would rather simply return to the originals.
However, Segall doesn’t seem to care too much about how the record will fare in the future. He’s much more interested in milking every last screech out of his guitar and reveling in facing his axe to the amplifier to produce that fantastic, grating feedback that has delighted rockers in their basements for 40 years. Segall may not be trying too hard to pursue innovation on “Twins,” but there are far worse things than a talented musician having fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cellist Zoe Keating steps onto the stage of the Berklee Performance Center. The bold smile on her face doesn’t betray the stage fright she told me she would inevitably feel before stepping into the spotlight. Neither do the confident red dreads bursting from the top of her head.
Keating settles into her chair and, after cracking a few jokes, begins to work her magic. She’s more of a conductor and an orchestra together than a single musician, really; as she performs, she loops her cello parts, layering them on top of one another until she’s filled the stage—and entire concert hall—with her presence.
A self-produced composer and performer, Keating came to Boston last Thursday as part of an ambitious, multinational tour. She’s come a long way from the California redwoods she calls home, but travel isn’t foreign to her. Neither is attention. Despite starting her professional music career late and self-releasing both her albums, Keating has received press from everyone from Wired to NPR, not to mention the million and a quarter followers she has on Twitter.
Keating calls herself a shy person, but to leave it at that would be to ignore a more intriguing truth: she’s a woman of contradictions. A classically trained cellist, she graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and promptly began a career at an IT startup. “I had a liberal arts degree—a very valuable liberal arts degree,” she says, characteristic of her self-deprecating humor. “It just so happened [my graduation] coincided with the dot com boom…. That was really the savior of liberal arts grads. You could do this creative thing where you were doing a little of everything and nothing at the same time—it sort of sums up being a liberal arts grad.”
It’s typical of Keating to play down her abilities and accomplishments like they’re nothing. She explains her placement as an engineer by saying that she wasn’t cut out for her first job. “They told me I was the worst admin they’d ever had, so they made me an engineer,” she laughs. She mentions off-hand that at the same time that she was working these full-fledged startup hours, she was also spending long nights playing rock shows in her friends’ bands.
Keating’s love of music has been one constant in her life. “I think I always had some sort of musical aptitude,” she says, “[the type] that comes out in your forced recorder class,” which is exactly what happened to her. Upon noticing her talent, her music teacher asked her to try out the cello. “I don’t know why the cello, specifically,” she adds, jokingly offering her imposing height as the reason. “Sometimes I feel like she could have said, “Do you want to play the bassoon?” and I’d have said, ‘OK,’ and I’d be doing this with bassoon,” she says, gesturing at the stage behind her.
Regardless of the reason, the instrument stuck. And eventually, her signature style was born—not on the stage of one of her late night concerts, but in the living room of the 6,000-square-foot, two-floor, San Francisco warehouse she moved into. Surrounded by fellow musicians, Keating had the opportunity to innovate. “It was a really fertile environment, and there were all these doodads for me to try out and experiment with,” she says. Eventually, she premiered her first compositions there—to an audience of 200 people sprawled on beanbags.
Keating’s goal, beanbags or not, has always been to recreate the powerful connection she has with music. “I like to lie on the floor, and I put the speakers on either side of my ears, and I go to another universe. Time stops meaning anything,” she says. “I have a very visceral and physical reaction to music, and I’m trying to recreate that onstage.”
Watching Keating play is fascinating. She’s not an artist who has been whisked away by her music. She plays in tension, brow furrowed, lips tense, painstakingly building a background for herself note by note. Eventually, there’s a release: her eyes close, and she starts moving with her cello. Keating blends background rhythmic plucks and guttural, jabbing chords with dancing melodies and deep, smooth bass lines. Her songs build quickly but shift and break with equal agility, building tension and releasing into her trademark ethereal feel.
But this music isn’t the music of Keating’s warehouse days. It underwent a dramatic transformation when she was offered her big break—a last-minute opportunity to tour with Imogen Heap in 2006. In typical style, Keating accepted the offer two weeks before she was supposed to take off and set to work packing all her clunky looping equipment. She quickly realized on tour that her setup was too difficult and complicated for anything but her spacey warehouse. So she turned to what she knew well—computers. This in turn opened up new possibilities for her music. “The computer allowed me to make the looping phrases happen really fast,” she says, something she also then realized was important.
Previously, her songs were “cello odysseys:” up to 30 or more minutes of slow development. “In a warehouse with people who are in—whatever state—they’re happy for you to take 45 minutes to make a song happen.” However, the audience Heap drew was younger and less forgiving. “If I didn’t win them over in the first 60 seconds, I was done. They’d be on their cell phones texting all their friends,” she says. Ever positive, Keating took this as a creative challenge and began experiment with punchier beginnings—the sort that are now her trademark.
This adventurous spirit that has so aided Keating didn’t come to her naturally, though. “I’m a very shy person, so if I just follow my instincts I’ll go hide in a corner and I won’t meet anyone interesting,” Keating says. So she decided to change. “If someone asked me to do something, I’d just say yes without thinking about it. Not anything, obviously, but music things…. I just say yes, and figure I’ll work it out later.
It seems that Keating extends this approach beyond what opportunities she will take and to her music itself. When she performs, she improvises. She lets her music take her to places she didn’t intend and works out the next steps when she gets there. Sometimes, this means she accidentally erases entire songs halfway through performing them, but more often it means she’s able to escape the expected and take the audience with her to another place—perhaps it’s home to the foggy redwoods, or perhaps it’s somewhere that didn’t exist before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Felix Mendelssohn was the genre-defining master of Romanticism, Dmitri Shostakovich was the master of disguising acerbic expressions against the Stalinist regime—in an agreeable veil of neo-Romanticism. From October 11 to October 13, the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) presented a fascinating program that juxtaposed these two composers’ most different works: Mendelssohn’s wildly popular Violin Concerto and Shostakovich’s wildly controversial Fourth Symphony.
While Shostakovich was unusually talented at producing works that aligned both to his own artistic conviction and to the demands of Soviet nationalism, this symphony was deemed so dissonant—and thus unable to properly portray the glory of the USSR—that it could not be performed until Stalin’s death, almost 25 years after its intended premiere. The piece is still rarely performed, despite the composer himself having called it his “artistic credo.”
In dramatic contrast, Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto was met with immediate critical enthusiasm in 1845, and to this day remains one of the first concertos any violinist learns. For these concerts, the BSO had what must have been the absolute pleasure of supporting German violinist Arabella Steinbacher in her fierce yet graceful performance, which received an extended standing ovation. There were moments throughout when the eager BSO would overpower Steinbacher, no doubt in part due to the physical dynamic limitations of a violin. This minor misfortune served to make that much more impressive Steinbacher’s cadenza, which was composed of technically skillful octaves that successfully highlighted the thematic material.
Principal Bassoon Richard Svoboda had a busy program, as the bassoon parts in both of the pieces play an integral part of the orchestration. Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto was the first multi-movement piece without a pause in between: the bassoon holds the final note of the first movement into the beginning of the second. Svoboda’s timbre was ethereal and delicate for the Mendelssohn, and the popular atmosphere of the first part of the concert in no way deterred him from his vigorous performance in the second.
The BSO is still without a permanent music director since James Levine’s resignation in 2011, and we can thank Moscow-born conductor Vladimir Jurowski for bringing Shostakovich’s fourth in all its Slavic glory to Boston. Jurowski’s idiosyncratic style of conducting was particularly apt for the sprawling symphony. Though definitely retrained in form, he exerted immense artistic control over the orchestra with calculated and deliberate movements, not only with his baton but also with individual fingers. He dictated the speed and feel of even the smallest orchestral element, such as the myriad trills of the woodwind section in the second movement.
It was perhaps inevitable that there would be a mishap in a performance of such a demanding symphony. For about thirty seconds in the middle of the final movement, the violin section was noticeably off measure with the percussion section. Let the purist whine! Given how rhythmically complex the symphony is, it is incredible that it only took thirty seconds for Jurowski to bring the orchestra back on track. These thirty seconds were the only ones in which the percussionists were anything but impeccable. Shostakovich was particularly innovative in the scoring of the percussions for this symphony and the section fully honored his vision with dynamically rich and energetic execution.
Though in its second season without a full-time director, the BSO continues to present exciting repertoire befitting an orchestra of its skill and resources. The Mendelssohn and the Shostakovich were both performed with great dexterity, but it was the contrast between the two scores that made for a truly remarkable night at Symphony Hall.

Last Sunday, Venezuela re-elected President Hugo Chavez to a new six-year term by a margin of 10 points, potentially keeping his socialist agenda in place through 2018. Though challenger Henrique Capriles Radonski came closer to dethroning Chavez
than anyone had previously, 10 points still represents a gap of over one million votes. If anything, we can expect Chavez to be even bolder in this next term, as he will use his victory as a way to legitimize his “Bolivarian Revolution.”
The opposition now faces a more daunting task than ever if it wants to reach the presidency and push its own agenda. Capriles’ own campaign slogan, “Hay un Camino”—“There is a Path”—seems like nothing more than a far-off dream at this point. But the task is not impossible. If Capriles and his allies want to rebuild Venezuela their way by eliminating government inefficiency and corruption and promoting economic growth, their biggest challenge will be transforming the coalition of opposition parties into a permanent party, while still gaining support from those who voted for Chavez this election cycle.
Six years ago, Venezuela’s presidential candidates consisted of Hugo Chavez, challenger Manuel Rosales, and a myriad of other, unorganized candidates with similar policy positions to Mr. Rosales. Due to the presence of several opposition parties Chavez trounced that vote by 26 points, effectively destroying Rosales’ career. In 2012, Capriles managed to consolidate the opposition into the closest Venezuela has had to a true opposition party in years. It was no longer Chavez against everyone else, but rather Chavez against Capriles. The former governor of Miranda was able to garner such support in part because of the hope he was able to generate for Venezuela. Now that he lost by such a large margin, it will be difficult for Capriles to convince his followers that real gains were made, or that it is worth remaining in a coalition.
Capriles does, however, have one reason to celebrate: Venezuela has gubernatorial elections in December, and Capriles has already started to energize the opposition into maintaining the coalition through the elections. Capriles has also already begun his campaign to regain his old job as governor of Miranda, where he will be opposing Elias Jaura, the Vice President during Chavez’s last term. If Capriles wins, he can use these elections as a way to show the Venezuelan people that the opposition is capable of winning an election against one of Chavismo’s most recognizable faces. Victories in the gubernatorial elections, where the opposition has historically done far better than in the presidential campaigns, could make the coalition a more permanent fixture in Venezuelan politics, a crucial detail if anyone is to defeat Chavismo in the near future.
Of course, simply maintaining their position will not be enough to win over control of the nation. Seven million citizens voted for Hugo Chavez in 2012, so there are still gains that must be made. There are massive logistical issues to making inroads among voters; now out of the national spotlight and running for governor, it will be more difficult for Capriles to reach out to the public. But, just as he did in his campaign, Capriles can cite issues such as rising inflation, corruption in government, and crime rates as reasons to support his opposition party. If Capriles can get over the logistical obstacles, he may be able to improve the opposition party’s standing among the electorate, and thus increase their chances of winning a subsequent presidential election.
Capriles also must be ready to launch a presidential campaign at any moment in the next four years. If Chavez, who has battled cancer and undergone three surgeries in Cuba since June 2011, dies or is forced to leave office (for medical reasons, for instance) at any point in the next four years, the constitution dictates the Vice President has 30 days to organize a nationwide presidential election. With no heir apparent to Chavez, it would be far easier for Capriles to win the presidency up against the new Chavista candidate than if he were to run against Chavez himself again in 2018. Though Capriles has wisely wished Chavez good health and long life on the campaign trail, it is an unfortunate truth that his greatest chance at being elected president in the next decade or so lies in the death of Venezuela’s current president.
The opposition party in Venezuela was dealt a major blow last weekend. But the fact of the matter is, Capriles has managed to consolidate the opposition in a way that has not been seen since Chavez took the presidency. If Capriles can continue to lead the opposition, and make gains among those who voted for Chavez in 2012, we may just see a path for Venezuela after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As countless students around the world took the SAT a week ago, Palestinians from the West Bank could not join their ranks. The October SAT exam was cancelled for students in the West Bank: The Israeli authorities held the exams sent by the College Board for weeks, not releasing the tests to AMIDEAST’s office in Ramallah.
AMIDEAST is the only testing agency in the West Bank, serving over three hundred thousand Palestinian students. Yet Israel controls the flow of goods and people in and out of the ever-shrinking Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Israeli occupation impacts nearly every aspect of Palestinian life. In particular, the military occupation, illegal under international law, violates the basic right to education for Palestinian youth.
This SAT cancellation has been devastating for high school seniors across the West Bank who were planning to apply to college in the United States—including those from the Ramallah Friends School. As alumni of the school, we are proud of its emphasis on global citizenship. RFS has a rich history in Palestine. It was established in 1869 by American Quakers and has since been certified by the International Baccalaureate Organization in Switzerland. About half of RFS students are Palestinian Muslims and the other half are Palestinian Christians—the latter are descendants of the very first Christian community. We have been nurtured by values of peace, nonviolence, social justice, and equality—principles to which many Palestinian families are deeply committed.
Many Palestinians go on to the best universities across the United States each year, including Harvard. Recently, Harvard College admitted three individuals from RFS alone in one year. After graduating from college, many RFS graduates and their peers from other Palestinian schools return to Palestine because of the strong connection we feel to our homeland. We are eager to use the knowledge and skills we have gained abroad to help build a brighter future for the coming generations.
The College Board has announced that it will attempt to schedule a make-up test for those students who were supposed to take the October SAT. AMIDEAST suggested in an email that the tests were held because of an “administrative delay.” According to Michael Madormo, English teacher and Director of the College Preparatory Academy at RFS, “the SAT cancellation has been disheartening since it seems that the Israelis had the exams for weeks and despite efforts by UPS, ETS [Educational Testing Service], and AMIDEAST, the tests were not passed through customs.”
Palestinians have suffered from such profound lack of sovereignty for decades now. This latest SAT episode is merely a symptom of systematic attacks on Palestinian education.  During the first Intifada, Palestinian educational institutions were deemed illegal by the Israeli occupation forces, and our parents were forced to hold clandestine classrooms in churches, mosques, and private homes. During the second Intifada, RFS was directly affected by the bombing of a next door police station by the Israeli military and students were unable to attend school due to Israeli blockades and curfews. One of the authors of this article, Lena Awwad, could not attend RFS for three years due to extensive Israeli checkpoints, which prevented her from reaching school. By depriving this year’s RFS seniors the ability to take the SAT, and more broadly hurting Palestinian education, Israel is jeopardizing the academic trajectories of future leaders.
The Israeli policy of bulldozing and destroying Palestinian schools continues unabated. Israeli settlers in the West Bank harass and violently abuse Palestinian schoolchildren—and the hundreds of humiliating checkpoints, Israeli settler-only roads, and the apartheid wall significantly impede freedom of movement for Palestinians and the right to access school. Additionally, Palestinian academic institutions such as Birzeit University find it tremendously difficult to secure basic resources and supplies for their students such as books from abroad. Yet Palestinians are an incredibly resilient people. Despite the assault we face on our right to education and on our livelihoods in general, Palestinians have among the highest literacy rates in the Arab world and the region's highest doctorates per capita.
It is daunting for us to explain the struggle of our families and nation under Israeli military occupation. It is difficult for others to imagine being prevented from taking an exam or, more importantly, to imagine having one’s right to education severely impinged upon because of a foreign occupying power. Palestinian voices are missing from mainstream discourse in the U.S. because of unconditional and blind support for Israel. Many Americans are conditioned to believe that Israeli policies are justified responses to security concerns. This raises the question, then, of what the SAT has to do with Israeli security. And this begs the additional question of when the right to basic human security will be recognized for Palestinians—a people that has been defenseless and stateless for far too long.
We hope that relentless Israeli policies enforced on our peers leading to the SAT cancellation will not impede their college application processes, and look forward to welcoming yet another group of Palestinians to Harvard in the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We often think of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder as an ailment affecting soldiers returning from combat. But how is it being diagnosed and treated in other parts of the world? Zaki Djemal ’14, a former Israeli soldier, has worked in both Japan and South Sudan with IsraAID, an organization that, among other things, helps in the treatment of PTSD.
Though Japanese are suffering from PTSD after the March 11, 2011 tsunami and the South Sudanese are suffering from PTSD after 38 years of a bloody civil war, Djemal noted some surprising similarities and contradictions in the development and treatment of PTSD programs in both countries.
The March 11 earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan killed an estimated 15,870 people and came to be the most expensive natural disaster in world history, costing an estimated $235 billion in damages.
IsraAID entered Japan two days after the tsunami with a medical team to help with the relief effort. The team faced initial resistance from Japanese doctors, but after many negotiations, the community centers allowed IsraAID to conduct some programs with kids who lost homes and family members in the tsunami.
“We took a large piece of white paper and divided it into four categories,” Djemal explained. “The categories were ‘tsunami,’ ‘hope,’ ‘home,’ and ‘happiness,’ and the kids were asked to draw pictures of what came to mind.” They etched out the word “tsunami” with dark markers. Under “home,” they drew their homes being swept away. Under “hope,” they drew the zecora cherry tree. Under “happiness,” they drew their homes as they were. It had been two weeks since the tsunami, but it was the very first time the kids were addressing what had happened.
After this initial discovery that the trauma hadn’t been addressed, IsraAID started working in eight different municipalities all over Japan, training government officials, teachers, and aid workers in PTSD treatment.
So how can it be that this small organization from Israel is able to help a country that has the third largest economy in the world?
Djemal explains, “Once you cross that visible line between outside and insider, the teachers wanted to learn how to do it. Also, the same social norms and protocol of the country don’t apply to us outsiders. So we had a comparative advantage in that sense.”
IsraAID plans on staying in Japan to continue training officials and teachers in PTSD treatment until the end of 2013.
This past summer, Djemal travelled to South Sudan with IsraAID. South Sudan became a country on July 9, 2011. The country has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world and more than a quarter of the 8 million South Sudanese don’t have enough food to survive.
IsraAID entered South Sudan two weeks after its independence, and four months later it launched its first program focused on helping South Sudanese tackle posttraumatic stress disorder caused by the civil war, working specifically with cases of gender-based violence. GBV is prevalent not only because of the civil war, but also because polygamy, wife-beating, and forced marriages are still common cultural practices that undermine the rights of women and girls in the country. Lack of awareness about GBV, coupled with a lack of resources and trained personnel, limit the numbers of women and girls that can be properly and effectively treated for PTSD.
The organization sent a team of trained mental health practitioners and social workers to the new country to begin training for organizations and the government on how to cope with PTSD and GBV.
The organization has a five-pronged approach to tackling PTSD in South Sudan: capacity building, community centers, advocacy, female empowerment, and livelihood activities. IsraAID is now training the country’s first social workers.
So how does PTSD treatment compare in both countries? “Japan was a lot more resistant to PTSD treatment initially—PTSD was more of a taboo. In South Sudan, everyone is more receptive,” Djemal notes. “We are comparing one of the most developed countries in the world to one of the least: South Sudan has no basic infrastructure. Yet in Japan, it was harder for us to make a case for PTSD treatment because the Japanese had more ‘established’ systems and less initial reason or want for outside help.”
Djemal stresses that a big part of treatment of PTSD is early detection. “Because it is something so prevalent in Israel, it is something we are in tuned to,” he explains.  “PTSD is experienced not just from soldiers but also a civilian setting. Dealing with civilian PTSD has developed into a skill-set in Israel…it is our responsibility to share our findings and programs with others.”

To a popular audience, the Nobel Prize in Literature comes perhaps second only to the Peace Prize itself in a ranking of prestige bestowed by the awards. Hence, last week’s decision by the Nobel Committee to award the Literature accolade to the Chinese author Mo Yan (Guan Moye) is a momentous event. Mo Yan will take his place as one of the few non-Europeans to receive this well-deserved honor. For this, he merits congratulation. His work imparts a mastery of hallucinatory realism that brings Chinese folklore and history to life, qualities for which he has won critical acclaim at home and abroad. In an age when such praise remains still largely reserved for Western work and is rarely divorced from political and social commentary, we hope that this award will be a sign of the Nobel Committee’s intent to recognize authors on the merits of their work, regardless of their politics or locale.
Others, clearly, do not agree. Chinese artist and prominent dissident activist Ai Weiwei said that awarding the Nobel Prize to Mo Yan is an “insult to humanity and to literature,” a remark presumably made in reference to the latter’s alleged ties to China’s authoritarian regime. While this criticism of a laureate’s political behavior and affiliations may be valid, the denouncement of Mo Yan’s award is not.  When establishing the Nobel Prize in Literature, Alfred Nobel wrote in his will that the prize should recognize any author who has produced “in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.” The ideal direction in turn for judging art is not a political one, but instead a decision based on aesthetic and technical grounds. As much as possible, politics should be divorced from the recognition of good literature.
Furthermore, although he was long a member of the People’s Liberation Army’s artistic section, Mo Yan is by no means a voice of the state. Ai Weiwei declared that Mo Yan is an artist who “will always stand on the side of power,” but in the wake of receiving this prize, Mo Yan has said that he hopes that the Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiabao will “gain freedom as early as possible.”
The greater problem behind awarding the Literature Prize to Mo Yan lies in the situation of this laureate in a tradition of Nobel awards that have, frankly, become overly politicized. As much as Mo Yan may have received his award because the judging committee truly considered his creative talent alone, the same generally cannot be said of all Nobel awards, particularly the Peace Prize, which often recognizes rights activists around the world. While this itself may be an honorable endeavor, it is difficult generally to think of the Nobel Prizes as apolitical, and this year’s Literature Prize will likely prove no exception to this common refrain.
Great writing forces us to be empathetic. But great writing is best sought by reserving acclaim for aesthetic and technical skill, not political messaging. In awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature to Mo Yan, the Nobel Committee has recognized a deserving artist and has given the world a chance to engage closely with nuanced and intricate tales that knit together Chinese history with personal experience. We hope that future prizes will similarly focus on artistic talent and highlight more unique perspectives from all over the world.

An outside firm will be hired to expedite the process of selecting a new city manager to replace Cambridge’s longtime head government employee, Cambridge City Councillor and Chair of the Government Operations Committee David P. Maher said on Monday.
Other councillors expressed chagrin at the slow movement of the selection process in recent months.
“This is too important for us to be able to manage ourselves. We need help from a nationally recognized company,” Maher said.
The process of selecting a new city manager is a task that none of the current city councillors have taken on before, since current manager Robert W. Healy has held the job for more than 30 years.
“Everything about the operation of the city has to do with the capacity of the city manager and the staffer and the boards he appoints to carry out the policy of the City Council,” said Francis H. Duehay ’55, a former Cambridge mayor who was on the council the last time Cambridge had to select a manager.
Since Healy announced in March that he planned to retire, the Council has convened for two meetings, in June and in September, to discuss the selection process.
At the meetings, the Council decided to pursue a “visioning exercise first, wait for the results, and then do the search,” Maher said.
As part of its “visioning exercise,” the Council will welcome input from community members in an effort to “develop a vision of what we are looking to have the city look like a few years from now.”
“My hope is that we would have a more delineated roadmap in November,” Maher said.
Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that he is disappointed by the slow progress.
“It’s been a long time, and we’ve had two meetings. Two meetings about this!” Kelley said.
Kelley also noted that both of the meetings were convened at 10 a.m. on a workday, making it difficult for any members of the working public to attend.
“Hiring a manager isn’t a small decision. With such an important decision, why is it that so little seems to be happening?” Kelley said to a Crimson reporter on Monday. “If your story has as little detail to it as the process has so far, it will be a very short story.”
Mayor Henrietta J. Davis said she is not worried about the speed of the process.
“The most important thing is to have a good process. We have plenty of time,” Davis said.
Though the Council created a 15-month transition period that some found unnecessarily long, Maher said that it actually seems unlikely that the city will complete the selection process by the time Healy’s contract expires on June 30, 2013.
“The odds are that we will not have it all finished. It may lend itself that we may be looking at an interim appointment,” Maher said.
Davis noted that frequently in choosing a school superintendent, the city has appointed an interim superintendent for a year.
“There’s been a year of an acting person and sometimes that’s even a good thing,” she said.
Healy himself initially served as acting city manager from July to December 1981 before formally taking on the position.
The third meeting of Cambridge Government Operations Committee—which is comprised of all nine city councillors—regarding the selection of the manager will be held in the coming weeks to discuss hiring a firm. This Friday’s meeting of the committee will not include this topic.

UPDATED: Oct. 17, 2012, at 12:25 a.m.
For Philip Lee, a doctoral student at Harvard Graduate School of Education, the idea that his views are important is a current that runs through his work. “I want to show people that student voice matters,” Lee said.
Lee and fellow doctoral student Matthew P. Shaw put that belief into practice in August by filing an amicus brief with the United States Supreme Court in the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. Lee and Shaw, both former attorneys, argued that the race-conscious admissions policy of the University of Texas does not unfairly discriminate against white applicants.
The case deals with a suit filed by Abigail N. Fisher, a white woman, after she was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin. Fisher alleges that her rejection was a result of her race.
Lee and Shaw wrote the amicus brief on behalf of Harvard University Graduate School of Education Students for Diversity, of which they are co-chairs. Amicus briefs have also been filed by the University and by Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow, but Lee and Shaw say they make a key argument which differentiates their brief from the others.
They argue that the policies that took shape as the civil rights movement gained ground in the 1960s are fundamentally different from previous policies meant to exclude unwanted groups, such as Harvard’s policy of Jewish exclusion under University President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877.
“Admissions offices incorporated diversity as an aspect of educational excellence—something that improves the discussion in the classroom, something that improves educational outcomes,” Lee said. He said these values still hold true today. “The University of Texas admissions model is based on the inclusionary model of the sixties, not of the twenties. And I don’t think that point was addressed earlier.”
Lee said that these inclusionary practices need to stay in place. “In terms of minority enrollment, if we move to color-blind policies, I would say the effect would be devastating,” he said.
During an event at the Ed School on Monday, Law School professors Tomiko Brown-Nagin and Lani Guinier ’71, who also jointly submitted an amicus brief on behalf of the non-profit Advancement Project, discussed the historical context of the case.
Guinier discussed the long history of exclusionary practices and hostility towards minority students at the University of Texas, which honored its former professor William Stewart Simkins, one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan in Florida, by using his name for a dormitory until 2010. “Racism is embedded in its landscape,” she said.
Guinier said that the holistic admissions policy used by the University of Texas seeks to address these past injustices toward blacks and other minorities. “[The University of Texas] can’t change the history, but it can do something about the present,” she said.
Guinier and Brown-Nagin said that the court case is just a small part of broader conversations that need to take place about race in universities in the 21st century.
Brown-Nagin said that while universities are focused on the students they admit, they ought to be asking themselves how they are preparing these students while they are enrolled to be future leaders.
“Affirmative action in higher education is really a long way away from equity in higher education,” she said.

Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” attracts 722 students to Sanders Theater. But although it is among the largest courses at Harvard, its online equivalent, Computer Science 50x, has drawn more than 100 times that number of students.
CS50x is one of two free courses offered by Harvard through edX, a joint nonprofit virtual learning initiative created last spring by Harvard and MIT.
The two courses offered by Harvard, which went live on Monday, are among the seven available from Harvard, MIT, and the University of California, Berkely in edX’s inaugural semester. Aside from CS50x, Harvard is offering Public Health 207x: “Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical & Public Health Research.”
E. Francis Cook, one of the professors leading Public Health 207x, described the number of enrollees—which has topped 30,000 so far—as “astounding.”
“This is the biggest course in public health ever offered in the world,” he said.
EdX President Anant Agarwal, an MIT professor, said that number is likely to grow even more, as students often register for online classes once the course materials have already been made available. Assignments in CS50x are due at the end of the course, allowing students to join as late as April, the same month that the course finishes.
The number of students who successfully complete the course could also be far lower than the number of students who enroll. Data from other online courses suggest that only 10 to 15 percent of enrollees complete the full requirements, according to Agarwal.
Harvard and MIT announced the creation of edX in May, hailing it as a groundbreaking endeavor to bring free academic courses to the masses. Each university invested $30 million in the project and invited other institutions to utilize the platform. University of California, Berkeley joined edX in late July, and the addition of the University of Texas was announced Monday.
MIT offered its own version of the edX platform prior to the creation of the joint venture. Approximately 160,000 students enrolled in its initial online course “Circuits & Electronics” this past spring.
Agarwal said that he anticipates that edX will unveil more than a dozen new offerings for the spring term in the next two weeks.
In anticipation of the first day of Harvard classes, Agarwal said he had his fingers crossed.
“We’re all in unchartered territory,” he said. “EdX team members, Berkeley, Harvard, and MIT faculty and students—everybody is working nights and weekends to get everything to work.”

For three years running, Science Center C has been packed with crowds clamoring to attend the popular public lecture series associated with Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science.” Monday night was no different, when veteran guest and James Beard Award-winning chef José Andrés returned to deliver a talk which pushed the audience to think critically about food and “find the truth behind things that you learn.”
The lecture, bookended by quotations from early 19th century French food writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, returned repeatedly to the theme of the power of food to create change and solve problems. Andrés drew on examples from the invention of canning to the social role of food in protest to emphasize developments in food technology that have reverberated throughout history.
In between video presentations of clementine sorbet and caramelized olive oil inspired by the glass sculptures of artist Dale Chihuly, Andrés fed the crowd humorous tidbits.
Displaying the use of liquid nitrogen to make almond cups with blue cheese foam, he quipped, “Come on, that’s what I do for breakfast every day.”
Applied mathematics professor Michael P. Brenner, who runs the course, said, “José is amazing. What amazes me the most is that his scientific explanations are always spot-on, and yet he does it in a way that everyone can understand.”
Andrés has long been associated with SPU 27. In its first year, he came to lecture four times.
The series, which also features lectures from White House pastry chef William Yosses and Andrés’ friend Ferran Adrià of the famous restaurant elBulli, continues each Monday until Dec. 3.
“It’s quite comprehensive. It’s great that this exists and is free,” said Kristie Thayer, a local cooking teacher.
Gary Fong, another audience member, said, “I’m a foodie. I have his cooking books, his travel DVDs. I think it’s a great forum for members of the public to understand celebrity chefs and cooking.”
Andrés stressed the importance of critically examining technology—of asking “what else can we do with this?”—in order to come up with innovative and sustainable solutions to problems like chronic food insecurity and hunger, an issue which is the focus of his organization World Central Kitchen.
“Sometimes imagination only requires not being afraid to be wrong,” he said.

The most expensive U.S. Senate race in the country appeared even more costly Monday when U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren announced that they had raised $7.45 million and $12.1 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2012.
The totals from July, August, and September bring the candidates’ combined total for the race to more than $60 million. Warren, who has been the best-financed Congressional candidate in the country this year, has now raised a total of more than $36 million. Brown has raised a more modest $27.4 million, but he started the race with $7 million left over from his 2010 special election run for the Senate. Both campaigns have received millions of dollars from out-of-state donors.
The high fundraising totals and out of state donors point to the race’s national prominence this election year. The Bay State seat is seen as a crucial battleground in the fight for control of the U.S. Senate.
But with Election Day only three weeks away, political strategists say the campaigns’ fundraising success in the past has lessened the potency of money as the race winds down.
“The amount of money [Warren] raised in the last quarter is astounding, but what is also amazing is how little the money can buy these candidates in the last three weeks,” said Republican political consultant Todd Domke. “There’s only so much TV or radio time they can buy.”
As cash declines in significance, the presidential race has unexpectedly risen in importance, Domke said. Though Obama is still expected to win Massachusetts in a landslide, former Mass. Governor Mitt Romney’s strengthening poll numbers have raised new questions about Obama’s prospective margin of victory in the Commonwealth. If that margin narrows, Brown will likely pick up the former Obama supporters and may have enough to support to upset the Democratic Warren, Domke said.
“It comes down to this external factor. And partly that’s because Warren’s [campaign] is much more invested in riding Obama’s coattails than winning on her own,” he said.
Democratic political strategist Mary Anne Marsh said that the breakdown of donation numbers—which have only been released in summarized form—provides important insight into the campaigns’ respective supporters.
“Fundraising is the truest measure of support before the votes are cast,” she said. “It tells you who really supports a candidate...especially in a close race in the home stretch,” Marsh wrote in an email to The Crimson. She could not be reached by phone.
Brown’s campaign said 60 percent of his donations came from within Massachusetts. Warren’s campaign said that 53,000 Massachusetts donors have contributed and 80 percent of the camp’s donations were $50 or less.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 17, 2012, at 12:02 a.m.
One of the first things that Emily D. Mancuso ’09 remembers about her experience with True Love Revolution is the heart-shaped candies that the organization left outside freshmen girls’ dorm rooms on Valentine’s Day in 2007. TLR, a Harvard student group which promotes abstinence from pre-marital sex, delivered the candy with a note that said, “Why wait? Because you’re worth it.”
“I thought it was kind of weird,” Mancuso said. “True Love Revolution wasn’t an organization that wanted to judge people. But the one thing that I was uncomfortable with was this advocacy that waiting for sex until marriage would make people have more fulfilled lives.”
Despite her initial reaction to the candies, Mancuso later became a board member of TLR. She said that she came to view the organization as a group that accepted students with different viewpoints on the sexual culture at Harvard, particularly those who chose to remain abstinent.
In recent years, however, the group has adopted a greater advocacy role. In addition to its original sole stance endorsing pre-marital abstinence, TLR published official platforms just after Mancuso graduated that denounced same-sex marriage as “harmful” and that affirmed the “equality and differences between the sexes” in discussion of women’s work and motherhood.
Just last week, the organization made its latest change: its name. Current president Luciana E. Milano ’14 published an opinion piece in The Crimson announcing the organization’s conversion to the Harvard College Anscombe Society, a move that Milano said honors British philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe.
“Elizabeth Anscombe was a big figure in 20th century ethics who wrote on issues related to chastity, and we constantly turn to her work to get to the root of our intellectual mission on campus,” Milano said in an interview. “We chose this name as a way to honor her legacy.” The name also matches that of abstinence societies at Princeton, Stanford, the University of Texas, and other schools.
Milano and other board members of the re-christened organization do not see this name change as reflective of a significant shift in priorities. But other students and alumni said they feel the organization has strayed from its original purpose and may alienate potential members.
True Love Revolution, the gathering space for students determined to stay abstinent on a campus where virginity is not the norm, no longer exists. Now, they say, the Anscombe Society exists not as a support group but as a community promoting abstinence, heterosexual marriage, and traditional gender roles.
“This definitely wasn’t how TLR was like from 2006 to 2009,” said Mancuso, who also served on the board of the Harvard-Radcliffe Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporters Alliance, now known as Queer Students and Allies. “It’s unfortunate. It definitely goes against the way I interpreted it and I would absolutely not join if I were a student now.”
PRO-ABSTINENCE SINCE 2006
TLR was founded in 2006 by Justin S. Murray ’07 and Sarah M. Murray ’07, then undergraduates at the college. The couple, who married after graduation, firmly believed in abstinence and wanted to create a safe space on campus for other students like them, former TLR affiliates said.
“True Love Revolution was created in response to the fact that nobody on campus was promoting abstinence,” said Peter A. Syski ’08, who served as TLR webmaster. “It  was intended as a support group for students who wanted to live the abstinent lifestyle because it’s quite difficult when you’re surrounded by everything at Harvard.”
A little more than a year after Syski graduated, students said they remember a distinct change occurring in TLR.
“In 2009, when they announced their stance on traditional marriage, it was seen as a cultural shift and was controversial on campus,” recalled Matthew P. Cavedon ’11, who was then vice president for social justice of the Catholic Students Association. That was the platform that denounced same-sex marriage.
Cavedon said he speculates the shift resulted from a need for some “ethical mooring” to persuade people that abstinence was an acceptable lifestyle.
“They tried to give their beliefs an intellectual foundation, which, in my opinion, was probably a smart move,” he said.
Rachel L. Wagley ’11, who served as TLR president from her sophomore to senior year, agreed with Cavedon that as TLR members were often questioned about their minority view, they needed a reason to give when asked why they believed in abstinence. That included defining marriage itself.
“If you’re holding out for marriage, you have to talk about what marriage is,” said Wagley, who was also involved in the Harvard Republican Club and Christian Impact. “You essentially get into all these side issues that we eventually decided were not just side issues.”
Wagley first announced TLR’s new platform through an email sent over the group’s mailing list in September 2009. In her message, she prefaced the new position statements by acknowledging that they could make TLR more “controversial” but that they “put the value of abstinence in a more intellectual context.”
“Abstinence doesn’t justify itself,” Wagley said.
WHAT WOULD THE FOUNDERS SAY?
Students who were on the TLR executive board prior to 2009 said that they feel the organization’s current positions do not align with what it was originally intended to do.
“The reason that the original founders didn’t want to have positions like these was because they wanted people to focus on the practical issues such as ‘Do I have sex on a one-night stand or not?’—not to make a decision on whether homosexuals can get married or not,” Syski said.
Mancuso said that though TLR had several discussions about those topics in her day, the organization steered clear of public positions.
“It wasn’t originally something exclusive or homophobic,” Mancuso said. “When I was on the board, they welcomed queer people to the meetings, and welcomed people who were sexually active. It really wasn’t a judgmental space.”
Wagley, on the other hand, said that the pro-abstinence nature of TLR was not her primary focus when leading the group. “None of us were in the club because we believed in abstinence. That wasn’t our perspective on it,” she said. “Abstinence is related to pre-marital sex which is related to marriage, the traditional household, and feminism.”
She added, “I didn’t see it as a safe space at all. It wasn’t a support club.”
Jim P. McGlone ’15, a current Anscombe Society board member, echoed this statement. “The goal is to encourage discourse on these issues and to provide an intellectual and philosophical explanation for many of the views that we hold,” he said.
Students not directly affiliated with the Anscombe Society said that they see the organization as having a conservative bent.
“My one concern is that they’re taking more conservative policy stances and that they have a religious connotation.” said Jennifer A. Delurey ’12, who was on the board for the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship. She said she was concerned that non-religious students might interpret the Anscombe Society’s vision of justice as all Christians’ opinion. “People might forget that understandings of what’s just vary within the religious community and the Christian community. I wouldn’t want to be forced to defend what TLR does.”
ALIENATING STANCES
The Anscombe Society’s stance on same-sex marriage, understandably, is deeply unpopular among members of Harvard’s BGLTQ community. But Marco Chan ’11, who served as Queer Students and Allies co-chair for three years, said that the relationship between TLR and QSA did not used to be so strained.
“I’d say the sentiment between our two organizations was somewhere between indifferent and cordial,” said Chan, who also lived in the same hallway was Wagley. “Back then, they were raising awareness on abstinence as being a choice. It never came off as being aggressively moralistic.”
Milano and McGlone say today that they are simply promoting discourse on campus and that they hope any student feels welcome to join the debate.
“This is a pluralistic society,” McGlone said. “If someone disagrees, I’m comfortable with that and I hope they’re comfortable with that too.”
Just recently, in fact, current QSA co-chairs Roland Yang ’14 and Trevor N. Coyle ’14 said that they sat down to dinner with Milano to discuss potential collaboration and to highlight common ground between the two organizations.
But many said they are skeptical that any collaboration could work.
“It’s disingenuous for them to think that they can hold a positive relationship with the LGBT community,” Chan said. “You can’t tell someone ‘I like you and we’re friends, but you’re not my equal’ and be on good terms.”
Students also said they believe that the Anscombe Society’s platform may alienate students who believe in abstinence but not necessarily in the organization’s other positions.
“It’s too bad for those students who are pro-abstinent but who now don’t have a safe space because they don’t agree with the Anscombe Society’s platform,” said Ian D. Lundberg ’15, who is part of both Harvard-Radcliff Christian Fellowship and Harvard College Democrats.
Lundberg, who recently transferred from a Baptist church to an Episcopal church because the Episcopal church supports same-sex marriage, said that he has seen other students who believe in gay marriage feel uncomfortable patronizing churches that denounce it. The same students might steer away from the renamed abstinence group, he said.
“Anscombe Society has a risk of dying out if they hold onto these positions,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lizabeth Cohen, the recently inaugurated dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, brought a multi-faceted lens to the problem of integration in post-World War II urban America in a speech called “Place, People, and Power”—an aptly all-encompassing name for a wide-ranging talk.
In the 1950s, the term “modern”—which had historically been equated with “urban”—underwent a shift as America switched to a more suburban ideal, Cohen said. As the middle class left the cities, large immigrant populations moved in, creating increased segmentation in metropolitan areas. The new cities struggled to survive, leading to a wave of urban renewal projects to “save” them throughout the second half of the 20th century.
Developers attempted to “revitalize cities from fading industrial workshops,” Cohen said, to make them more appealing places to live. But lack of incorporation of residential perspectives frequently led to projects that did not match the needs of citizens.
Yet despite their flaws, Cohen said these projects deserve examination in order to understand their goals and contemporary implications.
“We need to analyze this important moment in city building as history,” she said.
A central figure in her talk was Edward J. Logue, whose ambitious plans served as models for urban renewal in America. She showed a clip of “A City Reborn,” a 1966 video promoting the revitalization of New Haven, Conn., for which Logue was partially responsible. Attempting to create a more sprawling and racially integrated city, the project cleared the slums but ended up further isolating low-income residents, Cohen said.
But more than talking about the flaws of the past, Cohen stressed the importance of looking at the municipal and social goals, not just developer priorities, in today’s urban planning.
“We must move the story beyond a simplistic morality tale of the forces of good and evil,” she said, arguing that neither community members nor companies fully understand the challenges of crafting appropriate urban space.
Attendee Emma Lucken ’14 said, “It’s good to get a perspective of what we should take away from urban renewal—not just the negative consequences, but still seeing it as a problem we need to solve.”

The University of Texas­ announced its participation in the Harvard- and MIT-founded online education venture edX at a press conference Monday morning, making it the first full university system to join since the enterprise launched earlier this year.
The addition of the nine UT schools quadruples the size of edX, which previously included along with the two Cambridge founder schools only the University of California, Berkeley, which announced its participation in July.
“The UT system is one of the leading systems in the nation,” EdX President and MIT professor Anant Agarwal said of the group, which includes UT-Austin and UT-Dallas. “EdX is really excited to work with the UT system in re-inventing learning and dramatically improving success rates among our student populations.”
In May, Harvard announced its collaboration with MIT in the creation of the online learning platform. The first set of free, online Harvard classes began Monday for students around the world.
The UT system, whose flagship school UT-Austin came in thirteenth in the most recent U.S. News and World Report ranking of public universities, has a total enrollment of more than 200,000.
“We wanted to join the world of MOOCs [massive open online courses] and we thought by joining with edX, we could leapfrog into an orbit of excellence,” UT Chancellor Francisco G. Cigarroa said, explaining why the university chose edX over other online education ventures such as Coursera.
Cigarroa also cited access to edX’s open-source foundation code and its role as a business partner in the enterprise as reasons the UT system chose edX. As part of its participation in edX, the Texas system will be part of an advisory council to the edX governing board.
In addition, the UT system will invest $5 million in the development of edX, adding to the original Harvard and MIT pledge of $30 million each. According to Cigarroa, the Texas system will spend another $5 million on helping faculty create new courses that can be taught both virtually and face-to-face, as well as assessing data on student learning.
According to UT administrators, UTx—the online, edX version of the University of Texas—will offer at least four online courses within the next year.
The content of these courses has yet to be determined, but Chairman of the UT System Board of Regents Gene Powell said that UT faculty members will work closely with edX to craft the curricula before presenting them to their respective schools.

Harvard Law School applicants far from Cambridge will have the chance to see, not just hear, their interviewer in the next admissions cycle.
The Law School will interview J.D. applicants via the free videoconferencing software Skype rather than by phone next year and will expand the number of applicants who are offered interviews from about 1,000 to 1,200. Those interviews will also be longer, from under 10 minutes to around 15 minutes.
To accommodate the increase in the number and length of interviews, interviews will be conducted not only by Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Jessica L. Soban but also by Director of Admissions Karen E. Buttenbaum.
“There’s nothing that ultimately replaces being able to physically sit down in a room with someone, but I think that Skype is a great way of approximating that,” Soban said.
To prepare for this expansion, the admissions office spoke with a number of professional schools, including Harvard Business School, which conducts videoconference interviews in addition to phone interviews. Soban said she did not speak to many other law schools, since she believes Harvard Law School is one of few that conducts any applicant interviews, much less interviews via Skype.
“I don’t know why other schools wouldn’t be pushing in this direction, because I think it just really benefits the candidate in being able to get their full story out,” Soban said.
While Skype will be the priority method for interviewing, Soban said, the Law School will accommodate applicants with special needs, such as those with disabilities that make using Skype difficult or those living in places that restrict internet communication.
In anticipation of the expansion, the admissions office is currently conducting internal practice runs and troubleshooting to avoid technical and logistical issues. Soban said it is also testing a new scheduling system to allow applicants to sign up for interview times instead of scheduling via email, as has been done in past years.
Soban, who conducted Skype interviews when she worked as a manager at Bain, said that videoconferencing will not only offer applicants the chance to discuss their passions but also put a face on the Law School for the prospective students.
“Sometimes admissions can feel like a little bit of a black box,” Soban said. “You hit submit on an application and then you don’t know what happens, and at least this way they know for certain that there are people on the other side.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If it had not been for the new architecture studies track in the History of Art and Architecture department, Benjamin Lopez ’15 would have been “pretty ready to transfer” out of Harvard.
Lopez, who discovered his passion for architecture during a Harvard Summer School program in Barcelona this summer, said that the new concentration “definitely fills up a vacancy” at Harvard.
HAA is not alone in widening its curriculum choices. This fall, Harvard College welcomed four new concentration options, including modern Middle Eastern studies in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, a mechanical and an electrical engineering concentration within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and architecture studies in HAA.
These new concentrations were designed to fill gaps in the College’s liberal arts education that had been identified by students seeking to pursue careers in those fields of study and by the departments.
“SOCIAL STUDIES FOR NELC”
“It was so obvious that there was a need. You just have to look at the world around you and see that there’s a need,” said NELC department chair Ali S. Asani ’77 about the new modern Middle East concentration track.
After introducing a secondary field on the same topic last fall, NELC faculty members agreed to propose a concentration track as well, Asani said. Following an approximately seven-month process of conversing with the Office of Undergraduate Education and the Educational Policy Committee, the concentration track was approved for study this fall.
Asani said that the department’s original proposal for the concentration track stayed largely the same through the deliberation process, apart from “a little sort of tweaking here and there.”
Along with this new track, NELC has also created a joint concentration with the history department for undergraduates who want to study the Middle East’s past.
Asani added that the new track allows students to combine studies in humanities and social sciences.
“One of the great things about this track is that it’s really like social studies for NELC,” he said.
Malika Zeghal, who is teaching Modern Middle East 120: “The Arab Revolutions: Popular Uprisings and Political Transformations,” also emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of the modern Middle East track.
The program intends to “offer a strong and diversified curriculum to students interested in studying the history, culture, and politics of the modern Middle East,” she wrote in an email because she could not be reached by phone. “With the historical changes at play since the end of 2010, it only makes more sense for students to study this region.”
Zeghal noted that students can meet their concentration requirements by taking classes in several departments, including history, government, and anthropology.
NELC concentrator John J. Corbett ’13 said that he is “optimistic” about the future of the new concentration track as well as the new joint concentration with history.
“I think it’s a positive change,” he said. “Most of the [NELC] concentrators have been kind of focused on the modern Middle East, informally. It’s nice to have it formalized.”
ARCHITECTS OF A CONCENTRATION
In the past, HAA sent students interested in architecture two T stops away to MIT or even an ocean away to Copenhagen to supplement the department’s curriculum, said HAA professor Alina A. Payne. Now, students can learn about architecture just down the street at Gund Hall.
“We’ve been trying to do this for years, 20 years maybe,” said Payne, who helped spearhead the creation of the architecture studies track, which lets undergraduates do work at the Graduate School of Design. “Unfortunately the GSD did not have the capabilities to join us [before]. They did not have the facilities.”
Previously, she added, students had to hunt for courses to cater to their interests in architecture. Now the department outlines an established program of study linking the practice of architecture with its historical significance.
The distribution requirements in the new track include studio classes, classes at the Design School, and HAA 11: “Landmarks of World Architecture.”
“There will be a trickle at first,” said Payne, but even if early concentrator numbers look low, she said that the track might draw newly admitted students who might have otherwise matriculated at peer institutions which offer architecture programs.
“We did not use to attract freshmen who were interested in architecture,” Payne said. Now, “rather than go to Yale or Princeton, they can come here.”
Professors in HAA said they perceived a need for a dedicated program in architecture at the College.
“We made the case to the University that the study of architecture is as much a part of the core liberal arts education as literature, music, and history of science,” said Design School professor K. Michael Hays.
“Many points of obvious synergy” exist between HAA and the Design School, said HAA Director of Undergraduate Studies David J. Roxburgh. Architecture studies will expose students to both the practical and historical aspects of architecture, said Roxburgh, adding that he sees a “bright future” for the program.
Students said that they are looking forward to Harvard’s liberal arts-focused take on architecture, which is a pre-professional program at most schools.
“Being able to understand how an architect thinks, and not only a historian, will be very valuable for the program,” said HAA concentrator Jack A. Pretto ’14.
“SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TO DO”
Though SEAS students could formerly declare electrical and mechanical engineering tracks under the general concentration, they can now specialize in the titles of their concentrations.
According to Christopher J. Lombardo, assistant director for undergraduate studies in engineering sciences, many students expressed interest in focused tracks in engineering like those frequently found at peer institutions.
“It’s just a nice option to have,” said Tonatiuh M. Lievano Beltran ’13, a mechanical engineering concentrator. “People who want to go into industry will think of it as a big plus.”
SEAS has also introduced a new mechanical engineering course and a new electrical engineering laboratory course. While electrical engineering allows for more electives, Lombardo said, mechanical engineering boasts a more “traditional” list of required courses.
Lombardo said that he expects future expansion for Harvard’s engineering program.
“I think it’s going to continue growing. There’s a bigger visibility of SEAS on campus,” he said, adding that Harvard has yet to add a civil engineering program, another common offering at other colleges.
The creation of a focused electrical engineering concentration “was something that [SEAS] had to do,” said Scott E. Crouch ’13, who switched to the electrical engineering concentration this fall.
Crouch said that the option of a specialized electrical engineering degree “makes [him] feel like more of a legitimate engineer,” and that the new concentrations mark a movement for engineering at Harvard in a “really positive direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A sea of red T-shirts flooded City Hall Monday night as workers from Le Méridien hotel in Cambridge, known until 2007 as Hotel @ MIT, gathered to protest their working conditions and to ask that the city of Cambridge boycott all services provided by the hotel.
The order passed 8-0, with one of the nine members absent.
Le Méridien is owned by HEI Hotels & Resorts, a corporation which purchases, streamlines, and resells hotels, using investments from university endowments and other funds. Harvard previously invested more than $70 million in HEI but in April joined Yale, Princeton, Brown, and other schools when the Harvard Management Company announced that it would not reinvest in the corporation.
Though the workers at Le Méridien are not unionized, they have been receiving assistance in organizing protests from UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents hospitality workers throughout Massachusetts, including those at Harvard and MIT.
Henry C. Green, the financial secretary treasurer of the union, described before the Council what he saw as a stark contrast between the working conditions at unionized hotels in Cambridge and Boston and those at Le Méridien.
According to Green, while unionized workers enjoyed competitive wages, affordable health care, and manageable work schedules, employees at Le Méridien were forced to pay higher health care and co-pay deductibles and to work additional hours without any raise in pay.
“Many workers are working not only one or two but three and sometimes five positions,” Green said.
Bob Boudreau, a bartender at the Le Méridien, echoed Green’s concerns when describing his own experience of being forced to take on multiple jobs without any increase in pay. He realized he was not alone in his frustration after speaking to colleagues six months ago at a meeting facilitated by UNITE HERE.
“One was from the Sudan who sends money home every month to his family,” Boudreau said. “He came with paychecks that showed that his increase in the first year under the management company [HEI] was eight cents per hour and the second was a whopping 11 cents per hour, well under the 18 percent the management company highlights on their website.”
Boudreau noted that many employees, unable to afford the cost of the company’s health care plan, either opt to join MassHealth, a state-sponsored health care program for the needy, or forgo insurance altogether.
He recounted his dismay when one of his colleagues told him he was dropping his health insurance.
“He is taking a gamble on his health, and for a full-time worker to take that gamble today, it’s not right,” Boudreau said.
Vice Mayor E. Denise Simmons noted that the Council had held many past functions, including inaugural celebrations, at the hotel. Such events would move elsewhere under the order.
“I don’t think we should be paying for other people’s oppression by having functions at that establishment,” she said.
Simmons also voiced her support for the workers and their decision to mobilize.
“It’s easy to sort of cower and not stand up for your rights, hoping that everything will be okay,” she said. “This is a brave step that the employees of the hotel have taken.”
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 expressed hope that Le Méridien would change its pay structure by the end of October. If an agreement could not be reached, he presented the Council with an alternate plan: a Halloween protest.
“We should go over to the hotel for that night and have a demonstration and we should just boo all night,” Reeves said. “Maybe the Halloween holiday will bring someone to their senses, get all the bad spirits to go away.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rebecca C. Maddalo ’13 was sitting in the basement of Sever Hall in Harvard Yard at 7:12 on Tuesday evening when she felt her chair begin to shake. Wondering what might have caused the mysterious rumbling, she looked online for clues.
“At first I thought it was maybe the T,” she said. “It was just weird.”
In reality, a 4.0 magnitude earthquake centered in Maine and felt throughout New England rattled Maddalo and other students at the College. The majority of Harvard students reached by The Crimson for interviews Tuesday evening said they did not feel the earthquake. Among those who did, reactions ranged from indifference to mild annoyance.
“I was basically sitting on my computer and my chair was shaking. It wasn’t really big deal,” said Thomas J. Gaudett ’14. “I immediately went online to use Facebook and Twitter to see what it was, and that’s pretty much it.”
Jennifer T. Soong ’14, who is also a Crimson arts editor, described the earthquake as slightly more dramatic than a minor quake she experienced last summer in New Jersey.
“I felt the sudden shaking and all the sudden my roommate came out into the common room and I just said ‘Is that a fucking earthquake?’” she said. “My roommate said ‘I don’t know. I think it was just a rager next door.’”
The 4.0 magnitude places the earthquake among the 13,000 estimated tremors of similar strength that strike around the world every year, according to the United States Geological Survey.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello told The Crimson in an email that he had not seen any reports of damage or injury in Cambridge.
The last earthquake to cause damage in Maine occurred in 1957, when a seism broke windows and dishes in Portland. A 1965 shock hit Nantucket Island in Massachusetts, leading to reports of damaged ornaments, according to the United States Geological Survey.
More recently, residents across the eastern seaboard felt a 5.9 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter in Virgnia in August 2011. That earthquake surprised locals, many of whom had never experienced an earthquake before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although sophomore May Cascells-Hamby may have gotten this week’s Athlete of the Week award, plenty of other Harvard athletes submitted excellent performances over the last week that merited recognition of their own.
 
Colton Chapple, Football
In the Crimson’s 28-0 victory over Bucknell on Saturday, Chapple turned in another four-touchdown performance—marking the third straight week he’s done so. Not coincidentally, Chapple is making his third straight appearance on The Crimson’s AOTW runners-up list in a week where he had a hand in four of five straight touchdowns that broke open a 0-0 stalemate with the Bison. In addition to passing touchdowns to Cameron Brate and Kyle Juszczyk, Chapple had a fifty-nine yard touchdown run that was his season long. He had 120 yards on eight carries and 189 through the air on just 18 attempts, compiling 11.9 yards per touch on the day. With the win, Chapple helped lead the team to its 14th straight victory—currently tops in Division 1.
Zach Hodges, Football
On the other side of the ball, Zach Hodges excelled for the Crimson defensively on Saturday in helping to hold Bucknell to one touchdown. Hodges, who has provided an immediate impact in his sophomore season with five and a half sacks, had three and a half tackles for losses on Saturday to bring his season total up to 10. Hodges began this season with three tackles for losses and two sacks in Harvard’s season-opening 28-13 win against San Diego and has not slowed down since, with at least half a sack and one tackle for loss in every game this year. Hodges helped lead a Crimson defense that held Bucknell to 3.3 yards per offensive snap and the Bison’s leading rusher, Jeremiah Young, to just 1.8 yards a carry.
Taylor Docter, Volleyball
 
As a senior, Taylor Docter is enjoying her best year as a member of the Harvard women’s volleyball team. Docter had 21 kills against Columbia on Saturday, two below the career high that she set earlier this year in a five-set loss to Dartmouth. She added 12 digs and 23 total points, tying her best score from this year. After seven straight losses, Docter and the rest of the Crimson have rallied to win five of seven to move into third in the Ivy League, with one of the losses being a tight five-setter against second-place Princeton. For the weekend, Docter had 35 kills, 18 digs, and 40 points as the Crimson knocked off the two teams below them in the standings in Cornell and Columbia—dropping only one set in the process and moving from fifth to third in the conference.

At the end of the first half, the Harvard women’s soccer team remained in a scoreless deadlock with last-place Brown. Despite outshooting the Bears, 10-4, in the first 45 minutes of the conference matchup, including five on goal, the Crimson could not find the back of the net.
Then Meg Casscells-Hamby went off.
The sophomore midfielder was all over the field, posting two goals and adding two assists in the second half as Harvard blitzed past Brown on Saturday afternoon in Providence.
“Meg was awesome,” sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten said. “Last year and this year, she’s just been a huge part of our offense. She scores a lot and is obviously a big playmaker, but she also sets up other people to score, which is important because she’s dangerous in a lot of different ways.”
The Bears got a good glimpse at all facets of Casscells-Hamby’s game as she led the Crimson to victory.
The win was particularly important because it ensured that Harvard, currently fourth in the Ivy League, has a chance to defend its crown, with a game against first-place Princeton still looming.
The four goals were the team’s most since notching five against New Hampshire on Sept. 25, 2011.
“It was nice to go out in the second half and finish [on] our opportunities, because we’ve had a little bit of trouble doing that this season,” Casscells-Hamby said. “So it was great that the goals finally came.”
Harvard is undefeated in its last five contests, and the Crimson was able to continue its streak on Saturday by beating the Bears for the fourth time in their past five matchups.
Harvard has held its opponents to just four goals in its last six matches.
In the first half, the Crimson’s defensive dominance continued, but the team sensed urgency and thus came out aggressively on offense to begin the second half, according to Kanten.
“We came out of halftime and realized where we were—we only had 45 minutes to score, Kanten said. “This game was going to determine what happens to the rest of us for the rest of our season, so we realized we had to score.”
Casscells-Hamby came out of the break and led the charge on offense to salvage the season.
Just over five minutes into the second half, the sophomore received the ball off of a deflection after sophomore Lauren Urke’s corner kick. Unfazed, Casscells-Hamby knocked a high shot off the crossbar and in to commence the scoring and put Harvard on top.
She didn’t stay idle for long. Just eight minutes later, she earned an assist on a score by junior forward Elizabeth Weisman, who scored after freshman midfielder Haley Washburn’s header clanked off the crossbar.
In the 63rd minute, Casscells-Hamby streaked into the box, took a cross from freshman forward Lauren Varela, and directed the ball into the back of the net on one touch to extend Harvard’s lead to 3-1.
Casscells-Hamby leads the Crimson with five goals on the season, and is second with three assists. She would add her second assist of the game in the 68th minute in a give-and-go sequence with senior defender and Crimson sports executive Taryn I. Kurcz, who shot it off the left post and in to seal the win. Kanten praised Casscells-Hamby’s recognition of the situation and acute decision-making to help the team.
“It’s very important to pay attention to assists,” Kanten said. “A lot of players probably would’ve taken those shots themselves and may or may not have scored, but Meg saw the opportunity and passed the ball.... It’s a great example of how she’s a selfless player and has a team-first attitude.”
Casscells-Hamby, for her part, downplayed her individual accomplishments, and instead labeled the game a well-deserved team victory.
“It was just a great team performance,” Casscells-Hamby said. “None of the goals would’ve come if our defense wasn’t so great back there. We really just focused on our defense, and the offense eventually came.”
From here, the ultimate goal is to finish atop the Ancient Eight, but the team cannot look that far ahead, Casscells-Hamby explained.
“We’re just going to focus on the next game and not the title yet,” Casscells-Hamby said. “But as long as we keep working hard to get goals and keep winning, then everything will fall into place.”
No matter the course Harvard’s season takes from here, the team can count on Casscells-Hamby to play a pivotal role.
“We know that Meg will create chances for us no matter where she is,” Kanten said. “And that makes it very hard for other teams to deal with her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer season has suffered some heartbreaking losses, with its single win of the season occurring over a month ago against Michigan State.
Since beating the Spartans, the Crimson (1-7-3, 0-2-1 Ivy) has competed in eight games, tying two of them and dropping the other six.
Harvard has traveled as far afield as California this season, but Tuesday’s upcoming match is right down the road against Boston University (4-6-4, 1-1-2 America East) at 7 p.m. at Nickelson Field.
The game will be the Crimson’s second-to-last non-conference game for the season. Since Harvard has played three ranked teams on its schedule so far, the Terriers are—on paper—a less formidable opponent than those it has faced in the past.
“We are pretty excited to take on BU,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “We feel as though we have a good chance. They have had a similar season as us—playing a tough schedule and not getting the outcomes. It should be an exciting match.”
Although the Crimson has not registered many wins, its matches have consistently ended with a difference of only one goal. No. 3 UC Santa Barbara edged out Harvard, 2-1, while No. 19 Brown barely clinched a one-goal victory over the Crimson, 2-1, in overtime.
“What’s going to be the difference?” Friedman said. “How are we going to come up 2-1 on the other side? We’re losing by that one goal, a late goal, when somehow the ball sneaks in behind us. How can we be on the other side of that? That’s what we’re figuring out right now.”
Harvard has not had much luck in conference play, with its last in-conference victory coming on Nov. 13, 2010, against Penn. The Crimson is ranked sixth in the Ancient Eight—tied with Yale, which Harvard tied, 0-0, earlier in the season.
Since a league title seems out of reach for the Crimson, this match against BU is a welcome break from the pressures of conference play in which Harvard can build momentum and confidence down the home stretch.
“It’s another non-Ivy league game,” senior forward Zack Wolfenzen said. “I only have a few more games wearing that Harvard jersey and, quite frankly, I’m pumped up for every single one of them. I think I can say the same for the other seniors. It’s a chance to do what we love.”
Tuesday night’s matchup will be the closest game to home for Crimson for the rest of the month. The next, and final, home game will be Senior Night against Columbia on Nov. 3.
Although the Terriers have beaten Harvard in the past two contests, 2-1, the Crimson has historically gotten the best of its crosstown rivals with an overall record of 23-14-6. Both teams have losing records this season, but BU has registered three more wins than Harvard. The Crimson and the Terriers both lost to Brown and UConn, so their records point to an even match.
“You want to get results,” Friedman said “You want to win.”
Leading the Harvard offense with two goals apiece, freshman Jake Freeman, sophomore Hiroki Kobayashi and freshman Oliver White will challenge the BU defense led by Sanford Spivey, a 2011 America East All-Rookie team honoree. The Terrier defense is lacking America East Defender of the Year Kelvin Madzongwe, who has been injured since September.
The Crimson defense faces a threatening BU attack with leading scorer sophomore forward Parker Powell and playmaker junior Anthony Ciccone. Harvard freshmen goalies Joe Festa and Evan Mendez—who have split time this season in relief of presumptive starter Brett Conrad—have save percentages of 0.714 and 0.688, respectively.
“Right now we’re really asking ourselves, can we win a game that we aren’t supposed to win?” Friedman said. “Can we sneak a goal in? Can we be the team to give a little hell first?”
As the Crimson tries to find its identity, its spirits remain high, with the team recognizing its unrealized potential to perform at a high level.
“We are a good team. That’s what makes it fun,” Wolfenzen said. “We’ve had teams in the past where we had even better records than the one we have now, but people checked out. We have a great group of guys who work hard every day. That’s what makes me come back day in and day out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The middle of October brings midterms and essays for most Harvard students. But for the members of the Crimson sailing team, the middle of October marks the halfway point of the season.
This weekend, the coed and women sailing teams showed signs of good things to come in the remaining weeks of competition. The coed squad traveled to Dartmouth College, where they took sixth place in the Captain Hurst Bowl. Meanwhile, members of the women’s team competed in the 2012 Yale Women’s Intersectional Regatta, placing eighth overall.
Both finishes marked the highest for Harvard since the coed team took sixth place in the Hood Trophy Regatta on Sept. 23. It has been a tough year for the Crimson due to the loss of graduating seniors, including All-American Brendan Kopp.
Although he is not quite pleased with his team’s results, Harvard coach Mike O’Connor is happy with the improvements he has seen in the team.
“We have seen results that indicate vast improvements over years past for particular players,” O’Connor said. “We had an event where a couple of our juniors won at Tufts, and those same two skippers competed at the regatta two years ago and finished last…. It was a similar situation with [Morgan] Russom and [Isabel] Ruane. Two years ago at the Yale regatta they finished around 15th and this past weekend they were second.”
O’Connor would like to see more regular success as the team heads into the fall championship season.
“Well, we need to be more consistent,” O’Connor said. “Particularly, we need to execute good starts more consistently.  I would also like to see us improve in our heavy-air technique. It’s something that we really need to work on, particularly in the late fall and early spring when it tends to be pretty windy and we need to be faster when the breeze is on.”
CAPTAIN HURST BOWL
The Crimson co-ed squad scored a total of 108 points in the Captain Hurst Bowl, just good enough for the sixth overall spot.
Its point total stood one point behind the fifth place finishers from Brown and two points ahead of the Midshipmen from Navy.
Sophomore skipper Gram Slattery and junior crew Alma Lafleer raced in the A division for Harvard. The duo recorded four single-digit finishes over the course of the weekend.
They scored 43 total points, fourth place in the A division. In the B division, freshmen Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky finished in eighth place for the Crimson. The freshman pair tallied 65 total points.
Boston College won the regatta with a total score of 74 points, 54 coming from the A division and the remaining 20 in the B Division.
The regatta was held in honor of recently deceased former Dartmouth sailing coach Captain William Hurst.
2012 YALE WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONAL REGATTA
Over in New Haven, the Harvard women’s team took the eight overall spot in the 2012 Yale Women’s Intersectional Regatta. The Crimson tied with the Rams from the University of Rhode Island, as each team scored 146 total points. Harvard won the tie-breaker.
Juniors Ruane and Russom finished in second place in the A division. The duo scored 49 points, just four points ahead of the host-team Bulldogs, in six races. It marked the highest finish for either team on the weekend.
“We were excited about the result,” Ruane said. “We were nervous about this regatta because of the competition. It was really windy and there were really challenging conditions, along with the really competitive fleet. So we were just looking to do our best, and it was better than we could have hoped.”
Junior Caitlin Watson and Jacquelyn Cooley, freshman Sophie Bermudez, and sophomore Emma Smith alternated in the B division boat. By the end of the weekend, the foursome racked up 97 points.
Dartmouth and Yale stood neck and neck on the final day of competition. In the end, the Big Green prevailed with 78 points, slightly less than the Bulldog’s total of 84.
Ruane acknowledged the season’s challenges but remained confident in her teammates as they head into the final stretch of the fall season.
“In general, we had ups and downs for the team,” Ruane said. “The girls are looking better and better each weekend, and we are seeing the results of our hard work.... I think we have to continue the energy and dedication we have shown so far. We’ve really come together the past two weeks as a team. We are all working together, and we have to keep working as it gets colder and windier.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team’s season opener less than a month away, The Back Page is breaking down the Crimson’s non-conference opponents. Each week, we will take a look at two new foes. Last Thursday we profiled MIT. Next up is UMass.
In just over four weeks, the Harvard men’s basketball squad will head down the Mass Pike to Amherst, where it opens its Division I schedule against the University of Massachusetts on Nov. 13. Despite dotting its non-conference schedule with other Atlantic-10 opponents like St. Joseph’s and Fordham in recent years, Harvard has not faced UMass in over two decades. The Minutemen dominated the last rendition of this interstate matchup in 1991, cruising to a 35-point win.
Harvard should certainly be able to improve on its last performance against UMass, but the Crimson will not have an easy time with an athletic Minuteman squad that has received some preseason hype.
UMass exceeded expectations last season, posting a 25-12 record and a fifth-place finish in the A-10 before reaching the NIT semifinals. The Minutemen, picked to finish fifth in the A-10 in the preseason coaches’ poll, return four of five starters from last season, including standout point guard Chaz Williams, a preseason pick for the Atlantic-10 First Team. Joining the 5’9” Williams in the backcourt will likely be junior Jesse Morgan, who averaged a shade under 10 points per contest last season. Following a summer wrist injury, Morgan expects to be fully healthy for the season.
Up front, UMass will likely be anchored by a crew of long, athletic forwards. Junior Raphiael Putney, last season’s second leading scorer, returns along with fellow big man Cady Lalanne, a 6’9” forward/center who looks to be fully healthy after being hampered by a foot injury last season. Senior Terrell Vinson, a versatile 6’7” forward, and 6’8” senior forward Samson Carter add to the Minutemen’s depth in the front court.
Fans might be tempted to sleep through the contest given the unorthodox 10 a.m. start time, a result of the game being featured as part of ESPN’s Tip-Off Marathon, but this matchup between two of Massachusetts’ top teams should not be missed.

For the student on a budget, attending The Harvard Culinary Society's Biannual Restaurant Expo is a worthwhile investment.
 
This semester's Restaurant Expo, held on Oct. 15, featured classic Harvard hangouts like BerryLine as well as more exotic eateries like Tamarind Bay. Cuisine ranged from Qdoba's naked burritos to Vegetable Planet's Reuben sandwiches, and portions ranged from bite-sized to meal-worthy. The upscale Finale Bakery proffered bite-sized tiramisu and chocolate mousse samples meanwhile Upper Crust and Crazy Dough's Pizza left whole slices up for grabs. 
 
"This is the first time we've gotten Qdoba food and guac wasn't extra," Jonathan H. Choi '13 said. "I would love to see more events like this."
 
In addition to a providing a free, non-HUDS dinner, the Restaurant Expo gave thrift-seekers ample opportunity to score some deals. Tamarind Bay handed out 15 percent off coupons, and BerryLine doled out half-filled stamp cards, leaving students five rather than ten purchases away from a free medium-sized, 1 topping frozen yogurt.
 
"Every semester, we e-mail about forty restaurants about participating in the Expo and get about nine responses saying 'yes,'" said Rebecca A. Ruskin '13, President of The Harvard Culinary Society. 
 
The group has also reached out to the pricier restaurants in the area, but these restaurants usually decline the offer.
 
The Harvard Culinary Society staged its first Restaurant Expo only last fall, and so far the group has focused on connecting with eateries in and around Harvard Square. For next semester, however, the group is considering a "Quad Food Expo" to highlight the culinary options beyond the Square.

After a presidential debate that catapulted Mitt Romney ahead in the polls and an even more rousing vice presidential showdown last Thursday, we're eager to see what tonight's penultimate, round three debate at Hofstra University will bring. As both casual observers and huge "Sesame Street" fans, here are five things Flyby will be looking for tonight.
1. What about Elmo, Ernie, and the Cookie Monster?
Although Mitt Romney admitted his admiration for Big Bird in Denver, it remains to be seen how much he cares about the other characters. We're a bit partial to Elmo ourselves, and we felt neglected on his behalf. Hopefully he'll get a little bit of love tonight.
2. Can Romney top Denver?
With a commanding performance last time around, Romney comes into tonight as the favorite to win the debate. Can Mitt pull off another win?
3. Who will the topics favor?
The topics in the first debate, such as the economy and health care, lent themselves to an attack on Obama's record that Romney successfully deployed. Tonight's discussion will feature questions from the audience that could veer toward foreign policy topics Obama is more comfortable discussing.
4. Numbers, Numbers, Numbers
Cable station pundits quickly pointed out that Obama referenced neither the "one percent" nor Romney's "47 percent" during the first debate. But what about the eight percent (our nation's unemployment rate), the 1.3 percent (the inflation rate), the 49 percent (Obama's approval rating), or the 68 percent (percentage of American women who think Obama is more equipped to handle an alien invasion)?
5. Mittens
Mitt Romney has accumulated a lot of nicknames over the course of this campaign, including "The Mittster" and our personal favorite, "Mittens." With tonight's projected low of 45 degrees at Hofstra University, will the Mittster be debuting a new pair of mittens?

UPDATED: October 16, 2012, at 4:17 p.m.
In The Harvard Voice's first individually-attributed blog post since last spring, co-president and co-editor-in-chief of the publication April A. Sperry '13 posted "A Response to the '5 People' Situation" on Monday night, apologizing "to anyone who was offended or in any manner hurt by the comments about Asians in the recruiting process."
Below is an excerpt from Sperry's response:
"As was mentioned in the article's note from the editors, the post in question is not and never was endorsed by the organization as a whole. The Voice staff did not collaborate to conceptualize or write this article. It was written by one contributor who has asked to remain anonymous. The article was sent to one staff member who published it and mistakenly attributed it to the staff as a whole. Do we all agree with the opinions and insinuations reflected in the article? No."
Sperry ended her note by writing: "It's there, it's in the open, and there's not a whole lot more we can do about it at this point. We've made mistakes and we're doing our best to deal with the consequences."
We at Flyby sincerely hope that the Voice remembers to attribute the next "extremely controversial" (read: racist and inappropriate) piece it publishes to a specific writer, lest the world at large keep spreading the unfortunate rumor that we've all lost it.
The comments section on the now-infamous (and radically revised) "5 People" post has been re-opened. Not that they need your feedback—the lesson, Sperry wrote, has been "well learned."

Harvard students from the River to the Quad reported feeling earthquake tremors tonight at about 7:12 p.m.
The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the tremors were caused by a magnitude 4.5 quake near Lake Arrowhead, Maine.
"I thought it was just my stomach, because I was really hungry," said Nathalie R. Miraval '14, a Crimson news writer.
