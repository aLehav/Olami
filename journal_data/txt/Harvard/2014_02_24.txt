The title of George Saunders' most recent short story collection, “Tenth of December,” is entirely fitting: like a wintry, windswept landscape, Saunders' stories are both breathtakingly beautiful and unremittingly bleak. The stories in “Tenth of December” are set in a very near future in which science and technology reign supreme. They are full of strange details—chemicals that create artificial emotions make multiple appearances—yet they address issues familiar to any reader. The standout of the collection, "The Semplica-Girl Diaries," skillfully intertwines science fiction-esque ideas with the worries and goals of an average middle-class family; the result is a devastating critique of consumerism and economic exploitation. These themes—particularly economic and social inequality, familial dysfunction, and the dark side of consumer capitalism—tie the stories together and make for an admirably coherent and effective whole.
 
Saunders has a well-earned reputation as one of the most relentlessly innovative writers in literature today, and his most recent collection continues to push the boundaries of storytelling. One story, "Sticks," is only two pages long, yet within it Saunders manages to paint a deeply affecting picture of a family's entire history together. The incredible restraint of "Sticks" allows a certain dark beauty to emerge in all the things Saunders leaves unsaid. This sort of selective exclusion characterizes Saunders's work. Another piece, "Exhortation," consists entirely of a mysterious office memo referring to "Room 6." What goes on in Room 6 is never explicitly stated, as Saunders prefers instead to let the tension of the story build slowly, almost invisibly. Other stories are told as diaries, or stream-of-consciousness narratives, or from the standpoint of a chemically altered state of mind, and Saunders pulls off each new approach brilliantly.
 
“Tenth of December” draws the reader in with its black humor and razor-sharp, perceptive commentary on modern life. The stories are relatable, often amusing, and always captivating, and they hit with an emotional impact that leaves the reader breathless.

On February 4, 24-year-old Rachel Frederickson made headlines when she won NBC’s “The Biggest Loser” after losing 155 pounds, or 60 percent of her body weight.  At 5 feet 4 inches, and now a size 0-2, Frederickson has garnered national attention for being “too thin.” Reporters and bloggers have claimed that she and the show went too far. They point out that Frederickson’s final weight gives her a BMI below 18.5—“underweight,” according to the CDC. Others use her body shape as their central argument. As Time Magazine put it, “It’s easy to see that Frederickson looks unhealthy. … People at home were wriggling in their seats at the sight of her now-emaciated body.” Twitter users have called her story “terrifying and depressing.” One was “seriously concerned that the confetti [would] knock Rachel over.”
So, before the show, Fredrickson was too heavy. That was bad. Now she is too thin. This is also bad. I can imagine the show’s executive producers sitting in a room thinking, “Crap, rewind to twenty pounds ago and ‘The Biggest Loser’ could have seamlessly moved on to its 16th season.” Whatever that perfect weight might have been, Frederickson missed it. But what if she had lost just 100 pounds? Would she have earned our congratulations and admiration? 
Although it’s good that viewers are reconsidering “The Biggest Loser,” the rhetoric of most commentators is grounded in the same weight-shaming and body-idealizing philosophy that makes the show problematic in the first place. In declaring that Fredrickson is too skinny or needs to go to an eating disorder rehabilitation center, we reduce Fredrickson to her body shape. We carelessly diagnose her with a serious psychiatric illness, anorexia, just by looking at her, and slap moral valence onto her “weight loss journey.” We impose our definition of health in the same emotionally torturous way that “The Biggest Loser” does.
One of the problems with The Biggest Loser is that, except for its tearful pep talks, it presents weight as entirely within one’s control, a mere function of one’s work ethic. The show gives contestants a few opportunities to share stories of trauma and emotional abuse, but the real reason these “Losers” are on national television is that they are obese objects in need of fixing. It is the mission of the “charismatic trainers” to motivate them to lose drastic amounts of weight in short periods of time. The higher the percentage of body weight they lose, the longer they get to stay on the show, and the more likely they are to win $250,000 (and a lifetime supply of weight-loss-engendered happiness).
I understand the appeal of “The Biggest Loser” for the contestants. Lose weight, win money: You don’t even have to woo judges or sleep outside like on other reality shows. In fact, if I were on “The Biggest Loser,” I think I could win. I might have an unfair advantage having struggled with bulimia for five years. But can I let you in on a secret? I spent entire summers losing weight by binging and purging; minus passing out in the shower a few times and destroying my gums, I did quite a good job. No, I spent no time with friends, and no, it was not sustainable at school, and yes, a few times I wondered how to self-induce a coma, but I don’t think they would air those parts on TV. After all, the giant scale that contestants weigh themselves on at the end of each episode, where the weight reading jumps around like a crappy significant other who can’t decide whether or not to leave you, doesn’t measure your emotional wellbeing or your self-worth. (I weighed 50 pounds when I was in third grade – does that mean I was a better human back then?) I could win the competition by whittling my body down to nothing, to the point where I would be confused as to whether I was dead or alive, and earn a quarter of a million dollars.
By equating the number on a scale with physical and emotional wellbeing, the contest ignores the mental health of its contestants. “The Biggest Loser” doesn’t trouble itself with the complex relationship between food and emotions; rather, it frames weight loss as a straightforward (and, of course, financially profitable) enterprise.  However, in all the press surrounding the show’s finale, it is clear that neither the show nor its audience care about Fredrickson or the other contestants. The show shamed Frederickson into losing weight, and now audiences are shaming her into gaining. The show neglected her mental health, all in the name of health, and now commentators are equally ignorant in pushing her to gain weight. We as a society care about that number on the scale, not the person whose bones, muscles, and—yes—fatty tissue comprise that number. Rather than critiquing Fredrickson, we ought to consider the dangerous implications of the discourse around “too fat” and “too thin” for all of us.

Ideas are the cornerstone of the American economy. When good ideas prevail, everyone wins. But the market for good ideas is saturated, and it’s hard to compete. There’s even a market of ideas for how to break into the market of ideas. As a new innovator myself, I’m a consumer in this market, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s broken: We constrain innovation by defining it narrowly.
 
The first constraint on innovation derives from how people think about non-profit versus for-profit enterprises. A few weeks ago, I attended a Harvard Innovation Lab event called “Writing a Great Challenge Proposal: Last Minute Advice from Former Finalists” and designed to help students prepare for the President’s Challenge. During the event, an entrepreneur asked the panel of experts how a non-profit could meet the i-Lab competition’s sustainability and profitability criteria. One panelist responded, “Don’t start a non-profit,” led the all-male panel in a round of laugher, and then added an unconvincing “just kidding.”
 
This was infuriating to me. I am working with a group of graduate students on a non-profit called CommonLit.org that creates free resources for middle school literacy teachers. The panelist’s comment embodied a perspective we have run into in subtler forms over the past five months (although i-Lab Managing Director Gordon Jones proved wonderfully supportive after we reached out to him). Many people in the innovation sphere think that the business world does innovation best. They also assume that the structures that work in the for-profit arena should be applied to everyone, in every sector. These people seem to believe that for an innovation to be truly innovative, its creators must figure out a way to effect positive change and turn a profit at the same time.
 
When we started CommonLit, we considered for-profit status, and we probably could have made a great deal of money by selling our product to school districts—the curriculum market is huge. But we decided that because our idea had the potential to dramatically improve education throughout the country, it would be unconscionable to put our product behind a paywall. That’s why we incorporated as a non-profit and made our resource free for everyone.
 
While I certainly believe that a company can do good and make money at the same time, I don’t believe that IRS filing status says anything about the innovative value of an idea. In fact, some of the most innovative ideas succeed precisely because their benefits are widely dispersed within society, rather than concentrated (think of the internet). The whole point of having tax-exempt non-profits is that some worthwhile endeavors can never pay for themselves, but we want them to exist anyway. Non-profits aren’t hobbled shadows of their profit-making counterparts; they’re a different animal altogether. The basis for starting a non-profit is the judgment that consumers can’t or shouldn’t pay for the product.
 
The second constraint on innovation derives from the assumption that “innovation” means “technological innovation.” This misconception leads to thinking that an idea is not innovative unless it incorporates new technology. In the education sector in which I work, such a notion encourages innovators to churn out mobile apps and e-learning software. To be clear, this technology can provide a wonderful resource for some purposes, like helping struggling students learn vocabulary or assisting teachers in tracking grades. But the education sector seems to be falling into the trap of viewing technology as a panacea for a flailing school system, and substituting technological capability for serious judgments about what is best for children.
 
This technological triumphalism too often masks the pernicious effects of the profitable commoditization of the minds of children. When innovators design products to appeal to a market of pre-teen consumers, the result is FlappyBird, not “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” Gamification may be the future of the iTunes app store; it shouldn’t be the future of the American education system. Would you want Clippy from Microsoft Word teaching your child to read Shakespeare?
 
Innovations in the education sector should help teachers, not replace them. Technology now allows us to create learning software in which every piece of information students see is tailored to their individual interests by advanced algorithms. This is a good system for Netflix, because in my spare time I do want to watch foreign romantic dramas featuring strong female leads. But a great education does the opposite: It pushes learners toward challenging, novel, and sometimes uncomfortable concepts and encourages students to develop shared understandings with their classmates. Children in schools aren’t consumers—they need to be shaped. Teachers become teachers because they are interested in building communities and shaping minds. This is an awesome responsibility, and one innovators must shoulder as well.
 
My experience has taught me that by failing to recognize the limits of the profit motive and of technology, we steer innovators down a narrow path. This speaks to a larger problem: When we create a set of rules about how to change the world, we push innovators away from the truly creative ideas that challenge the status quo on a deep level.

In one of its several new initiatives this semester, the Undergraduate Council recently began working on a proposal to reduce the cost of course materials. Inspired by one of the presidential campaign promises from current Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the initiative seeks to rein in expenses by requiring faculty to state the prices of required materials on syllabi. Students would fully understand the costs of taking a course before enrolling. Over the long run, they could see which courses have worked to decrease the cost of materials. The UC also aims to push for more online-available materials in the longer term. Instructors should take note of the UC’s proposal and work to make class materials more affordable.
  Course materials have perennially presented a serious expense for students.  Students spend  an average of $1,340 per year on course materials, and though those with financial aid receive a significant sum towards covering this expense, many must sacrifice other items for books and supplies. As former Dean of the College Benedict Gross ’71 and former Interim Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles wrote in a letter to faculty on this subject in 2007, “Students either skimp on daily expenses to purchase course materials, or skimp on their books to make ends meet.” Renewing efforts to reduce this burden should be a priority, and we applaud the UC for making a serious attempt to tackle this issue.
 In its specifics, the current plan is wise to focus on increasing the information available to students about course materials costs. The increased transparency would certainly be a boon for students choosing courses. It would encourage professors to create cost-conscious syllabi and to use online resources more effectively in order to attract enrollment. Despite the apparent frugality of online materials, however, we caution against overreliance on their use as a method of cost-containment; if professors are insistent that students come to class with physical copies of readings, the expense and inconvenience of printing might outweigh any benefits gained. Instructors should also pay careful attention to copyright law, a consideration that increasingly seems to have fallen by the wayside, as scanned books are placed on course websites without permission.
 The effort to rein in the cost of course materials is a positive example of the useful issues that the UC’s new leadership has begun to tackle. While we have expressed certain reservations about the details of the UC’s recent request for $250,000 from the University, initiatives like the funding push and “Operation Ghost Protocol” and now the course materials effort attest to the many serious proposals emanating from a reinvigorated UC. 
 Ultimately, practical issues that directly impact students—like the cost of course materials—are ideal areas in which the UC can improve student life. The current proposal, with its focus on transparency and incentivizing faculty action, merits support and thoughtful implementation to ensure that the cost of books and supplies becomes a less persistent detriment to a positive student experience.

The Economic Man was utterly out of gift ideas for his girlfriend, the Economic Woman, for Valentine’s Day.
They had just celebrated their fourth anniversary. Between birthdays, Christmas, and anniversaries, he had exhausted his imagination.
The Economic Man is not exactly a romantic. Love is irrational, but Rational is the Economic Man’s middle name. Love is blind, but the Economic Man wants perfect information. Love is priceless, but the Economic Man believes in the price mechanism.
Take gift giving, for example. Gifts are a useful signal. An expensive gift will show how much the Economic Man cares about the Economic Woman, even if the gift does not improve the Economic Woman’s welfare. The gift of the Magi may well be futile and decrease the consumption-possibility frontier, but the sacrificial giving makes the young couple and the reader sob for true love. The demand to show credibility in commitment creates a market for diamond rings. The wildly expensive gem may have broken many wallets, but its absence will lead to more broken (non-credible) promises and hearts.
Ever since the Economic Man showed up unannounced at the Economic Woman’s Princeton dorm two years ago for her birthday, he has found it harder and harder to surprise her. The Economic Man faces a tricky intertemporal decision. If he plans this Valentine’s Day too perfectly, it will be harder to please the hedonistically adapted Economic Woman in the future. If he plans the day too poorly, he may not spend the next Valentine’s Day with the Economic Woman at all. Even in the irrational world of love, the Economic Man understands the importance of the interior solution.
The Economic Woman is more of a romantic. She enjoys the annual rose delivery by the Economic Man. But even she is dissatisfied with Valentine’s Day. She wonders why Economic Man only gives her roses and brings her to prix fixe dinners on the same day that high demand for such goods generate high premium. She does not like that her beloved “Veblentine” goods are more popular as prices increase, breaking the law of demand.
She reasons that the point of Valentine’s Day is not for romantics to enjoy romance. The romantics can celebrate privately on their anniversary—or any day, really. Valentine’s Day is for romantics to publicly flaunt their romance with conspicuous consumption. Love is not simply a mutually beneficial exchange between two individuals, as she thought. It has negative externalities and deadweight loss, because all her single friends collectively become slightly bitter. The social cost of public display of affection makes it socially distasteful, but much less so on a publicly sanctioned day to celebrate romance. The extra cost of Valentine’s Day consumption may be a just price to pay for the acceptance of her public display of affection.
The Economic Woman was facing a liquidity crisis, as her paycheck did not arrive on time. So the Economic Man decided to give her $70 in cash. He thought it was his best gift idea ever, because cash allowed the Economic Woman to maximize her consumption bundle as it pleased her. Most economists, however, disagree with the Economic Man. His professor Eric Maskin says, tongue in cheek, “Only an economist could think like this”.
Surprisingly, the Economic Woman, who does not study economics, agreed with the Economic Man and enjoyed the gift. Despite their bounded rationality, the Economic Man and the Economic Woman magically solved the principal-agent problem together because they think so alike and have the same utility function. The best signal is not an expensive or surprising gift, but the will and ability to maximize the other’s utility like it is one’s own. The best relationship is not just the double coincidence of wants, but the merging of two people’s wants into one. Somehow, the Economic Man found the right Economic Woman that he can please just by following his heart.
Maybe love is rational after all.

Last week, the people of Massachusetts found that the United States Attorney General Eric H. Holder had approved a motion to pursue the death penalty in the case of the Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
Many local politicians came out in support (or at least acceptance) of the attorney general’s decision, much to the chagrin of Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi, who correctly found this compliance to be mere “timidity.” 
The Tsarnaev case is a federal one, and as such should not rely on the standards of justice specific to Massachusetts. Imagine the opposite scenario: a similar case occurs in Texas, the state that leads the U.S. in executions. This hypothetical case ends up in federal court where, based on the evidence, the attorney general decides not to pursue the death penalty. This decision rests solely in him or her. It would be absurd for the people of Texas—especially those closely impacted by the crime who are likely far from impartial—to decry the decision and demand the death penalty. This is simply not their jurisdiction. 
Since 1988, the Attorney General has approved seeking the death penalty in 492 cases. Ultimately, during that time period only 190 death penalty cases were brought to trial; of those, only 34 percent were sentenced to death. 
Given these statistics, the attorney general’s decision is hardly surprising; it is far from a guarantee that Tsarnaev will end up on death row. This has not stopped people from jumping to conclusions about what his sentence should be.
While these people have every right to express their opinions, we must acknowledge that we, as a society, are perpetuating a culture of decision-making without the facts. 
The Tsarnaev case is just one of a great number of criminal cases that demonstrate a concerning carelessness on the part of lay citizens who are not informed about all the details of a case but nevertheless jump to conclusions and attempt to influence the justice system. 
The legal consequences for this general attitude are myriad. Particularly, it makes it difficult to find impartial jurors who lack preconceptions about the defendant. It also creates an environment where potential jurors are confused about courtroom procedures, such as innocence until proven guilty, or the concept of reasonable doubt. It also diverts attention to futile attempts to influence court proceedings, when such passions could better be spent on legislative efforts. 
Another recent example is the tragic case of Trayvon Martin. The Twitter hashtag #IfIEverSeeZimmerman made an appearance on the popular social media outlet after Zimmerman’s “not guilty” verdict was announced. Zimmerman’s acquittal, which many believe was racially motivated, was no doubt difficult for Martin’s friends and family. However, this hardly excuses the behavior present on social media, with some calling for the murder of Zimmerman.
This mob mentality is not limited to cases in the courts. Consider the aftermath of Dylan Farrow’s accusations that Woody Allen molested her.
 
Eric Sasson of the New Republic wrote an excellent piece on the “knee-jerk” reaction of many online columnists—and by extension, the bloggers and amateur commentators who reign over social media. I believe Farrow’s case is tragic, and regardless of what is the truth—whether she was molested by Allen or whether she was brainwashed by her mother Mia Farrow—it seems clear that she needs love and support. 
But those who write so firmly agains Woody Allen forget the fact that an expert medical team concluded at the time that Farrow had not been molested. And the people who call for a trial of Allen forget that the statute of limitations is long over. Perhaps, one could argue that the statute of limitations should be extended for child abuse cases; however, this should not occur on a case-by-case basis, and certainly should not occur retroactively. 
Of course, public opinion is an important aspect of democracy and can rightly be targeted in order to change laws that the public does not agree with. The Massachusetts death penalty was originally banned on constitutional grounds by the Commonwealth’s Supreme Judicial Court, and legislative efforts have continually blocked reinstatement of the death penalty since its prohibition in 1984. If people’s passions are aroused enough, there is potential to change and improve the criminal justice system. But we should be wary of channeling these feelings into an Internet witch hunt in an attempt to ruin a person’s life without regard for evidence of basic legal protocols. 
The most tragic example of the social media kangaroo court involves Sunil Tripathi, a young Brown student who was falsely accused of orchestrating the Boston bombing. 
Harsh words written with haste and no thought swarmed his Facebook page, and his family was harassed by police and the media. Ultimately his name was cleared—only for Sunil to be found dead in Providence, RI.
Of course we all have a right to free speech. However, we should be mindful that this right comes with the responsibility to use it wisely, for greater transparency, not greater obfuscation.

In the beginning of the 19th century, it was not uncommon for skies to blacken with flocks of passenger pigeons, some containing millions of birds. But despite their overwhelming numbers, the last living passenger pigeon, Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914.
On Saturday, the Harvard Museum of Natural History opened a new exhibit to mark the 100th anniversary of Martha’s death and the extinction of the passenger pigeon. The exhibit, which was curated with help from a student at the College, seeks to encourage discussion about conservation in the U.S.
“It was a shock of an ending,” said Kerry M. Flynn ’14, a Crimson News and Design editor, when talking about the extinction of the passenger pigeon. Flynn helped the museum staff assemble the exhibit after reaching out to them last fall to see how they were planning to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the bird’s extinction.
Flynn, an environmental studies and public policy concentrator, discovered her interest in the passenger pigeon during her sophomore year, when she wrote a paper about its extinction. She said that she looked at the matter through a Harvard lens, researching efforts at the University to analyze the potential extinction of the passenger pigeon due to human activity.
“It was the first time American scientists realized people could cause extinction,” said Jennifer L. Berglund, the science and culture exhibit developer at the Natural History Museum.
The passenger pigeon was hunted in overwhelming numbers, and the deforestation of land destroyed its habitat. Being a gregarious animal, the passenger pigeon could not survive when the flocks began to dwindle. The populations were almost completely wiped out in the last two decades of the 19th century, drastically changing the American landscape.
 
The death of the passenger pigeon started conversation about conservation work in the U.S., which led to legislation to protect wildlife, like the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.
The museum will also launch a self-guided tour to explain the other animals in the museum’s galleries. The tour will include extinct species, endangered species, and success stories, animals that were endangered but are no longer.
“Museums like this are a place where you can tell this story in a very real way,” said Jane Pickering, executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. With 72 specimens, Harvard has one of the world’s largest collections of taxidermied passenger pigeons.
Harvard is not the only institution remembering the passenger pigeon this year. Yale, the Smithsonian, and other museums around in the U.S. are putting on exhibits about the species.
Pickering said she is hoping that remembering the passenger pigeon will draw attention species that are facing extinction.

A semester after several humanities departments joined together to offer broad introductory classes in the field, students and faculty members offered a largely positive evaluation of the courses, which aimed to be experimental and interdisciplinary.
Staffed by professors from a variety of disciplines, Humanities 11a: “Frameworks: The Art of Looking” and Humanities 11b: “Frameworks: The Art of Listening,” were offered for the first time fall.  Humanities 11c: “Frameworks: The Art of Reading” is being offered by humanities professor Homi K. Bhabha this semester.
The professors who developed the curricula for these introductory courses said that the classes aim to offer students a broad approach to the humanities that stresses the everyday relevance of the discipline, an effort which they said they hope to expand with more courses in the works.
“[T]he hope was to make a set of classes that really provide an opening point that is not tied specifically to a specific discipline or department,” said Jennifer L. Roberts,  a professor in the History of Art and Architecture department who co-taught “The Art of Looking,” noting that course instructors sought to tailor the classes for a changing student body with less early exposure to the humanities.
Several instructors said the introductory courses, which were targeted at both prospective humanities concentrators and students in non-humanities departments, sought to emphasize the applicability of the humanities to the broader world.
“Listening is around us, we do it all the time, we’re doing it right now, and it’s so fundamental that we don’t even think about it,” said Alexander Rehding, the chair of the Music Department and one of the instructors for “The Art of Listening.”
Roberts said that her class seemed to succeed in engaging students who had experience in a variety of disciplines.
“A large percentage of the students were people who weren’t planning on going into the humanities, that are statisticians or computer science people,” she said. “They were some of the most enthusiastic participants in the course and, in many ways, some of the most positive feedback from what we could tell from the Q [Guide] evaluations.”
Roberts added that she was pleased with the relatively high enrollment of the course and its favorable reception in the Q Guide.
“We were very happy to see in the evaluations again and again that this class changed the way people looked at the world,” she said
All of the students interviewed for this article said that they generally enjoyed the Humanities 11 courses they enrolled in.
“It was a very experimental course. They did a lot of things with section, not a traditional lecture, lecture, section course, but I had a very positive experience taking the class,” said  Luis Gallardo ’14, a Government concentrator.
Darius J. Altman ’17 said that while he does not intend to concentrate in the humanities, he appreciated how “The Art of Looking” offered him a new framework for looking at everyday problems.
“The instructors and TFs highlighted the ability to really critically analyze something and give a nuanced argument—abilities that are sometimes more valuable than a lot of ostensibly more practical disciplines like economics or hard sciences,” he said, adding later, “A humanities approach is a lot more relevant and useful than people think it might be because you talk every day and you’re not using calculus every day.”
“The Art of Looking” received an overall Q rating of 4.27, while “The Art of Listening” garnered a 3.73.

Members of the Undergraduate Council discussed a proposal to ease the transition of freshmen into upperclassmen Houses, provided feedback to guests from the Office of Career Services, and approved legislation specifying the roles of different Council members in their general meeting Sunday evening.
Rob C. Gunzenhauser ’15, a member of the Adams House Committee, first spoke before the UC to solicit feedback for an event designed to better integrate freshmen moving into upperclassmen Houses.
“We can do a better job of coming up with ways to make sure [undergraduates]…are at home more quickly than [they] would be otherwise,” he said.
Each year, freshmen are randomly assigned to various Houses in the middle of the spring semester. Gunzenhauser presented a plan that members of several House Committees are working on that would  allow students to interact with members of their respective houses after Housing Day.
While the specifics have not been completely generated, Gunzenhauser and UC members discussed the idea of a field day competition in the Spring, where freshmen either would pick or be assigned a student who currently lives in their assigned House and compete against rival House neighborhoods in outdoor games.
Afterwards, OCS Director Robin Mount and Benny Belvin II, assistant director of career services, both spoke before the Council about misconceptions students might have about the OCS and how their employees can improve communication with students.
 
After discussing these matters, the UC shifted its focus to voting on internal affairs.
In a bylaw brought before the UC by Rules Committee Chair Kevin H. Xiong ’17, the UC specified responsibilities of the social chairs, two of which were elected last week.
In a similar procedural move, UC representatives approved an update to a portion of their bylaws that now outlines the duties of the Student Faculty Committee director.
Finally, members of the Council passed what they named the Executive Board Voting Membership Update Act.
Under this amendment, the Rules Committee chair and the Student-Faculty Committee director, along with the previously specified Council members, will be allowed to vote in executive board meetings.
Prior to the law, the UC president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer, as well as the chairs of standing committees constituted the voting power of the Executive Board, which meets weekly and holds all executive authority of the Council.
In addition to these matters, the UC also approved another wave of student grants for the coming semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Serious crime in Cambridge reached a 50-year low during 2013, according to the Cambridge Police Department’s annual crime review, which was released last week.  In each of the past three years, serious crime in the city has dropped—2013 saw an 8 percent decline from 2012.
 
In a press release, Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas applauded the news.
 
“The men and women of the Cambridge Police Department, our public and private partners, and the citizens of our city should take great pride in their individual and collective efforts to make our city a safe and healthy community,” he said.
 
The term “Serious Crime,” as used by the Cambridge Police Department, refers to any reported crime that falls under the FBI Part I Crime Index.  According to the FBI’s website, the Part I Crime Index refers to crime in eight categories: “murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault...burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.” The FBI discontinued its own use of the Crime Index in June 2004
 
Haas emphasized the importance of focusing on a wider swath of crime in the released statement.
 
“While the FBI Part I Crime Index is an important measure of crime—and represents nearly 300 fewer victims of serious crime in Cambridge this year—we continue to focus on a much broader range of social harm issues to prevent the victimization of people in Cambridge and improve the overall quality-of-life in this community,” he said.
 
Part I Crime is divided into two categories. 10.2 percent of the serious crime reported in 2013 was violent crime, while 89.8 percent qualified as property crime. Violent crime in 2013 dropped 21 percent from 2012.
 
The Cambridge Police Department could not be reached for comment for this story, and a spokesperson for the Harvard University Police Department declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There is a lot to Laverne Cox,” said Laverne Cox herself at the start of a student-led question-and-answer session at Farkas Hall on Monday afternoon, as the actress launched a conversation about the intersection of different identities and their importance to understanding her and transgender issues more generally.
The “Orange is the New Black” actress, who is the first openly transgender female to ever have a recurring role on television, spoke about her personal experiences and about larger topics within the trans community at an event that drew so many people that many had to remain standing.
“I sit here this afternoon, a proud transgender woman, an African-American transgender woman from a working-class background, raised by a single mother. I sit here an artist and an actress, a sister and a daughter, and I believe it’s important to name the various intersecting components of my multiple identities, because I’m not just one thing,” said Cox, as she explained that there is much more to the request “tell us about yourself.”
 
Cox highlighted the importance of allowing transgender people to tell their own stories, a point echoed by W. Powell Eddins ’16, one of the event organizers and political co-chair of Queer Students and Allies.
 
“We needed to stop letting cisgender people speak for trans people. We need to have trans people come speak for their own voices,” Eddins said. “That’s why I brought Laverne—I thought it was really necessary.”
 
Eddins added that Cox is a positive advocate for trans issues and through her visit was able to increase exposure of such topics at Harvard, which, Eddins said, despite its diversity, still lacks exposure to transgender people and transgender issues.
“Walking down the street is a contested act for many trans women of color,” Cox said, speaking on one such topic, violence against transgender women. In the question and answer segment, Cox also touched on discrimination against transgender people in the justice system, the role of activism in changing inequality, the portrayal of her character on “Orange is the New Black,” and media portrayals of transgender people in general.
Commenting on her visit to Harvard, Cox said that it is essential for conversations on transgender issues to take place at Harvard, whose students have the potential to be the leaders of tomorrow and to affect policies that might help or harm transgender people.
“I think it’s important to have these conversations in privileged spaces,” Cox said. “I think it’s important for those with privilege to critically interrogate that privilege.”
Amanda D. Bradley ’15, who attended the event, said that she appreciated hearing Cox's perspective.
“She’s probably one of my favorite Harvard speakers, since I’ve been here,” Bradley said. “She was very blunt and honest about very real issues concerning race, gender, sexuality, and the intersectionality of all these things.”

CORRECTION: Feb. 25, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Laverne Cox is the first openly transgender woman to have a recurring role on television. In fact, Cox is the first openly transgender African American woman to star in and produce her own television show, but is not the first to have a recurring role.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
When Buoy Lee, owner and founder of the Hong Kong Chinese restaurant, first walked by the property on 1238 Mass. Ave. in 1954, she could sense its potential. 
“I thought to myself—jeez, that place has feng shui,” Lee said.
This week, as the Kong, as the restaurant is affectionately known among students, prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary, Lee and her family reflected on the growth of the business and its landmark status in Harvard Square. 
“We are constantly reinvesting in the restaurant,” Paul Lee, Buoy Lee’s son and restaurant manager, said. “I saw it as they built a legacy and I’m just trying to build on that.” 
Although Buory Lee was around 20 years old when she emigrated from her native Canton, China, to the United States, she managed to make the restaurant a success, eventually opening up a second location downtown at Faneuil hall. 
“I came over here, I didn’t know nothing, I was so scared when I came,” Buory Lee said. “I was born in China poor—no money, no nothing. That’s why when I came here I didn’t mind working hard.” 
According to Paul Lee, Buory Lee and her late husband invested in infrastructure like sprinklers that proved to be beneficial in the long term. 
That vision has helped the Hong Kong restaurant continue to grow over the past 60 years. This week, the Lee family celebrated both the Chinese New Year and another special achievement—a “Cornerstone of Harvard Square Award” from the Harvard Square Business Association. 
“They are a wonderful family, a terrific landmark, wonderful community partners, and long time members of the Business Association,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
Although Paul Lee cannot recall what month specifically marks the commemoration of their founding, the family plans to formally celebrate the occasion in the spring. 
After originally operating a laundry shop in Brighton, Buory Lee and her husband decided to open the Hong Kong with three other partners, who no longer hold a share in the business. 
Although Harvard Square was not the best business environment in those days, Buory Lee said, she predicted that the Square would improve. 
“At that time nobody would walk around,” Buory Lee said. “Later on it will be a very busy place.” 
Despite slow foot traffic, the Kong did not wait long to experience success. 
“First when we opened it was very busy, but later on the business dropped,” she added.
According to Paul Lee, the Lee family went from bank to bank until they were able to secure a loan and buy out the other partners around 1956. 
During the 1960’s, Cambridge landowner Bertha Cohen expressed interest in buying the building. However, Buory Lee did her best to persuade Cohen not to buy the building. 
“Every week we’d cook lobster and white rice [to bring over to Cohen],” Buory Lee said. Whether it was the lobster or Lee’s persistence, Cohen held off from purchasing the building, and in 1970 the Lees finally bought the property outright.
After securing ownership of the building, the Lee family continued to work hard in order to make a living to support their three kids, Paul Lee said. 
“For us this was a real livelihood, this is how they put food on the table,” he said. “It’s almost like their work rather than their passion.” 
Throughout the Kong’s history, the restaraunt has developed close ties to customers and the community. The restaurant even has a positive reputation with Chinese tourists, according to Buory Lee. 
“They say our food is very good,” she said.
For many Harvard students of all ages, the Kong’s legacy has been as a typical weekend destination for hanging out and for a late night meal.
“The Kong is a classic late night spot,” R. Christopher Read II '17 said. “Either coming from late night festivities or preparing for a late night of studying, the Kong fulfills both roles.” 
Daniel J. Rhodes '01 spent many nights with members of the Harvard Marching Band at the Kong and has been a frequenter of the restaurant ever since. 
“I got to know the staff there,” said Rhodes. “I’ve been going there for 15 years now, and it’s nice to see that it’s still there.” 
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67 also has many memories of going to the restaurant as a student. 
“My favorite part? It’s got to be a scorpion bowl,” Dingman said. “I have so many memories of going there with a group of friends usually late at night after some other activity.”

Law students might want to consider taking classes on accounting, corporate finance, and financial statement analysis, according to a survey of major law firms published last week by several faculty at Harvard Law School.
 
The study—which was conducted by Law School professors John C. Coates IV, Jesse M. Fried, and Kathryn E. Spier—found that 83 percent of the practicing attorneys interviewed believe students should take “Accounting and Financial Reporting” classes. Only 10 percent of attorneys, however, suggested taking a class entitled “Leadership in Law Firms.”
 
“The large law firms that hire Law School students have always generated most of their revenues by assisting businesses in structuring and litigating over complex financial transactions,” Fried wrote in an email. “What's different today, perhaps, is that law firms are under increasing pressure from clients to be more efficient, and so the bars for hiring and promoting associates have been raised.”
 
Fried and his collaborators asked 124 practicing attorneys at 11 major law firms to rate several Harvard Law classes on a scale from one, indicating “not useful at all” to five, indicating “extremely useful.” Classes in administrative law, constitutional law, and labor law all scored below 3.5.
 
With a score of 4.61, the Law School’s class on corporations received the highest score. Classes on “Securities Regulation” and “Mergers and Acquisitions” both received scores over 4.
 
Mark A. Weber, the assistant dean for career services at the Law School, said that students should not let the study go unnoticed.
 
“I think the survey will provide students who are pursuing legal opportunities in the private sector with helpful information when selecting their courses,” Weber wrote in an email. “Taking courses in accounting and financial statement analysis and corporate finance will serve students well irrespective of their chosen practice areas.”
 
Some students, however, do not appear to focus on employer preferences while selecting courses.
 
“I think that there are other things on my resume that would speak to these skills,” said first year law student Salome Viljoen, who entered the Law School with a background in mathematics and finance. “I think that I mostly want to get experience and exposure to things that I don’t think I could get outside of a law school context.”
 
Yet other students already seem to be following the advice offered by the study.
 
“I wanted to be marketable to future employers…so I tried to choose classes that would make me more attractive and I also tried to choose classes that would make entering into the working world easier,” said Natalie A. Perez, a third year at the Law School.
 
The Law School offers a broad range of accounting and finance courses. According to Fried, enrollment in those classes has steadily grown over the years.
 
Spier also highlighted how the Law School has designed a strong base of courses on economics and finance. According to Spier, introductory business methods classes at the Law School have proved particularly popular.
 
Perez, however, noted that some law students may be more reluctant to take finance classes.
 
“I don’t think most of my colleagues want to take these courses, but that’s just a perception of the people I interact with everyday,” Perez said.
 
Still, Perez was quick to point out that she felt that economics classes were intellectually interesting and pragmatic.
 
“I really liked my corporate finance class,” she said.

Though the protests in Ukraine have waned over the past few days, Harvard scholars said during a panel on Monday that the country still has some work to be done in order to repair its democracy.
 
“The activists need to keep pushing, and the new government shouldn’t go on a Miss World tour first either,” Olga Onuch, a fellow at the Ukrainian Research Center, said.
 
The title of the event, “Why Is Kyiv Burning? The Turn to Violence in Ukraine’s Protest Movement and Its Political and Geostrategic Implications,” underwent three name changes as the crisis in Ukraine fluctuated, according to Lubomyr Hajda, the associate director of the Ukrainian Research Center.
 
However, Hajda added that even by the time of the seminar the title was still not an accurate reflection of rapidly-changing crisis.
 
Political turmoil has raged in the country since now former President Viktor Yanukovich refused to sign the country’s association agreement with the European Union. Currently, their parliament has deposed the president, and a transitional government is being formed.
 
In addition to Onuch and Hajda, the seminar also included discussion from Timothy J. Colton, the chair of the government department and a scholar of Russian politics, Jaroslaw M. Domanski, a fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, and Nadiya V. Kravets, a fellow at the Ukrainian Research Institute.
 
Many of the panelists focused on dispelling myths about the crisis that they said were propagated in Western media. Onuch, who conducted numerous interviews and polls during the protests, said statistics showed that the protesting population was not made up of mostly young people from western regions of the country, contrary to what much of the mass media reported.
 
“Middle-aged and older protesters have not been presented well in analyses today,” Onuch said. “In addition, many key protest leaders were from the center and eastern portions of the country.”
 
With Yanukovich’s government now out of office, the rest of the seminar centered on what lies in store for Ukraine, especially in terms of foreign relations.
 
“Foreign policy is what fueled the protests in the first place, and there’s a new force for the country’s foreign policy: the people,” Kravets said. “I hope Ukrainian policy will become more procedure-based and not oligarchy-based.”
 
Domanski, who worked with the EU’s delegation to Ukraine, emphasized the need for the Union’s involvement in the country now.
 
“The EU inability to play hardball means it entered the geopolitical game with Russia without the necessary tools,” he said. “Now, going forward Ukraine needs economic assistance and political will from the EU.”
 
Colton also stressed the importance of Russia’s continued financial support for Ukraine.
 
“Russia has sustained a major loss, and it doesn’t quite know what to do,” he said. “If the Russians are thinking straight, they will continue to give money to Ukraine even with Yanukovich gone in order to maintain the country’s stability and their influence in it.”

Princeton’s leading scorer on the season, junior Blake Dietrick, may have notched only two points on the night, but the Tigers (17-6, 8-1 Ivy) found another source of scoring to slip past the Harvard women’s basketball team, 69-64, on Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
Princeton guard Annie Tarakchian came up big when it mattered, hitting back-to-back threes with 10 minutes to go in the second half to give the Tigers a three-point lead. The sophomore was previously only 6-for-29 from downtown this year.
Tarakchian finished the game 3-for-4 from behind the arc and with 15 total points—including the six in less than a minute that gave Princeton control of the game down the closing stretch.
The Crimson (17-7, 7-3) now sits in third place in the Ivy League. The Killer P’s once again proved deadly as the two losses—the first time in over 20 years the team has lost both Ivy games in a home weekend—have dampened Harvard’s hopes for an Ancient Eight title.
For a chance at their first title since 2008, the Crimson will need to win out while hoping for Penn to drop one of its five remaining games and for the now Ivy-leading Tigers to drop two of their final five contests.
Coming off of Friday’s 63-50 defeat at the hands of Penn, co-captain Christine Clark was looking to score early and often against the Tigers. The senior guard scored five of the Crimson’s first seven points on her way to a 14-point first half. Clark finished the game with 23 points, and after this weekend has now moved into 4th place on Harvard’s all-time scoring list with 1,623 points.
Clark and junior forward Temi Fagbenle powered the Crimson offense to an early 15-7 lead for the Crimson in a first half that was marked by big runs for both teams. Princeton took its first lead, 17-15, midway through the first half behind buckets from senior forward Kristen Helmstetter and sophomore forward Alex Wheatley.
Five straight points from senior Jasmine Evans helped the Crimson spark a run of its own, rattling off 11 straight to make it 26-17 and to force a Tiger timeout. The teams entered the locker rooms at halftime with Harvard clinging to a three-point lead over Princeton in a low-scoring first half.
“I am quite shocked that we were off offensively [both tonight and last night],” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t know why we are struggling to put the ball in the basket…. It was uncharacteristic for us.”
Though the Crimson only shot 36 percent from the field in the first, its defense, especially on Dietrick, was the key to its first half lead. Dietrick entered the game averaging 17.3 points per game, but was 0-for-7 after the first half of action and ended the game 1-for-13 in 38 minutes.
“We had [Dietrick’s] number,” senior guard Melissa Mullins said. “We knew what she wanted to do. Not only do Jasmine and I match up against her on defense, but we also switch a lot on defense. Shutting her down was really a team effort.”
Even with Dietrick continuing to struggle throughout the second half, Princeton was able to rally behind a strong performance from Helmstetter, who finished with 17 points while shooting 50 percent from the field.
After a back-and-forth first 10 minutes of the second half, Tarakchian’s back-to-back three-pointers marked a significant turning point in the game.
As Princeton stretched its lead to 53-48 with eight minutes to go, Mullins went down with an ankle injury and had to limp to the sideline for medical assistance. The senior would check back in after an Evans three and, though she was clearly still hobbled by the injury, hit a nice layup inside to cut the Tiger lead to one.
Mullins was fouled on Harvard’s next possession, and she immediately subbed out after missing both free throws, still limping noticeably.Soon after Mullins went back to the bench with the injury, Fagbenle had to join her on the sideline as she picked up her fifth foul, and Princeton took full advantage of the situation as it pushed its lead back to six with four minutes remaining.
Clark gave the Tigers one last challenge, putting in four straight points to tie the game at 61, but five misses for Harvard in the final two minutes doomed any hope of a comeback.
“We beat them in every single category,” Delaney-Smith said. “In every single category except the foul line, and that was the difference. I am proud of my team, and I am disappointed for them.”

Just three matches into the Harvard women’s tennis team’s contest against 11th-ranked Clemson this weekend, things were looking somewhat bleak. After losing the doubles point and two quick singles matches, the Crimson was just one point away from a loss, on the road, against a top-15 opponent.
 
Harvard (6-2) fought back, however, rattling off four straight wins to take a stunning upset of Clemson (7-2). With three of the Crimson’s top four singles players battling back from first set losses to earn must-win victories, Harvard managed to pull off a comeback in every sense of the word.
 
“I’m on cloud nine,” freshman June Lee said. “I’m so happy right now. It’s very encouraging and motivating. Now that we’ve beaten such a highly-ranked school, we know our capability and what we can do, and it’s amazing.”
 
With the Crimson down 3-0 and struggling early in the remaining singles matches, it was Lee who managed to turn the momentum in Harvard’s favor. The freshman easily dispatched Clemson’s Romy Koelzer, currently ranked 54th in the nation, in a 6-2, 6-4 match to give the Crimson their first win on the day.
 
“The girl I played, she liked to hit really flat,” Lee said. “I knew that if I kept mixing it up, like if I hit two high balls and then two flat balls, or two angles and kept the rallies longer, she would miss or get frustrated. And she was very frustrated, she was missing a lot, and I just stayed positive and worked each point.”
 
The focus then fell to the three singles matches still in progress, where freshmen Spencer Liang and Monica Lin, and sophomore Amy He were all forced to battle back from dropping the first set at first, second, and fourth singles, respectively.
 
Down 5-3 in the second set of her contest, Liang was the first to add another tally to Harvard’s total. The freshman ace stayed calm to force and then win a tiebreaker in the second set, and then quickly regained her form after dropping the first two games of the third set to win the match with a 6-2 victory in the final frame.
 
“We were all feeling the pressure,” Liang said. “I of course felt pressure in my match because if one of us didn’t perform and just embrace the pressure, then we would have lost the match. But we all handled it really well, and I think that coming back just shows a lot about all of our characters.”
 
Monica Lin kept the Crimson’s comeback attempt going, earning her own 2-6, 7-6, 6-4 win in the second spot to even the match up at 3-all with just one match still in progress. All eyes then turned to court four, as He and Clemson sophomore Yuilynn Miao fought to earn the deciding point. He rose to the challenge, taking the second and third sets easily to give Harvard the final tally.
 
“Amy did so great,” Liang said. “Even though she also didn’t come out playing as well as she’d like, she stepped up her game and let loose. [Miao] was tough, she was very consistent, she was hitting balls all over the court, but Amy just stayed patient and she kept playing her game….She stepped in and kept being aggressive.”
 
The Crimson gave Clemson a run for their money early in the doubles matches but was unable to come away with the point. Harvard’s No. 2 team of Lee and junior Sylvia Li dropped a quick match in an 8-1 decision, but He and sophomore Amanda Lin came out on top of a back-and-forth contest at third doubles to knot the score up at 1-1. At first doubles, Liang and Monica Lin dropped an 8-5 match to give Clemson the doubles point.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what was a crucial weekend for Harvard men’s volleyball (5-4, 4-1 EIVA), the team looked to pick up big victories at St. Francis and Penn State and maintain its unbeaten start in the EIVA. But after starting the road trip with a 3-1 win versus St. Francis (8-5, 3-2), the Crimson men faltered, losing in straight sets to Penn State (12-2, 5-0) to break their four-game win streak.
The Nittany Lions remain atop the EIVA, with Harvard and St Francis right behind them in a hotly-contested conference.
PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 0
In a battle between the two remaining undefeated teams of the league for first place, the No. 12 Nittany Lions came out on top in a 25-19, 25-15, and 25-22 straight-set victory. The Crimson offense was smothered, managing only a .065 hitting percentage throughout the game and a -.029 hitting percentage in the second set.
“Penn State is a really big team that was able to block us well,” said sophomore outside hitter Branden Clemens. “It was tough to get the kills we usually get. We always want to beat Penn State because they are always ranked number one in the conference.”
Penn State grabbed a lead early in the first set thanks to a 9-5 run that turned a close 7-7 game to the Nittany Lions’ favor, gaining an advantage it would never relinquish. The second set followed a similar trend, as the home team took the lead from the first point and held it for the entire set.
The third set was more competitive, with the Crimson keeping the set close down the stretch—the Nittany Lions were never able to distance themselves by more than three points. However, a game-leading 11th kill by Penn State outside hitter Nick Goodell would end the game and claim victory for the home favorites.
Despite the loss, the team was able to use this game as a learning experience as well as a way to measure where it is at performance wise.
“It was a different type of volleyball,” co-captain Nick Madden said. “It’s more of a pass and set kind of game as opposed to a scrappy type of volleyball when you play against teams like these. It was a good learning experience.”
HARVARD 3 ST. FRANCIS 1
Harvard claimed a 3-1 road victory at St. Francis to begin its weekend slate. After starting with a 19-25 loss in the first set, the Crimson stormed back at DeGol Arena to take the next three sets 25-15, 25-18, and 25-19 to defeat the Red Flash.
Leading 6-4 in the second set, a kill by senior middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper sparked a 6-0 run by Harvard to go up 12-4, a lead that proved to be insurmountable for the home team. Harvard carried this form through the third set, before briefly falling behind at the start of the final set. But a service error by St. Francis would spark a rally by the Crimson men, which ultimately resulted in victory.
Madden, junior outside hitter DJ White and freshman outside hitter Casey White recorded double-digit kills with 14, 17 and 10 respectively to lead a balanced Harvard offense to a total of 51 kills. Madden also recorded 13 digs to complete his fifth career double-double.
Complementing its offensive performance, the Crimson squad put up a tough defense as well. St. Francis committed 26 attack errors compared to only 12 by Harvard, in addition to being held to a.189 kill percentage. The Red Flash was also limited to a .182 hitting percentage compared to .312 by the Crimson.
“The second set we got on top and blocked well,” Madden said. “The whole team in general really picked it up on defense after the first set.”
While not the smoothest of victories for Harvard, the team used this game as an opportunity to learn more about its style of play.
“That first game came out flat,” Clemens said. “We didn’t go out with energy and we were not entirely there mentally. We learned that we always need to play as hard as we can no matter who the opponent is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the final weekend of regular season play, the No. 5/5 Harvard women’s ice hockey team had a pair of titles on the line. Road tests at Yale and Brown would determine if the Crimson (21-4-4, 16-3-3 ECAC) could lock up the Ivy League Championship as well as the No. 1 seed in the ECAC tournament.
Unfortunately for Harvard, a tie against the Bulldogs (8-14-7, 6-9-7) on Friday evening was not enough for the ECAC regular season conference championship. The disappointing 3-3 finish meant that the Crimson would finish second in ECAC league play. But Harvard quickly rebounded the following afternoon with a 3-1 win over the Bears (4-20-5, 3-16-3) to take home the Ancient Eight title.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
Even though the ECAC title had eluded the team, the Crimson came out firing in its second contest of the weekend hoping to take home the Ivy League championship.
“We’ve been harping on it all year that we need to play a full 60 minutes of hockey,” sophomore forward Miye D’Oench said. “It’s not enough to just come out flying or finish strong, but you have to play the whole game uniformly well. Coming off the Yale tie, we wanted to play a full 60 minutes against Brown, and I think we came pretty close.”
A quick goal by D’Oench just two minutes into the game gave Harvard a 1-0 lead. The Crimson built on that momentum with back-to-back goals in the span of thirty seconds by senior Elizabeth Parker in the second frame to give Harvard a comfortable cushion heading into the third.
Freshman goaltender Brianna Laing, who has split time between the pipes this season with sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer, recorded 30 saves in the contest.
The win, along with a loss by Cornell that afternoon, meant that the Crimson would take home its second-straight Ancient Eight title.
“We get to put a year up on that [Ivy League Championship] banner,” D’Oench said. “A lot of teams don’t get to do that, so that’s pretty special.”
 
HARVARD 3, YALE 3
 
A quick goal by Parker just four minutes into the contest put the Crimson up against the Bulldogs, but Harvard saw its advantage vanish by the end of the period. Two power play goals by Yale gave the Bulldogs a 2-1 lead after the first frame.
“We had a very, very fast start,” D’Oench said. “I thought we were all over them for the first five or ten minutes. Unfortunately, we got two penalties that cost us. They were able to pop in a few quick goals, and that kind of changed the flow of the game.”
A tripping penalty on freshman defender Briana Mastel gave the Bulldogs the man advantage, and Yale needed only five seconds to capitalize on the opportunity. The Bulldogs won the ensuing faceoff and freshman defender Taylor Marchin drove the puck straight into the net to tie up the game.
With less than two minutes left in the first period, Yale again found itself with a power play opportunity. Sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer put up four straight saves to kill most of the penalty, but forward Jackie Raines netted one with less than 30 seconds to go in the power play to put the Bulldogs up, 2-1.
“After the first period was a great time to regroup as a team, go back to the locker room, talk about what we need to work on better, and come out in the second period and execute that,” senior Elizabeth Parker said. “In the second and third periods, we definitely improved our play and overcame some adversity that we had faced.”
The Crimson gave up another goal five minutes into the second frame, leaving the team in a 3-1 deficit. But D’Oench closed the gap with a goal of her own 11 minutes into the period off an assist from classmate Jessica Harvey and junior Sarah Edney.
Harvard outshot Yale, 12-6, on the period but could not find the equalizer. Entering the third period just a goal back, the Crimson was finally able to tie it up with 1:16 left to play in regulation when freshman forward Sydney Daniels slipped one by goaltender Jaimie Leonoff off an assist from Hillary Crowe.
Harvard looked desperately for a goal in overtime but could not capitalize, and the game ended in a tie. Unfortunately, the Crimson needed a win to claim the ECAC regular season conference championship and the No. 1 seed in the postseason tournament.
“Anytime you score with less than two minutes left in a game to tie it up, you’re pretty happy about that,” D’Oench said. “[But] to be honest, it was a real stinger, because it meant that we didn’t win the regular season for ECAC. That’s pretty big, not only for pride, but also the No. 1 seed gets to host the playoffs. I’m very proud of us for climbing out of that hole, but at the same time, we needed the win. That didn’t feel too good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team travelled south this weekend to open its season against tough competition in Fort Meyers, Florida.
Florida Gulf Coast 3, Harvard 1
In its final game of the weekend, the Crimson stayed close with the Eagles, but could not convert.
“It’s always tough not playing for six months and then playing some really good teams, but I think we found our stride as a team and [can] only progress from here,” junior infielder Emily Gusse said. “We played two really good teams in Florida Golf Coast and Arkansas, and we had a really good shot at winning both.”
Both teams were able to score in their opening looks at the plate, but Harvard’s bats went quiet after that, with four hits scattered over the next six innings.
Florida Gulf Coast crossed the plate twice in the bottom of the fifth to solidify the victory.
Junior pitcher Laura Ricciardone threw for the Crimson, giving up five hits, walking four, and striking out four.
Arkansas 9, Harvard 4
Facing a strong SEC team was too much for the Crimson to handle as the team dropped its first game on Sunday to the Razorbacks.
Freshman pitcher Taylor Cabe got the start for Harvard and held Arkansas to four runs over the first five innings but then surrendered five in the bottom of the sixth inning.
“Taylor’s great, she’s going to have an awesome career here,” Gusse said. “She has grit. She got the start and the complete game against Arkansas, who’s a crazy tough team to pitch because they have some huge girls who can hit the ball a long way.”
The Crimson’s offense came out strong in the first couple innings, scoring three runs in the first and one in the second. Those proved to be their only runs of the game as the team was held scoreless for the remainder of the matchup.
Harvard 7, North Dakota 4
The Crimson was able to look to its offense for Saturday’s victory against North Dakota.
Harvard recorded 10 hits in the game, half of which were for extra bases.
The biggest scoring inning came in the fifth when the Crimson crossed the plate four times on five hits and a UND error. The highlight of the inning was a double by senior outfielder Shelbi Olson that scored two runs.
“We have a ton of really great hitters on the team,” junior infielder Adrienne Hume said. “Once we all get in synch and have a few more games under our belt and play this upcoming weekend we’re really going to be unstoppable.”
Harvard tacked on three more runs in the top of the seventh inning on hits from Gusse, freshman catcher Lindsey Hagburg, junior catcher Katherine Applebe, and freshman pitcher Savannah Bradley.
Villanova 2, Harvard 1
Harvard’s defense was able to hold the Wildcats’ 10 hits to only two runs but could not muster enough offensive momentum to win the game overall.
Cabe started the game for the Crimson and pitched all seven innings, striking out seven and walking only one Villanova batter.
The Wildcats were held in the first inning after recording back to back this, but a string of three hits in the top of the second led to a run.
Harvard broke through the shutout in the fifth inning. With two on base from walks and two outs, Gusse singled, sending sophomore outfielder Zoe Galindo home to score.
The final inning of the game saw Villanova break the tie. With their leadoff hitter hit by a pitch, Wildcats second baseman Chase Snell belted a double into center field. A throwing error allowed the runner to score and put Villanova ahead.
Harvard 3, Eastern Michigan 0
In its opening game of the season, Harvard was able to keep its opponents bats at bay behind the strong arm of Ricciardone.
Ricciardone recorded a three hit shoutout against the Eagles, allowing them two singles and a double over seven innings of play. Ricciardone spread four walks throughout the game and struck out eight in the victory.
“It’s nice to be behind Laura on the mound when she’s out there and doing her job well,” Gusse said. “She works the corners and works on the mound and we’re lucky to play behind her.”
The Harvard offense awoke in the second inning. The combination of a walk, a perfectly executed sacrifice bunt, and a single by Applebe brought Gusse in to score the first run of the game for the Crimson.
The Harvard offense was not done yet, as senior third baseman Kasey Lange reached first on a fielder’s choice and advanced 60 feet on an Eastern Michigan throwing error. Gusse singled later that inning, sending Lange to third. A passed ball allowed Lange to cross the plate for the Crimson’s final run of the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In warm conditions, the Harvard Alpine ski team competed in the two-day Middlebury Carnival this weekend. The competition was the East Regional qualifier for nationals. The Crimson only qualified Rebecca Nadler, the alpine captain, for the NCAA championship.
Friday held the slalom competition. The men’s team struggled with freshman James Stevenson leading the way placing 52nd with a time of 1:45.13. The other four Harvard skiers all finished, with sophomore Simon Merryweather, sophomore Dan Rittenhouse, freshman Daniel Fowler and sophomore Matthew Mansson finishing 54th, 61st, 64th and 65th respectively.
“Friday, the weather was undesirable,” Rittenhouse said. “It was warm and raining most of the day, by the time most of the team went it was poor conditions with holes in the course.”
On the second day, the conditions were much more favorable, but the Crimson struggled finish the runs down the slope. Three of the five skiers did not finish either their first or second runs. Merryweather finished one spot better in 51st this race with a time of 2:03.71. Stevenson also finished, placing 54th.
The woman’s team qualified one skier for nationals in Nadler. She finished 16th in the slalom competition with a time of 0:52.16. Because of a lightning strike before the second run that disabled the quads, only one run was counted for the slalom, a rarity for skiing competitions. The next highest-placing skier for the Crimson was freshman Kaitlyn Gibson who finished 33rd, with a time of 0:55.29.
On Saturday in the Grand Slalom, Nadler finished in 8th place with a total time of 2:01.40. Nadler’s result qualified her for nationals for the event she won an NCAA championship in in 2012 as a sophomore. Gibson also placed 29th in the event. All four women’s skiers for Harvard finished both runs of each race.
“It was Rebecca’s last race with the entire team, and although the team did not do as well as we had hope, we celebrated her career,” Mansson said. “We brought out a bottle of champagne and sprayed her with it, and the whole team carried her off after it was over.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team (1-1) opened its 2014 campaign with a pair of games on the West Coast.
The Crimson suffered a 14-10 loss to Stanford (2-0) on Saturday, but the team rallied back on Sunday to defeat St. Mary’s (0-2), 18-7, and end the weekend with an even slate.
The Crimson’s offense was paced by a handful of freshmen, which combined for 17 of the team’s 28 total goals on the weekend. Freshman attacker Marisa Romeo led the group with seven goals between the two games.
HARVARD 18, ST. MARY'S 7
With three goals in the first three minutes of the game, the Crimson took no time bouncing back from Saturday’s loss. The team built on this early and commanding lead en route to an 18-7 rout of the Gaels on Sunday afternoon.
“We were really looking for redemption after the loss yesterday,” Romeo said. “A lot of our experience from then made us jump right out and take that aggression out in the opening minutes.”
After the Gaels cut the lead to 3-1, Harvard responded as Romeo and classmate Megan Hennessey both found the back of the net to extend the Crimson lead to four.
This pair of freshman attackers spearheaded the Harvard offense, as Hennessey tallied five goals and two assists in the game, and Romeo added another four goals and two assists.
The Crimson kept command of the game and closed out the first period, 11-4, with its greatest lead of the day to that point.
Harvard maintained the advantage by scoring the first two goals of the second period. After the Crimson and St. Mary’s exchanged two goals apiece, Harvard gained a double-digit lead with a goal by Romeo to make it 16-6. Goals by sophomore defenseman Carolyn Bruckmann and senior attacker Chloe Soukas gave the Crimson a twelve-point advantage, 18-6, with just under seven minutes to play. In the final minutes, Harvard held the Gaels to a single goal to seal the victory.
“We were really staying with our set offense, which is a lot of movement and passing,” Romeo said. “So girls were getting open and we were able to share the scoring.”
The Crimson took 47 shots in the game, more than double the 20 taken by the Gaels. St. Mary’s goalie, Sydney Pinello, kept the Gaels in the game by turning over 18 of those shots.
Turnovers proved costly as St. Mary’s squandered the ball 26 times to give the Crimson the opportunity to extend its early lead.
STANFORD 14, HARVARD 10
Although the Crimson outscored the Cardinals, 8-7, in the second half, it was not enough to overcome an early deficit.
Stanford had Harvard on its heels early with four unanswered goals in the first ten minutes of the game. Sophomore attacker Alexis Nicolia responded with two goals for the Crimson to cut the Cardinals lead in half. Stanford soon regained the advantage and closed out the first period with an 8-3 lead.
Nicolia and Romeo combined for six goals to pace the Crimson offense. Rookie midfielder Maeve McMahon also contributed a goal, collecting two ground balls, and adding a draw control.
Early in the second period, the Cardinals buried the Crimson with four goals in succession to take a commanding 12-4 lead.
“I thought Stanford [was] really physical and they pushed us off the ball,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “I think that we had to adapt to that before we could start putting points on the board.… Then we settled down, and we started to chip away. But you can’t give that kind of lead to a good team and expect to come back.”
Trailing by eight with just 17 minutes left to play, the Crimson captured the momentum by tallying four consecutive goals. Stanford sophomore attacker Meg Lentz retaliated and scored her fourth and final goal with 9:13 left in the game to halt Harvard’s run and increase the Cardinals’ lead to five. Two late Crimson goals were not enough to close the distance, as Stanford held on to close out the win, 14-10.
Coming off an impressive freshman campaign, sophomore goalie Kelly Weis anchored the Crimson’s defense with nine saves. This was not enough to fend off a strong Cardinals’ offense, which outshot the Crimson 31-21 on the afternoon.
“I’m actually not disheartened by this game at all,” Miller said. “I know [my players] were a little disappointed in themselves. But I feel like this is a learning experience, and we’re going to get better from it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its spring season home opener, the Harvard men’s tennis team squared off against top-30 national competition along with local rival Boston University, and the team finished its weekend with a 2-1 mark.
The No. 24 Crimson (6-4) displayed poise in finishing off a 4-3 win against No. 29 Northwestern (10-4) and dominance in a 6-1 margin over the Terriers (4-5), while falling just short against No. 22 Memphis (5-2).
“I think we did pretty well this weekend,” junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “We were hoping to take all three [matches] but came up a little short. But given the competition level, everyone did a great job.”
HARVARD 6, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 1
On Sunday night, Harvard wrapped up its weekend of play with a dominant win over a crosstown foe. The Crimson has traditionally faced the Terriers in an early-season contest, and Harvard’s 6-1 victory marked the third straight season it has bested BU by the score.
In its third match of the weekend and second of the day, the Crimson worked some non-regulars into the lineup but still managed to easily outpace the Terriers.
Despite playing with different pairs, Harvard captured the doubles point with wins on the second and third courts. Co-captain Casey MacMaster, who normally plays at No. 1 doubles with junior Denis Nguyen, teamed with fellow senior Brendan Seaver to capture an 8-4 win.
In singles, normal No. 2 junior Shaun Chaudhuri slid up to the first slot and cruised to a 6-0, 6-1 win. The Crimson captured three other straight-set wins at the second, third, and fifth positions to clinch the victory. Only sophomore Kelvin Lam’s 0-6, 6-4, 1-0 loss at No. 3 prevented a Harvard shutout and gave BU its first point of the season against a ranked squad.
According to Harvard coach Dave Fish, that the Crimson succeeded without playing its starting lineup is a testament to the team’s depth.
“The guys [who aren’t regulars] are great players,” Fish said. “It’s nice for our guys to know that they could play on other varsity teams. We have an embarrassment of riches.”
MEMPHIS 4, HARVARD 3
The Crimson failed to pick up its second win of the weekend against a ranked opponent in Sunday’s early tilt, falling just short in a 4-3 loss.
Harvard’s uncharacteristic struggles in doubles continued on Sunday, as freshman Sebastian Beltrame and junior Christo Schultz picked up the lone victory on the third court, 8-6, as the Tigers captured the doubles point.
MacMaster and Nguyen, ranked 14th nationally, fell just shy in a showdown with No. 8 David O’Hare and Joe Salisbury, as the Crimson’s top pair lost in a tiebreak, 8-7.
“It’s tough to come back from [losing the doubles point] twice in a row,” Steinroeder said. “We know we can still win these doubles points, but things aren’t falling into place yet.”
For Harvard, things got worse before they got better. Nguyen dropped his first match of the season to Memphis’ Connor Glennon, 6-3, 6-4, and an injury to freshman Brian Yeung put the Crimson in a 3-0 hole.
But Harvard would turn it around, picking up wins from freshman Andrew Ball, Steinroeder, and Beltrame at the third position to knot the match at 3-3.
It all came down to Shaun Chaudhuri at No. 2, but the junior fell in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0, to secure a 4-3 victory for the Tigers.
HARVARD 4, NORTHWESTERN 3
On Friday afternoon, the Crimson outlasted the Wildcats in a thriller, beating them for the second consecutive year by a score of 4-3.
In doubles, Nguyen and MacMaster were upset by Northwestern’s Raleigh Smith and Mihir Kumar, while Steinroeder and Lam came up short at No. 3 to hand the Wildcats the 1-0 advantage.
Northwestern’s Sam Shropshire took down Chaudhuri, 6-1, 6-3, to put Harvard in a 2-0 rut, but Ball stopped the bleeding with a 6-4, 6-2 win.
From there, Nguyen notched a straight-set win at No. 1 to tie up the match. Beltrame dropped a three-setter on the third court, but Steinroeder rebounded with a 6-1, 5-7, 6-3 win to knot up the match at three points apiece.
The decisive match would be Yeung’s, who found himself in a third-set tiebreak after losing the first set, 3-6, but capturing the second, 6-1. Yeung eventually prevailed in the tiebreak to earn the 4-3 win for the Crimson.
“Anyone who can win the Ivy League this year will have to rise to the challenge,” Fish said. “All of the other teams can rise to it on any given days. There are no free lunches in this league.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even though he grew up nearly 1,000 miles from Lavietes Pavilion, Siyani Chambers, point guard of the Harvard men’s basketball team, is at home in a Crimson uniform.
The sophomore, who propelled Harvard to a road sweep of Penn and Princeton this past weekend, is an integral part of the Crimson offense, averaging 11 points and 4.9 assists over the 2013-2014 season.
Chambers made his presence felt on Friday and Saturday as Harvard travelled to face the Quakers and Tigers, averaging 11 points and nine assists in each contest. The weekend marked the first time in 25 years that the Crimson has swept the series against its conference foes.
His performance earned him the award of Ivy League Player of the Week for the third time this season.
“[These were] big moments, obviously a big weekend for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We go on the road for four in a row and for those two there at Penn and Princeton. I thought he deserved to be Player of the Week. I don’t know about other players in the conference and what they did, but you can just see his value and what he’s brought to the team.”
Chambers had one of his best games of the year on Friday night, ending the game against the Quakers with 10 assists, nine points, and two steals. He was also 6-for-6 from the free throw line and an impact player working with his teammates.
“He’s dynamic at [the pick-and-roll],” Amaker said. “He’s a magnificent ball handler. I think he’s the best ball handler and the best passer in our league. I just think his presence and his leadership is daring. He seizes moments. If there’s something there, he seizes it. He really has a knack for that.”
Chambers seized the moment once again against Princeton on Saturday night in New Jersey, when the Crimson fell behind by 12 points in the first half.
Understanding the importance of the game for their Ivy League ranking, Chambers and the team approached the contest with particular intensity.
“We all wanted that game very bad,” co-captain Brandyn Curry said. “It’s something we talked about and a lot of the seniors spoke up about at practice…. [Chambers is] a fiery one, and he always has a lot of energy. That’s who he is and that’s why we love playing with him. He definitely brings a lot of emotion to the game and loves winning.”
Chambers fueled the Harvard effort that tied the game and ultimately put the Crimson ahead, with a layup in the second half that tied the game at 30-30.
Later in the half, he recorded another bucket that put Harvard ahead for the first time since the game’s beginning.
The Crimson held the lead for the rest of the contest.
“We talk about him all the time and his spirit, his presence and his quarterbacking, how he handles himself out on the floor in terms of never looking like something’s wrong,” Amaker said. “He has that vibe and that step about him. Our players rally around that…and he did it last year as a freshman and now this year as a sophomore.”
Chambers finished the game against Princeton with 13 points, eight assists, and five rebounds.
In his sophomore campaign with the Crimson, Chambers has made himself responsible for running the team’s offense and being the anchor that his teammates look to on the floor, much like he did his rookie season.
“He’s a tremendous player and very deserving of every award he’s getting,” Curry said. “He does so much for our team. He’s the leader of our team; we go where he goes and with him setting the pace and him being the quarterback and finding everybody.”
The point guard’s numbers are down slightly from his freshman campaign; he is averaging 1.4 fewer points and one fewer assist per game this season.
But the drop may be attributable to the number of offensive threats in the Crimson rotation with the return of Curry and senior forward Kyle Casey. Chambers has taken on the task of integrating different scorers into the offense and maintaining his own stats—all at the same time.
“I’ve mentioned this before, Wesley [Saunders] is probably our best player, but Siyani is our most important player,” Amaker said. “I think he’s proven that from last year to this year…. And then you talk about his playmaking ability. He’s a dynamic playmaker, and I’m thrilled for him and how he played.”

As the polar vortex continues to plague our campus with piles of snow and dreaded slushy corners, I’m finding it harder and harder to get out of bed, much less actually leave the Quad. While all this accumulation might be igniting your inner 9 year old’s Frozen fantasy, I took a snowflake to the eyeball this morning, and it was definitely not magical. Queen Elsa: go home, you’re drunk. The cold definitely bothers me.What I would get out of bed for (sorry OEB 57), and what my life has been lacking recently, is some great live music. As a serious audiophile, I often look back on a semester and wonder how I didn’t make it into Boston to see more shows. As a student with a million commitments, it’s really hard to stay on top of which act will be in town when, and even tougher to get tickets enough ahead of time to avoid getting swindled by scalper site prices. This series is my attempt to keep myself (and you) in the loop about the amazing music that’s happening just a few T stops away, or even on campus! So hopefully next time that hipster in your section starts talking about the killer live jazz they saw last weekend at the Lily Pad, you’ll stop them and say, “I know. I was there”.This Week

Happy Monday! This past week has been full of important events in the news, and here's a quick run-down of what you should know has been happening around the world.
1) Protests and Political Turmoil in Ukraine: Protests have been rocking this European country since last November, with citizens advocating for greater integration with the Europe Union while simultaneously speaking against government corruption, human rights abuses, and President Victor Yanukovych. The protests took a violent turn last week. Since then, over 80 people have been killed, President Yanukovych has been voted out of power, and an interim president has been named. There is sure to be more upheaval in the days to come.


2) Protests and Political Turmoil in Venezuela: That's right—Ukraine isn't the only place facing unrest. Protests have also been taking place against the nation's socialist government, led by Hugo Chavez's chosen successor, Nicolas Maduro. The leader of the opposition has been jailed, but the protests continue on.
3) Protests and Political Turmoil in Sochi: Okay, not really. Although there was minor controversy around the results of the women's figure skating competition, and major tears around the fates of the men's and women's hockey teams, the 2014 Winter Olympics were fairly succesful. Final medal tally: Russia in first with 33, the United States in second with 28, and Norway in third with 26. Freaking Russia.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
The warmth we've been experiencing the past few days will disappear slightly, with temperatures only getting up to a high of about 33 degrees. Thankfully, there's only a 10 percent chance of precipitation, so at least we'll be staying somewhat dry.

Season two of Netflix’s hit series “House of Cards” is about 11 hours long. What did Harvard students give up to binge-watch the entire series last week? Flyby has compiled a list of the things Harvard students gave up and which “House of Cards” character would do the same.
 Health (The Frank Underwood)
“There are two types of pain. The sort that makes you strong and the useless pain.” Inspired by Frank Underwood’s way-too-regular trips to ‘Freddy’s BBQ Joint,’ some students are prepared to ignore the advice of their pre-med peers and give up going to the gym to keep fueling their addiction. After all, Frank Underwood hates that stupid rowing machine his wife got him. For added Underwood-like health direction get addicted to cigarettes. (Do not actually get addicted to cigarettes. That is a horrible idea.)
 Sleep (The Doug Stamper)
They say you can have sleep, a social life, and academics at Harvard, but only two of the three. Last week Harvard students replaced sleep with obsessively following the life of fictional character Frank Underwood. How very Chief-of-Staff Doug Stamper-like, already clearly sleep-deprived, poor Doug is most certainly overworked but like so many Harvard Freshman, keeping up with the Underwoods is more than worth it.
Social life (The Zoe Barnes)
Forget to meet up with friends because you needed to watch that next episode? No worries, young Zoes, there are far more important things than a healthy private life. It’s all about getting through the series before anyone else can.
Midterms (The Peter Russo)
Like so much of the series, “we're in a very gray area. Ethically.” But there will certainly be more midterms, and there is only one season two of House of Cards. Sometimes life should be lived intensely and for the sole purpose of enjoyment. What could possibly go wrong?
Essay grades (The Remy Danton)
How much does lateness kill a grade? 1/3rd of a grade for every 3 hours? While we’d never encourage it, calculating students can cover half of the series for only two-thirds of a grade deduction. It’s all about tradeoffs and priorities.
Daylight (The Linda Vasquez)
Similar to White House Chief of Staff, Linda, a lot of vitamin-D has been sacrificed to Netflix. But it’s winter anyway, right?
Meals (The Frank Underwood pt. 2)
“There are two types of pain. The sort that makes you strong and the useless pain.” Giving up meals to watch HoC may make you physically weak and malnourished, but it will make you mentally stronger and more able to manipulate the world around you. That’s the goal, isn’t it?
Nothing (The Claire Underwood)
For those perfect, Claire Underwood-esq jugglers of life. Elegant, balanced, and ruthless with time management, these people can seemingly do it all. Be careful, though, there may be some hidden fire behind this person’s cool facade.
