After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Caveman put out their first album over two years ago and are signed to the semi-major label Fat Possum Records, they have managed to stay under the radar to the point that one cannot find them on the nearly omniscient Wikipedia. Though their first album, “CoCo Beware,”didn’t generate much buzz for the Brooklyn-based, five-piece rock group, it certainly seems that Caveman’s second, “Caveman,” does more than enough to bring them recognition. Other than the lull that sinks the middle of the album, “Caveman” does an exemplary job of combining distant guitar riffs, smooth synths, bright vocals, and solid beats to create a complete sound with an immersive effect.
 
Caveman don’t waste time. The second track on “Caveman,” “In The City,” is the strongest song on the album. With this track, Caveman fully unleashes their potential to create entrancing music. Other than the guitar solo that floats behind the synths midway through, the structure is relatively simple, creating a mesmeric effect. The synths lay down a quick and catchy melody, and the earnest vocals—which are the driving force of the song—soon follow, “It’s like the ones who only know. / It seems like the ones who always go.” From here, the album becomes less abstract while retaining its brilliant sound. After “In The City,” the third track, “Shut You Down,” changes the dominating instrument from synths to guitar, though the rest of the aesthetic from “In The City” is preserved. The lyrics also change to more obvious statements about love, like “I’d have to shut you down to let you go / That it’s just easier to say, ‘I’m wrong.’” The album continues to evolve its form as it progresses, but to their credit, Caveman stays true to their sound throughout, combining cohesiveness and interest.
 
The downfall of “Caveman,” however, is that the progression of songs eventually leads the album to an atmospheric sand trap. The tracks “Ankles” and “Pricey” are both slow-moving and don’t leave much to hang on to because of the overused synths and fuzz boxes. This comes as a bit of a letdown following the well-rounded sound of the earlier tracks. Luckily, this lapse in enticement is short-lived thanks to “I See You,” the sand wedge of this album. The simple act of using an acoustic guitar to start this track breathes new life into the album. Soon after, ingenuous vocals and a heartbeat-like percussion section join in; the lyrics contribute a sense of yearning. Among the many passionate verses, Caveman sings, “I see you lookin through me, so I won’t fight what I believe.” Though the still-maturing band is unable to avoid stumbling into blandness, the stripped down “I See You” expertly rejuvenates the album when it becomes sluggish. The three remaining tracks after “I See You” harken back to the sound established in the beginning of “Caveman” and form a memorable sequence that gradually brings the album to a close.

“Measure Up,” which played in Adams Pool Theatre until Sunday, comprised two very different plays on the subject of feminine identity. The first play, “Beautiful Bodies,” written by Laura Cunningham and directed by Rachel J. Stephens ’15, took a much more realistic approach to the subject, retelling the story of six women gathered for a baby shower. This performance, which investigated the thoughts and struggles of women through their conversations, was perfectly contrasted by a surreal second play, “The Most Massive Woman Wins,” written by Madeleine George and directed by Lelaina E. Vogel ’15. Both plays worked in tandem to build and destroy the modern conception of a woman.
The second play added a level of complexity that was missed in the first. While directed impressively and acted superbly, the script of “Beautiful Bodies” was at times very predictable. The script, which seems to include various feminine clichés, at times lost its potential impact by refusing to let characters stray from these stereotypes. There is the woman who is wasting away from obsession over an ex (Wanjiku "Anshee" Mungai ’14), the fiery and at times insulting redhead (Olivia M. Munk ’16), the heartbroken, broke actress/waitress who epitomizes an emotional wreck (Carter L. W. Stratton ’16), the carefree woman pregnant from a brief affair (Alexis J. Smith ’15), the snobbish control-freak (Alice Abracen ’15), and the only consistently likeable character, the host of the baby shower (Nancyrose Houston ’15). Their emotions peaked peak, at the climax of the play, in a way that was too predictable—a problem with the script that resulted in a comically melodramatic ending.
Despite these noticeable flaws in the script, the show still conveyed real sentiment due to the talent and believability of the acting and staging. The play deals with everything from age to infidelity to the clitoris, all in quick and snappy dialogue. “After a certain point, there are no men, no sex. You just get rashes,” said Abracen’s Martha, summarizing the fears and insecurities the women confronted throughout the show.
While the first play was enjoyable, albeit predictable, the second play succeeded in portraying the same commonly discussed topics in an abstract and nuanced way. The elaborate set by Nandhini L. Sundaresan ’15 and props by Leila Y. Islam ’15 present in the first play disappeared in the second, which instead featured only four women (Munk, Abracen, Stratton, and Brenna K. McDuffie ’15) dressed in black and four plain chairs. The simple set gave actors the freedom to change the time and place within the show; the rearrangement of chairs quickly shifted the scenes between diverse locations such as a children’s playground and the lobby of a liposuction clinic. These four women, the disjointed points of focus in “The Most Massive Woman Wins,” took what had the potential to be an equally clichéd script and used it to artfully and hauntingly display the crumbling female identity. The entire theater became a stage as the four women left the front of the performance space to surround the audience and immerse the viewers in the experience of these women’s self-destruction as a result of societal projections of the ideal woman.
Though George’s script includes topics such as self-mutilation, bulimia, and rape, it manages to trace the characters’ wide range of issues back to a central point of suffering: the effect that weight has on identity. As characters relive their emotional tragedies from childhood and adulthood, their stories intensify and take on an increasingly serious tone. The tension in the play builds until one woman literally lights herself on fire in an attempt to improve her body. Another woman comes to a sad revelation after years of sexual rejection: “If I can’t change the world, I have to change myself,” declared Sabine (Munk) as she attempted to justify her decision to undergo liposuction.
When juxtaposed with a logical and structured discussion of the issues women face in “Beautiful Bodies,” the second play’s complete destruction of the female psyche—so rationally defined by the first play’s characters in their conversation—took away the option to label and stereotype the challenges women face. Having such young, beautiful girls play the roles of women who worry about their appearances and describe themselves as fat only pulled into question the ways in which all women define and destroy themselves as well as the labels that society places on women. The plays worked together successfully to create an image of the woman only to take it apart, offering uncommon insight into Western female body politics.

To the Editor:
John F.M. Kocsis's article, "Government, Get Out of Marriage," purports to show that marriages are properly a religious function, not a government one, and thus that governments should not recognize them. However, it gets facts wrong and arguments backward.
For example, in his argument that state-recognized marriage adheres to religious forms, Kocsis claims that "All [couples] need [to be legally married] is for their church to sanction them and the government immediately follows." But this is not true. Couples must belong to those categories that the state recognizes, and any church official who performs a legally recognized marriage does so as empowered by the state, not God(s). Every state-recognized wedding performed near Harvard by a religious official will contain the phrase "by the power granted in me by the state of Massachusetts."
Similarly, Kocsis skates briskly past his observation that "social conservatives aren’t quite right in saying that marriage was born as a religious rite" to go on to argue that it "stands as an institutionalized component in most belief systems." But let's return to Kocsis's earlier observation. Not "quite right" is a dramatic understatement; at least with regard to Christendom, such conservatives are dead wrong. Marriage was a secular function of the Roman state; luminaries as late Martin Luther argued that the medieval turn toward treating marriage as a sacrament was a blasphemous invention. We needn't consider ourselves bound by such history, but it is more than a little embarrassing for the conservative faction to be so ignorant of the history they seek to protect.
Kocsis also demonstrates a remarkable indifference to the many couples his proposal would harm. In particular, Kocsis's glib description of marriage as "divine union" "before God," entailing "eternal commitment of souls" would bar atheist and non-religious couples from marriage, as well as those who belong to faiths with rather different views on divinity, God, eternity, and the soul. This exclusion is non-trivial, and it is cruel.
Kocsis's misconceptions seem to me to flow from a central misunderstanding. Marriage is a religious institution, and a governmental institution, but first and foremost is a social institution whereby we recognize loved ones as family. Religions solemnize it, but it would survive without their benediction; governments officiate it, but it would survive without their subsidy. And both church and state have good reasons to continue their involvement, even if each one rather seriously bungles such involvement from time to time. Contra Kocsis, state involvement in marriage is neither sanctimony nor moral regulation (necessarily); instead, it is a sensible recognition of one of the central facts of our social life. What good government, if it must ignore the way in which its citizens live?

"A Vote of Confidence"
To the Editor:
We write to say that we disagree strongly with the Crimson’s April 4 staff editorial, “To Rebuild Trust, Hammonds Must Resign.”
Those of us who work closely with Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds admire her as a colleague in the academy, as a faculty colleague, and as Dean of the College. We have seen her grapple with countless issues on behalf of both students and faculty.
Those of us who are House Masters have been intimately involved in the difficulties of balancing transparency with privacy and confidentiality. We know that as the school year began in September, there was an unprecedented level of anxiety amongst our students and their families as the Ad Board began to adjudicate, as fairly and individually as possible, the cases associated with the cheating scandal. Students were on edge. Resident deans were on overdrive. And eyes across the country were on Harvard.
We were all alarmed at the possibility that the confidentiality of this much-scrutinized process could be compromised when an Ad Board email appeared in the press. Preserving the privacy of students was critical to the process. As the cases unfolded, we believe that foremost in the mind of Dean Hammonds was the confidentiality of the deliberations concerning the students. It is difficult to deal with situations that are without precedent, but the Office of the General Counsel was engaged at each step.
President Drew G. Faust made clear at the April 2 meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that, upon her review, she found no consistent policy across the University on email privacy and that there are two conflicting policies in FAS.  She announced the launch of a University-wide task force on email policy and a legal review of this particular case in which many of the critical junctures involved confidential discussions.  In doing so, she set a positive course for the future.
We disagree with the Crimson’s unsubstantiated allegations about confidential matters currently under investigation. We believe that Dean Hammonds’ apology and explanation was generous, heartfelt, honest, and exemplary. Let it be an instructive lesson for all of us in dealing with complex issues.
We affirm our confidence in the leadership and the integrity of Dean Hammonds. This is a time to come together, show respect, and have thoughtful dialogue about such difficult matters.
The below signatories are all faculty and/or House Masters at Harvard. Asterisks denote House Masters:
Emmanuel Akyeampong, Ali Asani, Dorothy Austin*, Robert Bates, Robin Bernstein, Vincent Brown, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Homi Bhabha, Suzanne Blier, Lawrence Bobo, Glenda Carpio, Luis Fernandez Cifuentes, Jean Comaroff, John Comaroff, Diana Eck*, Caroline Elkins, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Virginie Greene, Jennifer Hochschild, Biodun Jeyifo, Michele Lamont, Christie McDonald*, Ingrid Monson, Marcyliena Morgan, John Mugane, Jacob Olupona, Stephanie Robinson*, Michael Rosengarten*, Tommie Shelby, Kay Shelemay, Jim Sidanius, Doris Sommer, Ronald Sullivan*, and David R.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The preliminary report on the establishment of an honor code at the College presented by the Committee on Academic Integrity at last Tuesday’s faculty meeting comes at the end of a turbulent year for Harvard, and it is all the more relevant in light of its timing. Almost two semesters after the Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” cheating scandal, and with ramifications of that episode still making national headlines, the committee’s proposal comes as a much-needed administrative response to the debate on academic culture and scholarly integrity that has taken place at Harvard in the past few months.
The committee, which is chaired by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, put forward a number of propositions, among which are the establishment of a Student/Faculty Judicial Board that would hear some cases of academic dishonesty and a mandatory declaration of integrity to be put in writing atop every examination. These measures could be effective steps in fostering a climate of stronger mutual trust among students and faculty, and it is a welcome development that the campus is beginning a dialogue regarding the adoption of an honor code. We at The Crimson hope to see progress along this front, with thoughtful participation of both faculty and students to accompany administrative efforts in all steps of the process.
The possible adoption of an honor code at Harvard is not a new idea, nor one that has been neglected in the aftermath of the Government 1310 scandal: As early as September, a few days after the University announced its investigations, the New York Times published an op-ed in which Rebecca M. Harrington ’08, a former Crimson arts editor, reflected on the history of academic integrity and administrative enforcement at Harvard. Harrington voiced her hopes that a code of honor could foster a better value system on campus.
Concerned about the idea that the fear of disciplinary action might have overtaken a sense of moral obligation to academic honesty at Harvard, Harrington asked: “Does the Harvard administration see cheating as a fundamental moral failing, or as an infraction, like underage drinking?” Harrington pointed to the words of the philosopher and Harvard graduate William James, who in a column published in The Crimson in 1888 argued that the establishment of student societies enforcing their own honor codes could do much in the way of promoting greater social responsibility and widespread norms of honesty.
An honor code that is actively shaped by the student body could be an important and significant affirmation of institutional trust, if implemented by the College. Moving away from policing, the administration would be leaving both the moral responsibility for academic integrity and the liability for dishonesty to students and their best judgment. There are great potential gains from the adoption of an honor code, and it is important that an eventual thrust toward its implementation comes after a long and animated debate among students, faculty, and administrators. The report of the Committee on Academic Integrity is a welcome first step toward the inception of such a dialogue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I go to school in Boston.”
Eyes downcast, feet shuffling, we’ve all uttered this evasive response to that most innocent of questions, “Where do you go to college?” to avoid dropping the H-bomb and inciting  judgment from new acquaintances.
To say that Harvard students live in Boston is a lie, some would argue, pointing to that unfathomable chasm between Eliot House and Allston, the mighty Charles. Muddy rivers and municipal limits aside, they are wrong. Geographically, Cambridge is a part of Greater Boston, and culturally, Harvard as an institution is integral to the city. Just ask the eight million visitors who flock to this campus annually to experience one of “Boston’s top attractions.” Like the heavyweight cotton in the “Veritas” t-shirts you can purchase at Logan Airport without ever laying eyes on Memorial Hall’s majestic spires, Harvard is inextricably woven into the fabric of Boston’s identity.
Thus, it is disheartening, in light of last Thursday’s major announcement that Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino will not seek a sixth term, to acknowledge that the end of the Menino era will mean so little to so many of us. Far from considering themselves Bostonians, most Harvard students do not give much thought to the city. However, our apathy toward Boston can easily be remedied.
First, Harvard students can engage in the Boston community by venturing past the ivy. Harvard’s myriad resources equip undergraduates to spend summers in Manhattan, Mombasa, and everywhere in between, but few students acquaint themselves with the vibrant city on the other side of the river. In this respect, Harvard undergraduates should take a cue from the insufferable tourists we photobomb on the daily commute to class: We need to familiarize ourselves with all that the city has to offer.
Even the busiest of Harvard students has time to let loose once in awhile, and it’s a shame that many of us don’t take advantage of Boston as a recreational space. Students are apt to weekend in New York, as evidenced by lamentation over the recent demise of the Fung Wah bus service, but rarely turn to Boston for diversion. Given the midnight closure of the T, Boston nightlife is admittedly lacking. Nevertheless, there are countless other ways to make meaningful memories in Boston. This is the unique city of Red Sox and golden pine cones, of tea party reenactments, cream pies, and the world’s largest milk bottle. It’s the city where Matt Damon and Ben Affleck initiated their bromance, where eccentric Beacon Hill antiquarians invite you to look at, but not touch, their teacups. What’s not to love?
No matter what Harvard students choose to do in Boston, trips to the city should be valued as a legitimate use of time, neither a distraction from résumé-building activities nor a lesser form of recreation than on-campus nightlife. Is the commute really so interminable that it will detract from your precious study hours? In the time it takes to browse three BuzzFeed posts in avoidance of a problem set, you could have transferred to the Green Line at Park Street. Moreover, with a campus culture conducive to student burnout, it’s important to shake up the indefatigable work hard/party hard rhythm. If the number of times you’ve danced the night away to Ke$ha’s “Die Young” exceeds the number of cannoli in the North End, perhaps it’s time to reevaluate your carpe diem strategy.
Further, it is unacceptable for Harvard students to round out their four years with a naive perception of Boston as nothing more than Fenway Park and adorable duckling statues. As residents of the nation’s oldest metropolis, we have a responsibility to be aware of the geography, demography, and historical legacy of our home away from home. Only then can we start engaging in its current events and contributing our own penchant for social innovation to enrich the city. In order to facilitate these processes, the Freshman Dean’s Office might enhance its orientation programming with readings and dialogue on what it means to live in Greater Boston. Harvard might, at least, make The Boston Globe available in dining halls.
Finally, in order to feel at home in Boston, we must integrate ourselves into its social contract. Initiatives including the First Year Urban Program and Phillips Brooks House Association programs help students engage in communities from suburban Cambridge to Chinatown, but as students shift focus to concentrations and career prospects, Boston-based public service activities become a low priority, and some students miss out on the sustained interaction that is crucial to developing a sense of belonging. Two years into volunteering for the nonprofit Health Leads, I am only beginning to appreciate Boston from a variety of perspectives. I am learning that the Harvard bubble is just that—transparent and easily penetrable—but only if I step out of my comfort zone in lasting, meaningful ways.
Many Bostonians may never have a reason to step off the Red Line at Harvard Square, but it is our privilege and our civic duty to reach out to our neighbors so that we may learn from them. Boston is calling. You need only take time to appreciate it, so that the next time you declare, “I go to school in Boston,” you might do so with pride.

I am not, and have never been, a “joiner.” While the instinct to lose oneself in the crowd and take part in mass spectacles is naturally human, it seems to have largely skipped me: Whether it’s a genetic defect or a design feature of my cultural Anglo-Americanism, I feel as though I’m not doing my job if I can be easily reduced to a type.
This spring break, I brushed up against the limits of my category-phobia and confessed, rather happily, to being a J Streeter. After months of correspondence and flirtation with J Street U, the university arm of “the political home for pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans,” I attended a national summit in Washington, D.C. and was instantly sold.
For quite some time, I had been in line with the moderate, common-sense principles of the five-year-old organization—a two-state solution, concern for Israeli security, an end to the occupation of the West Bank, and belief in political pragmatism—but was too shy to commit the nuances of my realist, Israel-aligned voice to any particular organized camp. What I found at J Street was a home for students in the thoughtful, nuanced middle who bravely resist the reduction of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to “the Arab culture of hate” or “the Zionist colonial enterprise.”
As the former co-president of Harvard Students for Israel, an eminently moderate group by most accounts, I often found myself deeply uncomfortable with the categories foisted upon me: “Israel advocate,” “hasbarist-in-training,” “vanguard of the battle for truth on American campuses.” At regional advocacy sessions, which I tried assiduously to avoid, I found myself awash in a sea of red herring arguments—for example that propagandistic streaks in Palestinian textbooks gave Israel the green light to go on occupying. I was disappointed by the uncritical acceptance of my fellow advocates, whose stock language assumed a sixth-grade understanding of Middle East politics. Serving falafel and waving flags is fun, I suppose, but as a realist, I had to ask: What was I accomplishing?
J Street, contrary to the claims of certain right-wing sectors of the American lobbying community, is the only political action group in Washington and on campuses across the continent that speaks for Israel’s interests (which turn out to align remarkably well with Palestinian interests) while also inhabiting the realm of terrestrial reality. Organized in 2008 with an eye toward countering the establishment influence of American Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose nominal endorsement of a two-state solution is subverted by its unconditional support of Israeli government policy, J Street represents Americans who agree with Ehud Olmert, Shimon Peres, and The Gatekeepers that the creation of an independent, prosperous Palestine alongside Israel is the only way to secure the latter’s future as a Jewish and democratic state.
Among the diverse choir of voices I had the pleasure of hearing at J Street U’s summit were Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine, who lambasted Palestinian groups opposed to Israel’s existence as a state, Tamar Zandberg, a leftist member of Israel’s parliament committed to social justice and grassroots peace activism, and Bernard Avishai, a professor and prolific author who envisions Israeli-Palestinian peace as a win-win social and economic gambit. In classic Jewish form, though nearly all attendees had the same moderate aims in mind, every panel and workshop was a veritable contest of ideas on how to broaden dialogue on campuses, engage mutual adversaries in conversation, and construct a mutually beneficial reality on the ground.
But perhaps most impressive to me was the dynamism, both intellectual and organizational, of a group that only half a decade ago existed in mere theory. In stark contrast to the hasbarists-in-training and Boycott Divest Sanction pipe-dreamers I’d previously met at campus events, my J Street U counterparts were undaunted by complexity, aware of the challenges faced by the two-state project, and possessed of exactly the kind of humanistic realism that earns my respect. Owing to its successful organizing and the impressive scale it has attained, J Street has become not just a place—but the premier place—for voices in support of a more sober American approach to helping Israelis and Palestinians craft a peace in the interest of all but the most extremist parties.
In light of this understanding, I am currently working with the backing of Jews, Arabs, politicos, and peaceniks to formally organize J Street U at Harvard. As the descendant of Revisionist Zionists and a staunch believer in my people’s connection to the land of Israel, I come to J Street not out of Jewish weakness, but rather out of studied political realism and contact with the human side of Palestinian statelessness. And on a campus where the majority of Middle East-engaged students are pragmatic, supportive of a two-state solution, and tired of zero-sum bickering about flyers, op-eds, and op-ed responses, I suspect that we can make it happen. All we need is a few more joiners.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I suspect that the issue of Tyga at Yardfest is a difficult one, not because anyone can convincingly deny his misogyny, but because misogyny and its myriad manifestations are so pervasive and normalized that we take them for granted. There are students who read that petition, agreed with its contention, and then did not sign it because Tyga’s music and other similarly misogynistic club bangers are what they dance to on the weekends and get hype to during workouts. And still others, unfamiliar with his music, wondered how he in any way differs from other mainstream artists who espouse a comparably anti-woman view. The issue is further compounded by the perverse way that, historically, racism has disproportionately positioned rap and hip-hop as American patriarchy’s scapegoats; take, for example, the 1990 charge, arrest, and eventual acquittal of 2 Live Crew for the obscenity of their lyrics.
But there are important differences between what we listen to privately, at parties, or even at personally-funded concert outings, and what a university provides an expensive forum for. That Harvard, an institution facing allegations of mishandling sexual assault cases, where just last semester a referendum demanding that it “re-examine its sexual assault policies and practices” passed with 85 percent support, would then offer a mic, a stage, and thousands of dollars to an artist whose lyrics actively encourage such behavior is a painful irony. But it is an unsurprising one.
Disrespect and subordination of women and their bodies is a part of everyday life, and it functions in quite insidious ways. Recently, I observed a young man pledge passionate support for the petition two days after jokingly reassuring another man that four more shots would make their female companion more receptive to his desire to sleep over. The petition is not an end in itself; the goal is not just to collect electronic signatures and then declare “victory in Iraq.” Protesting Tyga is an effort to compel reflection on our choices, actions, oversights, social affiliations, jokes, and so on. Some of its harshest critics have celebrated the petition for propelling a difficult, nuanced and very important discussion to a campus-wide and almost immediately national scale.
Unfortunately, the petition’s language has been unfairly twisted to imply that its writer somehow had racist motives. People have conflated her words with those of some supporters who linked their endorsement to their distaste for all of rap and hip-hop and its allegedly inherent misogyny, betraying their lack of knowledge of the genre and conveniently disregarding the bigger picture. Hip-hop is such an easy target of anti-misogynistic sentiment not just because of how little many of its mainstream songs leave to the imagination, but because it is predominantly inhabited by black artists. In the context of a society as implicitly, and often explicitly, racist as ours, cultural production of certain minorities are subjected to undue and tireless scrutiny—when they are even afforded any attention. And some, projecting their prejudice, are content to blame all the micro and macro violence perpetrated against women on the lyrics of black rappers, completely ignoring or being far less critical of other serious contributors, like the media more generally, social allegiances, or Congress. It becomes easy for some to shroud their racism—implicit and explicit—in anti-misogyny. We can accept that people so compelled have deplorable motives, and though we might support the same cause, we do it for importantly different reasons. I cannot account for the motives of every person who has weighed in on this issue, nor do I care to. What I do know is that Tyga’s lyrics are unequivocally problematic and degrading to women. So rather than combat racism shrouded in anti-misogyny by condoning misogyny in the service of anti-racism, I would rather elaborate on the issue, never losing sight of the legitimacy of the initial charge levied.
Many people are wondering, why now? I think a better question is, why not now? And still better, if not now, then when? Sentiments toward Tyga are not occurring in a vacuum; consequences of rape culture and misogyny are evident not only in the presence of sexual assault on campus and the various initiatives aimed at addressing it, but also in the nation with the high-profile Steubenville and Torrington rape cases. The specter of Tyga’s visit has provided a timely and relevant way to contribute to ongoing local and larger efforts.
That a petition was not attached to last year’s Das Racist appearance does not imply inconsistency; there is no formula for predicting when protest will rise above the dining-hall debate level. And precisely because of how insidious misogyny can be, it would have been even harder to see or make the sell with previous Yardfest artists. Tyga, in being so undeniably problematic, can serve as a strong rallying point. There is an element of strategy in activism that such a conception of consistency misses: Rosa Parks was not the first African American to refuse to give up her seat on the bus, but hers was the case the NAACP chose to raise to national consciousness. I could outline some choice excerpts of Tyga’s material, but his body of work is so consistently sexist that entire songs—and major hits and thus presumably what may feature at Yardfest—can serve as evidence: Faded, Make it Nasty, and Rack City. Such a conception of consistency is also fundamentally flawed because it confuses consistency with visibility—and apparently to uninterested eyes, because it ignores the consistent anti-misogyny work that many students do across various realms of school life.
Contracts may very well have been signed and checks issued, but an opportunity still exists. If Tyga does still grace Yardfest, how glorious would it be if we all go, feast on overcooked burgers and hotdogs, slap our knees to the Cantab Cowboys, and then when Tyga is introduced, exit Tercentenary Theatre in one giant anti-misogyny, anti-rape culture mass, committing through our sacrifice to aspire to better, to challenge ourselves to shed bad habits and problematic viewpoints, and to take more seriously each other’s battles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students, administrators, professors, and alumni from across the Harvard community are speaking up and sharing their personal experiences with mental illness and stress as part of the newly launched “Harvard Speaks Up” online video series.
The project, created by the Student Mental Health Liaisons, hopes to spark conversations on campus about mental health while also encouraging depressed and anxious students to reach out for help. Since launching two weeks ago, “Harvard Speaks Up” has garnered over 30 submissions.
“We want to let people know that they’re not alone,” said Seth H. Cassel ’13, former SMHL co-President. “Mental health issues are magnified due to the stigma, and students sometimes feel that they are the only ones suffering.”
The project was inspired by the popular “It Gets Better” anti-bullying video campaign for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and queer youths. Cassel and former SMHL co-President Meghan J. Smith ’13 said they felt Harvard needed an open and safe platform for members of the Harvard community to learn about mental health resources.
In addition to personal testimonial videos, the Harvard Speaks Up website features links to on-campus mental health resources, videos explaining the peer support and counseling services available to students, and a discussion board where students can submit questions and discuss mental health concerns.
Several of the video testimonials submitted to the website feature notable members of the Harvard community, including psychology professor Steven Pinker, former University Provost Steven E. Hyman, Eliot House Master Gail A. O’Keefe, and Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira.
In one video, Pinker explained that the part of the mind that assesses the future does not work properly when an individual is depressed.
“You objectively think, ‘Not only am I sad now, but I will always be sad. Life will always be horrible. There is no possibility for it to improve,’” Pinker said, referring to his own personal experiences. “One thing that you always have to keep in mind is that the part of the mind that’s making you think that is not working properly, because things will get better, things can get better, particularly if you seek help.”
Other videos touch on topics ranging from academic and professional failure to the stresses an athlete faces after suffering from a sports injury. Smith said SMHL hopes to have videos that encompass a wide range of experiences so that students will find one or two with which they personally connect.
“We want it to be a very real place,” said Cassel. “We don’t want this to be an edited-down message, because in the end, there is hope and it gets better by speaking up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Laure E. “Voop” de Vulpillieres ’02, a non-resident tutor in Kirkland, shared her secrets for success at asking people out on dates with about 80 students gathered in Cabot House Living Room Friday night.
“I think I’ve asked out 53 people, and I’ve gotten rejected plenty of times, but I’ve also had a lot of awesome dates,” said de Vulpillieres during the dating workshop, entitled “Reading the Signs.”
During the discussion she outlined her five-part process for getting a date, which includes figuring out where to meet people and how to show signs of interest in a person. The workshop featured everything from an explanation of a sociological theory regarding personal ties to breakout moments when members of the audience could practice giving casual physical contact during a conversation.
The event attracted so many students that it had to be relocated from its original location, the Cabot House Senior Common Room, to the larger living room space.
Throughout the workshop students participated in a number of activities meant to prepare them for the dating world. For example, students brainstormed ways to approach a stranger by the food table at a party, coming up with suggestions that included complimenting the person and asking him or her questions about the food. To teach students how to show signs of interest and gauge a person’s level of interest, de Vulpillieres asked the audience to hold the gaze of a nearby stranger for 30 seconds.
The workshop was first offered last year in Kirkland after de Vulpillieres noticed that Harvard students did not go on many dates despite the many students in the college-heavy city of Boston.
The program’s popularity led to it moving to the Quad with the help of Cabot’s sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention tutors Bethany A. Kibler and Roman Feiman.
“Dating and relationships are such a struggle for so many students, yet it’s such a vital part of student life and life in general,” Kibler said.
According to de Vulpillieres, the process she has developed stemmed from her own experiences as a lesbian looking for love on Harvard’s campus.
“Straight people can be lazy at Harvard. When you’re queer, you don’t have the same ability to run into lots of single, intelligent people,” she said.
She acknowledged that the act of asking someone on a date can be uncomfortable, but encouraged students to embrace the “inherent awkwardness” of the situation.
“This never gets comfortable,” de Vulpillieres said. “But if you’re obviously uncomfortable, it’s actually really cute. [And] if they say no, they’re going to say it nicely because it’s obviously hard for you.”
Annie K. Rak ’16, who attended the workshop with other members of her entryway, said she though the step-by-step dating process proposed by de Vulpillieres might be practical and useful.
“I liked how there were specific steps,” she said. “It’s helpful for me to have a more concrete strategy.”

A new study conducted by psychology researchers at Harvard suggests that early and frequent testing improves students’ retention of educational material taught through a virtual platform.
With the rapid emergence over the past year of massive open online courses offered through initiatives like Harvard’s virtual learning platform edX, preventing students’ minds from wandering when studying at home remains a challenge for which there is “shockingly little” hard scientific data, said the study’s author Daniel Schacter, a psychology professor at Harvard.
“Students are trying to focus on a computer screen, and like in a classroom, they may be faced with distractions like the television, smart phones, family members, or day-to-day demands,” said Karl Szpunar, a postdoctoral fellow in psychology who worked on the study with Schacter.
In one experiment of the study, published last week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a group of students watched a statistics lecture that had been broken up into four segments of approximately five minutes each. After each segment, students completed several practice math problems. Some of them were immediately tested on the material from the statistics lecture, while others were just offered more math problems.
Students who were tested on the lecture’s material between each segment daydreamed less and retained more information, compared even to those who had the opportunity to study later, said Schacter in a press release.
During a second experiment, the researchers interrupted the lecture to ask students if they were paying attention to the material being presented. At any given time, 40 percent said they were not.
“It’s a pretty sobering thought about how much attention is actually being paid to the course material,” Szpunar said.
The researchers also found that frequent testing reduced student anxiety over tests due to their familiarity with the questions on the final cumulative exam and their increased incentive to focus.
Szpunar said he thinks the findings might be applied to improve student learning experiences in both the brick-and-mortar and virtual classrooms. He suggested they might be applied to Harvard’s edX courses in order to make them more effective.
“From here forward, we are hoping to work with the folks at edX to actually implement some of these strategies in an online course,” he said.
According to Szpunar, researchers hope to test whether their findings will hold up with students in their actual home learning environments.
“We would like to see how they work for people who are learning from home, where there are more distractions,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The government and psychology departments have introduced new initiatives meant to encourage undergraduates to make personal connections with their professors, as large concentrations work to counteract the idea that their size allows for little contact between faculty and students.
The psychology department will host a “faculty speed dating” event this Tuesday, during which students will sit for five-minute chats with several professors, according to Mahzarin R. Banaji, the head tutor for the psychology department.
To better engage concentrators, this semester the government department is introducing “faculty conversations,” a program that asks each faculty member to reach out to a small group of sophomores for one-on-one meetings.
“Often I think what happens is that students, unless they have some kind of problem, feel it’s kind of foolish going to some faculty member office hours,” said Cheryl B. Welch, director of undergraduate studies for the government department. “Faculty in [government] complain that nobody ever comes to their office hours.”
The new initiative is part of a broader review of the undergraduate government program that also looked at its advising system and concentration requirements.
The speed dating event in the psychology department is part of Advising Fortnight, a two-week program beginning April 8 that is meant to encourage freshmen to begin exploring potential concentrations.
Typically Advising Fortnight is made up largely of meet-and-greets, but Banaji said that with faculty speed dating, the department is trying to find a creative way to ensure that students and faculty actually interact.
“We feel like if we just do business as usual, you’ll come in, we’ll tell you who we are and so on,” she said. “But maybe that’s not the best way.”
Banaji said that the fact that few students visit professors is “very demoralizing” for the department.
“We would like nothing more than to have many [students] traipse in to talk,” she said.
Psychology concentrator Claudia V. Haeussler ’14 said she thinks that because students have academic tutors in their Houses, they do not feel the need to invest in connections with professors.
“I go to office hours only for classes I have problems with,” she said.
Government concentrator Fadhal A. Moore ’15 said that even though professors in the government department are usually accessible, students are sometimes hesitant to reach out to faculty. He added that he thinks the new initiative might increase interaction.
“That definitely sounds like a positive change,” said government concentrator Andre J. Gonzalez ’14. “Some students are a little less inclined to talk to faculty, so that will probably help.”
Welch said that although she wishes it were otherwise, she thinks a lack of strong connections between students and professors is inevitable in a large and rich research institution like Harvard.
“The size and nature of Harvard tend to create these barriers,” she said. “The students have to be more entrepreneurial.”

Over 800 female alumni flooded Harvard Business School’s campus on Thursday and Friday to attend the W50 Summit, a celebration of the  50th anniversary of women’s admission to the school’s MBA program.
The program featured speeches from  female leaders, including University President Drew G. Faust, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, and former Time Inc. Chairman and CEO Anne S. Moore. Over the course of the two days attendees attended breakout sessions, movie screenings, and lunches with their fellow alumni.
In her speech Thursday morning, Faust emphasized the importance of allowing women to have the same access to education as men.
“We educate women because it is fair. We educate women also because it is smart. And finally, we educate women because it is transformative,” she said.
Faust brought up past and present women’s rights activists like Margaret Fuller, the first woman allowed to use a Harvard library, and Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot for her work to promote the education of women, as examples of “pioneers” in the fight for female equality.
Sandberg, who spoke Friday afternoon, also championed a message of female empowerment. Echoing the message of the speech she delivered last Thursday in Sanders Theatre, Sandberg encouraged members of the audience to contemplate what they might be able to do if they did not fear failure.
Sandberg said she thinks the progress of women has stagnated over the past ten years. Women must do more to change their station and not wait for the world to progress around them, she said.
“The world changes with every woman who leans in,” she said.
Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, who delivered the opening and closing addresses at the conference, highlighted several developments regarding the continued push for women’s equality at the school.
According to Nohria, none of the buildings on the Business School’s campus have ever been named after a woman—a fact that will change this year with the opening of the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center.
Nohria also announced the creation of a new faculty position entitled the Diane Doerge Wilson Professor of Business Administration, intended to always be filled by “someone committed deeply to the advancement of women in leadership.” Robin J. Ely, a senior associate dean, will be the first person to hold this title.
Finally Nohria said that the Women’s Student Association, a group that “has done more for this cause than any of us could ever imagine,” has endowed an MBA fellowship to ensure that women from diverse backgrounds can have the opportunity to attend the Business School.
Women who attended the W50 summit said they appreciated the variety of events offered during the conference.
“This school has changed a lot in the past few years,” said Kristine Holland de Juniac, who graduated from the Business School in 1980. “I never really thought about how sexist it was back when I was a student here. But it was and it’s encouraging to see that they’re really making an effort to change it.”

Students sampled ethnic cuisine, attended cultural exhibitions, and competed to be named the first ever “Face of Africa” during “Africa Night,” an annual celebration of African culture hosted by the Harvard African Students Association Sunday.
“Africa Night is the one night where Africans and people interested in Africa all come together to celebrate the culture and diversity of the beautiful continent we call home,” said HASA President Rahim A. Mawji ’15.
The evening featured a broad variety of performances, including a fashion show, a spoken word piece by Tsega Tamene ’15, an Ethiopian dance performance, and a drum and dance piece by the Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble.
During the evening ten students competed for the title of Face of Africa, with performances ranging from poetry recitation to demonstrations of sign language.
“It’s actually much harder to be a contestant for the Face of Africa than it would appear because you have to represent such a diverse continent,” said contestant Colette Bishogo ’16. “But it’s also such an honor.”
The three judges of the competition rated each contestant and ultimately declared two winners—Harald Oswin ’15 and Nzuekoh N. Nchinda ’14.
Oswin, who marched onto stage wearing a loincloth, had some fun with the audience. He asked left-handed audience members to stand and hold their arms up in the air and those who were right-handed to stand and hold their hands together for what he called a “cognitive experiment." But after he got everyone standing, he took a picture on his phone to send to his mother to prove he got a standing ovation at Harvard.
Despite the diversity in type of performance, several of them focused on the topic of depictions of Africa in the Western World.
Princess Daisy M. A. Akita ’15 and Kimberly S. Mihayo ’15, two Face of Africa contestants, recited a poem about how the world only sees the side of Africa that involves poverty when there is so much more to the continent.
Chiru M. Murage ’16 said she appreciated that Africa Night brought together many different cultures.
“I think it’s a great event, not only to bring African students together, but also to share African food and culture with everyone,” Murage said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives of the Undergraduate Council voted unanimously Sunday night to express “tremendous concern” over administrators’ searches of resident deans’ email accounts and the broader issue of email privacy at Harvard. The approved legislation, which also calls on administrators to clarify both the Faculty of Arts and Sciences email privacy policy as well as student email privacy rights, comes less than a week after revelations of a previously undisclosed round of secret searches of a resident dean’s email accounts authorized by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
Following reports that administrators had searched the email accounts of 16 resident deans to plug a media leak regarding the Government 1310 case, Hammonds and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith released a statement on March 11 saying that the searches had been confined to subject-line queries of resident deans’ administrative accounts. But at a faculty meeting last Tuesday, Hammonds contradicted her previous statement, citing her “failure to recollect” additional queries of one resident dean’s administrative and faculty accounts—a breach of FAS policy—that also went beyond a simple subject-line search.
Currier representative Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who introduced the UC legislation at Sunday’s meeting, called on his fellow representatives to respond to students’ anxiety about their email privacy.
“This should be something that we’re all concerned about and having talked to many students, I know there are many concerns,” Goffard said during his presentation of the legislation. “At the end of the day, it’s their information that is under threat of being exposed and that’s just not something that as the Undergraduate Council we should be supportive of or not take a stance on.”
UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 emphasized that the precedent of the administrators’ searches threatens not just the privacy of faculty or resident deans, but also that of students.
“With emails, the [faculty and student] policies are very intertwined,” Raghuveer said in her introductory remarks at Sunday’s meeting. “If a student is emailing a resident dean or faculty member, obviously if any of those emails can be searched, it’s a problem that affects all of the involved parties.”
The UC’s legislation also aims to give voice to students in upcoming discussions about email privacy at the University. It requests that UC members be present at at least one meeting of a task force formed by University President Drew G. Faust that will craft recommendations for a comprehensive new email privacy by the end of the fall semester. If that request is accepted, the representatives would use that meeting to convey the opinions of the student body, contribute to the discussion of policy recommendations, and present a UC memo on privacy policy, which is slated for release sometime this week.
Speaking in an interview after the meeting, Kirkland House representative Matthew R. Marotta ’14 called for a wider UC discussion about the recently revealed second email searches and Hammonds’ acknowledgement of her role in the mishandling of the queries.
“I think as a Council, we have a responsibility to have some kind of discussion about what happened, at one of our meetings,” said Marotta, noting that he was expressing his personal opinion, rather than that of the UC. “I think that we have a responsibility to advocate for students.”
However, Marotta emphasized that if the UC does decide to legislate on Hammonds’ actions, it should do so considering all the facts and the existing ties between the UC and Hammonds, so that the UC could continue to communicate student voice to administrators.
“I am 100 percent behind having a discussion about it and making sure that that discussion and whatever is decided upon within the UC forwards our working relationship with Dean Hammonds and with University Hall,” said Marotta.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard softball team split two double-headers against Princeton and Cornell this weekend, demonstrating offensive power despite inconsistency.
 
In both losses—the first games against Princeton and Cornell, respectively—the Crimson struggled to string together hits and left runners on base in do-or-die situations. Against the Tigers, Harvard loaded the bases in the sixth and the seventh but could not bring a runner home.

 
Harvard saw an improvement in the second game, when junior third baseman Kasey Lange came up big with a bases-clearing double in the Crimson’s six-run fourth inning.
 
Despite having eight players hitting close to or above .300, Harvard is still looking to limit runners left in scoring position.
 
“We are doing 80 percent of the work getting runners on base,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “We just need to bring them home.”
 
ON DEFENSE
 
In its wins this weekend, Harvard was able to contain its mistakes on the defensive side, unlike previous games this season, in which leadoff hits or walks would quickly become a rally for the other team.
 
Although the Crimson pitchers gave up 16 walks on the weekend, they were able to overcome the mistakes and get the stops they needed.
 
Sophomore shortstop Emily Gusse was a defensive standout, making a cross-body throw on a slow chopper up the middle to end the top of the seventh and give the Crimson a shot at the comeback in the bottom of the inning.
 
In right field, captain Shelbi Olson also worked to limit her opponents, using her arm to hold runners on and rob the Tigers and the Big Red of RBI opportunities on fly balls.
 
YOUNG IN THE CIRCLE
 
In both matchups, Harvard looked towards its young pitchers. Freshman Jamie Halula started in both wins and pitched five innings before the games were called due to the mercy rule.
Freshman Morgan Groom and sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz split the rest of the work, and the duo combined to allow 19 runs in both games. Groom started both games and pitched the bulk of the work, going six innings on Friday and 5.2 innings on Saturday.
 
Since losing its top two pitchers from last season, Harvard has focused on developing its young throwers, and all three have seen remarkable improvement in their control.
Senior utility player Jessica Ferri had not pitched since freshman year and was slated to pitch this season, but she has only pitched 1.1 innings this season.

Freshman Haley Davis’ first college home run was a walk-off grand slam that put the game away for Harvard softball (11-17, 4-4 Ivy) in the second game of the team’s doubleheader against Cornell (14-16, 4-4 Ivy) on Saturday.
The 11-2 win, decided in the bottom of the fifth by the run-rule, was especially important given that Harvard had narrowly lost the first game, 10-7.
HARVARD 11, CORNELL 2
As Davis walked up to the plate in the bottom of the fifth with the bases loaded, loud cheers and chants followed the freshman from her teammates and crowd behind her. The sound, already loud, grew deafening after Davis crushed a pitch out to centerfield that eventually made its way out of the park.
The hit salvaged a doubleheader that would have otherwise put the Crimson under .500 in Ivy League play.
“It was a really cool experience,” Davis said. “We had a lot of injuries this week and I came in here as a substitute. To help our team win like that and help them [get to .500] is pretty awesome. It’s the first home run of my college career, and it’s pretty cool to have it be a walk-off grand slam.”
The four runs put the Crimson ahead, 11-2, with seven runs coming in the final fifth inning alone, and ended the contest by the eight-run rule.
The key to Harvard’s second win was limiting the Big Red’s offense to two runs after giving up 10 runs off 11 hits in the first contest. In the second contest, Cornell was able to get eight hits but only converted two of those into scores.
“We didn’t pitch well in game one,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “When pitchers have tough games, that’s hard.  I think [freshman pitcher Jamie Halula] got herself in a position after watching the whole first game, knew their hitters, and knew how to command her pitches and did a good job of limiting them to two runs. We just had a hard time in game one shutting their offense down.”
Halula’s peroformance came after freshman Morgan Groom and sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz surrendered 10 runs in the first game. Halula limited the offense to eight hits, striking out three hitters and only giving up one walk.
“I think we were just able to keep the hits to just a few per inning, rather than all of them in one inning,” Halula said. “We were able to cut down on walks too. You could definitely feel that we believed in ourselves more in the second game, and you could feel that there was more energy from the team.”
On offense, a senior hitting corps that was able to tally runs and limit the number of players stranded on base helmed the 11-run effort. Junior Kasey Lange tied Davis’ four RBIs, scored three runs herself, and drew two intentional walks, while senior Stephanie Regan went 4-for-8 with four runs and three RBIs.
CORNELL 10, HARVARD 7
The team came out strong offensively in both contests, but Harvard was unable to limit Big Red runs in the first game and as a result came out with a loss.
“We scored seven runs in the first game, that should be enough to win,” Allard said. “All we need is pitchers who can keep us in and they couldn’t do that in the first game.”
Groom shouldered the loss in the first game and was relieved by Ruiz in the fifth inning.
Groom finished with two strikeouts, five walks, and six earned runs.
Harvard was down, 5-0, at the top of the third before three solid innings of hitting put the Crimson ahead, 7-5, at the end of the fifth. RBIs from five different Harvard hitters, including three from Lange, helped to put the Crimson ahead going into the final two innings.
Harvard was unable to keep its lead, though, as runs from the Big Red’s Laeufur and McGivney tied up the game going into the final inning.
After three runs in the top of the seventh from Cornell, the Crimson had the chance to rebut but was unable to score any runs.
Harvard now sits at .500 in Ivy League play going into the final few weeks of the season.
“I think we minimally wanted to be at .500 after playing the other division,” Allard said. “So it’s going to be tough, the next few weekends are going to be a dogfight, so we have to play our best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After trailing for the vast majority of the first half, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team came out strong in the second period, scoring three straight goals to claim a one-goal lead over Ivy-League rival Brown, 7-6 in Providence, RI.
It was the Crimson’s (2-7, 1-3 Ivy) first lead since the very beginning of the game when the team jumped out to a quick 1-0 advantage. The Bears (8-2, 2-2 Ivy) dominated the field for the rest of the period, scoring five out of the next six goals and going into halftime with a 6-4 lead.
After Harvard’s second-half run put the Crimson up, Brown quickly responded with four straight goals, and nine out of the next 11, bringing the final score to 15-9 and dropping Harvard to sixth place in the Ancient Eight.
“It was a tough game for us,” senior midfielder Danielle Tetreault said. “But so are all of the Ivy League games. Things just weren’t going our way.”
The Crimson came into Saturday’s contest having lost two straight games, but only by a total margin of five goals. The Bears, on the other hand, had won five out of their last six games, losing only to Ivy-leaders Dartmouth by one goal.
But Harvard came ready to play and was led by a combination of freshmen and senior scorers. The first goal of the game was scored by freshman attack Audrey Todd, her 16th of the season. After Brown responded with its three-goal run, Alexis Nicolia, another freshman attack, scored to bring the Bears’ advantage back down to one.
The score remained unchanged for ten more minutes, until Brown senior midfielder Lindsay Minges scored her second and third goals of the half, on her way to a four-goal game. The second of these came with 8:07 remaining in the half, and from there, it looked like the teams would go into the break with the score, 5-2.
But with just 28 seconds remaining, a sudden flurry of goals broke the slow pace that had characterized the game.
To start, Tetreault scored for the Crimson on a free position shot opportunity. Brown answered with a quick goal to extend its lead back to three goals with 00:12 left, but eight seconds later, Nicolia scored her second of the contest, bringing Harvard into the half only down by two.
“Ending the half like that really helped us get some momentum,” Tetreault said. “Lacrosse is really a game of momentum, and going into the half like that really helped us at the start of the second half.”
The Crimson started the second half with that momentum in hand, as Nicolia secured the third hat-trick of her career 1:27 into the period. Junior midfielder Kyleigh Keating then tied the score five minutes later, and within two minutes captain Micaela Cyr put Harvard in front, 7-6, with 22:13 left in the game. Cyr leads the Crimson in both goals and overall points, with 22 and 32, respectively.
From there, Brown reasserted itself, as Minges found the back of the net for the fourth time. Minges’s goal was followed by an onslaught from the Bears’ leading scorer, junior attack Bre Hudgins, who scored three straight times for a hat trick. Hudgins’ 28 goals rank third in the Ivy League.
Brown was awarded six free position shots to Harvard’s three, and capitalized on four of them, while the Crimson only succeeded once. The Bears also scooped up more ground balls, won more draws, and took far more shots than Harvard.
Harvard led Brown in saves, as junior goalkeeper Jenn Hatfield made eight saves in her second game of the season, despite not playing for the first seven minutes. Hatfield replaced senior Mel Cook, who started the game.
The Crimson had a difficult time securing ground balls against the Bears. Before the game, the Harvard squad averaged 15.4 ground balls per game, and had not picked up fewer than 13 in any contest, but in this one it only managed seven.
The Crimson has struggled stopping its opponents this year, especially in its losses. Opposing teams have netted an average of just under 13 goals per game against Harvard, while the Crimson only puts up 10. Harvard has lost every game in which the opposing team has scored at least ten goals, which has occurred in all of its losses thus far.
“We need to continue to work hard going forward,” Tetreault said. “We just have to keep working to improve the things that we have control over and that [will] help us succeed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first tournament of the spring season, the Harvard women’s golf team finished tied for 11th out of 18 teams this weekend at the Rebel Intercollegiate tournament at the Ole Miss Golf Course in Oxford, Miss.
The Crimson finished 50 over par after three rounds, as five Harvard golfers combined for 914 strokes over 270 holes of the par-72 course.
Freshman Courtney Hooton led the Crimson with a 10-over performance to finish in an eight-way tie for 38th place out of 96 individual entries. Junior captain Bonnie Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor, finished a stroke behind to tie for 46th.
“I was very pleased with how we did as a team,” Hu said. “I think that we may have been a little disappointed with some scores here and there, but as a whole, considering we just started up a couple weeks ago, we did very well in this tournament. It’s going in the right direction.”
Harvard turned in a consistent three days of golf, tallying 299 strokes on Friday, 307 on Saturday and 308 on Sunday. Freshman Christine Lin finished a stroke behind Hu to tie for 50th at 12-over. Sophomore Brenna Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports editor, tied for 68th at 17-over. Sophomore Tiffany Lim shot 30-over to tie for 91st.
“I think we worked hard and really rallied,” Hooton said. “It’s a tough course, so to play how we did, I’m really proud of the team.”
No. 49 Coastal Carolina was the only team to finish under par to take the team title. The Chanticleers led after each day of competition, shooting one-under after 863 strokes to hold off No. 24 Baylor (+8, 872 strokes) and No. 20 Tulane (+14, 878 strokes).
Coastal Carolina’s Jessica Alexander topped the individual leaderboard with 208 strokes and an one-under over the three days. The senior edged out Baylor sophomore Hayley Davis by a stroke with  a -1 performance on Sunday.
“It’s really nice being able to come here in warm weather and play against teams that are very competitive,” Hu said. “Obviously, they’ve played more time in better weather than us in practice. But it’s nice seeing how we stack up against them.”
Hooton opened with a two-over performance on Friday before shooting four-over on each of the final two days.
“I was really up and down and definitely having to battle for pars. But I’m happy with how I played overall.”
Hu tied Hooton for the best Crimson round of the weekend, turning in two-over performances on Friday and Saturday, respectively. Hu shot three-over on Friday and six-over on Sunday.
“I played well the first two days and today [I] struggled a little bit,” Hu said. “But overall, I know what I need to work on, and overall I’m pretty pleased with the different parts of my game.”
This year was Harvard’s second straight appearance at the Ole Miss Golf Course’s Rebel Intercollegiate. The Crimson finished 10th out of 15 teams in 2012.
“I really like this course,” Hu said. “I think the course is tough, but it’s also fair. If you’re playing well, and you’re hitting good shots, you’ll get good results. And if you’re kind of struggling a little, you get penalized but it’s not ridiculous.”
After a long winter, Harvard competed in match-play in Phoenix, Ariz. during spring break after a five-month hiatus from competition. As spring slowly returns to New England, the Crimson continues to adjust to playing outside.
“I think that it’s really helpful that during our spring break we did a lot of training. It’s not really a big amount of time [to adjust],” Horton said. “We just have to dive in and get back into it, so I think that starting out with these tournaments right away is really helpful for just getting us back into that competitive mode.”
Harvard will not need to travel far for its next competition. The Crimson will compete at the Brown Invitational next weekend, April 14-15. The tournament will be Harvard’s last before Ivy League Championships at Trump National Golf and Country Club in Bedminster, N.J., April 26-28.
“I’m really excited about the Brown tournament because I think we are doing well and trending in the right direction. People have a better idea of which areas of their game will need work,” Hu said. “I think we will go into Brown better prepared.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s crew teams experienced radically different conditions across the Northeast in their Ivy openers, but both the lightweights and heavyweights managed to find victory in races this weekend.
The heavyweight team stayed at home, braving gusts on the Charles River to take down Cornell in all varsity races while the lightweight team took home its own share of wins on trips to Philadelphia and Princeton to take on Cornell, Penn, and Georgetown.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
In its first race of the season, the Crimson heavyweight team saw its greatest competition coming from the Charles itself.
“[There were] very challenging conditions today. The wind was kind of the enemy of rowing, and when it gusts like it did today, it can make conditions very difficult,” said captain James O’Connor, who rowed in the second seat of the first varsity boat. “There were a lot of waves, and a lot of chop, and that, combined with very cold weather, can make rowing pretty difficult out in the basin where we do all of our 2k racing.”
Despite the conditions, Harvard was still able to dominate on its home course as the 1V boat blasted through the two-kilometer race in 6:16.3, outpacing the Big Red by over 20 seconds.
“We managed to get it together pretty well and when they finally started our race, we pretty much just scorched over the line and jumped up almost a length in our first 10, 20 strokes, and then never really looked back from there,” O’Connor said. “We just kept on moving, which is good. We managed to extend our lead throughout our race. This was our first race of the season, so it’s always a bit of a shock to the system.”
The second varsity eight and third varsity also found victory in their races, besting Cornell by 12 and two seconds, respectively. The freshman eight boat notched Harvard’s only blemish on the day, as the Big Red eked out a three-second victory over the Crimson’s crew, something O’Connor attributes to the rookies’ lack of experience.
“The guys certainly have the fitness and ability and the power to go that distance, but I think [the results] did show who had done this before,” O’Connor said. “It shows on the day-to-day as we were able to rise to the occasion a little bit better than the freshmen. They weren’t quite ready to come together as a crew for this weekend, so they’ve got some improvements to make, but [they’re] a lot of talented individuals.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The lightweight crew team also opened up Ivy competition on Saturday, taking on both Penn and Cornell on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. The Crimson’s top two varsity boats came in first against the Quakers and Big Red, with the 1V edging Cornell’s boat by two seconds and the 2V seeing a slightly larger margin of victory at six seconds.
“Cornell is looking like one of the strongest teams in the league this year, so it was nice to get in our first [Ivy] race against them,” said Andrew Campbell, rowing in the seventh seat of the first varsity boat. “We thought we had a good piece, came off the line very strong—probably one of our strongest starts of the season so far—and we settled into a lead fairly early on and built upon it down the course.”
Harvard’s 3V boat rode a strong tailwind to a 6:17.1 finish, 12 seconds behind the Big Red’s crew. The novice eight boat finished in third behind Cornell and Penn in a tightly-contested race, as all three boats crossed the finish line within a span of three seconds.
The Crimson then went to Princeton’s Lake Carnegie to face off with Georgetown’s crews, where similar rowing conditions yielded quick races.
“It’s always fun racing [Georgetown]—they’re really physical and a strong crew,” said Erich Schultze, rowing in the three seat of the 1V boat. “The conditions were really fast when we raced here [with] a strong tailwind. It’s good to practice rowing in tougher conditions, which is going to be a theme for us moving forward because we have a couple of races in the basin coming up.”
The first varsity boat overcame minor complications to pull out a victory, beating Georgetown by 14 seconds.
“After Saturday’s race [junior] Michael Wales was feeling really sick, so we changed our lineup for Sunday, putting Schultze into the three seat and the crew really blended together within a matter of strokes off the dock,” Campbell said. “It wasn’t a problem at all.”
The second varsity eight pulled out the largest margin of victory on the day, beating Harvard’s 3V team by nearly 20 seconds and the Hoyas’ 2V by 25 seconds. The second novice four and novice eight also defeated the Georgetown novices by 12 seconds apiece.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On an absolutely wild day at O’Donnell Field, it was only fitting that things should come down to multiple wild pitches.
After Princeton scored four times in the top of the ninth inning, the Harvard baseball team rallied back for three runs of its own to beat the Tigers, 20-19, and earn a doubleheader split on Sunday.
“It was a crazy game,” freshman catcher D.J. Link said. “It was definitely a good team win in that we stuck together and we never really gave up.”
HARVARD 20, PRINCETON 19
In a contest that featured three grand slams, 38 hits, and nine errors and finished with a score better fit for a football game, the Crimson (6-21, 3-5) went into the ninth with a 17-15 lead.
But junior Baron Davis was unable to close the door.
The Tigers (7-20, 5-3 Ivy) began the frame with two doubles and two singles to plate two runs. Davis then hit Ryan Arendt with a pitch to load the bases, and two consecutive fielder’s choices allowed the Tigers to take the lead before co-captain Jordan Haviland replaced Davis and struck out Danny Hoy to end the inning.
But in a game in which it trailed 9-3, the Crimson had one more rally left in it.
Link led off with a walk. He then advanced to second on an infield single by Jeff Hajdin before getting picked off for the first out of the inning.
That’s when the wheels started to come off for the Tigers.
Princeton’s Nick Donatiello walked freshman third baseman Mitch Klug, and sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel hit a single through the right side to load the bases.
Hajdin scored on a wild pitch, freshman Sean O’Neill was intentionally walked to load the bases, and another wild pitch plated Klug before Princeton again elected to fill the bases by walking sophomore Tanner Anderson.
The Tigers then made a pitching change, replacing Donatiello with A.J. Goetz. But with junior Carlton Bailey at the plate, the reliever threw Princeton’s third wild pitch of the inning and Kregel came home to give the Crimson a walk-off win.
“It was great,” Link said. “They made a few mistakes and we were able to capitalize on them.”
After the Crimson scored the game’s first two runs, Princeton put together a seven-run second inning, highlighted by an Arendt grand slam. But the Crimson answered back with consecutive innings of four, six, and four runs.
“We were able to just put the ball in play,” Link said. “Situational hitting goes a long way—that’s how you have big innings.”
Harvard led off the bottom of the fourth with five consecutive singles to plate four, capped by an O’Neill two-RBI hit. The rookie drove in two more in the bottom of the fifth with another single, while a basesloaded walk gave the Crimson its sixth run of the frame.
Princeton scored three times during those two innings as well, and the Crimson went into the sixth ahead 12-10. In the bottom of the inning, Klug singled, Kregel reached on an error, and O’Neill was hit by a pitch before Anderson hit a grand slam to put the Crimson ahead, 16-10.
“The biggest factor about the second game was that the wind was blowing out,” Kregel said. “Anything in the air was going to go a long way.”
But the Tigers answered right back in the top of the seventh. Crimson junior pitcher Peter Kaplan loaded the bases on two walks and a hit by pitch, and Hoy singled to center, scoring one. Princeton’s Mike Ford then hit a grand slam to right center to bring the Tigers within one at 16-15.
The Tigers scored four times in the ninth to take the lead back before Harvard rallied to win.
The Crimson scored 20 runs for the first time in a contest since 2006 and finished with 23 hits, led by Link, who went 4-for-5. Hajdin, Klug, Kregel, and Anderson all had three hits for Harvard.
“A big thing that we’ve been talking about recently is believing in ourselves,” Kregel said. “[That] really helped us gain confidence to fight back and not just back down.”
PRINCETON 13, HARVARD 1
The Tigers dominated the Crimson in the first game of the doubleheader, putting together a pair of five-run innings against Anderson, who fell to 0-4 on the year.
With two outs in the top of the second, Tyler Servais doubled to center, Johnny Mishu singled up the middle, Alec Keller doubled to right, and Hoy doubled to plate two before Anderson finally got out of the inning.
“We just didn’t come out with as much energy as we should have,” Kregel said.
Anderson ran into trouble again in the fifth. Hoy led off with a homer to left center, and the big blow again came with two outs, when Servais hit a grand slam to make it 10-0.
In the sixth, a Ford solo homer to center off freshman reliever Shaun Rubin plated another run for the Tigers, who added two more in the subsequent frame.
Harvard’s lone run came in the bottom of the third, when Link scored on an error.
Ford was dominant throughout the afternoon for the Tigers, allowing just four hits and striking out seven over seven innings to improve to 3-0 on the year.
“The bats weren’t there,” Link said. “[Ford] threw a great game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team expanded its comfort zone over the weekend, traveling to Arizona to compete in the Arizona State Thunderbird Invitational.
“We got to play a lot of courses like this over spring break but generally the courses we play in the Northeast are not like this at all,” freshman Rohan Ramnath said. “The course was really hot and there was a lot of desert everywhere.”
Conditions were a key factor for the Crimson squad, which finished in 15th place out of a field of 18, one place behind the University of Denver and ahead of the University of Hawaii.
Junior captain Theodore Lederhausen and Ramnath turned in top finishes for the team, tied for 58th place with scores of 222. Their score comes nine strokes above par and 20 above overall leader Nick Chianello of Oregon State, who finished the course with a score of 202.
“The greens were really fast, which we’re not used to,” Ramnath said. “It was a little bit of a different terrain than we were used to. The ball flies a little bit further because the air is thinner and Phoenix is elevated.”
The invitational was the first competition for Harvard since the team finished the fall season in October.
“I definitely look at this as a stepping stone process that’s moved us along in a positive direction,” head coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We finished 15th out of 18 and obviously that doesn’t sound great, but with the strength of the field and the other teams that were here, that’s actually not a bad result.”
The competition was won by UNLV, which led the field with a score of 843, nine strokes under par, and was closely trailed by the University of California, which was eight under par, and the University of San Diego, which was five under par. Harvard’s team score of 898 put the team 46 strokes above par.
Lederhausen recorded the single strongest round by any Crimson golfer, hitting even par in his first round of play. The junior was as low as three under par with five holes to play, but was hurt by three bogeys down the stretch. Lederhausen followed up with +4 and +5 rounds over the next two days.
“I think the combination of evolving ball striking, good putting and then staying mentally strong was kind of the reason for his big status,” Rhoads said.
Ramnath and junior Kevin McCarthy netted the next two strongest rounds for Harvard. The rookie shot one over par in the first round while McCarthy did the same in the second round. Ramnath followed up his crisp first day by hitting two over par the second day and six over par on the third.
In the third round, Ramnath was set back by two double bogeys and a quadruple bogey on the 17th hole.
“My chipping was really good [in the first round] and in the second two rounds it was as great as it could have been,” Ramnath said. “Yesterday and today I had a couple of big numbers that were basically the different between the first round and the others. The first round was a bit more stable so it was a little bit better that way.”
McCarthy was the third place golfer for Harvard, while sophomore Akash Mirchandani and junior Michael Lai rounded out the team in fourth and fifth, respectively.
McCarthy fell behind in the first round, only able to hit half the holes at or under par, with a score of seven strokes above par. Mirchandani recorded a final score of 19 strokes above par over the three rounds. Lai finished seven strokes above him after a particularly tricky attempt at the 18th hole in the second round caused a score of 13 above par.
Crimson golfers competed against a testing field of schools from the West and Southwest.
Harvard and St. John’s were the only teams from east of Iowa to play in the tournament.
“It was a little bit tougher for us relative to them because they’re playing year round and for us it’s pretty cold in Cambridge,” Ramnath said. “I think we did pretty well relative to how much time we had to prepare.... I know that a lot of these guys are going to see their names on the PGA tour in a couple of years.”

It's getting to be spring, and that means picnics—the perfect excuse for Vitamin-D starved Harvard students to bask in the sun, until we start shivering and have to put our winter coats back on.
Sure, we can all sit on a towel in the Yard and nom while tourists photograph us.  But why not grab some cheap wine and sandwiches from Darwin's or Cardullo's (or, let's face it, Adams d-hall) and explore some of Harvard's secret-yet-superb grassy patches?
1. BARKER CENTER LAWN
Wooden benches, green grass, small trees, and what seems like perpetual sunshine. Pretend you are famous as people walking by on the street (and in the Barker Center Café and basement) spy on you through the gate and windows.
How to Get There: Corner of Quincy and Harvard Streets.
2. FRESH POND
This isn't technically Harvard property, but it's closer than the Medical School, so it counts. Wander the meadows, woods, and parks for the perfect spot to eat.  And if you feel bloated, go for a run around the pond!
How to Get There: Walk toward the Quad, then take a left on Concord.
3. DIVINITY SCHOOOL (ANDOVER LAWN/CONTEMPLATIVE GARDENS)
For the quiet picnicker interested pondering the world on a bench beneath trees.  Really this is on the list because who doesn't want to have a picnic on a labyrinth? (Not that kind.)
How to Get There: Just past Vanserg and the Bio Labs, adjacent to the greenhouse.
4. RADCLIFFE YARD
There are lots of little courtyards and benches tucked away alongside the Radcliffe Institute houses, so keep your eye out. Also the buildings are prettier than Harvard Yard. Women just do it better.
How to Get There: On the way to the Quad, on the left side of Garden Street.
5. CHARLES RIVER
An oldie but a goodie. Sit on benches or the grass, watching adorable elderly couples ambling down the path and your toned classmates rowing down the River.
How to Get There: Walk away from the Quad as far as you can until you hit water.
