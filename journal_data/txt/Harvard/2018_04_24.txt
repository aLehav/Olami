After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s clear from the early pages of Mary H.K. Choi’s debut young adult novel, “Emergency Contact,” that Penny and Sam are perfect for each other. Penny, a freshman at UT Austin, navigates a turbulent relationship with her teenage-wannabe mother, Celeste (“the mom equivalent of a feather boa”), while Sam, a heavily tattooed 21-year-old holed up in the attic of the on-campus cafe where he works, grapples with the sudden news of his ex-girlfriend’s unexpected pregnancy. They’re obviously compatible: Both are young, both are passionate about their art (Penny is an aspiring writer, while Sam daydreams about becoming a documentarian), and both struggle to connect with people in their lives.
The twist? They rarely see each other in real life, despite being digitally inseparable and intensely codependent. Although they originally meet in person (Sam suffers a public panic attack, and Penny, coincidentally nearby, comes to his rescue), the scaffolding of Penny and Sam’s entire relationship is built and maintained via text—a romance whose unconventional narrative is starkly apparent to its main characters. “Is it crazy that we don’t hang out?” Sam texts Penny, halfway through the book. “Hang out? Like for real?” Penny replies, after some thought. “And ruin this?”
But while “Emergency Contact” purports to be a novel about romance, it’s primarily a novel about technology—more specifically, the way its integration into modern life engenders a new brand of intimacy, one whose progression is more rapid and its emotional gratification far more immediate than ever before. Choi, whose reporting for Wired includes an in-depth look on the way teens use social media, has a finger to the pulse of millennial psychology: When the book’s prose does not explicitly report Penny and Sam’s text-lingo-laden conversations, it’s propelled by a particular adolescent energy, one fraught with the anxieties of self-discovery and romantic tension. Who texts first? How frequently? What’s too personal to be revealed, and when does it become acceptable to reveal it?
Though its prose is occasionally stilted, “Emergency Contact” hums periodically with life. Like text message notifications, the book’s spasmodic vibrations have the complexity of emoji-laden missives. What’s left is a freshly postmodern conceit, conveyed in a sweet, albeit simple, parable about the virtues of virtual love and the politics of desire in an evolving technological landscape.
The young adult genre tends to hem in Choi’s prose; the novel’s conversational syntax is accessible, almost to a fault. At risk of going over her (likely teenage) readers’ heads, Choi explains pop culture references. It’s not enough to say “rumspringa” and expect comprehension. Instead Choi resorts to “rumspringa, that rite of passage for Amish people.” Imelda Marcos becomes “Imelda Marcos, the kleptocrat wife of the former president of the Philippines who had hoarded three thousand pairs of shoes while her people starved.” Verbosity blunts impact. At times, the degree of separation between Choi’s adult voice and Penny’s adolescent interior one becomes palpable, and the inhabitation of the teenage voice a more apparent (and inauthentic) construct, particularly in its hyperbole. “Penny would rather eat a pound of hair than reveal her true emotions,” Choi writes in the book’s opening pages; later, Sam “briefly [considers] rolling into a ball and ugly-crying for the rest of the day,” and still later, Penny “could practically hear the AWWWWWWW in her head and Care Bear stares flying out of her eyes.” Free indirect narration operates inelegantly: Penny and her friend, Mallory are “two giggly girls with great big hair doing irrepressibly fun things,” a descriptor that reads unfurnished, like screenplay direction.
But for what it lacks in style, “Emergency Contact” makes up for in substance. Its narrative is most potent when it’s unclean, especially when Choi pays masterful attention to the messy parts of Penny and Sam’s lives. Penny’s evident social anxiety and smarter-than-thou cynicism and Sam’s all-too-real reckoning with depression and poverty lend each respective character a certain roundness. Supporting characters, though perhaps initially stock figures, grow into their roles: Celeste’s frustrating immaturity evolves from a plot device into a complex character flaw, while Penny’s rich-bitch roommates wield their privilege and status in unexpectedly benevolent (and surprisingly, un-patronizing) ways. Choi also gestures at socially valuable conversations: There’s one about race, one about class, and one that comes late in the novel about affirmative consent.
Perhaps her most valuable conversation, though, is not about technology or love or race at all. It’s the one about what it means to be an artist in the world, and this is the most urgent undercurrent of the novel. Sure, Penny and Sam have chemistry with each other, but their real chemistry—not to mention, the foundation of their interpersonal connection—is with their art. Or as Bastian, the 13-year-old subject of Sam’s documentary unwittingly conveys the book in microcosm, “It’s fucking art, man. You don’t choose it. It chooses you. If you waste that chance, your talent dies. That’s when you start dying along with it.” If that’s not love, what is?

5. “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership” by James Comey
If you haven’t heard about “A Higher Loyalty,” you probably don’t live in the United States (or have been absorbed in work these last weeks of the semester). The book, written by former FBI director James Comey, was published last week and has become an overnight sensation. This is probably not owed to its literary value, but to the rare glimpse it provides into major political events that have shaped the current political arena, namely the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the relationship between President Trump’s campaign and potential Russian collusion. Comey’s book is a great companion to “Fire and Fury,” The New York Times bestseller that shed light on the Trump administration’s underbelly earlier this year.
4. "A Horse Walks into a Bar" by David Grossman
When the judges decided to award David Grossman the 2017 Man Booker International Prize for his novel “A Horse Walks into a Bar,” they praised his “willingness to take emotional as well as stylistic risks.” And indeed, over the past few decades Grossman, one of the most prominent figures of contemporary Israeli literature, has taken his readers on bold journeys of humor, pain, and compassion. His most recent novel tells the story of Dov (a.k.a "Dovaleh") Greenstein, a 57-year-old comedian, and his childhood friend, the retired judge Avishai Lazar. The novel takes place over the course of just two hours, depicting one of Dovaleh’s stand-up comedy shows in which his past and present irrevocably collide.
3. "Feel Free" by Zadie Smith
“I have a very messy and chaotic mind,” Zadie Smith admitted in a recent interview with The Guardian. Apparently, writing fiction wasn’t enough to help the renowned British author organize her thoughts, so she decided to turn to essays, which are, according to her, more controllable. The result is “Feel Free,” her second nonfiction collection, which was published in February. The book includes insightful meditations on a wide variety of topics—from Jay-Z to Brexit to Smith’s own childhood bathroom. Smith’s casual, nonchalant style makes for a nonfiction work of contemporary critical thought that is the perfect summer read.
2. "Less" by Andrew Sean Greer
When the publisher of the novel “Less” released short summaries of its plot, readers might have been slightly confused. Is it “a scintillating satire of the American abroad?” “A rumination on time and the human heart?” Maybe “a bittersweet romance of chances lost?” Or all of the above? One way or another, “Less” seems like one of the most fascinating, refreshing reads for the coming summer. It is centered around the life of Arthur Less, a gay novelist who decides to embark on a worldwide journey in order to celebrate his 50th birthday and avoid his ex-boyfriend’s wedding. The novel’s author, Andrew Sean Greer, won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for fiction writing. If it was good enough for the Pulitzer jury, it’s probably good enough for your bookshelf.
1. "Ulysses" by James Joyce
Last month, literature buffs from all over the world celebrated an important event—the 100th anniversary of the publication of the first episode of “Ulysses” in the American literary magazine, The Little Review. James Joyce’s monumental novel needs no introduction: Published in its entirety in 1922, it is considered to be one of the most seminal works of modernist literature. It depicts a day in the life of Leopold Bloom, an advertising agent, in 1904 Dublin, Ireland. Doesn’t sound too exciting? Well, it sure is. Essentially, it is an innovative literary experiment, encompassing a myriad of genres and techniques from dramatic writing to catechism. It even contains one of the longest sentences in English literature. This summer is a great time to enrich yourself in one of the most famous novels of all time.

It’s hard for an artist to be let down if he assumes no one knows him at his own concert. At least it was for Lostboycrow at his recent show at the Brighton Music Hall in Allston on Tuesday night, March 27. At this stop on the Northeastern leg of his Spin the Globe tour, the electro-pop singer opened his set by letting his audience know it was okay if we didn’t know who he was. These self-effacing comments were frequent throughout the show, and they provided insight into some of Lostboycrow’s musical anxieties, as made evident by his performance. Although he is talented and sings with an angelic falsetto, Lostboycrow’s concert was speckled with uncertainty regarding genre and his personal direction. He tended towards a more traditional dance vibe for fear of not engaging the audience. However, when he managed to rid himself of over-amplified electronic influences and stripped down to his bare voice, Lostboycrow connected with the audience and created powerful moments. His music resounded throughout the hall in an all-consuming way.
Upon entering, it was clear Lostboycrow would have to do a spectacular job to compensate for the venue’s deficiencies. The doors opened directly into the main standing area, but the space was too large for the show. The stage only occupied a corner of the room, requiring intimate contact with the artist to avoid distraction from televisions and other adjacent spaces. Through a hazy smoke, Lostboycrow entered the stage with an assortment of spotlights and vertical lights illuminating his all-white costume. From the show’s inception, there was a tension between him and the audience, as many of his actions felt rehearsed: He would, at times throw his hands frenetically in the air at non-crucial parts of songs, and he moved with an exaggerated energy that wasn’t reciprocated by the audience.
It quickly became clear that Lostboycrow was not comfortable in an electronic dance context. His voice is soothingly gentle. Its force isn’t derived from amplitude, but from its sharpness, the ability to remain clear at stratospheric pitches. It isn’t amenable to the high tempo, abrasive sounds of electronic dance. His voice was coerced as it tried to keep up with a genre it wasn’t meant for. His lack of comfort with the genre manifested in his interactions with the audience as well. For the first half of the show, Lostboycrow was performing in an enclosed space. He sang over the heads of the audience, rarely directing his gaze towards the crowd. At times it felt like he may have forgotten the crowd was even there. There’s something bizarre about a concert that fails to break the fourth wall. It’s also strange to see an artist so surprised by his own success. Despite some of the awkward moments, the audience always reconfirmed their commitment with ecstatic applause at the conclusion of songs. Instead of utilizing this as a confirmation of his appeal, Lostboycrow would retort with shy “thank you”’s, interrupting the flow of the concert and surprising even himself with his own positive reception.
Towards the middle of the show Lostboycrow metamorphosed. He began to disregard the superfluous sound that imbued the beginning of the performance and opted for a more minimalist set. When he got behind the synth, he finally began to look comfortable. The way he interacted with the audience changed entirely. The fourth wall was torn down, and for the first time everyone was occupying the same space. Lostboycrow found a rhythm and rode the momentum for a stretch of the conert. During this portion of the concert he combined his expert vocal control with his delicate tone to display a take on dream pop that felt entirely original. It culminated in his performance of “All My Lives At Once.” The song built with Lostboy’s use of miasma to create a feeling of concessionary optimism. By the time he reached the hook, his voice was so thin that it floated above the audience, slowly enshrouding each individual. At this point his voice began to instill a stupor, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between the real world and the world he vocally constructed. The song began to sound finished and suddenly there was silence. Lostboycrow crouched to the ground. One, two seconds passed. Suddenly, in synchrony with the disco ball and spotlights, he burst upwards and belted “Loooove, L-uh-uh-oooove L-uh-ooove.” Time in the venue started to move slowly. Everyone appeared frozen in place as his voice slowly diffused through the space, interacting with every audience member in a personal manner. Re-experiencing this singular moment would be reason enough to attend another Lostboycrow concert.
Although this concert was an enjoyable experience, it had too many conflicting elements to make it feel like a unified whole. All too often it felt like the responsibility of the audience to take control of the concert and will it in a satisfactory direction. Despite these drawbacks, several moments in the concert were stellar, making up for his slow start. When Lostboycrow became comfortable, his soul and voice hypnotized the audience.  If he can scrap his vision of electronic dance and forge a path into a softer, dream pop arena, his artistry will become more valuable and his concerts will become increasingly complete.

At 29, Emma Cline had already secured a three-book deal (rumored to be worth $2 million) and been named one of Granta’s Best Young American Novelists. Among literary circles, she is regarded as something of a prodigy, “fast-tracked by the Muses,” as James Wood wrote in his New Yorker review of “The Girls.” Cline’s debut novel retells the infamous story of the Manson family from the perspective of Evie, a 14-year-old girl on the periphery of the group.
But Cline’s slew of momentous achievements was tarnished last year by the accusations levelled against her by Chaz Reetz-Laiolo, a former boyfriend who accused her of installing spyware on his computer and plagiarizing material from his unpublished writings. “What should have been a happy milestone—publishing my first novel—has turned into a yearslong nightmare perpetrated by someone I believed I had finally escaped from,” Cline said in a statement to The New York Times. On April 11, a federal judge ruled that “The Girls” does not violate copyright law.
Reetz-Laiolo’s allegations were not only ludicrous—anyone who has read “The Girls” can attest to its intensely intimate knowledge of the female experience—but also cruelly personal, extending beyond Cline’s prose and moving further to attack her ad hominem. In a 15-page complaint, 13 of which included sexually explicit texts and pictures, Reetz-Laiolo threatened to blackmail Cline into silence and submission. “[E]vidence shows that Cline was not the innocent and inexperienced naïf she portrayed herself to be,” David Boies, the lawyer representing Reetz-Laiolo (and previously, Harvey Weinstein), wrote.
It’s sad (not to mention darkly ironic) that Cline’s sexual history is being levelled against her given the themes of her novel. In “The Girls,” Cline adeptly identifies the way young women shape their notions of desire and sexuality, and how they internalize the male gaze in self-conscious and harmful ways. “So much of desire, at that age, was a willful act,” Evie narrates. “Trying so hard to slur the rough, disappointing edges of boys into the shape of someone we could love.”
Though painful to admit, it’s unsurprising that a successful female writer is being punished for writing about sex. That’s an old conversation and existing convention in Western canonical literature, both for its female writers and its female characters. Western literature makes clear what kinds of female desire are acceptable, and which aren’t: Hamlet tries to rein in his mother’s sexual desires, obsessively instructing her to “go not to my uncle’s bed.” Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina and Theodor Fontane’s Effi Briest both die for their infidelity. Poor Desdemona, “honest, chaste, and true,” does not even commit adultery, yet she too must perish for the sexual appetite that her husband Othello assumes she possesses. Seminal works of canonical literature, often those penned by male authors, have tended to punish female characters who wield their own sexuality. Just as Cline points out in “The Girls,” the way girls are taught to think about their sexuality is toxic on many levels. They are taught to crave it, then fear it, to simultaneously and contradictorily embody sexual allure and chastity. The moral is clear, both in fiction and reality: When women stray from the narrow definition of acceptability laid out for them, they face severe consequences.
Cline herself is intensely aware of her own vulnerability, the way she slots into these narratives of so-called “misbehaved” women. In a personal essay for The Cut, “The Price of Smiling for the Photos,” Cline discusses the abuse she suffered at the hands of an ex-boyfriend (widely believed to be Reetz-Laiolo). “I was told I wouldn’t be believed because in the same chat where I confessed my fear, anxiety, and confusion about my boyfriend’s violence, I also made sex jokes,” Cline writes. “I was told I wouldn’t be believed because I’ve looked at pornography, written a sex story, dated older men.”
Though it is not new, this centuries-old conversation about the censorship of female desire is imbued with a new immediacy in the wake of the #MeToo movement which originated with the Weinstein allegations and ricocheted into national consciousness—into the corporate sphere, into blue-collar work environments, and yes, into the publishing industry. The women who came forward with their own stories of victimization and abuse were questioned for not coming forward sooner and for staying with their abusers in consensual relationships. Their testimonies were prodded, examined for logical deficiencies under the microscope of public skepticism, and held to the standard of a perfect victim story (itself a problematic notion). It may seem that sexual assault and the censorship of female desire are disparate problems, but they are not: Sexual power has always been considered the domain of men, and when women decide to claim that agency, the backlash is immediate and the result is often violent.
It may seem inconsequential, but fiction largely sets the script for how we navigate sex and understand consent. “Cat Person,” Kristen Roupenian’s viral New Yorker short story, gained traction among female readers for identifying the all-too-familiar ways in which women are socialized to accommodate the desires of their male counterparts. Fictional representation matters and it matters who controls it. Our experiences don’t just inform the art we consume. We model our lives on the stories we hear, and when women are the ones writing those stories, the result is fairer, more complex, and more equitable politics—inside and outside the bedroom.

In 1985, before Suzanne Collins’ “The Hunger Games” trilogy and other dystopian novels flooded people’s shelves, “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood was a novelty that stood out for its powerful message: No matter how bleak her world looks, it is closer to reality than one would hope. However powerful it was in 1985, it is infinitely more so in President Trump’s America. While women have been fighting for years for their reproductive rights, 2017 in particular has threatened to halt further progress. Atwood’s dystopian world, a backslide from the modern world into a society that strips women of power, treats them exclusively as a means for reproduction, and attempts to eradicate nonheterosexuality, touches on so many hot button topics. The TV series is a stark reminder that Atwood’s imagined dystopia is not so unimaginable in our current reality, and now, it’s coming back for a second season.
Both the novel and the TV series present a world in which fertile women act as handmaids, whose job it is to procreate. They live in the houses of prominent couples and take part in a Ceremony, where the wife is present as the husband and the handmaid—who is forced into this nonconsensual act—attempt to conceive a child. Everything is rooted in Christianity, and those in power justify every terrible act—beating dissenters, hanging doctors who perform abortions—by cherry-picking passages from the Scripture. Showing desire is illegal, and even husbands and wives are forbidden from recreational sex. Handmaids must walk in pairs in public, partly to protect each other from the advances of men and partly to make sure everyone obeys the rules. The restrictions of women and sexual desire stifle society.
Although the overarching themes remain the same, the television series accomplishes something the novel cannot. With so many more hours for storytelling, the show rounds out minor characters’ backstories, filing in the blanks and making the story more real. Janine, who is reduced to being called Ofwarren to show that she is her commander’s literal property, is a minor character in the novel. She portrays the way some women break under the stress of transitioning into the new society, but she plays a larger role in the television series. Janine in the show exhibits a hardship not explicitly shown in the novel: The heartbreaking separation of a mother and her child. After forcing Handmaids to bear the children of men they not only don’t love, but who have also raped them, the Commanders and their wives rip the children away from their mothers against the Handmaids’ will.
The Commander and his wife also gain a richer backstory in the television series. The series shows the Commander and his wife before the creation of the new society. They take part in activities we recognize in our own daily lives, from going to the movies to consoling one another after a hard day at work. These moments remind viewers that even people who appear normal, who seem to live average lives, can be hiding radical and dangerous beliefs. Since 2016, those with unpopular and harmful ideals feel safe enough to step out of the shadows under the Trump administration. “The Handmaid’s Tale” is a warning of just how many people are hiding their bigotry. Additionally, the series emits a warning that even those with ideas that seem too extreme to be rational can become powerful, especially because there are always more people ready to support them than expected.
The book fails to place Gilead—the name of the United States under the new order—in the context of the world. But the TV show includes a powerful episode in which a foreign ambassador arrives to inquire about the society, and possibly trade handmaids. As Offred, a handmaid and the main character, begs the ambassador not to trade the Handmaids who have been reduced to cattle, the ambassador cites that no child has been born in their country for six years and says, “My country is dying.” Offred looks her right in the eyes and replies, “My country is already dead.” By putting Gilead in a global context, the television series explains how the rest of the world could enable such an atrocious society to persist.
“The Handmaid’s Tale” is about to premiere its second season, allowing the creators to do something Atwood could not in a single novel: The show could easily evolve to portray a message about the state of the US. While the first few episodes feel like a basic retelling of the novel, the series has begun to carve its own way, with the help of Atwood’s input. Although Atwood’s book was powerful upon its release, the narrative has become even more poignant with its modern adaptation. Sadly, the present culture of the United States has made Atwood’s warnings more necessary and relevant than ever.

On April 16, celebrated director Sofia Coppola sat down for a moderated discussion and a Q&A with an emphatically appreciative audience at the Harvard Film Archive, following a screening of her critically-renowned 2017 film “The Beguiled.” The film is a Southern Gothic drama that explores the quiet hysteria of the lonely teachers and pupils—would-be debutantes—at a girls’ school on a plantation estate in the midst of the Civil War. Their world unravels upon the intrusion of a wounded Northern soldier played by Colin Farrell.
Coppola recalled her initial hesitance to re-make Donald Segal’s 1971 original, referencing her illustrious namesake. She said to a knowing audience, “Growing up in my household, the word ‘remake’ was a bad word.” But she expressed a desire to lend the feminine narrative often drowned out in overarching, male-centric narratives about the period. “I wanted to give these women a fair voice,” she said. She detailed her conscientious deviations from Segal’s version, having heightened the ambiguity of Farrell’s character to allow the audience to inhabit the mindset of the unwitting women. “We’ve all been in situations as women looking at men, like you probably shouldn’t trust him, but you want to,” she said. “I tried to be in their point of view of wanting to think he’s okay.”
Having worked as a costume designer before, Coppola elaborated on her diligent attention to aesthetic and sartorial detail. She commiserated with the women in their wistful delusion, recalling their “pageantry” involving faded dresses and dusty jewelry that they enact in anticipation of Farrell’s much-desired male presence. “They brought out all their dresses from Christmas and now they’re abandoned and totally on their own and they’re still holding onto this lifestyle that doesn’t exist anymore,” she said. “They’ve all had to wash these same dresses over and over, and they’re all kind of blending together, and I thought of them as being almost a bouquet of flowers.” Such exaggerated feminine frills provided visual contrasts to Farrell’s manifestation of rugged manliness. “When he comes, he’s in this faded, delicate, female world, and he’s dark and masculine and scruffy,” she said.
Coppola indulged her newfound fascination with the Gothic genre, elements of which are especially embodied by Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman), the school’s headmistress. In the film, Kidman wears her hair in wispy tendrils and at one point wields a candelabra. While shooting the film, Coppola recalls perceiving Miss Martha as a character who willfully, nostalgically justifies the soldier’s extended sojourn as a learning experience on entertaining men: “When we were shooting that scene, I was like, ‘Nicole, I really want that shot of you holding the candelabra saying, ‘Bring me the anatomy book.’ I was like, ‘That’s the trailer moment. We have to get that,’” she said. “That character could have been a total joke, a spoof, but Nicole took it seriously and really invested some humanity and made her sympathetic… [Miss Martha] really believed that she was helping these girls.”
Audience member Marina W. Wang ’19, a professed fan of Sofia Coppola’s “Lost in Translation,” said, “I have mixed feelings, because I thought there was this nice balance of the dark Gothic element but also humor... But I don’t know how much of the humor is intentional, because some of the dialogue seemed really awkward, and it just wasn’t realistic, but overall it was a great film, and it was definitely entertaining and thought-provoking.”
Coppola discussed the film’s wrought silences and briefly intense moments of sexual tension. “Subtext is always the interesting part of dialogue,” she said. “I’ve always liked the little details… They say so much when someone stands too close, or they almost kiss… Those moments are more impactful to me than full-blown emotions.”
Ilana A.D. Harris ’18, a sound artist, picked up on other eerie effects: The film’s motley soundtrack. She said, “[The credits] said that the music was by Phoenix but the music was inspired by Monteverdi, so [1600s, in addition to eight-plus] parts of moving blocks of vocal sounds is what [Monteverdi] wrote for, manipulated [by Phoenix] into this modern day electronic drone-like incarnation of that—I thought it was the coolest thing. I know Phoenix and Monteverdi but they’re polar opposites.”


“Even just the sound itself—when [Farrell] was sharpening the knife on the spinny-thing, and the water that was being poured, especially in the moments of tension when Nicole Kidman had the hand rag and she would fill it up with water and squeeze it, you could hear the water going swoosh,” Harris said. “So I really liked how [Coppola] used sound… All of the sounds were in very close proximity. Even at the get-go when the girl is walking and humming a tune, even though she walks further away, the tune is immediately very close to you. It was really incredible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew” poses a problem for academics: It is perhaps the play of all Shakespeare’s plays that most troublingly touches on gender issues and reflects a problematic treatment of women. Though it’s not entirely shocking that a play written in the 1590s would treat women as inferior, it is unfortunate that upon closer look it has been used as the basis for a conservative and post-feminist movie that many teenagers have come to love over the past two decades. Gil Junger’s “10 Things I Hate About You,” a 1999 high school romantic comedy starring heart throbs like Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has done two sneaky things. One, it has shown scores of unknowing high schoolers the plot of a Shakespearean novel. Two, it has reinforced the idea that strong-willed women should change their strong-willed personality to something softer if they ever want boyfriends.
Fortunately, Anne Tyler has saved the day. In her novel “Vinegar Girl,” a modern-day adaptation of “The Taming of the Shrew” that forms part of the Hogarth Shakespeare series, Tyler uses the plot to advocate for an inclusive feminism that directly contrasts with the message in both Shakespeare’s play and Junger’s film.
“The Taming of the Shrew” has drawn resentment from some critics for what they call its regressive ideology. The New York Times writer Lauren Collins-Hughes writes that she “has always hated ‘The Taming of the Shrew.’” Shakespeare’s play follows Katherina, the shrew, as Petruchio “tames” her, forcing her to become truly a docile wife instead of the headstrong and irritable woman she is. Katherina is subject to emotional abuse and is locked away to starve until she changes. At the end of the play, Katherina gives a speech that advocates for wives to behave in a deferential, totally compliant manner with their husbands. Undoubtedly, this is a far cry from how women should be treated, nonetheless, Junger chose to repurpose the play for a modern audience.
Though it came four centuries later, the well-loved 1999 teen rom-com adaptation is not as nice as it appears. Kat, Junger’s “shrew,” is a second-wave feminist at her core. But, the film depicts this as a flaw. She’s teased by her peers, who insinuate that she is a lesbian (which is a problematic accusation in its own right), and her younger sister is embarrassed by Kat. But by the end of the movie, Kat has “calmed down.” She no longer wants to do all the things she used to love and she has cast off her feminist views, all in order to date her crush. This embodiment of “manifest femininity”—the idea that all women really want is to be loved by men—is inherent in the relationships feautred in romantic comedies. But the concept is most striking in “10 Things I Hate About You” because the female lead literally changes her progressive stance on feminism to a conservative one in order to date a cute boy. Junger has not used this Shakespearean play to reiterate gender roles prevalent in the 16th Century (it would be absurd to imply wives are merely servants in a 1999 teen film) but he has made the point in this film that he believes feminism has no place in the modern world. Based on this film, feminism, in Junger’s eyes, has done its part to give women enough freedom and now it only serves to make women disagreeable and unattractive. Which, Junger seems to assert, is a woman’s (and man’s) worst nightmare.
Luckily, Anne Tyler disagrees. Though she had her pick of Shakespeare’s plays to adapt, Tyler chose “The Taming of the Shrew” and adapted it in a way that changes the message the play and its adaptations have been signaling for years. Tyler’s “shrew,” Kate, is considered as such because she is awkward and blunt. Kate’s father tries to persuade her to marry his international research assistant so he can obtain a green card. Kate resists and, even though she has not been romantically involved with anyone for years, she asserts she would rather live without love than be treated like a pawn. Kate’s final speech deals with gender roles in marriage, but that’s where the similarities to Shakespeare’s original end. After standing up for herself, Kate points out that men are also affected by gender roles. “Anything that’s bothering them, men think they have to hide it,”she says, marking an inclusion of men key to the sort of third-wave feminism that scoffs at Junger’s “post-feminist” views. There are still problems in this world. There is still work to be done. So undo the damage “10 Things I Hate About You” has done, and read Tyler’s “Vinegar Girl” to experience what a real modern day adaptation of Shakespeare’s most problematic play should be.

Rapacious politicians collaborate with powerful corporations to destructive consequences and the simmering rage of disgruntled, powerless citizens. This is the plot of so many legal dramas set in a thankfully distant reality. But in the case of “Little Pink House,” an unfortunately true story, the short-sighted political machinations of municipal figures have harrowingly larger-than-life consequences for the residents of an economically-depressed New London, Connecticut, that can be extrapolated to include all American citizens. The nightmare commences when a cadre of politicians collaborate with Pfizer Pharmaceuticals to redevelop land on which many residents have lived quietly for generations, on a waterfront that will soon become the province of new, wealthy residents. Susette Kelo (Catherine Keener), a soft-spoken paramedic and proud owner of a little pink house on that very land, helms a legal battle against the misuse of Eminent Domain, the right that governments reserve to seize private land for a purported public benefit, often for the construction of highways and hospitals.
The film, despite its unassuming treasure of a story—a homegrown, quietly heroic crusade made possible by Kelo’s admirable grit—falters in its ineffectual presentation. Balaker takes but a chunk out of a world rich in hypocrisy and complex and—most importantly—real figures with complicated motivations and lives. Balaker never sufficiently establishes Kelo’s backstory or coaxes foundational curiosity from her audience, and her politicians are generic incarnations of digital avatars, predictably pugnacious or laughably delusional. The story, which deserves more attention and wider emotional investment that it probably garners, suffers from so little dramatic embellishment that it becomes forgettable without a conscious appreciation of its salience.
Balaker seems devoted, and admirably so, to the bare-bones truth of the story and Kelo’s steadfast integrity, as she doesn’t adorn her film with cinematic frills or dramatic side characters that can serve as a counterpoint to the shy heroine and her wan deliveries. As the real Susette Kelo makes cameos toward the end of the film and in actual newsreels, Keener portrays Kelo’s quiet sincerity with remarkable perceptiveness. But the problem with a film that remains so true to its underdog and that isn’t visually exciting is that it bores. The beginning of the film is slow-moving and particularly wasteful because Kelo’s emotional backstory is hinted at, but confusingly so, in her will-they-or-won’t-they friendship with a local handyman (Callum Keith Rennie) that is inexplicably strained from the start.
The peripheral characters do not boast any more complexity. Charlotte Wells (Jeanne Tripplehorn), an immaculately kempt and ambitious municipal leader, smiles slyly into a phone while negotiating her part in the Pfizer deal with the governor (Aaron Douglas). Her steely composure and undeniable competence are pointlessly undermined by a randomly humorous comment she makes on the witness stand when asked for a “yes” or “no” answer: “I said yes at the end instead of at the beginning. That’s how the French frame their answers. I’ll try to think more Anglo-American.” Perhaps Balaker could have complicated the ethical questions at the heart of the film if Wells were truly delusional about her efforts to save the community she very distantly commands, instead of being so overtly conniving from the beginning. Other forgettable men appear on screen as they partake in meetings where they peacock and yell into phones, claiming slots in the film’s plot to do just that: Motion through the expected affectations of the soulless and faceless politicians in the popular imagination. They even use explicit narrative exposition. Early in the film, one man asks, “What the hell is New London?” Another dispensable politician responds with a wannabe zinger: “Absolutely nothing.”
Kelo’s case raises urgently important questions about the limits of governmental jurisdiction, and gestures toward the insidious ways in which government officials might misuse their rights under the guise of public service. In one of the most stirring moments, the real Susette Kelo stands bereft in an eerily empty, snow-glazed field where her charming pink house once stood. The film would most likely appeal to those who know Kelo’s story before they watch it, as they can probably bring complicating and thoughtful insight to the major plot points. It’s a tall order for a serious legal saga with so many moving parts and that is steeped in the unsavory brine of bureaucracy. But with a little more concentrated emotional floridity, Balaker could have hit the sweet spot between mawkishly sentimental and tediously informative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 150 years after it was painted, Édouard Manet's "Olympia" continues to astonish viewers with its subject’s challenging gaze and overt sexuality. Countless features and papers have discussed it because it is quite simply one of the most controversial works of the 19th century, so much so that guards have been forced to protect the painting from irate viewers. Yet the question still remains—more than a century and a half later, is it still as provocative as when it debuted?
French painter Édouard Manet (1832-1883), one of the originators of Impressionism, was known during his lifetime for painting portraits, marine landscapes, still lifes, and scenes of Parisian life with a unique style of brisk strokes. "Olympia" (1863) formed a clear departure from still lifes of dead rabbits. The painting is clearly linked to "Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe" (1863), another scandalous painting depicting two men having a picnic in a park with a naked woman as a scantily dressed bather relaxes behind them. The lounging position of the nude in "Déjeuner" is echoed in "Olympia," although in the latter she is the central figure. An emerald velvet curtain is pulled back to reveal Olympia—a name commonly used by prostitutes at the time—reclining on a bed facing the viewer while a black female servant presents her with a large bouquet of flowers and a black cat stands at her feet. Interestingly enough, while “Déjeuner” failed to be accepted by the Paris Salons, “Olympia” was not. If anything, its 1865 exhibition shocked the public even more than its predecessor, so much so that the painting had to remain under watch until it could be moved out of their reach.Critics were scandalized first by the subject: A prostitute receiving flowers from one of her clients. While nudes were accepted artistic subjects at the time, it was strictly within the context of mythic or allegorical works. The sheer size of this painting added to the fury because its subject was neither mythological nor historical—it was as if Manet were attempting to elevate a lower-class member of society. For this reason, he tried to defend himself by explaining that the form had been modeled off the reclining nude in "Venus of Urbino" (1538). By invoking Titian's established name, he hoped to defend himself from outrage. Yet Olympia's hand which rests over her pelvis and the cat at her feet are too suggestive to be ignored by viewers, especially considering that the French word "chatte" has the same double meaning as the English word "pussy." As to the painting style, there is no subtlety: Manet's broad strokes are so visible that the light is rendered extremely crudely. There is very little use of chiaroscuro (a technique employed to represent dimension using light and shadow) except for on Olympia's hand, so that its three-dimensional presence cannot help but draw the viewer's attention. Of course there is also her infamous arresting gaze, absolutely shameless and undaunted. Victorine Meurent, the model who posed for this painting, modelled for Manet many other times both clothed and nude—yet it is here that she is best remembered, her insouciance magnified and immortalized. Small details like the thin black choker around her neck, the orchid in her hair, her bracelet, and her mule slippers only make her feel more exposed—not that she seems to care. Critics did not take well to the black maid either, viewing her presence as adding to the painting's moral depravity. Given that slavery had been abolished in France only five years before, the maid's presence, for critics, only added to the sense of "inferiority" present in the painting. The contrast between the maid's ebony skin and Olympia's ashy complexion brings to the forefront the issue of racial division, but it also questions the difference in these women's respective positions within society—if we think of prostitution as modern slavery, how does this influence our perception of a woman whose skin color makes her property in another country? Is a prostitute classified as lower in status than her black maid? The distance between them, the sense that the maid is pulling away from her, and even the cat arching his back in fear raise these questions—and more. Olympia's large, expensive-looking bouquet, however, suggests she is more than a common prostitute. Thus her maid clad in a clean, light-colored dress, is not merely a common servant. Ultimately, the hierarchy is not clear. Perhaps that is what made critics most fearful.
Though Manet wields colors and shadows largely for composition, these stylistic elements are also indicative of the subjects' imposed morality. The black coloring, so often rather problematically representing darkness and corruption, is not simply restricted to the maid and the cat. Olympia's outline is tinged with it, too. Moreover her white skin is made impure by an underlying green hue symptomatic of venereal diseases like syphilis. In spite of her dark skin, the maid is clothed in a peachy dress, as if to illustrate further that the lines between immorality and purity are being blurred.
Part of what makes the painting so important to this day is its realism. It symbolizes both an artistic and literary moment fascinated with the lives of real people and their work. We may recognize the composition of "Olympia" in other paintings besides that of Titian, like in those by Goya and Ingres, but what makes “Olympia” so different is that it is not in the least idealized. The painting is a snapshot of real people. Just for a moment, we leave our own safe, sanitized lives and we are let into the reality of something much more disquieting. The curled edge of the curtain only reinforces the feeling that we are being let into a secret world.
Years after Manet painted “Olympia,” visitors at the top floor of the Musée d'Orsay will likely find that this painting continues to stand out among all the Impressionist masterpieces. And it always will. Crowds converge from all around the world to view the contours of Olympia's body. They come to stare and also to be stared at by her commanding eyes. The maid and her ambiguity are equally enticing. Who are the women in this painting? And is Olympia actually emblematic of the male gaze—does she exists as a morsel to be devoured by the public or is she the one devouring us? Look as we might, Olympia's cold stare does not return any sure answers, and this is the reason why we keep coming back to it after all this time.

BBC’s latest period four part mini-series, “Howards End,” has just come to Starz—and it is marvelous. Based on E. M. Forster’s much-loved novel, which was then made into the iconic 1992 film for which Emma Thompson won an Oscar, “Howards End” was burdened with high expectations. Yet this new adaptation, written by Kenneth Lonergan of “Manchester by the Sea” and directed by Hettie MacDonald, refreshingly enlivens the story. It manages to stand on its own with its skilled cast and gorgeous cinematography, and does a faithful job of unpacking the novel’s complexities while never losing sight of the overarching themes and main characters.
“Howards End” focuses on the lives of three families in London in the 1910s: the Wilcoxes, the Schlegels, and the Basts. The Wilcoxes are an affluent family who reside both in London and in a country house called Howards End. Henry Wilcox (Matthew Macfadyen) is a wealthy magnate and a steadfast capitalist, but only nominally the family patriarch. In fact, the Wilcoxes’ world revolves largely around Mrs. Ruth Wilcox (Julia Ormond), an enigmatic force bringing balance to the selfish family.
In contrast with the conservative Wilcoxes, the Schlegels are bohemian and progressive. After her parents’ death, Margaret (Hayley Atwell) raises her younger siblings Helen (Philippa Coulthard) and Tibby (Alex Lawther) in a large house in London on their large inheritance. This family, modeled after the Bloomsbury group, represents a brewing world of change and idealism. They spend their time smoking, reading Kant and Dostoevsky, attending classical concerts, and gallivanting to lectures on reform.
The novel’s conflict is set in motion after the Schlegels encounter Leonard Bast (Joseph Quinn), a lower-middle class insurance clerk. It is his interest in art that convinces the Schlegel sisters to help him financially. In a casting choice that diverges from the film adaption, Leonard’s wife Jacky is played by Rosalind Eleazar, a black woman. Although her race is never directly addressed, this directorial choice has undertones which will be important as Jacky’s history is revealed.
The casting is the show’s greatest strength. All three Schlegels are delightfully portrayed by their respective actors. Atwell brilliantly plays Margaret, bringing to life her maternal strength and compassion. Her excellent chemistry with Macfadyen, who plays Henry, sets up the seeds for their relationship from the start. The sparks between them make their eventual relationship completely believable, something with which even the 1992 film struggles. Lawry’s Tibby is another great addition, stealing all the scenes he is in with his deadpan humor. He delivers his lines monotonously, but always with the slightest tinge of irony. Tibby has the unbearable habit of talking over his other siblings, but in the hands of Lawry this is comedic and almost loveable.
Coulthard gives a nuanced portrayal of Helen. She plays the character with a sensitivity that makes Helen much more palatable, since she—despite her good intentions—could have come across as obnoxiously naïve in the wrong hands. Her arc is centered on her realizations about money: Even though she deplores it and the people who worship it, the great irony is that her inheritance supports her artistic and counter-culture lifestyle. With the innocence that she imbues in her character, Coulthard makes these revelations feel less obvious and thus less frustrating.
However, Coulthard’s scenes with Quinn never feel quite right. Perhaps because the nature of the relationship between Helen and Leonard is so bizarre—Helen’s interest in him is more akin to a subject in an experiment than as a man. Quinn’s Leonard is overall quite powerful. As Leonard’s   class and lack of finance continually thwart his desire for social mobility, he becomes more demoralized. Quinn shows this deterioration very carefully through hauntingly desperate looks and a constant trepidation in his movements.
The show’s setting is breathtaking, and the frequent panoramic shots put its beauty on display. As the show opens and ends with views of the idyllic world of Howards End there is a sense of closure despite the ever-changing nature of its residents. The shots of London are also varied, from the riches of the Wilcoxes’ flat to the grime of London’s poorer neighborhoods.
Altogether, these elements make the production a great success. Lonergan’s script keeps all the different threads of the show together. For a series like “Howards End,” structure is key especially as it can be difficult to follow the intricate plotlines. Perhaps its only fault lies in its pacing: It fails to show the passage of time, which can be quite confusing as there are rather large temporal leaps. Because of this, it feels as though very little time has passed between Ruth’s death and the marriage between Margaret and Henry. While such abrupt jumps in time might add a sense of urgency to drive the story forward, they feel unnecessary. Ultimately, “Howards End” doesn’t need this fast pace: It develops the story so well that it always keeps you guessing. With its stellar cast and depth, this production does just as well if not better then its Oscar-winning predecessor.

Sexism isn’t funny, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t the butt of many jokes at the annual Boston based Women in Comedy Festival. The event, which ran from April 18 to 22, brings in talented comics from all over the country. Although the event’s stated aim is to create a space where women make up a majority of the performers, some men performed as well. Despite entrenched sexism in the industry, the festival intended to both subvert expectations about gender and provide a platform for the empowerment of women. The festival celebrated the humor and accomplishments of women comics, while providing an opportunity for reflection on the challenges they faced.
Women are almost always outnumbered by men at comedy events. Only 10 percent of comedians are women, according to a 2014 Huffington Post article. Gina Yashere, who headlined the festival April 22 at the Rockwell in Somerville, says she is usually the only women comic at her performances.
“Every comedy show I’ve ever done, unless it’s a really important show, 90% of the shows I’ve done it’s white guy, white guy, white guy, white guy, me, white guy, white guy,” she says. “It’s always been that way.”
Julie Goldman, who performed on April 22 at Club Café, also says there are a limited amount of comedy shows dedicated to just women.
“I think it’s great that they’re doing a women in comedy festival because I don’t think there are that many,” Goldman says.

This festival provides a rare opportunity—for performers and audience members alike—to experience comedy in a space with greater gender and sexual diversity. Yashere emphasizes that the audience should have the opportunity to hear more than just white male voices.
Even though the narrative surrounding gender representation will pervade the festival, many of the comics instead prefer to look at the positives in the situation. Emma Willmann, who performed April 20 at the Brattle Theatre, looks to embrace the challenge of sexism in the industry.
“Whatever makes it harder for you in the beginning makes you stand out more in the end,” she says. The struggles faced by many of these comics help define their comedy and make events like the WICF more accessible and relatable to some audience members.

Some of the comics even believe their relegation by the industry has pushed their comedy in a positive direction. “I have to make sure I destroy every single time just to be considered as funny as the male comics,” Yashere says.
Through promoting women in comedy, the festival also opens additional opportunities and types of diversity for performers. With this atmosphere, the festival creates a more welcoming and open space for comics. The diversity could also encourage performers to employ different techniques and breach diverse content. Goldman looks forward to the diversity, likening the festival to a sort of rejuvenating bath. She enjoys her other sets, but there’s something refreshing about the energy generated by WICF. Additionally, according to Yashere, this was an opportunity to meet other women comics. “It’s about camaraderie, to get to see other female comics I’d never really get to see because they only book us one at a time,” she says.
These comics hope to leave the audience feeling changed in some way. Willmann says she hopes to entertain the audience so thoroughly that they walk away wanting to be friends with her. Goldman likens the venue to a classroom, hoping that she can provide a unique perspective to the audience, perhaps teaching them something significant in the process. Even though these artists create laidback spaces, the audience members still must be mindful to avoid offending. These types of events are about empowerment, not comparison. These shows are about breaking stereotypes, not reinforcing them.

5. Talya LavieTalya Lavie is the youngest and the least experienced filmmaker on this list, but that doesn’t mean she is the least interesting. Her debut feature, “Zero Motivation,” was released four years ago and has already become a cult film: It won six Ophir Awards (the Israeli Oscars) and was one of the most successful Israeli films in recent decades. The film, a hilarious black comedy depicting the life of female Israeli Defense Forces soldiers at a remote military base, revolutionized the portrayal of Israeli women on screen. Lavie herself was hailed as the pioneer of a new female wave. If you are not a fan of subtitled films, you can hold off on taking a Hebrew class: American comic actresses Amy Poehler and Natasha Lyonne are reportedly adapting the movie into an American TV series.
4. Samuel MaozSamuel Maoz almost became the first Israeli director to win an Academy Award—his recent sensational film, “Foxtrot,” was shortlisted, but did not ultimately receive a nomination. Even without the golden statue, Maoz can be proud of himself: He will go down in history as the creator of one of the most controversial movies in Israel. The film, described by the director as “a Greek tragedy in three sequences,” tells the story of Michael and Dafna, a Tel Aviv couple who learn that their son, Jonathan, died while serving as an IDF soldier. If that sounds intriguing, you might also want to check out Maoz’s first feature film, “Lebanon.” It is based on the director’s experience as a soldier during the 1982 Lebanon war and is mostly shot from inside a tank.
3. Joseph CedarIn a way, Joseph Cedar accomplished the dream that was just out of reach for Samuel Maoz. Cedar’s 2007 “Beaufort,” depicting the story of the IDF withdrawal from southern Lebanon, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The movie lost to the Austrian-German drama “The Counterfeiters,” but that wasn’t the end of Cedar’s romance with Hollywood. Two years ago he released his most recent film, “Norman,” starring Richard Gere and Israeli actor Lior Ashkenazi. But Cedar’s true magnum opus is actually his 2011“Footnote,” which was nominated for an Oscar as well. It follows the complex relationship between a father and son who teach at the same department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
2. Ronit and Shlomi ElkabetzIf you’ve read this far, you may have noticed that the military service and the IDF are recurring themes in Israeli movies. While this impression is often corroborated in the Israeli film canon, that is not always the case. The sister-and-brother team of Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz is known for expanding the boundaries of Israeli cinema. The two created films that innovatively dealt with yet unexplored themes like Mizrachi Jewish families (Jews descended from the Middle East) and the degradation of women in Israeli religious courts. Their heart-breaking trilogy—“To Take a Wife,” “Shiva,” and “Gett”—is a must-see for those interested in contemporary Israel. Ronit Elkabetz died in 2016 at 51, but her unparalleled, prolific career as an actress and filmmaker left a mark on Israeli culture that many more artists would find hard to match.
1. Ari FolmanProbably the most well known director on the list, Ari Folman is one of the most fascinating and internationally acclaimed figures in Israeli cinema. His 2008 documentary “Waltz with Bashir” premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and went on to win and be nominated for basically every important international award. It was the first animated film to have received a nomination for the Oscars and the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film and a César Award for Best Foreign Film (the French Oscars). His next project was “The Congress,” a captivating animated sci-fi drama starring Robin Wright, released in 2013. And his upcoming film sounds even more compelling: An animated version of Anne Frank’s diaries.

The beginning of “Chapter 11” of “Legion” is a little misleading. It starts off with yet another blatantly philosophical, time-wasting explainer. A new tic of Season Two, these typically take place in a sterilized white void room, as our omniscient narrator tries and fails to challenge the age-old “show don’t tell” rule. So far, the lessons have either been completely irrelevant or pointlessly repetitive of the show’s actual content. This time, “Chapter 11” spends three minutes explaining the nocebo effect, something I could’ve read about on Wikipedia faster.
“Chapter 11” doesn’t start off well, but makes up for it by actually paying attention to the characters—the hearts of the show—rather than the episode’s aesthetics. That isn’t to say that “Chapter 11” isn’t beautiful. In fact, “Chapter 11” demonstrates some of the most deceptively simple—yet powerful—camerawork and lighting design of “Legion.” As David (Dan Stevens) and Farouk (Navid Negahban) argue in the astral plane, the camera swings back and forth like a pendulum, creating a constant unease as Farouk upends David’s own perception of himself. “[Syd] lives in a future you are trying to change, and when you do, she will cease to exist,” Farouk says. “So really, you are helping her to commit suicide.” Everything is cast in a suspiciously idyllic golden glow under a too-blue sky, a design choice repeated when “Legion” wants to convey that something just isn’t quite right, no matter how pretty the scene.
Similar lighting washes over Ptonomy’s (Jeremie Harris) own visualization of his happy place, a garden-maze carved from roses. And while Ptonomy is able to blissfully forget for the first time (his superpower is everlasting memory), the warm glow tells us to not buy into this fabricated fantasy. We learn of Ptonomy’s innermost desire, but know that it’s time to return to reality.
This seems to be the formula for “Chapter 11.” The bulk of the episode feels like it’s split into segments, with each piece detailing the wishes or fears of certain characters, and how they must reconcile them with reality’s own, often cruel, dictations. Lenny (Aubrey Plaza) is still stuck in her purgatory, bodiless and sustained only by Farouk’s power which puts her under his control. Kerry (Amber Midthunder) must figure out how to perform simple and, for her, confusing human functions, like eating or pissing, after being thrust out of the safety of Cary’s (Bill Irwin) body. And a powerful monk (Nathan Hurd) starts terrorizing Division Three, sending David’s friends into a mindless, teeth-chattering frenzy in which they are trapped in their own minds. Melanie (Jean Smart) catches a viral-like infection, and has to come to terms with how her life and her dreams have revolved around a man whom she may never see again.
Almost every show has an episode in which characters are forced to explore their hopes and worries, and it may even feel cliché at this point to construct an episode that does this so explicitly. But after two episodes of weak plotlines and uninteresting character development of David and Syd (Rachel Keller), digging deeper into these characters’ minds feels both necessary and satisfying. It isn’t enough to have nebulous threats from the future to drive home a story—there needs to be actual substance, and “Chapter 11” delivers.
In my last review, I mentioned that David’s inner conflict with “being the good guy” was, to be candid, boring, especially considering that it really seemed like David was doing the best he could with what he had. But “Chapter 11” turns that on its head. “I’m a refugee. Do you know the meaning of that word? Refugee. Driven from my home, in exile. Prisoner in another man’s body,” Farouk says, alluding to when David’s father essentially banished Farouk from his home. “Nobody put you in my head,” David replies. “Or Oliver’s. You made a choice.” But even before Farouk, the villain of the series, responds, the rationale behind his decisions suddenly become startling clear, while David’s moral allegiances delve deeper into murky grounds. It’s this moment when “Legion”’s second season finally finds its substance, the complicated emotional work that truly-gratifying TV shows are made up of.
“Of course.” Farouk responds. “If the choice is between death or life, I choose life.”

It is commonly accepted that discussions about Israel and Palestine always turn sour. Time and again, I am warned not to engage in these sorts of discussions, whether on Facebook or in-person, because “nothing good ever comes out of them.” It seems that people think compromise, civil discourse, and mutual understanding are impossible when it comes to the issue of Israel-Palestine, perhaps more than any other topic. Even on campus, one seldom can find a group of students participating in a fruitful and intellectually honest conversation regarding Israel-Palestine.
The conflict is too often painted as black and white, or a zero-sum game. People ask what side you are on as though they are asking if you root for the Red Sox or Yankees. Painting the conflict in such a light is not only simplistic but is highly damaging to the prospect of a peaceful solution. How can anyone who is emotionally connected to either the Zionist or Palestinian causes show any sort of sympathy to the other side when it is categorically portrayed as negative and harmful? A more peaceful Middle East and coexistence between the Israeli and Palestinian people must begin by acknowledging the legitimacy of each side’s narrative.
Yet I don’t think it has to be this way. Cara J. Kupferman ’20 and I, along with over a dozen other students, are forming a new group on campus dedicated to promoting peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples called the Coalition at Harvard for Israel and Palestine. We seek to provide an alternative space where pro-Israel, pro-peace students can discuss and advocate for justice for both peoples.
We are establishing CHIP because we are deeply committed to ensuring Israel’s future as the democratic homeland of the Jewish people, which can only be secured through a two-state resolution. We will organize as students to act together on behalf of a two-state solution and a more peaceful, secure, and democratic future for both Israelis and Palestinians. In so doing, we strive to bring to our campus and our communities an inclusive, pragmatic, and values-driven conversation able to meet the urgency and seriousness of the challenge that we face.
The current conversation regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, both within Harvard’s Jewish and Arab communities and on campus as a whole, lacks nuance—by depicting the other side as complicit in either ethnic cleansing or terrorism—and recognition of the legitimacy of the other group’s narrative. It is crucial for the future generation of leaders to engage in meaningful and honest dialogue, and we believe that we can fill this serious void.
Additionally, it becomes impossible to respond to any contemporary challenge in the region when one views the conflict through a strictly dogmatic lens. For example, regarding the current violence at the Gaza-Israel border, one need not side unequivocally with either the terrorist group Hamas or the often-disproportionate responses of the Israeli army. Regarding the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, anyone who cares about peace would be misguided to criticize Israel without recognizing the Palestinian government’s incitement and incentivizing of terrorism; and one would be similarly misguided to attack Palestinian terrorism without condemning the tremendously negative effects of an ever-present and often-brutal military occupation.
When Palestinians’ primary interaction with Israelis is with soldiers who patrol their communities and raid their homes, and when Israelis’ primary contact with Palestinians is with knife-wielding assailants, how can one expect mutual understanding? Similarly, when the conversation in the United States is dominated by extremists like Louis Farrakhan or American ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman, how can one expect nuance and intellectual honesty?
I believe it is important to bring speakers to our community, in order to educate our members and the Harvard community about ongoing issues in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank and to shed light on the injustices of the occupation as we seek to promote a two-state solution, a secure and democratic Israel, and justice for both Israelis and Palestinians.
In a time in which centrist voices are too frequently drowned out, it is important to stake out our position between those who defend the increasingly authoritarian tendencies of the current Israeli administration and those who mercilessly slander the only liberal democracy in the region. It is vital to affirm that—just as President Donald Trump does not speak for all Americans and there are many patriots who vehemently oppose his administration and his policies—Hamas and Abbas do not represent all Palestinians and, likewise, one can be both Zionist and anti-Netanyahu.
It is tempting to avoid talking about difficult issues like Israel and Palestine or to dismiss the narrative of one side while unquestioningly adopting the agenda of the other. Yet, as a leader of the newly formed Coalition at Harvard for Israel and Palestine, I urge all students to lean in and engage in the challenging project of promoting mutual understanding and a peaceful solution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nicholas:  This semester, we’ve been trying to capture the essence of student advocacy and activism in our column. This has been, in part, a selfish project. While we hope our words have had some small impact on our readers, we also know that they have helped us come to terms with our own identities as student advocates and activists. We have developed our own conceptions of and philosophies on the work we do in the public eye. We have learned about the history of our work, and contemplated its future. We have become better public servants for writing this column.
And yet this semester the two of us decided to quit the Undergraduate Council, the primary platform of our public service.  There are multiple reasons for this decision, but perhaps the most pressing is also the most simple, and most selfish: We are tired, and the work we do isn’t sustainable. In this column we’ve discussed the weight that pain and exhaustion place on activists. And now, that weight has—not forever, but for now—gotten the better of us.
Salma: I’ve been on the Undergraduate Council for a year and a half now. It’s been a learning and growing opportunity for me, built on a lot of pain. The UC is where I learned how toxic the subtleties of misogyny can be, how the small things—being interrupted constantly, incessant questioning and doubt about the value of the work I produce, and the lack of credit and credibility afforded to women on the Council—could be internalized, making me feel smaller and less competent.
The UC is also where I learned that institutional change, especially at Harvard, takes more than just time. It requires hell-raising, passion, drive, anger and, on top of that, the energy necessary to quell that fire, to guide that fire in the right direction, to make sure it doesn’t consume us. I’m proud of the victories we’ve had on the Council. Nicholas, you successfully pushed for the establishment of a caucus system to ensure minority representation on the Council. A physical space for belonging seems more like a possibility now than it has ever before. But I’m starting to question—are these successes worth it?
N: It’s hard for us to write these words, because it feels like a failure. I wish I could continue to invest time and energy into the Council, even in spite of the too-often structural and cultural toxicities woven into the organization. I feel a responsibility to continue, a responsibility to the communities beyond myself. And failing to fulfill that responsibility feels wrong.
But it’s a failure I’ll have to swallow. The “tireless” activist is a myth. Sometimes the exhaustion cannot be surmounted. Modern activism is a never-ending and soul-crushing assembly line. “Activists” are interchangeable pawns for movements rather than humans in their own right. Movements are subsumed into the status quo, allowing it to refresh itself by normalizing discontent. The status quo is (and will be for the foreseeable future) systemic oppression. Thus the interchangeable activist becomes a constantly-refreshed feature of “the way things are.”
Is it any wonder, then, that we are tired? This activism is unsustainable.
S: My energies thus far have been mostly invested in fixing and improving our campus community. That’s what has defined my experience on the UC has been so far. I’ve found myself constantly butting heads with this age-old institution and its traditions. And for what? The change we’ve made here has been incremental at best, and those who see its benefits are already some of the most privileged members of our society, just by nature of the fact that we go to Harvard. The work we have done is not radical because it exists in an inherently elitist and exclusive institution. If there are any boundaries we have pushed, they have not extended beyond these gates.
I’m proud of the work I’ve done on campus, but it’s time to move forward, to expand my advocacy to the issues that exist outside of the walls of our classrooms and extracurriculars. I’m doubling down on advocacy around the issues that I care deeply about beyond the Harvard bubble—prison reform and community empowerment and engagement for those who have been most marginalized. I’m working hard to understand my own privileges and how, despite existing at the intersection of so many marginalized identities, I can nonetheless be an oppressor. My foremost priority moving forward is understanding my positionality and remedying the harm my existence as a student here has caused.
So the question becomes: Where do we go from here, from this place of failure, defeat, and destruction? Right now, my answer is reinvesting in the world beyond Harvard. We’re going back to communities, with the skills we’ve acquired from our work on campus repurposed.
N: One of the most incredible experiences I’ve had at Harvard has been performing and producing for BlackCAST, Harvard’s only Black theater student organization. Being surrounded by a community of Black artists was life-changing. In that communal space I felt more meaningfully engaged and more tapped into the needs of my community than I ever felt as a member of the Undergraduate Council. And this is not to say that I am not proud of the work I did as a Council member, or that it wasn’t important, and that it mustn’t be done. But it is to say that without BlackCAST, I would’ve “burned out” a long time ago. Without a space where my activism could become more communitarian, more viscerally personal, more about me as a human being than me as an “agent of change”, the assembly line would’ve run me ragged far sooner.
As a member of BlackCAST, I joyfully experienced a new sense of activism, one far removed from the assembly line of modern activism. This, I think, is the same kind of activism you describe, Salma, one that thrusts us back into the community by making us see ourselves not as replaceable cogs in the assembly line but as human members of that community. In this new activism, the humanity of the activist and the people they serve is highlighted above all else. This is an activism that finds itself in critical self-examination, in understanding the ways in which oppression is lived and breathed. This is an activism that finds itself in spaces of joyful creation as much as in institutional bureaucracy. This is an activism that presupposes self-care, and validates the rage and pain of activists. This is a radical activism. This is where we go from here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 24, 2018, at 11:51 a.m.
In Adams House’s renovation, history, modernity, and accessibility are set to become one.
Starting in the spring of 2019, Adams House is slated to undergo renovation. This comes in the context of the University’s push for housing renewal, with renovations already having taken place in all of Dunster and Winthrop Houses, and some of Quincy and Leverett Houses.
Unlike what is occurring in the ongoing Lowell House renovations, not all Adams residents will be required to live in swing housing at any given time. Since Adams consists of three separate buildings, as some undergo renovation, students who live in the other buildings can continue to do so.
From the Gold Room to Westmorly Court, Adams is filled with history—a history that should be preserved to the greatest extent possible. Thus, it is welcome news that the Cambridge Historical Commission will not allow the exterior of Adams to be changed. Furthermore, we are excited to hear that plans for Adams are seeking to preserve its more unique and nuanced historical features, including the Coolidge Room, the elliptical stairs in Randolph Hall, the lobby of Claverly Hall, the pool theater, and the suite of former President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904.
This is in line with the desires of Adams students, who made their views known during a town hall. It’s a welcome sign that the architects have solicited student input during the beginning stages of the renovation process, and should to do so to an even greater extent as they continue their work.
In this vein and in line with the requests of Adams residents, the architects should continue to keep as much of the quirky, historical features of the House as possible—it is these facets that make Adams House unique. Indeed, other historic parts of Adams House are just as worthy of preservation, including the underground tunnels decorated by Adamsians past, the ornately designed Gold Room, the stunning House library, and much more.
However, at the moment, the only elevator in Adams is in Claverly Hall, and by the end of renovations, architects plan for there to be eight all around the House, and for all entryways to be accessible. This prioritization of accessibility is commendable, in that it works to make the House safe and inclusive. A continued emphasis on this aspect of renovation should be a key aim of the architects.
The renovation also allows for increased social space within the House, as students have requested. Students in other renovated Houses have explained that the loss of their own common rooms in suites to larger, public common rooms or off-corridor doubles constitutes a large loss to their ability to be social with other students. Those who have influence in the renovation should therefore listen to feedback from students from recently-renovated houses—particularly Dunster, Quincy, and Winthrop Houses—and emphasize the design of many suites with private common rooms. Not only would this demonstrate that those in charge of the renewal of Adams House have listened to the voices of students unhappy with this specific aspect of the renovations in other Houses, it will also facilitate a sense of community in Adams House and set an admirable precedent for future renovations.
In that vein, as each House is renewed, administrators and architects alike should be learning more about how to best renovate for undergraduate residential life at Harvard, and we hope they apply the lessons they should have learned to the particular case of Adams House correctly and with due diligence.

CORRECTION: April 24, 2018
A previous version of this editorial incorrectly stated the organization that is not allowing Adams House's exterior to be changed. It is the Cambridge Historical Commission, not the Cambridge Historical Society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I recently revisited Richard Hofstadter’s 1955 essay “The Pseudo-Conservative Revolt,” and I have to say, I was struck by how relevant it is to our time.
Hofstadter originally published the essay to explain the rise of his generation’s alt-right: A loose coalition of conspiracist anticommunists that opposed President Dwight D. Eisenhower, public works projects, and free speech. A cornered animal of sorts, the pseudo-con regularly made fretful lunges in defense of its political life. It was the woman who complained about “eight more years of socialism” after Eisenhower’s 1952 election. It was the delegate to the Omaha Freedom Congress who denounced Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren for his “middle-of-the-road” thinking and, paradoxically, his supposed communist sympathies.
Jarred as I was by these profiles in paranoia, I found my attention drawn elsewhere in the essay: Hofstadter’s remark that only two decades prior, “the dynamic force in American political life came from the side of liberal dissent.” The contrast that Hofstadter perceived between the 1930s and the 1950s—the former defined by liberal aspirations for reform, the latter by a guttural conservative reaction—felt familiar.
We liberals seem to have a knack for rendering ourselves obsolete. When the stock market crashed in 1929, a generation of likeminded policymakers and activists now remembered as the “New Dealers” rallied behind the platform of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, for public works, Social Security, and expanded regulation. But by the 1950s, Republicans had won back the presidency and both houses of Congress. Suspicions of a secret liberal pact with communism had the left in spasms. The country was closer to a party-wide purge than ever before. The question loomed among liberals: How did we get here?
One answer argues that the New Dealers simply over-delivered. The large mass of men undone by the Depression had found new work and respectable housing. Social safety nets promised a modicum of respect for the unemployed and elderly. Even women could, in a limited way, pursue work. One might argue that, in the aggregate, these victories meant that the left had finally put its motivating anxieties to bed.
While certainly true in part, this explanation seems to diminish the stakes of the liberal agenda after Roosevelt. I find Hofstadter’s assessment more exciting: that “[a]fter twenty years the New Deal liberals [had] quite unconsciously taken on the psychology of those who have entered into possession.”
Democrats back then “could look back,” writes Hofstadter, “to a brief, exciting period in the mid-thirties when they had … been able to transform the economic and administrative life of the nation.” Apart from that, though, the Democrats were parched for rhetoric. They had no new futures planned.
This criticism still bites today. In 2016, it was thought by some that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton represented President Barack Obama’s third term. Even as some Democrats worked to disavow this view, others on the left—including Obama—embraced it, if in thinly veiled terms. Embedded in these tactics was Hofstadter’s old psychology of possession, which treated Hillary as the heir apparent to the 2008 Democratic wave.
It lurks elsewhere too. In the run-up to the 2018 midterm election cycle, the Democratic National Committee has drafted a number of potential party slogans, some more inspiring than others. Among the least inspiring options from last summer, and one that gained serious traction, was the comical jab, “I mean, have you seen the other guys?” The implication is that the Democrats have a monopoly on dignity. Though perhaps true, this attitude reflects a strong possessive sense. We Democrats are the gatekeepers of dignified politics: You pass through us.
For good or ill, the country has become ensnared in decades-old politics. Senator Bernie Sanders, a socialist in the American tradition of Eugene v. Debs, made a credible bid for the presidency. President Donald Trump has resurrected the “America First” slogan not bandied about since before the Second World War. American Nazis are making news from Charlottesville to Georgia to the heartland. In this environment, the psychology of possession among liberals becomes more dangerous. It dampens the dynamism of liberal dissent.
I sense that liberals can recover the “dynamic force in American political life” that Hofstadter praised. But that path requires leaving certain baggage behind: The nostalgia for the Obama coalition, the disdain for 2016’s “deplorables.” These are political dead-ends.
The path also requires rallying to new dangers: A worsening trade war with China, a humanitarian disaster in Syria, vulnerable immigrant and refugee communities at home. For Democrats, as for America, the stakes lie here, among the electoral base.
Most important, though, will be a profound sense of humility. The 2016 election proved that we liberals are not guaranteed victories in the way we were with presidents Bill Clinton and Obama. Times have changed. Partisan allegiances have deepened. Administrations are not so easily guilted into responsible politics.
In this world, any movement of dynamic dissent must earn its keep. Hofstadter saw the decline of a robust left movement into a contest with pseudo-cons for power. As we watch a similar contest unfold, we ought to remember the dangers of our possessive tendencies, to avoid them the next time around.

There are few places with more nail biting per capita than a hospital waiting room. I’m doing it, the strangers in the faux leather chairs with thinly veiled panic on their faces are doing it, and even a few of the nurses are doing it when they’re on break. It’s a familiar scene, just around the corner from the beeping machines and blinking lights of the ICU. The walls are bleached and the coffee tables covered with piles of magazines you only ever see in a medical office. Families wander in and out, waiting for any news.
It’s supposed to be a room full of distractions—the magazines, the vending machines, a low-volume TV in the corner—and yet there’s nothing to do. I spent several weeks of my sophomore winter break in one of those rooms. You go long enough and you can recognize the regulars, learn which chairs are the best ones because they have a plug underneath, know a little more than you wanted to about the daytime programming lineup of the hospital TV network.
One thing you can do is pray. I grew up going to church, and, though faith has always been an important part of my identity, religion often felt like an intellectual exercise. I believed in what I’d been taught, but almost never did I feel the supernatural stirring in my heart. I didn’t imagine that much about my faith would change when I was surrounded, for a few weeks, by donuts and daytime television at the hospital.
I also didn’t imagine that much about my faith would change during four years at college.
Harvard is often pilloried as liberal and secular—and not completely without reason. Richard Nixon once called it the Kremlin on the Charles, and the Soviets were not exactly known for their religious fervor. The Divinity School equivocates on its belief in the divine. I’ve heard undergrads describe themselves as CEOs: Christmas and Easter Only. Harvard can seem too harsh for something as abstract- and naive-seeming as religious faith.
I hadn’t come to Cambridge seeking spiritual transformation. I imagined instead that I’d see the intellectual, personal, and social transformation that the brochures and speeches promised. I don’t think I knew exactly what that meant—it seems to have developed a common meaning vaguely evocative of finding yourself in an amorphous college-y sort of way—but I was sure it lay in my future.
I loved freshman year. I loved the knock-out, drag-out fights about politics with my roommates at 3 a.m. I loved the feeling of complete self-responsibility, able to pop out for pizza or a burger at all hours of the night. I loved (though slightly less) having to make all new friends. I also joined a faith community and attended a local church, but I expected my religious life to mirror the patterns I’d come to know back home.
Sophomore year was harder. I remember aimlessly walking down the banks of the Charles on the Friday before Thanksgiving, upset about extracurriculars and ready to leave campus. I called home to vent, and instead I got the news: Thanksgiving would be different this year. That weekend was the first time I spent any serious amount of time in a hospital. As it turned out, waiting rooms would swallow up not only Thanksgiving but also most of January.
In the months that followed after I returned to campus, I found myself spending more time with people I knew from church and trying to attend weekly Bible studies—a sort of section for Scripture—more regularly. I showed up for more Friday worship nights and Sunday after-church brunches, getting drawn further into a community of faith. I came to rely on it.
Equally important were the moments alone. Helplessness appeared not only at bedsides but also looking down the barrel of one too many papers, one too many exams, one too many emails that needed a reply. There were nights in my dorm room or in my office at The Crimson when the only thing that felt right to do—the only thing I knew how to do—was to pray and read Scripture. Those moments, like those days in the waiting room, clarified that belief is just that—the desperately optimistic hope that what’s to come must be, has to be, good.
I found solace in prayer. It is, to be quite honest, a crazy thing. I clean my room for fun. I am afraid of heights. I love my Google Calendar. I’m risk-averse and logical. Prayer is throwing a bottle into the ocean and hoping someone will catch it. It’s a practice profoundly shocking in its suggestion that my words could reach beyond our world, and yet profoundly humbling in its reminder that so little is ultimately in my hands.
No doubt many Harvard folks would describe this as the placebo of belief. Perhaps I am conditioned to see serendipity as spirituality and quick to see purpose behind coincidence. Perhaps they are right.
But on a campus supposedly filled with godless communists, I found joy in a thriving spiritual community: comfort amid family illness, support amid academic burdens, peace amid stress. In faith, I got the intellectual, personal, and social transformation that Harvard promised me.
It is faith that brings the overwhelming sense of peace that I sometimes feel on early walks to class. It’s the fresh morning air in my lungs, the uneven cobblestones under my feet, and, from the solace of prayer, a hope for the day that is just beginning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Andover Shop—a Harvard Square staple selling menswear and formal attire—is up for sale after 65 years on Holyoke Street and 70 years in Andover, Mass.
Store owners Charlie Davidson and Virgil Marson will be selling the shop and the property that it occupies in the coming months, with the hope that new owners will keep the brand alive.
The Holyoke Street store is one of two locations of the Andover Shop. The store’s first location, operated by Davidson’s brother-in-law Virgil Marson and located in namesake Andover, Mass., is also up for sale. Cambridge store manager Lawrence D. Mahoney said they are working to attract a buyer that will keep both stores open and maintain the Andover Shop brand and tradition.
The Andover Shop has been a Harvard Square staple since 1953 and a go-to formal wear shop for generations of Harvard students and Cantabrigians. Mahoney said he believes the community the store has developed over the past 65 years is a main reason that its new owners would benefit from continuing the brand.
“We have relationships with our customers and they are really members of an extended family; you know, multigenerational,” Mahoney said. “There’s definitely community.”
One customer, who had stopped in the store to talk to Mahoney, said he has been shopping at the Andover Shop since attending Harvard in the mid-1970s.
Mahoney also remarked on the store’s collection of well-known customers.
“It’s a very unique place in that you can come in and be buying a pair of pants next to a former Supreme Court justice or world-class cellist,” Mahoney said.
The Andover Shop has faced significant challenges in recent years due to Harvard’s ongoing construction of the Smith Campus Center right across the street.
According to Mahoney, road closures from the construction over the last two and a half years have hurt the store’s sales. He said these challenges contributed to the decision to sell the stores.
“Street traffic has been reduced significantly and that’s had a negative effect,” Mahoney said. “Harvard has not been a good neighbor through the whole process.”
Mahoney said Harvard was required to reimburse the City of Cambridge for its lost parking meter revenue.
“Which for me sets a standard that says they should compensate the businesses for the lost revenues,” Mahoney said.
A Harvard spokesperson declined to comment on the Andover Shop specifically, but emphasized that the University has made ongoing efforts to minimize the impact of construction on local streets and businesses by keeping sidewalks open and providing ample signage.
Other Holyoke Street businesses have also faced challenges due to disruptive construction. Mediterranean restaurant En Boca closed its doors in June 2017—just eight months after opening—due to frustrations with the ongoing construction. En Boca has since sued Harvard for “breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, nuisance” and other violations related to the renovation process.
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that when the Smith Campus Center opens, it will likely bolster business in the area.
“The enhanced public spaces, new local retail tenants, and diverse programming will ensure that the Smith Center becomes a destination that attracts additional visitors and residents to the area,” O’Rourke wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pierre R. Berastaín Ojeda ’10 has been appointed director of the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the University announced Monday, marking the end of a nearly one-year period in which the office lacked a permanent leader.
OSAPR provides counseling and sexual assault prevention resources for University affiliates independent from Harvard’s Title IX office and Office for Dispute Resolution. For the past 11 months, Maria Francesconi, senior director for nursing and health promotion at Harvard University Health Services, has served as acting director.
The office’s previous director, Alicia Oeser, announced last May she planned to step down to assume a similar role at the University of California, Los Angeles. In recent months, OSAPR restructured staffing within its office as it continued to search for a permanent director.
Francesconi wrote in an emailed statement that student involvement in the hiring process and another leadership change in the office contributed to the delay in hiring Oeser’s replacement.
“Because student participation in the hiring process for this position is paramount, we delayed our search until students arrived back to campus in the fall,” Francesconi wrote. “As we began our work to post the position, the OSAPR associate director announced her resignation in September of 2017.”
“Given this position’s integral role in directing service and education to students, we shifted our hiring process to prioritize filling this position,” she added.
Administrators hired a replacement associate director in late 2017, according to Francesconi. The director search officially launched in Dec. 2017 and concluded last month, she said.
Berastaín previously served as the assistant director of the National Latin@ Network for Healthy Families and Communities, a federally funded Latino-specific institute that works to combat gender-based violence in the United States.
Francesconi specifically pointed to Berastaín’s experience working those who have experienced harassment.
“He has proven to be a passionate advocate for civic engagement, the BGLTQ community, and domestic and dating violence survivors,” she wrote.
University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release Monday that she is “so pleased” to welcome Berastaín to his new role, especially in light of ongoing national and local conversations about sexual harassment. An Oct. 2017 report in the New York Times detailing allegations of sexual harassment against famed producer Harvey Weinstein sparked a nationwide reckoning with sexual assault, typified by the social media campaign “#MeToo,” which urges those who have experienced sexual harassment to come forward with their stories.
“As we have been reminded all too vividly in recent months, sexual harassment and assault continue to be frustratingly persistent problems on campuses and beyond,” Faust wrote in the press release announcing Berastaín’s appointment. “Our commitment to creating a Harvard where every member of our community can reach their full potential free from the scourge of sexual misconduct requires that we put in place the resources and structures that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Berastaín’s selection comes at a time when the University is facing conversations about sexual harassment closer to home, too. The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in March that at least 18 women are accusing Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of repeated acts of sexual harassment over the past three decades. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed Dominguez on paid administrative leave and has filed a formal complaint with the University’s Office of Dispute Resolution as part of this process. Dominguez has announced he plans to retire.
Berastaín said in a press release that he is pleased to return to Harvard, where he studied as an undergraduate and pursued post-graduate work researching gender-based violence and restorative and transformative justice at the Divinity School.
“I am excited to return to my alma mater, and I am encouraged by the deep level of commitment my colleagues have expressed to create an inclusive, safe, and healthy environment for our community,” Berastaín said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years after the Corporation accepted a proposal to remove the controversial crest of a slave-owning family from the Law School’s official seal, the school has yet to decide on a replacement.
The former seal featured the crest of the family of Isaac Royall Jr., whose donation to the Law School in the late 18th century eventually funded the first Harvard professorship of law. The Royall family owned slaves on a plantation in Antigua and Barbuda as well as their house in Medford. Student activists formed a group dubbed Royall Must Fall in 2015 and called on the school to change the seal.
After a months-long deliberative process, a Law School committee recommended in March 2016 that Harvard change the seal. The Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—approved that recommendation later that month.
At the time, Law School spokesperson Robb London told The Crimson the school would select a new seal by 2017, in time for the school’s bicentennial celebration.
That celebration is now nearing its end—but the school remains seal-less.
In an interview last month, Dean of the Law School John F. Manning ’82 said administrators have been focused on the school’s capital campaign and the bicentennial. He said officials will initiate the process of adopting a new seal at a later date.
“It’s been a very busy year,” Manning said. “We’ve had a very packed year with the bicentennial celebration, with the final year of the campaign, and this year we’ve had the bicentennial logo; HLS 200 has been on all of our mugs and sweatshirts and hats. We will think about replacing the seal at some future point.”
Manning added he wants to ensure the process for choosing a new seal is “fair and effective” and that he is gathering input from Law School affiliates about what that process might look like.
“We want to think about what is a fair and effective process for identifying a new seal,” Manning said. “This is my first year as dean, I’ve been going around and had lots of interaction with the community, with faculty, staff, students, and alumni, and in coming up with decision-making processes, it helps me to hear from a lot of constituents."
"I’m dealing with a lot of lawyers and a lot of people who care about Harvard Law School, and so I’m asking around to see what people think would be a good process for identifying a new shield,” he added.
After the Corporation agreed to remove the Royall seal two years ago, the Law School worked quickly to remove it from campus and from Law School websites. While the endeavor was mostly successful, the seal was still visible at some locations on the Law School campus last year. The three wheat sheaves of the Royall crest remain in at least one location on campus—the door of a Harvard-owned property at 10 Mt. Auburn St.
Matthew Gruber, dean for administration at the Law School, wrote in an email Monday that, in the months since the initial effort to remove the Royall crest from campus, apparel, and websites, the school has continued to identify and remove any leftover seals.
“As soon as the Corporation accepted the recommendation to retire the shield, the School undertook an effort to remove all known instances of it from campus locations, print materials, licensed products and web content that we had catalogued during a comprehensive inventory,” Gruber wrote. “Since then, we have infrequently come across instances of the shield and have promptly removed them.”
In the spring of 2016, the school replaced the Royall crests it had removed with a crimson seal with “Harvard Law” written in bold across the front. Throughout the bicentennial celebration over the past year, the school has used a special bicentennial logo.
Amanda M. Lee, former president of the Law School student government, wrote in an email Monday that the absence of an official seal has not generated much concern among the student body.
Lee did say, though, that some students “had concerns that the diploma might have a blank seal,” but those concerns quickly went away after Manning confirmed diplomas will bear the University’s “Veritas” seal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life will create a new group to “respond to the religious needs of students of diverse gender identities and sexual orientations,” Director of BGLTQ Student Life Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 wrote in an email sent to a Harvard BGLTQ list Saturday.
Scarborough tied the decision to create the new program to his office’s ongoing efforts to bring greater attention to “inclusive religious spaces,” according to the email.
“While Christianity has received much attention over the past semester, we know that questions about acceptance, community, and connection are alive for people of many religious traditions right now,” Scarborough wrote. “There are many ways, and many communities, in which to be queer and religious.”
Scarborough’s announcement comes a few months after the Office of Student Life announced it was placing Harvard College Faith and Action—the College’s largest Christian fellowship—on administrative probation for a year. The Crimson reported in Feb. 2018 that the move to place HFCA on probation was almost certainly tied to the organization’s decision to ask a woman in a same-sex relationship to step down from a leadership position last semester.
But the one-year probation will have little immediate practical effect on HCFA. The group has continued to use Yenching Auditorium—a Harvard-owned space—for its weekly worship event, Doxa. The Office of Student Life website asserts groups on “probation” for failing to complete their annual registration requirements are denied access to Harvard spaces.
Some College students launched an email campaign in early March calling on the OSL to impose more stringent punishments on HCFA.
Scarborough, in his email announcing the new group, specifically referenced past conversations with students about HCFA’s alleged discrimination and the College’s response.
“Many of you have expressed frustration at the lack of new information, and disappointment with explanations that have been slow, insufficient, or nonexistent,” Scarborough wrote. “These conversations have been painful for me as well, as a gay Christian with deep faith connections. And that pain is still alive in our community.”
Scarborough declined to give any specifics about the new group in an email sent to The Crimson Monday.
“At this time, it's far too early for me to answer your questions,” Scarborough wrote. “I plan to be in touch with students at a later date when there is more to share.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee—which doles out $300,000 in grants to students groups each year—said Monday they are optimistic that College changes to student funding will benefit their budget, despite a semester marked by financial instability.
According to committee chair Henry S. Atkins ’20, an increase in the total number of student groups at the College, as well as higher funding requests from some groups, combined to form a “structural tidal wave of forces” that placed the committee in a financially precarious position throughout the semester.
The committee was forced to make above-average cuts to its weekly grants pack on multiple occasions, with cuts in at least two weeks topping 30 percent. At one point, the problem was so pressing—with the committee preparing to impose a 43 percent across-the-board cut in one week in early March—that the Council tapped into its $18,000 Emergency Fund.
Nonetheless, committee leaders said they were relieved to have reached the end of the semester without being forced to make unusually large cuts in the semester’s final weeks.
“I think it took a lot of foresight to be able to get us where we were, a lot of planning on our policy, a lot of planning on our budget, as the weeks progressed, so that we wouldn’t be in a state of shock at the end of the semester,” said Swathi R. Srinivasan ’21, secretary of the Finance Committee.
Still, Atkins said he was disappointed the committee had to impose such large cuts to funding compared to cuts in past years.
“There were times as recently as a year ago, where we were thinking 20 percent was an astronomically high cut,” Atkins said. “So the fact that we kept things below, most weeks, under 30, 35, I’m happy with, but I still wish we could have done better.”
Committee leaders also said the College’s decision to increase the student activities fee by 150 percent this coming fall will provide an opportunity for the UC to obtain more money to fund student groups. Currently, the Council receives nearly all of the money gathered from the fee.
But starting fall 2018, the Office of Student Life plans to restructure the way it funds the Council, the College Events Board, House Committees, and the Intramural Sports Council, Alexander R. Miller, the College’s associate dean for student engagement, said in an interview earlier this month.
Specifically, the OSL plans to form a new committee—comprising both students and administrators—that will help distribute the funds. The committee will allocate funds in part based on student groups’ ability to engage with undergraduates, according to Miller.
Committee leaders called for the College to give part of the increased revenue gleaned from the fee to the Council. Ivy Yard Representative Seth D. Billiau ’21, who serves as vice chair of data of the finance committee, said current cuts are threatening the “financial stability” of student groups that don’t have other sources of funding.
“Right now, there are OSL-recognized clubs that are asking the UC for money for day-to-day operations, and we say that we can give them 75 percent of the money for that, which means that they have to go to their bases of members and ask for money,” Billiau said. “With that increase in the student activities fee, I would hope that the College would prioritize student-run and student-led social spaces, like OSL-recognized organizations.”
Committee leaders hesitated to assume their finances were now secure, though, saying the ideas they developed to improve the long-term stability of the budget should remain on the table.
“We’re not waiting for the cavalry to arrive because we need to proceed like we’re still going to have to deal with this situation,” Atkins said. “I suspect that whatever solution this body comes up with...is not going to fix all of our problems.”
Even though funding requests exceeded the UC’s budget this year, the shortfall was far less than in some previous years. In fall 2013, for example, student groups requested close to $400,000 in grants from the Council, while the Council ultimately allocated less than $145,000.
The finance committee considered multiple proposals this semester in an attempt to shore up its budget, including implementing a progressive cut on grants—which most likely would have disproportionately hurt larger student groups—but ultimately did not implement any significant structural changes.
“Once we get into the actual specifics of how that would work, it can become really contentious,” Atkins said of implementing a progressive cut. “Because that hurts some organizations more than others.”
The committee did, however, establish a minimum cut rate across weeks and began to more rigorously enforce its policy preventing groups in “bad standing”—or those who don’t return receipts or unused funds from previous committee grants—from receiving money from the UC.
Some committee members are considering other ideas to prevent large grant cuts in the future. For example, Billiau is proposing allocating slightly more money than available in the budget under the assumption that some groups will not claim the money, similar to the way airlines sell more tickets than available seats for some flights. Billiau cautioned, though, that the idea could be risky if too much money is allocated.
“In the first semester, I’m very comfortable doing that,” Billiau said. “In the second semester, I’m a little less comfortable doing that because if you run too big of a deficit, you may run into spending more money than you have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two popular female lecturers in the Kennedy School’s communications department, Marie A. Danziger and Alexandria Marzano-Lesnevich, will leave the school this semester.
Their departures comes amid increased scrutiny of the school’s faculty diversity, and a year after the departure of three prominent female administrators of color.
Danziger, who has been teaching at the Kennedy School for over 30 years, was part of developing one of the first credit-bearing communications courses at the school. The course, “Arts of Communication,” is still offered today and is one of the school’s most “well-known” classes, according to Amy J. Zhou, a second-year master in public policy student.
Danziger, who is retiring, said she had decided it was time for her “to figure out what to do with [her] life.”
She said she was taking a variety of University courses in subjects ranging from Italian to acting to artificial intelligence.
"Instead of performing and being the ‘professor teacher,’ I want to be a learner now,” Danziger said.
Marzano-Lesnevich, who has been at the school for five years as an adjunct lecturer, teaches two courses about policy-writing. She will be leaving the school to take a tenure-track position as an assistant professor in the English department at Bowdoin College.
Marzano-Lesnevich said she will be teaching creative nonfiction at Bowdoin but that she will be able to apply many of the same skills of writing narratives and stories that she taught to students at the Kennedy School.
“When we make a policy or think about a policy, we are in essence telling a narrative about the way the world is and the way the world should be,” Marzano-Lesnevich said. “And so that interrogation of narrative underlies everything I do at the Kennedy School, underlies everything I do in my own writing, and at Bowdoin. I'll be bringing out those same questions to the students, not so much around the policy but in other areas of life.”
Both lecturers were “really well-regarded, really terrific people,” according to Jeffrey L. Seglin, the director of the communications program at the Kennedy School.
Zhou, who took courses from both Danziger and Marzano-Lesnevich, said she enjoyed their courses and said both were “kind” to students.
Zhou brought up their departures at a meeting with the Kennedy School’s newly appointed diversity dean last week and expressed her concern with the lack of female faculty at the school.
A University-wide annual report about diversity showed that the Kennedy School has remained relatively stagnant in terms of number of female faculty over the past 10 years. In the report, HKS reported that 33 percent of tenure-track faculty are female, the same percentage as in 2008. In all, 21 percent of tenured faculty are female—up just one percentage point from 10 years prior.
The Kennedy School recently has been facing criticism of its faculty composition with many students and faculty calling on the school to recruit and retain more women and racial and ethnic minorities. Within the past year, three female administrators have stepped down from their position at the school, with one citing the “lack of support” she received from top leaders at the school.
Zhou said after not having a female professor throughout her first year at the school, it was a “priority” for her to “actively seek out” classes taught by female professors and lecturers. She said this disparity in female faculty puts women at a disadvantage when it comes to “networking” and building relationships with faculty members.
“The lack of diversity in the faculty really impacts the ability of minority students and women to get access to opportunities, particularly those which some white male professors might think of their favorite, white male students first,” Zhou said.
Seglin said the communications department, however, maintains an even gender balance among its faculty.
“There's people moving around; that happens every year because we have been growing the program, but it has always been in the communications program at least, it's been for the people who were teaching there about 50 percent women and 50 percent men,” Seglin said.
He said they have “already found” replacements for Danziger and Marzano-Lesnevich and the department will continue to have gender parity. Still, he said he understood concerns from students about their departures.
“I can understand students being upset when a good professor decides to retire,” Seglin said. “I think that’s a testament to how good the professor was, but people should be allowed to retire if they want to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department officers who forcibly arrested a black Harvard student April 13 “have yet to participate” in non-mandatory crisis intervention training meant to instruct officers how to manage situations involving mentally ill individuals, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
The 40-hour crisis training “supplements” the mandatory training officers receive every year, Warnick wrote in an email to The Crimson Monday.
The crisis intervention training is not required, according to the website of the Somerville Police Department, which also offers the training. CPD is one of roughly 20 local police departments that have committed to putting at least 10 percent of its officers through the training, per the site.
CPD aims to surpass that 10 percent threshold, though. “The goal is to train the entire department on this training,” the department's website states. Warnick wrote that CPD is “in the process” of making the training “available to the entire department.”
Roughly one-third of CPD’s officers and all supervisors have taken the training to date, Warnick wrote. The program is meant to help officers understand how to respond to situations involving individuals experiencing “mental illness,” according to the CPD website. As of last week, the arrested student remained in police custody in the hospital undergoing evaluation for issues including mental health concerns.
Three of the four CPD officers at the scene of the arrest—Steven C. Burke, Lucas Harney, and Casimir Maziarz—physically engaged with the undergraduate before arresting him. The fourth, Alexander Illyinski, was “covering the perimeter” and was not involved in the physical altercation, according to Warnick.
The arrest of the student has sparked allegations of police brutality from some eyewitnesses. A later CPD police report states the student—who was naked and likely under the influence of narcotics—clenched his fists and began making aggressive moves towards law enforcement, prompting the officers to tackle him.
But bystanders, including members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, have stated that CPD’s version of events is incorrect. BLSA members who saw the interaction have stated that the officers tackled the student “without provocation.”
A video of the incident later published by the New York Times shows the undergraduate standing still surrounded by four officers while the officers talk to him for at least several seconds. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an “ineffective” attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report. The student was ultimately arrested on charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, and assault.
It is currently unclear when or if the student will be arraigned; CPD Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said at a press conference last week that the arraignment has been delayed in part due to concerns about the undergraduate’s mental health.
CPD offers details about the crisis training on a section of their website labeled “Mental Health Outreach.”
“The 40-hour CIT training program offers technical assistance on effective strategies for best engaging with persons who have mental illness, diverting them from the criminal justice system and into treatment when that is a safe and appropriate option,” the website reads.
The department’s crisis intervention training is run in partnership with the Massachusetts chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Health, Warnick wrote.
The crisis training comes in addition to several mandatory annual programs for CPD officers. All department officers are required to attend in-service trainings, which include sessions about “Fair & Impartial Policing, Procedural Justice, Mental Health First Aid,  Management of Aggressive Behavior, Diffusing Aggressive Behavior, Law Enforcement Response to Mental Illness and Emotionally Disturbed People, among other sessions that assist officers in engaging with individuals who may be in crisis,” according to Warnick.
Thomas Nolan—professor of criminology and criminal justice at Merrimack College—said he commends CPD for their efforts to hold crisis intervention trainings for their officers.
“Crisis intervention training, as we see the necessity for in 2018, includes a recognition of the officers’ ability to see that someone is in distress and has some kind of mental disorder that needs some kind of special attention or a special response that is specific to the situation,” Nolan said.
“The value of the crisis intervention training is to be able to train officers to see this is a different kind of situation—this isn’t someone who is looking to do me harm—this is someone who is in significant mental distress, and I need to adopt different strategy to deal with this individual,” Nolan added.
Warnick wrote Monday that de-escalation forms a central theme across all trainings the department offers.
“The wide range of trainings we have made available to officers when dealing with people in crisis has also extended to special instruction from Strategies from Youth on ‘Policing the Teenage Brain’ and our newer officers receiving a 12-hour ‘Law Enforcement Response to Mental Illness and Emotionally Disturbed People’ class in the Police Academy,” Warnick wrote.
Warnick wrote that CPD has two “in-house Mental Health Outreach Officers” trained in First Aid and First Aid response for mental health. He wrote that both offer “insight and instruction” within the department as well as more broadly around the region.
Warnick also reaffirmed that CPD had jurisdiction to make the arrest, even though Harvard University Police Department has “primary jurisdiction over all crimes occurring on campus.”
The Crimson previously reported that CPD had jurisdiction because the student—who was arrested at the intersection of Massachusetts Ave. and Waterhouse St., feet from Harvard Law School’s campus—was not standing on campus and was thus outside the jurisdiction of  HUPD.
Nolan, a former officer in the Boston Police Department, said he does not think any type of additional training would have prevented the physical altercation April 13.
“I think that the cops, no matter what kind of training they had, were confronted with an individual who was being combative and aggressive and non-compliant, and I think they did what they needed to do,” Nolan said. “Certainly officers need to restrain their impulse; if it’s a situation where the officer lost his temper, that’s never appropriate.”
CPD is conducting an internal review in the wake of the arrest given the incident involved a use of force. CPD policy mandates the department must conduct this kind of review any time force is used.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 24, 2018 at 8:15 p.m.
The Cambridge City Manager released the city’s budget for fiscal year 2019 at a meeting Monday.
The city of Cambridge's budget for fiscal year 2019—released Monday—focuses on a wide range of issues facing Cambridge residents, including affordable housing and transportation improvements.
The city also plans to address problems facing early childhood development, education, and public safety. City Manager Louis A. DePasquale released the budget at a meeting of the City Council Monday.
“Cambridge is about helping people who need help, and I think if you look at this budget, it really exemplifies that,” DePasquale said at the meeting.
One of the budget’s main goals is to increase the range of housing available for residents regardless of socioeconomic status. Since 2002 and through the last fiscal year, Cambridge allocated more than $147 million towards affordable housing measures. This fiscal year, the city plans to increase funding by $650,000.
The city will also create a new executive position, the housing ombudsman, to help guide affordable housing initiatives.Though the exact details are still being determined, the job will entail bridging various city departments to address housing problems.
“One of the things we really want to do is to have someone who can really just try to help facilitate the challenges that people are facing,” DePasquale said. “They will work with us to really let us know what’s happening, where we need to go.”
The budget also specifies an additional $1.1 million for early childhood initiatives like the Birth to Third Grade Partnership—which strives to increase access to quality preschool education and was developed from the 2015 Early Childhood Task Force Report.
“The Task Force recognized that it would be a multi-year ongoing effort to build an effective early childhood system that would improve the outcomes for Cambridge’s children,” then-City Manager Richard C. Rossi said.
With the new fiscal year 2019 budget, the number of children that wouldn’t otherwise have the resources for preschool education is expected to double.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarification:
CORRECTION: April 24, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Cambridge allocated more than $147 million to affordable housing measures in fiscal year 2017. In fact, Cambridge allocated that amount toward affordable housing measures starting in 2002 and up through fiscal year 2017.
CLARIFICATION: April 24, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated the Cambridge City Council released the city's budget for fiscal year 2018. To clarify, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale released the budget at a meeting of the Council Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 24, 2018 at 5:25 a.m.
The Cambridge Police Department will add a new office to monitor use of force and racial bias in officers’ interaction with citizens, according to a proposed Cambridge budget for fiscal year 2019.
The addition comes in the wake of a confrontation between Cambridge Police and a black Harvard undergraduate on April 13 that has sparked allegations of police brutality and generated national headlines. City officials, though, said they had been considering procedural justice initiatives—which focus on police interactions with the public—prior to the incident.
Through the new office, which will be called the Office of Procedural Justice, CPD hopes to show a commitment to transparency and responsibility by analyzing citizens’ confrontations with the police, according to the proposed budget.
“Believed to be the first of its kind in the nation, the Office of Procedural Justice will focus on proactively monitoring data related to police-citizen interactions for indications of possible racial profiling, racially-biased policing, or use of force incidents,” the budget reads. “The Office will also assess the Department’s compliance with statutes, ordinances, and regulations aimed at mandating accountability.”
The procedural justice initiatives are an attempt to maintain officer accountability, according to Councillor Alanna M. Mallon. Mallon said city officials have particularly focused on procedural justice in light of the arrest of the undergraduate earlier this month.
“I know many of us are really thinking about this recently,” Mallon said. “But [procedural justice] has been something that has been in the works for a long time, and I look forward to really seeing that come to fruition.”
The arrest of the undergraduate—who was naked and likely under the influence of narcotics—at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse Street April 13 has roiled campus. CPD officers involved tackled the undergraduate to the ground before arresting him, a move a later CPD police report asserts was necessary because the student had clenched his fists and made aggressive moves toward law enforcement. But eyewitnesses have called CPD's version of events "incorrect" and have stated the officers acted "without provocation."
A video of the incident later published by the New York Times shows the student standing still surrounded by four officers while the officers talk to him briefly. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an “ineffective” attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report. The student was ultimately arrested on charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, and assault.
CPD Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said at a press conference last week that the student’s arraignment has been delayed in part due to concerns about the undergraduate’s mental health.
In the weeks following the arrest, Harvard students formed a new activist group meant to hold Harvard accountable for its students' safety—particularly the safety of "Black and Brown students," according to the group's mission statement. The organization, dubbed Black Students Organizing for Change, held a protest against police brutality Saturday.
CPD also will create a new Family and Social Justice Section in the coming fiscal year to better serve “the city’s most vulnerable populations,” according to the proposed budget. These populations include children, senior citizens, and those afflicted by homelessness, mental illness, substance abuse, domestic violence, or sexual assault.
“The new section will bring together various units that individually work to provide services that divert individuals away from the criminal justice system and toward the support services they need, reinforcing the human dimension of social justice,” the budget reads.
As a part of the department reorganization, CPD will also add six new positions comprising “one Deputy Superintendent, one child psychologist, one licensed social worker, and three additional patrol officers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Lezley McSpadden—the mother of slain black teenager Michael Brown—declared her interest in running for Ferguson City Council at an Institute of Politics panel Monday evening.
McSpadden spoke alongside attorneys Benjamin Crump and Jasmine Rand, as well as documentary filmmaker Jason Pollock, for nearly two hours
Crump prompted McSpadden to talk about her political interests during the panel event: “Please talk about what you're contemplating.”
“What I'm contemplating is running for city council,” McSpadden responded, eliciting overwhelming applause from the packed audience.
Several minutes later, McSpadden said that a run for office would constitute part of her broader advocacy efforts after the 2014 shooting of her son. Brown was 18 when he was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
“We're pushing forward and we're coming through,” McSpadden said. “We have to get behind people that look like us and into elected seats so that they can really do what's right in our community. I'm going to start with me when I run for city council.”
“We're seeing new people being elected, but will it change what happened then? No. But we can change the course of what may happen tomorrow and what is happening now,” McSpadden added.
Pollack wrote to The Crimson after the event that McSpadden is considering the run “very seriously” and has spoken about it “publicly.”
A screening of Pollack’s documentary on Brown’s death, “Stranger Fruit,” preceded the panel. Pollock recounted hearing news of the 2014 shooting and said he moved to Ferguson immediately after to research the event.
“I didn’t want to go there with a Christopher Columbus-type attitude,” Pollock said.
Both Pollock and Crump commented on the media’s portrayal of Brown, saying they took issue with his description as a “thug.”
“Just imagine if it was your child, and then not only the death of the child, but the cover up of the character, which I think is the thing that is so unhuman about this and so different,” Pollock said.
“It's the same thing every time. First they assassinate you, then they assassinate your character,” Crump said.
Crump also pointed to what he identified as the differential treatment of minorities by law enforcement.
“We certainly can't forget about Dylann Roof, the young white supremacist who went and killed nine of the most innocent people you could ever find in a church in South Carolina,” Crump said. “Then the police not only take him alive, but they take him to Burger King to get a burger and fries. Where is the humanity for Michael Brown? For Stephon Clark? For Alton Sterling? For Philando Castile?”
“Young white men who have already murdered people get more consideration than a young unarmed black man in America,” Crump stated.
Jasmine Rand, another attorney who represented the Brown family, said that lawyers are often limited in the advocacy they can provide.
“That's why Jason needs to tell this story through the film. And that's why Lezley needs to keep telling it. We all have to work together in as many mediums as we can to create social change,” Rand said. “ We can write the most beautiful laws in the world... but that's not enough because we have inequitable minds sitting on benches and inequitable minds sitting in jurors boxes and they're going to continue making inequitable resolutions. Being a lawyer is not enough.”
Pollock concluded the panel event with an entreaty to audience members to become involved.
“In terms of the movement, please connect with us. We're going to be here. I think that today can be a historic day in reopening the case,” Pollock said. “We will look back at this day to the people in this room and remember that it started here at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you know you have a good team, just put your head down and go to work. The Bad Boys, out of Cambridge, Mass., know it best.
The Harvard baseball team took two of three from the visiting Brown squad last weekend, evening out its Ivy League record at 6-6 to stay alive in the hunt for the top Ancient Eight spots. The Crimson (16-17, 6-6 Ivy League) took the first two games, 3-1 and 8-7, on Saturday afternoon, before falling, 7-3, on Sunday.
The new Ivy League divisional format, unveiled this year, will pit the top two teams at the season’s end against each other in a mid-May championship series.
With just three conference series left in 2018, Harvard currently sits fifth in the standings, a game and a half out of second.
Unlike the Crimson teams of years past, the 2017-18 squad has legitimate reason to strive for more than just fifth place, as a 2018 Beanpot title and several wins over strong teams provide ample justification for placing Harvard towards the top of the Ivy table.
The team still sits in the middle of the pack, though. Series wins are a good place to start.
Senior pitcher Noah Zavolas, a week after throwing a no-hitter and garnering NCAA Player of the Week honors, tossed another gem on the mound to lead the way for the Crimson, while junior designated hitter P.J. Robinson had a good weekend at the plate, hitting 6-for-9 in the series with two RBIs, two walks, and two runs scored.
Yale looks to be sitting comfortably at the top of the table at 11-4 in Ivy play, while Columbia holds on to the golden-ticket second spot with a 9-6 record.
“We’re not at a terrible spot right now,” said junior first baseman Pat McColl. “We’d like to be a little better off than we are—I think we let a couple [games] slip through that we think we should’ve had. But if we can do all we can, win our games, we’ll see how it turns out and not worry about anything else.”
Harvard’s upcoming midweek tilt against a good Princeton team (10-17, 7-5) is a pivotal series. A sweep over the Tigers could hypothetically leapfrog the Crimson up unto a tie for the second-place spot in the standings, while a poor showing could seriously damage Harvard’s championship aspirations.
Brown (8-22, 4-11) sits last in the conference.
BROWN 7, HARVARD 3
Going for the sweep at O’Donnell Field on a warm Sunday afternoon, Harvard couldn’t get late rally-starting hits to land in the right places, losing 7-3 after the Bears scored thrice in the fifth and twice in the seventh to pull away.
Establishing itself early in a series has never been the Crimson’s problem this season. In fact, against its four Ivy League opponents so far, Harvard has won the series-opener every time—some in defiant fashion, including no-hitting league leaders Yale and exploding for 11 runs on second-place Columbia.
The problem has been running out of steam and sometimes letting the series get away.
The Crimson has lost all four Ivy League series-cappers so far, a trend that Harvard will look to remedy as crunch time nears. The Crimson also lost both series to the Bulldogs and Lions despite the dominant showing out of the gates.
Down 6-0 on Sunday, Harvard still put up a fight against Brown, scoring twice in the seventh on hits by senior second baseman Matt Rothenberg, McColl, and Robinson. The Crimson had runners on second and third in the eighth and got a McColl homer in the ninth, but could only a muster a trade of tallies as it fell by four runs.
“You do all you can at those times in the game,” said McColl, who has a team-leading 32 RBIs on the season. “I think we put pretty good swings on the ball, it’s just that sometimes they fall, and sometimes they don’t—Ben [Skinner] hit one hard that just didn’t get through.”
Junior pitcher Kevin Stone got the start on the bump and pitched six innings, giving up three earned runs and striking out a trio of Brown batsmen. The loss gave the workhorse righty a 3-3 record and a 7.24 ERA in an up-and-down season, well above his career 5.53 ERA.
McColl led the way for the Harvard offense, hitting 2-for-5 with two RBIs and two runs scored. Robinson went 3-for-3 with an RBI single in the seventh.
Bears senior outfielder Sam Grigo did the most damage, driving in four runs on a three-run bomb in the fifth and a late sac fly to tack on an insurance tally.
HARVARD 8, BROWN 7
In the Saturday nightcap game, the Crimson offense spread the wealth around in a true team effort, as the squad scattered 15 hits up and down the lineup and got the leadoff man aboard in five of its nine innings to keep the pressure on Brown.
Harvard surely needed every bit of its offensive production to take down the visitors, 8-7, despite the Bears’ late rally to knot the game at seven.
The Crimson made sure to send the Harvard fans home happy on a Rothenberg walk-off single with one out in the bottom of the ninth to score junior pinch-runner Trent Bryan from third.
“It’s always tough, but we bounce back really well as a team,” said junior righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson, who got the start and the no-decision. “I think a big difference between these guys, this year, and years past that I’ve been here, is that we do a good job of bouncing back, competing when it matters.”
After Brown put together two runs the frame prior, sophomore third baseman Hunter Bigge kickstarted the home half of the ninth with a leadoff single.
Freshman shortstop Buddy Mrowka followed through with the fundamentals, laying down a sac bunt to move the pinch-runner over.
Skinner, sporting a .400 on-base percentage this season, a .308 batting average, and a team-leading 12 stolen bases in the leadoff spot, continued to spearhead the Crimson attack, going 2-for-5 and scoring twice.
Spots three through seven in the order followed Skinner by all notching at least one hit. Seven different Harvard hitters posted an RBI. Robinson, Bigge, Mrowka, and Rothenberg all had multi-hit games.
Rosenblum-Larson struck out six in five innings of work, giving up just two earned runs and four hits to lower his season ERA to 3.21. The junior, while being the team’s strikeout leader with 10.57 K/9, also walked five batters on Saturday.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
Zavolas is a man who can’t be touched right now.
The senior righty has a 24.0-inning—yes, twenty-four—scoreless streak going on right now, as he has rendered the Penn, Yale, and now Brown offenses useless in his last three outings of 7.0, 9.0, and 8.0 innings, respectively.
Shades of the dominance of last week’s no-hitter at Yale returned to O’Donnell Field, as Zavolas, now 5-1 as a starter, posted a final line of 8.0 IP, four hits, no runs, no walks, and 11 punchouts. The Acton, Mass., native threw 75 of his 101 pitches for strikes.
“Noah puts in the work every day,” said Rosenblum-Larson of his fellow starter. “He’s an unbelievably hard worker, who knows how to pitch, who knows how to focus, and I’m just happy he’s having success.”
Three early runs were all the support that the Crimson pitching staff needed, as McColl’s third-inning RBI single and Mrowka’s two-RBI knock in the fourth stood the test of time.
Mrowka has heated up recently, as the rookie now leads the team with a .326 BA after his 5-for-12 weekend. The Duxbury, Mass., native has also driven in 12 runs on the season.
Sophomore righty Kieran Shaw got the save to close out the game, giving up just a solo shot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pale skies and warm weather greeted Harvard football back to the Colosseum for its annual Spring Game on Saturday. Amongst the various other Visitas events, the Crimson’s return to the turf featured a sprinkling of lanyard-wearing prefrosh, mostly recruited football players, throughout the stands and on the sidelines.
While the prospective students experienced the scrimmage, they couldn’t possibly understand the match’s context.
In its last match five months ago, Harvard fell handedly to Yale, 24-3 in the wet mud-field that was the Yale Bowl. Though playing Saturday in better weather, the tension was still there, the air thick with anticipation for this year’s season and heavy with the recent loss.
Though Spring Games at other schools feature the first team offense battling the second team defense and vise versa, the Crimson does differently. Hardly an even game, both offenses don crimson while the defenses wear white, making the only possible way for the defense to score a turnover for a touchdown.
In this year’s rendition, the Crimson squad blanked the White, 40-0, in the two-quarter scrimmage.
Though some players didn’t play, and lineups and strategies will change before action officially gets underway in the fall, the Spring Game offered an early look at a Harvard squad in transition. A small sample to satiate the appetite anticipating fans until September 15.
BATTLE FOR THE BACKFIELD
During last year’s preseason, it was absolutely certain that senior quarterback Joe Viviano was the clear starter in the position for the team, until it wasn’t.
The veteran and 2016 starter took first snaps in the Crimson’s opening loss to a URI team it had never been beaten by, snapping a 13-game win streak in the opening month. When Harvard lined up again the following week against Brown, it wasn’t Viviano, but rather freshman Jake Smith under center.
The start represented the first time that Crimson coach Tim Murphy had trusted a freshman to take first snaps under center since the coach handed the offensive reigns to Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick 16 years prior. The rookie stepped up to the plate, delivering on only his second collegiate drive. Just over three minutes in, Smith marched the squad down the field for Harvard’s first offensive touchdown of the season.
The score and Smith’s command of the offense in that Brown game enthralled the crowd, but his success tapered off as the match progressed. In the second quarter, Murphy sent Viviano back in. The senior played as if his job depended on it, because it did. In his first drive since losing the starting job, Viviano took over on the Crimson’s own two-yard line. The veteran threw and completed five passes for 76 yards. Junior running back Charlie Booker III barreled the points in from five yards out to cap off the drive.
And so, a year’s worth of quarterback drama ensued. No one could ever guess which of the two gunslingers would take the field first nor how long they would stay. In play that epitomized the season’s quarterback competition, Smith started against Yale and was replaced by Viviano in the final stanza.
As the team returns to the field, it seems another battle for the starting spot is all lined up. In Saturday’s scrimmage, it was Smith who stepped on as the first offense quarterback, followed by junior Tom Stewart—the quarterback Smith passed for the starting spot after the URI game—for the second offense.
“Jake [Smith] ended up being the number one guy for a good part of the [2017] season,” said Murphy of his quarterback decision. “There wasn’t a lot of difference between Jake, Joe or Tommy, but that’s the way it is sometimes.”
Stewart was sure to convey a difference on Saturday. The junior converted on seven of his 11 passing attempts for 118 yards and added two touchdowns to his state sheet. When he was forced to escape the pocket, Stewart found positive yardage, netting 54 yards on his feet.
Smith hit his only touchdown of the evening on his first drive, finding freshman tight end Adam West. The freshman hit four of 11 attempts for 56 yards.
However, Stewart’s been away from the field for a while. In the junior’s last start—a 27-17 loss to Holy Cross in 2016—he racked up a touchdown, an interception, and three fumbles.
“It’s a really good competition and the bottom line is, we’re deeper and better at the quarterback position and that obviously bodes well for our football team,” Murphy said. “It continues to be a competition, but really I feel good about both guys. They have a long way to go, but I feel good about both guys.”
SORRY FOR CHARLIE ROCKING
If you give a mouse a cookie he’ll ask for a glass of milk, but if you give Booker the ball he’ll get you a first down—no questions asked.
Booker seems on track to continue to replicate and build on his powerful, steady presence that  he brought to the field in the 2017 season. When all things failed, the one thing Harvard could consistently count on was Booker getting a few yards.
Though injured prior to the 2017 Yale game, the junior made sure there were no doubts about his ability to run the ball in this—his return to full contact play.
To open the game, the Crimson went first to the air, with Smith threading a pass behind the receiver across the middle, the ball dropping to the turf. On the second play, Murphy went to his bread-and-butter, handing Booker the ball and pointing him right. Number 21 broke the give for 55 yards. The offense scored on the next play.
Despite being in a three-way rotation with sophomore Lavance Northington and freshman Aaron Shampklin for the duration of the 2017 season, Booker still earned First-team All-Ivy honors coupled with the division’s third highest net yardage. Under the lights on Saturday, Booker ran six times and tabbed 93 yards.
“It takes so much off my back to be able to have running backs like them,” Smith said. “I really don’t have to do anything when those guys are behind me. I just hand them the ball and they take it for 40 yards. Really that’s all I could ask for.”
While neither Northington nor Shampklin played in the Spring Game, Booker rotated with freshmen BJ Watson and Devin Darrington. Both Maryland natives, the former averaged 8.3 yards per carry on nine attempts for 75 yards. Darrington barreled into the defensive line 13 times for 59 yards. Both freshmen added touchdowns to the Crimson point total.
“Those guys are hardworking, they challenge me everyday,” Booker said. “It’s great competition and it’s just great to see guys like that because they’re just going to take it over when it’s their time.”
SENIOR SKIP DAY
Looking to the skill positions on the roster, there looks to be an oversampling of young players in starting slots for Harvard. With Smith vying again for the quarterback spot, two freshman backs, freshman West excelling at tight end, four freshman corners getting healthy playing time, and only one senior listed at the linebacker, the skill players are a young group.
“I really truly believe we’ll be a better defense next year than we were a year ago,” Murphy said. “I think part of that is we’re going to have a veteran defensive front that hopefully can be two deep….I think the key will be how quickly the linebacking corps will come along because we’ve been banged up at the position. And also the secondary, we have a relatively young secondary.”
Losing the seniors may hurt the most for the linebackers. Though the group lost many to injury throughout the 2017 season, the corps entirely consisted of seniors, seniors from Texas. To succeed, the defense must fill the holes left by the graduation of players like 2017-captain Luke Hutton and Chase Guillory. The youth showed on Saturday night as the offenses dropped 40 points. Last season, the first defense held the first offense scoreless across the match.
“We didn’t play great,” sophomore linebacker Joey Goodman said. “We’re really low on the defense right now. We have some injuries, some guys getting hurt, some guys coming back in the fall, so it was tough for us. We were just rotating through a lot. Obviously we were getting tired, but we didn’t play good enough on our end. We’ve just got to get better.”
In the trenches, however, age and experience are plentiful. Suiting up for the grudge match were six junior offensive lineman and four on the defensive front.
“If you look at our first offense, it’s going to be a heavily dominated senior offensive line,” Murphy said. “Really, I think the strength of the team will be in our offensive and defensive line. Our offensive line and ability to run the football is thing I think we’ve improved the most at.”
AIN’T NO REST FOR THE WEARY
The Spring Game represents not the beginning of preparation for the new season, but the end of winter workouts, a multi-month grind beginning on January 22 and culminating in the friendly intrasquad competition.
“We’re waking up early basically every day from the day we get here for the second semester,” Booker said. “[The Spring Game] is a good time to finally just get back on the field. You get pretty antsy just working out all the time, and you want to see what you’re producing. So it’s a great time to finally see what you’ve produced.”
Now, the team will have a small break to breathe, study for exams, and see their families before summer workouts begin anew in June.
“These kids have been up at six o’clock in the morning for basically the last three months, training hard in the weight room for the last month, out here at o’dark thirty practicing and working hard,” Murphy said. “They’ve given us great energy…. They’ll get a little bit of a rest from the coaches and get a chance to relax a little, decompress a little. Then come June 1, we’re back with summer training, getting ready for the season.”

We respect the “kind initiation” rituals of the Oak Club, which forced new members to carry around cumbersome planks of oak at all times. Here are some ideas for other final clubs, inspired by The Oak’s precedent of taking mascot dedication extremely literally.
The Bee: Carry a beehive
A great way to prove your dedication to this final club would be to carry around a beehive all week. You may get stung along the way,  but it’s definitely worth it for the lifelong friends who love you for your personality. (Although, this mascot could also apply to the X—see below—which apparently seeks to promote Bumble.) Uh huh, honey.
The Phoenix: Light yourself on fire
You’ll fit right into the club if you light a small part of yourself on fire and keep it ablaze until the end of the week. Only a true Phoenix will be reborn from the ashes. Bonus points to the member who gets the fewest burns throughout the week.
The X: Get handcuffed to your ex
The way to show loyalty to The X? Get handcuffed to your ex (preferably with their permission). While handcuffing may have been an exhilarating part of your past relationship, this sort may be the thing that breaks the final few new members who weren’t up to snuff. Alternatively, exist, because that's ostensibly what the Exister Society does (but that's not so difficult).
The Spee: Hire a bear to chase you
The Spee has the potential to create a truly remarkable test for those sophomores wishing to join their ranks. What could be a more challenging than trying to outrun a grizzly  bear to gain entry to the exclusive social club? Plus, there’s no better way to show off your connections than to call in your own personal bear on short notice.
As for the clubs we didn’t mention: get creative. The opportunities for wholesome initiation fun are endless.
