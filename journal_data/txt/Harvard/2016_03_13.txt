After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Furo Wariboko, still living in his parents’ home at 33 years of age, wakes up on the morning of yet another hopeless job interview to find that he has become a white man. And thus, in a wry, bold play on Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” Nigerian author A. Igoni Barrett launches his readers into the story of one lost man’s journey through the roiling streets and turbulent politics of Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, while embarking on an investigation of both the transformation of an identity as well as the social implications of race. Barrett stakes out a daring plot of ground for “Blackass” to cover—and though the novel is neither narratively perfect nor a mind-blowing opus of revolutionary social commentary, it delivers a thoughtful and insightful snapshot of Lagos, race, and people that is ultimately satisfying to read.
Race is obviously inescapable given the novel’s premise, and there is always the implicit potential for race-related commentary to go awry when the author is of one race (Barrett is a black Nigerian) and the subject at hand another (Furo, though originally a black Nigerian, spends the novel as a white man). However, Barrett successfully executes nuanced thinking about race. Though Furo is in a place of power as a white person, Barrett also shows us the underbelly of his psychology, which most readers might not expect, or think to demand: his alienation and his sense of otherness. Furo continuously reaps the benefits one might expect a white man in Africa to receive—unsolicited help, job offerings, material gifts, respect. When Furo contemplates whether or not to tell his parents about his transformation, Barrett writes, “(Question: Would Furo’s family have accepted him for what he’d become? Answer: No white man has ever been lynched in Lagos.)” He is, ostensibly, superhuman. On the other hand, however, Furo spends much of the novel being ogled on the street, called oyibo (white person), patronizingly praised for his flawless Nigerian accent, brashly approached and solicited by strangers and prostitutes, exploited by businessmen, and feeling deeply insecure about being in public.
Barrett’s social scrutiny also moves beyond the novel’s overt premise of black-and-white race relations, adeptly unpacking the more universal, flawed, and hilarious state of being a human being. Much of this analysis is woven throughout the book in choice moments of action and eagle-eyed single observations. Furo’s sister visits the mortuary with her parents to look for Furo’s corpse, tweets about the appalling condition of the mortuary, and makes the hashtag “mortuary” trend in Lagos. “Thanks ALL!!! My phone battery’s about to die have to go now. #mortuary,” she tweets triumphantly, wonderfully exemplifying the ruthlessly click-absorbed mentality of social media. A stranger on the street asks Furo if he’s from Poland; Furo says he isn’t, and the man goes ahead and waxes on about his personal dream of moving to Poland. Furo’s skin color serves not only as a source of racial insight, but brings out the idiosyncratic and the laughable in human behavior.
Barrett is in part able to achieve this balancing act between social commentary and engaging storyline—critique and playfulness—through the versatility and quickness of his language. The pacing feels pleasantly casual and syncopated upon first read; Barrett’s voice often sounds like that of a friend telling stories over Saturday night’s round of drinks, though upon close scrutiny the diction is precise and original. He jests of an apartment: “Everything spoke of new money and no eye for colour coordination”; just one page later, he describes the dimples on its owner’s back as “a creator’s finger marks.” In many sequences of physical action and descriptions of setting, however, this voice becomes straightforward and cinematic, panning across rooms and zooming into people as they speak in a manner reminiscent of movie camerawork. The pace slows markedly some of these sections, which feels a bit at odds with the tightness and poetry of Barrett’s language elsewhere. Overall, however, the effect is engaging, endearing, and effective, rhythmically rolling the reader along from page to page, scene to scene.
Barrett’s rendering of Lagos stands out amidst all these laudable aspects of “Blackass.” Synthesizing his observational and linguistic skills, Barrett shows his readers the city in all its physicality, language, and social nuances. He delivers dialogue in unapologetic pidgin, written with absolutely no auxiliary explanation of what’s being said. He includes a chapter narrated in long strings of tweets. At times, he takes the liberty of pausing the forward momentum of the plot to expound upon a particular situation—Lagos’ youth joblessness problem and floundering education system, the dearth of Nigerian literature, the appalling and unregulated traffic, the dirtiness—or to create a vivid sensual sketch. In one instance, a paragraph’s single sustaining plot point is Furo arriving at a bus stop, after which Barrett writes: “In this roadside market stood food sellers with huge pots of steaming food, fish sellers with open basins of live catfish and dead crayfish, hawkers with wooden trays of factory-line snacks, iceboxes of mineral sodas and armloads of pirated music CDs… Then there was the noise, the raw sound of money, of haggling and wheedling and haranguing, the rise and rise of voices against the roar of traffic.” This description is not particularly, immediately pertinent to Furo’s situation at the moment, nor does Barrett ever really return him to such a market setting where this previous description might resurface in a reader’s memory. But by the time the novel concludes, all of Barrett’s investment in writing Lagos pay off, leaving a grand, compelling sensory and social impression.
In terms of social parable, “Blackass” builds well upon the foundation of Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” placing its meditations on identity and society in a vibrant, contemporary setting and reconfiguring it into terms of the omnipresent and ever-pressing questions of race. Barrett’s unique, well-controlled voice offers easy access to the teeming interior life of his protagonist and the bustling streets of his city—and his genuine sympathy for and appreciation of both hold the reader there to the end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team welcomed the Holy Names Hawks from Oakland, California to the Malkin Athletic Center for the first ever meeting on Friday evening. Despite comfortable wins in the first two sets, a nail-biter third set was necessary for Harvard to take down the Hawks, 3-0.
With the third game tied at 24-24, the Crimson (9-6, EIVA 5-2) kept spectators on their toes as Harvard fought to keep the match against Holy Names (1-16) from going into a fourth set.
“They started putting pressure on us and they started serving well,” Baise said. “They started defending well and getting some good digs.”
A 4-0 run for Holy Names set the stage for the Hawks to take their first large lead of the match at 13-10.
“The third set was definitely tough we stopped passing well,” sophomore Riley Moore said.  “But I think we fought especially once we went down after 20 it’s hard to come back.”
For the remainder of the set, Holy Names and the Crimson battled it out point for point with neither team ever getting more than a two point lead.
Volleyball rules require teams to win by at least two-points —but Holy Names and Harvard were still tied at 25-25.
“Especially after 20 it’s really tough to come back,” Moore said. “[During the time out] we talked about staying focused and playing like the first set.”
Finally, after 10 ties and six lead changes, with players fighting point for point and diving for saves, sophomore outside hitters Brad Gretsch and Jack Heavey made two kills in a row, to finish the match and give Harvard a 3-0 win for the second game in a row.
“Brad Gretsch had a really great match,” Baise said after Gretsch recorded a career-high of five service aces and contributed 11 kills for Harvard.
Carrying over the momentum from the Crimson’s last match, a 3-0 thrashing against EIVA rival Sacred Heart, Harvard dominated early and often through the first two sets. Three kills by Moore kicked things off for the Crimson, tallying three kills to give his team an early 7-3 lead in the first set.
Harvard went on to win the first set 25-12, with captain Branden Clemens leading the team with 5 kills and Gretsch recording three aces. The Crimson finished the game with 9 consecutive points, out-hitting Holy Names .435 to .000. Overall, Clemens had 14 kills on the night, his 14th double-digit total of the season.
“In the first game we were passing really well, so Marko [Kostich] was able to run the whole offense,” Moore said. “Once the passing goes it’s really predictable where we’re setting so it makes it a lot easier for the other team.”
In the second set, the Hawks began challenging Harvard. Holy Names came out to an early 3-1 lead, which the Crimson quickly closed; however, the score remained close for a significant portion of the game.
A streak of service aces for Harvard enabled the Crimson to build a substantial lead with the score jumping from 8-7 to 9-15 within minutes.
Holy Names staged a late game comeback, but their efforts were not enough to ever overtake Harvard. The frame ended with freshman middle blocker Trevor Dow clinching the match with a kill.
“Trevor Dow has been in there now almost the whole season,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “And he gets better with every practice, every game.”
Dow, a local freshman from Needham, Massachusetts was recently named EIVA Defensive Player of the Week on Feb. 29 and the Off the Block/Springbak, Inc. National Freshman of the Week honorable mention on Feb. 22, Feb. 29, and March 7.
The Crimson now prepares to play another non-conference match; this time against ranked opponent Cal Baptist on Monday.
“They are a really good team from a really good conference,” Moore said. “Passing and defense will be most important for us”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s hockey team, the long and winding road to Lake Placid ended in atypical fashion Saturday night: wide and straight.
On the strength of a season-high eight goals, the No. 12/12 Crimson unceremoniously dismissed Rensselaer in Game 2 of the ECAC tournament quarterfinals at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, 8-2, clinching a spot in the conference’s final four in the process.
After yielding a 2-1 lead to the Engineers (18-15-7, 8-7-7 ECAC) late in the first period, the Crimson (18-9-4, 12-6-4) scored seven unanswered goals, including two from co-captain Jimmy Vesey. Harvard goaltender Merrick Madsen recorded 37 saves, one shy of his career high. A year removed from its 2015 tournament triumph in Lake Placid, the Crimson will return to the 1980 Herb Brooks Arena next weekend with a shot at a title defense.
So far, that defense has not been easy. Saturday’s final score belied a gritty series that featured standout play in one net and bad luck in the other.
For Harvard, Madsen produced a series of acrobatic and disciplined stops while the game was still in doubt, frustrating the visitors in their final push to extend their season.
“I thought Merrick Madsen was unbelievable,” RPI coach Seth Appert said. “He was the difference tonight. As crazy as that sounds in a game like that, that game could have easily been 4-4, 5-4 us after two periods.”
Meanwhile, the Engineers’ chances to extend their season took a hit before the opening draw, as Appert opted to start freshman goaltender Cam Hackett in place of senior star Jason Kasdorf. Appert revealed following the game that Kasdorf had sustained a groin injury in a Friday morning skate prior to the first game of the series.
Although Hackett had proved to be a serviceable starter in Kasdorf’s absence earlier in the season, the freshman struggled Saturday, yielding the game’s first goal on an unlikely close-angle attempt by Harvard sophomore Jake Horton at 15:02 in the first period. Defensemen Clay Anderson and Brayden Jaw also beat Hackett with outside shots for their third and second goals of the season, respectively.
Appert considered Saturday an unsavory end to a series that seemed to be within his team’s grasp, despite the final goal-differential.
“I thought we played our rear ends off,” Appert said. “I thought we were really good. I thought we carried the play and I thought we had the better scoring chances. I thought we were great…. It’s just a tough situation for [Hackett] to walk into.”
Playing in his final game at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, Vesey highlighted a four-goal third period with two unassisted strikes.
The Hobey Baker hopeful scored an innocent-looking shot from the left faceoff dot just 15 seconds into the final frame to extend Harvard’s lead to 5-2. Thirteen minutes later, he created a breakaway off a turnover in the neutral zone before finishing five-hole.
The goals move Vesey into sole possession of fifth-place on Harvard’s all time goal-scoring list at 79.
“I think it was a fitting way to go out,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It was a fitting way for the people here in attendance to see one of the great Harvard players play his last home game here.”
RPI’s only lead of the series lasted less than 60 seconds in the midst of a goal-scoring blitz late in the first period.
Just over a minute after Horton’s goal, junior Riley Bourbonnais provided a controversial tying mark after the Engineers gained a step on the Crimson with a quick line change. The goal stood following an official review for too many men on the ice, allowing the visitors to take the lead 23 seconds later with a goal from freshman Jesper Ohrvall.
The one-two punch did little to knock the Crimson off balance.
Vesey found freshman defenseman Viktor Dombrovskiy with a feed up the slot to even the score at 17:43 in the period. Out of the break, Sean Malone beat Hackett glove-side off a drop pass from Jaw at 1:35 in the second period, and Anderson provided the first insurance marker with a quick wrist shot from the right faceoff dot at 9:26.

The two-goal lead held into the third after officials waved off a potential Engineers strike in the second period. Following Vesey’s goals, Jaw converted a slapshot on a power play with under four minutes to play, and freshman Ryan Donato finished on a two-on-one with classmate Michael Floodstrand a minute later.
With the sweep, the Crimson will arrive in Lake Placid with its NCAA tournament hopes relatively unscathed, although sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman left Saturday’s game early with an upper body injury. Currently sitting 11th in the Pairwise rankings, Harvard will face St. Lawrence or Cornell in single-elimination play Friday, pending the result of the Quinnipiac-Cornell series, which concludes Sunday.

In an emotional sense, Harvard can be an isolating place. But when you have mumps, it is the literal definition of an isolating place. Specifically, Harvard has become a place that isolates its students so much that it quarantines them in uninhabited Inns, and neglects to inform existing residents. So for those who either feel overwhelmed by the metaphorical isolation of their lives or by the literal quarantine of their mumps-infected room, Flyby has some tips on how to live in isolation:
Keeping Yourself Entertained
There are a couple straightforward options here. First, you can live vicariously through others by constantly updating your Snapchat feed and hoping that Harvard will get a mumps-specific filter. Adding celebrities on Snapchat is a new trend, and odds that they have mumps are low. Then, you can check your Instagram and Facebook. Eventually, face-timing friends in hopes that someone will care enough to answer is a good option, and you can check out Flyby’s special coverage on dating apps (let’s hope rumors haven’t spread of your viral infection), because clearly this attempt to find love (looking at you, PSK) didn’t end well.
Eating Regular Meals
For this section, instead of writing our own potential options, we’re just going to copy and paste the email sent to students with mumps itself. No, this is not a joke. This is the actual email received by students with mumps who have been isolated at the Inn:
You can use the HUDS website to see what is being offered, and then email your dining hall manager -- James Carr,james_carr@harvard.edu -- and the House deliverer about 45 minutes before you would like to eat. In fact, if you would like, you could place your order for all three meals at once, and just indicate pick up times for each meal. You can order hot or cold food, and HUDS will have it ready for the deliverer to pick it up. Once the meal has been picked up at the dining hall, the deliverer should call the student to let them know the food is on the way. The student should remain in their room with the door closed.
When the food is delivered, it will be placed by the deliverer on the floor in front of the student’s room, in the hallway. The deliverer will knock on the door. The deliverer will move away from the door and leave the area. The student should wait a minute or two after the knock for the deliverer to move away from the door. Then, the student may open the door and retrieve the food, closing the door behind them.
You read that correctly; no human contact for those infected with the big bad mumps, even at meal time. If that message isn’t isolating, I don’t know what is.
Make Sure People Care
Posting on Facebook might not be the best option if you don’t want people to avoid you for unnecessary reasons once you’ve recovered, but garnering pity through various GroupMes and spending your time making sure the blocking group iMessage chat explodes every time your friends get out of class can be a meaningful and fulfilling way to pass your newly acquired never-ending free time. Because the other people also in quarantine likely have mumps, consider passing them messages through the doors asking if they would like to Netflix and chill.
If all else fails, do not fear: your literal isolation only lasts about two weeks, so the end is always in sight. For all those who are currently unscathed, keep calm and enjoy your freedom. You never know when a little case of the mumps could turn you too into a victim of isolation.
