After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christopher J. Hossfeld ’02 is a composer and conductor whose music has been performed at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., as well as at both Yale and Harvard. Having previously worked as artistic director at Opera da Camera and One Equall Musick in Montreal, Hossfeld has recently moved back to Massachusetts.
The Harvard Crimson: Can you tell us in general terms about your work in the arts and what a typical day might look like for you?
Christopher J. Hossfeld: Well, every day is different. I had a great run in Canada. Up there I was artistic director and conductor for a small opera company, which was really quite exciting. We would put on one or two productions per year—fully staged operas. So there was a lot of behind-the-scenes management for the company, which was most of the day-to-day stuff, and then right before the production, for about a month, we had rehearsals. I also had my own choir that I worked with in Montreal, and I was guest conductor for a number of ensembles, which I would go and conduct for a concert or a few rehearsals. Day to day it’s a lot of management.
THC: What are your opinions on the arts in the 21st century?
CJH: The arts in general are our social conscience, in a way. They remind us who we are and why we do what we do. They help us answer the question: What is our purpose on this planet? It’s a huge thing, and every time I try and break it down, I get a different answer because every little thing you do takes you in a different direction.
THC: What would you say to undergraduates pursuing the arts today?
CJH: One piece of advice I would give is to look at the practical side of it as well. I think the arts are so important, but the reality is that in most places today, they’re not financially supported in the way they should be. Finding funding for artistic work is going to be one of your main tasks, and that wasn’t something I realized as an undergraduate. You’re your own manager, to a certain extent. There are the lucky few artists who are part of an organization which might do these things for you, but most of us out here are doing that work ourselves.
THC: Did you know as an undergraduate that you were going to pursue music?
CJH: That was my plan. Every time I tried to go in a different direction I’d get pulled back into this path. It was less of a conscious choice as opposed to being drawn into it, and that’s the way it’s felt my whole life. The financial challenges are formidable at times, and they can be discouraging—but every time I’ve thought about doing something else, I’ve just been drawn back into it.
THC: How did attending Harvard influence you more generally?
CJH: Going through the Music Department and having such wonderful professors, in particular Robert D. Levin, really opened my eyes to different ways of looking at music, as well as how to study a composer and put together a performance. I still bring his classes with me today. Then there were the incredible resources that Harvard has—when you’re immersed in it you always take them for granted, and so it’s only when you move away that you realize, wow, that was really amazing. The performing ensembles—I sang with the Collegium Musicum, and more than anything else it taught me the business side of things and really helped prepare me for getting out into the real world.
THC: Looking forward, within the realm of your work, what are you most excited about at the moment?
CJH: I just accepted a position at a church in Hingham, Mass. I’ll be the music director, and so I’m excited about getting to know the people there! At the moment I’m mostly looking forward to getting back into the Boston music scene and finding a new direction to go in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Great Indoors,” Mike Gibbons’s new sitcom TV series on CBS, aired its pilot episode on Oct. 27. The show has some stars in its cast, and it manages a few good laughs, but does it bring anything new to the table? Probably not.
The show revolves around the office workplace of an outdoor magazine. Jack Gordon (Joel McHale) is the magazine’s rough and tough lone-wolf outdoors reporter who has dealt with grizzlies but is completely inept at dealing with modern tech (Are smartphones really that modern anymore?). The magazine’s founder, Roland (Stephen Fry), decides to downsize the establishment and, in a Newsweek move, go completely online. Jack’s outdoor explorations come to an end as he is asked to lead the team in the office under Roland’s daughter, Brooke, his ex-girlfriend. The show explores the dynamics of the relationship between techy, selfie-obsessed millennials and an old school, fax-machine-using reporter.
The show recycles the stereotypical representations of the “new” and “old” generations and their struggles in working with each other. Such representations would have been fine had the show brought some interesting twist to this overused narrative. As things stand, the stereotypes are fairly exaggerated and tend towards the predictable. While the millennials gawk at the fact that Jack does not have an Instagram, Jack repeatedly tells them to get off their screens and to stop recording everything. Jack really isn’t as old as the grandpa character into which he’s been made, and the millennials are all caricatures. There are some funny moments, but it all comes back to what the show is adding a narrative that we’ve already grown used to—and each time the answer is “not much.”
The one attribute that still makes the show appealing is the cast. With Stephen Fry and Joel McHale in the credits, it’s hard to not give the show a chance, but it is easy to be left wondering what potential Fry and McHale saw in the storyline. Fry adds his characteristic sophisticated humor at intervals, and his lines are probably the highlight of the show. One does wonder, however, why the man who has worked in classics like “Jeeves and Wooster” made the choice to link his name to “The Great Indoors.”
It seems evident that the show will not contribute much to the Gen-X vs Millennials debate, which leaves us wondering how long the show will go on at all. It will probably become clear by the next few episodes if the show will continue to make fun of pagers and “these stupid selfie sticks” or if it will offer something new. So if it’s a Saturday night, you have nowhere to be, and you’ve been wondering what Stephen Fry is up to these days, then with a pinch of salt (or several), give “The Great Indoors” a shot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fun fact: For my 10th grade precalculus project, I drew a pig named “Waddles” with a graphing calculator. It had trigonometric functions for legs, hyperbolas for cheeks, and simple lines detailing its little snout. The pig wasn’t mine. In fact, the pig wasn’t even real. Waddles—as my project stated—is a pig originally named 15 Poundie won by Mabel Pines, one of the protagonists of a Disney cartoon called “Gravity Falls.”
“Gravity Falls” in a nutshell, is about two twins—Dipper and Mabel Pines—who spend the summer in Gravity Falls, Oregon with their conman great-uncle, whom they affectionately dub “Grunkle Stan.” As the series progresses, the town’s odd and supernatural behavior pushes Dipper on a quest to unveil Gravity Falls’s secrets, with the help of a strange notebook detailing paranormal creatures and Mabel, whose collection of hand-knitted sweaters and grappling hook are representative of her adorable, can-do attitude. They encounter rainbow-vomiting gnomes, a secret society, and a mysterious entity named “Bill Cipher” who poses a looming, ominous presence over both seasons of the show.
The show—produced by Alex Hirsch—is legitimately funny. It doesn’t rely on its ridiculousness to evoke some half-hearted laughter, unlike most shows. Instead, “Gravity Falls” is surprisingly witty and self-aware. It takes old jokes, worn down by years of use on television, and turns them on their heads. “It’s covered with blood, sweat, tears, and other fluids,” Mabel says to a crowd gathered to see her life-sized wax figures. At the end of another episode, Dipper and Mabel share a tender moment. “Awkward sibling hug?” Dipper asks, holding his arms wide, his eyes darting around nervously. “Awkward sibling hug,” Mabel confirms, and the two share a sweet hug, punctuated perfectly when the two’s eyes open wide, and they say “Pat, pat” as they mechanically pat each other’s backs. The humor in “Gravity Falls” is always unexpectedly unique and well-timed.
But of course, humor isn’t enough to successfully sustain a show, and Hirsch knows that. So the comedy takes a backseat to the real plot, which stretches over the span of 40 episodes, leading to an incredible season finale. It’s here where the show’s true genius comes to light. The worldbuilding is excellent—details that may seem totally random eventually find their place. Grunkle Stan’s mysterious snack machine escapes are revealed to be integral to the plot. A giant “Time Baby” returns to fill up a plot hole. Even the gnomes of the first episode make their way into the series finale. Hirsch crafts a tightly-knit story arc that builds and builds with each episode. It’s incredibly satisfying and exciting when more questions are answered, and more questions are asked. The entire show is essentially like one big movie, with episodes that can stand alone but really shouldn’t be watched like that.
I’m convinced that “Gravity Falls” is a masterpiece, and that every aspiring storywriter—whether for novels, stages, or televisions—should watch it and take notes. Technically, the show is perfect. And emotionally, this show soars. We’re introduced to Dipper and Mabel at a sensitive and somewhat confusing time in their lives: the preteen years. So expect themes of first loves, puberty, and identity to work their way through. Their own personal struggles are reminiscent of the common challenges everyone past their teens have faced, making the show wonderfully relatable. “Gravity Falls” also touches on ideas of family, loyalty, and selfishness. Grunkle Stan struggles to live in the shadows of others. Dipper and Mabel—called the Mystery Twins—sometimes need to overcome certain differences to protect one another. Soos—a kindhearted, lovable friend and Mystery Shack worker—has a heartbreaking past involving an absent father. “Gravity Falls” is deep. It’s complex and witty and extremely well-written, and I don’t feel the least bit guilty being a fan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 6, 2016, at 12:06 a.m.
The Harvard men’s cross country team produced yearly spreadsheets about members of the women’s team, sometimes writing “sexually explicit” comments about them, according to team correspondence obtained by The Crimson.
The team created the spreadsheets each year ahead of an annual dance with the women’s team. In the documents, the men guessed which women would invite certain men to the event. In certain spreadsheets, the men added comments about the women’s physical appearance.
Details about the men’s cross country team’s spreadsheets indicate that organized written evaluations of female athletes’ physical appearances have not been limited to the men’s soccer team. Last month, The Crimson published a story about the 2012 men’s soccer team, which produced an explicit document evaluating freshmen recruits on the women’s team on their perceived sexual appeal, prompting current and former members of the cross country team to discuss their own prior practices.
In a previous cross country team’ group message, whose membership consists of current and past members of the cross country team, individuals raised concerns over previous years’ spreadsheets, including one from 2012 that contained “Specific comments about girls weight or appearance,” according to one cross country alumnus on the group message on the mobile application Group Me.
“Hahaha dude 2012 was the absolute worst I saw. It got tamer each year after that,” wrote one recent graduate.
“It’s terrible God,” agreed another member of the group, a recent College graduate.
“Also 2014 talked about a specific person getting black dick a lot," he wrote.
In an interview Saturday evening, men’s cross country captain Brandon E. Price ’17 said the team was  “particularly ashamed of” the 2014 spreadsheet, but that team culture has since shifted and the 2016 spreadsheet does not contain any lewd comments.
“We have really changed the team culture since then, and now the spreadsheet is clean and we try to refrain from making comments like that,” Price said.
Last Thursday, after the Office of the General Counsel reviewed the men’s soccer team’s “scouting report” and discovered that the practice had continued after 2012, Harvard cancelled the rest of the men’s soccer season. University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement that the men’s team had not been  “forthcoming when initially questioned” about their involvement in the “reports.”
In an email sent to members of the men’s cross country team Saturday afternoon, Price  asked the team to “come clean with anything that we have typed down in the past.” He wrote in that email he had shared a document that “contains sexually explicit content about the girls’ team” with Coach Jason S. Saretsky.
“We don’t want the school to find this, without us first bringing it to them,” Price wrote. “The problem with the Men’s Soccer team was they tried to hide their stuff.”
In their internal cross country group message, one member expressed relief that none of the spreadsheets were “as bad as anything that made the article on soccer.”
According to their messages, the multiple recent graduates of the cross country program also removed viewing permissions on some of the spreadsheets.
One member wrote that the team should restrict access to spreadsheets because of the “untrustworthies” who could view them.
“We know who they are,” the member wrote.
“Should I change the sharing on 2012?” one member asked.
“Yeah probably for the best,” another responded.
Some members of the group message also expressed concern that The Crimson would gain access to the spreadsheets, according to the correspondence.
In an interview Thursday, before The Crimson reported information about the men’s cross country team, Faust said there have been preliminary discussions as to whether traditions like the men’s soccer team’s “scouting report” take place on other teams.
“I felt it was important to at least try to get some preliminary notion of, are there people who know of other incidents, so the question has not been delved into deeply beyond the soccer team,” Faust said.
“I have asked that it at least be raised as a question: is this wider spread?” she added.
Faust also said that Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise had brought together coaches from across Harvard’s Athletics Department to discuss the cultures of their respective teams.
“Harvard Athletics does not tolerate this sort of demeaning and derogatory behavior, and we will address any credible information we receive,” Scalise wrote in an emailed statement Saturday evening.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an emailed statement that he did not know the details of the cross country spreadsheets.
“We must strive toward a culture and context of respect, dignity, and compassion - and all of us have a role to play in that work,” Khurana wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday at Harvard Stadium, there was no heartbreak for Harvard football. Only a heart attack.
After riding a wild third quarter to a 28-14 lead over Columbia (2-6, 1-4 Ivy), the Crimson conceded a late score and had to hang on for the final four minutes. But hang on Harvard did.
The result was only final when junior safety Tanner Lee corralled a Hail Mary toss. At that point, the Crimson (7-1, 5-0 Ivy) escaped with a 28-21 win and, thanks to a Penn loss to Princeton, moved into sole ownership of first in the Ivy League.
“I told them in the third quarter as soon as we got the score [of Penn-Princeton],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I went up and down the sideline and told as many guys as I could tell.”
The Lions came within seven with 4:02 left. Subbed in to replace fumble-prone starter Anders Hill, quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg marched his team 84 yards down the field and tossed a four-yard score to freshman receiver Josh Wainwright.
A three-and-out for the Harvard offense brought Mornhinweg back onto the field with a chance to tie the topsy-turvy contest. But on three of four plays, the Crimson pressured the quarterback into incompletions.
“We know they have to get the ball downfield,” said Lee, who blitzed twice in that series. “With our defensive linemen, our speed off the edge, that’s pretty tough to do.”
After another brief Harvard possession, the Lions offense had one final opportunity—in this case to go 93 yards in under a minute. The task proved too tall, as Mornhinweg failed to cross midfield before throwing the game-ending pick.
On the day, the Crimson outgained Columbia 385 to 259, with Viviano leading the way with 260 passing yards. Over 100 of those yards went to sophomore wide receiver Adam Scott, who has emerged as a real athletic threat in recent weeks.
Meanwhile the defense held the visitors to 66 total yards rushing. Noticeably absent was captain and shutdown corner Sean Ahern, who suited up but stayed on the sidelines due to an upper-body injury.
Columbia led 14-7 after two quarters, but the game took several rollercoaster turns at the start of the third.
On the opening kickoff, Harvard defensive back Cole Thompson popped the ball loose from the rookie Wainwright at the 13. When Viviano rumbled forward to set up a first-and-goal from the one, a score seemed certain.
It was not. After a false-start penalty, Viviano floated a pass into the chest of Lions standout Brock Kenyon. A late flag kept the Stadium in suspense, but eventually, with Murphy protesting on the sidelines, Columbia snapped the ball from the one.
Three plays later, Columbia coach Al Bagnoli was the one complaining. Sophomore defensive end D.J. Bailey—who has dominated competition all season—wrapped up Hill and stripped the ball at the 27.
So ended a stretch of 3:32 with three turnovers. A few plays later, sophomore running back Charlie Booker bounced to the outside and streaked untouched for a 15-yard score. Game tied at 14.
“Energy—that’s what changed at halftime,” Lee said. “On offense, Joe Viviano [was] getting everybody fired up, so I think that’s what sparked our third quarter.”
The go-ahead touchdown came five minutes later. First the Crimson had to overcome a third-and-10 from the Lions 38. Brazenly Columbia lined up for an all-out blitz, leaving only three defensive backs for single coverage.
In playground fashion, Viviano lobbed the ball to Scott, who hauled in the 32-yard gain. Soon after, senior halfback Anthony Firkser grabbed a wide-open touchdown—his seventh of the year. The Lions never led again.
Harvard’s 28 points belied the talent of the Columbia defense. In the first 30 minutes, the Lions recorded five quarterback takedowns and forced five punts.
Yet it was special teams more than defense that gave the Lions an early lead. Two Harvard miscues in particular shaped the opening half.
Punt returner Alex LaPolice committed the first mistake. In position to return a high floating punt, the sophomore let the ball slip through his hands. Free safety Ryan Gilbert recovered, and six plays later, Hill slung a back-shoulder touchdown to freshman Ronald Smith II.
The second miscue had a more immediate impact. Four minutes into the second quarter, junior Zach Schmid lined up for a punt. The Lions, who had previously focused on return blocking, decided to bring heavy pressure.
Linebacker Michael Murphy got to Schmid first. The Tampa, Fla. native blocked the kick, and teammate Hunter Lunsford scooped up the ball and rumbled to the end zone.
Harvard hadn’t trailed in regulation since Oct. 15. But on this Saturday afternoon, the team faced a 14-7 deficit at the half.
“It was a little bit frustrating,” Viviano said. “The way we played in the first half, we all knew that’s not the way we were supposed to be playing.”
The Crimson seemed ready to even the score midway through the second quarter, when the team moved 85 yards to the Columbia one. Then Murphy faced a key decision: to kick a field goal or try for a touchdown.
He chose the more aggressive route. Viviano faked pistol formation before snapping under center—something the Crimson offense rarely does. The lack of practice showed, as Viviano mishandled the ball and crumpled to the turf. Roars from the Lions sideline.
The third-quarter flood of turnovers and points erased the pain of that mishap. The Harvard surge was complete when senior defensive tackle Doug Webb stripped Hill at the Lions' 22.
On the next play, a delayed screen left Scott wide open on the sideline. Like a track sprinter, he dashed straight into the end zone.
That score was the sophomore’s second of the game. He recorded his first on Harvard’s fourth drive of the game.
Facing a third-and-one from the Columbia 29, Murphy gambled for a big gain, sending Scott on a deep go route. Viviano—who has struggled at times with long passes—nailed this one, lofting the ball over cornerback Cameron Roane and into Scott’s hands.
Little could anyone know at the time, but those seven points proved crucial on an afternoon when the Lions refused to go away.
“Our kids know that there’s so much parity in our league,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They know that a lot of games are going to come down to the wire, so you’ve got to be a good fourth quarter team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You’re not going into a game looking out for… I can’t pronounce his name.”
While Cornell men’s hockey coach Mike Schafer may have had a bit of trouble in his postgame presser Saturday night, the head of the Big Red was right on the money with his assessment: you don’t go into a game looking to shut down a forward with four goals to his name. No matter how difficult that name may be to pronounce.
But hockey’s a funny game, and accordingly, Saturday night belonged to sophomore Lewis Zerter-Gossage. Harvard’s newest top-line right winger netted his first career hat trick over the span of two periods, lifting the No. 12/12 Crimson to a 4-3 victory over rival Cornell at a rowdy, jam-packed Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
“Obviously coming into the game, I had different priorities than scoring three goals,” Zerter-Gossage said. “I always thought it’d be nice, but I didn’t think scoring my first goal at the Bright would end up being in the same game as my second and third.”
Yet that’s exactly what happened. Zerter-Gossage’s first career Bright-Landry goal came on Harvard’s very first shot of the night, his second was a product of the Crimson’s first power play, and his third served as the game-winner.
Meanwhile, Ryan Donato, the sophomore’s linemate and classmate, assisted on all three goals and scored one of his own. Previously, all three members of the top line—including co-captain Alexander Kerfoot—had spoken about how the combination continued to be a work in progress, so Saturday’s four-goal outburst came as a welcoming sight for the hosts.
“With two new guys on [that line], it’s taken a little bit of time to gel,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They’ve been working, but now they’re starting to learn each other’s tendencies.”
Nonetheless, penalties nearly spoiled the show. The Crimson (3-0-1, 1-0-1 ECAC) was whistled for six infractions, and Cornell (0-2-1, 0-1-1)—playing without Jeff Kubiak, its leading point-getter from a year ago—turned three of them into power-play goals. Ryan Donato went to the box twice, and each time, the Big Red converted its opportunity within 25 seconds.
The second such instance occurred with less than a minute to play in the second period. Cornell forward Anthony Angello’s one-timer from just outside the left post cut the Big Red deficit to 4-2. Then with only four seconds to go in the frame, Adam Fox took a holding penalty that led to another goal off a one-timer down low—this time from Cornell captain Jake Weidner—in the opening minute of the third.
“We had a few self-inflicted wounds,” Ted Donato said. “We’re up 4-1 and have the game in a good spot, and then we start the parade to the penalty box.”
Cornell had a chance to blow the roof off the building—which was largely populated by Big Red fans—when a Jacob Olson slash put the visitors on yet another man advantage about a minute after Weidner’s tally. But Cornell came up empty. Harvard actually allowed just four shots across the Big Red’s six power plays; but three of them wound up in the back of the net.
“It’s been a little bit strange because we haven’t been under a lot of pressure,” Ted Donato said of his penalty killing unit. “We’ve done a really good job of denying entrance, we’ve done a really good job of getting to loose pucks. But the chances that we did give up were obviously great chances, so that’s something we’ll continue to work on.”
Even with Cornell failing to connect on its final power play of the contest, Weider’s goal set the stage for a tense final frame. But ultimately, the four goals from Harvard’s first line proved to be enough.
Zerter-Gossage’s big night began 1:25 into the contest after Ryan Donato stole the puck off the stick of Big Red defenseman Holden Anderson and broke free along the left wing. On the developing 2-on-1, Donato fed the puck over to Zerter-Gossage in the slot, and the Montreal native threw a wrister on net that hit senior goaltender Mitch Gillam and trickled in.
Harvard’s 1-for-1 start in the scoring department marked a dramatic shift from its 1-for-42 showing against Colgate the night before. And as Ryan Donato said after the game, once the Crimson got one, they kept on pumping goals in.
Harvard added to its lead with 2:32 remaining in the first, as Zerter-Gossage tipped a Tyler Moy shot past Gillam. Then atoning for a penalty that enabled Cornell to cut the gap in half, Ryan Donato slotted a wrap-around attempt past Gillam late in the second—a goal Schafer described as “the killer” which brought the score to 3-1.
Less than two minutes later, Donato created more trouble for Gillam. His drive to the net forced the puck to squirt over to Zerter-Gossage, who flipped a back-hander over Gillam and skated straight for the Harvard student section to celebrate his first career hat trick.

The victory marks the Crimson’s first win at home against Cornell since February 2009. The two teams will battle again in Ithaca, New York on Jan. 27, 2017.
“It’s such a great rivalry—much greater than any one person or coach,” Ted Donato said. “For me just to continue to be part of this great rivalry with all the great players that have gone through, it’s pretty fun.”

It looks like Big Brother is back again, but now in an astonishingly modern get-up. As of mid-October, Big Brother’s not letting you pick you Tinder pictures, but rather, he’s picking them for you.
Not only is Tinder advertising your appearance by presenting pictures of you to potential matches, but now, the app deems which pictures are most ‘successful,’ and selects them as your profile’s pictures. For example, if that double-chinned photo of you for some odd reason isn’t as popular as that photo from your Cancun trip, Tinder will automatically prioritize that photo.
That’s right. The dating scene has become a virtual bricolage of marketing and sex appeal, facilitated by an omniscient computer program.
Many complain that Tinder is forcibly depicting people one way or another, when they have specifically designed their profile to come off a certain way. Many Harvard students have recently expressed their disapproval of the update. Irla Belli ’20 said the new update is “degrading, and frightfully ridiculous.” Eugene Oh ’20 said, “I think it’s very superficial, but Tinder in itself is. Typical Tinder, honestly, it’s what you’d expect.”
However, some students express approval the update, as Ashish Dahal ’20 said, “It’s good that Tinder is using technology in a way that will make users’ experience better. It will definitely be helpful to Tinder users to know which profile works best for them.” While this opinion exists, it is definitely an unpopular on–the student body seems to generally be opposed to the update.
In an ideal world, people would date solely based off of personal disposition. But in reality, we need that “tinder” to get the fire starting.
