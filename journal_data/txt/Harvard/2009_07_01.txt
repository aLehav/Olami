VENICE, Italy — Venice presents a visual marathon, hinting at a city that can never hold enough examples of different methods of presentation, decoration, or commemoration. From the Renaissance paintings by Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese to the Gothic architecture of the basilicas, from the gaudy Venetian masks that are marketed to tourists to the simple red geranium flowers that bedeck the palazzos of the Grand Canal, one’s eyes are eternally entertained.
Every other year, the Venice Biennale—a vast and international contemporary art exhibition—increases this sense of visual bombardment. The city’s vistas are adorned by banners that display the Biennale’s trademark red, square logo. They announce the performances, special events and exhibitions that go on until November, held mostly in the national pavilions in the public gardens of the Giardini—the main site of the Biennale—but throughout the city’s various “sestieres” as well. 
Sometimes, the city’s offerings become overwhelming, and it is at times like these that a distinct simplicity of statement affirms the worth of being surrounded by such artistic and historic treasures. Ezra Pound’s grave, lying in San Michele Cemetery, is one such visual relief from the abundance of ornamentation that sometimes overflows in Venice. The remarkable sense of contrast that it gives causes one to appreciate the city’s treasures even more.
In order to get to the grave, one must travel by vaporetto, the main form of public transportation, to a little island across a plane of water that lies to the north of the main island in the lagoon. You step right off the boat at Cimitero, where the city’s inhabitants—born high or low—rest in peace. At first, the expected emphasis on decoration can be found in the multiple bunches of flowers and ribbons, the specially-posed portrait photos that flutter by the graves, and especially the family-commissioned tombs that boast mosaic exteriors or neoclassical columns.
But Pound’s resting place is barely a tombstone. His plot is lined with a low marble border, and a large laurel bush dominates the space inside. Underneath, partially covered by ivy strands, is a small, marble plaque bearing the simple demarcation: “Ezra Pound.” In equal distance on the other side of the plot lies the plaque commemorating Olga Rudge, Pound’s long-term lover and intellectual companion. Passersby would not find the spot unless they knew that it simply had to be there, according to the map that underlines the “anyone who’s anyone” figures. (The modernist composer Igor Stravinsky lies in the next courtyard). 
Perhaps it is just the act of getting out of the immediate city, or the blast of fresh air that one gets due to the traverse across to the tiny island, but Pound’s plaque gives a profound sense of relief. Maybe it is the sheer lack of graveyard pomp that calms his visitors, or the quirky fact that he lies in the “Rec Evangelical” (along with many other German, American, and British figures) that makes the pilgrimage to his grave shorn of the formalities of commemorative splendor and ostentation. Here, when one encounters a distinct lack of assured beautification, it does not seem for lack of intent to celebrate the object, or its meaning. Or perhaps it is because, apart from a lone sprig of daisies strewn by the plaque, previous devotees had placed plastic Bic pens and pencils by his name, maybe in the innocent and poignant hope that his brilliant literary genius might be conferred back to them. 
The city of Venice seems to physically contract every two years when the Biennale brings hordes of museum directors, curators, collectors, and art world luminaries into the city for “Vernissage,” the opening week of parties, private viewings, and prize-giving. This period has the effect of overwhelming those who can just barely fathom the city’s permanent artistic highlights. So, even without the incessant chatter and social whirlwinds that begin the Biennale, a water-bound escape to the Cimitero would benefit anyone who feels relentlessly confronted by visual masterpieces and glories. Of course, one of the delights of Venice is the sheer supply of these works—there is always one more Carpaccio to see. But Ezra Pound’s minimalist plot provides a welcome respite from the grandeur of conventional and commercial beauty.

To the editor:
After reading the piece by Sara Roy in your Commencement Issue (“The Peril of Forgetting Gaza,” Opinion, June 4), I must express my bewilderment that the well-respected Crimson would allow such a one-sided piece to be printed.  Ms. Roy fails to mention major facts that have contributed to the tragic condition of Gaza’s people since 1949.  
Ms. Roy’s bias against Israel is well documented.  Her review of the book Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad was rejected by Tufts University’s Fletcher Forum on World Affairs as “all reviewers found the piece one-sided.” Ms. Roy ignores the major source of Gaza’s tragic situation: Hamas, internationally recognized as a terrorist group whose military power is growing thanks to abundant support from the Iranian regime.  Since 2006, when Hamas won Gaza’s elections, it has failed to fulfill any of the promises it made to Gaza’s people and dashed all their hopes for a better life.  
Instead of working to improve living conditions in Gaza, Hamas has used its governing power to launch innumerable terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and to start a civil war in the West Bank and Gaza to try to vanquish its arch-rival, Fatah. Gaza’s ruling party has been responsible for horrifying atrocities in Israel, including exploding buses and attacks on shopping malls and peaceful religious gatherings. Hamas has been steadfast in its refusal to consider recognizing Israel’s right to exist and has no plans to pursue peace talks with Israel for the good of the people of Gaza.  
Everyone blames Israel for the Gazans’ plight.  No one talks about the treatment of Gaza’s inhabitants during 19 years of Egyptian rule (1949-67), nor about the fact that, during that period, the Arab world and the international community largely ignored the plight of the residents, who have been deliberately kept in “refugee camps” for close to 60 years instead of being allowed to build new lives for themselves.  
In the words of Professor Amnon Rubinstein, a respected parliamentarian identified with the Israeli Left, in the Jerusalem Post, March 31, 2009: “The suffering of the people of Gaza is…[a] tragedy…[that] could disappear overnight if Gaza was governed by leaders who prefer life and peace to death and war.”

ROME, Italy – The poster is all over Rome: “Ci chiami sporco negro e lesbica schifosa. Ma ti offendi se ti chiamamo Italiano mafioso—You call us dirty black man and disgusting lesbian.  But you are offended if we call you Italian mafioso.” A bald black man and grey-haired white women are depicted smiling and looking straight ahead. Both appear to be naked, though only their top halves are showing; they have crossed arms (a signal of strength, or perhaps a way of concealing the woman’s breasts?). 
The poster is the brainchild of Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana (The Italian Recreational and Cultural Association), a non-for-profit organization that promotes tolerance. It represents the launching of their new campaign against discrimination of all kinds. The first time I saw it, I smiled. This was the “screw you, Lega Nord” that I had been waiting for, that I had been wanting to shout out loud since the very beginning of my stay in Rome. Let me explain. 
The second day I was in Rome the EU and municipal election results were announced in the papers. I was shocked by what I read: The Lega Nord (the Northern League), a party whose platform is based on the federalization of Italy and has, at times, suggested that the north of Italy secede, managed to get 10 percent of the vote. I knew that the Lega made up part of the current government, but I had always thought that it was simply one of those flukes of a parliamentary system. (An attempt to build a coalition sometimes involves including tiny—and occasionally crazy—political parties). 
A quick glance at the papers told me, however, that I was stuck in the past. The Lega Nord no longer simply spelled federalism and social conservatism. No, this right-wing-populist party had taken a different direction: anti-immigration policy. In fact, in 2002, a politician associated with the party had gone so far as to suggest that immigrants and native Italians should take different trains. And not long after that, Giancarlo Gentili, a Lega member and, at the time, mayor of Treviso, proposed that Italians shoot immigrants like rabbits. 
Suddenly, I wasn’t shocked, I was sick. How could it be that this clearly xenophobic party had won 10 percent of the vote? Some dismissed the ballots cast for the Lega as “protest votes,” but I don’t agree. Italy has plenty of tiny parties that those who feel disenfranchised could support instead of the Lega. Yet the suggestion that 10 percent of Italians are just plain racist also seems too simplistic. I have decided that my mission this summer is to understand what has happened in Italy’s psyche to bring it to this point. So far, the answer I’ve come up with is twofold. 
Firstly, Italy is having a bit of an identity crisis. The country isn’t quite certain if it is the globe’s museum or a world power. Walking through the streets of Rome, you see a mélange of ancient ruins, renaissance churches, and fascistic structures. Even the people are old.  “Look,” it all seems to say, “once we were powerful; once it was great to be Italian.” Now, residents of the eternal city hardly seem to know what it means to be citizens of their country.  The Tangentopoli corruption scandal of the ‘90s branded Italian politics as full of inept bureaucrats and smarmy opportunists. The current sex controversy adds to the country’s image as a paradoxical place: It is both the epicenter of the Catholic world and yet its citizens seem to display a chauvinistic and shameless licentiousness. On top of that, a land that was previously thought of not simply as ethnically homogenous, but as a country of emigrants, Italy is more and more a country of immigrants (with 3.7 million documented immigrants and between .8-2 million undocumented immigrants).  
Yet, Italy’s identity crisis has been going on for at least 15 years, if not more. Why would anti-immigration sentiment become increasingly popular and widespread now? To understand the second aspect of this xenophobia, I draw upon a lesson I learned from Ec10 (words I thought I would never write): Times of crisis, in particular slow economic growth, are bad for democracy. William Joseph Maier Professor of Political Economy Professor Benjamin M. Friedman’s April 6th lecture, “The Economic and Financial Crisis: Also a Moral Threat,” suggested that anti-immigration policy in the U.S. was correlated with times of economic downturn. Italy is certainly facing a rough economy.  Just two weeks ago the The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development released a report stating that the organization did not see an end in sight to the Italian recession. Following Friedman’s hypothesis, it would make sense that xenophobic tendencies might rear their ugly heads right about now.
While I am certain I have only begun to scratch the surface when it comes to understanding this complex socio-political issue, I want to emphasize that I am seeking to explain, not to condone. This xenophobic strain of Italian politics is a danger to the country. Finding a scapegoat in times of economic instability never solves anything, as the past century has made Europe well aware. Furthermore, in difficult times nations should be cooperating, attempting to find a global solution. This is not the time for fruitless and misguided nationalism. 
There is much to learn from ARCI’s anti-discrimination campaign, not simply from the poster, but also from its powerful and somewhat eerie slogan: “Il razzismo e un boomerang, prima o poi ti ritorna—Racism is a boomerang, sooner or later it comes back at you.”

AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands — Within five minutes of stepping off the train and onto the platform in Central Station when I arrived here earlier this month, I got a taste of the “typical Dutch” bluntness that my fellowship coordinators warned the nine other American students and me about.
Our host families huddled in a group inside the station, each visibly eager to greet the American to whom they had voluntarily offered room and board (read: a cot and waffles) for the month, free of charge. Other than their height—one woman towered above me at a jaw-dropping 6’1”—what struck me about the families was what they represented, or failed to represent. Collectively, they showcased nearly every social variation possible, from age to sexual orientation. My own host family included a self-professed socialist lawyer and a pregnant Green Peace employee, both of whom view marriage as unnecessary and have decided to remain in a “partnership” despite the imminent arrival of their first child.
Still, all the families were “native Dutch,” the politically correct term for “white” in this country.
Of course, this didn’t bother me in the least. But it might help explain why the first exchange with one of the host “mothers” went something like this.
Me: "Hi, I’m from America. Good to meet you."
Mother: "Hi there. Are you Moroccan?"
Non-sequitur, much?
In our country, such a question—as impulsive as it seems—would rarely garner anything but a short laugh and clarification from me, or, I think it’s safe to say, from anyone who looks remotely Arab. But in Holland, as I soon found out, Moroccans possess a universally-accepted, second-class social status—as do most other “allochtoon,” a now-derogatory word for “immigrant.” Ask any Dutch person, and he or she will (bluntly) tell you the same.
To be sure, the host mom’s question was indeed a loaded one. It reflected a deep preoccupation with ethnicity in Dutch society—a preoccupation that exists even in Amsterdam, a city renowned for its tolerance.
But she wouldn’t be the last “native Dutch” to ask me if I was Moroccan.
Just last week, I interviewed a professor at the University of Amsterdam for my research. At the conclusion of our hour-long discussion, she (bluntly) asked me, “Were your parents born in Morocco?”
And the week before, I was asked essentially the same question at a soiree in Frankendael Park, though the man arguably had a bit more social grace than the other two (i.e. he didn’t explicitly mention “Morocco” or “Moroccan”). In the middle of our conversation, he (again, bluntly) interjected, “What’s your background? Arab?”
I would never have expected to arrive at such a conclusion, but after working in Amsterdam for the past month, I’ve realized that I’ve never traveled to or lived in a place where I’ve felt more conscious of my skin color than this one.
If someone were to ask me about my ethnic background in Cambridge, I would equate the question with an invitation to discuss my mixed ancestry—my father is Libyan, and my mother is German.
But the Dutch, in general, seem to take stereotypes to the extreme. I’ve learned from other “allochtoon” how insulting such a question actually is here. “It implies you don’t belong,” one woman, who is originally from South Korea, told me.
For Arabs, the situation is worse. To assume a young man is “Moroccan” is to assume he is a juvenile delinquent, said Frank Bovenkerk, a former professor of criminology at the University of Utrecht.
“Here, it’s very popular to focus on race and ethnicity,” Bovenerk told me after a guest lecture I attended two weeks ago. “Xenophobia is rampant—to the point that minorities are actually afraid of deportation.”
As an outsider, it baffles me how this could ever happen in The Netherlands. During World War II, it was the advanced Dutch system of registering ethnic minorities that facilitated the deportation and subsequent extermination of innocent Jews from this country. Though the Dutch have since trumpeted the mantra of “never again,” has their society really learned its lesson?
I’m a little afraid to get the blunt answer.

Hartford, Conn. – Question 1: Connecticut needs $8.8 billion to balance its budget. Should the state A) raise taxes or B) cut spending? Democrats, who control two-thirds of the legislature, say the answer is both of the above. But Governor Jodi Rell, a Republican, says raising taxes is the wrong choice. On prudence, Rell scores high: Raising taxes will slow the recovery, so the state should cut spending instead.
“We need to conserve the services that are absolutely necessary to our economy,” said State Senator Mary Ann Handley, a Democrat. But which services are “necessary”? Though Democrats sliced $2 billion from the budget, they saved items that were less than essential, like $12 million for the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities and $1 million for the Latino and Puerto Rican Affairs Commission. When the state is losing money, it should keep the agencies that provide services, not the commissions that provide forums.
State Representative Ryan Barry, a Democrat, defends the commissions: “They are advocating for people who can’t afford lobbyists.” True, but the state is cutting services at the same time that it is paying commissioners up to $150,000 per year. For example, Rell wants to cut $1.4 million in subsidies for a LIFE STAR helicopter at Hartford Hospital. She could pay for this item with money saved by closing commissions. Then, Democrats could say they cut the fat before reaching into taxpayers’ pockets. Besides, most people would take a helicopter over a lobbyist. 
Instead of taking this route, Democrats plan to raise the income tax from a flat 5 percent to 6 percent for couples making $500,000 per year, 6.5 percent for couples making $600,000 per year, and 7.5 percent for couples making $750,000 per year. Businesses would bear a temporary 25 percent surcharge. Democrats think these hikes are fair. A couple making $600,000 per year would pay only $1000 more in income taxes.
Republicans, however, fear the rich will skedaddle. “The wealthy can move their tax home easily,” said State Representative Pam Sawyer, a Republican. Democrats are skeptical. “No one is going to move out of the state because we have an income tax of 6.5 percent. New Jersey is almost 9 percent or more. Massachusetts has a capital gains tax; we got rid of that,” said Barry. He has a point. Few people will move from Connecticut because of these changes. 
But few people will move to Connecticut because of them, either. “Companies in New York have told us they are considering moving to Connecticut for lower taxes. We need to keep the state competitive,” said Sawyer. And there’s no guarantee the surcharge will be temporary. For the next two years, federal stimulus money will fund 17 percent of the deficit. Extra credit: What happens when that money disappears?
“Starting in 2012, we have another $4 billion deficit,” warned State Senator Dan Debicella, a Republican. Any estimate of the deficit's size, however, depends on your expectations. “We are operating on the assumption that in a couple of years the economy will come back,” Handley admited. In that case, legislators will be able to lower taxes. This assumption is reasonable, but risky. Higher taxes will scare businesses from Connecticut, slowing the recovery. And when the economy rebounds, stuffed coffers will tempt legislators to spend even more.
The state should cut spending and keep taxes low. Does government spend to serve or serve to spend? On this question, too many legislators leave their answers blank.

NEW YORK, N.Y. — When riding the subway, don't talk too loud or take up too much space or make eye contact. Read a book. Listen to music. Ignore people.
The doors slid open at Seventh Avenue. In walked three couples, dressed in khaki walking shorts, bright round-neck T-shirts, and white, white sneakers. Backpacks and baseball caps, too. The E train lurched forward.
“What stop do you think it is?” a woman asked. She sprawled across the bench, right next to me.
A man looked at a map. “Ground Zero is at the World Trade Center stop,” he said. "I guess."
The woman turned to me. “Is that right?” she asked. Oh no, I thought, eye contact.
“Um, yes,” I said, because it was.
“Oh good,” she said. A pause. Then:
“Do you ride this every day for work?” she asked.
“Yes,” I said, because I did. I thought monosyllabic answers would prevent a conversation.
“Do you work in one of those tall buildings? I think I'd get dizzy,” her friend said. She laughed. I explained that I only worked on the seventh floor, and that it was very stable. I laughed too.
The tourists—from Louisiana—only had 24 hours in New York City, one stop on their five-day cruise around the Northeast. We discussed the ins-and-outs of the hop-on/hop-off bus. I asked if they had been to Central Park, to Broadway, or to museums. They hadn't. Not the MoMA or the Met or even the Museum of Natural History. They seemed like pretty lousy tourists.
“We wanted to see Ground Zero,” she said. They wanted to see where it happened. I hadn't even thought of that as a sight-seeing option. She asked, “Were you here, hon?”
“Yes,” I said, because I was.
“We were so sorry for you all,” she said. She reached out and touched my shoulder.
On 9/11, I was in school, far uptown. My family had moved to New York two weeks earlier. I wasn't a New Yorker, then, and it didn't feel like my tragedy. It wasn't my city—well, not yet, anyway.
A month later, my dad took my brother, sisters, and me to see Ground Zero—the cranes, the skeletons of buildings. My dad put his hands on our shoulders. We watched as machines moved, then sorted, the debris. We were tourists, too.
“We were so sorry for you all,” she said. I didn't know what to say, so I thanked her and that seemed right. Then at the Spring Street stop, I got up.
“Wait,” the woman said, “Is it true there are grocery stores in the apartment buildings here?”
“Yes,” I said, because I wanted it to be true. For them, at least. The tourists waved as the train pulled away. I waved back.

NEW YORK, N.Y. – It was Monday morning—a little over a week after my first day at The New York Observer—and the interns were sitting around, waiting for the managing editor to arrive. But after an hour, there was no sign.
Then he walked in, beard unshaven, looking distraught. Earlier, one intern had told me she’d heard that he had been laid off. He quickly gathered us in an unlit office (with some sunlight) to confirm the news.
“I knew that there would have to be layoffs, but I wasn’t expecting this,” he said, holding up the manila folder. “I was looking forward to working with you guys the whole summer.”
“At least this means the newspaper will survive the summer,” he added, trying to be optimistic. “And you guys will get to write more, so take advantage of it. Even when it’s a bloodbath, some people can come out stronger.”
That was the last time we would see him: The managing editor and the other writers and editors who were laid off had to move out of the office that day.
Our managing editor was supposed to be the friendly face that would guide us through the summer: giving us articles to fact-check, referring us to editors for articles to write, and integrating us with the rest of the staff. He was the one who’d hired us in the first place, interviewed us on the phone or in person. But no one was safe anymore.
He was right that the interns would get to write more. So far, every one of us has been getting at least one or two bylines online a week, sometimes every day. While we were awkwardly relegated to a side room before, now we have desks in the center of the newsroom. We no longer have to fact-check every print article for the week’s paper: Fact-checking (by interns) has been abolished. Now, we simply report and write. 
It’s exciting—even liberating—to feel as though I have a real job. But what’s going to happen to those desks in the middle of the newsroom come the end of the summer? There will be fall interns, but is this sustainable?
I still remember Peter W. Kaplan ’76’s last day as editor-in-chief—it was my first day on the job. He was leaving for Conde Nast Traveler as their new creative director, to cook up ideas for saving journalism, but wouldn’t say good-bye without meeting the new interns.
Sitting on the back counter in the conference room, with his gray hair swept across his forehead and his horn-rimmed glasses facing us, he asked each intern a series of questions to test us out, get to know us better. When he asked one girl what she wanted to do after college, she said law school; he affirmed that as a secure path. Another intern said that she really wanted to go into journalism; he asked, “Are you sure?” When a third intern told him she was a literature major at Bard, he said that she’s undoubtedly going to become a literature professor.
Then he got to me. He asked what I wanted to do for a living; I said print journalism. This time, he didn’t discourage. After more questioning, he asked what House I lived in; I said Winthrop. He told me he’d also lived in Winthrop (“Eh, it wasn’t great,” he said of the rooming.). But the next thing he said came as more of a surprise:
“What do you care about?”
It took a while for the question to even register. “Um…”
He gestured and asked, “What do you want to write about?”
“Oh. Um…media and politics and education.”
My answer seemed adequate, so he nodded and began to interrogate the next subject.
That may have been the only time I interacted with Kaplan, but that question—and my hesitation—have stuck with me. In late May, I barely knew what real estate was—now it’s my beat, and I’ve loved working on every article I’ve written so far. So, if my preferences change so easily, what do I care about? And why am I so intent on going into journalism in the first place?
No matter the medium or subject matter, journalists need to provide a sustained check on power now more than ever before. Climate change is worsening, the financial crisis could leave the United States permanently weaker, and even just neglecting to repair an airplane or subway train can render consequences. So, even though the castle of print journalism is falling, a stronger city—with buildings old and new—needs to rise from this siege soon.
What do I care about? Simply journalism. That will always need writing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School laid off 12 staff members last week as part of its effort to reduce the size of its workforce by about 10 percent, acting Dean Howell E. Jackson announced in an e-mail to the Law School community last Tuesday. 
Because the Law School's share of endowment payout for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 may fall by as much as $19 million from this past year's payout, administrators have come to view layoffs as a "painful" but necessary cost-cutting measure taken only after an "exhaustive look at all other possibilities," Jackson wrote. Staff attrition and redeployment, along with the University's voluntary early retirement incentive program, already helped to achieve most of the necessary downsizing.
"Nothing I say here will bring much comfort to those who will be impacted the most, but I can tell you that every one of these decisions has been extremely tough to make," he wrote.
While its expenditures have been relatively conservative in past years, the Law School remains dependent on endowment revenue for 37 percent of its operating budget. A payout decline of $19 million would represent over 10 percent of the School's current budget, and earlier this spring, the Law School's departments were each directed to cut costs by about 10 percent.
Like other University employees who have been recently laid off, workers at the Law School received a transition package that includes an extension of their health insurance for 12 months and access to job search services. They will continue to be paid for 60 days after receiving notification of the termination of their employment.
The layoffs were spread across departments and included management staff, but Law School officials declined to specify the exact financial impact of the cuts. 
After the staff reductions conclude, the remaining workforce for fiscal year 2010 should number about 500 employees—a size similar to that in 2005, when the University's endowment was roughly the same size as it is today, following the 30 percent decline projected for the past fiscal year.
This past spring, 25 of 72 eligible Law School employees accepted buyouts from the University. Administrators further reduced the personnel budget by eliminating some vacant positions and visiting faculty appointments, freezing faculty and non-union staff salaries, and slashing faculty allowances. Professors and senior administrators have also pledged several hundred thousand dollars in donations to help offset the budget gap.
To cope with a shortage of visiting faculty members in the fall, current professors will teach more core courses, and some will take on a heavier teaching load than required.
But even with these cost-cutting measures, the threat of layoffs had loomed since April, when Jackson said at a town hall meeting that further staff reductions would likely be needed to bring the School's costs in line with its new financial realities. 
“These are material changes that will affect our budgets in future years,” Jackson said in an interview in May. “We will need to reduce our staff levels in order to live within our new means.” 
As a temporary replacement for former Law School Dean Elena Kagan, who stepped down after being confirmed as U.S. Solicitor General, Jackson took an unusually active role in shaping the Law School during his brief three month deanship. Kagan departed in March without making any budgetary announcements to the Law School community, and due to the tight budget approval timeline, the decision fell to Jackson to move forward with involuntary workforce cuts.
In an e-mail, Jackson said that although Martha Minow, the newly appointed Law School dean who assumes her position July 1, was not involved in the decision-making process, he expects her to ease smoothly into her new role.
"We have a very strong senior administrative staff at the Law School," he wrote, "and I am sure they will do a terrific job supporting the new dean."
—Staff writer Athena Y. Jiang can be reached at ajiang@fas.harvard.edu.CORRECTION: An earlier online version of the July 1 article "Law School Lays Off 12" gave an incorrect middle initial for the acting dean of the Law School. His name is Howell E. Jackson, not Howell L. Jackson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unusual slew of drug-related violence in Cambridge during the last two months has prompted city leaders to expand the local police presence and increase public outreach in an effort to quell residents’ unease.
Most city officials said that although the warmer months usually bring a higher rate of crime and violence, this year’s sudden uptick in shootings and stabbings has been uncommon.
“I think it is fair to say this is more than your typical summer emergence of greater incidence of crime and potentially violence,” City Councillor Sam Seidel said. “There seems to be something happening that requires real attention.”     
According to Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas, there are approximately eight to ten shooting incidents in the City annually. But this year, as of last month, there have already been at least eight—seven of which occurred during the months of May and June.
Haas said that most of the violence is drug-related, but both he and Mayor E. Denise Simmons said that rumors of an escalating drug war are not currently substantiated.
“I would not call it a drug war,” Simmons said. “It has not been defined to me by the police as a drug war.”
So far, the violence—which has included at least three stabbing incidents—has resulted in the deaths of two men: Justin Cosby, who was shot in Kirkland House at Harvard on May 18, and Jason Ellcock, whose body was found on Rindge Ave. on June 16. 
The latest incident took place on June 21, when a 22-year-old man was shot in the leg while getting out of his car in the same North Cambridge neighborhood where Ellcock was shot. While no suspects have yet been apprehended in the case, the victim was arrested for illegally possessing his own gun, said Cambridge Police Spokesman Frank T. Pasquarello.
Haas said the recent spate of shootings has been notable because many of them occurred in the same geographical area—in most cases, in North Cambridge—at around the same time. 
He said that “the dynamics of the shootings” this year have also been different. Usually, and as was the case last summer, the city encounters a series of related “retaliatory” shootings in which perpetrators attack each other, Haas said.
But this year, he said, the incidents may stem from two or three separate conflicts, although he added that it was too early to state which events might be related since investigations are still active.
Pasquarello did confirm that there is no evidence of a connection between the recent North Cambridge incidents and the Harvard shooting.
Despite reassurances from police, City Councillor Craig A. Kelley said some residents are worried.
“Residents have e-mailed me, they’ve stalked me on the street, they’ve called me,” he said. “People are concerned that what started out as a shooting here and a shooting there and a shooting some place else is spreading into something bigger, wider, more serious, with more potential fallout.”
Kelley said that even though the shootings have not involved random victims, the violence is nevertheless unsettling. 
“Bullets don’t really care who they’re targeted for,” he said. “People shouldn’t be targeted in the first place. The fact that someone was a drug dealer and got killed doesn’t mean they are a pariah [who doesn’t] mean something to someone.”
Haas said the police department has taken measures to ensure residents’ safety, including bolstering regular walking patrols and deploying supplemental bike patrols. 
He also noted that Cambridge, unlike many other cities, uses a strategic deployment system that is based on accumulated crime and violence statistics. Areas with high levels of suspicious activity are sent more police personnel, and he encouraged residents to report incidents and to check the daily police crime log posted online.
“There’s the notion that the police can do it all, but that’s erroneous. Without the partnership of the community, it makes it very difficult to prevent or stop crime from happening,” Haas said.
Simmons, who issued a statement last week pledging to address residents’ concerns about safety, said she and the City Council would be working closely with the police department, as well as representatives from the Cambridge Housing Authority and private real estate management companies, to formulate proposals for curbing crime and violence.
No official plans have been announced so far, but Simmons emphasized that the City’s safety has always been a priority and said that conversations about crime and violence prevention have been ongoing.   
“It looks like we’re responding but what we’re implementing now are things we’ve thought about prior to these events,” Simmons said.
But Kelley said he believes that resolving the issue of drug-related violence will require looking beyond immediate solutions such as increasing police patrols and establishing social programs.
“At the end of the day, what we really need to do is reevaluate our war on drugs,” he said. “A lot of it has to do with the abysmal way we’ve been addressing our drug issues. It’s not really a surprise that we have systemic violence developing from that.”
Pasquarello, the police spokesman, said he suspects this kind of violence would decrease if convicted perpetrators could be retained in jail indefinitely, rather than be released to become repeat offenders. He said that the people involved in the recent incidents were “not strangers” to the police department, and Haas said that a number of the individuals were in fact released from prison around the same time as each other. 
But Haas added that he is not sure if this was a major factor in this year’s flare-up of violence, and also pointed out that maintaining enough prisons, which are often already overcrowded, can be expensive and impractical.
“We know that there’s a certain portion of the population that gets released that will become reengaged in the activities for which they are arrested,” he said. “Having said that, you can’t just lock up people for the rest of their lives based on what you may think they might do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School announced last week that it would lay off 16 of its more than 1,000 employees as part of a broader downsizing that will reduce the School's overall staff by 130 people.
In a letter to faculty and staff on June 23, HBS Dean Jay O. Light and Associate Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi said it was a "difficult day" for the School but that there was no alternative.
"Our goal (indeed, our need) has been to prepare the School not just for next year but also for the years after," the letter said. "Ultimately, this means we must become a smaller organization."
Through the latest staff reductions and other cost-cutting initiatives, HBS has trimmed roughly $40 million from its budget, according to HBS spokesman Brian C. Kenny. In their letter, Light and Crispi expressed hopes that no further layoffs would be necessary, but noted that new hiring would be closely monitored.
In a move separate from last week's staff cuts, Harvard Business Publishing has laid off 20 of its 250 employees as well, Kenny said. The School's publishing arm—which prints books, a business journal, and case studies used in HBS classes—has been hit hard by the recession, he said, along with the rest of the industry.
The Business School's financial organization is unique among Harvard's schools. Typically, over 50 percent of the School's revenue comes from publishing and executive education programs. Both will likely generate less income this year, Kenny said.
HBS also drew more heavily from the endowment in fiscal year 2009 than in the past. Its endowment payout, which was $94 million in fiscal year 2008, increased to $115 million in fiscal year 2009, which ended Tuesday.
In addition to the layoffs, 42 out of 103 eligible HBS employees took early retirement incentive packages from the University this past spring—a participation rate of over 40 percent, the highest out of all the University's schools. The letter also noted that roughly 50 temporary and contract workers, mainly in operations and facilities, will not have their contracts renewed for fiscal year 2010—which begins today—and others will leave the school through "normal attrition."
Kenny said the staff cuts were made strategically and that they came mainly from areas that do not directly affect students, such as alumni relations, fundraising, libraries, and IT.
"The guiding principle for the dean and school leadership throughout the year has been that we need to take every measure to preserve the core work of the School—teaching and faculty scholarship," Kenny said.
To further reduce costs, the Business School has limited landscaping operations and closed some dining outlets in its student center. 
In a late April interview, Light said that the School began to respond to the crisis in March 2008 by cutting expenses and postponing several capital projects. But in the recent letter, he and Crispi wrote that it was not enough. Other cost-cutting measures that staff had suggested to avoid layoffs, such as furloughs and pay reductions, would also be too little, they said.
"We have been deeply impressed by the generosity with which these ideas were raised," the letter read. "Unfortunately, though, they are stopgaps rather than measures that would help us achieve sustainable change."
