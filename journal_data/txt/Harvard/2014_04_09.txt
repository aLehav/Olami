After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On Friday, April 4, in the Piper Auditorium of the Graduate School of Design, Michael Murphy (MArch ’11) and Alan Ricks (MArch ’10) presented “Beyond the Building,” a series of short films documenting MASS Design Group’s work over the five years since its founding. Murphy and Ricks discussed the evolution of MASS Design Group, which they established while students at the Design School, into an award-winning, internationally acclaimed organization. MASS Design Group has since expanded their work outside of Rwanda to projects in Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Haiti, and the Congo, to name a few. Their Butaro Ambulatory Cancer Center, the first-ever cancer treatment center to align with the official guidelines of Rwanda, graces the cover of Architect magazine this month.
In grad school, working on their first design project in Rwanda, the pair first began to question the role of architecture in society. “Giancarlo Di Carlo, this late 1970s architect, was and is kind of our hero,” Murphy said. “There was this debate of whether you could have a social practice with political impact or you had a high-design practice. And he called these a false dichotomy, saying it shouldn’t be an either-or, that it should be both.” With this duality in mind, Murphy and Ricks have grown MASS Design Group into an organization that has been praised for its design excellence and its commitment to empowerment of local laborers. ”This intersection of design excellence and societal impact is…where architecture really facilitates a broader discussion of its role in society,” Murphy said.          
A fortuitous encounter at Harvard with Dr. Paul Farmer, co-founder of the global health organization Partners In Health (PIH), would change Murphy and Ricks’s trajectory and push them to think about how their design could have human impact. Farmer mentioned that he was in the process of building homes and a hospital, which caught Murphy’s attention. “I went up to him afterwards and asked him who were the architects involved, could I get involved, maybe make a connection, and he said, ‘Architects? Why would I ever use an architect? I drew the last hospital on a napkin,’” Murphy said. “It’s an interesting challenge. Why would one of the key, leading health professionals in the world, [who] could snap his fingers and get an architect to work for him for free, not think about using architects to design the crucial elements of the infrastructure he was building?” Murphy’s desire to work with Farmer surpassed his need for a generous paycheck, and in 2008 he joined Dr. Farmer and PIH in Rwanda to construct the Butaro District Hospital.
Murphy soon learned from Farmer of an instance where a lack of sound architecture cost lives. In Tugela Ferry, South Africa, an extremely drug-resistant strain of TB spread to 59 patients who stood awaiting treatment in hallways—hallways that lacked proper ventilation, allowing the deadly disease to kill those 59 patients. If buildings could make people sicker, thought the co-founders, how might a building function to improve health instead? “This notion of a performance of the building, this transformation of architecture affecting our lives, was exactly how we were able to compose a series of solutions to this question we were pondering,” Ricks said. 
 The MASS founders knew little about the Rwandan region where they would work, a place so remote that before Dr. Farmer’s arrival, the population of 400,000 was served by not a single doctor. To address these needs, PIH began to develop a multi-building system in partnership with the Rwandan Ministry of Health. “This hospital was to be the kind of flagship of these ideas,” Murphy’s cofounder Alan Ricks said . “So we started to address [the question of] ‘What is a hospital that can respond to these challenges, that doesn’t make us sicker, but might actually make us better?’” Ideas were simple but effective, such as building a hospital with open-air hallways. Yet while single rooms were a good solution to the problem of infection control, the MASS partners learned that isolated patients would be more likely to die, as that room configuration would further stress already-scarce human resources. “Instead, we created these spacious open wards that capitalize on cross-ventilation,” Ricks said. 
Ricks also explained that the goal of MASS Design Group is not only to construct a building that positively impacts lives but to positively impact as many lives as possible during the construction process through on-site job training and the creation of jobs for local labor. “A typical Rwanda wall for us was very interesting, because most of the stone is obscured by cement…. We wanted to see if there was an opportunity to actually highlight the craft over the material. Through that process of engagement with the masons, we really saw an opportunity to expand the [project’s] impact,” Ricks said. “We had them keep pushing, and their skills just continued to get better and better.” The original team of masons for Butaro District Hospital, after working all the way around the building to the corner of the building where they had first begun, had so improved their skills that they asked their foreman if they could “tear down the first one and rebuild so it would match” the improved technique.  
  “We continued to try and push what elements were there [locally] that we could utilize,” Ricks said. But now the Minister of Health wants to turn the Butaro project into the second major teaching hospital in Rwanda, a $100 million investment that would transform a previously remote region into a university campus. As Ricks said, “What started as this one idea about building a better hospital has actually become an entire decade of work.”

Megan G. Murdock ’14 and Jun Shepard ’14 both began dancing at the tender age of three. Now Emerging Choreographers for the Harvard Dance Program, the two will be dancing this week in the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company’s spring production. Before their show, the two sat down with The Crimson to talk performance, school, and life after graduation.
The Harvard Crimson: To start off, let’s have some background. How did you first get into dance?
 
Jun Shepard: I started with creative dance when I was three, which is essentially throwing ribbons around and catching scarves and things. But later on I went to the Alvin Ailey School ; I went to high school at LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts, where I was a dance major—so throughout high school, I thought I was going to pursue dance professionally, and then I came to Harvard!
 
Megan Murdock: I also started when I was three, with Kinder Combo and ballet and tap. I trained at a studio in New Jersey from then, doing ballet and modern and jazz and tap and all of that.
 
THC: How do you feel about the dance scene at Harvard, in terms of both extracurricular and course offerings?
 
JS: Dance at Harvard has become very big.
 
MM: In the last few years especially. We have one or two credit courses in dance each semester through the Dance [Program] or Music Department. But there are also extracurricular classes...and there are all the student groups. I think there’s a very wide range of people who dance, from people who go on to dance professionally to people who just want to take a dance class or perform in a piece—spend two hours a week just moving around. And that’s really exciting, really great. The dance program has expanded a lot in the last few years since we got a new director, Jill Johnson.
 
JS: She’s brought in a lot of really famous, exciting new guest choreographers and master teachers…. They’re kind of like our stars, dance stars, and she just invites them.
 
THC: Speaking of famous dancers, do you have any role models within the dance and choreography world?
 
JS: I feel that every choreographer I’ve worked with has shaped my choreography in some way. It’s really interesting to see how much your choreography changes based on whom you’re working with at that moment.
 
MM: I feel like everybody I’ve worked with has taught me something. Most recently, I got to perform in Dwight Rhoden’s piece with Jun in the Dance [Program] performances last weekend, and that was incredible...to experience his process of creating a new piece and learning from that as a choreographer.
 
THC: Is it a challenge to balance schoolwork and dance?
 
JS: Some may say that my grades have suffered slightly because of my dancing. [Laughs] When performance season is in full swing, we end up in the dance studio at least five hours a day, and that takes a toll both intellectually and physically. It’s difficult because dance requires that amount of time. There is a way to be efficient, but there’s a threshold of efficiency.
 
MM: You have to spend the time doing it. There’s no way around it.
 
JS: That’s why dance needs to be seen more as a varsity sport, where the academic instructors understand that there is a tremendous time commitment to this extracurricular activity that actually plays a huge part in the intellectual development of a student. It’s not just a hobby, really; it’s a continuation of a lifelong process and training.
 
THC: Any idea as to what role dance will play in your future after you graduate?
 
JS: I’m going to Cambridge next year for a Masters’ program in environmental economics, but I’m hoping to...see the choreographic process of various choreographers.
 
MM: I am going to be moving to New York, probably, and dancing professionally—focusing on performance rather than choreography, but maybe eventually choreography will become more of a focus.
 
THC: Are you excited?
 
MM: I am! It’s really scary because you just have to show up and be like, “Take me!” It’s all about connections and knowing other dancers and who’s looking for people to dance for them.
 
JS: But Megan’s going to bring something new to the table. Her dancing is very different from any other dancing I’ve ever seen…. She knows that pure movement doesn’t need to have this strange emotional thing attached to it. You don’t have to be overly emotional to have stage presence. [Many] dancers that I’ve seen have this commercial edge that Megan does not have at all. And it’s really, really refreshing to see that. She’s a pure contemporary modern dancer.

That night, nestled under my electric blanket, I listened to the gurgling stream outside my open window. The Sierra air, drained of its warmth after sunset, smelled of bear clover mixed with the mustiness of my creaky bedroom. I drifted to sleep thinking about childhood summers when the cabin was filled with family and Collin and I shared this room. I remembered snuggling beside him, listening as Dad captivated us with fantasy tales set in the Foxglove cabin and the surrounding woods. I wished that I could have held onto everything that had drifted by in the melted mass of days since those evening stories: countless Sierra summers, grade school and most of high school, our parents’ marriage, and now, poor little Button. Outside, crickets began to chirp—or perhaps they were frogs.
 
A knock on the door shook my muddled consciousness. I sat up and squinted as Collin entered, letting in light from the hallway.
 
“I was sleeping,” I said.
  
“I was thinking,” he said, ignoring me. “Who poisons owls?”
 
“I don’t know.”
 
He began to pace but stumbled over the stack of books I kept next to my bookshelf, a rickety structure crammed with summer novels left at Foxglove over the generations. “This is a mess,” he said, picking up my books and attempting to make room for them on the cluttered shelf.
 
“Did you really wake me to organize my bookshelf?”
 
“No, listen,” he said. “Wait, were you really asleep?”
 
“Kind of.”
 
“So I went to go check up on Aunt Taylor,” he said.
 
“That’s sweet,” I said, guiltily realizing that I should have done the same. She had been understandably distraught over Button’s death.
 
“No, but listen,” he said. “Aunt Taylor thinks it was Royella.”
 
“Why?”
 
“Well, she’s not sure why.”
 
He recounted how he had found Aunt Taylor in her room, quietly staring out the window. When they began to talk about Button, she had become emotional and confessed that she had planned her long stay this summer largely out of concern for Dad but that she never would have come if she thought her dog would be a casualty.
 
Collin began organizing the top bookshelf as he told me that, according to Aunt Taylor, she had run into Royella gambling at Table Mountain. Seeing the pastor’s pious widow at the poker table, whiskey in hand, had made Taylor worry that she was misrepresenting herself to Dad.
 
I recalled our family conversation during Aunt Taylor’s first morning at Foxglove, when Button had found the snake coiled in the old growth oak as we ate breakfast outside. “Didn’t Royella say she did charity work at Table Mountain?” I asked.
 
“Well the thing is, she and the pastor were supposed to be doing some work there,” Collin said. He picked up a dusty hardcover and wiped it with his sleeve. “Taylor says that on the website for their church there’s a link to donate money to build a school for the reservation kids. But that doesn’t explain the gambling.”
 
“But what does that have to do with the owl?”
 
“I don’t know,” he said. “Taylor said she decided she’d better make friends with Royella that day at Table Mountain, you know, for Dad’s sake, to make sure she wasn’t a complete fake. She’s been keeping an eye on her.”
 
“And?”
 
“Well, she seems to have a gambling problem.” He crouched to work on one of the lower shelves. “Taylor doesn’t trust her at all.”
 
“Who knew Royella was secretly edgy?”
 
“I know,” he said. “Maybe she’ll be the cool kind of stepmom after all.” He let out a cynical laugh.
 
When Collin left, shutting the door behind him and shutting out the light from the hall, I listened to his footsteps recede. I fell asleep thinking of the trees too large for Dad’s spray paint, of Royella’s genuine shock when Ranger Cooper announced that spotted owls might be nesting on the property, and of the timber insurance quote addressed to both Royella and Taylor. I again wondered momentarily whether the faint sound I heard outside, largely masked by the bubbling creek, was crickets or frogs.

Powerful. Bizarre. Haunting. These are some of the words that come to mind with Barbara Kruger’s “Untitled (Your Body Is a Battleground.)” The frame crops the image in such a way that the viewer can see only the face of a woman. She stares directly ahead, towards the top—gazing at the viewer. A line starkly cuts through the middle of her symmetrical face: the left is a positive image; the right, a negative one. and the right is a negative production. And perhaps most startlingly, a sentence written in white letters and highlighted in red is superimposed upon the picture in three segments: “Your body is a battleground.”
 
Barbara Kruger, born in 1945, was a full-fledged conceptual artist by 1989 when she created this work. Kruger originally worked as a designer at the fashion magazine “Mademoiselle” and was a picture editor for “House and Garden.” Kruger later defined her own artistic style, using pre-existing images in her art and making them new by pasting words onto the images. In 1989, Kruger created “Untitled (Your Body Is a Battleground)” to be used as a poster for the Women’s March on Washington, which supported a woman’s right to choose.
 
At first, this work seems to divide the reproductive health debate into two sides: those in support of a woman’s right to choose and those against it. The two halves of the image—the negative and the positive rendition—emphasize the twofold nature underlying this issue. However, the words “Your body is a battleground” represent how the fight for choice is different from other political battles. In the case of abortion, the campaign for a woman’s right to choose occurs outside of her body, yet directly affects her. The female body becomes a combat zone that women both struggle for and in. 
 
While “Untitled (Your Body Is a Battleground)” supports the right to choose, the photograph’s history raises more political issues regarding gender. This image is understood by many to be an appropriated image, for at this point in Kruger’s career, she had already immersed herself in merging existing photographs from magazines with texts. Although the exact origin of the image remains unknown, if this image has been appropriated, the viewers are forced to re-examine the work without the text. The figure is a perfected icon of beauty, with a symmetrical face and voluptuous lips. The image's history alludes to a societal fabrication of women.
 
As the stark line divides the figure’s face in half, the viewer’s attention is immediately drawn to the impeccable symmetry of the face; her eyebrows are exactly the same shape, almost as if one is a mirror reflection. The viewers come to read this image as a construct of society, a stereotypical image of how women should appear: she is an object of beauty. In the book “Love for Sale” which survey Kruger’s work and its implications, Kruger is quoted as saying that she bases her work on stereotyping, a “domain as that of ‘figures without bodies.” In this image—a stereotypical depiction of women by society—the woman is no longer an individual. Rather, the depiction of the woman is a product of the society. By adding text, Kruger critiques the circumstances under which this image was originally produced.
 
 
Taking feminine stereotypes into account, the duality of the message becomes even bigger. Because the male gaze turns women into objects, women must fight to be recognized as people. Instead of objectifying her, the viewer becomes conscious of the intense feminist struggle. The positive and the negative are pro-choice and pro-life; women vs. stereotypes; women vs. patriarchal society. According to this work, women must always be on guard. 
 
Barbara Kruger’s “Untitled (Your Body Is a Battleground)” is an aggressive, powerful work of art that compels the viewer to address the struggles that women face. It is especially noteworthy, however, that even though this work was created specifically for the pro-choice Washington rally in 1989, the work manages to shed further light on other gender and social discrepancies through its medium: the alteration of a previously and separately produced image. This image would not have borne such a significant political message without Kruger’s captions. With Kruger’s decontextualization, the image reminds the viewer that these struggles aren’t isolated incidents but ones that women face on a daily basis.

The MC stands on stage with a microphone and squints past the musty yellow light of the Cantab Underground. She begins the poetry slam by giving a short synopsis of the rules of the game: poets perform original work onstage for under three minutes (with a 10-second grace period) while five randomly selected judges in the audience slap numbers on their words so that everyone can go home happy with a numerical label attached to their work. Most people in the room tune out the MC in the beginning because, at least at the Cantab, most of the audience is well-versed in the rules of the game; introducing the competitive art form at the start of each slam is a formality that has become ritual.
 
“Slam poetry was started in 1986 in Chicago by a construction worker looking to breathe new life into performance poetry. His name was Marc Smith—”
 
“SO WHAT?” poets interrupt from all corners of the darkened room as the MC speaks the name of the founder of slam poetry. From then on, there is no more mention of the history of slam—it’s all about sacrificial poets, score creep, and words, words, words.
 
This vocal reaction to the historical context of slam is not unique. I’ve been to slams in Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C., and at the beginning of each, the MC explains the origins of slam only to have the audience interrupt with “SO WHAT?!” when the MC says “Marc Smith.”
 
To a slam newbie, it may seem like don’t want to hear the rest of the story. By yelling over the historical speech, it may feel like we don't care that slam poetry—as we half-hear at the beginning of MC spiels—started as a way to draw poetically-minded people to the same physical location, usually the basement of a bar, the back room of a cafe, or the top floor of a library. The reason poets began to assign numerical scores to poems was to generate enough enthusiasm to pack a room and share in each other’s aestheticized emotional experiences, but it feels like the "SO WHAT!?" separates slam today from slam in the ’80s. Apparently, poets today don't want to spend time thinking about those original spaces. But how is slam different now? Is the original emphasis of gathering poets in one physical space still important to the contemporary slam scene? 
 
These are pretty big questions about the way spoken word has changed over time, and I want to preface my thoughts by emphasizing that I’m just one poet who is comparatively new to the entire art form; what I say here is only a semicolon in the miles of words that have been written and spoken on the topic of performance poetry.
 
The way I see it, most young people’s first encounter with spoken word happens on YouTube. We—the “millennial” kids from middle school to grad school—are the generation of the Internet. We connect more deeply and quickly to people through video blogs, chatrooms, and Facebook than we do to people in everyday interactions. Nowadays, we can most easily access spoken word online. We can sit in bed and click through countless personal stories, watch people we will never meet bare their souls from the comfort of a room where we can close the laptop, move on, and accept the trust that the poet is putting us—all without having to give anything back. Sure, we can “like” a YouTube video, but we don’t have to engage in the art any further than that. We are bypassing the vital act of consent between poet and audience by placing a video camera in between the performer and the receiver. I think that rampantly available YouTube poetry has contributed to a decreased emphasis on the importance of shared space.
 
It's true that it’s harder to get people together in the same place, but the beauty of slam is that you can’t click your way through competitive poetry; you have to be in the same room in order to experience the atmosphere and judge the poems. Despite the lure of YouTube poems, we still need something more substantial, at least I think we do. That's why as MCs at least start to tell the origin story, we have to remember that there is still a reason to brave the T or a freezing bike ride to get to a poetic space. Those first slams in 1986 remind us that it's still important to come together, to slam and listen to each other spit poetry even 30 years after Marc Smith—SO WHAT!?

Peers and parents alike tell students at Harvard and elsewhere that summer internship opportunities at organizations ranging from The New Yorker to the White House are priceless. Unfortunately, more often than not, they are also payless.
 
In recent years, unpaid internships have become more and more popular among college students seeking summer jobs. But on the tails of the surge of popularity has come a matching inundation of complaints. Harvard should respond by ensuring that students in need receive funding for their internship aspirations. Unpaid internships rely on a captive labor market: Companies who deny pay to student members of the workforce contribute to an unfair system centered on exploiting the vulnerable.
 
No student should feel forced to forgo an exciting summer opportunity due to financial concerns, especially not a student at an institution as fully endowed with resources and riches as Harvard. Though Harvard’s Institute of Politics gives 100 lucky students the chance to participate in its Director’s Internship Program every summer, providing its grantees with a $4,000 stipend for their efforts, the vast majority of the student body cannot snag a coveted spot. What’s more, even those fortunate enough to serve as Director’s Interns may only do so for one summer. Come the next, they may feel as down and out as those who never received the stipend in the first place. Harvard’s Office of Career Services offers other sources of funding, but mostly in the international sector, and domestically only when jobs conform to specific criteria.
 
Harvard should engage in a concentrated effort to develop more programs of a similar nature. When it comes to determining which students receive grants, Harvard should look to those who demonstrate financial need.
 
Harvard should change, but more importantly, so should the myriad companies and organizations that recruit students to work for free. When so many students flock to jobs at high-profile organizations, others begin to believe that their resumes will appear sparse and unimpressive should they do anything less highfalutin, dooming their shot at success after graduation. These concerns may be exaggerated, but companies certainly do look to summer experience when hiring permanent employees out of college. As a result, students submit themselves to unjust labor practices, in which workweeks more than 40 hours long do not lead to a single dollar of pay. Students who do take these jobs risk financial distress; others cannot take them at all.
 Harvard, colleges like it, and organizations across the nation should support internships that pay as much in money as they do in intangibles. At a minimum, they should pay enough to make those intangibles—career prospects, experience, networking—accessible to all who deserve them.

As far as I knew for the longest time, politics was my first adult love, dominating lunch table conversations and bar mitzvah decorations, spurning my advances with the cold reality of the faraway voting age.
 
In high school I found the Junior State of America, a movement of like-minded political wunderkinder, made some fine friends, and learned some serious trade secrets: People need to be shepherded, too much critical thinking will get you clobbered, good politicians are usually nothing more than egomaniacal yentas.
 
Disillusioned as I had become, I nevertheless came to Harvard certain that the political scene was where I would make my debut. Too much of a libertine spirit to join either the Democrats or the Republicans, I set up shop at the Institute of Politics, tucked behind clinical glass doors in the central building of the Harvard Kennedy School complex. I mingled with Capitol Hill suits, ran from forum event to forum event, and spent a few years writing and editing international relations journalism at a pretty good publication. For the first time in my life, I was matched on African political obscurities and far outstripped on legislative trivia by everyone in sight.
 
I took seminars on British politics and Nigerian religious conflict, interviewed renowned experts, and collected a list of foreign ministers I’d heard speak. Blessedly, I chose Near Eastern languages and civilizations over government and social studies, but it was a close call. But what I gained in immersion, I lost in new perspective—when I dredged up insights from my jaunts into psychology and artificial intelligence, my immediate peers, convinced that politics’ outer bounds were 18th century philosophy and 20th century economic theory, appeared to be at a loss.
 
In 2010, I once noted to myself that I could never imagine studying either English or computer science—that I was a man made for the middle disciplines, as it were. Post-thesis and post-concentration, I’m reminded by my new freedom of the deep resonance of both poetry and artificial intelligence with my curiosity—and have begun to imagine alternate universes of inspiration and companionship that I passed by, deluded into believing that politicos were the big thinkers among our lot. After swimming for years among acquaintances who sacrificed their talents at the altar of Party X or Party Y (dull authoritarian bands, both of them) or the sclerotic culture of the Beltway, I found politics more foreign than I’d ever known.
 
Since my first brushes with metaphysics in 11th grade philosophy class—the same year I said goodbye to the Abrahamic—I have been consumed by a need to question fundamental assumptions about reality, consciousness, the self, political economy, history, and the like. I doubt that I was born with extreme open-mindedness, but it has become my one and only rallying cry. And for what it’s worth, the team of campus liberals who preach it appear to be no less hidebound than their conservative rivals. Genuine open-mindedness about social paradigms has taken up new residence since the days of Locke and Rousseau—in the worlds of technology, cognitive science, and poetry, I would venture—and has left seekers of understanding in the political realm stranded and ostracized. Had I invested more times in these circles earlier, I imagine I’d be exiting Harvard a much more profoundly changed thinker.
 
This is not to say I have lost everything of my former self: I have spent my last two columns flying the realist banner over Kiev, and I just completed a thesis about—just guess—Israeli political history. I remain musical with difficult questions in international politics because I revel in difficult questions—but I suspect the answers lie in the world of interdisciplinary cross-pollination, most accessible to curious folks well-trained in the quantitative and hard sciences. I once bought into the feel-good canard that what you studied as an undergrad didn’t really matter—but four years later, I have a revision to offer for those coming after me: Study something that teaches you to think in new and unintuitive ways, and immerse yourself in like circles.
 
Ditch gov; challenge yourself with CS.
 
And Arabic can stay, but I’m quite biased.
 Joshua B. Lipson '14, a Crimson editorial writer, is a Near Eastern languages and civilizations concentrator in Winthrop House. His column appears on alternate Wednesdays.

In an interview last August, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked a question at the heart of current politics: “Why should elections be determined by how much a candidate can spend, and why should candidates spend most of their time these days raising the funds so that they will prevail in the next election?” 
Less than a month ago, Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor informed a crowd at the University of Washington that in today’s politics, “what’s talking the loudest is money.” And just last week, the Supreme Court issued a decision in the McCutcheon v. Federal Elections Commission case that will have immediate and insidious implications for the integrity of our democratic system. 
As a result of the court’s ruling, money—more specifically, people with money—will only have greater influence over politicians at the expense of the less wealthy voters who make up the actual majority. Without immediate reform, our system of governance will slowly devolve into a bastardized version of the ideals of the Founding Fathers more comparable with the plutocracy of Carthage. 
Even the most optimistic advocates of campaign finance reform doubted a good result from the same court that decided Citizens United in 2010, which allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts in independent expenditures, inaugurating the boom in spending that we have seen in the last four years.
In fact, the McCutcheon vote, split along the ideological divide, mirrored the result from the infamous 2010 case. If people claim that Citizens United destroyed the fabric of the political system, why should we care that the court just made an already bad situation worse? The answer is quite simple: The limits attempting to prevent egregious political corruption just got substantially weakened. 
Federal law mandates that an individual may not give more than $2,600 to a candidate per election, so the most a person can give directly to a candidate in both the primary and general election is $5,200. Before McCutcheon, an individual could not donate more than $123,200 in a two-year election cycle. Direct contributions were not allowed to exceed $48,600 to candidates and $74,600 to political action committees.
To demonstrate the difference between individual and aggregate limits, it was hypothetically possible to donate $1,000 to 48 different candidates, but illegal to donate to a 49th candidate. Shaun McCutcheon’s basic argument was that he should not be limited in his ability to donate directly to candidates—that these aggregate limits infringed his First Amendment freedom. Sadly, the court agreed. 
Now, in a system where 0.000042 percent of Americans (that’s 132 individuals) gave 60 percent of all super PAC donations spent in 2012, in a system where only 0.08 percent of the population maxed out the individual limit of $2,600 for the election cycle in 2012, in a system where all the 2012 elections cost over $6.2 billion, the court granted limitless contribution. Without the aggregate limit, it is completely feasible that an individual could, through hundreds or thousands of PACs or a party’s joint fundraising committee, contribute $6 million to a single candidate.
We might be at the cusp of political corruption not seen since the Gilded Age of the late 19th century.
Indeed, despite upholding the current individual limits, McCutcheon establishes a frightening precedent. Surely, someone will view the decision and wonder why the system prevents a person from donating more than $2,600 per candidate. According to the logic of the court, that too is an infringement of the right guaranteed by the First Amendment. It is only a matter of time before the Supreme Court delivers another decision deregulating the few lingering fragments of campaign finance law. 
The decision also provides legal justification for increased corrupting influence in state executives and legislatures as well. The Center for Public integrity reports that a minimum of eight and a maximum of 20 states may see their campaign finance regulations overturned depending on the state’s interpretation of the decision. In Massachusetts, the office of Campaign and Political Finance declared that it would “no longer enforce the $12,500 aggregate limit on the amount that an individual may contribute to all candidates.” As the same deep pockets buying national elections increasingly pour their money into state and local races as well, McCutcheon threatens to further weaken the representativeness of our democracy at all levels.
Though McCutcheon is a blow to the movement to end political corruption by getting money out of politics, advocates on Harvard’s campus, in Massachusetts, and throughout the country have not given up. Members of Congress recently introduced two bills—the “Government by the People Act” in the Senate and the “Fair Elections Now Act” in the House of Representatives—both of which would reduce the impact of big money by boosting the role of small-dollar donations. And lawmakers in Massachusetts are pushing for increased disclosure for state elections.
The Harvard College Rootstrikers Association is collecting petition signatures to pressure our representatives to support (or not back down from) these necessary reforms. We are also working with organizations throughout the state and country to re-energize the large-scale movement necessary to correct our broken political system.
Those of us fighting to preserve every citizen’s sacred, equal voice in our democratic process are down but not out. Now is the time to insist on reform, to take our democracy back from a small cadre of big donors and the reckless court that has empowered them. 
We hope you will join us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Adrian Obregon never used to worry about water. The 50-year-old farmer lives in Montaña, an indigenous community in Corrientes, Argentina that lies within the Iberá Wetlands, one of the largest wetlands in the world.
Today, though, enormous pine and eucalyptus plantations, operated by Las Misiones and owned by Harvard’s $32.7 billion endowment, have consumed the groundwater that Adrian’s family previously used for drinking and washing. Adrian told us that he has been forced to deepen his well every year since Harvard bought the plantations, each time spending money he doesn’t have.
Adrian's neighbor Chochón, whose full name has been withheld due to fear of retaliation, said that he was able to buy a water pump on credit, but he’s terrified by the plantations’ proximity. His house was nearly burned to the ground four years ago when the plantations caught fire. He’s afraid he’ll suffocate in another, larger fire someday. The nearest fire department, which consists of four part-time volunteers and a pickup truck, is 20 minutes away.
Adrian and Chochón are just two of thousands of people affected by Las Misiones and EVASA, two timber plantations that we visited on a trip to Argentina last year. From April 5 until April 16, Adrian and Emilio Spataro, another Corrientes resident, are visiting Harvard. For the first time, the Harvard community and administration will be able to hear firsthand from those affected by Harvard’s investments in Argentina.
We know the effects well. Over a year ago, Adrian and Emilio invited us to visit the region after Harvard didn’t respond to their concerns. We went because we knew that research on Harvard's land grabs in Mozambique led to badly needed scrutiny of those investments—and we thought a public spotlight could lead to changes for the better in Argentina.
The extent to which Harvard’s companies mistreat, ignore, and abuse their neighbors was shocking. We saw trucks exiting the plantations driving on the wrong side of the road, making the roads undrivable for locals. Dominga told us about the time she woke up to find strange men building a plantation in her backyard, and Armando told us about the filthy dormitory he lived in for two years on an EVASA plantation. Both of their surnames have also been withheld due to concerns about retaliation.
Although we were the first people from Harvard to be hearing these stories, we vowed not to be the last. And with Adrian and Emilio visiting us until April 16, we know we won’t be the last—hundreds of students are responding to Adrian and Emilio’s call to action.
As Harvard undertakes a $6.5 billion capital campaign, we are reminded that Harvard’s timber plantations exist because of the generosity of alumni donors. There’s only one way to give to Harvard and know that the money will be invested socially and environmentally responsibly—by donating to the Social Alternative Fund, which is managed by an outside investment firm, unlike much of Harvard’s endowment.
We know that Adrian and Emilio’s visit can lead to change because Harvard has changed its investment practices in the past due to student and alumni activism. Following revelations that investments in Chinese oil companies were linked to the genocide in Darfur, Harvard became the first university to divest from the companies in 2005. Last year, after more than 450 donors withheld their money in an escrow account called the Fair Harvard Fund, Harvard created the Social Alternative Fund.
Today, students join with environmentalists and local organizers like Emilio and Adrian in asking Harvard to be a responsible owner of the plantations it directly owns. It shouldn’t expand its plantations but instead should ensure that the plantations comply with all governmental and employment regulations. According to Emilio, Harvard’s plantation managers have not held a public community meeting in Corrientes since 2010—Harvard should tell its managers to re-open dialogue with the community at once.
Everyone on campus should hear the stories of Adrian, Emilio, Chochón, and the thousands of people in Argentina who are being affected by Harvard’s timber plantations. This Friday at 2 p.m., the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition and 10 cosponsoring organizations are holding a rally in Harvard Yard, where Adrian and Emilio will speak about the damage that Harvard’s plantations cause in their communities. We urge students, faculty, and the administration to listen.
Adrian and Emilio are not asking for the impossible; Harvard has direct control over these companies and can obligate them to operate in accordance with the University’s values. By responding to them in completing a comprehensive review of current practices and listening to communities in Corrientes at public forums, Harvard can uphold its commitment to sustainability abroad.
Being a student at Harvard is an incredible privilege. The least we can do is listen to those who are harmed in Harvard’s name, and work to make Harvard a positive force in communities from Cambridge to Corrientes. We have seen the effects of Harvard’s companies on people like Adrian and Chochón firsthand, and we demand that Harvard do better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Four members of the Class of 2014 have been chosen to take the stage at the annual Class Day celebration, the Senior Class Committee announced Tuesday night.
Adam J. Conner ’14, a former Crimson business editor, and Christy L. Disilvestro ’14 will present the reflective Harvard Orations, and Zack W. Guzman ’14 and Jenna D. Martin ’14 will deliver the witty Ivy Orations.
Ginny C. Fahs ’14, a former Crimson magazine editor and member of the Senior Class Committee, said the Committee reviewed a record number of submissions to this year’s competition before selecting the four finalists. She added that the Committee sought to find student speakers who could speak to the shared Harvard experience, as well as their personal stories.
Speakers uniformly described feelings of excitement upon word of receiving the honor.
“I was overjoyed when I got the news,” Conner said. “Like any other ideal Harvard orator, I was sitting in the back of the Kong when I found out.”
The four students said they plan to explore a variety of themes in their speeches—ranging from fears of graduating to the changes in one’s identity throughout college.
Guzman said that, although he knew he wanted to submit a speech, he was unsure what topic to choose until this Valentine’s Day.
“I wrote [my speech] when I was reflecting on what loves I had in my life,” he said. “And Harvard was the love of my life.”
Disilvestro described the pressure of delivering a speech that resonates with the diverse members of the Class Day audience.
“Being able to speak to that many people and have a message that might reach each of them is really exciting for me,” she said.
Martin said the uploading of videos of students’ orations online places an additional burden on student speakers.
“I feel like Ivy Orators before Youtube don’t know how easy they had it,” she said.
The speakers also expressed their excitement for Class Day.
“There’s rarely a time where you feel happy and sentimental and like a real community, but you’re also laughing,” Martin said of Class Day.
Citing the Facebook campaign used to attract submissions to the competition, entitled “A Once in a Lifetime View,” Guzman said that he is looking forward to the view from the podium.
Committee member Maria Barragan-Santana ’14 said she feels that hearing the Class Day speeches has helped her cope with the imminent arrival of Commencement.
“Being on the Committee, you’re planning ‘the end’ all the time,” she said. “I think, after having listened to all the speeches, we’re going to be okay.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With senior midfielder Gabriel Mendola earning athlete of the week honors after going 20 for 26 on faceoffs to continuously keep Harvard men’s lacrosse in possession in the Crimson’s 14-9 win over No. 2 Cornell, here are the runners-up.
Will Walker, Men’s Lacrosse
Sophomore attackman Will Walker scored four goals and tallied one assist in the Crimson’s road win over Cornell to continue hit hot streak. Walker has scored four or more goals in three straight games and has carried the offensive load for Harvard all season as he now has 26 on the year.
Audrey Todd, Women’s Lacrosse
Sophomore midfielder Audrey Todd was all over the field for the Crimson last Wednesday as she tallied three goals, an assist, and three ground balls to help Harvard to its 12-8 victory over Vanderbilt. Against Brown on Saturday, Todd once again earned a hat trick and finished with four goals, equaling the final tally for Brown as the Crimson came out on top, 10-4.
Nick Madden, Men’s Volleyball
The senior opposite hitter had 11 kills in Friday’s loss to No. 12 Penn State and followed it up with 13 kills in Saturday’s 3-1 win over Saint Francis on senior night. The co-captain now has 825 kills in his Crimson career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has had a varsity men’s lacrosse team for over a century, while Boston University has had one for under a year.
Harvard (7-4, 3-0 Ivy) is coming off one of the biggest wins in the history of its program over No. 2 Cornell, while BU (1-10, 1-5 Patriot) lost a devastating win to a talented Army team by just one goal.
When the two teams met in Cambridge on Tuesday, it was about as close as the Terriers could have hoped it would be.
“BU came out ready to play from the start,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “I was overall disappointed in our approach and how we came out a little undisciplined.”
FOR THE SENIORS
The Crimson started the game by featuring every member of its senior class in what Wojcik essentially treated as a senior night.
“We wanted to honor our senior class,” Wojcik said. “They’ve given this program four years of hard work, dedication, and commitment. It is a special honor to start the game, and I wanted to give all the seniors that chance at least once.”
Harvard has one more home matchup this season, but that comes in a must-win game against Princeton that is likely to be close throughout. Playing against a first-year program allowed Wojcik to have an entire starting lineup of seniors, other than junior goalkeeper Jake Gambitsky.
In order to do this, however, senior midfielder Pat Fiorvanti was forced to start as a shortstick defenseman, as there are only two senior defensemen on the Crimson’s roster.
BU secured the opening faceoff and was able to leverage the mismatch that this lineup created to generate an open look from about eight yards out. Luckily for Harvard, the shot soared high.
However, after regaining the ball on the restart of play, Terrier rookie attackman Ryan Johnston was able to score to put his team on top early in the game. Sophomore defenseman Stephen Jahelka, the Crimson’s usual starter, was then substituted into the game as the third longstick defenseman, and Harvard quickly took the lead.
TURNOVER CITY
As a result of effectively a superior level of talent, the Crimson played aggressively throughout the contest. All over the field, Harvard players were pressing out defensively or during attempted BU clears and challenging their opponents, looking to force quick turnovers.
They were quite successful in this endeavor, as the Terriers wound up with 26 turnovers, the highest of any of the Crimson’s opponents this season.
“We are athletic on defense,” Wojcik said. “We were aggressive, but sometimes we tried to do a little too much defensively.”
Likely as a result of the team’s aggressive play, Harvard committed a large number of penalties throughout the game. The Crimson gave up a total of nine penalties, four of which BU managed to capitalize on.
WHAT’S COMING NEXT
In some ways, this game against the Terriers was a warm-up for Harvard as the team prepares to enter an enormously challenging finish to the schedule. With last week’s upset win over Cornell, the Crimson has gained sole possession of the lead of the Ivy League, and needs only one win in its last three games to clinch an appearance in the conference tournament. The Ancient Eight champion will receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
“Obviously our goal is always to win the Ivy Championship,” Wojcik said. “But we don’t look at the big picture. If we did that, we’d be taking a step backwards. Our focus is going to be on being better tomorrow.”
But winning one of those three games will be no easy feat.
“As a group, we’re still building towards playing a complete game,” said Harvard captain and senior midfielder Peter Schwartz. “We need to have the maturity to come off a big win like last week and play our best lacrosse.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not have been pretty, but the Harvard men’s lacrosse team earned its second consecutive win on Tuesday night. The Crimson (7-4, 3-0 Ivy), which has yet to drop a home game this season, faced the new Boston University program (1-10, 1-5 Patriot) at Harvard Stadium, defeating the Terriers 14-9. The two Beantown area teams sported One Fund socks in honor of the victims of last year’s Boston Marathon bombings.
The Harvard squad dropped the first goal of the game as the Terriers scrapped their way past the Crimson defensemen and to the net early in the opening quarter.
“We came out sloppy and not all there offensively early,” Harvard coach Chris Wocjik ’96 said. “We just didn’t do the thing that we’ve been doing consistently over the past few weeks.”
The Terriers were unable to hold onto the lead for long, as co-captain Peter Schwartz caught a smooth pass from sophomore Sean Mahon, and propelled the ball past BU’s second-string rookie goalie, Tyler Zickel. The Crimson did not trail the Terriers again in the night, though Zickel was able to tally nine saves in his debut collegiate game.
“Our ball movement wasn’t where it has been this season,” Wocjik said. “[We were] being selfish.”
A record high eight of Harvard’s 14 goals were unassisted on the night. Schwartz ended the match with five points and led the team with two assists. Though nine Crimson players found the back of the net, leading sophomore point holders Will Walker and Deke Burns had relatively quiet games.
Walker, who has scored 29 goals coming into the night’s competition, notched three goals in the first half but was silenced by the Terriers in the second section of play. Meanwhile Burns, who entered the match with 11 goals and five assists on the season, found the back of the net once and doled out one assist.
“All of our guys played well at times,” Wocjik said. “I wouldn’t really say one guy stood out over the rest. But I think every guy we had made good plays, but I just don’t think it was all there for 60 minutes.”
The game was defined by penalties and turnovers. BU, which averaged 19 turnovers a game prior to facing up against Harvard, totaled 26 botched opportunities, while the Crimson coughed the ball up 17 times.
“We definitely didn’t play our best game,” co-captain Joe Petrucci said. “We were in the box the whole game. It’s tough to get a rhythm on offense when you’re getting so many penalties.”
Harvard accumulated nine penalties throughout the four periods for crosschecking, tripping, holding, slashing, and delay of game.
“We didn’t change our game plan at all,” Petrucci said. “That’s just the way we play. We are aggressive; we’re scrappy of the ground. We battle on ground balls, and we take pride in working harder than the other team. We didn’t do anything differently. But we were man down a lot, but you can’t really blame it on the refs, it’s the way they were calling the game and we should’ve adapted to that.”
The Terriers were able to capitalize on their man-up opportunities four times, keeping BU in the game until the final whistle. The visitors received just three penalties, giving the Crimson two advantage points.
Though the match was not Harvard’s best, especially coming off last Saturday’s victory against formerly-undefeated Cornell, the Crimson success marks the team’s fourth win at home, keeping the squad undefeated in Cambridge.
“This year we haven’t had that many home games,” Schwartz said. “So it makes each win a little more special, especially for us as a senior class because we know that our games here are limited. But playing here at night is really special, and we love playing in front of the home crowd.”
Tuesday’s game was the first time Harvard squared off against the Terriers as a varsity team. The last meeting between the two squads—then competing as club programs—was in 1934.
“I think it’s great for the sport that BU has added a program,” Wojcik said. “This is one area of the country that the sport is growing as fast as anywhere. We have been the only Division I program in 45 miles, and so to now have another school step up and create a program is great for the sport. I hope to see other schools in the area do it.”

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
Some campus art at the University of Pennsylvania might even make the sculptures in the Science Center seem beautiful. A 50-foot welded steel statue entitled “Covenant,” by Alexander Lieberman, was installed on the UPenn campus in 1975, and has since been affectionately dubbed as the Dueling Tampons in reference to its resemblance to quarreling menstrual fluid receptacles. Though now considered iconic, mixed opinions abound on the statue’s artistic merits, as many students find it “gross,” “hideous,” “obnoxiously spastic”, and “terrible and ostentatious.” Unfortunately, someone had a strong enough opinion to deface the statue this past weekend with black spray paint. We can only hope that in the future this disrespectful tagger will control their PMS.
 
Besides winning football games, it looks like there is something else Yalies can’t seem to manage: feeding themselves. Not to worry, since Yale Dining services is offering a three-workshop series called Reality Bites to educate graduating seniors on how to, well, live in the real world where hot meals aren’t served on a buffet line three times a day. In the first workshop, “Etiquette and Wine Pairing,” students learned important things like which fork to use and why champagne is an “aperitif.” If reality bites, it doesn’t bite that hard, considering that the workshop kickoff meal featured a four-course spread of “classic consommé, chicken breast with smoked gouda and sun-dried tomato, and opera torte with elderberry flower mousse.” Pinkies out, everyone.
 
While Harvard students can be secure in the knowledge that the median grade at the College is an A-, at Columbia students may have to look around harder to find easy-A courses. In March, Columbia sophomore Daniel Liss came to the rescue by creating the website gradesatcu.com, while compiles student-submitted A-range transcript data to list which classes have the easiest and hardest grading curves. According to an infographic in the Columbia Spectator, the Core Curriculum class with the highest percentage of grades in the A-range in the 2010-2011 year was Music Humanities, with 77% receiving A grades. Science courses received the lowest percentage, with 45% in the A-range. Rough. 
 And while we in Cambridge usually assess house accommodations based on room size, distance from the Yard, and lack of cockroaches, it seems that Brown students have a different metric: conduciveness to sexual activity. In a post on the Blog Daily Herald, Brown student Monica Bruinsky offers a thorough critique of which dorms have central location for voyeurism, thin floors for audial exhibitionism, eight floors for elevator sexy-time, and private in-suite bathrooms for shower smooching. Mather might have more sex, and Adams might have better sex, but it seems that Brown wins for most variety.

 The weather is finally hitting 60 degrees, just in time for Yardfest! Since this year's artist is super fun to dance to and is less controversial than last year's headliner, it’ll be a great time to get outside, have fun, and dance badly to music you may or may not know. Homework can wait and the latest episode of Game of Thrones will always be on HBO GO, but YOYO—You Only Yardfest Once (or four times, but you get the idea). For those who are unsure how to get the best out of that Sunday, here are some tips!
Get the party started earlyYardfest starts at 5:00 p.m. (or 5:07 p.m. on Harvard time), so there's plenty of prime day drinking time beforehand. Get some friends, hang out, practice singing Janelle Monae off key after indulging in creatively named drinks or the cans of tepid PBR you have hidden underneath your bed. Don’t get too drunk though, the bands are harder to enjoy from UHS.
Try to reserve a spaceHundreds of people attended Yardfest last year, so it may not be easy to find a prime spot to awkwardly sway to the music. Head over to the Yard early to secure a spot as close to the stage as possible.
Get a free t-shirt 
The best thing about Harvard, other than its great classes, is the opportunity for the students to get a lot of free stuff. Many people go to the many events on campus only so they can grab free swag. Yardfest is no different, and this year's tshirt is pretty awesome!  You might not remember much of the event, so it’s great to have a souvenir of the awesome time you had. For the vertically challenged, befriend a tall person and use his or her long arms to snatch you a couple.
 
Get your work done beforehandCollege students are known for doing all of their work last minute. Harvard students are no different, especially when it comes to their psets, papers, and taxes. Get your work done. Janelle Monae probably sounds worse filtered through the windows of Lamont Café.
