After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thesis writer? J-term was supposed to provide a time for in-depth research and writing on campus, right? Well, with that guarantee snatched away faster than weekday scrambled eggs, we have recently discovered a possible loophole for you. Read on, future tax evader.
As you have probably heard ad nauseam over the past year, the Chinese character for crisis may have something to do with opportunity also. As a Harvard student, this is probably not surprising—you have always known how to step on others when they are down in order to accomplish your own goals. You might even say, as the world’s best and brightest, you are like a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming your blood funnel into anything that smells like it might affect your GPA.
While this is true, the economic crisis for many of you has until now really only served to worsen your life—specifically those of you who tried microwaving your cereal this morning and those of you who “chose” to apply to law school. Many of you, however, might have missed a particularly appealing opportunity that is just now becoming apparent. For, as they say in New Haven: In the shadow of a crisis, there are many other crises waiting.
Indeed, the looming H1N1 crisis right around the corner has possibly surpassed the scariness of our budget crisis. Whereas e-mails reflecting our budget crisis alert us to the discontinuance of our personal course guides, the regular H1N1 updates seem to threaten the very functioning of our university.
According to The Crimson, “Harvard University Health Services has identified 38 unoccupied dorm rooms throughout the House system to isolate students who have the H1N1 ‘swine’ flu and do not have single bedrooms.” Isolate? Yes, these isolation chambers—as we’ve termed them—are a frightening concept. But maybe not so much once you start applying that famous Harvard egotism.
That’s right, maybe H1N1 is your free ticket into J-term housing. Just imagine finishing your thesis in an air-locked chamber with no distractions but your own vomiting.
So go ahead: play that fourth game of beer pong. Ignore those handy tips in the dining hall telling you to use a clean plate each time you get seconds—the administration is just trying to trick you into not getting swine flu. Did you know that H1N1 rooms come with full room service? Maybe next time you’ll think twice before stopping at the Purell dispenser. Rumor has it that isolation chambers might even receive the occasional hot breakfast.
Getting tired of your blockmates? The isolation chambers are doubles, so a myriad of social opportunities lie in store for you. Think of the friendships you’ll form in an H1N1 chamber. Your new roommate will have been handpicked for his or her common interests in digital thermometers, masks, tissues, and so much more.
With such a compelling package, we are concerned that 38 chambers won’t be nearly enough. And as soon as word gets out that registered isolation chamber parties are for H1N1 students only, the rush will be on to catch the virus. Though freshmen trying to crash the masked gatherings will inevitably leave frustrated when asked by certified FLU teams to flash their temperatures first. 
So good luck, fellow flu chasers. And please note: This offer is available for a limited time only and comes with zero guarantee that you will be not be placed in the Quad.

Just last year alone, 872 students enrolled in Professor Michael Sandel’s legendary course, Moral Reasoning 22: “Justice.” But now that Harvard’s most popular class has been made into a public television series of 12 episodes on WGBH, there’s no telling how much larger its “enrollment” will be this season. And while the introduction of the new show “Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?” makes it easier to get a more comfortable seat and a better view of Sandel, it is also an admirable continuation of Harvard’s commitment to its Extension School programs and to sharing its academic resources with the larger community. 
Most of the “Justice” lectures have already been available online for some time, through its own website or through other Harvard Extension School portals. The creation of the television series was a natural decision for a course that has been so popular for so long among both current Harvard students and alumni. 
Indeed, the selection of “Justice” as the Harvard class to broadcast to the world in this fashion was a good one, for its material is more than just interesting or engaging. Drawing on thinkers from Aristotle to John Rawls, the course has the potential to be a formative experience, one in which viewers will undoubtedly be forced to reflect on important moral questions and decide for themselves where exactly they stand. Though surely not the only venue for such important debates, a course as relevant as “Justice” that appeals to so many is an apt choice, and many viewers will benefit from its presence on the airwaves. 
While the television show will naturally reach a much larger audience than the course ever has, we hope that this extension of information beyond Harvard also takes place on the Internet and in other media forms other than television. To that end, it is encouraging to see that the show’s website already includes interactive online content that will enable viewers to participate more actively in the debates they encounter on the show. Each episode features discussion guides at beginner and advanced levels; there are also pop quizzes, discussion circles, and downloadable versions of the readings. 
But the best thing about this new television program is that, with it, Harvard has shared some of its incredible academic resources with the rest of the world and has invited the public to join its unique academic community. Just as “Justice” itself urges students to reconsider their beliefs and approaches to action, it is good to see Harvard open its long-closed gates in dialogue with the local and national communities.

On Monday, the Obama administration announced plans to provide the more than 600 detainees at the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan with increased legal rights. Each detainee is to be assigned an American military official who, while not a lawyer, would be responsible for gathering evidence and witnesses on behalf of the detainee and present his case before a military review board. 
This is the latest move in a series of adjustments by the current administration as it reviews the detention policies of the previous administration. Already, the administration has announced its attention to close the current prison facilities at Bagram, to have them replaced by a newer, more humane complex, and to inform the International Committee of the Red Cross of the identities of the detainees being held.
However, while we endorse these changes in policy as a step in the right direction toward providing suspected enemy combatants their legal rights as dictated by the Geneva Conventions, we see the current slate of measures as insufficient and hope that they presage more actions in the near future. Much remains to be done to see that all those detained by the United States are provided with due process of the law.
As Tina Monshipour Foster, executive director of the International Justice Network, pointed out to the Inter Press Service, “The ‘new’ procedures adopted by the Obama administration are not new at all; they appear to be exactly the same as the procedures created by the [George W.] Bush administration in response to prior court challenges by Guantanamo detainees.”
Foster went on to call out the policy’s failure to provide detainees with access to lawyers. We second her concern—this omission detracts from the legitimacy of any review process that will take place.  As Western State University law professor David Frakt, a former Guantanamo defense counsel, complained about the administrations’ failure to grant detainees access to valid legal representation, “It is simply unrealistic to expect non-lawyers to zealously advocate on behalf of the detainees, or to be effective in gathering witnesses and evidence to challenge the lawfulness of the detention.”
We urge President Obama and Pentagon officials to heed the complaints of Foster, Frakt, and other human-rights advocates and expand the rights of those being held at Bagram, lest this Afghan prison come to be seen by the international community as the new Guantanamo.
It is insufficient to simply label detainees “enemy combatants” and forget about issues of their legal status—in an conflict of undeterminable length such as the War on Terror, this is tantamount to renouncing all of a prisoner’s rights.
Our commitment to establishing a stable Afghan state and squelching the resurgent Taliban makes it critical for the United States to win the support of the Afghan people, and should the human rights violations at Bagram—some of whose denizens have been held there for over six years and two of whom were killed in 2002 due to beatings by American soldiers—persist, it would be counterproductive to this effort and to America’s moral status in the world.

Last week, excitement over a spate of good weather was tempered by the announcement that, in the last fiscal year, Harvard’s endowment plunged 27.3 percent. Its total value fell approximately $11 billion to $26 billion, a loss greater than the total endowments of all but three other universities in the country. This sobering news highlights the fact that some mistakes were made in Harvard’s investment strategies, prompting a need to reconsider the way we manage our money.
Given Harvard’s financial needs and unique situation as a university, we do not need excessively volatile or risky investment approaches. As long as superlative students keep banging down the doors of admissions, the university’s flow of donations will not dry up. Therefore, we do not have the same need for blockbuster quarterly earnings, as a corporation does, and there is little reason we should financially aim as such. Harvard’s priority should be providing a reliable, quality educational and research experience during any given year. Consequently, Harvard Management Company, which oversees the investment of our endowment, should focus on steady, consistent growth, for safety rather than surprise.
That said, it would be naive to move into an overly conservative strategy in the wake of the losses of the past year. HMC managers were extraordinarily successful before 2008, and one bad year should not collapse our faith in their investment acumen. In the 10-year period ending in fiscal year 2008, the Harvard endowment outperformed the median institutional fund by 7.7 percent per year. Had it earned the median institutional fund rate, endowment assets would have been $23.5 billion less. Moreover, Harvard’s money czars are far from alone in their shortcomings this year. Yale’s endowment fell 30 percent in the past fiscal year.
Therefore, although there are lessons to be learned going forward, calls to drastically scale back risk-taking in the future are unfounded. This would prevent Harvard from recovering from its current dire straits and stunt our growth prospects. HMC should instead look to manage money mindfully, attaining good enough returns given the university’s particular situation. This is our best hope to seeing the endowment recover and making the budget cuts of the past year a distant memory.

She’s supermodeled, posed nude, and criticized the Pope; her albums of breathy pop have sold thousands of copies; ex-lovers include Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, and a former prime minister. Carla Bruni, France’s smoky-eyed first lady, is certainly no cookie-cutter politician’s wife. Rather than act the invisible accomplice to her husband’s efforts, Bruni’s refusal to paper over her colorful past and insistence on taking on ambitious social projects in the present have made her the scandal du jour around many a wine cooler. Yet poll results suggest the tides are turning. Bruni’s insistence on maintaining her self-identity has grudgingly won over the nation’s citizens—90 percent now deem her “elegant and modern.”
Hence the cognitive dissonance at hearing a clip from Bruni’s song “Quelqu’un m’a dit” accompanying a scene in the recently released “(500) Days of Summer.” The movie, a fluffy Joseph Gordon-Levitt vehicle, takes off from an interesting premise: A pretty female protagonist rejects the labels of a straightforward relationship. For all its pretenses at innovation in the form of jump-cuts and non-linear narrative, though, the final product makes no attempt at exploring the motivations behind that stance at all. The inner struggles through which the main character, or women like Bruni, must have suffered to achieve their levels of self-assuredness remain opaque; the movie in which Bruni’s track plays ultimately serves to subvert her own successes.
“(500) Days of Summer” is essentially a chick flick, and it may be unfair to approach it expecting anything like depth. But the idea of looking for an articulate female self-consciousness in the movies isn’t irrational. Indeed, it’s in cinema—a very 20th-century development—that many of the most nuanced, sensitive portrayals of women over the last century can be found. The medium offers a liberating escape from the tired mini-skirt/power-suit dilemma over how to represent oneself outwardly as a woman. A film can instead represent a woman’s interiority, combining effects in ways that literature or a painting cannot.
Take a shot of a woman walking down a street: We hear the click of her heels, see men’s heads turn, and at the same time know through her facial expression or a voiceover what’s going through her mind. Films like Yasujirõ Ozu’s Noriko trilogy of the ’40s, New Wave features starring Monica Vitti and Anna Karina, or the defiant ’80s flick “Thelma and Louise” prove that it’s possible to represent the inner life of a woman with complexity and grace. Gazing at her reflection in the window of a Chinese restaurant, the protagonist of Agnès Varda’s 1962 film “Cléo de 5 à 7” despairs: “My unchanging doll’s face… this ridiculous hat… I can’t see my own fears. I thought everyone looked at me. I only look at myself. It wears me out.” It’s the poignancy of this visual, combined with Cléo’s private anxiety over her own youthful good looks, that makes her so real to the audience she’ll never see.
That’s what makes certain aspects of the last decade of moviemaking seem so disappointing. With a few exceptions, attempts at depicting the interior life of a woman have been put on the backburner. Nouvelle gamine figures like “Amélie” star Audrey Tautou tap into the rich inheritance of the ’60s and ’70s but retain all the cuteness without the introspection. Those recent films that do present well-defined female characters—“Whale Rider,” “Thirteen,” “Juno”—generally center on adolescence, a morass of complexities that tends to subsume any secondary themes. Once they graduate high school, women tend to disappear from the screen in any meaningful way entirely, fading away as stock types, or arm candy, or background characters.
True, the work of a crop of female directors at this year’s Toronto Film Festival leaves the door open for progress (even if the event was exceptional enough to merit a New York Times article). But it’s time for America to take up the slack, too. The writer Bill Bryson once compared Canada to a sophisticated, black-turtleneck-clad woman in her mid-30s and America to a chubby preteen boy. Though he was being flippant, there’s a kernel of truth to that generalization. In America, 90 percent of directors are male—not an inherent disqualification for trying to understand the mental processes of women, but an added complication to moving beyond the crash-bang pictures that fill our cineplexes today.
In the political sphere, women like the French first lady are still forced into a position of defiance rather than productive reflection. Multi-faceted artistic representations of the female mind—in film, on TV, in books—may be just what’s needed to help spur a conceptual shift in the way we think about how women think. After all, the issue is not just about how to make an interesting movie. It’s about how a society represents half of its population to itself.

With the report last week of a 27.3 percent drop in the university’s endowment, the Harvard community now knows the true magnitude of the impact the global economic crisis is having on our operations. Here and across the country, university officials are adapting to a “new normal baseline” of funding. But precisely what does that mean to us when Harvard’s apparent baseline is still $26 billion? 
As the person charged with overseeing the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and its budget, people often ask me: “Sure, Harvard and the FAS have lost a lot of their endowment, but you still have tens of billions of dollars. Can’t you spend more of it now to avoid making difficult or painful budget cuts?”
The simple answer is that we are spending more this year from the endowment, more than we ever have previously, to smooth the transition to this new normal. But if we want Harvard to remain Harvard, we cannot do that for long, for every dollar of endowment we spend is a dollar that cannot generate income in the future. 
The description of the endowment can be a confusing one, because many people see it as something that it is not—a savings account, a rainy-day fund, a fully usable financial umbrella for the kind of economic deluge in which we now find ourselves. But it is not that at all: The money in the endowment is investment capital. It is money that creates a revenue stream just as tuition and research funding are revenue streams. 
Fortunately, on the same day that Harvard Management Company publicly reported the university’s endowment losses—the first such loss since 2002 and only the fifth reported loss since 1971—another equally unique event occurred to remind me of the endowment’s true role. That afternoon, hundreds of students, faculty, and staff witnessed a cow grazing in Harvard Yard for the first time in living memory. 
Harvey Cox, who recently retired as the Hollis Professor of Divinity, the oldest endowed chair in America, decided to exercise the traditional grazing rights that originally came with that position. As I watched Professor Cox and the Jersey cow named Faith reenact this venerable, and now slightly amusing, tradition from a window in University Hall, it seemed that he had provided the perfect metaphor for the purpose of the endowment.
The endowment is like a herd of dairy cows, grazing just like Faith in Harvard Yard. Each day we milk the cows and sell the milk to help pay the bills of Harvard College.
Sometimes the milk we sell brings in more money than our current bills. This allows us to buy more cows and, on the expectation that we’ll be able to sell more milk, increase our annual expenses by launching new programs, constructing new buildings, or hiring new faculty.
At other times, the milk we sell brings in less money than our current bills. To pay our bills, we have to sell some of our cows. But we must be very cautious how we thin the herd, because selling cows to fund current expenses means that we will have less milk to sell next year and less money to fund future expenses. If we don’t plan carefully, we will have to sell even more cows at the end of next year, or begin to cut our future expenses.
In this fictional world, the global financial crisis that affected Harvard and all of us last fall is a disease that killed off 27.3 percent of our herd. Looking to the future, we know the remaining cows will not produce enough milk to pay our bills.
In the real world, the financial crisis has depleted the value of the endowment, leaving us with less income to fund operations this year and for years to come. So what’s the answer? As I mentioned, one answer is to spend more from the endowment—to thin the herd—so that we can bridge the gap between annual income and annual expenses. 
But as my analogy demonstrates, spending down the endowment too far (selling too many cows) leaves us with too little money to sustain our operations in the future. Like a farmer with too few cows to sustain his farm, spending too much from our endowment can exacerbate the problem of too little operating cash, making more budget cuts necessary in the future.
I am proud about the way the FAS community came together these past six months and thought carefully about the difficult balance that needed to be struck between continued spending to support our core mission today and thoughtful budget cuts to ensure that Harvard remained Harvard in the future. By having made difficult choices and by husbanding our financial resources early, we acknowledged the needs of both our current students and the future generations of students yet to matriculate. The process has also produced ideas that will make Harvard stronger and better prepared to tackle the challenges and embrace opportunities of the 21st century.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unpacking my boxes from summer storage, I began to suspect that I was suffering from a severe case of mauvaise foi. Perhaps it was a symptom of the anxiety surrounding my recent 20th birthday or my more deep-seated tendency toward hypochondria, brought on by watching too many episodes of “Grey’s Anatomy.” Yet, as I unearthed heart-shaped perfume bottles, caked tubes of mascara, and back issues of Vogue, I felt as though I had violated some ill-defined feminist responsibility. A twinge of guilt, beyond the purely financial, accompanied my purchase of a new flower-printed dress; a strange uneasiness followed my Google search for “grapefruit diet.” Was my allegiance to the accoutrements of pink-packaged femininity a violation of my political commitment to feminism? And what was the alternative—not shaving my armpits, wearing board shorts, eschewing Diet Coke for beer?
Feminism is a frustratingly ambivalent movement, unclear as to exactly what it requires from those who self-identify as members. Its relationship with femininity—those mysterious qualities that characterize the female sex—is even more ambivalent. Apologetic qualifications (“I’m a feminist, but…”) are frequently invoked by young women, who associate the doctrine with the overly serious, overly desexualized, and inadequately shaven activists of the ’60s and ’70s. Even those girded with feminist theory, and fully aware of the dangers of the feminine mystique, have refused to relinquish their fidelity to the heterosexual culture of beauty—myself included.
Attempts by feminists to chastise other women for failing to assume a suitably feminist outlook have by and large failed. Take, for example, Naomi Wolf, author of “The Beauty Myth.” The phrase describes the idealized standard of beauty whose realization is upheld in Western culture as the end-all task of being female. Yet, despite the myth’s devastating implications—self-loathing, eating disorders, bodily mutilation via plastic surgery—no woman wants to be patronized into giving up eyeliner and lipstick. Nor does she want to be told that her low-cut blouse shows that she’s been hoodwinked into a patriarchal conspiracy intended to keep her perpetually insecure, perpetually plucking, and, therein, perpetually tame.
 Granted, Wolf’s militant excoriations have significant cultural resonance, even to women who aren’t convinced that their stilettos mean they’ve done something wrong. Despite our society’s emphatic assertion that an objective standard of beauty exists, the concept is actually grounded in female inadequacy. Regardless of how many hours, dollars, and brain cells women spend, there will always be an un-pluckable hair, an un-erasable wrinkle, and an un-toneable ounce of cellulite to eliminate. The pursuit of beauty is eminently frustrating (and eminently profitable) for the very reason that it can never be successfully realized. Feminism, on the other hand, aims to vitiate this notion of female inadequacy by demanding gender equality in both the public and private spheres.
Feminism and femininity thus appear to stand dogmatically opposed. As women, the line between doing things to feel better about ourselves and doing them to become more sexually attractive to men is tenuous. Using the rationale “I did it for myself” to justify breast augmentation rings of self-deception, yet for more subtle procedures and regimens, who can be the judge? 
Deciding where Wolf’s beauty myth stops and where inconsequential delight in aesthetic products begins has dominated feminist debates for decades. One proposed solution, advanced by the so-called “girlie” feminists, is for women to reappropriate traditional models of femininity in much the same manner as gays reclaimed the term “queer” and blacks reclaimed the term “nigger.” According to this movement, almost any choice that a woman makes—from exposing her midriff to getting off on camera—can be empowering, provided that it is executed in a sufficiently fierce manner. Women are invited to make themselves sexual objects, to ironically assume the male gaze in an effort to be insiders rather than aloof and prudish victims.
Questioning your intentions every time you shave your armpits is exhausting. But “girlie” feminism does not advance a viable solution, nor does it assuage females’ anxieties about the authenticity of their efforts at self-improvement. Voluntarily choosing to objectify oneself may feel like empowerment. Yet such empowerment is ephemeral, given the inability of the female subject to control others’ interpretations of her choices. Brashly assuming traditional feminine tropes is no more productive than brashly assuming masculine ones: the taboo of the hairy-legged, power-suit-wearing, man-hating feminist from which “girlie” feminists so hope to distance themselves. The term “girlie” is itself problematic: It evokes “girlhood”—a juvenile, enervated version of femininity, in contrast to the maturity and power of “womanhood.” 
Feminism is too conflicted, and too confused, to tell me whether I should feel guilty for still owning a tube top. Perhaps this is a good thing: After all, doing what one is told, rather than assuming the agency to decide for oneself, goes against feminism and its existentialist ethics. Perhaps remaining conscious of the debate and begging the question is the best that I can do.

The Common Spaces Steering Committee started with two Chairs—Dean Mostafavi and Professor Cohen—and somehow ended up with 476. In a university that prides itself on aesthetic preservation over centuries, this explosion of pastel has caused quite a sensation. The medley of eye-catching metal is the newest thing on campus since wireless Internet and Radcliffe girls, and, as with these predecessors, I am greatly pleased by the addition.  The colorful chairs offer something for everyone. For freshmen, they offer more human targets during Frisbee recreation. For upperclassmen, a seat to reflect with nostalgia on the good ol’ days. For tourists, a chance to stop and smell the manure. For performers, an audience. For squirrels, a playground. For voyeurs, a venue. For fat people, a break. Or a test of will power. And in the spring, they’ll offer perverts a 360 experience of Primal Scream… The hippies can still sprawl across the lawn or rub up against a tree, but now all those people who wouldn’t otherwise plop down on the grass are appreciating the great outdoors. Even if the new chairs give only the illusion of a cohesive community, that’s better than a barren landscape of rush-in and rush-out.  The naysayers among us critique the chairs as tacky carnival props that cheapen the prestige of Harvard Yard antiquity. But those people clearly don’t realize that these fine pieces of art were modeled after those same butt-warmers found in the Jardin du Luxembourg of Paris. Hellooooo, if anything, the chairs heighten the elitist aura that we know and love. In these tough economic times, it’s the little things that count. As long as Harvard doesn’t paint John Harvard’s chair to match, I’m all for such social innovation.

I would have loved to be present at the meeting where Harvard was deciding what to do with the extra cash it saved by cutting hot breakfast, closing one library, getting rid of paper course catalogues, and increasing tuition.My guess is that it went something like this: a Barry S. Kane-esque, satchel-wearing administrator with a title that includes either “associate,” “assistant,” or “coordinator” walked into a Holyoke Center office, and triumphantly slammed down a copy of Sky Mall, that useful catalogue that gave us items like the “Hot Diggity Dogger” and a rolling backpack in which you can carry your dog. Somewhere in between the 24-karat gold copies of Lord of the Rings paraphernalia and the life-sized gorilla lawn ornament, Our Assistant to the Associate Hero must have found neon-colored metal lawn chairs left over from the set of Alice in Wonderland.Foreseeing the benefits for Cambridge townies who can’t all fit into Lamont and Café Gato Rojo, Harvard decided to order one hundred. Thank God that Assistant to the Associate picked up a copy of Sky Mall on his way back from an administrative retreat in Scottsdale, Arizona. It’s really a brilliant move if you consider two things.  First, the local yard sale and Craig’s List economy needed an injection of seating instruments and scrap metal.  Second is that all those times I want to sit and chat with friends and can’t make it to the student center in the quad, Lamont, the Barker Center, Greenhouse, a dining hall, a common room, or the steps of Widener, I can just hang out in the Yard. The good news is I can now show my dad something tangible that Harvard is doing to improve its students’ lives. That’s better than the $75 UC fee I pay every year, an investment whose lofty returns include an email a month and two student appointments to a Nutritional Information Committee.But one thing’s for certain: our Assistant to the Associate Hero has great taste—those chairs sure are cute!

It’s been a rough start to the year, what with the loss of hot breakfast and that full week before classes. Feeling down, FM decided to visit Annenberg to remember a time when we also had hopes and dreams (also, for the hot breakfast). We surveyed some freshmen about their expectations of Harvard; they revealed that the “I’ll-explore-Boston” delusion is alive and well, the mere prospect of meeting a professor is exciting enough to warrant three exclamation points, and that it’s not worth even spelling out “Pfoho.” Below are some of their memorable answers: 
Looking forward to:
“Freedom.”
“Exploring the city, making new friends, and trying new things. I’m from California, so when I made the decision to go to Harvard, I was excited about my new adventure.”
“Meeting new friends because otherwise I’ll be a loner for four years.”
“Forgetting even more names.”
“Five week winter break.”
“Destroying my ego.” 
Anxious about:“Doing laundry.”
“Getting along with my roommate.”
“A comp I’m comping..”
“Not being able to taste every kind of cereal in Annenberg.”
“Seeing grades lower than the ones I usually receive.”
“Destroying my ego.” 
Leaving the Harvard bubble:
“Often. Why? Yale, am I right?”
“I think just a couple times a month.”
“Maybe once a week.”
“MIT parties.” 
One elective you’d like to take:
“Introduction to Still Photography.”
“Archeology 1130—the one where you get to dig in the Yard.”
“I want to take something dance-related. Because I can’t dance. Not even slightly.” 
One professor you’d like to meet:
“No idea! A famous one! Maybe Diane Paulus!”
“Niall Ferguson—the guy is a rock star.”
“I’ve already semi-met him, but Howard Georgi. The beard is awe-inspiring.”
Where to find you at 3 a.m. on a 
typical weekend:“At least, hopefully I won’t be cleaning up my roommate’s vomit.”
“Sleeping. Hopefully in my own room.”
“Pretending to do homework.”
“Straddling John Harvard’s head reading an organic chemistry book with no pants on.” 
Which House you’d want to live in:
“Lowell, Leveritt [sic], Winthrop, Adams.

Nick McDonell ’06—’07 published his first novel, “Twelve,” when he was still in high school. Now, seven years later, the novel is being adapted for the big screen. In the meantime, he reported for Time and Harper’s from Iraq and Sudan, wrote two more novels, and found time to visit the Harvard Bookstore last week to read excerpts from his recently published third novel, “An Expensive Education.” FM separates fiction from fact and finds out if the author is as bad-ass as his spy characters.
 
1. 
Fifteen Minutes: In 2005, when you were about to publish your second novel, “The Third Brother,” New York Magazine called you young, good-looking, privileged, and impeccably connected. Are those things still true?
Nick McDonell: Am I all those things? I’m basically the same person I was in 2005, I think.
2. 
FM: The characters in your latest novel come from all over the world, with very       different backgrounds. Do you relate to any of them better than others?

NM: The ones I relate to most strongly are Ravi, who is a drunken journalist, and Michael Teak, who is the young idealistic spy before the fall.
3. 
FM: Why are all your protagonists named Mike?

NM: There is a possibility that they are thematically linked. I find it useful to think of the three books as a trilogy, and that name is part of what ties them together and is a sort of road sign for the way they are tied together.
4.
FM: When you were writing “An Expensive Education,” which is set partly at Harvard, did you feel a responsibility to portray Harvard accurately?

NM: I think that the only responsibility the novelist has is to the novel. I think that the notion that you would portray something as it really is in fiction is not exactly right. I think that fiction is not about portraying its topics with fact-checkable verisimilitude so much as understanding the sense of a place. And in that I think the trick is to be loyal to one’s own sensibility as a writer rather than any ideas about truth, which are really up for debate.
5.
FM: What do you consider in staying true to your writer’s sensibility? 

NM: An important one is to not take myself too seriously, and not take the writing too serious, and to approach it with a sense of humor and a grain of salt, and remember that they are just characters in what is trying to be a campus spy novel. So that was an important part of it, not to get puffed up. And the other expectations were about good writing and making for an interesting page-turner.  
6. 
FM: Were there aspects of Harvard you felt you had to include?

NM: I find interesting the interface between people who have real say in policy in foreign places, and an institution like this. So there are people, like Alex de Waal, for example, and like people in the Kennedy School, or on the faculty here, who make decisions that, occasionally, have real life implications. And also people who are recruited out of here into intelligence agencies, or the army, or anything like that. And I have romanticized that idea and taken it to its conclusion: “Uh oh, what if we’re all still sort of in college?”
 7. 
FM: One of the Harvard students in the book checks into the Charles Hotel for a night when she is upset. Do you know anyone who has ever actually done that?
NM: No, I can’t say that I do.
8. 
FM: I’ve noticed that a lot of the story takes place in Daedalus. Did you hang out there a lot as an undergrad?

NM: No, I don’t think particularly more than any of the other barflies at the time. My place was the Cellar, by far. I spent much of my time there.
9. 
FM: Susan Lowell, a professor in “An Expensive Education,” has a thing for her advisee David from the start of the novel. Were you ever hot for one of your teachers?
NM: No, I was never hot for one of my teachers.
10. 
FM: I noticed that you mentioned Fifteen Minutes on page 92 of the novel. Did you read FM?

NM: I liked FM. I knew some editors on it. I liked it.
11. 
FM: Do you regret anything about your time at Harvard?

NM: I didn’t put enough into it, in retrospect. I wish that I had studied harder, studied languages, gone after more professors, tried to get to know people better. And I was happy with it basically. I think it has the institutional flaws that it shares with other elite institutions.
12. 
FM: What was your favorite class here?

NM: My favorite class would have to be painting, Drawing with Two Hands, taught by Thomas Eggerer, or the Politics of Complex Humanitarian Emergencies by Alex de Waal.
13. 
FM: What international relations issues interest you now?
NM: I’m interested in why people, particularly people who are American and want to be involved in humanitarian prevention of war, behave the way they do. I’m interested in, for example, the way the International Criminal Court was set up, and why it has been set up the way it has, and the chasm between theoretical law and real time politics that has opened up. I’m interested in things like that, the specifics of who and why and where.
14. 
FM: The characters in your novels are always thrown into dangerous situations. What’s the most dangerous situation you’ve been in? Perhaps from reporting in Sudan or Iraq?

NM: One of the dumbest, most dangerous things I did here was dive headfirst off the Charles bridge on Halloween one night, off the Weeks Bridge. As far as danger goes, that was not such a great one. The things that happened abroad, that happened in East Africa, I’ve been remarkably lucky. Sometimes I’ve traveled in places where there was insecurity. I’ve been careful and fortunate, so it’s been okay.
15. 
FM: Are you involved in any projects currently?
NM: Oh, not so much, I have been parrying questions about having crushes on professors and things like that. No, I’m joking. I’m working on all sorts of things. I try to write a lot of fiction, but I’m working with a journalist trying to understand things like the international criminal court and American intervention abroad.

By now, Class of 2013 FOP veterans, you will have dropped your 40-pound backpacks, washed off your tarps, and showered five days of encrusted dirt off of your weary, malnourished bodies. If you were like me, perhaps you also tried unsuccessfully to wash away the indelible emotional marks that FOP seared into your brain. Or perhaps you returned an enlightened soul and reveled in your newfound confidence, the mountain air still cycling in your lungs, desperate for the FOP leader application forms.  
At the risk of voicing what I know to be the unpopular position, let me say once and for all: I hated FOP. Every grimy, sweaty, exhausting, hungry moment of it. Since I’ve never been known as a born athlete, people often find it hard to believe I was a FOPper, but I’ve hiked many times before, and love the great outdoors. What I soon discovered on FOP, however, was that my love of nature is predicated on the ability to shower after a long hike. Slowly watching my leg hair grow out over the course of five days is not my idea of a great time. Neither is using leaves for toilet paper, watching grime collect beneath my finger nails, or seeing how my stash of Neutrogena face wipes removed layers of dirt from every crevice of my face.  
But the external dirt was only part of it, as our dining habits coated my insides in their own layer of grime. As a result of the “leave no trace” policy we had to eat every single thing that was cooked, all out of the same bowl. So if the macaroni and cheese was over-concentrated (mea culpa) and left a thick, artificially cheesy residue on the inside of our already oatmeal-coated plastic bowls, we had to live with it. Sure we could swish some ionized water around to clear the bowl, but then we would have to drink down the entire concoction of oatmeal, cheese, water, and a few errant twigs and clumps of dirt. God forbid we dump it on the ground, and a squirrel should stumble upon a non-native food. Our diet was incredibly limited, and vegetarians be warned—if you don’t eat pepperoni your only lunch will be gruyère cheese...for days...and days...and days. Of course, our specially prepared trail mix helped out in those in-between times, but by the second day, deprived of any fruit or veggies (and probably developing a mild case of scurvy), I would have bartered my first-born child for a piece of crystallized pineapple. When I returned to campus I had lost 5 pounds in as many days, and devoured citrus like a British sailor.  
I know that the majority of FOP goers love their experience, and return to campus with a solid group of friends as well as memories that glow like a spider-filled twilight in the Catskills. For some, FOP is undoubtedly a cherished experience. The leaders are knowledgeable and friendly, and a spirit of openness and acceptance reigns (though with each saccharine bonding activity my morale chipped slowly away). The kids on my trip were nice, fun, and (unlike me) made the best of their experience. Nevertheless, I remain convinced that there are some people, like myself, who had an awful experience on FOP.  
The thing is, I don’t blame the leaders, the kids, or even the experience itself. But I do blame whoever allows FOP, FUP, and FAP to send so many harassing and misleading pamphlets to the homes of all incoming freshman. On just one of these pamphlets—regular covered with quotes like “I never went on FOP, and it was the worst decision of my Harvard career” and “I made all my friends on FOP!”— I would have liked to have seen a testimony along the lines of “I spent my last week before school chilling with my parents and my dog, and couldn’t have been happier.” I wish students were given a more realistic idea of the number of people who actually go on Pre-O trips, along with a couple testimonials by people who didn’t have the best time. I felt unduly pressured to participate in a Pre-O program, and for me, it was the wrong choice. So to all you FOP survivors out there, who returned to campus feeling filthy, frustrated, and slightly traumatized, I have news for you: you’re not alone.

Does your Saturday night uniform consist of jeans and a t-shirt? Too bad. In a world of leather, fur, and jeggings, you really have no excuse. Let some of Harvard’s most fashionable students show you the way to all things chic. Meet the experts at our round table discussion. Lucy W. Baird ’10, a social anthropology concentrator in Pforzheimer, is director of public relations for the Vestis Council. Her designs have been featured in a number of student fashion shows (and in the pages of FM).When asked about his fashion credentials, Sokiente W. Dagogo-Jack ’10, an economics concentrator in Dunster, simply says, “I was born fresh.” We agree. Heba el Habashy ’10, a government concentrator in Kirkland, is already leaving her mark on the fashion world. The Vestis Council comp director has worked at Dior in Paris, IMG models, and most recently at People’s Revolution under Kelly Cutrone—look out for her in the office where Whitney Port pretends to work on MTV’s The City.Quincy House’s Cara M. Lonergan ’10 is the president of Vestis Council, has photographed for Eleganza, Freeze College Magazine, and The Harvard Voice as well as interned for designer Kara Ross.Michael R. Polino ’11 is the DJ and set designer for Project East. The Lowell resident says he groomed his style growing up in the Baltimore club scene. Fifteen Minutes (FM): Fill in the blank. White t-shirt and…Baird: Red lipstick. Dagogo-Jack: Canvas sneakers. el Habashy: Leather pants.Lonergan: Oversized. With skinny pants and pointy flats. It’s all about the silhouette. FM: You returned to campus, unpacked all your clothes. What did you leave in storage? Dagogo-Jack: Anything ever made by Ed Hardy. el Habashy: Polyester leggings. Polyester in general. I don’t want to see it again. Lonergan: Juicy Couture sweat suits. I just donated mine. FM: The 80s are back. So, apparently, are the 40s. And Vogue said something about the color red? What are you buying this fall that’s on trend? Baird: High-waisted skinny jeans. Very 1940s. Lonergan: I’m looking for some chunky gold jewelry. I think it’s coming back. Dagogo-Jack: I avoid trends. FM: The weather in Cambridge sucks—rain, sleet, snow. What do you wear when the elements threaten to ruin your night? el Habashy: I don’t care about this question. Polino: One really cool thing you can wear when it’s shitty out. This year, it’s going to be a knee-length Issey Miyake jacket. FM: Okay, let’s do some word associations. Leggings. el Habashy: Ugh. FM: Jeggings. Lonergan: I don’t own a pair…yet. FM: Scarf. Dagogo-Jack: Why not. You got to tie it in the proper way. You got to leave it hanging sometimes. FM: Can you ever rock a dorm t-shirt out, at night? el Habashy: You can rock anything. FM: Where do you get a quick fashion fix in the Square? Baird: Second Time Around. Dagogo-Jack: When I have an itch to spend money I like to go to J. Press and buy one of their watch bands. They’re pretty awesome. el Habashy: Oona’sLonergan: The Tannery and Mint Julep. Polino: J. Press.FM: It’s a recession. Can you tell us how to shop our closet?Dagogo-Jack: I’m a pack rat. I work in stuff from freshman year and high school if it still fits. Lonergan: It’s all about accessories in a recession. FM: Give us a fashion tip. Baird: Dress to your body type. Know what shapes look good on your figure. Dagogo-Jack: Alexander N. Olch ’99 told me it’s better to go to a hip store and find conservative clothing than go to a conservative store and find hip clothes. Look for a tweed blazer at Opening Ceremony. Don’t look for jeans at Brooks Brothers. el Hebashy: Don’t take yourself seriously when you’re getting dressed. Fashion is supposed to be fun. Lonergan: Better to be underdressed fabulously than overdressed. Polino: I don’t do tips. I just roll…That’s not a tip.

Kelis may bring all the boys to the yard with her milkshake, but Professor Harvey G. Cox, the now-retired 9th Hollis Professor of Divinity, drew quite the crowd to Harvard Yard last week by unleashing a cow to graze on the big green to mark his retirement. “There is a long-standing legacy that the Hollis Professor had the privilege of grazing his cow in the Yard,” said Cox’s literary agent Donald R. Cutler. This became the inspiration for this event. “It was an old, old tradition told to me when I became Hollis professor,” Cox said. Though the right to graze is not explicitly stated in any official document, it was an ancient right starting with the first man to hold the esteemed position. “Edward Wigglesworth historically did graze his cows where we are now standing,” said Cox during the ceremony.As the oldest endowed chair in America, the Hollis Professor of Divinity position was funded in 1721 by Thomas Hollis, a major benefactor of Harvard in its early years and the namesake of Hollis Hall and the Hollis library catalog. According to Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Peter J. Gomes’s speech at the ceremony, the area where Tercentenary Theater now stands was once the college’s pasture, where high-ranking professors would earn the right to let their cattle, then considered a must-have accessory, graze on what Gomes called the “wild backyard.” “Pasturing cows in those days was equivalent to a parking permit,” stated Gomes in front of the boisterous audience.In his speech, Professor Cox suggested a return to a more natural lifestyle in the Yard. Students at the ceremony seemed enthusiastic about adopting this idea. “We should have cows instead of chairs tethered to the Yard,” Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 proposed.

Described by co-founder Madison O. Klein ’11 as “a club for the ridiculously good looking and extraordinarily intelligent, and for those who are of lion-hearted courageousness—and modest,” The Board Riders at Harvard (BRAH) is intent on bringing some West coast surfing culture all the way to Boston. Klein and co-founder Benjamin B. Massenburg ’11, who are from southern California and Hawaii, respectively, decided to found BRAH this year in order to bring their passion for surfing to the Harvard student body and “make some waves in the athletic community,” Klein said.Although the club’s primary focus is on surfing, it seeks to include those who are interested in skateboarding and snowboarding as well. “We like to think we embrace boarders of all walks of life,” expressed Klein.When the club debuted at the freshman activities fair, an estimated 125 people signed up. Massenburg described the turnout as “overwhelming, but also encouraging.”  Jennie K. H. Peterson ’10, who learned to surf while spending her summer in Hawaii, said she was pleased to have this opportunity to continue the sport at Harvard. “It seems like a really awesome way to get off campus and do something fun that most people don’t get to do,” Peterson said. According to the founders, BRAH intends to organize trips in the near future to give members like Peterson the opportunity to practice their various boarding skills.According to Klein, BRAH can serve the interests of both newbies and experienced surfers. “It’s important to have people that already have that appreciation and the same passion that we have, but really there’s no experience necessary,” Klein said. “We’re happy to act as teachers in this because we understand that most people in this college have never stepped foot on a surfboard.”And even with Boston’s frigid winter approaching, Klein and Massenburg are undeterred. After all, they cite recent developments in wetsuit technology as a major advance that will allow the truly devoted to pursue their sport throughout the school year.

Glamour Magazine’s September issue features their annual pick of the country’s Top Ten College Women who they believe are going to change the world, and inevitably, a Harvard gal usually makes the cut. This year,  Pforzheimer resident Marisa S. West ’10 joins the fold. FM caught up with past Harvard finalists to ask them about life after the feature. For Nancy A. Redd ’03, life has been pretty glamorous since she made the list in 2002. After being crowned Miss Virginia two weeks following her graduation, she went on to place in the top 10 during the 2004 Miss America pageant. Soon after, she wrote “Body Drama: Real Girls, Real Bodies, Real Issues, Real Answers”—a bestseller—and has another project for girls in the works. “It’s going to be the same kind of concept,” Redd said. “About what every girl goes through, and how to deal with it healthily so that we’re actually enhancing our lives instead of taking away from them.” Meghan Pasricha ’08, a 2007 pick, also works to solve social issues. “I like to focus on empowering people and giving them resources and skills, and training them so that they’ll be able to stand on their own and train other people,” she said. Pasricha co-founded Global Youth HELP (Health, Education, and Leadership Program) with her sister, Sarina Pasricha ’04. Now, as an investment banker at UBS, she continues to run the program. Meghan plans to attend business school, and hopes to create and run her own socially responsible company. Like those before her, Rebecca P. Buckwalter-Poza ’10, a 2008 winner, is more interested in public policy. She worked on the 2008 US presidential election and for the deputy press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. She’s also worked for political strategist James Carville and contributed to his new book. “I know that I want to end up in Washington, probably on the Hill, or maybe working in the administration on policy,” this 2009 Truman Scholarship winner said. “I love it there.”Wanna be like these girls? “I encourage anyone at Harvard who’s trying to figure out what they want to do, to listen to their gut and their heart, and follow their dreams and their own individual aspirations,” Redd said. With advice like that, it’s easy to see why Glamour loves these women.

You’ve got the look down, that song stuck in your head, and after six rounds of Quarters, you have a good buzz going. Now where to? FM’s here with the best of the best in three categories: final clubs, house common spaces, and party suites. They’re not always open to the whole school, however, so remember to have a back-up plan, a heavily skewed girl-guy ratio, or a good story.  Final Club: The FlyRather than merely wishing you were a fly on the wall at this illustrious final club, spice things up and stop by the Fly this weekend. Expect popped collars and popped bottles. No matter the occasion—whether a formal affair or laid-back Saturday night—the Fly always delivers. The Fly’s relaxed, classy vibe promises that you’ll start the night off on the right, albeit tipsy, foot. FYI, pastels are practically a prerequisite for the Fly’s renowned garden parties, and their old-school Gatsby bash lets a select few (invite-only, of course) party like it’s 1929. But no need to attend one of these events if you’re looking for a good time. No matter the night, come to the Fly to throw back some liquor as you soak up the refined, throw back atmosphere of this favorite party spot. For some old school Harvard flair, and a relaxed, chilled-out ambience, the Fly is the place to drink, smoke, and be classy.Honorable Mention: The SpeeIf you’re seeking a sweaty good time, the Spee is your spot. Known for its Euro Trash parties, the Spee is indeed the place to get trashed—and party like a rock star. But whether you come dressed up in costume or dressed down in jeans, the Spee is the place to shed your inhibitions. Shimmy off the calories from the bar by hitting the dance floor. After all, the Spee is the place for locking lips and limbs. With the Spee’s bursting-at-the-seams dance floor and blaring tunes, Harvard students venture to the Spee to party, and indeed, the Spee knows how to deliver. So if you’re looking to get your groove on and enjoy some eclectic tunes and unpretentious, vibrant company, head to the Spee for a guaranteed good time.House Common Space: Currier TreehouseWhile a shuttle ride to the Quad is an unfortunate part of the package, a glimpse at the Currier Treehouse will assure you that it was well worth the trek. One of Harvard’s most spacious party spots, the Treehouse is also one of the most frequented. A favorite of some of the most dynamic organizations on campus, the Treehouse is an excellent alternative for those seeking a reprieve from the final club scene. With its accessible, well-positioned bar and extensive floor space, the Treehouse never fails to pack in the booze and the people. Drink, dance, and schmooze at the Quad’s most illustrious party spot. Plus, for all you non-Quadlings, expect excellent fodder for conversation on your Shuttle ride home; debrief on all the hottest hook-ups and fashion faux pas at the denouement of a night well spent. Party Suite: Quincy TerraceThere are ways to distinguish the truly great party suites from your garden variety pong table-equipped room, and the fact that it can be found merely by following the smell of beer on a quiet Sunday afternoon places Quincy Terrace solidly in the former category. Actually two senior suites joined by a door and a balcony, the athletes who usually occupy the Terrace host parties that easily top the 100-guest mark. The balcony deserves recognition in its own right; overlooking the courtyard on two sides, it has room for several kegs, a table, massive speakers, and revelers yearning for fresh air around 1 a.m. Inside, you’ll find couches, refrigerators, and a big-screen TV, as well as a decked-out corner bar. All of this makes for a suite that can provide the setting for everything from rowdy Beerlympic games to the quieter, classier affairs.Runner-Up: Currier Ten-ManYou’re probably wondering how Currier, the House with the inanimate mascot, made it onto this esteemed list twice. Well, what this House lacks in size, proximity, and overall notoriety, it more than makes up for with serious party space. The Ten-Man—in fact occupied by ten women this year—has ten singles, a staircase, an elevator, and a common room unlikely to be paralleled in terms of sheer cubic footage. If the high ceilings weren’t enough, the skylights make this suite an apt location for the “Heaven” in the annual “Heaven and Hell” party. And the Terrace may have its balcony, but if you’re daring (and one of the residents is willing to let you walk through her single), just pop open a bedroom window and climb out onto the wide roof. Bring out a chair while you’re at it; after a hard night out, you deserve it. Honorable Mention: Mather Big TV RoomThe Box That Dunster Came In may be famous for sacrificing its dining hall and its dignity once a year for Mather Lather, but the Big TV Room and its Friday night happy hours do a better job of legitimating Mather’s reputation as a party house. With a huge window opening out into the lower level of the courtyard, it’s spacious enough to accommodate thirsty Matherites (as well as the smattering of freeloading outsiders), yet it’s also more intimate than the mindless, faceless d-hall rager. On top of it all, the House’s lax ID policy means universal access to the mixed drinks, Franzia, and, of course, the keg, which the HoCo is often thoughtful enough to fill with something a bit more flavorful than Keystone Light and its cousins. And even though it may be a hike—farther than the Quad from the center of campus by some estimates—there is the Mather Express, and you’ll catch a glimpse of the Charles at night as you walk over to the Spee.

Drunk Jenga

Assign various Jenga pieces with tasks such as: chug one beer, take one shot, give a beer, finish your drink, waterfall, etc. Play by the regular rules of Jenga, but when a player chooses a piece with a task on it, he or she must complete that task. The game ends when the tower collapses and the loser must finish his or her drink and choose three of the tasks to complete.
Difficulty Level: Low
Physical Activity Level: Minimal
Drunk Factor: Wastey

Beer Ball

Two players stand on opposite ends of a standard size beer pong table with an unopened can of beer in front of each of them. The first player chucks a ping pong ball at the second player’s can of beer. If it hits, the first player begins chugging his or her beer while the second player chases down the ball. When the second player retrives the ball, he or she slams it on the table and yells “Stop!” At this point the first player stops drinking. The goal is for each player to finish his or her beer first. Note: This game can be played in teams of two. One teammate throws, the other drinks.
Difficulty Level: Intermediate
Physical Activity Level: High
Drunk Factor: Buzzed

Odd or Even

In a group of at least two people, assign everyone as either an “odd” or an “even.” Take turns rolling a dice. If the number rolled is odd, the “odd” players must take a drink and if the number rolled is even, the “even” players must take a drink. The goal: get shitfaced.
Difficulty Level: Are you kidding me?
Physical Activity Level: Sloth
Drunk Factor: UHS

Spin the Bottle: College Style

Traditional spin the bottle except any time the bottle lands on you, you have to take a shot. The kiss is the chaser.
Difficulty Level: Middle School
Physical Activity Level: Sweaty Palms
Drunk Factor: Drunk enough to go from kiss to condom

Paranoia

Sit in a circle of at least four players. The first player will whisper a question into the ear of the player to his or her left to which the answer must be the name of another player. (Examples: Who moans the loudest during sex? Whom would you buy plastic surgery for?) The second player answers the question aloud with the name of someone in the room. The second player then flips a coin. If it’s heads, that player must also say aloud the question he or she was asked. If tails, then the player stays silent and the game continues with the next person. Note: Though there is no drinking in the formal rules of the game, believe us, you will need a few drinks to get through it.
Difficulty Level: Low
Physical Activity Level: Medium, if you consider crying and screaming physical activities
Drunk Factor: You won’t want to remember this. Blackout.

You prepped for hours getting ready, you scoped out all the coolest party spots for the night, and you even busted out some fancy dance moves just to prove that kids at Harvard can still have fun. Now you deserve to enjoy the best part of going out: drunken munchies. FM shows you that the post-game can be more fun than the game itself.

YES

Out with the old, in with the new(er). Noch’s and Felipe’s might have been good enough when you were a freshman, but isn’t it time to branch out? FM, ever fashionable, explores the newer, trendier spots on campus for your late night eats.

IHop
16 Eliot Street. Open 7 a.m.-4 a.m. everyday.
Reclaim hot breakfast! Harvard may have taken away your right to a hot meal every morning, but that doesn’t mean you have to go without. Somewhat out of the way from Harvard’s central partying scene, Ihop provides a down-to-earth, value-friendly atmosphere, where no one will judge you for scarfing down that omelet, bacon, and pancakes. And the biggest perk: they take Crimson Cash. 

Trata 
49 Mt. Auburn St. Open until 1 a.m. Thursdays-Saturdays.
When a more upscale, sit-down atmosphere is desired, Trata is mere steps from final clubs, Daedalus, and Quincy. They have the usual staple of inebriated dining—pizza—and also items to put on Daddy’s credit card—salmon filets and peppercorn crusted steak, among others. Hit up the extensive beer and wine list if you begin to lose your buzz.

Quincy Grille
Quincy House. 58 Plympton St. Open until 2 a.m. on Thursdays; 4 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays.
While the selection is limited, the atmosphere is rowdy, and the service is subpar, the Quincy Grille is the only place to get food where everybody knows your name. Whether ordering mozz sticks, chicken fingers, a cheeseburger, or sweet potato fries, chances are the person serving it is someone you had in section, someone you hooked up with, or your blockmate. While you can only pay for this greasy goodness with cash, you can always ask your teammate sitting at the table over to spot you. 

Market in the Square
60 Church Street. Open 24/7.
The Market offers everything from freshly-made sandwiches and sushi to hot entrees and hard-to-find imported cookies and candy. Plus it’s always open. Some may complain it’s expensive, but must cheap drunks eat cheap drunk food?

Zoe’s
1105 Mass. Ave. Opens at 7:30 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays; 8 a.m. on Sundays.
The sun is rising as you finally leave the depths of the Delphic basement. Or maybe you’ve snuck out early from that cutie’s single to avoid the walk of shame rush hour. Get to Zoe’s. Their dishes come with pure maple syrup and creative omelette options exist for the health-conscious. Generous portions replenish stomachs now empty from the night’s activities.

Falafel Corner
8 ½ Eliot St. Open until 3 a.m. Thursdays-Saturdays.
New to the Square, this Middle Eastern joint serves up the usual falafel and shawarma dishes late into the night, in addition to many desserts. The menu’s variety and quick service make the walk worth it from the Yard or more distant Houses. However, the atmosphere is reminiscent of an underground clinic, so FM recommends the food to-go. Also stop at the bank on way—cash only.

Kong
1236 Mass Ave. Open until 2:30 a.m. on Thursdays; 3 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
It’s 2 a.m. on a Saturday night, you just got shut down by that freshman in the Quad, and all you need is a good meal to sober you up before you go home. This is not the time to get creative. Ditch the classier options, and just head straight to the Kong. Their crispy scallion pancakes and greasy lo mein will hit the spot every time. It’s an oldie but a goodie.

NO

Drunk or not, it’s inexcusable to waste what could be a great post-party meal on one of these places. FM did the research, so you don’t have to.

Au Bon Pain
1360 Mass. Ave. Open until midnight on Thursdays and Fridays; 1 a.m. on Saturdays.
Convenient? Yes. Offensively pungent? Yes. Overpriced? Insultingly so. Just say no.
Vending Machines
Everywhere and anywhere. Open 24/7. 
There’s just something sad about ending your drunken escapade waiting on a machine for your satisfaction. Even if you didn’t get that hookup you were after, opt for some human interaction at the end of your night.

Budget cuts have swept through campus faster than news of a party during Freshman Week. But apparently the administration didn’t make it to the end of “Confessions of a Shopaholic,” because they’ve still done a lot of spending on stuff nobody really needs or cares about. FM presents some of the areas where Harvard is still losing money like a trip to the COOP. 15) The Polynesian dancers at the recent Aloha Harvard event. Although apparently we didn’t pay them enough to do the hula. 14) Picking out new couches for the Dunster Library, which is only open from 12-4 on Friday and Saturday. The four people who will notice this say thanks. 13) Boston weather will only permit us to sit in the new chairs in the Yard and the Quad for a combined total of about 20 days in the entire school year. Much cheaper to bring blankets and sit on the grass. Nature is in. 12) A class of 2013 convocation because the freshman still want more “pomp and circumstance,” so we give them a ceremony just to make them happy. 11) Self-locking doors installed—because we can’t lock the doors ourselves? If you refuse to lock your door, don’t complain about getting your stuff stolen. 10) Red phones in the rooms. The only calls we get on them are from advertisements. 9) Repainting Rev. Gomes’s house. This is just a guess, but I doubt it can maintain that incredible shade of yellow without regular upkeep. 8) Resident Deans. House Masters. House Administrators. House Superintendents. Assistant Resident Deans. Assistants to the Assistant Resident Deans?  This is not the Federal Government of the United States. We do not need a system of checks-and-balances. 7) While many can appreciate the effort to re-guild the walls of Adams dining hall, we’d rather be able to sit down to a hot breakfast. Eat the gold dome we cannot. 6) We can get drunk in public without spending thousands to have Sarah Bareilles serenade us with the one song we know. Half of us didn’t make it to Yardfest anyhow. And the other half probably don’t remember it. 5) Folklore and Mythology department. Sanskrit. All departments with less than ten people. Sorry guys, but can’t you just consolidate into one “Old Shit” department? 4) I called the evening van service and told them I had a broken leg. They never came. Instead they suggested I walk to Lamont and catch the shuttle there. 3) An entire building for Gen Ed. Isn’t this what FAS meetings are for? 2) Organic Manure in the Yard. Oh, now I get why we need chairs instead of just blankets. Gross. 1) We’re all for supporting local farmers. But do we need to eat squash with every meal?

Food is every bit as prone to trends as fashion. Just as thigh-high boots are having a moment on the fall catwalks, food trucks are enjoying an extended welcome on the dining scene.By spring, food truck frenzy reached its media tipping point. In late April, the Boston Globe ran a piece on Clover, an eco-friendly MIT food truck. In June, the Wall Street Journal investigated the nitty gritty of the ambulatory food biz. Then came July, when the LA Times devoted nearly 1000 words to the topic, highlighting Korean BBQ sensation Kogi, which shills short rib tacos to mass acclaim. Why all the fuss?Let me explain it this way: it’s like the difference between spotting a rare Iberian lynx in the wild versus watching it in a zoo cage. Hunting down that Korean short rib taco from something as sketchy as a food truck is just a whole lot sexier than ordering it in a restaurant. Sometimes, the truck locations will only be communicated via Twitter, adding another layer of mystery. I’m obviously not referring to lukewarm dogs and Mr. Frosty soft serve—this isn’t your grandmother’s food truck. The eco-friendly Clover Food Lab on Carleton Street near MIT showcases higher aspirations. Think: handcut fries married with rosemary and salt, a bomb chickpea fritter, and vegan banana nut muffins. Lunch is imbued with so much more coolness if you have to hunt it down and trap it like the hardened food warrior you are.Plus, there’s that thing called the Recession that makes budget eats appealing. Isn’t it nice to know that you’re not actually paying for a restaurant’s gold bathroom fixtures?Ever on the cutting edge, our beloved chickwich-schiller HUDS (I write that fondly) installed three food carts, two in Harvard Yard and one by Dudley. They each have their own theme. The Science Center one is “Organic Deli,” which means that the sandwich fillings have gratuitous adjectives like “sun-dried” and “dry cured.” Walk across the Yard, and you’ll hit the Mediterranean stand by Boylston Hall, where you can get a falafel fix. The last stop by Dudley is standard American fare—burgers, hot dogs, and chicken sandwiches. They join the ranks of two non-HUDS food trucks which can’t use prime real estate: a pizza and pasta purveyor on Divinity Ave and a little-known Chinese food truck on Oxford St outside of Maxwell Dworkin.In the name of research, I gave two of the HUDS carts a try.Organic Deli was my first stop. My lunch partner and I used the colorful new chairs in the Yard. When I opened the paper wrapping and bit into my chicken salad sandwich ($7.50), I can only describe it as one of the most unfortunate bread failures I’ve experienced this year. The success of a sandwich relies, in large part, on the carbs that lovingly cushion the top and bottom. And this stuff was terrible. What did this innocent loaf do in a previous life to justify this? Even my friend, a red-blooded male, complained, and he was eating a version with bacon! And I thought that bacon could make anything delicious.By the time I came within an inch of the crusts, the bread was so dry it had begun to disintegrate. The chicken salad was solidly in the gourmet-inspired mediocrity class—large chunks of white meat interspersed with dried cranberry and celery—but nothing was able to overshadow the whole wheat terror of the bread. You could, like, refill a kitty litter box with this stuff. I deeply regretted not buying a drink.I fared much better with the Mediterranean cart parked in front of Boylston. I perhaps wisely avoided the falafel ($4.95), which is tricky to get right, and went with a beef kebab wrap ($6.25) on Syrian bread. Like the spice lover I am, I ordered it doused with tahini—a sesame paste—and hot sauce. It was best eaten in giant, gaping mouthfuls and washed down with some Diet Coke. The fresh crunch of the tomato and cukes contrasted nicely with the juicy chunks of well-seasoned beef.My major bone to pick is that this stuff is not freshly made. But there was definitely potential in my beef kebab wrap. Sure, they could have cut the beef into smaller pieces. They could have at least heated it up to capitalize on how friggin’ delicious a hot, greasy kebab is. But it was good enough. And good enough, by HUDS standards, amounts to not damn bad.This isn’t an invitation to rejoice that the food truck trend has hit Harvard Yard. But it’s not a bad option.Just stay away from the whole wheat bread.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little more than a year after University President Drew G. Faust vowed to cut Harvard’s net greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2006 levels over the course of eight years, the University has continued its sustainability push with the installation of five solar-compacting trash bins on Aug. 25.
The five “Big Belly” recycling and trash stations—located at the south-side entrance of the Science Center, Holworthy Gate, Holyoke Gate, the northwest entrance of Grays Hall, and Boylston plaza—replaced two non-compacting trash and recycling bins in the Yard.
The new Harvard Yard recycling bins were purchased by a joint effort between Facilities Maintenance Operations (FMO) Recycling & Waste Services and FMO Landscape Services. 
“Landscape Services strongly encouraged us to do this,” said Recycling Services Associate Manager Rob Gogan. “They wanted to reduce the time workers chased after refuse in the yard.” 
Gogan said that tourists and students often littered when trash cans appeared full, and a lot of recyclable waste would be thrown away. A non-compacting trash can has to be emptied up to three times a day during warm months. The new compacting bins are checked daily but emptied only every two to three days.
“More waste is recycled now that there are recycling bins as well,” Gogan added. 
With a capacity for holding and compacting four times more litter than a non-compacting barrel, the “Big Belly” containers reduce by three-fourths the greenhouse gases emitted from vehicle trips to service the new receptacles, according to Gogan.
Other benefits include less vehicle noise and air pollution, and fewer disruptions of pedestrian traffic in the Yard.
As another facet of the University’s emissions-reducing program, Gogan said that Harvard has entered into a competition to see which campus can recycle the most waste at a home football game.

Starting next academic year, Harvard’s Graduate School of Education will offer a new tuition-free doctoral degree program that aims to better equip 25 graduates each year with skills needed to transform the U.S. education system, school officials announced today.The three-year Doctor of Education Leadership Program will be led by faculty at the School of Education, the Harvard Kennedy School, as well as Harvard Business School, and is being billed as the first of its kind in the nation.Doctoral students at the School of Education currently graduate with an Ed.D.—essentially a research degree not specifically designed to prepare them for shaping education policy, said School of Education Dean Kathleen McCartney.“We really needed to think about a practice doctorate like a J.D. in law or an M.D. in medicine,” McCartney said. “We have to think about how to have a greater impact on education policy and practice, since we already have a huge impact on education research.” The program is designed for students who already have a few years of work experience and possibly an “entry-level” leadership position in the workplace. It offers a year-long residency program at a Harvard-approved education organization—including Teach for America, well-developed urban school districts across the country, or the Massachusetts Department of Education—during their third year.Instead of writing dissertations, which McCartney said do little to train future education policymakers and leaders, students enrolled in the new program will receive hands-on training and lead a “capstone project” at the partner organization where they do their residencies.“This program is a big experiment on our part,” McCartney said. “If it’s successful, we hope it will become a model for other education schools.”The School of Education plans to raise $77 million to support the program—roughly $1 million per student—and the school has currently raised $34 million through a combination of re-purposed funds and donations, most notably, a $10 million grant from The Wallace Foundation, which “seeks to support and share effective ideas and practices that will strengthen education leadership, arts participation and out-of-school learning,” according to its Web site.Planning for the new degree program first started in December 2005, and McCartney, then the school’s acting dean, asked The Parthenon Group, a consulting firm with an office in Boston, to conduct a market research study to determine what skills employers would be looking for in an Ed.L.D. graduate.With guidance from the study’s findings, faculty from the three participating schools designed a “modular-based”—rather than a traditional course-based—curriculum, with emphasis on three areas, including learning and teaching, leadership and management, and understanding and transforming the education sector.The experimental program sparked considerable discussion among faculty when first introduced, McCartney said, and school administrators will be closely monitoring faculty and student feedback for the program.Arthur E. Levine, the president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation and former president of Teachers College at Columbia, expressed his support for the new leadership program. Levine published a study surveying education schools across the country a few years ago, concluding that the majority of programs offered do not adequately prepare aspiring teachers for the classroom.“Admission standards were low, curricula weren’t tied to any skills people needed in their jobs, and field experience was weak,” Levine said. “I looked around the country for an exemplary program and couldn’t find one.”But the “innovative” elements of the School of Education’s new leadership program show promise, Levine said.Levine, who taught at the School of Education roughly two decades ago, pointed to the “richness” of the third-year residency program as well as the school’s collaboration with faculty at the Kennedy School and the Business School in particular as strengths.The real challenge, Levine said, is whether the School of Education is able to implement the program as planned.“What stands out now is the creativity, the boldness, the coherence of the plan,” Levine said. “But every one of those parts need to be implemented.”—Staff writer June Q.

Police said yesterday that the death of Annie Le—the Yale graduate student whose body was discovered stuffed into the basement wall of her lab building—was a targeted killing and not an act of random violence, though officials declined to name a suspect as the investigation continued.“We’re not believing it’s a random act,” police spokesman told the Associated Press, as investigators sought to ease student fears on campus.ABC News and NBC News reported yesterday that investigators are focusing their efforts on a suspect who failed a lie detector test and has what appear to be defensive wounds.Citing an unidentified source, NBC News reported that the suspect was a student, though not necessarily one enrolled at Yale.Annie Le’s body was found in an area that housed utility cables for the four-story lab building at 10 Amistad St., located 10 blocks from Yale’s main campus.An autopsy yesterday confirmed that the body found in the Yale Medical School building was Le.This tragic discovery came just hours after Le was expected to marry Columbia University graduate student Jonathan Widawsky in an outdoor ceremony at the North Ritz Club on Long Island. The families canceled the wedding last Friday—three days after Le first went missing.“Our hearts go out to Annie Le’s family, fiancé and friends,” wrote Yale University President Richard C. Levin in an e-mailed statement to the Yale community Sunday night.Security cameras and swipe access records showed that Le, a 24-year-old pharmacology student, last entered the lab building on Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. There was no record of her leaving the building.After Le’s disappearance was first noted later on Tuesday, suspicions of a runaway bride soon turned to alarm about possible foul play. By Thursday, a $10,000 reward had been posted for Le’s whereabouts, while investigators searched every corner of the lab building.On Saturday, police officers found bloody clothes above the ceiling tiles in the lab building, though later reports said that the clothes were not those Le was last seen wearing when she entered the building last Tuesday.Peter Reichard, the assistant New Haven police chief, said in a news conference Sunday night that no more details can be disclosed in the ongoing homicide case. Yale’s last campus murder occurred in December 1998, when senior Suzanne N. Jovin, 21, was stabbed to death in a wealthy neighborhood about 2 miles from campus. Her death remains unsolved.—Staff writer Manning Ding can be reached at ding3@fas.harvard.edu.

Morality finds its roots in shared genetics, which imbue humans with a common moral framework, said renowned Harvard Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser in a seminar yesterday. 
“In the same way every child is born with the capacity to learn language, we are born to universal moral grammar, the toolkit for moral systems,” Hauser said.  
Hauser, the author of “Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong,” stimulated conversation at the Barker Center event about the discrepancies between conventional and moral transgressions. He asked hypothetical questions that kindled debate among the approximately 25 students in attendance about potential driving forces for human behavior, ranging from genetics to the environment.
Hauser then shared his latest research on neurogenetic problems—he is currently studying a population of psychopaths, whom he characterized as lacking social emotion.
One audience member, Spencer B.L. Lenfield ’12, said he was most interested in Hauser’s discussion of the awareness of morality compared to empathy.
“Even beyond his interpretation of ethical questions, I am inspired to think about the moral ideas presented for a long time to come,” Lenfield said. 
Jackson M. Kernion ’12, co-chair of the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior (HSMBB), which organized the event, said he is particularly curious about Hauser’s research 
with wild monkeys. The professor’s findings have suggested that humans are not alone in their morality because it is an intrinsic quality.
“What Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker did for language, [Hauser] is doing for neuroscience,” Kernion said.   
HSMBB developed as an offshoot of the University’s interfaculty initiative in Mind, Brain and Behavior. The group revamped its mission this year and seeks to provide an opportunity for students to supplement coursework with learning in a more intimate capacity, while also gaining exposure to the breadth of research available on campus.
“So much of the learning here takes place outside the classroom in conversations. We seek to facilitate that,” said HSMBB Co-Chair Sophie R. Wharton ’11. “We also embrace the interdisciplinary idea, and we hope the seminars will give people a taste of something new or spark an interest.” 
HSMBB plans to host one seminar per week and feature speakers from all MBB disciplines including Neurobiology, Psychology, Philosophy, Human Evolutionary Biology, Computer Science, Linguistics, and History of Science.

In the five months since Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith held a town hall meeting with the FAS community regarding a then-$220 million deficit, proposed solutions to the budgetary quagmire have been scant, breeding confusion among faculty and staff, who hope that this afternoon’s “Discussion with the Dean” will end the dry spell.During the open forum—which will be held from 3:30 to 5:00 in Science Center B, with an adjacent lecture hall reserved for overflow—Smith will discuss “the positive financial results” from the last fiscal year and take questions from the audience, he wrote in an e-mailed statement sent to faculty and staff last Tuesday. Smith said he will begin today’s meeting with a preview of the annual Dean’s report, which will survey FAS’ financial data for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008. The report—whose release had been delayed from this past spring to early October—will outline information concerning FAS finances for fiscal year 2009 as well, Smith said at a May faculty meeting.“In this new year, as I did during the difficult times of the past year, I will stay in close contact with our large and diverse community,” Smith wrote. “I hope my communications will help each of you to understand the progress we are making to overcome the financial challenges that beset the FAS.”Despite Smith’s overtures at open communication between administrative decision-makers and the rest of the Faculty, some faculty and staff said in interviews with The Crimson that information regarding FAS’ financial status has been sparse to nonexistent in the past few months.“Nothing. Nothing, other than Mike [Smith] sending out a notice saying there will be a meeting...There’s no transparency,” said Engineering Professor Frederick H. Abernathy, who expressed frustration at the absence of administrative outreach in the face of a gaping deficit.At the town hall meeting in April, Smith called for a broad-based restructuring of FAS to close a $220 million deficit over the next two years. In May, $77 million of possible savings proposed by FAS units were implemented in a sweeping round of cuts, which later included mass layoffs for staff. Smith charged six working groups with identifying the remaining $143 million. Those groups have seen varying degrees of progress since their creation.“He is in the unenviable position of serving as Dean during the school’s—through no fault of his—most significant financial crisis,” wrote FAS Associate Dean Robert G. Doyle in an e-mailed statement. “I admire his willingness to personally address the faculty, students, and staff and his willingness to face unscripted questions.”Richard Tuck, chair of the social studies committee, said there has not been “much detailed discussion” concerning the FAS budget of late. “I don’t think that it will be revealed that the picture is much rosier than we thought,” said Jay H. Jasanoff, interim chair of the linguistics department. “I think that we’re going to hear that great stringencies are required still, and I will be listening closely to hear whether the nuances make it sound a little less dire than last spring.”The forum, which will be recorded for later viewing on the Web, may be Smith’s opportunity to dispel the sense of benightedness that has left faculty and staff grasping for answers.“This is his chance,” Abernathy said. “It behooves the dean to tell us financially where we are, because that’s what the dean’s job is.”—Staff writer Bonnie J.

Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, editor of “The Passionate Torah: Sex and Judaism,” arrived at the Harvard Book Store last night for an event co-organized with Harvard Hillel, reading from the new book and looking to address some of the mysteries of Jewish sexuality.“This is meant to be a playground for new thinking on Jewish sex,” Ruttenberg said of her book. “I just sort of convened the conversation.” The book, a compendium of essays from leading Jewish and non-Jewish academics on topics ranging from masturbation to modesty, was published in June by New York University Press. Yet despite the academic credentials of the authors who penned most of the book’s essays, Ruttenberg said that she designed The Passionate Torah with “the intelligent lay reader in mind.” “The whole idea is that smart people are capable of dealing with big questions,” she said. “I wanted to take them seriously.” A graduate of both Brown and Los Angeles’s Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies, Ruttenberg has written several other books, including “Yentl’s Revenge: The Next Wave of Jewish Feminism,” and currently serves on the editorial board at Jewschool.com. She said that the idea for The Passionate Torah came to her after she had an idea for an essay related to the topic. “Sex is Torah,” she said in her address to the audience of around 30, mostly composed of older Cambridge locals and a few students. “It’s part of our spirituality and part of our connection to the divine.”Ruttenberg summarized some of the issues in her book at yesterday’s talk, working her way easily from the presence of  homoeroticism in sexually segregated communities to the role of female masturbation in Jewish sacred texts.“Sex toys are mentioned in the Talmud, but female masturbation is not,” she said. After reading a steamy passage from the thirteenth century about the sexual effects of circumcision, Ruttenberg looked up from her notes, asking the audience, “See how great it is to be a Jew?” Michael Simon, associate director of Harvard Hillel, said that his organization often works with the Harvard Bookstore to bring in speakers Hillel could not necessarily attract alone. In the past, the team has co-hosted events for such speakers as writer Michael Chabon and diplomat Dennis Ross.“We have an opportunity to bring in writers who are grappling with the questions of what it means to be Jewish and what it means to be human,” Simon said. “Asking these questions about sexuality is particularly important for our students.” Ruttenberg admitted some might find the contents of her book too controversial. “Frankly, there are lots and lots of Jews who don’t take me seriously at all,” she said. But the crowd lined up to buy copies of The Passionate Torah. “I would say it’s controversial but not taboo,” said Reyzl R. Geselowitz ’10. —Staff writer James K. McAuley can be reached at mcauley@fas.harvard.edu.

After six months away from the ivory tower calm of the economics department’s Littauer headquarters, economics professor Jeremy C. Stein—who was in the nation’s capital serving out a term as senior adviser to the treasury secretary—is back at Harvard and ready to reflect on the experience.His meetings with the National Economic Council and with President Barack Obama now in the rearview mirror, Stein has returned to his research and the slow, methodical pace of academic life. He will be teaching an undergraduate course on the financial crisis next semester, he says, and he will be taking care to ensure that the course consists of more than just his own “war stories.” But he’s not entirely free of nostalgia.  It was “unbelievably exciting,” Stein says, recalling his government experience recently to Crimson reporters in the quiet of his office, hundreds of miles from the crush of the Capital Beltway. “Here, I have a schedule,” he says. “There, you show up with nothing on your calendar and then run around until 11 at night.” Last January, the same week Obama was inaugurated, Stein received a phone call from former University President Lawrence H. Summers, now head of the National Economic Council, asking if he would come to Washington to help work on the economic recovery plan.It was a seminal moment of the financial crisis—the stimulus plan was being drafted just as the stock market headed for record lows.Within a week, Stein had passed his spring teaching duties to Visiting Professor Owen A. Lamont and was on his way south after nine years at Harvard.Specializing in finance, Stein worked most intensely on the financial stability plan, which he describes as “the effort to deal with the current problems of the banking and what some call the ‘shadow banking’ system.”“There was an awful lot going on,” Stein says. “We were trying to put out the fire and write a new fire code at the same time.”Attending meetings and debating policy points, Stein was part of a team of top financial analysts from the NEC and the Treasury Department, working together to form government policy towards banks and other troubled corporations.He says many a night was spent with long-time friend Summers, “sitting up at night arguing parts of economic theory.”Summers “had an unbelievable appetite” for understanding the economics of the decisions being made, says Stein, who has known Summers since the mid-80s when Stein first began as an associate professor at the Business School.Stein also described a less familiar experience—presidential briefings. “[Obama] was keenly interested,” Stein says. One briefing developed into a six hour meeting, he says.Throughout the experience in Washington, Stein explains, there was a great sense of urgency. At the worst point, “you felt like you were staring into the abyss.”The situation made for late nights at work and little social life. Stein lived “like a college kid again,” he says—out of a suitcase, without a car, eating Chinese food and returning home to Massachusetts on weekends—if the economy allowed—to be with his family. “[Stein] really was the right man at the right time,” says University of Chicago Business School Professor Anil K. Kashyap, who has been working with Stein for more than 20 years. “I give the President and Larry Summers a lot of credit. They convinced him to uproot his life and his teaching to go down there.”Stein’s return hardly marks the end of the line for Harvard’s presence in Washington. Yesterday, Business School Professor David S. Scharfstein began work with the administration. Scharfstein could not be reached for comment over the last week. And as for Stein? The rigors of Washington have made him none the worse for wear, colleagues say. “He’s back, he’s teaching his course, and everything is normal,” says Lamont, who remained at Harvard for the fall semester. “It’s not like he’s bald. He is his old healthy self.”—Staff writer Noah S. Rayman can be reached at nrayman@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Elyssa A.L. Spitzer can be reached at spitzer@fas.harvard.edu.

I stumbled into the Adams dining hall last Thursday at an ungodly hour in the hopes of digging into a juicy omelette, a pile of crunchy bacon, and maybe a flapjack or two. But I was instead hit by the harsh, cold reality that is breakfast on a (tanking) budget. I scanned the hall to see what other poor creatures were eating at this “breakfast,” and came to the realization that there were nearly as many hand sanitizers present as there were people (It’s hard to tell if the dining halls are serving food or prepping for surgery...). I decided to postpone my personal (mal)nourishment and fulfill my duty as Roving Reporter by asking my fellow students what they thought about the criminal lack of hot breakfast during the week this year. Andrew M. Goldberg ’10, LowellRR: How do you feel about the cuts of hot breakfast this year?AMG: Annoying. Kinda rude.RR: You don’t think cottage cheese and ham are breakfast foods?AMG: Those aren’t food at all.RR: Well do you have a favorite knockoff cereal here?AMG: I don’t eat those, but I do like the hemp and granola. Especially the hemp. It’s kinda like getting high.RR: And then I guess that helps you eat more... What would you do for an omelette   right now?AMG: That’s not printable.  Richard A. Newcomb ’12, DunsterRR: Do you miss the hot breakfast?RAN: Well, I just had a waffle. It was semi-warm.RR: How many hot breakfasts do you think we could buy if we sold that 60 inch flat screen T.V. in there? I’m not so sure that I need to see slideshows about squash in HD.RAN: (Laughs) A lot. At least 50 or 60.RR: Wow, you must be eating some expensive breakfasts. Have you ever been to Saturday breakfast? I thought they should have tried cutting that first.RAN: Once. Usually there is no way in hell I would be at Saturday breakfast. Lisa S. Ma ’12, QuincyRR: So how’s your breakfast?LSM: Eh. It’s gonna be pretty much the same everyday.RR: Personal issue here for me... I’m from the South and an admitted grits lover. Even when they had hot breakfast, they never had grits. Do you even know what grits are?LSM: Is that that pink stuff?RR: (Look of horror. Sadly shakes head.)  Christine Wu ’12, AdamsRR: Being a varsity volleyball player, how have the cutbacks of hot breakfast affected you after your morning practices? CW: Well, we don’t have many morning workouts, but my first craving was definitely eggs and toast after morning practice. And I don’t know how some of the other athletes like the crew and football guys survive now.RR: There’s been some controversy over grits this morning. What are your thoughts on this food of the gods?CW: Well they have other ethnic or regional foods, it doesn’t seem very expensive, and there are lots of people here from the South.RR: Amen sister.   Miyoko T. Pettit ’11, MatherRR: Do you have a favorite among our collection of knockoff cereals?MTP: The crack. Cracklin’ Oat Bran.RR: Maybe not the best time to be making drug references on campus... too soon?

Warning to all River House residents: don’t do your laundry tomorrow between 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., or all of your whites may turn a lovely rust color. The FMO Fire Group will be performing the annual check of Harvard’s fire hydrants tomorrow evening, and in doing so they may knock some of the silt at the bottom of sedentary pipes back into the river houses’ waterways.
The silt – “That’s just normal sediment. Pieces of rust from the pipes themselves… minerals mostly,” according to John P. Boucher, supervisor for fire safety services for FMO Fire Group – may color the water, making faucets run yellowy-orange water.
But quadlings, don’t be too quick to mock the river. Fell free to rejoice tomorrow, but the silty sinks will soon head out there, too. All of Harvard’s hydrants will be checked sometime this fall, Boucher said.
The rust colored water, though unappetizing, is safe for consumption. (Boucher said he would drink it.)

Here’s the text of the announcement:
THE FMO FIRE GROUP WILL BE CONDUCTING ANNUAL FIRE HYDRANT MAINTENANCE AND FLOW TESTS BETWEEN  4:00PM AND 8:00PM IN THE River Area
Maintenance and testing will be conducted between the hours 4:00PM and 8:00PM Hydrant testing is performed to ensure operability and to identify and repair those hydrants requiring maintenance. In addition to hydrant testing, we will be performing water main flushing.
Hydrant testing may disturb the sediment that naturally occurs in the water piping system. Water from your faucets and toilet may appear rust colored from this disturbance. Rust discoloration may last for several hours after the tests have been completed. Discolored water does not usually present a health hazard, however; it is recommended that anyone who has doubts about the rust colored water should not drink it. If you do not have bottled water, you may wish to store tap water in your refrigerator for the day of the test.
We also suggest that dorm residents check their water before doing laundry because the discolored water may stain clothes. If you would like to know when the hydrants are being tested in your area, please review the schedule shown below or call the FMO Fire Safety Services at 617- 496-4075  for daily test locations. If you have any questions on water quality  Jim Cullity at 617-894-6841.
Locations: River Area                                   Date: Tuesday September 15, 2009

Swine flu strikes again! This time, it's the Harvard field hockey team that's suffering. Already shorthanded due to a small roster and injuries, the Crimson has lost several players to the dreaded virus over the past week.
The flu has prompted the team to postpone its Wednesday night game against New Hampshire until it has enough healthy players to fill out the team.
Harvard's off to its best start since 2005, opening the season with three straight wins. Perhaps swine flu has some as-yet-undocumented benefits for field hockey excellence? Only time will tell. The Crimson, health-permitting, begins Ivy play on Saturday at Yale.

Face it. By the time you’re a senior, few things have the ability to excite anymore.
Being able to walk into Louie’s and get yourself a case of Dos Equis without resorting to groveling at Mr. Chen’s feet? Been there, done that. Harvard-Yale? Hard to believe, but winning gets old after the 804913th time. Primal scream? Yawn.
Yet there was always one ray of light that had the power to shake seniors out of their 16-years-of-education-induced ennui, that could beckon them -- in hordes -- out of the insular comfort of their spacious suites and prompt them to make the pilgrimage to the northern reaches of campus: Upper Hall.
For the square out there, that would be the venerable program that promised 156 members of the senior class unlimited booze three drinks (!) at the Queen’s Head Pub (plus a spiffy stein, a special Upper Hall keychain, and discounted food) on Friday evenings in exchange for a $50 membership fee.
The Pub called it the solution to the "direly needed center of student life," Facebook declared owning a stein to be the source of "undying glory and the envy of underclassmen," and each event drew an average of 1100 students (translation: Ec10 times two) when it debuted in 2007.
Sounds great, right?? Except, um, FlyBy has bad news for this year's senior class.
It turns out that Upper Hall is not taking place this year... Or ever again, for that matter.
Upper Hall, according to Cambridge Queen's Head Manager Scott Smider '01, was made possible through the donation of an alum who took it upon him/herself to loosen up the senior class. The donation was meant to last for just 2007-2008, but with some good bookkeeping, managed to be stretched out for the class of '09, as well.
"The program was not profitable. It was entirely subsidized by the donation from the alum," Smider said.
Unlimited booze, enduring glory? Damn it, we knew it was too good to last.

Ben Affleck was at Grendel's Den today shooting a scene for his new movie, "The Town," along with wife Jennifer Garner (FlyBy was a huge Alias fan.) and daughters Violet and Seraphina.
Parking was blocked off on part of Plympton Street to make room for the production crew, and a sign on JFK warned passersby that they may well appear in the movie inadvertently.

And just when you were considering going out and buying surgical masks...We're saved! UHS is now offering free flu vaccinations from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. every Monday and Tuesday until May 28!!!1!one
Except...this isn't the vaccine for the swine. You're only safe from regular seasonal flu.
In the event that you do want to avoid that (probably a good idea, FlyBy thinks), UHS ordered 19,000 doses of vaccine this year, up from 12,000 most years, says The Gazette. And anyone with a Harvard ID or a Harvard University Group Health Plan card can go claim theirs.
Sick! Yeah. We know. That was a terrible pun. Let the rush begin!
