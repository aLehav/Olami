After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is no shortage of articles on The Crimson’s website centering on shopping week and the student body’s frustration with its suspension. Many of these pieces reminisce about a bygone era when students spent the first week of the semester exploring the term’s offerings before submitting a final schedule. As evidenced by the student body’s overwhelming opposition to the College’s new course registration process, shopping week remains an immensely popular staple of Harvard’s liberal arts education that students are determined to protect. Notwithstanding that reality, it’s time to reflect more objectively on the people in our community who lose out from shopping week, and to realize that the stress and logistical difficulties it imposes on graduate students and faculty may not be justified.
For graduate students trying to juggle their own class registration, coursework, and research, shopping week brings an uncertainty in class enrollment that can be unfairly burdensome. When professors don’t know how many teaching fellows they need, graduate students who count on those jobs can’t effectively structure their schedules, their course plans, or their finances. Administrators are similarly burdened, especially in small or under-administered departments: they are left holding the bag when class sizes fluctuate wildly from day to day.
Of course, the loss of shopping week is devastating to undergraduate students, many of whom chose to attend Harvard because of its unique course registration process. But we should empathize with the graduate students and faculty for whom shopping week has been an anxiety-inducing stressor. We should listen to them when they tell us that course preview period is what works best for them.
As undergraduate students, we must remember that this community includes not only our peers in the classroom, but also the graduate students and professors who teach us. We affirm our support of the Editorial Board’s pro-labor stance when it comes to the systemic issues that Harvard’s graduate student body faces. We supported graduate students when they striked in 2019, and we opined in favor of the HGSU-UAW strike in 2021. Throughout our difficult conversations about the future of course registration, these are the voices we must amplify in order to reach a compromise that serves all those impacted.
We echo student concerns that course preview period, as it has stood for the past four semesters, has been a shoddy replacement for the free and informative exploration that shopping week offered. When professors take course preview period seriously — hosting Zoom Q&As, posting robust Canvas sites, and sharing exemplary course materials — a post-shopping week Harvard comes into view, one that retains its academic flexibility and informed course selection. Some professors, however, have not taken such a robust approach to course preview period, offering no opportunities for engagement beyond posting their syllabi. If course preview period is to succeed in replacing rather than merely displacing shopping week, the administration must require a certain level of honesty in professors’ pre-term engagement.
It’s clear there are many reasons for undergraduates to love and miss shopping week, but this love doesn’t take into account the burden placed on others. There is no reason why course preview period can’t effectively replace shopping week, especially during the pandemic but even beyond it. Doing so will simply demand a greater measure of empathy and respect for our fellow undergraduates, faculty members, graduate students, and one another.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disabled people exist at Harvard — but you probably wouldn’t know it at first glance.
There are no classes focused on disability taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the undergraduate level this academic year. The former Harvard College Disability Alliance faded out of existence once its leaders graduated. Very few dorms in Harvard Yard are fully accessible. Ableism is almost entirely absent from conversations about diversity and inclusion. Being disabled means facing prejudice and subconscious bias every day, being excluded from events, social gatherings, and opportunities, and feeling unwelcome in what is meant to be our home. As a result of the continued omission of our experiences, disabled students are surrounded by physical and systemic inaccessibility in every sphere of our lives at the College.
That’s why we founded the Harvard Undergraduate Disability Justice Club: to remind the Harvard community that we exist on campus. If the College wants to educate “future citizen leaders” as its mission statement proclaims, it must not only acknowledge that disabled people are an essential part of that population, but also demonstrate that we belong in this community through a commitment to accessibility in all aspects of University life.
Disability justice is a push towards accessibility and inclusion in all forms for disabled people of all identities. Disabled people make up the single largest minority group in the world. As of 2016, at least 19.4 percent of college students in the United States are disabled. It is also important to recognize that disability can happen without warning to anyone at any point in their life. This consideration is more urgent than ever given that a mass-disabling event is now occurring, with long Covid affecting up to 43 percent of Covid-19 survivors, according to some estimates. Disability justice is relevant to everyone, even if not everyone is aware that it is something we need to strive towards.
Prior to founding HUDJ, there was no opportunity for disabled students to connect and learn that we’re not alone in our experiences. It was difficult to find other disabled people on campus — we happened to meet each other through random interactions in classes, at events, or in the dining halls. There is no office or department that holds events where disabled students can get to know each other. The closest thing you could find at Harvard, prior to the pandemic, was the Accessible Education Office Test Center. Yes, the place where stressed-out disabled students silently took their exams was the closest thing to a “community center” we have ever had. Even the Office of BGLTQ Student Life has held more community-building events meant for disabled people than the AEO has. Rather than an affinity space, the AEO is a bureaucratic office that holds power over disabled students. Some of us have had only positive experiences with the AEO, but others have found it difficult to receive the accommodations and support that they need.
The AEO Test Center is a frustrating symbol of what we lack, but it’s also a promising reminder that more disabled people attend Harvard than one would think. The difficulty facing us is that there are many members of the Harvard community who would benefit from our advocacy but don’t currently realize it. After all, disability justice is not limited to visible markers of disability; it also includes neurodivergence, mental illnesses, and chronic illnesses — anything from depression to dyslexia. Disabled people are not a monolith, and not all disabled people choose to identify as disabled or even recognize that choice as an option. Some prefer to pass as abled to avoid stigma. Others arrive at Harvard knowing that they are disabled, and still others develop disabilities after arriving at Harvard and are left to their own devices to figure out how to advocate for themselves. There are disabled professors, staff, and graduate students as well — too often their presence at Harvard is overlooked.
We founded HUDJ to speak out against injustices as a community, rather than as individuals with complaints that are all too easy for Harvard administration to dismiss. With short-term goals such as advocating for Covid-19 policies that protect the safety of immunocompromised students, faculty, and staff, and long-term goals like establishing a Disability Studies department, HUDJ is striving to bring about critical change on Harvard’s campus that is long overdue.
Our aim is not only to create our own community, but also to work together to create long-term institutional policies that will better support students. We’re not asking for pity, and we’re not inspirational simply for taking up the space that we deserve. Instead, what we’re asking is that Harvard students, faculty, and administrators support us as allies in our fight for disability justice by making a conscious effort to ensure accessibility of classes, extracurriculars, and events; speaking out against inaccessibility and ableism on campus; and listening to and learning from us when we share our experiences and perspectives.
Harvard prides itself on being a national and global leader. It has the ability to set a powerful standard for the world that catalyzes change. It’s time for Harvard, both as an institution and as a community, to step up and take a prominent role in increasing accessibility and combating ableism on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This spring, for the fourth consecutive semester, Harvard undergraduates have been forced to select their classes without shopping week; that is, without the opportunity to sample and explore different courses before committing to any of them. Also this spring, for the second consecutive semester, our board sorely feels the loss of Harvard’s most delightful scheduling quirk.
We miss shopping week — and we aren’t alone.
Last term, in a markedly decisive  referendum, 96.46 percent of undergraduate voters voted to reinstate what was once a celebrated part of Harvard’s academic culture. The lopsided result wasn’t exactly unexpected, not for anyone loosely acquainted with students’ love for shopping week. In the past, 62 percent of our undergraduate peers have named shopping week as being significant in their decision to attend Harvard — a misleading if decisive factor, it now seems. Even our administration once touted the tradition as “priceless,” boasting about its merits within Harvard’s official news outlet and publishing a detailed, student-written ‘ode to shopping week’ on the University domain.
The hype was well warranted. Shopping week’s upsides have long been apparent to students, who frequently used the time to browse new and exciting courses without the commitment (and corollary anxiety) of having to enroll before setting foot in the class. In doing so, it offered Harvard undergraduates the rare opportunity to step, or at least peek, outside their comfort zones, to try out new academic endeavors without immediately having to assume any and all grade-related consequences.
Our peers could, for example, figure out whether their winter break fascination with philosophy was in fact worth pursuing or merely symptomatic of an unsustainable Kantian obsession. They could sit-in on friends’ classes only to discover a ‘gem’ hidden in some obscure department distant from their own, or discover courses that, despite lackluster syllabi, were brought to life by brilliant, lesser-known faculty.
Shopping for classes allowed us to try on different masks, to figure out what we wanted to study and who we wanted to be in an institution whose vertiginous pace rarely allows for self reflection. Shopping wasn’t just about how we structured the first few days of class, a logistical detail devoid of importance. Instead, it directly contributed to broadening student perspectives and sparking new interests — both of which are essential to the well-rounded liberal arts education that Harvard claims to embody.
Despite our continuous support of shopping week, we aren’t blind  to the difficulties that it poses to faculty and graduate student teaching fellows alike: Not knowing one’s class size, or, worse still, one’s exact terms of employment until a week into the semester is bound to be stressful. The extent to which the new course preview period will benefit those whom shopping week previously burdened, however, is questionable.
Currently, the preview period incentivizes deciding one’s classes based on horribly impersonal course previews and often-revised syllabi. Notably, the new policy also creates its own set of distinct problems: It is not, for example, accessible to students who may have obligations such as work or caring for family members during winter break, students without reliable internet connections at home, students that live in different time zones, or students traveling back to the United States. Even for those lucky enough to have unencumbered access, the course preview period encroaches on the hard-earned break of some of the busiest college bees in the country.
Given these complications, it’s hardly surprising that some students have taken to enrolling in many extra courses, some of which they will later drop, to create their own personal pseudo-shopping week. Others will likely wait until the very end of registration period to finalize their schedules. Yet these responses to the inadequacies of the course preview period seem likely to create exactly the same kind of chaotic uncertainty that made shopping week difficult for faculty and teaching fellows in the first place.
The only difference? Many professors assign work, give quizzes, make students purchase course materials, and critically, begin the process of sectioning classes in their first week. All of these realities make transferring classes, even in the first week, far from seamless — and decidedly not stress-free.
If Harvard cares about the needs of its students and its faculty, it must engage with community stakeholders to carefully and transparently study the benefits and disadvantages of shopping week, as well as the effects of the course preview period. While the suggestion to move course registration to the end of the previous semester might reduce uncertainty for faculty and teaching staff, it would place immense stress on students preparing for finals and distract classes they still have not finished. The suspension of a key Harvard tradition demands, at a minimum, a temporary alternative that is genuinely beneficial for all involved. We don’t believe course registration should be a zero-sum tug-of-war between students and faculty.
We do believe, however, that education at Harvard should be a positive-sum experience in which we are able to continuously learn and improve — shopping week helped us do just that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Public Health Department released findings on Wednesday reporting that the peak of Omicron cases in Cambridge passed on Jan. 5, though Derrick L. Neal, CPHD director, reminded residents that they are “not out of the woods yet.”
The report’s findings, which relied on wastewater analysis, were consistent with Cambridge’s Jan. 8 record high seven-day average of new Covid-19 infections.
“If you look at the case trends for Harvard and MIT since early December, you’ll see that university trends followed a similar pattern as Cambridge and the state, with the peak of Harvard and MIT infections occurring in early January,” the CPHD wrote in an emailed statement.
Amid the nationwide spread of the Omicron variant in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance to state that following a positive Covid-19 test result, individuals should observe a five-day isolation period — a departure from its previous recommendation of ten days — and may leave isolation if symptoms resolve by day five.
Cambridge’s guidance includes a strong emphasis on testing during and beyond this isolation period.
“The Cambridge Public Health Department strongly recommends antigen testing on day 6 of the isolation period because people with COVID-19 can be infectious after day 5, even if they are feeling better,” CHPD wrote in its email.
“At this point in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important that people have easy access to testing through home test kits than it is to count every case,” the statement continues.
Last month, the city also announced strengthened indoor masking guidelines and a temporary shift to remote meetings for all public city meetings, excluding those of the City Council and its committees.
During a Jan. 24 City Council meeting, Neal, who serves as the city's chief public health officer, provided updates on the state of the pandemic in Cambridge.
“The level of infection is still great with the drop that we're anticipating and that we’re witnessing at this time,” Neal said.
“Cases are still higher than they were in any other previous surge that we’ve had in Cambridge,” Neal added. “Our analogy that we use in the office today is literally like going 150 miles an hour to around 100 miles an hour.”
During the update, Neal emphasized that the future of Covid-19 in Cambridge – as well as throughout the country – was shifting from a pandemic response to an endemic one.
“The phrase ‘pandemic to endemic’ is an acknowledgment that we can’t defeat Covid, rather Covid will become an endemic disease,” he said. “This means that it will be with us indefinitely.”
During the meeting, Anna Kaplan, CPHD’s director of epidemiology and data services, said she expects it to take “several weeks” before the city experiences a level of transmission that the CDC defines as “substantial,” rather than its current level of “high.”
“I’d like to see us, from an epidemiology perspective, firmly in the moderate or low category – honestly probably in the low category, given the density of our city – before we can feel a little more like we’re in that endemic versus pandemic area,” she added.
Councilors responded to Neal’s presentation with both hope and apprehension about the uncertain future of Covid-19.
“I’m happy to see that you added some more testing availability and that the hour-long lines are not happening anymore,” Councilor Mark C. McGovern said during the meeting. “My fear is that there will be at some point again.”
McGovern filed a policy order on Jan. 10 – which was unanimously adopted by the Council – calling upon the city manager and other city departments to develop a report on how to increase testing availability for Cambridge residents.
Neal wrote in the CPHD’s emailed statement that he acknowledges the city’s keenness to return to business as usual.
“We have been living with COVID-19 for over two years, and it has been a tumultuous, stressful time. Pandemic fatigue is real. College students want a return to normalcy—we all do,” he wrote. “While we can’t change the fact that the virus is still spreading in the community and infection rates are still high, we can make a mental shift in our thinking.”
“We can acknowledge that the situation is improving,” he added. “Meanwhile, students should keep taking actions that keep them from getting the virus and spreading it to others, which includes vaccination and wearing high-quality masks indoors.”

Harvard will reopen its undergraduate dining halls with socially distanced seating beginning on Tuesday, the Dean of Students Office announced Monday night.
“We are pleased to announce that starting at breakfast on Tuesday, February 1, we will begin to offer limited, socially distant dining in residential spaces,” Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 wrote in an email to undergraduates.
Harvard announced in mid-December that all campus dining halls would shift to exclusively grab-and-go dining to “reduce community transmission” before students left for winter break. The move came as Harvard faced its largest surge of Covid-19 cases during the fall semester.
All dining halls will continue providing takeaway containers and disposable utensils for students who choose to take their meals to go, per the email.
Brandt also outlined the guidelines students must follow when sitting in the dining halls to limit the spread of Covid-19. Seats are limited to those who are actively eating, and affiliates are encouraged to limit the time they spend in the dining hall to allow others a place to eat. Chairs will be set up to give six feet of space between each diner.
“If compliance with testing and masking remain high and case numbers are manageable, we hope to ease restrictions soon and shift to regular seating,” Brandt wrote.
In the last seven days, the University reported 291 Covid-19 cases and a positivity rate of 0.79 percent, according to its testing dashboard Monday. The number of positive cases is down from 451 the week before.
While the grab-and-go dining policy was in place for the first week of classes, some Quad students — who are often unable to return to their House in between classes — struggled with finding places to eat indoors. To accommodate Quad students, Harvard opened Ticknor Lounge, CGIS Cafe, and the William James basement as dining areas.
On Monday, many upperclassman dining halls, including Adams, Currier, and Kirkland House, began setting up tables and chairs for socially distanced dining. In Adams, four chairs have been placed at the far corners of each table to ensure that all seats are six feet apart. Currier House positioned a chair at either end of its tables.
Kirkland has arranged its dining hall to restrict seating to one chair per table. A standing sign reminds students not to reconfigure the seating and to wear a mask when not eating.

A 30-year-old woman died in an apparent suicide Sunday at the Harvard T station.
The woman, whose identity has not been revealed, was pronounced dead after first responders were called to the scene at 5:24 p.m. Sunday, the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office said. The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority tweeted later that evening that a section of Red Line service was halted due to “a person under a train.”
The Middlesex DA is investigating the incident, but no foul play is suspected, according to Marcela Dwork, a spokesperson for the office.
Richard Sullivan, the MBTA Transit Police Department superintendent, wrote in an email Monday morning that the woman’s death was an “intentional act.”
Red Line service was halted for over five hours Sunday as first responders swarmed the T station, which sits in the middle of Harvard Square. MBTA Transit Police, Cambridge Police, Cambridge Fire, and area emergency medical services responded to the incident.
Rail service was halted in both directions until roughly 10:35 p.m.
Shuttles replaced T service between the Alewife and Park Street stations. Riders reported delays and confusion resulting from the stoppages. In some cases, passengers waited for over an hour in freezing temperatures for shuttle service.

The National Academy of Sciences awarded Harvard Kennedy School professor John P. Holdren the Public Welfare Medal, its highest honor, on Wednesday.
Holdren first joined the Kennedy School as a professor in 1996 but left in 2009 to serve as former President Barack Obama’s Science Advisor. He held the position for almost the entirety of the Obama administration, making him the role’s longest occupant since World War II. Afterward, he returned to HKS in 2017.
The National Academy of Sciences said in a press release it was presenting the medal to Holdren as an acknowledgment of “his many years of work on behalf of science.” The Academy presents the award annually “to honor extraordinary use of science for the public good.”
Holdren said he was “absolutely delighted” to receive the award.
“Obviously, it’s great to have this kind of recognition,” he said. “It’s an award that a number of people I admire and greatly respect have received in the past, so my gratitude getting the award is amplified by the people who got it before me.”
“I don’t know if I deserve it, but I’ll take it,” he added.
Marcia K. McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, wrote in a press release that Holdren was an “outstanding and effective” civil servant.
“John Holdren has more than fulfilled the call to ‘restore science to its rightful place,’ as he was charged to do by President Obama,” McNutt said. “He has helped shape sound national policy on everything from climate change to international nuclear arms control, and his efforts to ensure the strength of our scientific enterprise will reverberate for generations to come.”
In a press release, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote Holdren was a model for how to effectively unite academia and civil service.
“He has been more than a beloved teacher,” Elmendorf said. “He has shown what it can mean when science is translated into policies and practice that serve all of us.”
Holdren was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, when HKS persuaded him to swap coasts in 1996. Joseph S. Nye Jr., who was Dean of the Kennedy School at that time, praised Holdren for the impact he has since had on the institution.
“John has been a wonderful colleague who has enriched our lives at the Kennedy School at the same time that he has made the world a better place,” Nye said.
Though Holdren, who is now 77 years old, retired from teaching in June 2021, he intends to keep working as a researcher, focusing on several topics in his academic wheelhouse.
“I continue to be the principal investigator or co-principal investigator on six different grants,” he said. “On the issues that I care about, I'm not thinking of retiring from the fray. I'm going to continue to be active in working on these problems.”

Jody Freeman, a professor at Harvard Law School and the former energy and climate change counselor for the Obama administration, discussed the major legislative and judicial barriers to the Biden administration’s climate agenda during a virtual talk Monday.
Throughout his time in office, President Joe Biden has attempted to reverse the Trump administration’s climate deregulation and restore signature climate policies from the Obama administration, such as the Paris Climate Accords.
The Biden administration, however, still faces legislative and judicial challenges to progress on climate issues such as regulating carbon emissions from the power, oil, and gas industries, Freeman said.
Freeman said that one major obstacle to reducing carbon emissions is the political feasibility of implementing a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system.
“You want to make carbon costly,” she said. “I’m not an economist, but I’m pretty confident that if you don’t price the thing you’re trying to reduce, it makes it harder to reduce.”
A carbon tax is a fee imposed on the burning of carbon-based fuels, while a cap-and-trade system places a limit on the overall level of carbon emissions a firm can release. Each policy aims to reduce pollution by regulating the price or quantity of carbon emissions.
Freeman said the Supreme Court could also create barriers to climate regulation.
“The Court will not be shy about its skepticism toward broad government regulation,” Freeman said.
Freeman explained how the Court’s ruling on a case involving the Clean Air Act of 1970 — which authorized the federal government to enforce greenhouse gas emission limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency — could limit the EPA’s regulation authority.
Though the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the EPA’s authority to limit pollution under the Clean Air Act, a ruling in favor of power plants could hamper the Biden administration’s efforts to curb emissions.
“In the world of climate change, we’re waiting to see what the Supreme Court may do to clip the wings of the Environmental Protection Agency,” Freeman said.
“If that were to happen, we'd be left in a world, in the United States anyway, where the Congress is largely inactive on climate change,” she added.
Though judicial and legislative roadblocks could thwart Biden’s climate agenda, Freeman said it is important to pay attention to new university-led initiatives such as the Roosevelt Project.
MIT’s Roosevelt Project aims to plot “a path to a low carbon economy in a way that promotes high quality job growth, minimizes worker and community dislocation, and harnesses the benefits of energy technologies for regional economic development,” according to the project's website. The project’s team includes administrators and researchers from MIT, Harvard, Boise State, and Carnegie Mellon.
Freeman said that she expected “big things” from Harvard as well.
“It's an amazing amount of productivity, scholarship, research, and concrete solutions being developed across Harvard University,” she said.

The intensity of Saturday’s storm left roads slippery, and fans of Harvard women’s squash  uncertain as to whether they would be able to watch the No. 1 Crimson (11-0, 6-0 Ivy) take on its rivals No. 4 Yale (6-3) Sunday afternoon.
To the delight of spectators, while New England was still reeling from the monster blizzard that blanketed multiple states in layers of snow, another powerful force was confirmed to be scheduled on the courts of the Harvard University Squash Center.
For the past six years, Harvard’s women have dominated the college squash scene in a storm of rackets and rubber balls, winning five consecutive Ivy League titles and nine out of the last eleven College Squash Association (CSA) championships.
Sunday afternoon’s showdown marked Harvard’s sixth and final Ivy League match-up this season. More importantly, the game also presented the Crimson with an opportunity to cap off a perfect league record and claim the Ivy League crown for the sixth year in a row.
Initial action saw Harvard secure four swift match victories over Yale, including a convincing win from its graduating captain, senior Hana Moataz, which put them up 3-0 in the overall point contest.
First-year Habiba Eldafrawy rebounded from a loss in her first game to take her next three games, and the match, to boost the Crimson up 4-0.
However, the Bulldogs responded, taking two wins in the next collection of matches to apply pressure to a red-hot Harvard team.
Though Harvard’s Ivy League title seemed inevitable, as the Crimson held leads in all of its games at the time, first-year Brecon Welch made it official when she smacked a tactical backhand off the left wall to score and win the third, deciding game of her match. It was only then that the crowd of fellow athletes, coaches, and fans could celebrate.
As she exited the court, Welch had no idea that she had just claimed the fifth and deciding win in the race to nine points against Yale, and along with that, an Ivy League trophy.
The win came on a very special night for Moataz and fellow senior Amina Yousry, two graduating athletes whose accomplishments in the squash program were celebrated prior to the match thanks to support from a season-high number of fans and family in the stands.
Moataz and Yousry have had very successful tenures with Harvard squash. Both players were key contributors to Ivy League championship-winning teams in each of their three years with the program.
The Murr Center was swallowed by cheers as the Crimson hoisted the Ivy League trophy. League victory finalized the accomplishment of the lofty goal that the team set itself at the beginning of the season.
Harvard has enjoyed a long tradition of squash success, and the 2022 team has been no exception, being pushed to 5-4 only once despite facing other top-ten opponents eight times in eleven matches.
At the forefront of this successful season, but residing humbly at the back of the victory parade was head coach Mike Way. Way has distinguished himself once again in his twelfth season with the Crimson as a knowledgeable coach who won U.S. Squash Coach of the Year in 2017, but what has consistently set the Englishman apart is his attention to detail and caring nature.
Way’s extensive commitment to his team manifests itself between games, when he provides athletes with valuable insights on their performance, and after, when he can still be seen retrieving exhausted athletes’ forgotten water bottles from three courts away to preserve their energy. His level of investment in his team has proven to be a key factor in Harvard’s consistent successes.
In addition to the Ivy League accolades, Sunday’s win marks the Crimson’s 93rd straight CSA single-game victory, as well as its 45th Ivy League single-game victory. It will look to extend the former streak to 94 as it welcomes Stanford to the Murr Center on Feb. 5.
With its sixth Ivy title secured, Harvard women’s squash looks ahead to the CSA Championship on Feb. 25, where it hopes to earn its 28th national title.

With temperatures dropping and stress levels rising, many of us could use extra endorphins right now. But we also know it’s much easier to spend the next 10 minutes scrolling through Instagram instead of walking over to the MAC, let alone spending the next 30 minutes half-jogging, half-walking on a treadmill with a mask on. So we’re here to show you some gym-free ways to get your sweat on and help your New Year’s resolutions survive the start of the spring semester.
Forget Something In Your Dorm Room 
We all know the feeling of finally getting to your destination five minutes early for once, only to realize that you left your Harvard ID on your desk so now you can’t enter. The bright side? That 20-minute round trip back to your dorm, including three flights of stairs thanks to Harvard’s classic architecture, will get your heart pumping.
Switch Your Concentration to Engineering
This is for the most dedicated of readers. Be prepared for not only long psets (and long pset sob sessions), but also long walks just to get to class. The appeal of sleeping in may have never seemed higher. But rest assured: if you actually make the effort to get yourself over to the SEC five times a week, you’ll be getting your steps in. Bonus points for trying to sprint over from the Science Center Plaza without the shuttle with only 15-minutes between classes.
Pick the Top Bunk
Especially for those with low ceilings and cramped rooms, finding a way to jump into the top bunk without hitting your head or falling off is a full-body workout, helping you work on your flexibility, creativity, and muscle strength all at once. At this point in the semester, burning an extra 10 calories each time you climb into your bed for those ~quick~ naps can add up fast.
Make Friends In the Quad
After years of being told that getting quadded will be the end of all your non-Quad friendships, imagine if being a Quadling could actually make a friendship more attractive to a River Person. With your new mindset focused on staying active, take those half an hour walks from your dorm to theirs as an opportunity to self-reflect, vibe with good music, and exercise, instead of cursing the geography of our campus.
Look for Love with Datamatch 
The easiest way to get your heart racing? Meet up with a complete stranger, who is supposedly guaranteed to be your soulmate. Pro tip: start mentally listing out their negative traits like a generic taste in music or inability to talk about anything but their summer internship at *Insert Boring Tech Company* to get your heart rate up even more.
Carry the Weight of the World’s Expectations
Whether from your professor, your parents, your hometown, your adviser, your friends, or, most probably, yourself, striving to meet expectations seems to constantly be at the forefront of any Harvard student’s mind. These pressures are not a light load, but carrying them everywhere you go—to the shower, to the dining hall, to office hours—must burn some calories, right?
Regardless of how you get your exercise in, make sure you do move around and get some fresh air. It’s too early in the semester to spend your week switching back-and-forth between your desk and your bed, no matter how tempting that may seem with grab-and-go dining and weather that is ~crisp~ at best. Even just walking around outside for 10 minutes or taking a quick study break to learn a new Tik Tok dance with your suitemates can do wonders for your physical and mental health.
