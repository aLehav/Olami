After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students across the world are anxiously waiting to hear how their colleges and universities will re-open this fall — and if schools re-open, what steps they will take to keep us safe. Almost all Harvard classes will be virtual, but other local schools, such as Boston University, Boston College, and Tufts, plan to hold some in-person classes. While Harvard and MIT rightfully challenged the administration’s cruel rule threatening international students, Harvard appears to be supporting another proposal that endangers students in a different way: corporate liability protections that would let schools reopen without critical safety measures in place, putting students, campus workers, and the broader community at risk.
Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), plan to introduce legislation providing corporations with legal protection from lawsuits related to COVID-19. That would make it more difficult to hold corporations, including the Harvard Corporation, accountable if they endanger lives by reopening without adequate safety precautions. In Sen. McConnell’s words, this “major package of COVID-related liability reforms” would “create a legal safe harbor” for businesses and schools. Employers and universities that re-open must do so safely, and corporate immunity will remove critical incentives to do so. Yet the American Association of Universities, a higher education membership organization, is leading the charge for this dangerous legislation — and Harvard is a founding member.
Corporate immunity would make campuses far more dangerous for those who return, with international students — who may have no option but to remain on campus — bearing the greatest risk. Students must feel safe in their learning environment, especially after being abruptly evicted last spring. Yet this legislation takes the heat off universities— and leaves students and workers with seemingly little recourse if their school fails to adopt basic precautions like sanitizing classrooms and guaranteeing workers’ access to personal protective equipment.
Previous attempts to grant corporate immunity highlight the risks. Utah, for example, passed similar state-level legislation in May. The very next day, a local paper reported that one Salt Lake City employer told employees not to follow public health guidance and required even those who tested positive for COVID-19 to report to work. Nearly half of the workers later tested positive. If universities are granted immunity, they run the risk of becoming the next hot-spots and driving local outbreaks beyond campus.
Liability shields could allow universities and other employers to flout worker safety laws without consequence. Liability shields impede courts as an avenue of redress, shifting the burden of protecting workers onto the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But OSHA citations have been nearly nonexistent during the pandemic – leaving workers unprotected. As with so much of the pandemic, this burden falls disproportionately on Black and brown workers, who are overrepresented in Harvard’s service workforce.
A recent Washington Post editorial advocates for protecting schools that implement scientifically sound safety efforts, but state law already offers precisely these protections. Sweeping immunity is unnecessary to re-open, as universities are already insulated from frivolous litigation. Tort law requires only “reasonable” safety precautions, like providing PPE and ensuring that students can socially distance in classrooms. Any good-faith reopening plan will likely meet this standard, which explains why the U.S. hasn’t seen a flood of lawsuits. The greatest number of COVID-related complaints have been filed by businesses over insurance coverage, with far fewer coming from employees or students. Thus, corporate immunity would only shield bad actors and employers who are acting unreasonably.
Instead, liability shields may create a race to the bottom, discouraging schools from spending more on health protections than the bare minimum to qualify for legal protections as they look to reduce spending anywhere possible to remain afloat. They will create risks for students, particularly those with underlying health conditions, who may be forced to decide between protecting their health or returning to campus. Even if these students choose to continue their studies virtually, they will face different learning environments while competing on the same grading curve and paying the same tuition – which will only exacerbate inequities.
Harvard should be working to make sure that everyone, including first-generation students, low-income students, and students of color can get equal access to education in the fall. Instead, Harvard is at least tacitly lending its support to lobbying for a corporate immunity proposal that would give America’s biggest corporations a license to kill workers and consumers. These days, institutions lobby through industry groups to avoid bad press — Harvard shouldn’t hide behind the American Association of Universities. If Harvard isn’t advocating for corporate immunity, the school should make its opposition clear to the community and to Congress. This is why the Harvard chapter of the People’s Parity Project has launched a petition to demand that Harvard oppose corporate immunity.
Universities should oppose liability shields and remain accountable for their environments. Yet many have done the opposite, deploying their resources to lobby Congress for immunity, while some employees go without vital personal protective equipment and students are denied tuition cuts.
If campuses re-open without the proper precautions, they will undermine efforts to curb COVID-19 and simultaneously delay a full return to in-person learning. As we have seen, a hasty return to normality leads to spikes in coronavirus cases. States that rushed to reopen are now issuing shutdown orders in a complete reversal. Congress must demand stronger safeguards for public health rather than rendering them optional.
As students, we could not be more eager to trade our Zoom calls for classrooms and ensure that our international peers can remain in the U.S. – but know we must do so safely to protect not only ourselves, but our immuno-compromised peers, the workers that keep the school running, and our broader communities. To ensure a safe campus, schools must go beyond the bare minimum – they must oppose corporate immunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the clock ticking in the 2020 Massachusetts Democratic United States Senate primary, incumbent U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and U.S. Representative Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.) struggled to meaningfully differentiate themselves Sunday night in a crucial debate.
With just over a month until the election, Kennedy and Markey — who have escalated attacks on one another in recent weeks — spent much of the forum squabbling over individual votes that they alleged were non-progressive and bickering about endorsements and time spent in the commonwealth.
What started as a social media spat reached the debate stage Sunday, as Kennedy went after Markey for his support of a bill that funded beds at immigration detention centers — only to have the charge turned around on him.
The bill in question — a 2013 Department of Homeland Security appropriations act — stands out as an unusual non-progressive vote from Markey, who sided at the time with House Republicans to maintain funding for more than 30,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds.
“Senator Markey voted with Republican immigration extremists to try to fight back against an Obama administration trying to decrease the number of detention beds,” Kennedy said — one in a laundry list of things in his opponent’s 37-year Congressional record that he said “deserves attention.”
In a video released by Kennedy last week, U.S. Reps. Juan C. Vargas (D-Calif.) and Linda T. Sánchez (D-Calif.) — both members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus — criticized Markey for the vote.
“We were betrayed,” Vargas said in the video.
Kennedy, however, voted for the provision, too, in a later omnibus spending package — albeit one that was supported by most Democrats, including the same members of the Hispanic Caucus.
“Give me a break, Congressman,” Markey said. “You took the same position.”
When the issue came up for a second time later in the debate, Kennedy took issue with Markey conflating the two votes.
“Senator Markey continues to try to muddy the waters so that he doesn’t have to respond to his vote,” Kennedy said, as his opponent scoffed on the right side of the split-screen. “He voted with Republican extremists against President Obama and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to try to actually provide more detention beds to house immigrants. That’s his vote.”
“It got put in there because it passed because people like Senator Markey voted for it to begin with,” Kennedy later added.
The debate — which was broadcast on NBC10 Boston, Telemundo Boston, and New England Cable News (NECN) — comes at a crucial time in the race. Though two more debates remain ahead of the September 1 primary, new voting regulations enacted amid the coronavirus crisis that will send every registered voter in the commonwealth an absentee ballot application have added urgency to the race, as many voters may cast ballots ahead of election day.
Kennedy and Markey also sparred over criminal justice reform, with Kenney accusing Markey of having “voted for mass incarceration” and knocking his past opposition to busing to integrate Boston public schools.
Markey said he was “proud” of his record on criminal justice reform, pointing to an endorsement from Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins and his advocacy of the Next Step Act, which would change sentencing guidelines and police training.
“We need fundamental criminal justice overhaul,” Markey said.
Markey also touted his support as a state legislator for a proposal brought by Bill Owens, the first African American elected to the state Senate, to create a state Senate district in a minority neighborhood.
Asked if they support defunding police departments, both candidates punted on specifics.
“We just have to change our system,” Markey said. “We don’t need more law enforcement, we need more prevention, we need more health care, we need more job training in our country.”
Kennedy faced questions regarding his past affiliation with the fraternity Kappa Alpha, which he was a member of as an undergraduate at Stanford University. Kennedy disaffiliated with KA — which previously referred to the confederate general Robert E. Lee as its “spiritual founder” on its website — last year.
“The chapter at Stanford had almost no relationship with the national organization and none of the behaviors or the traditions of that national organization,” Kennedy said.
“I wish I could go back and tell my 18-year-old me that that was going to be a mistake,” he added.
The two also had a spat over endorsements when NBC10 political reporter Alison King pressed Markey on the amount of time he spends in Massachusetts as opposed to his second home in Chevy Chase, Md. — an issue that has long dogged Markey and that Kennedy has capitalized on in previous debates.
Markey pointed to the endorsement of numerous mayors and elected officials from across the state, including Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh and others from Kennedy’s own district.
“Senator, of course they endorse you,” Kennedy said. “Most of them endorsed you before I got in this race. And that’s fine, that’s the way this goes. This race is not going to be won on endorsements.”
“Then don’t say that I’m not doing the job if those people with whom I’m partnering are endorsing me in this race,” Markey interjected.
Kennedy — the heir to one of America’s most prominent political families ever — portrayed himself as an outsider multiple times throughout the debate, accusing Markey of running on “the politics of the past.”
“This is why we need change,” Kennedy said. “Because it is a Washington thing to think that endorsements of elected officials means credibility and means success.”
