After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During Charles Darwin’s voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle, he realized that a supposed “ostrich” his shipmates had just shot, cooked, and eaten was a rare species of Rhea he had been searching for. He scrambled to collect the bones and managed to recreate the specimen for display in the Zoological Society. This story would likely resonate with artist Mark Dion, whose cluttered sculptures adopt the methods of the naturalist to comment on some of humans’ oblivious interactions with nature. The Institute of Contemporary Art organized 30 years of his art into the breathtakingly immersive survey “Mark Dion: Misadventures of a 21st-Century Naturalist.”
With a cynical twist on Darwin’s curiosity, he often seizes objects and specimens seen as trash and presents them, in cabinets and display cases, as worthy of close examination. The exhibit begins on a confusingly bright note. “Toys ‘R’ U.S. (When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth)” is a recreation of a lively, familiar-feeling child’s bedroom in which every toy and clothing item is adorned with dinosaurs. Its portrayal of obsession is only slightly exaggerated. The underlying criticism of how we teach nature to children is not immediately apparent behind the bright colors, and the work begs a long, ultimately self-deprecating look from its viewers.
In “The Department of Marine Animal Identification of the City of San Francisco (Chinatown Division),” as in many of his works, Dion play-acts the role of a naturalist. His process recalls Darwin’s Rhea discovery—Dion collected fish from markets in San Francisco and worked to identify them using books. The artwork itself is a recreation of the environment in which he worked: his books on an overflowing desk and the fish specimens lined up in jars. In this artwork, he has realized and redefined a potential for naturalism in urban life.
Each work in the show contains infinite details to disgust and delight, and the journey into the rest of the massive exhibit both clarifies and complicates Dion’s views. The sharpest visual contrast from “Toys ‘R’ U.S.” comes in the unsettling “Killers Killed,” in which Dion covered taxidermied animals detested by civilizations with tar and hung their bodies from a tree, conjuring images of lynching. Another one of the most glaringly bleak sculptures is “Cabinet of Marine Debris,” which resembles a cabinet of beautiful ceramics from afar but is actually junk that he collected from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
Contrasting, or perhaps highlighting, the feeling of pessimism in the art is a wonder at nature that verges on hope. The museum invites visitors to step into an aviary entitled “The Library for the Birds of New York/The Library for the Birds of Massachusetts,” with live zebra finches and canaries fluttering above a tree lined with books on ornithology, which the birds have defecated on. It is at once mystically fairytale-like and gritty. Though delicate, the birds are presented with a power to ignore human intervention.
“Landfill,” too, portrays resilient animals. In a display case imitating those in natural history museums, taxidermied animals including a seagull and a pigeon appear to thrive among human waste. Like in “Toys ‘R’ U.S.,” every manufactured object refers to an animal, from Camel cigarettes to beef broth. However, the format of the museum display case once again emphasizes the impossibility of humans’ rectifying the environmental ruin they have caused.
In Dion’s work, no natural object is left untouched by a human hand, and images from nature pervade even the most consumerist aspects of civilization. 30 years of Dion’s art summarize a staggering range of emotional and intellectual reactions to this collision of worlds and preserve, before it can be discarded, a complicated moment in environmental history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students often complain about lacking time: not enough time to sleep, study or join extracurriculars. Meanwhile, we live in a university with a time of its own. With “Harvard time,” we are allowed to arrive to most events and classes seven minutes late. Jokes about “running on Harvard time” notwithstanding, the system is shockingly efficient. When, as The Crimson reported last spring might happen, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences eliminates Harvard time, the school will be making a grave mistake, and those complaints about the lack of time will get far worse.
The new system comes as the University prepares to facilitate the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ move to its Allston campus in 2020. “Harvard time,” however, is far more than just a unique facet of Harvard that should be relegated to history. It maximizes the efficiency of students’ schedules. It minimizes potential conflicts between classes and extracurriculars. It should survive the move.
The historical origins of our seven-minute passing time are hazy. Its earliest mention in the archives of The Crimson seems to be in 1951. Yet its entrenchment on the campus is clear. That classes begin seven minutes late is taken as a given. Meetings are expected to start on Harvard time as well. For lunch plans or interviews, one will typically see “beginning on time” as a notifier that the normal fashion will be broken. Nostalgia, however, is not a good enough reason to save our quirk of scheduling. Efficiency is.
The ingenuity of Harvard time is in allowing meetings and classes to be placed back-to-back, endlessly. By building in an assumed passing time at the start of everything, we can put our classes and extracurricular meetings in blocks abutting one another. The new class scheduling system adopted by FAS changes all that. It staggers expanded 75-minute class blocks with 15 minutes of passing time in between. It also offsets times for classes on the Allston campus. The inefficiency it will produce is illustrated by comparing schedules before and after the change.
Ordinarily, 12 hours is the least amount of time spent in class per week for a full course load, given the normal minimum of four courses meeting for three hours each per week. Right now, one could theoretically fit all four classes on just Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., leaving the entire rest of the week free. Those 12 hours include passing time. Harvard time facilitates this. Though, of course, many courses do not fit these standard lengths and time slots, considering the minimum is helpful.
Under the new system, those 12 hours expand to at least 17 hours and 15 minutes, including passing time, assuming professors use the expanded time given for lectures and sections. Under the new system, putting all classes on the same days would now consume a 10:15 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. block three days a week. Compare that to the 10:00 a.m. to  2:00 p.m. block under the old system. Even if we take out the extra time spent in class (three hours), the new system wastes two hours and 15 minutes per week, just in the time between classes. This might not sound like much. It is.
Harvard College has about 6,700 students. Each semester, they spend about 13 weeks in classes. If you multiply this by the two hours and 15 minutes wasted per week, the new plan will destroy, each semester, the equivalent of more than 22 years of student time—22 years wasted by building in a time block between classes. Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw would be horrified at the opportunity cost.
It does not end there. The College has more than 400 student organizations. They meet frequently, often in the evenings, typically working around the schedules of their members. A glance at many students’ Google calendars—blocked off in their typical, color-coded fashion—will reveal the extent of this involvement. Here the inefficiency continues.
If you think scheduling events is challenging now, just wait until classes are structured in 75 minutes blocks interspersed with longer seminars, offset Allston campus classes, and blocks of 15 minutes for travel between classes. Chaos will ensue. You will long for the simple days of our 53 minute meetings beginning after the seven minutes of Harvard time. Club meetings will push further into the evenings and weekends, trying to escape the creep and expansion of the academic schedule. Irregular class start and end times will make those doodle polls and when2meets ever more ubiquitous and maddening.
In sum, everything will get harder. Those lunch plans with friends? Try juggling staggered 75 minute class blocks at random times. Even students in SEAS will see little benefit. Walking to the Allston campus from the Yard will take, according to Google Maps, about 20 minutes. The new system builds in travel times of 45 minutes before and 75 minutes after Allston classes. What are you supposed to do with 15 minutes spent waiting in a classroom for class to start? Better for the Allston classes to start, perhaps, 15 minutes after the hour, operate on Harvard time as normal, and allow everything to work accordingly.
Your meetings, lunch plans, and study time reap great benefits from Harvard time. It is so much more than a quirky facet of our school. It is an ingenious mechanism for allowing flexibility in scheduling and for minimizing wasted time. As ugly as its :07 start times and 53 minute periods may seem, its effect are truly beautiful. Harvard time will be sorely missed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is clear that Harvard—as a university and as a group of people—is affected by the political issues of the day. We believe it is of great importance for Harvard’s presidential search committee to actively consider the ability of any successor to University President Drew G. Faust to lobby on political issues, primarily those affecting the Harvard student body, as one of their primary characteristics for selection. Harvard may be going through a presidential shift, but it is not likely that the country will be doing the same.
We also ask that the search committee find someone who will continue, if not ramp up, efforts to put the needs of students first. Harvard is an institution that accepts students from all over the world with a diverse range of interests, some are of whom are especially vulnerable under this Trump administration. The next president should be able to guarantee resources and  protection for all students regardless of their background.
In particular, we urge the presidential search committee to find a president who will continue its commitment to immigrant rights. Given that Harvard accepts students regardless of immigration statuses and that this administration has threatened students and their families with travel bans restricting members of the Harvard community, the University must do its part to stand up for their rights. We have seen the support for undocumented students as their futures remain uncertain.
Our students are supposed to be students first. They should not have to worry about whether or not they or their families will be able to stay or be allowed into this country.
Moreover, we call on the future president to continue to push for the best educational opportunities for students. In light of the amount of funding that Harvard receives from the government, as well as the threat to its continuation, it is clear research funding will remain—as it should—an important focus of Harvard’s D.C. lobbying efforts.
Finally, we believe presidential search committee must find a president who will continue the commitment to diversity at Harvard. We have seen the University come under attack directly on matters of affirmative action with lawsuits and threats from the Department of Justice. Administrators should do their part, in Cambridge and in Washington, to ensure that students do not have to question their place at Harvard.
We recognize the limits to the President’s lobbying power as the head of a non-profit organization, but we know that there are many efforts that can be taken on in the name of our students. Past presidents and Faust have made advocacy a priority and devoted significant resources to it. Indeed, Faust has been especially active since Trump came into office as she has rightly recognized the threats posed by this administration. This is the time for Harvard to be active in shaping the policies of our nation as best as it can, not the time for it to retreat into the Ivory Tower of academia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: When I arrived on campus more than two years ago, I realized quickly that I did not belong. There’s no romantic way of saying this. I was one of only a handful of Latinx students in a 75-person class marketed as an introduction to the humanities. My finances gave me anxiety as I juggled a part-time job with an academic workload beyond anything I’d attempted before. I was strung between two worlds—Harvard and home were further apart than simply the 3,000 miles I’d trekked to get here.
Zoe: When I was little, I would listen to Spanish beautifully and effortlessly flow from my grandparents’ lips. When I would see them, I would do my best to mimic the songs they were singing, trying to roll my r’s and remember to make the “y” sound for “ll.” At the age of five, I hadn’t yet been taught to be embarrassed. I can only remember panicking when my grandma yelled for the escoba and I brought her a pan, only to find out she wanted the broom. I could feel sentences forming in my mind when I saw her, with the holes remaining unfilled by the words I had never been taught.
R: Eventually, I found the Latinx community on campus. Fuerza Latina meetings almost felt like home. The classmates I met there understood what it meant to be the only brown face in a white place. They worked ten or more hours per week. Spanglish slipped from their lips, naturally and unapologetically, the way I wished it would come from mine. So I desperately wanted to be a part of their club, one that prioritized melanin over whiteness and stories of struggle over those of wealth.
Z: By 11, my Spanish was as broken as my hope I would be able to speak it fluently one day. As the token Latina of my majority-white middle school on the nice side of town, I received the nickname “Dora” when I cut my hair short. I was considered the sole representative of my poor, tanned community, an expert in all things Latinx. They didn’t know how much of a fraud I truly was, coming from a place that equated speaking Spanish with being Latina.
R: Yet, as desperately as I wanted to belong, I did not feel authentic. I soon realized that a large portion of those involved in the Latinx community—and the majority of people who’ve led the Latinx organizations in recent memory—have been first-generation students on full financial aid. I myself am first-generation and Harvard was my cheapest option for college after I received substantial financial aide. But because my income level was above that deemed low-income, I felt as if I was intruding on a space that wasn’t mine.
I felt that the authentic Latinxs, the proper heirs to those spaces, were those who grew up in communities where almost everyone was Latinx. I went to a high school that was over 60 percent Asian American, and the majority of Latinx people I knew were my extended family members. I did not fit into what I’d convinced myself was the archetype for a Harvard Latino. When I imagined an authentic Latino, I did not picture the bitter brown boy in the mirror.
Z: “Aren’t you ashamed? How can you consider yourself Mexican?” someone asked me after finding out I couldn’t speak Spanish. I stayed silent, because I was ashamed of feeling like a failure because of the words I never learned and the sentences I always messed up. “That’s not how you say that,” my family would tell me. I could hear the American accent transforming my words from authentic to outsider, when my tanned skin should have meant I was the real deal instead of a disappointingly false advertisement. It was only reinforced with every person who looked at me with a confused face when I had to explain why I didn’t understand all of the words they’d say, a face that was accompanied by the silent question, “how, if you look like that?” I spent my entire life being stripped of my Latinidad with an intensity that often came from other Latinxs who couldn’t conceptualize that my cultural identity wasn’t founded in being taught how to speak the language perfectly. When I thought of a true Latina, I didn’t think of myself.
Z+R: A quick look at the Latinx community here at Harvard exposes the lies we’ve all been taught. Black, native, and Asian Latinx students have a right to embrace their identity. Whether a student speaks English or Spanish or Portuguese, they have an equal stake in Latinidad. Those who seek to police our community have failed to learn that the Latinx identity is not something that fits into a box or a neat list of descriptors.
The next time you wonder if you’re Latinx enough, or authentic enough, remember: You are. You are. You are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former CBS Chief Washington Correspondent Bob L. Schieffer spoke about the challenges facing journalists in the wake of the 2016 presidential election at the Kennedy School Wednesday.
Schieffer, who published a book this year on recent developments in media, discussed the need for the press to reconnect with voters on an individual level. He also spoke of social media’s effect on political discourse and the most recent election.
“With the coming of social media...it was an election that was not really about the issues, it was more about attitudes,” Schieffer, a former “Face the Nation” moderator, said. “In every way, this was an election unlike anything that we’ve had.”
Schieffer said voters from rural areas in particular are more likely to resort to Facebook and social media feeds for their news since newspapers or other news services were potentially not as readily accessible for them.
Schieffer recalled a rally for then-candidate Donald Trump that he had attended in South Carolina during the 2016 election campaign. He said supporters cited Trump’s “honesty” as a large reason for their support and said Trump spoke in a language that was easy for them to understand.
“He did what Hillary Clinton was never able to do. He crafted a message that cut through all the chatter,” Schieffer said. “He told them they would not be forgotten.”
Schieffer also lamented that the “best and brightest” were turning away from politics and that public opinion toward the electoral process has soured, a phenomenon he attributed to deep political polarization since the election.
“When I was a little boy, my grandmother was absolutely convinced that I was going to grow up to be president of the United States,” Schieffer said. “How long has it been since you heard anybody say, ‘I hope my child grows up to be a politician?’”
Discussing recent clashes between the Trump administration and several media organizations, Schieffer spoke of the differing responsibilities of journalists and politicians: A politician delivers a message to the public, while a journalist fact-checks that message.
“If [journalists] do that right, it’s as important to a democracy as the right to vote,” he said. “When people try to undermine the media in this country...I think they are doing a disservice.”
Schieffer added that he believes most journalists go into the job for good reasons.
“The majority of reporters I know, the majority of editors I know are simply hardworking people who are trying to get the story...and get it right,” he said.

The three-year renewal of Adams House will progress in stages, with some students remaining in the House while others live in nearby swing housing, according to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.
In previous House renewal projects, every resident of the House has lived in apartments in the Square while constructed continued. But because Adams House consists of three main buildings, students will not necessarily need to leave as Harvard renews different parts of the House. Smith also said that the Adams dining hall—one of the most popular on campus—will likely remain open during the academic year during construction.
“The design’s not done, but we’ll do more like we did with Leverett House where we did the dining hall during the summers and not during the academic year,” he said. “So the students were able to use the dining hall the entire time.”
While construction plans are not final, Smith said that Claverly Hall—one of the three Mt. Auburn buildings that makes up Adams House—could be renewed while the other buildings stay open.
“For all intents and purposes, it doesn’t look any different for the residents of Adams House when they are walking from one building instead of Claverley,” Smith said, referring to the swing housing apartments next to Adams House.
Smith said he has been working with the Faculty Deans and students of Adams on the plans for the revamped House. Among other changes, Smith said that Adams’s historic Pool Theater will likely remain in some form in the final design.
“I can guess with high probability that we won’t remove the Pool Theater, but we’ll maybe update it and do it differently to make it more handicap accessible and other sorts of things that probably are not true today,” he said.
Adams is the latest of Harvard’s Neo-Georgian Houses to be renewed. Lowell House construction, which began this June, is progressing on schedule and on budget, according to Smith.
Only Eliot and Kirkland Houses—which Smith said last year will be difficult to renew because they share a kitchen—remain. Smith said that the plan has been to finish the Neo-Georgian Houses before other renewals, though he said the plans are not set in stone.
“We would like to do them next, but I don’t yet have a plan for them,” he said.
While the Quad Houses and Mather will not be left out of House renewal project, Smith said those Houses would be addressed in “phase two.”
“We’re going to eventually touch all of the Houses,” Smith said “Who knows? Maybe Mather House will be done in some way but we haven’t done any work yet.”
The House Renewal project, which began in 2013 with Quincy House’s Stone Hall, has historically lagged behind other buckets in Harvard’s capital campaign, which has now raised $8 billion. Smith confirmed that fundraising for House renewal will continue even after the campaign ends in 2018.
“The project was always going to run longer than this campaign,” Smith said. “So we’re raising a chunk of money in this campaign but we were always going to raise more because the project is going to need more money.”

The Institute of Politics may have stripped Chelsea Manning of her visiting fellowship last month, but that did not stop her from coming to Cambridge and meeting with Harvard students.
In a small, unpublicized event held at the Democracy Center on Oct. 3,  Manning met with around 30 students from organizations including the Kennedy School’s Progressive Organizing Committee and the Harvard Trans Task Force.
“Her perspective is badly needed both at Harvard and across the country, and Harvard is worse off without her as a fellow,” Noah R. Wagner ’18, who attended the event, said.
The group sat around in a circle, with some students on the floor, according to Trans Task Force member Lily M. Velona ’18, who described the event as “a conversation” with Manning.
Velona said the group discussed topics including U.S. military tactics, Manning’s experience in prison, and the reason they were not meeting officially on campus: Harvard’s about-face rescinding of Manning's Visiting Fellow title last month.
Manning, a former U.S. army soldier and transgender rights activist, drew nationwide controversy after leaking several hundred thousand classified military documents. She was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2013, though then-President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in January.
The day after the Kennedy School announced Manning’s appointment, Kennedy School senior fellow and former CIA deputy director Michael J. Morell resigned and CIA Director Mike Pompeo did not show up to a speaking engagement at the IOP, both in protest of Manning's hiring. Hours later, the IOP withdrew Manning’s offer, drawing nationwide ire.
Doug Gavel, a spokesperson for Harvard Kennedy School, confirmed in an email that “the IOP was not involved” in organizing Manning's appearance at the Democracy Center.
Velona said that the change in plans made for a better, more intimate conversation last week.
"It was everything that bringing her to the IOP probably wouldn't have been,"  Velona said. “Just sitting on the floor and talking and thinking things out.”
In his letter announcing Manning’s fellowship had been rescinded, Dean of Harvard Kennedy School Doug W. Elmendorf said Manning was still invited to spend the day on campus, just not with the fellow title. The New York Times later reported that Manning declined the modified invitation.
Students who were originally excited to see Manning named a Visiting Fellow were glad to still be able to meet her. Wagner, also a member of the Trans Task Force, said the discussion “left me feeling invigorated.”
“Chelsea Manning is a personal hero of mine for the same reasons that she is an unparalleled figure in American politics," Wagner said. "No whistleblower has ever received a sentence as long and harsh as the sentence Chelsea faced, and after such harsh repression, few people would continue speaking out as boldly as Chelsea has since her release."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Between barbs at President Donald Trump and bits about his own success, Jordan Klepper, a comedian and host of Comedy Central’s "The Opposition," decried the polarization of American politics at the Institute of Politics Tuesday.
Klepper is best known for his impromptu street interviews with Trump rally attendees on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah; on his new show, Klepper parodies right-wing media and activists. In a forum moderated by IOP President Jesse I. Shelburne ’18 and Vice-President Sharon Yang ’18, Klepper elaborated on his thoughts on satire and the current political climate.
“For me, satire has always been the most effective form of comedy. I move by the showing and not telling, and seeing the follies of some of these machines and the way in which Donald Trump has to backtrack on everything he says in order to give it legitimacy,” Klepper said of the impact of his show. “A lot of really great satirical comedy shows are people who are earnest versions of themselves calling out the bullshit that is out there.”
Although Klepper acknowledges the impact that his show has on various audiences, he maintains that his show's primary intention is still comedy. He said "The Opposition" is neither meant to be an activist platform nor a reliable source of news.
“We don’t see ourselves as an activist show,” he said.  “We also don’t see ourselves as something you should use as information. If this show inspires you to feel something, to be more curious, great. Then look at other things as well as more resources. Go read beyond what our show brings you.”
Klepper also said that American politics have become too polarized, losing substance and legitimacy for many voters.
“This election was digested in such a way that it felt more like college football more than it felt like a presidency. Politics just became a sport here,” he said. “I think a lot of people thought ‘I voted for this person; this person is my guy, and any attack on him is an attack on me.’”
“I hope we can get to a place where things become less and less polarized,” he concluded on the issue. “It’s been a really frustrating few months as far as all of that goes, but everything right now is becoming a wedge issue where you can’t help but take a side.”
Roy S. Liu, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who attended the event, said it is important for students to hear from both serious and non-serious political voices.
“It’s really important to not just get serious political commentators, but also people...that make light of the political situation, because humor is one of the best ways to make light of a damp situation,” he said.
Lisa M. Merrick, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, also gave positive reviews. “I think he brought a really interesting perspective to all the extreme information being put out there right now. I’m really looking forward to see his show," she said.
Klepper’s show, The Opposition, airs every weeknight on Comedy Central.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the renovation of Winthrop House and the addition of a brand-new campus grille, three other River House grilles are feeling the heat as they compete for undergraduates’ taste buds and BoardPlus.
Managers of Dunster, Eliot, and Quincy Grilles all voiced different perspectives on whether the opening of Winthrop Grille will take a bite out of their business. But they all agree on one thing: that their own grille will triumph in a time of competition.
“We're confused why you would want to write about any grille but The Dunster Grille,” co-managers Timothy H. Shea ’18 and Emelia R. Vigil ’18 wrote in an email.
Others, meanwhile, say they question if four grilles will over-saturate the already bloated River grille market.
“Eliot’s next to Kirkland, and Dunster’s next to Mather, which is next to Adams, and we’re kind of in the middle of everyone, so everyone already has a grille near them,” said Theo C. Lebryk ’19, an inactive Crimson editor who co-manages Winthrop Grille. “Profitability is going to be difficult.”
House grilles often function as late-night eateries and gathering spaces for undergraduates, and students can use BoardPlus, the $65 per semester they receive as part of their meal plans, to buy greasy grub long after dining halls and restaurants have closed for the night.
Each grille is free to design its own menu, a reason why Lebryk says he’s confident that Winthrop Grille will come out on top. He says he’s looking forward to marketing a unique menu with a “make-your-own-adventure type deal.”
“We’re going to serve bubble tea, churros, pizza, dumplings, as well as staples that other grilles have,” Lebryk said. “If you want to add Nutella, peanut butter, and Oreos to your milkshake, go ahead. If you wanna add Nutella to your grilled cheese, possibly also go ahead.”
This strategy contrasts with the other River House grilles’ menus, which vary slightly in price and offerings but all center on french fries, mozzarella sticks, and milkshakes.
Representatives from the other grilles, however, are sure that they can hold their own against anything that Winthrop has to offer. For Dunster and Eliot grilles, the spaces also serve to facilitate social gathering.
“Out of all the student grilles on campus, I think [Eliot’s] has the best social space attached to the facility,” said Jack C. Heavey ’18, who manages Eliot Grille.
But for Quincy Grille co-manager Walter F. Hill ’19, the Grille’s central and easy-to-find location makes it uniquely popular.
“There are lots of Houses in the River area where Quincy is the nearest grille,” he said. “We have a very prime location in the river, so historically we’ve had the most foot traffic and the largest customer base.”
Still, employees and customers of the older House Grilles acknowledge the challenges Winthrop Grille’s brand-new facilities may bring to their business.
“Considering that we are the oldest grille, and our infrastructure isn’t as advanced and modern as Winthrop, it does pose some challenges,” said Quincy Grille co-manager Denise J. Kwong ’19..
Despite the challenges of new competition, grille employees said they were glad to see Winthrop Grille up and running.
“There's enough Board Plus to go around, and I’m personally excited to see what they do with their space,” said Heavey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighteen days after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, the Cambridge Police Department held a drive for relief supplies to send to Cambridge’s four Puerto Rican "sister cities."
Last Monday, the Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a resolution that named Coamo, Orocovis, Salinas, and Jayuya as Cambridge’s sister cities. The drive encouraged citizens to donate non-perishable items and critical recovery supplies, such as batteries, first aid and medical supplies, and personal care products.
According to Jeremy Warnick, director of Communications and Media Relations of the Cambridge Police Department, there are over a dozen officers in the department that were either born in or have family in Puerto Rico. Warnick said the hurricane had a deep impact on these officers, who were all subsequently involved in planning and volunteering at the drive. According to CPD, the drive “absolutely exceeded our expectations.”
“We were really overwhelmed with support,” Warnick said. “Even though the drive was officially from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., we had people showing up at eight in the morning, and even the day before, to drop off preliminary supplies.”
Warnick said the relief supplies from the drive filled up over four regular U-Haul trucks. Though this was a one-day event, Warnick said that department is considering sending officers of the Cambridge Police Department to the sister cities in Puerto Rico to help aid recovery efforts. The donated supplies are expected to arrive in Puerto Rico within the next few weeks.
Norman R. Storer ’19, Vice President of the Puerto Rican Students Organization at Harvard, said in an interview that he had not previously heard of this drive.
“As of yet, we haven’t collaborated with the City of Cambridge,” Storer said. “But that’s something that we will definitely look into since they’ve been so active, it would be a good operation.”
Storer said that though most of the Puerto Rican students at Harvard are from the metropolitan areas of Puerto Rico, Cambridge’s choice of its sister cities helps areas that otherwise may be overlooked.
“I think it’s important that Cambridge chose those cities because those are cities that are either [in] more rural areas, and they don’t necessarily have all the resources that metropolitan areas do, and it’s very important that they get attention through measures like these,” Storer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Department of Justice’s response to a Freedom of Information Act request all but confirms an active investigation into alleged discrimination in Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies.
American Oversight, a nonprofit organization formed to fight “unethical conduct throughout [President Donald Trump's] administration,” filed the FOIA request with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law—another nonprofit—on Aug. 30. In the request, they asked for documents relating to any investigation by the DOJ or Department of Education into admissions policies or criteria at Harvard and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
In a letter of response, DOJ official Nelson D. Hermilla wrote that no such documents exist regarding UNC, but did not deny the existence of Harvard-related documents, writing instead that the requested records are protected from release as they pertain to an ongoing investigation.
Hermilla's response suggests that the DOJ is moving forward with its plans—confirmed by a department spokesperson in August—to investigate allegations that the Harvard admissions department discriminates against Asian American applicants. An internal DOJ document sought to recruit lawyers in the Civil Rights Division to look into schools that could be discriminating against white applicants, though the spokesperson later said the inquiry would be narrowly targeted towards Harvard.
BuzzFeed News reported last week that American Oversight had obtained further confirmation from the DOJ that there is an ongoing investigation into Harvard’s admissions policies.
“This initiative reflects a major policy shift, with signs of inappropriate partisan political meddling,” American Oversight Executive Director Austin R. Evers and Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law President Kristen Clarke wrote in their FOIA request.
The DOJ investigation echoes the accusations leveled against both UNC and Harvard by anti-affirmative action group Project on Fair Representation. The lawsuit against Harvard, filed in 2014, charges that the College's admissions department employs illegal racial quotas in evaluating applicants.
Several legal experts have suggested that the DOJ could end up joining the lawsuit against Harvard, choosing to a file “statement of interest” in the case, submit an amicus brief, or file to “intervene”—request to join the suit on behalf of either the plaintiff or defendant.
The Harvard lawsuit is currently in late stages of its discovery phase. Expert discovery and depositions are scheduled to complete on May 1, 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two top Harvard administrators said the decision to deny Michelle Jones admission to Harvard’s graduate History program was not unusual, reiterating a previous defense of the decision from the interim dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The Marshall Project's story on Michelle Jones—a promising Ph.D. candidate who served over 20 years in prison—reported that administrators rejected Jones’s application even after several professors recommended her for admission, leading to widespread backlash against the University.
At the October Faculty meeting earlier this month, interim Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench said Jones’ denial was nothing “unusual.” In interviews, both Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and Social Sciences Dean Claudine Gay also said administrative input and disagreement with professors during the Ph.D. admissions process is not uncommon.
“It’s not unusual—well, it doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s not like it never happens,” Smith said.
“I think there are people who don’t necessarily understand how admissions work,” Gay said. “As Dean Dench was explaining, there are structural aspects that can account for misperception.”
Gay and Smith both said that they are not directly involved in Ph.D. admissions within GSAS.
“Just because admissions in the College and the graduate school both report to me doesn’t mean I have any influence on who gets admitted,” Smith said.
It is the University’s administrative policy not to discuss individual applicants like Jones. Gay said she doesn’t believe the Ph.D. admissions process would be possible “in the absence of confidentiality.”
Several Faculty members spoke at length about Jones’s application in the initial article in the Marshall Project, which Smith said they are welcome to do as individuals.
“What individual faculty do and what we do as an institution in the administration really do are two separate things,” he said. “Faculty can choose to speak about whatever they want. I hope they choose to respect the confidentiality of individuals.”
Smith added that the Marshall Project “says they’re just an independent media organization, but that’s not what it looks like to me.”
“There was an advocacy group on the other side that wants us to talk about this issue,” Smith said.
In an op-ed published in The Crimson last month, Bill Keller, the editor-in-chief of the Marshall Project, responded to similar claims that the publication was an “advocacy group”.
“Finally, for the record, the Marshall Project is a news organization that reports on the criminal justice system,” Keller wrote. “We are ‘an advocacy group’ only in the sense that we advocate honest, independent, fact-based, and fair journalism.”
In response to the Marshall Project’s article, over 150 professors signed a petition which demanded, among other things, that the University include criminal history in its non-discrimination policy. Smith declined to take a stance on whether the University should make that move.
At last week’s Faculty meeting, Anthropology Professor Rowan K. Flad  said that many people suspect that the University's decision not to admit Jones was based on a fear of bad optics.
In response to a question about University administrators taking optics into account, Smith replied:
“Can I be glib for a second? If we did, we did a poor job of it. So no, not at all. Just look at what happened.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Simon Enstrom did not give Harvard men’s soccer a fighting chance Tuesday afternoon at Jordan Field.
The Swede netted a hat trick to lead rival Boston College (4-8-0, 0-5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) to a 3-1 victory over Harvard (2-7-2, 1-1-0 Ivy League) and snap his team’s own four-game losing streak in a mid-week reprieve from conference play.
From the start, the Eagles dominated the point of attack. The junior forward recorded his first tally in the 17th minute, tapping in a front post cross, before the Crimson could even record a shot.
Harvard showed glimpses of form throughout the first half, but failed to sustain any pressure and stem the tide of Boston College’s pressure. The first 45 minutes saw both teams record the same number of shots, but BC controlled the majority of possession and put five shots on goal.
The Crimson looked to level the scoreboard in the 34th minute from the head of freshman midfielder/forward Paolo Belloni-Urso, but the rest of his body was offsides to negate the equalizer. This chance was emblematic of the entire game—Harvard’s play was fleeting, left in the missed chances and not in the results.
“It’s easy to look at the score line and get down, but I actually thought that was the best game that we have played,” senior midfielder Christian Sady said. “We kept really good possession and we fought through.”
Just as Harvard was continuing its offensive zone pressure, a perfect clearance from sophomore forward Adam French propelled the Eagles’ counter attack. Taking the ball in stride, Enstrom nodded the ball between the legs of senior goalkeeper Kyle Parks for the game’s deciding goal.
The counters by Boston College were effective throughout the match, especially in killing off any of the momentum that the Crimson sought to gain. But bad touches in the midfield and mishit shots also sent the team into the second half with little to show.
After halftime, Harvard looked to step up the offensive pressure, pushing sophomore defender/midfielder Joel Serugo and co-captain Justin Cricklow further up the field.
But Boston College kept up the attack with seven straight shots to begin the second half, culminating in a header from Enstrom to complete the hat trick. The team’s leading goal-scorer (eight) and points leader (18) made sure his team returned to Chestnut Hill with a victory, its first in its last five tries.
“His strong suit is using his body and wrapping you up,” co-captain Eric Gylling said. “The tactic is either to step in front and win the ball before it gets to him or win it off his second touch. Overall, I thought we did a pretty good job of dealing with him. Obviously, we missed him a couple of times and those were the times that they scored.”
Whether by design or desperation, Harvard started to right the ship after BC’s third goal by pushing up the field. Sophomore midfielder/forward Asa Silverman came in as a substitute and spread the field with his wing play, missing a quality chance less than a minute after stepping on the pitch.
But the Crimson leaned on its trusty veteran in Sady to finally get on the scoreboard. A centering pass put the ball at the top of the 18-yard box at the foot of Sady, whose shot was handballed by a Boston College player. He converted his own drawn penalty to pump life into the home team with less than 15 minutes remaining.
Sady’s conversion was really the product of his larger full-game effort in which he played quarterback and set up Harvard’s speckling of changes. But his goal did do well to energize the rest of the team.
Silverman put two dangerous crosses into the box, but the Crimson was unable to capitalize. Another centering pass with less than three minutes remaining led to a shot from point-blank range from Belloni-Urso, but his own teammate accidentally blocked his shot away from the touchline.
Harvard could not muster late-game heroics akin to its 2-1 earlier win at Yale, but this non-conference game means little in terms of the team’s postseason hopes, as it has split the only two Ivy League that it has played so far.
“I have every bit of belief that we are going to come out on top,” said Sady. “We’re going to keep competing and we have everything to play for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a strong performance against Penn last weekend, the No. 13 Harvard women’s field hockey team split its weekend slate, first shutting out Brown 7-0 on Friday before falling 2-1 in a shootout against No. 8 Boston College two days later.
No. 8 BOSTON COLLEGE, 2, No. 13 HARVARD, 1
Harvard’s seven game win streak came to an end in its second game of the weekend against Boston College. The offense felt the loss of junior forward Kathleen Young, who tore her ACL in the previous game against Brown. Although the Crimson maintained a possession advantage against the Eagles, outshooting Boston College, 19-14, including 9-6 in shots on goal, Eagles sophomore goalie Sarah Dwyer was strong in net, making eight saves.
For the Crimson, junior goalie Libby Manela led a powerful Harvard defense in net, recording five saves of her own and breaking up pivotal chances by the Eagles throughout the game.
During regulation, both goals were scored in the first half. For Boston College, junior midfielder Carly Kauffman snuck a shot past Manela in the 17th minute. Freshman back Hannah Pearce quickly answered for the Crimson, rifling in a shot of her own off a penalty corner in the 21st minute. On the play, senior midfielder Ellie Cookson and sophomore midfielder Casey Allen both recorded assists. Cookson now has 32 assists for her career, which further distances her from the previous school record of 26.
Following overtime, the game went into a shootout. In a close contest, Harvard eventually dropped the shootout, 2-1.
Despite the loss, the defense has been almost impenetrable, only giving up six goals in the last eight games.
“Our defense has been so strong, and we have an incredible defensive line,” said sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen. “I think our two center backs have very good dynamics, and whenever there’s something not right on the field, they are there to fix the problem for the team. Having that strength in our back is so important, and when that is all set and our defense is all in good structure, we can build off that and start scoring goals.”
After a one-sided 5-1 loss to the Eagles last season, Harvard came out on Sunday looking for a better showing and it showed
“This game showed the steps we’ve taken. We made so much progress compared to last year,” van Vlijmen said, “and the fact that we made these steps shows that we’re going to do so well, hopefully at the Ivies and the NCAA’s, if we continue to make them.”
No. 13 HARVARD, 7, BROWN, 0
In the first game of the weekend, the Crimson outshot the Bears, 30-2, including 23 shots on net. Young began the torrential scoring for Harvard, notching two goals in the first 15 minutes of play. These goals gave Young 23 points on the season, a new career high. However, the win was clouded over by a knee injury to the junior, something that will kept the team’s top point scorer out for the remainder of the weekend.
“I think it’s been an emotional weekend but it’s inspiring for the rest of season to keep pushing,” senior goalie Olivia Startup said.
Highlighted by junior back Olivia Allin ripping a shot off a penalty as time expired, the Crimson went into the half leading 4-0. The team scored another three in the second frame to put the game out of the Bears’ reach. The offense was facilitated by effective passing. Sophomore forward Maddie Earle and midfielder Casey Allen, along with Cookson, all accumulated two assists on the day.
“After a huge game like Penn, we didn’t want to get ahead of ourselves and we did a really good job of taking it game-to-game,” van Vlijmen said. “We did such a good job of being efficient. We had a lot shots on goal, of which we scored a lot."
The margin of victory was the largest for Harvard against Brown since the rivalry began in 1974. The result extended team’s winning streak to seven games. However, during the game, Young tore her ACL, leaving the Crimson without a key piece of its offense going forward.
“I think this is the best we’ve played as a unit my entire four years at Harvard,” Startup said. “Everyone is one the same page; we’re working as a unit. Every lineup is strong, so we’re really happy with how we’re flowing as a team.”
