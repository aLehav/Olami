After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. News & World Report said Monday it will include Harvard and other top law schools in their 2023-2024 rankings using a revamped methodology, even though the schools stopped cooperating with the magazine last fall.
Harvard Law School made the historic decision to withdraw from the rankings in November, just hours after Yale Law School first announced it would stop participating. At least 16 of the country’s top law schools are staging a boycott of the U.S. News rankings, citing concerns around student debt metrics, need-based aid, and diversity.
When producing its upcoming rankings of top law schools, U.S. News will now rely on publicly available data that the American Bar Association requires schools to disclose, one of several changes to the rankings the magazine announced in a Monday letter to law school deans.
Robert Morse, chief data strategist at U.S. News, wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson on Wednesday that all law schools accredited with the American Bar Association will be ranked using the public data, “regardless of whether they submit the survey to U.S. News.”
“So yes, schools such as Harvard Law and Yale Law will appear in the upcoming rankings,” Morse wrote.
HLS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment when asked if the school intends to reconsider its participation with the U.S. News rankings.
Yale Law School Dean Heather K. Gerken said in a statement Monday that the school will not reconsider its decision to stop cooperating with the U.S. News rankings following the changes announced by the magazine.
“Having a window into the operations and decision-making process at U.S. News in recent weeks has only cemented our decision to stop participating in the rankings,” Gerken wrote.
U.S. News also announced Monday it will place more weight on school-funded fellowships and the number of graduates who go on to pursue advanced degrees in the upcoming rankings.
“Indebtedness will not be used in the upcoming ranking as it is not a publicly available figure,” Morse wrote. “However, it may be displayed on the school profile or in a tool, as we believe this is useful student information.”
In a November email to HLS affiliates announcing the school’s decision to withdraw from the rankings, HLS Dean John F. Manning ’82 criticized the magazine’s consideration of student debt at graduation and added that its methodology creates perverse incentives for law schools to favor academic credentials without considering financial need when calculating financial aid.
“For these and other reasons, we will no longer participate in the U.S. News process,” Manning wrote in the email. “It does not advance the best ideals of legal education or the profession we serve, and it contradicts the deeply held commitments of Harvard Law School.”
Harvard ranked fourth in the 2022-2023 U.S. News rankings, behind Yale, Stanford, and the University of Chicago.
While no law schools have publicly reversed their decision to stop cooperating with the rankings, Kate O’Donnell, vice president of communications at U.S. News wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that changes to the methodology were well received by schools.
“Our data journalists are currently at the Association of American Law Schools annual conference and are meeting with deans to answer questions on the announced changes,” O’Donnell wrote.
“I can’t comment at this time if they’ve heard from HLS specifically, but know they have received a great deal of positive feedback from institutions as to the changes that were announced,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Chief Technology Officer Jason Snyder will lead the Massachusetts Executive Office of Technology Services and Security, Governor Maura T. Healey ’92 announced Wednesday.
“Secretary Snyder has decades of experience building strong teams and implementing best technology practices in government, in higher education and in the private sector,” Healey said in a statement. “We’re confident that he will make sure our digital information is high quality and secure, and that the people of Massachusetts have access to the services they need.”
Snyder, who was sworn in Friday morning, succeeds Curtis M. Wood, who also served as the commonwealth’s Chief Information Officer and announced his retirement in December.
“The Commonwealth of Massachusetts does incredible work day in and day out to deliver critical services to residents, but we need to make sure that everyone is able to access those services,” Snyder said in a statement. “I’m honored to have the opportunity to serve in the Healey-Driscoll Administration and look forward to the work ahead to make sure that our technology is resilient, secure and accessible to all.”
Snyder, who previously served as Massachusetts’ chief technology officer under former Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, is one of two Harvard affiliates to join Healey’s burgeoning cabinet. He joins incoming Secretary of the Executive Office of Education Patrick A. Tutwiler, who received a master’s degree from Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Harvard University Information Technology Vice President and Chief Information Officer Klara Jelinkova thanked Snyder for his work at Harvard in a Wednesday message to the department.
“While I will miss Jason’s leadership and expertise—and, most of all, his collegial and collaborative approach—I am excited that he will have the opportunity to serve the Commonwealth in such a critical and meaningful role,” she wrote.
She credited Snyder with introducing the security features HarvardKey and Duo, improving Harvard’s WiFi service, and bolstering the school’s technological resiliency.
Jelinkova also announced that Erica Bradshaw, currently HUIT’s managing director for strategic transformation and associate chief technology officer, will serve as the school’s interim CTO.
Jelinkova did not comment on when a permanent replacement for Snyder would be found.
Healey, herself a Harvard alum, had previously chosen several Harvard affiliates to serve on her gubernatorial transition team, including Kennedy School lecturer Thomas P. Glynn III, Medical School professor Lisa I. Iezzoni, and University professor Danielle S. Allen — Healey’s former opponent in the Democratic primary for governor.
Snyder’s departure continues a massive turnover in top posts across the University. In the coming months, Harvard will see a new President, four new academic deans, and a host of other changes in executive positions across the University’s administration.
Correction: January 6, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly described Erica Bradshaw as Harvard’s managing director for strategic transformation. In fact, Bradshaw is HUIT's managing director for strategic transformation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maura T. Healey ’92 was sworn in as Massachusetts’ 73rd governor on Thursday, becoming the first woman elected governor to take office in the state’s history.
Healey, who was elected as attorney general in 2014, won the governorship handily in November against Geoffrey G. Diehl, a former state representative endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump. She succeeds Charlie D. Baker ’79, who will be starting as the next president of the NCAA in March.
In addition to being the state’s first female elected governor, Healey is the third consecutive Harvard College graduate in the post — the 26th in the commonwealth’s history. She will also be one of the first two openly lesbian governors in American history, along with Governor-elect Tina Kotek of Oregon.
“I assume this office with humility, mindful of the weight of history, enlightened by the gift of gratitude,” Healey said in her inauguration speech in the Massachusetts State House chamber. “It is the honor of my life to lead this state.”
The audience included many current and former Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA), former Democratic presidential nominees Michael S. Dukakis and John F. Kerry, and former governors William F. Weld ’66 and Deval S. Patrick ’78.
In her speech, Healey pledged to make strides on a range of issues, including housing, child care, education, infrastructure, and climate change.
Citing Massachusetts’ higher-than-average rents, Healey said she planned to create the position of secretary of housing to coordinate housing and affordability goals across the state and “end the nightmare of high costs.”
“If we want Massachusetts to be a home for all, we need to build more places to live, and we need to make sure those homes are within reach,” Healey said to sustained applause.
Healey also promised to implement a child tax credit for Massachusetts families, calling attention to the state’s high child care costs.
“The strength of Massachusetts is its families,” Healey said. “So today, let us pledge to be the first state to solve the child care crisis.”
In addition, Healey pledged to create a new program she dubbed “MassReconnect,” which she said would offer a free community college education to people over the age of 25 who don’t already have a degree and provide greater funding for state universities.
“The first free school was established in our state almost 400 years ago,” Healey said. “We will continue to offer not just an education but the best education.”
Lieutenant Governor Kimberley L. Driscoll was also inaugurated alongside Healey.
Driscoll, who succeeded outgoing Lieutenant Governor Karyn E. Polito, thanked her predecessor and Baker for working across the aisle in their roles.
“They chose a bipartisan, people-centered approach and governed with a wide lens, a big heart, and an open mind,” Driscoll said in her inaugural address.
Healey has been building her cabinet for days now, selecting top officials to lead the state’s executive departments. On Wednesday, the day prior to her inauguration, she appointed two more officials, including Harvard University Chief Technology Officer Jason Snyder as the secretary of the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security.

A Cambridge Police officer shot and killed an allegedly armed man Wednesday, prompting dozens to protest police brutality and call for transparency at Cambridge City Hall Thursday.
The man was identified Wednesday evening by Cambridge Police Department as 20-year-old Sayed Faisal, a Cambridge resident and University of Massachusetts Boston student. Faisal’s death is currently under investigation by the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office. After seven years with the CPD, the officer who shot Faisal was placed on administrative leave.
At 1:15 p.m. Wednesday, a 911 caller reported that Faisal had jumped out of a window and appeared to be harming himself, according to a CPD press release. After a chase through several blocks in Cambridgeport, Faisal allegedly moved toward officers while wielding a kukri knife. A CPD officer shot Faisal with a non-lethal sponge round, the release said, and when this did not stop Faisal, an officer fatally shot him.
Faisal later died from his injuries after being transported to Massachusetts General Hospital.
The last fatal officer-involved shooting involving the Cambridge Police occurred more than 20 years ago in 2002, CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an email Friday.
In a joint statement Wednesday, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 said they were “deeply saddened” by the shooting, adding that the city would hold a community meeting at an unspecified date to process Faisal’s death.
“Our thoughts and condolences go out to the family and loved ones of the deceased,” Siddiqui and Huang wrote. “We are committed to learning from this case to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone in our community.”
The Bangladesh Association of New England, a cultural nonprofit for Bangladeshi Americans, condemned the killing of Faisal, which they called an act of police brutality in a Wednesday Facebook post.
“He was the only child of his family. This is not acceptable,” the group wrote. “We need to bring justice for this young brother.”
The organization has raised around $12,000 to cover costs for Faisal’s funeral and support his family, as of Friday afternoon. The group also held a rally Thursday afternoon at Cambridge City Hall to protest the killing of Faisal, calling for complete transparency from the department.
The protest was attended by more than 50 people, including friends and family members. Some held handwritten signs reading “CPD IS NO EXCEPTION,” “Justice for Sayed Faisal,” and “We Don’t Trust Your BS Investigation.” Sayed Mujibullah, Faisal’s father, stood among the demonstrators with tears in his eyes.
Mujibullah said through a translator that Faisal “was a very meritorious student” in an interview with WCVB.
“He was going to the University of Massachusetts,” Mujibullah said, adding that he had hoped his son would become a doctor or engineer.
“Now, all hope is gone,” he added.
Some protestors charged that Faisal’s killing was racially motivated, and others questioned the need for police in Cambridge to wield lethal weapons at all, citing the city’s low crime rate compared to other cities.
Warnick wrote in an email that “it would not be appropriate” to comment on individual allegations while the shooting is under active investigation, adding that the officer who shot Faisal had no complaints filed against him in his career.
“The District Attorney’s office will be conducting a complete and transparent investigation,” Cambridge Police Commissioner Christine A. Elow said at a Wednesday briefing after the shooting. “The Cambridge Police Department will be cooperating 100 percent with that investigation.”
“Any time a life is lost in our community, it is tragic, so we are all mourning,” she said.
At the rally, Bangladesh Association of New England President Pervin A. Chowdhury called for more accountability.
“He’s a baby – you can’t just shoot,” Chowdhury said. “This police need to be trained.”
Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan offered his condolences to Faisal’s family in an emailed statement to The Crimson and called for Cambridge to look into alternatives to policing for public safety.
“We must reject the racist system of policing that is failing our young people, failing our minority communities, and failing those experiencing a personal crisis,” he wrote.
“If we don’t drastically change our approach to public safety, it is only a matter of time before this happens again,” Zondervan added.

A Middlesex County Superior Court judge last month dismissed claims against Harvard and two residential deans in a wrongful death lawsuit which alleges the defendants were negligent in the care of Luke Z. Tang ’18, an undergraduate who died by suicide in 2015.
The dismissal follows a November hearing where attorneys for Harvard argued for a ruling to dismiss without trial, claiming the defendants upheld their duty of care to Tang. David W. Heinlein, the attorney representing Tang’s family, said he plans to appeal the decision, which came on Dec. 20.
Filed in 2018 by Tang’s father, the complaint accuses the defendants — Harvard, Senior Resident Dean Catherine R. Shapiro, former Lowell House Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03, and Counseling and Mental Health Service employee Melanie G. Northrop — of “negligence and carelessness” resulting in Tang’s death.
In a 22-page document, Superior Court Judge Brent A. Tingle outlined his decision to dismiss the suit against Harvard, Shapiro, and Casey, writing that the parties did satisfy their duty of care to Tang following an initial suicide attempt in spring 2015.
“This limited duty is based on the Court’s recognition that non-clinicians such as Shapiro and Casey are poorly situated to probe or discern suicidal intentions that are not expressly evident,” Tingle wrote. “The position advanced by Dr. Tang would essentially require non-clinicians like Shapiro and Casey to identify acute suicidal intentions even where the student expressly denies being suicidal.”
Tingle added that the Tang family’s legal argument would require universities to continually monitor students and their risk for suicide.
“This is directly contrary to the Court’s stated goal of respecting the privacy, autonomy, and desire of an adult student to seek help for mental health issues,” Tingle wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the dismissal.
In a November decision, Tingle allowed claims against Northrop, who served as Tang’s case manager, to proceed. If not settled out of court, her case will go to a jury trial.
Much of the case against Harvard and its employees centers around precedent established in Nguyen v. MIT — a 2018 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling concerning a graduate student who died by suicide on MIT’s campus in 2009.
In that decision, a judge found MIT was not liable for the death of the student and outlined specific circumstances that must exist for a university to be held legally responsible. Those circumstances include a student informing university officials of suicidal ideation or a recent suicide attempt.
The suit also argued that the College and Shapiro, specifically, assumed an additional, voluntary duty of care to Tang when they required him to remain in outpatient therapy following his suicide attempt.
In his decision, Tingle rejected the plaintiff’s line of reasoning.
“A voluntary duty of the type Dr. Tang advocates for in this case is not grounded in the typical expectations of a college or university to its students,” he wrote.
Heinlein said he was “extremely disappointed” by the decision to dismiss in a Thursday interview.
“I don’t believe that the trial judge applied the correct standard in reaching his decision,” Heinlein said.
Heinlein added that he would ask the Middlesex Superior Court to enter a final judgment against Harvard, Casey, and Shapiro before beginning the appeal process.
In his decision, Tingle also described what he called “serious policy implications” of the suit’s legal position. He wrote that if universities took on an additional duty after requiring a student to get therapy after a suicide attempt, the institutions may instead opt to dismiss the student or make no effort to require treatment for fear of future liability.
Heinlein said he was “perfectly fine” with schools dismissing students after suicide attempts, but disagreed with Tingle’s evaluation of the case’s potential implications.
“I do not believe that anybody anywhere, particularly people that are working at CAMHS or in health services, are going to say, ‘We’re not going to help one of our students, because if he commits suicide in the future, we might get sued,’” Heinlein said. “I just find that to be offensive.”
The timeline for an appeal is uncertain, Heinlein added.
