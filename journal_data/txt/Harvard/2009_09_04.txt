After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard kids have sex. Sometimes they do drugs. But it’s not often that they rock ‘n’ roll. Last Wednesday at Harvard Rocks NYC, five bands featuring Harvard alumni took to the stage in the first off-campus music festival to bring Crimson rockers together. Ashley V. Furst ’03, the lead singer of the Ashley 1st Band and creator of the event, set out to create exposure for the artists while proving that Harvard is, in fact, a rich source of rock musicians. Having been recently turned away from other music festivals, Furst hoped not only to provide a venue where Harvard musicians could be seen but also to disprove the assumption that Harvard students can’t be rock stars.“People expect us to calculate the rate at which a rock rolls—not give them straight-up rock ‘n’ roll,” Furst says.The path from Harvard student to rock musician is not obvious. As Socrates R. Cruz ’06 of the band Moniker said, “It’s not like there is a music business concentration.” Indeed, many of the musicians have struggled to break into a world where a Harvard diploma is more of a curiosity than anything else. Harvard Rocks NYC offered these aspiring artists, who have mostly found themselves making it alone in the New York music scene, a chance to find support in each other’s experiences, network, and show the audience that Harvard truly rocks.CREATING THE FIRST CRIMSON ROCK EVENTHarvard Rocks NYC was produced in collaboration with Harvardwood, a non-profit organization for Harvard students, alumni, and staff interested in the arts, media, and entertainment. The festival was born during a panel on music and the economy held by the New York branch of Harvardwood last spring. Jared L. Hoffman ’84, president and CEO of Knitting Factory Entertainment, parent company of the legendary New York club of the same name was among the participants.Furst—who was one of the panelists—saw an opportunity to use Harvard’s biggest resource—its people—to help promote and showcase unsigned bands like her own. Harvardwood, looking to expand its reach beyond Hollywood and film, was only too willing to help.For the next six months, Furst worked tirelessly to pull the music festival together. Looking specifically to create an event that would attract a wide range of young alums not necessarily involved in the music scene, it was important that Furst pick the right venue. Tenjune, a pricey nightspot in the meatpacking district, was just the kind of club she was looking for. Known not as a venue for live shows but as the place where Kanye West and Britney Spears had their birthdays, Tenjune attracted the kind of audience that would come first for the atmosphere and then for the music.“Before, we’d bring people to the music—a place known for the music,” Furst says. This time however, the goal was to “bring the music to the people.”First up were two singer-songwriter acts—the poppy band of Alison R. Wood ’01, and Jeremy J. Parise ’96—who played to an audience clustered in pairs on the requisite low leather couches. At this point, the oval-shaped room, covered with overlapping wooden panels, felt like the belly of a very fashionable beast. But as louder acts followed—with the youthful Moniker rocking out on their four guitars and asking the crowd to get up—Tenjune started to feel like a real rock venue. The seasoned band The States, fronted by guitarist-songwriter Christopher W. Snyder ’04 and the Ashley 1st Band headlined the night with good, clean rock.Though much emphasis was placed on the event’s packaging, in the end, it was all about the music. Frustrated by the seemingly random choice of acts at many of the venues she had played, Furst tried to build a cohesive lineup of artists who had seen some sort of success. “Each band was handpicked to represent the next generation of hits of rock and roll,” she says. FROM HARVARD TO RAMENNew York is famous for its struggling musicians, and those with Harvard diplomas are no exception. For Snyder, this meant the need to “subsist on pb&j for months at a time.”Life as a starving artist came as a shock to many of the musicians after the support they claimed to have received as undergraduates—from a new recording studio at Hilles to performance venues where some of the bands first got their start. Snyder created The States in the basement of Leverett F Tower his junior year. Cruz founded the band Major Major during his time at Harvard and was also the head of Mariachi Veritas.Even if they didn’t start a rock band at Harvard, most who played at Harvard Rocks NYC took advantage of Harvard’s music scene. Wood dabbled in musical theater and was a member of the a cappella group The Callbacks. Snyder, originally a violinist, played in two orchestras and a string quartet while at Harvard.Furst’s path was more unusual. Instead of pursuing music, she instead concentrated on track and field and eventually became co-captain. A sociology concentrator, Furst always intended to go to graduate school but realized by the end of college that her heart wasn’t in it. She decided to move to Manhattan and there discovered that music was her calling. “I never heard music in my head and then I moved to New York City and started hearing it one day,” Furst says.Even for those who had focused on music during college, most had other plans. Cruz had a job lined up in Latin America after college and always thought he would do something with Latin American politics. Instead, he showed up in New York with his guitar and little else planned.Though Harvard’s resources could let them make music, there was no guidance in how to turn it into a career. “Were there a lot of resources on how to do it? No,” Snyder says. “There wasn’t a career fair you could go to.” In New York, their Harvard degrees proved unhelpful and, in some cases, left them with a lot of catching up to do.In The Ashley 1st Band, Furst is the only one without a degree—a music degree that is. Receiving none of the formal training of her band mates, she relies on them to translate the songs that are in her head. “In the practice room, the Harvard diploma doesn’t tell me what key it’s in,” the singer says.A lack of professional training was just one of the challenges that the hopeful musicians faced trying to launch their music careers. “We moved to New York and got a few day jobs and thought that a few shows was all it would take,” Snyder says. Trying to make it in the music industry was much harder than these artists expected. “I was definitely not prepared coming out of Harvard for a career in music, but that was part of the thrill,” Cruz says.Nevertheless, each band has found a measure of success in the rock world; they’ve gone on tours, recorded albums, and all have plans to continue. “Momentum is building. We’re not signed but we have all the credentials,” Furst says. The musicians know that the music business is difficult, but they are all sticking to it. “I’m glad to be taking an out of left field approach to my life after Harvard,” Snyder says.And for now, even if they are unsigned, they are happy to be simply making music. “I have no aspirations to be the next Britney Spears,” Wood says. “My favorite thing is when someone hears my song and says that they like it.” A ROCK ‘N’ ROLL COMMUNITYMany expressed the wish that the rock ‘n’ roll not stop with Harvard Rocks NYC. While the event was aimed squarely at alumni, organizers do hope to bridge the gap between undergraduates and recent grads jumping into a career in the arts. After being involved in the festival, Snyder talked to Porter about creating a Harvardwood event whereby musicians could give crucial advice to students pursuing musical careers, an idea Cruz seconded.“As an artist and someone who was at Harvard at a time when the OCS wasn’t sure how to advise us, I love the fact that Harvardwood exists now,” Wood says. “There is a support structure for those who want to go into arts related careers.”  After graduating without intensive musical training, the connections Harvard invariably provides may be all aspiring musicians have, especially in an industry where success is heavily dependent on word of mouth.“We’re really excited about networking with some of the people,” Cruz says. “I’ve been a huge fan of The States since I was an undergrad and saw them perform.  They were kind of like a big influence on me, and I’m excited to see that they’re still going—doing a lot of festival circuits right now.  I’m excited to swap ideas, see what other bands are doing.”For The States, it was the prospect of new fans. “It’s the same thing we try to get out of every show.  Play for new people, make new fans,” says Cruz, who got the chance to perform in front of a crowd of 200. “I’m hoping that Harvardwood and the band can put our heads together and see if there are any events we can put together.” Although the five bands had made it on their own thus far, the chance to share war stories with each other and use their alma mater to gain increased visibility was one they greatly appreciated. It was no career fair or magic job offer, but it was a sign that Harvard really did believe that they rocked.“We’re at a point right now where a few factors have come together that make it possible, if we do everything right, to create a really vibrant arts community in New York,” Porter says. “And this would pay off for everybody in the arts at Harvard.”—Staff writer Rebecca J.

Art has a remarkable ability to beautify even the bleakest of urban and professional settings. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Holyoke Center, where a series of prints redefines the otherwise drab space occupied by the southern elevator foyer. The university has filled the alcove with an exhibition of photographs by Harvard Law School Professor emeritus Henry Steiner, on display until September 23.  While the title “From Film to Digital: Fresh Images Over Decades” may give false promise of an innovative look at the new age of digital photography, it still proves to be a thought-provoking exhibition. Seven years ago, Steiner embraced the changes in the photographic world and switched from film to digital. This transition, perhaps a significant one in light of the exhibition’s title, is nevertheless completely glossed over therein.  “From Film to Digital” features a selection of 26 of Steiner’s prints spanning four decades and six continents. But these photos are explained only by printout labels with little more information than the title of the piece and the location of the shot, leaving a void where one might expect to find some rationale for featuring these works under this heading. Sprawling landscapes and faces from across the world are hardly anything innovative in the photographic world. Instead, the depth of the exhibition comes from the implicit connection between the prints and Steiner’s professional work with human rights activism. The photographs aren’t the stock shots of the starving and desolate women and children one might expect from the founder of Harvard Law School Human Rights Program; but  instead they offer a subtler look at the beauty and diversity of the earth’s landscapes and its inhabitants. The selections in the exhibition can be divided into two general categories: landscapes and portraits. Emphasizing the designs and patterns found in nature and light, many of the landscape photographs feature stunning vistas that feel strangely geometrical given the organic nature of the subjects. At first glance, “Fields and Diagonals, Umbria, Italy” simply looks like blocks and stripes of rich vibrant colors. Only upon closer examination do the rolling fields of Italy reveal themselves. Faces from around the world punctuate the display of scenic terrains, giving the geometric landscapes a human side and situating them within a larger context. An old Cretan woman framed in her yellow doorway stands alone observing a campaign speech. Young boys solemnly look at the camera while apprenticing at a monastery in central Bhutan. In the village of west Hanoi children poke fun at the camera, while somewhere in the outskirts of Kamapala, Uganda, a mysterious woman stares intensely at its lens. The colorful aerial shot of nearly nude tanners on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro juxtaposed with the sea of headscarves on young Muslim school girls in Cairo, Egypt drives home the incredible diversity of beauty found across the continents. While the exhibition might be poorly named, it still has much to offer. Rather than becoming an argument over photographic methods, “From Film to Digital”  examines a deeper topic and gives dignity to people that are often forgotten or objectified. The prints might not be the most novel, but they are certainly well captured and visually appealing. Positioned in an easily accessible space that many pass daily, the prints are worth a small detour, if only to provide a moment of reflection on the diversity of the world at large.                                                                                        —Staff writer Erika P. Pierson can be reached at epierson@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There were new permissions in the air, and old hierarchies had softened, had become ripe for toppling,” wrote Susan Sontag in her 1996 piece “Thirty Years Later,” looking back on the cultural landscape mapped out in her first essay collection. It was, she concluded, a “mythical era.”
The elegiac tone of Sontag’s retrospective is characteristic of most modern reflections on the 60s. By now, the decade has become the locus of an intense cultural nostalgia, a yearning to recapture the youthful enthusiasm that inspired such diverse movements as Beat and Psychedelic “Happenings,” New Wave cinema, and the political dissidence that exploded in May 1968. Part of this longing has to do with the sense of a missed moment: failing to generate a coherent intellectual program, the spontaneous activism of the American Left eventually dissolved into stagflation and Vietnam. In Latin America, a similar trajectory was under way, as the 70s transformed student-movements’ revolutionary energies into Pinochet’s military rule and Castro’s communism. The question for many artists at the time thus became how to probe the breach between the rich creative promise of the period and what it had actually become.
This unspoken tension lies at the heart of Argentinean author Julio Cortázar’s novel “Hopscotch,” one of the most beautiful, complex portraits we have of the idealism and subsequent disillusionment of that decade. Cortázar—a literary heavyweight in Latin America, associated with the prolific Boom period of the 60s and 70s—wrote “Hopscotch” in 1963, after his move to France to escape dictator Juan Domingo Perón, and its Left Bank influences are clear. In stunningly tactile prose, the novel follows pseudo-autobiographical protagonist Horacio Oliveira, also an Argentinean expatriate, through his nights of jazz, cigarette smoke, and intellectual conversation in Paris with a group of friends dubbed the “Serpent Club.” 
What makes “Hopscotch” worth returning to, more than anything else, is simply the language itself. The words, rich with sensuous description, overflow their narrative bounds; winding sentences, propelled by commas, curl into perfect metaphors. The reader experiences the glow of a cigarette “slowly sketching out the shapes of his insomnia,” a passing moment as “putting down an empty glass on the table,” light as a “dove in the hands of a madman.” (For the sleek rendering of Cortázar’s surrealistic, reference-laden brand of introspection, the English reader is indebted to translator Gregory Rabassa.)
It’s a curious bit of authorial self-sabotage though, for as he witnessed the paralyzing effects of theory over action, Cortázar grew deeply suspicious of such a passive appreciation of words. In one of his early short stories, a character in a detective novel murders his reader as he sits quietly in a green velvet armchair flipping the pages. In “Hopscotch,” the pleasures of a linear plot are mocked in a substantial third section subtitled “Expendable Chapters,” the literary equivalent of a DVD bonus disc. This segment features additional scenes, stream-of-consciousness monologues, an eclectic collection of quotations, a list of acknowledgements (including everyone from Jelly Roll Morton to Gilgamesh), and something called “Morelliana”—dense metaphysical excerpts from the Serpent Club’s favorite philosopher, Morelli, whose authorial pronouncements often make him a stand-in for Cortázar himself.
Cortázar’s demands on the reader’s engagement are perhaps most obvious, however, in the novel’s structure. “Hopscotch” can be read either linearly, from Chapter 1 through Chapter 155, or it can be tackled in the order suggested by the fanciful “Table of Instructions” provided at the beginning of the book, which sends the reader “hopscotching” from one chapter to another based on the loosest of associations. Such “make your own adventure”-style plotting can come off as familiar—even gimmicky—now that the approach has been co-opted by a subset of experiment-driven postmodern writers. Yet it speaks to Cortázar’s larger ambition to introduce a little anarchy into our reverence to literary tradition and to words, “those made-up pimps.”
Happily, these narrative games don’t slide into mere linguistic exercises. The thanks for this is due largely to the playfulness of the characters, who speak in slangy “Gliglish” and meet in the self-proclaimed “cemetery of language.” Oliveira’s lover La Maga enters like a light breeze: her intuitive connections to the things around her serve as a foil for the often laughably cerebral shoptalk of the others. “She picked up a leaf from the edge of the sidewalk and spoke to it for a while, moved it along the palm of her hand, put it rightside up and upside down, stroked it, and finally she took off the leafy part and left the veins exposed, a delicate green ghost was reflected against her skin,” writes Cortázar. When La Maga disappears, a despairing Oliveira returns to Buenos Aires to track her down.
Though Cortázar’s story “The Devil’s Drool” famously inspired Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 “Blowup,” it’s another Antonioni film—“L’avventura”—that best mirrors the enigmatic circles in which Oliveira moves. In that movie, the presumable storyline of a woman going missing seems to be forgotten by everyone in the scenes that follow; similarly, La Maga’s absence doesn’t give rise to the conventional narrative arc. Oliveira half-heartedly looks for her, but his restlessness has much deeper roots. Like so much literature of the 60s, “Hopscotch” is—at its core—about a more metaphysical search. “It was about that time I realized that searching was my symbol, the emblem of those who go out at night with nothing in mind, the motives of a destroyer of compasses,” Cortázar writes.
Indeed, in Cortázar’s hands, all the possible consolations to which his characters turn—“vodka and Kantian categories,” love or political action—inevitably become only “tranquilizers against any too sharp coagulation of reality.” All individual choices are colored with the pigments of despair; all action comes to seem only a futile bulwark against ultimate insanity, or suicide, or conformity. Reading the book Cortázar’s way traps one in a final loop between two random chapters. “Sometimes I am convinced that the triangle is another name for stupidity, that eight times eight is madness or a dog,” utters one of Oliveira’s friends, regressing into nonsensical nihilism.
But there’s a reason why even the gentleman-poet Pablo Neruda was moved to remark, quite seriously, that “anyone who doesn’t read Cortázar is doomed.” Cortázar’s hope, given us via Morelli, was to “attempt a work which may seem alien or antagonistic to the time and history surrounding it, and which nonetheless includes it, explains it, and in the last analysis orients it towards a transcendence within whose limits man is waiting.” No light task. The ultimate success of “Hopscotch” lies in the cock-eyed bravery of its attempt.

It is impossible to read “North of South,” Shiva Naipaul’s cynical yet deeply moving account of a late 1970s journey through East Africa, without being reminded of the travel writings of his legendary elder brother, V.S. Naipaul. Only 40 when he died of a heart attack in 1985, the unfortunate younger Naipaul cannot escape comparisons to his sibling, older by 13 years and a  literary behemoth and Nobel Laureate often described as Britain’s greatest living writer. Shiva Naipaul’s work is more than worthy of notice on its own merits, but in so far as he has been remembered at all in recent years, it has been as V.S. Naipaul’s brother.Like the elder Naipaul, Shiva began his career writing comic novels set in their family’s native Trinidad; works such as “Fireflies” and “The Chip-Chip Gatherers” won literary prizes and critical approval, and although he would write only one more novel in his lifetime, his skill as a storyteller translated readily to a distinctive brand of non-fiction analogous to his brother’s approach as a novelist. “North of South” (whose title refers to the countries Naipaul visits being north of South Africa), his first book of non-fiction, often reads like a novel, albeit one that is as keenly concerned with history, politics, and sociology as it is with its characters. Including such an array of weighty and entangling material, however, does not overburden the book with research or theory. Rather, Naipaul’s art of character and his attention to detail only serve to enrich the work. At the outset, Naipaul sets himself to the task of investigating Africa and its politics through its people and their experiences. He laments the myopic Western focus on African politicians, not Africans themselves, “The book will arise, I hope, out of my own concerns—or, if you prefer, obsessions. What do terms like ‘liberation,’ ‘revolution,’ ‘socialism,’ actually mean to the people—i.e. the masses—who experience them.”Naipaul explores the effects of policies such as Tanzanian dictator Julius Nyerere’s “ujamaa” on the ground. He writes with pitiless, unflinching accuracy and cynicism, never failing to completely evoke the abject poverty and horrors that he witnesses. This relentless honesty earned him accusations of racism in his lifetime and has ensured that the book remains relatively obscure, its truths too uncomfortable for the self-selecting blindness of a West devoted to political correctness first and foremost. In truth, Naipaul is not a racist, nor any kind of bigot. He is certainly less sympathetic to his subjects than many other contemporary writers on Africa, but at the same time he condemns the simplicities of racial analysis and highlights the unfair plight of Indian immigrants throughout East Africa. His brother has fallen understandably under fire for ethnically and religiously insensitive remarks—in recent years, V.S. Naipaul has been overtly prejudiced in his assessment of Muslims and the Islamic World—but Shiva Naipaul, by contrast, merely shares his brother’s resonance and descriptive eye for the evocatively grotesque, notably in the instance of the diseased mendicants on the streets of Nairobi; “Most were maimed. Lepers with truncated arms and legs were a common sight; but even more numerous than the lepers were victims of severe bone malformation, the result of calcium deficiency. This affliction ravages the human frame, reducing it to tangled wreckage of atrophied limbs.”The prose is not merely precise but elegant and memorable, full of acerbic wit and unusual metaphor. The writing illuminates not only the landscape and the people in general, but also a succession of unforgettable characters that illustrate the range of issues confronting modern Africa. One essentially tragicomic figure is the Sikh whom Naipaul meets on the plane to Nairobi; on the one hand, the author is repelled by the bumbling, garrulous man, overeager to befriend a stranger who is similarly of Indian origin. Yet Naipaul writes with uncharacteristic feeling for the Sikh’s profound predicament as a British Asian going to Tanzania to try and extricate his own mother. He writes of the outright racism that the Sikh experiences at Nairobi Airport, where British Asians are denied entry into Kenya without a visa despite every other British citizen being given free entry. Similarly vivid is Naipaul’s encounter with a Kenyan shoeshine boy who displays both an entrepreneurial bent and a streetwise cunning in trying to cheat the author. The book’s political analysis is as incisive as the best political journalism, and Naipaul presents the causes of Africa’s problems with rare balance and simplicity; “At the height of the slave trade, African rulers seemed literally to have gone mad. To get hold of the guns and tobacco and brandy they craved, some chiefs betrayed and enslaved their own people. The desire to possess had spiraled out of control. Their successors behave no differently. Slavery, of course, is now illegal. But are there any moral distinctions to be drawn between a chief who, in order to satisfy his lust for brandy, sells his own people into slavery and the contemporary politician who, coveting a Mercedes-Benz, embezzles the funds of a charity set up to help orphan children?” But, as Naipaul reiterates, even the most glutinous despot is hopeless without a sympathetic, or at least ambivalent host of subjects: “Africans are content with the political kingdom.”Thirty years after it first appeared in the United States, “North of South” is as thrilling, disturbing, and relevant as ever. Read it to receive a much-needed dose of honesty in the face of the increasingly desensitized literary and political discourse on Africa.—Staff writer Keshava D. Guha kdguha@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“He lived in the Hotel Coma—named perhaps for some founder of the town, some California explorer or pioneer, or for some long-deceased Italian immigrant who founded only the hotel itself. Whoever it commemorated, the hotel was a poor monument, and Bill Tully had no intention of staying on.” It’s almost trite to start at the beginning, but it’s as good a place as any in Leonard Gardener’s debut novel, 1969’s “Fat City.” From its opening moments, “Fat City” vaults the pretense of the so-called ‘boxing novel’—then a genre unto itself and at the time one as viable as the eminently popular ‘western novel’—and leaves it far behind. In a way, these first lines do more to circumscribe the western genre than they do the boxing genre. Almost instantly, Gardener crystallizes the already-swelling malaise taking hold of the national consciousness in the decline of the 60s counterculture, mediated through the lens of its physical analogy: the American Frontier. It’s at this very moment, in 1969, when America is faced with the choice of acknowledging its limits, be they the shores of the Pacific, the streets of Chicago or the defoliated landscape of Vietnam. But Bill Tully, like so many others, is unwilling to look.Only the most gifted storyteller can say all of this without saying any of it. “Fat City” is chiefly an examination of an American society that refuses to reflect on itself. Instead, it is one obsessed with its own culture and tradition—futilely reciting its own history, vaunting the likes of pillaging explorers and toothless prospectors into high history, however much it may reel in disgust over where that history has left off. The punchdrunk men that shuffle in the streets of Stockton, CA are the orphans of generations prior, generations with some war or famine or calling to give them purpose. So they fight.The fighting never finds purpose, and the fighting never becomes a purpose in and of itself. Nor does boxing become some sort of metaphor for life or pseudo-fascist cathartic experience. Gardener’s no fool. If anything, boxing becomes a symbol for the sort of self-flagellation these men undergo in their blind need for a spiritual home. Far from heroic, or even sympathetic, Gardener renders them as drifters, dangerous pilgrims wandering in amnesiac hazes or fevered dreams: “In the midst of a phantasmagoria of worn-out, mangled faces, scarred cheeks and necks, twisted, pocked, crushed and bloated noses, missing teeth, brown snags, empty gums, stubble beards, pitcher lips, flop ears, sores, scabs, dribbled tobacco juice, stooped shoulders, split brows, weary, desperate, stupefied eyes under the lights of Center Street, Tully saw a familiar young man with a broken nose.” When Tully lies among these men in the park, the town cuts down the trees that provide their shade. Communities take only an interest in their dispersal. Their only place is in the dungeons of gymnasium locker rooms. The face Tully sees may as well be a memory of his own.Gardener baits the reader with a formula that would ordinarily indicate a redemption story: Tully, a fighter who retired when a change in luck robbed him of his wife and his will, finds his taste for the sport revived—if briefly—after sparring with recreational boxer Ernie Munger, only a teenager when Tully encourages him to turn pro. The classic boxing arc would pit these two against one another in the final act—vitality supplanting experience, in expectedly American fashion—but as Munger emerges as the novel’s other main protagonist, the two barely meet one another again.What at first appears to be an unresolved narrative gives way to something far more beautiful and profoundly troubling. “Fat City” is a novel that changes itself as it moves. Tully struggles, torn between returning to the ring and succumbing to alcoholism. One of the most vibrant and paradoxically banal sections comprises Tully’s time as a day worker reminiscent of “Grapes of Wrath;” “Tully was hardly thinking now, his mind fixed on pain and chopping and a vision of quitting time. Seeing a man go to the edge of the field, he rose and went to the foreman, who was suspicious but gave his permission. In the tall grass beside an irrigation ditch, Tully squatted a peaceful moment.” The seeming foray into social realism is actually a movement into second-order subversion; “Fat City,” even as it eschews its own genre conventions, declines shallow existential meditation in witness to the reality of the bare need to survive. Gardener’s narrative ambivalence resonates with Tully’s own casual progression toward a death that, though the reader never sees, was long-since dealt to him.The novel’s relative obscurity has several high-profile exceptions, including Walker Percy, Joan Didion and Denis Johnson. Johnson proclaims Gardener’s influence on his work in an article for Salon.com, “I got the book and read about two Stockton, California boxers who live far outside the boxing myth and deep in the sorrow and beauty of human life, a book so precisely written and giving such value to its words that I felt I could almost read it with my fingers, like Braille.” He readily acknowledges the novel’s influence on his own first novel, “Angels;” “I could see immediately that 10 years’ exile hadn’t saved me from the influence of its perfection—I’d taught myself to write in Gardner’s style, though not as well.” That novel also deals heavily in the fallout of the Flower Generation, though its essence is more directly derivative—drug abuse, madness, and poetic flourishes of violence—with stretches of American badland serving as a surrogate for the frontier, to be conquered by Greyhound.Reading “Fat City” in the summer of 2009, one is reminded of Darren Aronofsky’s film “The Wrestler,” and the enigmatic final scene; a tragic arc either clipped or stretched too thin; a pathetic hero caught suddenly with something left to lose. Ernie Munger, its clear, is a talented fighter. He is blessed preternaturally with qualities that Tully could never measure up to, and his future, it seems at the end of the novel, will at least be brighter than his coeval if he chooses to fight again. But to what end? “Ernie rose, and when the bus roared into the depot he was standing at the head of the aisle. He came lightly down the metal steps into balmy air and diesel fumes, and feeling in himself the potent allegiance of fate, he pushed open the door to the lobby, where unkempt sleepers slumped upright on the benches.” The novel, like the film, seems to end too soon: Munger, for the reader, is caught in a state of uncertainty. Whether it’s the purgatory of domesticity or the slow hell of fight-damage, Gardener gives the reader an interstitial space where the choice between the two is irrelevant.—Staff writer Ryan J.

Freshmen entering Harvard College this year may be the first to experience the new Harvard Art Museum—if it opens by its scheduled date in 2013. Originally meant to reopen in 2012, the Harvard Art Museum is the renamed, renovated collective of the Fogg and Busch-Reisinger museums. The full renovation has necessitated moving almost the entirety of their 250,000 pieces to an offsite storage facility, a change which continues to affect students and art aficionados looking to appreciate the Harvard collections. “In order to start the renovation process, the entire collection needs to be moved and the space needs to be emptied,” says Daron Manoogian, Director of Communications for the Harvard Art Museum.  “The collection move is still ongoing.” Throughout the years, additions to the original 1927 building, which includes the Fogg and Busch-Reisinger museums, have not been integrated well into the main structure, according to Manoogian. This current renovation is meant to create a more cohesive experience for visitors.  “The new addition will be integrated seamlessly into the original building,” Manoogian says.  “This way, visitors will experience the collection of all three museums [including the Sackler] in one building.”In the meantime, students are eager to view and experience the many renowned artworks in the Harvard collection. On its end, the Harvard Art Museum has been actively working to keep its connection to undergraduate life alive. Student groups such as the Harvard Art Museum Undergraduate Connection strive to keep the college community abreast of new events occurring at the museum. In addition, the museum has appointed Kelsey McNiff as the Educator for University Audiences, and is supporting programs such as the upcoming October exhibition at the Carpenter Center titled “ACT UP New York: Activism, Art and the AIDS Crisis, 1987-1993” which is specifically targeted for students.Besides involving undergraduate students, the museum has continued to welcome Harvard academics into its consideration. One example is the Sackler Museum, which has remained and will continue to remain open through construction. It unveiled an exhibition titled “Re-View” last fall, which compiled a variety of artworks from the greater Harvard collection and installed them on its fourth floor.  Although only 600 pieces of art are on display, the fourth floor also hosts a “teaching gallery,” where classes, such as History of Art and Architecture 10, can display artwork discussed in the course. “Our main goals going forward are to reach out more to undergraduate community,” Manoogian says.  “We hope to incorporate the museum more broadly into the undergraduate curriculum.”One way this is being achieved is through the initiative of Susanne Ebbinghaus and Stephan S. Wolohojian, who are co-teaching a freshman seminar course titled “Art, Objects, and the Museum” this spring.“We will be looking at the artworks themselves, as well as the history of looking at artwork,” says Ebbinghaus, a Lecturer in the Classics Department who specializes in Classical Art and Archaeology.  “There are many different ways of looking at objects, from an art historian’s point of view to an anthropologist’s point of view, and we want the students to see the museum not as just an aesthetic place, but as something they can shape themselves.”The course strives to allow freshmen to make a connection with the Harvard Art Museum so that they see the institution as an integral part of their time at Harvard, and, according to Ebbinghaus, not just a “dry, dusty place, but a place that is still changing.”Actual construction on the Harvard Art Museum is scheduled to begin this fall, if the public approvals process is completed. Groups such as the Massachusetts Historical Society and the Corporation, Harvard’s version of a Board of Directors, need to approve the renovation before it begins. Despite the inconvenience that the renovation poses for most current students who will have graduated by the time the museum reopens, Manoogian believes the change is well worth it. “This renovation is so important for our long-term liability,” Manoogian says. “It may be a short-term pain, but it is for a long-term good.”—Staff writer Marissa A.

For many people, summer is a period of relaxation and resting on one’s laurels after a year of hard work. For others, it is a chance to ambitiously push ahead and surpass previous achievements, no matter how remarkable those might have been. On the evidence of “Bitte Orca,” Dirty Projectors clearly belong to the latter camp.Having achieved a reputation as a talented but difficult to love band, the Projectors have finally settled down after nearly 10 years together and have made a thoroughly enjoyable and accessible album. Released in June, “Bitte Orca” is an album so richly textured and joyous that it succeeds as both a mainstream crossover and as a natural development for an artistically restless group.From the moment lead single “Stillness Is the Move” dropped, it was clear that Dirty Projectors were moving into new and exciting territory. The song sounds like nothing else the band has ever done before, bordering on mainstream R&B. Lead singer and songwriter Dave Longstreth restricts himself to just playing guitar and handing the vocals over to the dulcet voice of Amber Coffman. It is conventional in structure and features delightfully innocent lyrics—“From now until forever, baby / I can’t imagine anything better”—that make it a perfect anthem for separated lovers.Once the album itself was released, it became clear that the promise of “Stillness Is the Move” was just a sign of the myriad pleasures the album itself would contain. Opener “Cannibal Resource” introduces many of the elements that will feature throughout; precise guitar licks, beautiful female harmonizing, and handclaps combine to form a tight and mesmerizing whole. Album centerpiece “Useful Chamber” is another highlight. The LP’s most adventurous track, it effortlessly shifts intensity from its comfortable opening groove through violent rock outbursts and back again several times.As invigorating as the rock tracks are, the slower, more romantic tracks on “Bitte Orca” truly amaze. Following immediately after “Stillness Is the Move,” “Two Doves” is the flip-side to its predecessor’s irrepressible optimism. The romanticism is still there—“Your love, better than wine”—but now it is tinged with harsh reality: “But our bed is like a failure.” While the song is far from hopeless, it adds depth and pathos to the bliss of “Stillness Is the Move.”Though the quality diminishes slightly in the last couple of songs, “Bitte Orca” is a fascinating statement from a band that had seemed reluctant to focus their talents on straight-forward songcraft rather than the hit-or-miss tendencies of experimental rock. “There is nothing we can’t do,” declare the lovers in “Stillness Is The Move,” and it seems that, for Dirty Projectors, the same holds true. —Staff writer Chris R.

If you read Kanye West’s blog for any reason beyond pure entertainment or comedy, then you may have heard of Blind Man’s Colour. If you wait around for a couple more years, the band will be a household name amongst hipsters and beachgoers alike.The band—hailing from St. Petersburg, Florida and led by Kyle Wyss and Orhan Chettri—released their debut LP this summer after six months of steady hype brought on by Kanye and others blogging about their music. “Season Dreaming” is the product of several years worth of material, and its title and the season of its release could not be more appropriate for a group whose lifeblood is sand and salty sea.Though scores of blogs—and now magazines—like to point toward the band’s influences, which include the likes of Animal Collective and spin-off Panda Bear, Wyss and Chettri have most certainly forged a new path, incorporating elements of electronic, noise rock, experimental, and, at times, even hip-hop beats—all the while paying the utmost respect to the vibe of the Gulf Coast shoreline they grew up on. They are destined to be the fathers of an entirely new sub genre: Beach-Ethereal Electronic Rock.With their many varied elements, it would seem that Blind Man’s Colour’s music would be confused and overstuffed. But, surprisingly, the band is at its best when their many sounds converge, bringing together and maintaining the various aspects of their experimentation. Two tracks that come to mind immediately are “Anxious Place” and “Jimmy Dove.” The former moves along with a lively drumbeat and chord progression, which is simultaneously insistent and somehow loping—like waves breaking on the shore. This combined with synth effects and audible lyrics make “Anxious Place” a truly successful and catchy song.“Jimmy Dove” is a beast of an entirely differnt nature, and moving forward, the band should strongly consider making its unique sound into their calling card. The song opens with heavy, bubbling synth and a chorus of vocal “oh’s,” creating a trippy underwater effect. The lyrics then quickly burst on scene with an intensity a notch above The Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey.” The chorus is easily the highlight of the album with its hip-hop beat, strobing synth, and entrancing lyrics.Summer is almost over, so you won’t be able to enjoy Blind Man’s Colour next to a beach or pool, but they will remind you of that setting nonetheless, and for those listeners not from the bleak Northeast, help you get through the long, sunless winter.—Staff Writer Andrew F.

One of the strangest trends in contemporary rock is the tendency of middle-aged bands, often well past their artistic and commercial zenith, to release eponymous albums. Pearl Jam did it in 2006 with their eighth studio release. By the time Blur released their eponymous album in 1997, their Britpop was already a dated genre. Rivers Cuomo ’99-’06, of course, seems to call every other album “Weezer”. The motives for such a move are varied: often a return to roots, as in Pearl Jam’s case, or as a marketing gimmick to present the album as different and important. In naming their seventh album “Wilco (the Album),” Jeff Tweedy and the band seem to be announcing a realization of identity, defining their sound at an intersection of styles that they previously employed seperately.Unusually, this solid album opens with its weakest track: “Wilco (the Song)” is a forced joke that falls flat. After this misstep, however, the album proves to be a consistently enjoyable listen. Wilco’s two previous releases, 2004’s “A Ghost is Born” and 2007’s “Sky Blue Sky” alternately displayed the band’s two extremes: “A Ghost is Born” was spiked with experimental guitar noise and studio tricks, and “Sky Blue Sky” was a return to old-fashioned laid-back songwriting. In the vein of Wilco’s finest works, “Wilco (the Album)” combines the traditional and experimental. While past triumphs like 2002’s “Yankee Hotel Foxtrot” made each song a fusion of the two styles, The Album alternates experimental songs with stripped-down ones. “Bullet Black Nova” would have fit in well on “A Ghost is Born,” while “Country Disappeared” is their most straightforward piece of Americana in a decade. There are several highlights here, but none is quite so incandescent as the elegiac “One Wing,” where Tweedy accompanies a graceful melody with wistful lyrics: “I always knew this would be our fate / This is what happens when we separate / This is what happens to all dead weight, eventually.” Like Joe Strummer, Tweedy has always been able to coax remarkable amounts of empathy and emotion out of his one-octave range, and his subtle vocal gifts shine throughout this album. Yet the greatest attraction is the guitar interplay of Tweedy and Nels Cline. Few guitar duos in rock history have their ability to delight both guitar enthusiast and casual fan. “Wilco (the Album)” is not quite a towering masterpiece, and some of its more ambitious moments may well be considered missteps. But the album’s many peaceful, laid-back gems are testaments to a band that, after years of conflicting ambitions and changing lineups, has finally settled down. If it ages as well as the underrated “Sky Blue Sky,” it will certainly come to be regarded as a career highlight.—Staff writer Keshava D. Guha can be reached at kdguha@fas.harvard.edu.

Amidst the hundreds of R&B hopefuls that “American Idol” seems to produce every season—many of whom are more prone to howling than singing—the show has proven it can unearth a few gems as well. In Season 7, that gem was Brooke White, who, although placing fifth in the overall competition, brought new life to the show with her folksy yet sophisticated vocals and self-accompaniment. With these tools at the ready and a much larger following in tow, White has delightfully crafted her second album (the first since her American Idol appearance), “High Hopes and Heartbreaks.”Fans of White may have become tired of hearing her compared to Carly Simon and Carole King, but there is really no better way to describe her. A gentle rasp gives her vocals a down to earth vibe, reflecting the sense of serenity that set apart these celebrated predecessors. The lyrics, though not the album’s main selling point, convey a stirring honesty. In “Sometimes Love,” she sings, “Sometimes love is an empty invitation / Sometimes love is a word that’s used in vain / Sometimes love is just something that people say everyday / And I don’t want it that way.” The songstress certainly does not provide us with another “You’re So Vain,” but she manages to hold her own nonetheless.Another standout is White’s cover of “Use Somebody,” the recent hit by Southern rockers Kings of Leon. Her version, though not hugely different from its chart-topping counterpart, gives the song a more whimsical quality, and her own easygoing tone provides a breath of fresh air distinct from the Kings’ more angst-ridden interpretation.Though each song on White’s album deserves acclaim for some aspect or another, the title song warrants the greatest praise. Here, White truly perfects her style; the Simon and King influences are certainly present vocally, but the song is contemporary and even jazzy. The addition of the electric guitar on this track—most others feature acoustic or piano—gives the necessary 2009 feel that persists as the album continues. Over the course of this one song, White reminds her listeners that although she may be influenced by these illustrious artists of the 70s, she is, herself, an artist of the present. With these triumphs, “High Hopes and Heartbreaks” is a remarkably tasteful juxtaposition of past and present styles.

Summer, aside from being the hot season, is the playlist season: one for the backyard party, one for the drive to the beach, one for drinking on the curb at two in the morning, maybe one for that late night chat with the special lady friend. But for the extra lazy summer days when iTunes is too much of a hassle, “Ambivalence Avenue” is your one-stop shop for all of your summer needs. After a series of meandering electronic albums for backpack rap label Mush, British producer Stephen Wilkinson, aka Bibio, has taken a turn towards the pop. And despite corralling sounds ranging from Brazilian street music to trip-hop to Jose Gonzalez folk, Bibio has put out a colorful and surprisingly cohesive album, one of this summer’s best.For a producer whose output has mostly focused on heavy, introspective beats, the ease with which Wilkinson creates slower, warmer melodies is impressive. While the found sound production aesthetic of his past work is still noticeable, the increased presence of electric guitar allows the structure of each track to catch hold. Filtered through a resonating old gramophone-type effect, the guitar acts sort of like sun glare, transfiguring the simple chord progressions and also making them perfect sleep music. “Lovers Carvings,” in particular, features ideally lustrous guitar work that gets along well with a late afternoon outdoor nap. Wilkinson’s real skill, though, is crafting the faultless head nod tracks that fill up the rest of the album. Through meticulously recorded and assembled sounds and synthetic beats, Bibio lands hits in an incredibly diverse array of styles. The title track is classic 70s Brazilian-sounding clap-along gold—the kind of song that you wish would follow you around all day. “Jealous of Roses,” the song that follows, runs through a similar vein, featuring falsetto funk vocals and an addictively choppy beat that is perfect for your “Shaft” moments. Also prominent on the album are textured Dabrye and J Dilla-type hip-hop break beats that, while not as catchy as the other tracks, do have bits of melody that seem to sneak up on listeners.  Unlike most of his past releases, this album does feature a significant amount of vocal work, but this takes a back seat to the beautiful beats that define the music. Tying together an ambitious range of sounds with a newfound knack for poppy melody, Stephen Wilkinson served up all of the sounds of summer in one multi-course meal.—Staff writer Ross S.

Fiery Furnaces’ eigth studio album, “I’m Going Away,” is, appropriately enough, a departure. For some bands, that might suggest an unprecedented foray into weirdness, but for the Furnaces, that means abandoning experimental tendencies for unexpected accessibility.The album opens at high energy, but the frenetic driving beat of the title track soon relaxes into a calm, agreeable record. An early highlight, “The End Is Near,” features a bluesy piano riff refreshing for its childlike simplicity. The guitar breakdown in follow-up track “Drive to Dallas” is one any shredder could be proud of, and its improbable fluctuations in energy showcase lead vocalist Eleanor Friedberger’s distinctive voice.At the Furnaces’ best, their songs sound like an exploration of the most basic building blocks of pop songs. It’s reverse engineering with little concern for polish or production quality. Yet while weirder bands don’t mind sounding abrasive in pursuit of something loftier, Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger manage to pull off their eccentricity with good-natured aplomb. And as unusual as their work is, the Fiery Furnaces never allow themselves to get lost amidst the smoke and mirrors of a novelty album. Even on “Charmaine Champagne”—the album’s weakest track—there’s an abundance of ridiculous lyrics (“She’s gonna get me folked up, fairly beat”) and honky tonk piano, but they mesh together spectacularly, part of an unlikely master plan.The second half of the album falls off a bit into tracks with less distinction, but there still exists a plentiful and varied garage rock buffet within. There’s more than a little bite in Eleanor’s voice in “Staring at the Steeple,” pairing it nicely with the wacky glut of hammer-ons in “Keep Me in the Dark” or “Cups and Punches,” which comes complete with a few seconds of mildly disturbing background screaming.This album meets the Furnaces’ standard of obscure, funny lyrics, but it’s melodically stripped-down and uncomplicated—which, considering the alienating quality of some of their more challenging records, is a nice change. “I’m Going Away” is an easy album to like, and a perfect soundtrack to a lazy summer.

There was something different about the resurrection of Dinosaur Jr. even from its abstract beginnings. Before Pavement brought the slacker ethos to its natural, albeit eccentric climax, the reformed hardcore punks J. Mascis and Lou Barlow, along with drummer Murph, sculpted murky, long-range guitar workouts for the laid-back and the incidentally employed. Mascis’ twangy intonation rendered the kind of vocal performance that seemed as surprised as the listener with the craggy and uncompromisingly melodic. Not unlike the generation of grunge bands it inspired, it never seemed meant to last. Well-beloved but critically understated in general, the band was, for a time, the middle-child of indie rock’s late-eighties inception; robbed both of Sonic Youth’s extended-career veneration and the Pixies’ cult-pop status, Dinosaur Jr. was expected to produce a single masterpiece—namely 1987’s “You’re Living All Over Me,”—and languish into its prescribed stoner-rock loveseat. The alleged indignity with which the original lineup dispersed (Mascis reportedly fired bassist Barlow without ever actually telling Barlow after “Bug” in 1988; Barlow would find renewed underground success with his Sebadoh and Folk Implosion projects) made a true reunion unlikely.That’s probably what made their reunion and resurgence—marked by the astounding “Beyond,” one of the best albums of 2007 hands-down, and now the excellent “Farm”—so satisfying. Dinosaur Jr., the band with a history and even a name that implies a nostalgic relegation to the past, isn’t just making music again. This band is making music as good as its best.The expectations around every Dinosaur Jr. album are, happily the same as ever: variations on the same things at which the band has always excelled. Mascis’ voice still quakes, perhaps more age-appropriately. Murph’s drums still explode with cymbal-work. Barlow’s bass still fills out each song with wall-like intensity. “Ocean In The Way” glides with the same freefalling, if more sedated grace of the vintage “Sludgefeast.” The more extended pieces, “Said The People” and “I Don’t Want To Go There,” a combined 16 minutes and change and the longest of the band’s career, are hypnotic if a bit indulgent, bristling with Mascis’ enthusiasm for lengthy solo workouts that the fans will always welcome. Their weight is balanced nimbly with a handful of brisk, melodic pop songs among which are “There’s No Here” and “See You.” Barlow’s songwriting contributions, usually comparatively minor, and always a bit heavy-handed thematically, punctuate Mascis’ set nicely, particularly the exhilarating closer, “Imagination Blind.”But the prize still belongs to Mascis, whose songwriting seems perfectly attuned to the chemistry that the trio had developed, weirdly uninterrupted after nearly two decades apart. Nowhere is this more true than on “I Want You To Know,” a blissfully heavy blast of lovesick joy that’s just as easily straight out of the 80s vaults. In the end, the only difference between “Farm” and its immediate predecessor is the subtle tone of satisfaction; having emerged into yet another creative groove, this record lacks the hints of ragged desperation that made “Beyond” just a shade more wonderful. But don’t call “Farm” a holding pattern. Call it cruise-control.—Staff writer Ryan J. Meehan can be reached at rmeehan@fas.harvard.edu.

Few movies released this summer have aroused as much critical debate as “Inglourious Basterds.” Celebrated by some as a masterful return to form by its genius of a director, attacked by others for its immaturity and inhumanity, the movie has received little neutral sentiment. That “Inglourious Basterds” would attract great debate is unsurprising. Director Quentin Tarantino, the enfant terrible of Hollywood, has always attracted criticism for the violence and racism with which his characters go about their lives. World War Two era France, the setting for his latest film, brings with it inherent controversy. This is only strengthened by a cast of characters that includes a Nazi Jew-Hunter, a Jewish fugitive intent on exacting revenge on her German oppressors, and a battalion of Jewish soldiers whose sole purpose is to kill (and scalp) as many Nazi soldiers as possible. Its morals are indeed at times debatable, but its numerous merits are not.The eponymous Nazi hunters (led by Lt. Aldo Raine, played by the excellent Brad Pitt) provide much of the film’s entertainment value but are not its most interesting feature. The most remarkable strand of the plot follows the unnervingly charming SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) in his quest to hunt down the Jews of France. The opening scene of the movie consists of little more than a 15-minute long conversation between Landa and a French dairy farmer, Perrier LaPadite. Slowly and inevitably, Landa breaks down LaPadite’s resistance, reducing him to a quivering wreck and forcing him to surrender the Jewish family hiding in his cellar to be slaughtered. The brutality of the scene is shocking, but the power of Waltz’s performance and the tension of the dialogue make it a superb opening.The acting is flawless across the cast (has there ever been a poor performance in a Tarantino movie?); Waltz has rightly received the majority of the plaudits for his stunning and terrifyingly likeable portrayal of Landa, but there are numerous other standouts. Mélanie Laurent particularly shines as Shosanna Dreyfus, the only survivor of the opening massacre, convincingly alternating between terror at the prospect of encountering Landa and extraordinary bitterness at the way she has been treated by the Germans.As much as the characters contribute, the small details and Tarantino’s directorial vision are what make “Inglourious Basterds” so enjoyable. Samuel L. Jackson’s voiceover on the flammability of nitrate films, the brash and always entertaining soundtrack—highlighted by David Bowie’s “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)”—the numerous nods to film history, and many other minor but entertaining additions help make the film feel more vibrant and imaginative than any Tarantino flick since “Pulp Fiction.”Despite all these triumphs, however, the movie still lays itself open to criticism on numerous fronts. It is quite clear, however, that Tarantino could not care less. Yes, the violence is unnecessary. Yes, the plot disregards historical accuracy. Yes, the significance of Jews killing Nazis is completely unexplored and the moral questions it raises wholly unanswered. But these issues are not what “Inglourious Basterds” is about. As with all his movies, Tarantino sets out to entertain his viewers, to pay homage to his favorite films, and to have fun. He does not make deep movies, and has no interest in delivering any kind of message. “Inglourious Basterds” may be lightweight, but that is only appropriate for yet another feather in Tarantino’s illustrious cap.—Staff writer Chris R. Kingston can be reached at kingston@fas.harvard.edu.

America is obsessed with food. In the past couple of years, Michael Pollan’s “In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto” topped the New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller List for six weeks; Wal-Mart started selling organic milk; Robert Kenner’s documentary “Food, Inc.” revealed the horrors of large-scale agricultural food production in the U.S.; and Michelle Obama planted a vegetable garden at the White House. In “Julie & Julia,” however, the guilt that often accompanies eating is left by the wayside. The main characters aren’t locavores, flexitarians, pescetarians, or ovo-lacto-vegetarians. Instead, director Nora Ephron presents cooking and food as enjoyable—inducing pleasure rather than peccability. The film chronicles two women’s journeys of self-discovery: a bored housewife, Julia Child (Meryl Streep), gleefully bests male chefs at Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris and writes the revolutionary “Mastering the Art of French Cooking,” while Julie Powell (Amy Adams), frustrated with her dead-end cubicle job and nursing an ambition to become a writer, cooks—and blogs—her way through all of Child’s recipes 50 years later. The two storylines are parallel but totally separate, and Child’s carries the film. In the 1960s, Child was a beacon of hope for housewives who watched her TV show, “The French Chef,” and read her book. She made haute cuisine accessible, encouraging women to deviate beyond Jell-O molds and to risk failure in order to achieve culinary—and personal—triumphs. Child is earnest and fearless, but also human; we see her emotional suffering after failing to conceive with her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci). The two share a passionate relationship, and the viewer inevitably falls in love with the 6’2” powerhouse as well as her understanding partner. Powell, however, does not inspire her online readers; instead she feeds her self-pity with their attention. “It’s like a thousand people have this... this connection with me. If I didn’t write every day, they would be so disappointed,” she whines to her husband. “They would live,” he answers with thinly veiled frustration. “It would really upset them,” she counters. “They depend on me.” After graduating from Amherst, where she was the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine, Powell self-indulgently undergoes a turning-30 crisis. Ephron cuts Adams’ signature long auburn hair into an unattractive shag-mullet-bob hybrid and dresses her in the 20-something’s uniform of Anthropologie skirts, ripped Levi’s, and slip-on Vans in an attempt to make her post-graduation crisis seem relevant. The result is a character that might be relatable but certainly isn’t likeable. She complains to her patient husband about hating their apartment, her job, and even her friends. After he encourages her to start the blog, she complains about that, too.Ephron’s intentions are clear, especially because Powell melodramatically narrates them out loud; “I was drowning, and [Julia] pulled me out of the water.” One female’s self-empowerment facilitated another’s. Through the intertwined non-relationship Ephron revisits and successfully renews America’s passion for Julia Child and for the shameless love of eating. Streep single-handedly elevates the film from clunky to thoughtful and refined—just like Julia’s  boeuf bourginon.

For the sixth and third-to-last time, we enter J.K. Rowling’s enchanting cinematic realm of magic and mischief. But a new and sinister fog looms heavily over “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.” From the film’s opening scenes, in which Death Eaters whiz by like toxic, black fumes across Britain’s bright skies and cause chaos throughout London, the malevolence that will characterize the rest of the Potter series becomes painfully evident. Although this installment works largely as a transition for the two-part finale, the strengths of David Yates’ directing and Steve Kloves’ script make this Potter film the strongest and most entertaining to date. In “Half-Blood Prince,” Voldemort is back and more powerful than ever. In addition to wreaking havoc throughout both muggle and wizarding worlds, the Dark Lord has entrusted the young Draco Malfoy with a daunting assignment that endangers the lives of multiple characters throughout the school year. Voldemort’s most formidable opponent, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, has begun to show signs of increasing fragility, ominously symbolized by his injured hand. Hogwarts, once seen as a rare safe haven, begins to lose much of its structural integrity.Despite the film’s grim tone, the storyline isn’t all danger and darkness. After a two-year absence, Quidditch is back, and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) joins the Gryffindor team as Keeper. Comic relief comes in the form of new characters, most notably Ron’s annoyingly perky girlfriend Lavender Brown (Jessie Caves) and the arrogant Cormac McLaggen (Freddie Stroma), who compulsively chases after Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). Both in and out of the classroom, the Potter characters learn to brew love potions as relationships foment between Ron and Hermione as well as Harry and Ginny. The acting in “Half-Blood Prince” is at its series peak. Although greatness can be expected from the giants of British acting that appear throughout the film—Alan Rickman as Snape, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, Helena Bohman Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, among others—the most surprising depth is seen in the younger actors, especially Watson and Tom Felton, who plays Draco. The inner turmoil caused by his burdensome task allows Felton to express a broader range of emotions than in previous films. Potter fans searching for a close adaptation of the sixth book should steer clear of “Half-Blood Prince.” Kloves has exercised more artistic freedom than ever in this film, cutting memorable storylines (including trips through the pensieve to Voldemort’s tragic childhood and family history), and introducing entirely new scenes (such as when the Death Eaters attack the Weasleys’ home). But overall, Kloves’ changes contribute to a much more compact film; “Deathly Hallows” is the first in the series to progress at an adequate pace rather than at the speed of a Golden Snitch. Although the Potter films continue to mature in both quality and subject matter, now catering more toward adult audiences, the saga will remain emblematic of an entire generation’s childhood. On July 15th, 2011—the release date of the eighth and final film, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows”—these fans will greet the theaters with mixed emotions as the series comes to an epic conclusion, simultaneously marking their unofficial induction into adulthood.—Staff writer Andres A.

As the lights dim and you notice that you are surrounded by geriatrics, you may wonder why you skipped “(500) Days of Summer” for a documentary about an actress you’ve never heard of who bears a striking resemblance to your cousin Yetta. But make no mistake, director Aviva Kempner’s “Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg” is an entertaining and thoughtful examination of the fascinating life of Gertrude Berg—a writer, actress, and all-around trailblazer who, unfortunately for our generation, has been largely forgotten.Never a suffragette or a flapper, Gertrude berg was a refined, upper middle-class mother of two, and a breakthrough female leader, rising against societal expectations for both Jews and women to become a wildly successful celebrity. After finding herself dissatisfied with mundane voiceover work, Berg created her own radio show, “The Rise of the Goldbergs” (later shortened to “The Goldbergs”). Centered on the life of a lower East Side Jewish family of immigrant parents and first-generation American children, the show was a national hit. Berg played the doting mother, Molly Goldberg, while also producing and writing every script for the show that ran Monday through Friday from 1929-1945. The radio program later spawned a television show of the same name, which won Berg the first-ever Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy. Through an array of colorful interviews from Berg’s close family and longtime fans, including “All in the Family” creator Norman Lear and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Kempner communicates the determination and warmth that made Berg, as one 1930s poll revealed, the second-most popular woman in America (just behind Eleanor Roosevelt). Although her show was clearly about a Jewish family, the Goldbergs’ laughter and struggle were accessible and comforting to immigrants throughout the nation, even in the depths of the Great Depression. The humor found in stumbling over English words, the hope of a better future for one’s children, the communal compassion that grew out of many tenement neighborhoods—these were familiar pictures of the American experience for those of the first generation, and Kempner contextualizes this environment with rich footage from old film reels and television clips. While a movie composed largely of interviews from adoring fans and samples of Berg’s best radio and television work may seem like a rose-colored, almost sappy celebration of her life, Kempner manages to keep the film from drowning in sentiment. True, it never tackles certain contradictions of Berg’s life and career, including how a woman who was in many ways the personification of strong female leadership won her success by embodying the traditional mother and housewife. Yet, a subject as fascinating and as overlooked as Gertrude Berg all but begs Kempner and her audience to indulge in this almost uniformly positive portrayal. It’s difficult to find fault with a woman who raised a family while writing her own award-winning show for over 25 years—decades before the Women’s Liberation movement began to take shape.

Fusing the genres of introspective drama and explosive action calls for a delicate balance, but director Neill Blomkamp’s protagonist in “District 9”—who becomes a human-alien hybrid—reflects the success of such half-breeds. After being assigned to assist in relocating 2 million alien refugees from their city slum to a distant concentration camp, Wikus van de Merwe (the impressive Sharlto Copley) is forced to help the aliens escape the planet. With the same seemingly magnetic pull of District 9—the aforementioned slum on the outskirts of Johannesburg—the movie deftly draws the audience in with conflicting tales of message and mayhem.This is not, however, an easily struck balance. While the action is terrific and the drama is top shelf, each is potentially hindered by the other’s presence. Copley’s acting and the combined CGI innovation of Image Engine and producer Peter Jackson’s Weta Workshop foster an unbelievable amount of sympathy for the strange insectoid aliens, but this achievement is often clouded by Blomkamp’s willingness to use his creations as gory decoration. Similarly, those who see “District 9” for the violent, hedonistic ride will occasionally be put off by how heavy the plot can get as Blomkamp expounds on the limits and contradictions of human compassion.The aliens are the film’s greatest accomplishment, equal parts pitiable and repulsive. While they are horribly mistreated, their behavior often seems to deserve nothing better. It is here that the film truly makes its point. Despite the seemingly barbarous and insensate nature of the aliens, the viewer still feels that they are undeserving of the cruelty heaped upon them. It is by making the aliens so physically and socially disparate from humans that the director reveals their humanity as well as our own. What is most impressive is that the two central and most sympathetic aliens are not necessarily the reason for this; the executions and beatings of anonymous aliens emerge equally moving. The central alien and his son serve as the focal point for our sympathy, but they never monopolize it; despite appearances to the contrary, everyone is worth saving.Constrained by length and conflicting genres, Blomkamp must settle for a snapshot of this fascinating world, rather than a complete explication. This is a tantalizing glimpse of the possibilities of his fiction, not a full demonstration of them. We are presented with the realities of life on the ground, and since things are the way they are, questions of cause are futile—the only question now is how to move forward. It is with this sentiment that the film both begins and concludes. The curse of past, unchangeable error haunts the world, and all that remains are our fearful glances toward the future.

The Harvard Crimson: How did ‘Timbre and Flux’ come about?Larissa D. Koch: I graduated last March and I had enough repertory that I’d made while I was here that I could do an evening of work that I had created as an undergrad. I’ve been really lucky that I’ve continued in the dance scene here through teaching so I presented this idea to the Dance Program that if I could find the people to do a concert, would it be possible for the Program to host my dance company. They said yes.Since there’s such competition between the dance companies and groups at the Dance Center, I wanted something to complement and not compete with what other student groups were doing. So we’ve organized and rehearsed all summer, and we’ve managed to put together a really wonderful concert.THC: Why ‘Timbre and Flux’?LDK: I wanted a title that represented both music and dance elements so I thought about what makes music music and what makes dance dance. Music wouldn’t exist without sound and dance without motion so I thought of the qualities of sound and motion and that’s where I got timbre and flux.THC: Can you talk about the pieces in the concert and the focus on collaboration?LDK: All of this repertory except for one piece was preexisting. The new piece is a preview of something that I’ve been invited by the Ballet Company to do for the Loeb Mainstage in collaboration with Hans Tutschku, who is a wonderful electroacoustic composer. The ballet company wanted to pair choreographers with people on the music end. Hans and I have peripherally worked with each other already so it seemed like a natural fit. He’s a very responsive composer, both in terms of what he’s doing musically and also in terms of being aware of how the movement and music interact together.I’m also restaging a piece that Bong-Inh Koh and I conceived of together involving the cello not just being an accompanist but being a part of the piece, so the cellist is on the stage. The act of playing the cello involves really beautiful movement, and I really wanted to make sure it wasn’t missed.There is another piece I originally choreographed to recorded music but I’ve always wanted to do it live because I’ve been enamored of the classical guitar for a while. There’s a very human element to having live music that I think gives a dance piece something more when you have the musician present. I’m a really musically- driven choreographer, so I’m trying to do everything I can to make the music in the concert represented as important, because it’s so important to me choreographically.THC: What do you mean by ‘musically driven’?LDK: Music inspires movement in me. I’ll fall in love with a piece of music and listen to it again and again and that’s how I get my ideas. It starts with music. I could have an idea for a piece conceptually but before I have the music it doesn’t go anywhere.THC: Compared to what kind of choreography?LDK: Merce Cunningham is a classic example of the opposite. Merce would generate movement ideas completely independently of music and sometimes the dancers wouldn’t hear the music until the night of the concert. You would have them happen at the same time and whatever would happen, would happen, so a lot of it was… not accidental, but incidental. It also meant it was different every night. It’s a very different way of thinking about choreography.The guest choreographers who I asked to work with me have a similar sensibility to me in the way they choreograph. They’re very musical choreographers, and their movement is very thoughtful in its musicality and crafted very carefully in a way that works with the music.THC: What has been your hardest challenge this summer in organizing this concert?LDK: The hardest thing for me has been adjusting the way that the process of preparing for a concert feels and is for the dancers, because by nature, it’s different over the summer. Being able to rehearse with some people on a weekly basis and then having some people jump in at the last minute has been very different from what I’m accustomed to. Everyone had to have the resources they needed to feel prepared, so for example, the dancer who was in China all summer had a copy of the piece she was going to do on video. There was a lot more studying involved. It was much less self-contained.THC: What’s ahead for you?LDK: I’m going to be a teaching assistant for an introduction to choreography class that is offered by the Committee on Dramatic Arts and taught by Professor Elizabeth Bergmann. I’m choreographing for the show on the Mainstage. I’ve applied to a couple of choreography festivals that are invited. I’m applying to medical school.THC: How do you balance your choreography and academic goals?LDK: For a long time I thought it had to be an either/or kind of thing. But there are living examples of how dance can coexist with the medical field. For example, through CPIC (Center for Public Interest Careers), I had the opportunity to mentor with a physician who runs a youth orchestra with her husband.Figuring out how to navigate how to do both is tricky, but you have to give yourself permission to take one and put it in the backseat. It can be hard. People have exacting standards for themselves and sometimes there’s a feeling that if you can’t do it at peak, you shouldn’t be doing it at all.Finding a happy medium has been challenging, but it has also been a good exercise. When you let something go for a while you get to rediscover what you really love about it, which is something you don’t get to do if you focus too hard—you become a little myopic. It’s been a blessing in disguise to have to let dance go from time to time. I’ve rediscovered why I’d loved it and I’d forgotten and didn’t even know I’d forgotten until I rediscovered it.—­Denise J. Xu

In a summer filled with justifiable acclaim for “Inglourious Basterds,” another war movie snuck onto the scene and captured audiences with an almost surreal attention to detail rather than with a clever rewrite of history.Written by American journalist Mark Boal, the script for “The Hurt Locker” is based on stories from his time covering a bomb squad in Iraq. Jeremy Renner (“The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,” “28 Weeks Later”) leads the film’s fictionalized diffusing team with a stunning performance as Sergeant First Class William James, a bomb-man with a death wish. The plot, essentially composed of almost journalistic vignettes, traces the ups and downs of everyday soldier life. Even the most banal serves as a suspenseful      contrast to ticking bombs and explosions. When James confuses a dead boy’s bomb-strapped body for the young Iraqi kid he’d befriended, his reaction is both sincere and destructive—like no shortage of other situations in Iraq. The movement from the commonplace to the unbelievable creates a surreality similar to that of “Apocalypse Now.” In one scene, a soldier almost annoyingly complains about his duty; immediately after, he is forced to wipe fresh blood from bullets so they can be fired. The effect of such shifts is not only urgency, but a kind of dark humor. Though it may be hard to decide where “Hurt Locker” fits into the canon of war cinema, it is the most gripping American attempt at the genre since “Saving Private Ryan” and easily the best film to date made on the current war in Iraq. A large part of its success lies in the fact that it doesn’t proselytize. Unlike previous Iraq War films like “Stop-Loss,” which patronizes viewers with takeaways they already agree with, “Hurt Locker” disguises its message with subtlety, focusing on the difficult lives of soldiers and culture clash rather than anything as distant as politics or presidents.  Renner’s portrayal of a bomb-diffusing, cigarette-smoking madman is perhaps the best male performance of 2009. The rest of his team includes characters played by Anthonie Mackie and Brian Geraghty, the latter essentially reprising his deer-in-the-headlights role in “Jarhead.” Ralph Fiennes and David Morse also turn in amusing cameo roles.The biggest round of applause, though, should be reserved for director Kathryn Bigelow (“Strange Days,” “Blue Steel”), who conducts her scenes with almost scientific precision.  One 10-minute sniper standoff in particular showcases Bigelow’s deft mastery of timing. The gap between the bullet’s crack and its impact creates a moment of suspended time, leaving the viewer hovering in a tense area between cause and effect.  This moment of uncertainty provides an adrenaline rush for both the audience and Sgt. James, a testament to the subtlety of the film’s emotional power.—Staff writer Andrew F.

The Cambridge Chronicle has taken issue with the city police department’s restrictions on public records.The local newspaper has filed an appeal with the Massachusetts Secretary of State’s office, charging that the Cambridge Police Department’s report of last Sunday’s alleged attack of a Harvard graduate student wrongly withheld information about the suspect and the exact whereabouts of the incident.Chronicle News Editor David Harris said that since the beginning of summer, the police department has been reluctant to provide information on police dispatch locations and suspect identities in their reports.On Sunday, a Harvard graduate student had her iPhone stolen while walking on Putnam Avenue. The Cambridge Police Department’s report provided to the Chronicle identified the suspect as a black male between the ages of 20 and 24, but further information was withheld. In an article published on Wednesday, the Chronicle reported on what it termed the Cambridge Police Department’s “new policy” of withholding information.The police department holds reports—part of the public record—and usually makes them available only for in-person inquiries. As part of an informal agreement with the Chronicle, the department faxes reports to the newspaper upon request. In both cases, the department reviews the documents and redacts any information that might conflict with an ongoing investigation, said the police department’s legal adviser Kelly Downes.Downes said that in this regard, the department is acting within Massachusetts public records law.“We have not changed our policy,” Downes said. “Releasing information about suspects is determined on a case by case basis.” The Cambridge Police Department made national news this summer after it was accused of racial profiling in the arrest of Harvard Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. The Crimson reported the arrest after reviewing the police department report on the incident. But Harris said the restrictions on public information had nothing to do with the press surrounding the Gates episode, and in fact preceded the incident.“Certain information wasn’t being provided,” Harris said. “It’s kind of a slow erosion of public information.”“We think it’s the public’s right to know,” he said.Earlier this summer, Lindsay Kallander, a junior at Suffolk University, was mugged along the Charles River. Based on her experience, she would have felt more comfortable with the dissemination of the suspects’ information in the incident Sunday, she told The Crimson yesterday.—Staff writer Noah S.

Harvard Business School has admitted 115 students—nine more than last year—to its 2+2 Program, Managing Director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid Deirdre C. Leopold said in an interview yesterday. 
Applications to the program increased significantly, to 843 from 630 in 2008. The number of students admitted also increased from 106, but Leopold said that there is no direct correlation between the number of applicants and the number admitted.
The Business School admissions staff mounted a marketing campaign over the past year, visiting nearly 60 undergraduate schools as of last spring.
At an April information session in Boylston Hall, Leopold emphasized that “this program was not designed for Harvard College.” Still, the 27 Harvard College students admitted represent an increase over last year’s number, when 22 entered the program.
“That is not a managed number,” Leopold said. “We are looking for people best suited to this program.” She noted that students in the program come from 51 colleges and universities.
The 2+2 Program, now in its second year, allows students to apply to HBS in their junior year. Those accepted work for two years after their college graduations before entering the Business School. This year’s 2+2 “cohort” will graduate from HBS in 2014.
According to Leopold, the program was designed to attract students for whom business school is not a traditional choice, such as those interested in science. Of the students notified of their acceptance on Tuesday, over 50 percent have educational backgrounds in engineering and natural sciences, according to a profile Leopold released to The Crimson.
Students from last year’s cohort have found positions at organizations as various as MTV Networks, Cisco Systems, and Teach for America, Leopold said.
Stephanie M. Kaplan ’10, who was admitted to the program, is hoping to spend her two years developing an online media startup, named Her Campus, that she began last year. After being admitted to HBS, she says she feels “more comfortable taking that risk now.”
Caleb L. Weatherl ’10, an admitted student and economics concentrator who has been heavily involved in politics on campus, said that no matter what his career goals are, an HBS education is valuable. Weatherl is also a Crimson editorial editor.
“The great thing about business school, particularly Harvard, is it certainly teaches a lot about business, but in some sense it’s a leadership school,” Weatherl said.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology will discontinue its little-used dial-up internet service starting Sept. 30 in an effort to cut costs.The dial-up service was first offered over 20 years ago, when phone-based modems were considered cutting edge, and has since become something of a relic among Harvard internet users. Current usage has dwindled to an average of two users a day—a level at which FAS IT “can no longer justify the large expense of maintaining the service,” said spokesman Noah S. Selsby ’94.Almost all of the dial-up users were faculty and staff accessing the modem pool from their homes, Selsby said.Citing departmental policy, Selsby declined to reveal how much breathing room FAS IT would gain from cutting the service, but said the savings were “substantial.”Faster alternatives, such as DSL and cable modem, are now the standard, Selsby said, and FAS IT has sent notifications to every account that has used its dial-up service in the last six months.FAS IT administrators made the decision to cut the service earlier this summer, when all departments and units across the Faculty were combing through their budgets. After announcing last spring that they would have to close a $220 million deficit over the space of two years, FAS administrators have only identified $77 million worth of budget cuts that are set for immediate implementation. Should users wish to “check their e-mail very, very slowly,” Selsby said with a laugh, third-party dial-up service providers, such as www.netzero.net and www.earthlink.net, remain available.To reach the FAS IT Service Desk, call 617-495-9000 or e-mail help@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer June Q.

Former Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan Meghan L. O’Sullivan has been appointed the Jeane Kirkpatrick Professor of International Affairs at the Kennedy School, the school announced this week. O’Sullivan, an expert on Middle Eastern politics who served as a special assistant to president George W. Bush and helped implement the Bush administration’s surge strategy in the Iraq war, has been appointed as a professor of practice. The five-year renewable professorship generally is given to those with extensive political or diplomatic experience outside of academics.“Meghan brings a combination of a really rare intelligence with practical, on the ground experience,” said Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75. “What we are trying to do at the Kennedy School is to combine the world of scholarship with the world of practice, and Meghan bridges that boundary beautifully.”The school has also recently added two other professors of practice with international diplomacy expertise, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and former U.S. Ambassador to NATO R. Nicholas Burns as well as British diplomat Rory Stewart.Ellwood also said that O’Sullivan’s field of expertise is particularly important for the Kennedy School, as “this is an incredibly important time in the Middle East and South Asia.” Last spring the school hosted Gen. David H. Petraeus, a friend of O’Sullivan’s who was also instrumental in developing the troop surge in Iraq.O’Sullivan has spent time working on both Middle Eastern and South Asian issues, leading strategic policy reviews in Afghanistan and Iraq and serving as the National Security Council’s Senior Director for Strategic Planning for Southwest Asia.Ellwood also lauded O’Sullivan for being well-liked among Kennedy School students.The Middle East expert is currently teaching “Geopolitics of Energy” and “Decision Making in Recent Crises: The Formulation and Consequences of Key Decisions on Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.”A graduate of Georgetown and Oxford, O’Sullivan previously worked in academia as an adjunct professor at Georgetown while serving as a fellow at the Brookings Institute from 1998-2001.—Staff writer Lauren D.

As students started shopping, classes were packed all around—often overflowing into hallways—with a disproportionate number of these courses counting toward the Core Curriculum. Though College administrators were able to predict that General Education classes would be large since freshmen have just one "U.S. in the World" class to look at this fall, they may have forgotten that there are still all those sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are under a curriculum that has already "shuffled off its mortal coil," in English professor James Simpson's words over a year ago.
So you may not expect a course on classical Chinese ethical and political theory to attract that much attention. Sure, we all know about Confucius, and maybe Sun Tzu too. But considering Harvard students' tendency to take eight classes with overlapping subject matter in order to pad their GPAs, it's surprising that this East Asian studies class  had students packed and overflowing into the hallway (and about half the students there had to stand). But wait for it, wait for it: its official title is Moral Reasoning 78, and only two other Moral Reasoning classes are being offered this fall. While this may force students to branch out,   the options depend entirely on the specialties of the few professors who are still interested in teaching in the Core Curriculum.
Another professor whose course flier declares, "Wake up, it's the 7th century!" (for History 1040: "The Fall of the Roman Empire") is also teaching in the ancient Core. Though this Historical Study B class doesn't double-count toward Gen Ed, about 20 people couldn't get in, and upperclassmen were flooding the hallways to such an extent that one lone freshman girl on the window-sill had to ask, "Can freshmen take this too?"
Another tip to find out which classes are overflowing is to see which ones have fliers everywhere. Since Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 26: "Gender and Performance" had fliers (along with a 4.8 Q Guide score) and counts toward both Gen Ed and the Core (Literature and Arts B), it hit the jackpot.  Students were pouring out of the hallway onto the steps of Emerson Hall.
The overflow list continues, after the jump:
English 182: "Science Fiction," which counts toward Literature and Arts A.
Music 2: "Foundations of Tonal Music," which counts toward Literature and Arts B.
Astronomy 17: "Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy," which counts toward Science A.
English 168d: "Postwar American and British Fiction," which counts toward Literature and Arts A. (Although the crowd in this class probably has more to do with the headlining professor, the inimitable James Wood, than the fact that it counts as a core class. Let's be honest—is anyone going to compete with a flock of fawning English concentrators when all they really want is an easy A in a core?)
Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 37: "Introduction to the Bible in the Humanities and the Arts," which counts toward Literature and Arts A. (Granted, this is Gordon Teskey, and he's awesome.)
Whether you're in Gen Ed or the Core, chances are there aren't enough classes to choose from, even though the subject matter is still pretty specific.  So, happy shopping.

L. loves coffee; E. loves fruit. You know how that goes. Okay, maybe you don't. The point is that L. knows what she's dealing with when she's standing in line at the local Starbucks, and E. would much rather order a carton of chocolate milk—or a hot chocolate, if she's feeling particularly adventurous.
So we ordered small black coffees at four different locales and added some cream and two packets of Splenda to each. And how could we forget HUDS—we grabbed a cup of that as well. Find out how we break them down after the jump.
J.P. Licks ($1.75): The coffee started out smooth and ended with a bitter tang. The latter effect didn't impinge the tastiness of the former at all—in fact, it added to the character of the drink, if anything. The more we drank of it, the better the drink became. But we both agreed that we couldn't have too much of this one in a single sitting.
Starbucks ($1.75): As an experienced coffee drinker, L. expected Starbucks to be her least favorite of the bunch; she's always had a prejudice against Starbucks regular coffee because the chain seemed to do specialty drinks better. After drinking the coffee, L. noted that while it was bold and consistent in flavor, the taste itself was unappealing.  E. found the drink a little harsh for her taste, and thought the drink exemplified everything she was wary about concerning coffee in the first place.
Peet's ($1.81): Unlike Starbucks, Peet's didn't have that initial alarming attack on the palette. Instead, it's nicely smooth, with that signature Peet's bite in the finish. The earthy, wholesome taste is peculiarly velvety. But the only drawback may be that it seems like a rather weak coffee.
Crema Cafe ($1.70): A real winner. We loved Crema Cafe for its silky deliciousness. It had that wonderful coffee flavor without the kick that turned us off from some of the other drinks. Both Peet's and Crema had a consistent flavor without that distracting "kick," but what distinguishes the two is Crema's hearty depth. The coffee seems perfectly blended with the added cream, yielding a soft mocha color. We could both imagine drinking large quantities of Crema during a late night without getting sick of it.
HUDS (Free!): Bland, watery, unexciting. HUDS' coffee may have lacked a bitter bite, but that was only because it tastes diluted. There's a difference between having a pleasantly smooth tastes, like Crema, and having no taste at all. Unsurprising and unadventurous. But I guess that's what we get for paying nothing. Also, with HUDS, you run the risk that the coffee might be cold.
The Verdict: We decided we both enjoyed Crema Cafe's coffee the most. Lacking the harshness of Starbucks but also avoiding the blandness of HUDS, Crema Cafe struck a perfect balance between smoothness and depth. We value smooth consistency in our coffees and a subtle kick that adds without distracting from the flavor.
