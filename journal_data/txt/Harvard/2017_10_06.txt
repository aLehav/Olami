After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been about two years since Harry Styles last performed in Boston. At the time, he represented one fourth of British boy band One Direction, who packed Gillette Stadium full of frenzied fans. Since then, they’ve had a lot of growing up to do. All four of them began careers as solo artists. There have been collaborations with Bebe Rexha and Zedd and Sia. Two of them became fathers.
Gone are the days of skinny jeans and T-shirts. Harry’s style has gone through somewhat of a revamp—a dramatic haircut, a solo album, his first appearance in a movie (Christopher Nolan’s World War II summer blockbuster, “Dunkirk”). These days, he wears 70’s-inspired floral Gucci suits and plays guitar. But the fans are no less enthusiastic. Last Saturday, Styles played the sixth concert of his first solo tour at the Wang Theater, five months after the release of his self-titled debut album. It was undoubtedly a smaller venue—3,500 seats to Gillette Stadium’s 66,000—but his onstage charisma, and the fans’ energy, were enough to fill the space.
Muna, an electronic pop trio led by singer Katie Gavin, opened the show. “Everything’s about you to me,” Gavin sang in “Everything,” one of the tracks from “About U,” their debut album. Their set also featured a rousing cover of Stevie Nicks’ “Edge of Seventeen” as well as songs from their album. When it was time for Styles to come onstage, a pink curtain patterned with the flower motif dropped. A spotlight illuminated his lanky silhouette from behind. The crowd screamed—even a suggestion of him, it seemed, was enough to elicit shrieks. Backed by four bandmates (sounds familiar?), Styles began the show with “Ever Since New York,” the album’s eighth track, a guitar-heavy indie song.
In total, he played a tidy set of 14 songs (his album contains 10). He played a bluesy version of “Just a Little Bit of Your Heart,” which he helped co-write for Ariana Grande’s 2014 album “My Everything,” as well as a cover of Fleetwood Mac’s “The Chain,” which he had performed earlier this year for a BBC Live Lounge. He seemed tired at first, standing with his guitar for “Sweet Creature” and “Two Ghosts,” a stark contrast to his days of sprinting down stadium walkways. But when it was time for “Only Angel” and “Kiwi,” anthemic hard rock tracks, Styles displayed trademark cheek, sticking out his tongue and touching front row hands, even spraying a water bottle over the crowd.
While tabloids and media outlets have dramatized the boy-band’s indefinite hiatus, Styles’ incorporation of several One Direction songs into his set list worked to offset any notions of ill will among bandmates. “If you have happened to see me out with my lovely friends before, please sing along,” he said by way of preface to “Story of My Life,” a single from the band’s 2014 album “Midnight Memories.” He also performed a rock version of “What Makes You Beautiful,” the band’s first single.
Styles tends to play with standards of masculinity, and his concert was no exception. Lines for merchandise—pink sweatshirts with “Harry” stitched into the chest, white T-shirts with Styles’ signature pastel flower motif—snaked around the lobby and up the stairs. During “Woman,” bright pink lighting illuminated his silhouette from the back. Bucking some of rock’s hyper-masculine stereotypes, Styles is a well-known supporter of feminism and BGLTQ rights; at one point in the night, he ran around the stage with a rainbow pride flag. The spirit was one of general inclusivity. “Your job,” he said, addressing the audience, “is to do whatever makes you happiest in the world. Do whatever you want. Be whoever you want to be.”
Unsurprisingly, the audience tended toward a teenage girl demographic—in total, there were maybe 20 men in the audience (one of whom was my father, whom Styles called out for wearing “a very nice jumper”). The estrogen dominance was likely the result of rapid online ticket sales by fervent teenage fans, a serious barrier to entry for newcomers to the Styles camp. One glance around the theater revealed T-shirts, handwritten signs, screaming fans who had congregated in droves, all vying for a glimpse of their golden boy. To borrow some lyrics from his opening band, everything is about him to them.

When we are looking death in the face, we will not take up our musical instruments. But, when death seems far from us, what will remind us, prepare us, for the work needs to be done when death comes?
Why has music endured? Certainly, humanity’s enjoyment of music is clear. But amidst rising social, political, and natural conflict, the significance and influence of music seems small. What does it really do in our broken world? In my contemporary ensemble seminar, Professor Claire Chase began class by asking about our thoughts and feelings towards current events concerning the NFL, Donald Trump, and the state of our nation’s race relations. Honestly, my reflections made me discouraged, as practicing musical performance seemed to be an inconsequential response compared to activities like attending protests or calling my state representative. However, I could not let go of music entirely. Does music’s capacity to resonate deep within us truly yield negligible results in the greater narrative of life?  I remember composer Jason Eckardt noting that if music was truly unnecessary for humanity to survive and flourish, then it makes no sense that music has not been evolutionarily phased out of our species millennia ago. Somehow, along the way of life, we must have forgotten the role music plays in constructing our world.
In modern society, it is easy to forget that music has the capacity to draw us towards something. Long before the first concert halls, music was played in the church’s liturgy. Even before then, the ancient Greeks placed flautists at the front of their armies as they moved into battle. The Iban people in Malaysia performed song and dance in ceremonies for healing the sick and diseased. Music functioned in these contexts not as a direct contributor to whatever liturgy, attack, or healing was being performed, but it fed back into its participants, stirring sentiment and zeal towards the performance, giving energy and desire to continue those practices for generations.
This sense of being directed by music is present in the daily, mundane parts of our lives as well. Whether we are studying, commuting, working out, dining at a restaurant, or hanging at a party, music is present. It subconsciously strikes our souls into resonance with behaviors of focus, peace, exertion, or conversation. These latter examples illustrate how music speaks to both the existential and the mundane parts of our soul. Even more so, it is a powerful way in which both sides of living coincide into an integral, singular experience.
From 1975 to 1979, the Cambodian genocide, with a death toll of an estimated 1.5 million to 3 million, wiped out ninety percent of all practitioners of traditional Cambodian music. In 2015, I heard a Cambodian genocide survivor and musician speak of how he had forsaken music, an integral part of his identity and vocation, in order to survive day by day. Now in the United States, he devotes his time towards the documentation and passing on of this oral tradition. Indeed, when we are looking death in the face, we will not take up our instruments, but move toward survival. But conversely, when death seems far, what will remind us of the brokenness and chaos that is ever present in this world? Some members of the Cambodian music community might wonder if their musical culture will ever not be about the genocide, as such an event brought the tradition so close to extinction. Perhaps in some ways it may not be, but undoubtedly the scars and aftermath of that tragic time will always resonate in the history and identity of the Cambodian people.
This music, a ritual practice of traditional Cambodian lifestyle, is both a meditation on the everyday and the existential. Nor is this unique to Cambodian music. Hip hop, church hymns, patriotic songs, each of these musics carry histories, hopes, joys and sorrows. The ear may tune itself to hear any, all, or none of it. The utility of music as a tool for change is a bit of a false question. It is not something we choose to incorporate into life or not. It is a facet of life itself. Will music calm unrest or conflict? Not quite, because it speaks of unrest and conflict themselves, as well as of joy and celebration. It is our choice, however, whether to hear that resonance or not. In this sense, music is all too powerful in world building, in solidarity, and in empathy. Music is the resonance of our world. Just as we may seek to open our eyes to the joys and sorrows around us, we may open our ears as well.

Season Three of “Rick and Morty” has been marked by change in a way the series has never seen before. From its first episode, the series has taken a significantly darker, more emotional, more violent turn. One could argue that from a narrative perspective, this was the best season yet. Others, however, have found themselves perplexed by the shift from Dan Harmon’s wacky, sci-fi, nihilistic take on a “Family Guy”-styled sitcom to an emotionally honest depiction of a family undergoing serious turmoil.
In a lot of ways, the third season brings home to roost all the emotional baggage of the main cast. Rick’s selfishness and constant lashing out at his family’s vulnerabilities forces them to react. Morty decides he’s had enough of Rick’s abuse and begins to consistently challenge Rick’s authority—no longer so easily cowed as he was in previous seasons. Summer starts to act out, attempting to find her role in a family that was dysfunctional long before Rick destabilized them. Beth starts to push away from her father’s vice-like grip on her happiness. Jerry uses the time away the divorce gives him to reflect on his own role in their unhappy marriage.
Thus, it is particularly striking that the season finale functions as something of a reset button for the Sanchez-Smith family in a season which has been explicitly about change. In the backdrop of Rick’s feud with the President of the United States—which is couched in the language of a breakup and satirized by all-out guerilla war between the two—Beth decides to remarry Jerry and reunite the family. Rick, who manipulated Beth into divorcing Jerry at the beginning of the season, is furious. When he goes to exact revenge, however, he finds that Morty, in another first for the series, has stolen his portal gun and left their adventure early. The show ends with the family sitting down to a meal together, just as they have in previous seasons.
But when Rick insults Jerry, as he normally does, Beth stands up for him. The way in which the family interacts is different now: Rick is no longer the center of the family’s universe. The central characters of “Rick and Morty” have undergone the most intensive character growth the series has seen, over the course of the darkest, most emotionally complex season so far. Rick, though complex in his own right, has remained obstinately static, and so the rest of the family have outgrown him.
This is how the season finale, though seemingly a reset, renders the cast of “Rick and Morty” as fundamentally different than they were in seasons prior. Throughout the series, Rick has been a god unto his own, able to shape the lives of any person through sheer intellect and ruthless manipulation. Lost in his own depression, still bleeding from the wounds of the past, Rick has pushed his own emotional inadequacies and fears onto the family since the beginning of the series.
The finale is the culmination of people learning to fight back over the course of the season. Each character comes to understand the triggers Rick uses to control them, and grows into a person who no longer responds to those triggers. Beth overcomes her abandonment issues, Jerry accepts his narcissism, Summer learns to live without depending on Rick’s approval, and Morty learns to stand up to the only person who’s ever made him feel special. The writers have certainly built up the series’ mainstays into much more complex characters than they started with. The only question left is whether or not they’ll do them justice in the seasons to come.

The release of the 20-verse “longlist” of potential final lines for the lyrics of “Fair Harvard” has brought with it unique and exciting ways students can help change one of our school’s historic traditions. Whatever we may think about the substance of the change, it is good that students can help guide a change that will impact the next generation of Harvard affiliates.
Upon the revision of the title of “House Master” last year, we stated, “Our world evolves, Harvard evolves, and we evolve with it.” Evolution is a constant theme in this whole matter; Danielle S. Allen, Government professor and co-chair of the Presidential Task Force in charge of the contest, has called the alma mater the “anchor ritual” of Harvard, and part of its “DNA.” If we are to grant this matter the same level of significance as Allen does, then it is only fair that Harvard let the general University community decide what the spirit of Harvard should be.
Our position remains the same: While we originally did not find the proposed changes to our alma mater a substantive change, we did express hope that the contest would re-engage students with tradition and encourage students to reflect on Harvard's past and roots, especially as they relate to the present. And it appears the campaign has embraced this goal. The current voting system, contrary to being a trivial popularity contest, offers the Harvard community the chance to have their voice be heard.
Moreover, the Solution Space that the Task Force has created has been instrumental in creating a forum for open discussion about all issues Harvard, including the topic of the alma mater. We encourage all Harvard students and affiliates to allow their thoughts to be heard by submitting to the Solution Space.
The 20 verses that comprise the longlist are mostly fine choices and worthy to replace the final line of the alma mater’s. Some, like “Veritas be Thy Destiny’s guide,” seem particularly suitable and succinct. We hope the final choice will carry our school’s motto, as it is empowering to students, situates Harvard’s lessons in the world, and places an emphasis on the pursuit of truth. But regardless of the line the administration chooses to cap the refrain, we shall be glad to have had the chance to help play a part in this decision, and we hope our fellow students will be, too.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the beginning of summer, Harvard has been a war zone of free speech and political correctness culture. At least 10 students had their university acceptance rescinded for posting off-color memes, a faculty committee recommended doing away with final clubs, The Crimson had a free speech battle involving a range of opinions, and protesters called for the Charles Murray event to be cancelled. With all that has happened, we still haven’t settled the issue of free speech and expression.
I think we need to step back and remember a childish retort that’s strangely applicable to 2017: “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” We all have heard this at least once in our life to serve as a reminder to pay no heed to someone’s unpleasant remark about you. Because really, words can’t physically harm you, right? Or can they?
Lisa Feldman Barrett, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University, argues that words can hurt you, in a sense. They can make you feel sick and stressed, even shortening your life. To maintain “a culture of constant, casual brutality is toxic to the body.” This is the reason given for why we must inhibit speech that “bullies and torments.” Barrett further argues that “it’s reasonable, scientifically speaking, to not allow a provocateur and hatemonger like Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at your school. He is part of something noxious, a campaign of abuse.”
But how can Yiannopoulos contribute to “a campaign of abuse” when his speech doesn’t bear the same impact for each person? Some people may say that his speech harms them (although I believe they meant to say disturbed, not harmed), but his words, with which I don’t agree, don’t trouble me.
Admittedly, while sometimes browsing the weird part of the internet, I have read a few articles on traumatic subjects that made me felt sick to my stomach, but I’m not so psychologically scarred to see a need to ban such material. What is absolutely disgusting to me may not be to another. It is, after all, subjective.
Should there be no limit to free speech then? There is a small list of types of speech not covered by the First Amendment, one of which is harassment. In 1999, Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education declared that for something to be considered as harassment, it has to be “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victims are effectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and opportunities.” So, if speech falls under that legal language of harassment, then it becomes unprotected speech.
Outside of harassment though, there are words and phrases that are protected but still offend people. Keep in mind that offensiveness doesn’t equate to bullying, violence, or some other variation, and when someone say something offensive, you don’t have to smile and accept it—just tell the person directly.
It was just last week that an acquaintance of mine told me that he took four classes this past summer. To that I sarcastically said that I would rather jump off a bridge. Someone else overheard and asked that I not say that, since he has known people who really did so. I apologized to him and realized that that innocuous phrase might be hurtful to people who know a victim of suicide. I was in no way intentionally bullying or tormenting him or trying to make a joke about suicide or mental illness, but this phrase offended him when it might not bother someone else.
So, if someone were to use “retarded” and it offended you, then tell them directly that their words hurt you and politely ask them to refrain from using it. That is more civil and builds a friendlier relationship than going through a third party—like your helicopter mom or administrators—to impose a campaign on everyone to not use the word. We are human and all of us will at some point unintentionally say something that is subjectively offensive. We can all learn to be civil by dealing with people directly instead of appealing to an authority.
By the same token, we need to build resilience to people’s thoughts, opinions, and even jokes because the world after graduation is much uglier than what we experience on campus. If we can’t entertain differing opinions (including ones like Murray’s that are deemed dangerous), can’t handle humor, and can’t even learn to stop caring about what others think of us, then the real world will be a rude awakening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’ve ever played the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64, you know the hardest part of the game is fighting Shadow Link. Allow me to set the scene: In this classic fantasy adventure video game, you play as Link, the Hero of Time, who saves Princess Zelda from evil Lord Ganondorf. You have to solve absurdly intricate puzzles and fight endless creepy foes—the worst of which is Shadow Link, your dark evil-twin-mini-boss lurking in the dreaded Water Temple. Shadow Link is nearly impossible to defeat because he fights exactly like you do. He parries every sword strike, mercilessly slices every exposed sliver of digitized flesh, and laughs that maddening electronic cackle every time you die. (The “Game Over” jingle still gives me nightmares.) Shadow Link is the hardest enemy of the game because no one knows how to fight himself.
No one, that is, except Harvard. In her recent op-ed, University President Drew G. Faust denounced the “shadow social environment” created by the College’s “discriminatory and exclusionary organizations” such as final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. The Crimson Editorial Board recently joined Faust in this stand against exclusivity, arguing that such groups perpetrate “outdated notions of elitism, classism, and exclusivity on campus.” These arguments, gleaming in the heroic rhetoric of inclusivity, try to pit Harvard the Hero of Time against his evil enemy, Shadow Social Environment. But no matter how loudly we claim to stand against exclusivity, the truth is that Harvard’s undergraduate culture is still pervaded by it. The administration’s social group-banning sword strikes and community-promoting spin moves are bound to fail—because the exclusive shadow Harvard is fighting against is really itself.
Exclusivity saturates student social life, and for better or worse, it permeates far beyond unrecognized single-gender social organizations. Take the notorious Harvard “comp.” To participate in nearly any extracurricular organization, students must first jostle through a series of admission requirements termed the “comp”—originally for “competence,” but more realistically for “competition.” From auditions and call-backs to interviews and writing quotas, Harvard undergraduates must win their spot in the social sphere by excluding someone else from doing the same. After competing for admission, Harvard students must compete for community. By no means are these groups the only way to find friends or pursue interests on campus, but the opportunity to develop skills, practice leadership, and win prestige certainly makes them the most desirable way of doing so.
So as Faust tackles USGSOs to defend “the ideals of inclusion against the incursions of discrimination and exclusion in student life,” and as The Crimson Editorial Board urges Harvard to “ensure that student organizations do not further perpetuate exclusivity,” the comp’s fight for membership continues to weed out willing participants with the very “rules and processes of discrimination and exclusion” that Faust claims to condemn in her op-ed.
This pervasive exclusivity doesn’t stop with comps. From political groups and religious clubs, to all-black commencement celebrations and Fuerza Latina, Harvard is dominated, as Faust puts it, “by organizations that divide students into groups of like-minded individuals.” This isn’t to say “comping” or homogenized student groups are good or bad—it’s to say that Harvard can’t fight exclusivity in USGSOs while pretending exclusion doesn’t saturate other major areas of student life. For good or for evil, exclusivity orders the College’s social scene. Harvard’s Journey toward Inclusion seems like it’s doomed for an endless repeat of “Game Over.”
But is it really surprising that a school with one of the lowest historical acceptance rates, with a meme page (explicitly if ironically intended) for Elitist 1% Tweens, has an exclusive social environment?
The far more interesting question is whether or not it should.
In preaching that total inclusion is necessary to build “the Harvard community,” the administration forgets that exclusion, to some degree, is necessary for any community at all. A group self-identifies as much by who is not a member as who is, and the most rewarding, supportive community often comes from “groups of like-minded individuals” who share passions, beliefs, and interests. How did the Harvard community form in the first place? By rejecting 95 percent of the people who wanted to join it. How does the College build house camaraderie on Thursday “community nights”? By excluding anyone who’s not a house resident from eating in a given dining hall. Some degree of exclusion is necessary for community. Eliminating all exclusivity in the name of community is like throwing Princess Zelda out the tower window to save her from Ganondorf.
Given our campus culture, it’s unrealistic to think we’ll achieve unblemished inclusivity, and given the nature of community, it’d be undesirable to do so in the first place. But assuming all exclusivity is good is just as mistaken as assuming all exclusivity is bad. The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, may rightly reject applicants who don’t have the right sense of humor, but Harvard admissions can’t fairly reject applicants on the same grounds. The standard—based on jokes or grades—should meritocratically fit the purpose of the community doing the excluding, with equal opportunity for willing applicants to participate and, if excluded, to find or form another community. (Whether it’s the College’s place to winnow out the bad exclusivity from the good is another matter.)
After hours of hand cramps and maddening “Game Over” jingles, the Hero of Time finally defeats Shadow Link—in my case at least—by spamming him with a new magic spell. The College needs a similarly new strategy to end its fight with Shadow Social Environment. Until Harvard’s students, for better or for worse, take up arms against the culture of exclusion, the College, by standing against exclusivity, will remain deadlocked in a fight against itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
At Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, I proposed a new motion. The Crimson and other campus publications have misreported that motion. The full text and supporting materials are available here.
Most importantly, my motion does not adjust the categories of recognition and non-recognition.
The confusion has crept in because the unrecognized single-gender social organization committee included, as an appendix to its report, an earlier effort at an alternative motion that I developed in January 2017 but never formally presented. I provided that document to the committee over the summer to contribute to their study materials. When I visited with the committee in September of 2017, I launched my remarks by informing them that I was no longer pursuing the strategy of that earlier memo. In other words, Appendix A of the USGSO committee report is irrelevant in relation to the motions currently on the table. The USGSO committee has not of yet offered an opinion on the motion that I placed on the table this week.
The so-called “Allen motion” currently on the table is very simple and, I believe, represents a middle way between the two poles of the argument. It adopts the categories for student organizations to be found in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’s 1989 anti-hazing statute, and argues that students participating in all those organizations should be subject to the rules in the College Handbook for participation in student organizations.
Its effect would be that students who join student social groups that have become co-educational and that otherwise adhere to campus policies for student organizations will not face repercussions from the administration. Students who join social groups that have not become co-educational will be ineligible to continue enrollment at the College.
I invite those with questions about it to feel free to be in touch with me directly at allen@ethics.harvard.edu.

In response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, Cambridge City Council voted Monday to adopt four new “sister cities” in Puerto Rico.
The unanimously-passed resolution will designate Coamo, Orocovis, Salinas, and Jayuya— four Puerto Rican cities well-represented in Cambridge’s population—as sister cities. Its goal is “to strategically increase opportunities and pathways for collaboration and aid to these municipalities that have such deep ties to our city,” according to the resolution.
“It’s important for Cambridge to do its part,” City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said in an interview Thursday. The resolution mentions inviting representatives from each of these cities to Cambridge, and comes days after a group of Harvard students launched fundraising efforts to aid Puerto Rico.
“I think it demonstrates how Cambridge is a leader and how Cambridge supports its residents,” added Former Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan, who co-authored the resolution. Benzan said he also hopes that “other cities around the state will do the same,” in an effort to provide much-needed aid to the island.
Although the resolution does not make specific commitments of monetary aid, it streamlines potential future aid by focusing it to specific cities, Benzan said.
Mazen said, however, that sister-city designation alone is not enough for Cambridge to effect change in Puerto Rico, adding that “financial support” to the affected areas will be needed as well. Rafael G. Escalera Montoto ’19, who has family in Puerto Rico, added that even with donations, distribution remains a challenge.
“There are cities which are further off from that capital and are kind of hard to get into. Trees are knocked down; roads are destroyed. Access has been very difficult,” he said. Benzan also noted the difficulty of distributing aid supplies to municipalities outside of the capital, especially in mountainous regions.
According to the Department of Defense, 95 percent of Puerto Rico’s residents remain without power, and 88 percent are still without cell service. Critical infrastructure like roads and hospitals also remain in poor condition.
Escalera Montoto noted the importance in maintaining public awareness throughout Puerto Rico’s recovery period.
“A big part of the help would be keeping up awareness because it’s already being said in the media at home in Puerto Rico that the recovery is going to take months, and there’s no time clear as to when the island will be recovered—if it will be recovered—to the capacity it was before,” he said.
Cambridge already has six active sister city partnerships, with Coimbra, Portugal; Gaeta, Italy; Tsukuba, Japan; San José Las Flores, El Salvador; Yerevan, Armenia; and Galway, Ireland, along with eleven inactive relationships.

Harvard has quietly adjusted its calendar to recognize the second Monday in October as both Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples’ Day, reflecting a move by the City of Cambridge to rename the holiday last year.
Still, some Native American students say they want the University to formally renounce Columbus Day, arguing that the Italian explorer should not be celebrated.
Last June, the Cambridge City Council unanimously agreed to change the name of the holiday to Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Nadeem A. Mazen, the Cambridge city councillor who proposed the city’s renaming of the holiday, said the move was intended to reclaim the day for Native Americans killed after Columbus’s landing in the Americas.
“At a basic level, we’re saying ‘no’ to a day named after someone who was a tyrant, and was a torturer, and was a destroyer of Indigenous people, to turn this around and to honor those people without saying anything bad about other people,” Mazen said.
Ashley N. Hamilton ’20, a member of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska and vice president of Native Americans at Harvard College, echoed Mazen. “It’s a celebration of our survival in that we’re still here, thriving, even though it’s not really known,” she said of the renamed holiday.
Hamilton said she would like the University to put out an official statement recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day. “We were not talked to,” she said.
A Harvard spokesperson wrote in an email that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences updated the wording on its calendar to include both holidays in accordance with federal and Cambridge parameters and declined to comment further.
Native Americans at Harvard College has advocated for official recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ Day by the University for years, according to Truman M. Burrage ’19, the club’s president and a member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.
Burrage said the group sent a letter and signed petition to University President Drew G. Faust and a number of other administrators last year, along with a petition. The Undergraduate Council endorsed the petition last year.
The group will hold an event in the Yard Monday to celebrate indigenous culture and demonstrate against the name Columbus Day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the day before the worst shooting in modern American history, the mother and sister of Freddie Shanel ’21 had gone to the Las Vegas Strip to attend a show for her sister’s birthday.
The following night, Stephen Paddock rained bullets on a crowd attending a concert on the Strip from the 32nd floor of a high-rise hotel, killing 59 people and injuring over 500. Shanel, a Las Vegas native, woke up to escalating alerts on her phone announcing the news.
“I think there’s kind of a second when you catch your breath,” she said. Her mother and sister soon sent a note to her family members notifying them that they were safe, giving Shanel a quick moment of relief.
But the moment soon passed, Shanel said. “Over time, it starts to settle in, how horrible it was, what happened.”
For students from Las Vegas, Sunday’s shooting sparked feelings of panic, helplessness, and eventually deep sadness.
“There’s a difference when you see these stories on the news and then it’s your home, twenty minutes away from where you live. I can’t tell you how many times my sister and my friends have been to that venue for concerts,” Logan T. Houck ’19 said.
Houck said his sister’s friend was injured at the concert venue, and one of his brother’s friends lost a parent in the shooting.
“The main feeling I’ve felt is just complete helplessness being so far away,” Houck said. “It’s just incredible how intimate the relationships are. It seems like every single person in Vegas you know is somehow affected.”
In the wake of the massacre, a Las Vegas Victims’ Fund to aid those affected has so far raised over $9 million. On campus, too, Nevadan students have started initiatives to provide financial support back home.
Jack C. Heavey ’18, a Nevadan who has worked at the Eliot Grille for the past three years, proposed for Grille to donate all the proceeds it made Monday night to the Las Vegas Victims’ Fund.
“It was the platform that I could do something with, and I was already planning to work that night, and so in that way it worked out,” he said.
In all, the Eliot Grille donated $333 to victim relief, Heavey said.
“In terms of weeknight revenue, that was the highest that I’ve ever seen the Grille had. [It was] one of the largest nights ever,” Heavey said.
Houck also felt spurred to act, reaching out to the Boston Blood Bank and the American Red Cross to plan a blood drive this weekend.
Beyond sending help to Las Vegas, students said it was also important to support each other on campus.
“Everyone’s been extremely supportive and has been checking in with me,” Heavey said. “It’s moments like these when we really do come together to help out that really do make [Harvard] seem like a home away from home.”
Shanel agreed. “You can’t bring 59 people back, but the least thing you can do is support those who are going through it and support those who need help,” she said.

Filmmaker Ava DuVernay, actor and rapper LL Cool J, and six others received the W.E.B. Du Bois Medal—Harvard’s highest honor in the field of African and African American Studies—before a zealous crowd in Sanders Theatre Wednesday afternoon.
Harvard has presented the medals annually since 2000 to individuals “in recognition of their contributions to African American culture and the life of the mind,” according to the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research’s website.
In addition to DuVernay and LL Cool J, this year’s recipients included Democratic political strategist Donna Brazile, Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, Microsoft Board Chair John Thompson, Ford Foundation President Darren Walker, visual artist Kara Walker, and philanthropist Jennifer Ward Oppenheimer ’89, who was honored posthumously.
After receiving the medal, LL Cool J read a post from his Instagram account that honored victims of Sunday’s shooting in Las Vegas, which killed 59 people and wounded hundreds more. He encouraged audience members to remain resilient in the face of tragedy.
“Our intestinal fortitude is being tried. But, world, we have been here before,” LL Cool J said. “This experiment called humanity can and will work if we stay grounded in faith, tempered by reason and bolstered by action. We must resist the temptation to live in fear.”
The rapper ended his acceptance speech on a hopeful note, and said he was “giving the whole world a hug.”
“Stay strong. Fear not. Stay faith filled. Better days are coming,” he added.
DuVernay, the first black female director to be nominated for a Golden Globe, said she was humbled to receive the award given her modest upbringing.
“I’m experiencing a feeling today, a feeling of joy...it’s a unique kind of joy that you experience when you find yourself somewhere entirely unexpected,” she said. “There was no way that I ever envisioned that would have me standing here at Harvard, a girl from Compton who never went to film school.”
Others accepted the Du Bois medal with lighthearted remarks.
“It’s a real medal,” Kara Walker, the evening’s first honoree, joked, to chuckles from the audience. “Thank you very much—it’s a true honor.”
University President Drew G. Faust, Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton, and Hutchins Center Director Henry Louis Gates, Jr. presented the awards on Wednesday.

In an attempt to streamline the process of sifting through on-campus activities, a freshman has created a website with the goal of displaying events in one user-friendly platform.
George H. Moe ’21 created ClubHub three years ago to organize events at his high school. Moe said that he started the site after he “missed an event [he] really wanted to go to because the email got buried.”
The large number of campus email listservs, posters, and Facebook events spurred Moe to adapt ClubHub for Harvard’s campus.
“If high school was confusing in terms of events, Harvard is even more so. There’s just so much going on, and there’s so much more to explore,” Moe said.
ClubHub’s features include an ability to filter events by keyword, browse through all the activities happening on a given day, and instantly add events to Google Calendar. Moe is also currently working on a system to compile event reminders in a daily digest in order to maximize user-friendliness.
“It’s smooth, it’s buttery, it’s very colorful,” he said. “It’s also aggregating information into a database that’s very useful.”
Genty Daku ’20 said that while a single platform for events would be useful, he currently uses Facebook as a medium to search for on-campus events.
“It would be useful if you [were] able to see where your friends are going because that influences whether or not I go to an event,” Daku said.
Eva Xu ’18 said that the website’s smooth features solve a problem she had during her first few months at college.
“When I came here as a freshman, it took me a while to discover all the activities around here. There are some interesting things that pop up that don’t get noticed,” Xu said. “Right now I am getting better at keeping track of what interests me, but still, it can be a little messy.”

The number of students taking Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” on a “Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory” standard this fall increased more than three fold after the course changed its policy to make the non-letter grading scheme the default.
The new policy was one of many sweeping changes made to the class this year after more than 60 students appeared before the College’s Honor Council in 2016.
For the first time, students must opt-out of the satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading system and petition for a letter grade. According to CS50 head instructor David J. Malan ’99, the percentage of students taking the course sat/unsat increased from 7 percent last year to 28 percent this year.
The Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading system allows students to earn either a grade of “Satisfactory,” for letter grades from A to C-, or a grade of “Unsatisfactory,” which is considered a failing grade.
According to Malan, the change is intended to take grade pressure off of students and encourage them to push past their comfort zone.
Malan, who took the class pass/fail as an undergraduate in 1996, told The Crimson last month that, “Were it not for Pass/Fail… I myself probably wouldn’t have taken CS50 as a sophomore, let alone concentrated in CS ultimately.”
Students echoed Malan’s sentiment, saying that it had encouraged them to take risks with the class.
“They want you to get as much out of the course but not stress about your grade per se,” said
Julia L. Henry ’20 said she is currently taking the course for a letter grade due to concentration requirements.
Cameron E. Reaves ’21, another student in the course who is taking it Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, said it had made him “a lot more relaxed about CS50.”
“I’m just going to try and learn,” he added. “I think it’s a good thing.”
Sara M. Kvaska ’21 said the new system is “good for a lot of people because it takes the stress off them to feel like they need to only take it for a grade.”
Some students reported uncertainty about whether a “Satisfactory” grade in CS50 would count for Computer Science concentration credit.
Kvaska, who said she petitioned for a letter grade, said, “I had to because I want to major [in Computer Science].”
The Computer Science Department website recommends that prospective concentrators take CS50 for a letter grade, but notes that departmental credit is also available for “Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory” students.
Malan released statistics on “CS50’s changing demographics” in a Medium post Thursday.
According to that post, total enrollment in CS50 is 691 students this year.There was also a 4 percentage point increase—from 62 percent to 66 percent—of students considering themselves “less comfortable” with computer science.

The Honor Council is increasing the number of trainings it conducts with Harvard teaching fellows, Council Secretary Brett Flehinger announced at a public town hall meeting Thursday evening.
The Council—a two-year-old body composed of students, administrators, and faculty that adjudicates academic dishonesty cases at the College—previously held trainings only for “small numbers” of teaching fellows, often grouped by class, according to Flehinger. Now, though, the body is initiating department-wide trainings for teaching fellows across different academic disciplines.
“We’ve done Sociology, we’ve done the History department,” Flehinger said. “And we have at least a half dozen [other trainings] scheduled.”
At these sessions, Council representatives outline how the body operates and what its policies mean in practice, Flehinger said. Members also instruct teaching fellows how to handle different scenarios—for example, Flehinger recalled explaining to staffers how to deal with a student who commits plagiarism.
The added trainings come on the heels of a broader outreach effort intended to grow the Council’s influence on campus: over the past two months, the body has begun meeting with athletic teams and making more presentations to undergraduate classes. The Council on Monday released its second-ever annual report revealing the number of “inappropriate collaboration” cases at the College had doubled since the last academic year.
At the town hall Tuesday night, held in William James Hall, three Council members—Flehinger, Jack W. Jue ’18, and Margery W. Tong ’17—discussed the specifics of the report before taking questions from attendees. Roughly 30 students and faculty members came to the event.
In remarks lasting for about 20 minutes, the three described what they saw as two key takeaways from the report: first, the number of undergraduates cheating on exams increased slightly from 2015-2016, a rise Jue attributed “in large part” to students inappropriately using phones during tests. The second major conclusion involved the spike in inappropriate collaboration cases.
That jump comes the same year a cheating scandal in Harvard’s flagship introductory computer science course roiled campus: More than 60 fall 2016 enrollees in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” faced charges of academic dishonesty. The Council obliquely referenced CS50 in its report, writing in a footnote that “one large introductory course” skewed the data—but members did not once mention the class during the town hall.
In wake of the cheating revelations, some CS50 students alleged the course’s collaboration policy for problem sets—summarized as “be reasonable”—was too vague and led some enrollees to cheat unintentionally.
During the question period, attendees grilled Council members on Harvard course collaboration policies in particular. One student said he thinks guidelines for classes in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—the category within which CS50 falls—are especially unclear,  and asked what the Council is doing to address the issue.
“One thing is when we do come across policies that would seem to be vague, we go back to the faculty and say, ‘Look, this is what we can’t figure out,’” Flehinger said in reply. “I also think it’s worth you saying that to your faculty.”
Students also brought up the increased rate of cheating on exams, and asked how the Council plans to combat cellphone-facilitated dishonesty. Some attendees suggested banning phones from exams entirely.
One undergraduate, noting that students sometime sneak into restrooms during exams to look up answers on their phones, proposed placing an administrator or course staffer in the bathroom to encourage test-takers not to cheat.
“There’s a couple reasons that’s not a great idea,” Flehinger said to laughter.

Christine M. O. Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, painted a rosy picture of the global economy—though with reservations about continued prosperity—at the Institute of Politics Thursday.
A French lawyer and politician, Lagarde worked for four years as the Fund's Minister of Finance before becoming the first female director of the IMF in 2011. The organization seeks to promote economic stability around the world.
“The long awaited global recovery is taking root,” she said, describing the organization’s official global economic outlook, scheduled for release late next week, as “even more optimistic.”
Though economic conditions are improving and more jobs are being created around the world, she indicated that the recovery was not complete.
“Some countries are growing way too slowly. We have at the moment more than 47 countries where growth is actually negative on a per-capita basis,” she said.
Lagarde also urged countries to take advantage of relatively calm economic waters to invest in economies and implement structural reforms. “Reforms are more potent and easier to implement when economies are healthier,” she said.
“We are saying that those countries that are in clear surplus or close to surplus should definitely take advantage of that,” she said. “For those economies where the debt is clearly up we believe that it’s not time to have any fiscal expansion and it’s time to at least stabilize and try to reduce the deficit.”
Joined by former University President Lawrence H. Summers on stage after her address, she fielded questions about topics including bitcoin, law firm recruiting, Universal Basic Income, current GOP tax proposals, and the gender wage gap.
“I am very interested in making sure we can quantify the gains that come from women’s empowerment… because if we can quantify it we can make it very [compelling],” Lagarde said.
Alluding to tax reform bills in Congress, Summers asked Lagarde about a “hypothetical nation” that “would raise projected budget deficits over 10 years by, just to pick some numbers that I heard somewhere, 1.5 to 2 trillion dollars?”
“Well because I don’t have enough details about that tax reform in that dystopian country of yours, I’m not going to pass judgement on that,” Lagarde replied.
Ted G. Waechter ’18, a Crimson Editorial editor, asked Lagarde about what he viewed as the IMF’s “neocolonial” practices. Lagarde disagreed, citing the IMF’s role in encouraging helpful but difficult reforms in countries.
Lagarde concluded with what she called her address’s “bottom line.”
“Policymakers should use all tools at their disposal to act now, and take advantage of the period of global growth. As I said, let us not let a good recovery go to waste,” she said

A petition urging Harvard to drop its appeal to the federal National Labor Relations Board is accumulating support from University affiliates.
The petition, posted on Solution Space—an online forum for Harvard affiliates to voice input on University initiatives—on Sept. 11, has received over 180 upvotes on the website, making it one of the platform’s most popular posts.
In the post, graduate student and unionization supporter Marena Lin ’11 argues that Harvard is undermining the democratic process in opposing a second election to determine whether Harvard students may unionize.
After preliminary results of the November 2016 unionization election showed more voters opposed the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers than supported it, the unionization effort filed an objection arguing that the NLRB should mandate a re-vote. The union effort argued the list of eligible voters that Harvard generated before the election was inadequate.
In July, NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr. ruled that the union’s objection was valid and Harvard must hold a new election.
Harvard then requested that federal NLRB review the case. If successful, the appeal could override Walsh’s ruling and prevent a second unionization election at Harvard
Lin’s post argues that Walsh’s decision was valid and should not be overruled.
“Inclusion in a complete list of eligible voters is at democracy’s very foundation,” she wrote. “Harvard administration’s appeal argues that they do not have a responsibility to provide a complete list of eligible voters for unionization elections.”
In an emailed statement, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote that Harvard’s voter list was adequate.
“The University worked diligently to identify and include all eligible voters on the voter list and encouraged all students who believed they should have been included to vote,” she wrote. “The University is eager to confirm the outcome of the election, which reflects the votes and voices of the majority of eligible voters.”
The petition also asserts that, if the federal NLRB hears Harvard’s case and rules in favor of the University, future unionization elections around the country could be compromised.
“If won with the Trump-appointed NLRB, this appeal could severely weaken the democratic process of unionization nationwide by disguising employer-led voter suppression behind systematic bureaucratic processes and errors,” it reads.
In an interview, Lin said Harvard should concede defeat in the unionization dispute.
“It's one thing to be against the union; it's another thing to interfere with the ability of students across the nation to unionize,” she said.
It remains unclear when the NLRB, which is composed of five officials appointed by the president, will decide whether to hear Harvard’s case. If the board does not grant Harvard’s request for review, Walsh’s decision will stand.

As the University and Harvard’s graduate student unionization effort wait to hear whether the federal National Labor Relations Board will hear their case, other private universities have challenged the original case that allows their students to unionize.
Yale and the University of Chicago each filed motions this year urging the NLRB to overrule a August 2016 decision that graduate students at Columbia—and private universities like it—are employees of their school, and therefore may unionize.
The August decision spurred an effort at Harvard to allow eligible graduate student researchers and teaching assistants and undergraduate teaching assistants to collectively bargain with the University. That movement has run into a series of roadblocks and its fate now lies at the hands of the NLRB in Washington, D.C.
In a footnote to its appeal, Yale asked the NLRB to review the original decision permitting unionization “if necessary”. Harvard has itself appealed regional NLRB decisions, though it has not explicitly asked the board to overturn its own precedent.
After a hearing this spring, the NLRB ruled that UChicago graduate students fall under the Columbia decision and are therefore eligible to unionize. In response to that ruling, the university filed an appeal with the NLRB, arguing that UChicago students should not be allowed to form a union because the student-faculty relationship is different than at Columbia.
UChicago’s brief begins by arguing that the board should overturn the entire Columbia ruling.
“Columbia represents an abrupt and unjustified reversal of long-standing Board precedent holding that graduate students who teach or conduct research in connection with their academic programs are not ‘employees,’” UChicago’s brief reads.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers organizer and graduate student Andrew B. Donnelly wrote that he is confident Harvard students could still unionize even if the NLRB overrules its Columbia decision.
“The question of whether we have the right to collective bargaining if we vote for it has been settled here at Harvard,” he wrote in an emailed statement.
If the federal NLRB hears Harvard’s appeal, it could rule that there should not be a second unionization election. If it declines to hear the case, the most recent NLRB decision—which ruled that Harvard should hold a second election—will stand.

Carved out of a hill high in Ithaca, N.Y., Schoellkopf Field is a foreboding structure.
An enormous crescent of bleachers rings one side of the Cornell stadium. Trees loom over one end zone. The place feels like the plateau of a giant mountain—windy and open.
The Big Red football program (0-3, 0-1 Ivy) is much less intimidating. Cornell hasn’t won at home since week two of 2016. The Big Red has dropped nine of its last 10 games, including three blowouts to start the 2017 season.
Saturday’s matchup with Harvard offers a chance to reverse course. In three games, Cornell has committed a staggering 10 turnovers. These miscues have boosted opponents and made competitive games feel more like routs.
Yes, the Big Red is a better team than the winless record indicates. Cornell has gained more first downs (67) than its opponents (60). The Big Red has accumulated 825 passing yards and only yielded 444.
Moreover, the three defeats have come against capable opponents. In conference play, Cornell has played only Yale—an offensive juggernaut that averages over 40 points a game.
Crimson coach Tim Murphy likes to emphasize the parity of the Ivy League. No team is a pushover, and, given recent dominance, Harvard tends to absorb the best shot from each conference foe.
Cornell marks the ultimate test of this philosophy. Harvard has won 11 straight against the beleaguered program from Upstate New York. On Saturday, the Crimson will have a chance to claim a 12th.
“Going into enemy territory can be difficult,” said junior defensive tackle Richie Ryan. “They’re going to be pumped up. But I know my team is going to bring the juice.”
The Harvard defense has certainly brought the juice in recent weeks. Last Saturday, the Crimson shut out the Georgetown offense. The Saturday before, Harvard pulled the same trick for three quarters versus Brown.
The front seven has played a major role. The Hoyas netted a pathetic 46 rushing yards on 30 attempts. Already, junior defensive end D.J. Bailey has recorded four sacks and a forced fumble.
As capably as the defensive line has played, the secondary may have performed even better. Senior defensive backs have tallied pick-sixes in consecutive games—one by safety Tanner Lee and one by cornerback Raishaun McGhee.
The Crimson has a reasonable chance of furthering the streak against quarterback Dalton Banks. The Big Red junior has tossed nine interceptions versus three touchdowns.
This ugly stat line conceals major talent. At 6’3” and 237 pounds, Banks outweighs all of Harvard’s linebackers. Last season, the then-sophomore earned an All-Ivy honorable mention.
“Last year, we saw him bounce off guys that were trying to tackle him and just sling the ball,” Murphy said. “This is the ultimate trap game for us.”
Besides the many interceptions, Banks has posted solid numbers in 2017—over 250 yards per game and a completion rate of 58 percent. A sluggish ground game has hurt Cornell, though. The Big Red has totaled a paltry 219 rushing yards compared to 718 for opponents.
Like Banks, junior running back Chris Walker stands out physically but holds spotty statistics. Last year, he landed on the All-Ivy first team—a major accomplishment for a sophomore. But in 2017, he’s averaging 2.9 yards per carry.
Crimson junior Charlie Booker III has had more success. The runner has rumbled 7.2 yards per go, good for ninth in the nation. He scored two touchdowns against Georgetown.
The great mystery for Harvard exists at the quarterback position, where fifth-year senior Joe Viviano and Jake Smith are battling for the job.
Viviano, the first-game starter, has completed 60 percent of his passes for 408 yards. However, he flamed out in the second half of 2016, throwing eight interceptions over the last five games.
Smith comes with none of this baggage. Inexperience is his fatal flaw instead. He tossed two picks last week, both on ill-advised throws. At his best, Smith makes quick decisions and demonstrates impressive evasiveness. At his worst, he looks like a true freshman.
After three games, Murphy has yet to name a starter. That announcement seems likely to come in the next week or two.
“My mindset is that it’s a fluid situation,” the coach said. “I’m making no guarantees.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a week where the fall weather finally began to filter its way toward Cambridge, sun, sand, and sweat befell Harvard women’s tennis team. For the first time since Spencer Liang, Amanda Lin, Monica Lin, and June Lee competed in the doubles pre-qualifying round of the Riviera/ITA Women's All American Championship in 2013, two members of the squad qualified for the event in Palisades, Calif.
With junior Erica Oosterhout competing in pre-qualifying singles and sophomore Natasha Gonzalez partnering with Oosterhout in qualifying doubles, the Crimson was set for a full slate of matches. Entering the national tournament undefeated so far this fall with a collective record of 6-0 in singles and 3-0 in doubles, Oosterhout and Gonzalez looked to continue their winning ways.
Playing in the pre-qualifying singles event for the first time of her career, Oosterhout made quite an entrance. Riding her early-season streak, the Tampa, Fla. native began her campaign by besting sixth-ranked Anna Vrbenska of Ole Miss in three sets. After falling into an 0-1 hole to start the match, Oosterhout kicked it into high gear, ultimately pulling away to claim victory in decisive fashion—5-7, 6-2, 6-4.
The junior did not stop there, as she eventually navigated her the semifinal. It was at that stage of the event that North Carolina freshman Alexandra Sanford finally stopped Oosterhout’s progress. The routine 6-1, 6-3 loss to the Tar Heel rookie brought the junior back down to earth. She swept her previous opponent, Kansas senior Despoina Vogasari, in straight sets after her victory over Vrbenska en route to the semis.
In qualifying doubles, Oosterhout and Gonzalez competed their way to the quarterfinals of the consolation bracket. Facing off against the Florida Atlantic pair of sophomore Aliona Bolsova and freshman Natalia Boltinskaya in the opening round, Oosterhout and Gonzalez fell short. The 8-5 loss to the Owls sent the Harvard duo to the consolation bracket. Bolsova and Boltinskaya, however, eventually advanced to the penultimate round of the qualifying tournament, where they fell to Virginia’s Rosie Johanson and Meghan Kelly, 8-2.
After claiming victory by injury forfeit in their next match, Oosterhout and Gonzalez subsequently fell to senior Gabby Smith and junior Rianna Valdes of USC in a tiebreaker, 8-7.  The loss ousted the Harvard squad from the tournament, concluding its time on the Gold Coast.
