After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I felt like I was running on autopilot for the majority of my freshman year. I look back at pictures and try to remember what I spent all my time doing. I slept very little. I didn’t leave room for doubt as I went from class to meeting to lab to event to rally. I tried to balance my life in STEM while feeling an obligation to get involved in Act on a Dream, Fuerza Latina, and The Crimson. I didn’t have enough time to even consider that the place I was in was not working for me.
I give advice to first-years now that I wish I had been able to give to myself two years ago. I see them getting overworked and remember myself in their same spots when I felt empty as I spread myself so thin I didn’t have enough time for myself. Harvard promotes this culture as students get involved in multiple things and the pressure often falls on multiply-disadvantaged students as we feel responsible to take on all of the issues.
It took a huge reality hit as I realized I was not going to have the same financial security my sophomore year that I had my first year with the start-up grant of $2,000. I panicked at the thought of having to get a job and knew something was going to have to give. I felt immense guilt as I prepared to drop one of my board positions only to be surprised at how easy it was. The organization went on without me. The hit wasn’t as large for the organization as it would have been for me had I stayed.
It was with that first drop that I began learning how to manage my time. I learned how important it was to quit things that weren’t sustainable. Being passionate about organizations I was involved in was not enough. You can’t live your life in the service of others unless you learn to serve yourself first.
I felt guilty and selfish for shifting my focus to myself, but doing so has been one of the most important things I’ve learned in my time here. This is what gave me enough freedom to switch my concentrations as I shifted my focus to what I wanted, not what I thought my family would want for me.
It’s taken a lot of steps and development of the relationship I have with myself to recognize that my rest is also resistance. It’s taken relationships where I was putting in too much emotional labor and unpaid positions for me to recognize that my time is valuable.
It feels great to say no to requests that I would have only agreed to because I felt guilted into them. It feels great to now be able to say I’m getting compensated for most of the work I’m doing — and that it’s work I’m passionate about. I get compensated for my job in the admissions office reaching out to first-generation students. I get compensated for my research thanks to Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program. And I get compensated for writing these pieces thanks to The Crimson’s Financial Aid program.
I look back to the Audre Lorde quote and realize how simple it seems. It seems so instinctual that you should always be putting yourself first. I had assumed I was already doing that. It took too long for me to recognize I actually wasn’t.
Our oppressions and hardships have been transferred to the individual to the point where it becomes our responsibility to lift ourselves up from the anxiety, depression, and constant self-doubt and pain created by a system built for its own selfish motives. But we can’t fight that system if we keep tricking ourselves into believing we can do it all. We shouldn’t have to put on a brave face at all times. We must recognize our worth, give ourselves time to rest and heal, and get back out there when we know we can give the world our best selves. With radical resistance comes radical self-love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to a recent nationwide survey on compensation in higher education, tenured female professors at Harvard make 92.5 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. Harvard’s pay gap ranked roughly in the middle of the Ivy League. The gap is worse than those at Brown and Yale, where tenured female faculty receive 95 cents on the dollar, but better than Dartmouth’s 82.5 cents.
While we acknowledge that Harvard’s pay rate is for female faculty is decently above the national gender pay gap of 85 cents per dollar and is only a few cents shy of the most equal paying schools in the Ivy League, we are still far from content. The gender pay gap at Harvard, other universities, and all employers across the nation should have been closed long ago. Though 92.5 cents per dollar is marginally better than the 2015 surveyed figure of 92.3 cents, this gap is still egregious merely by virtue of the fact that it is not parity. We will not be satisfied until all female faculty members — tenured, associate, assistant, and instructor — are making one dollar for every dollar earned by male faculty.
But this statistic tells only part of the story. We are still more disappointed by the fact that that only 27 percent of current tenured faculty are female. That female professors constitute only slightly over a quarter of tenured faculty at the University while about half of the College student body is female is both practically and ideologically unacceptable. Female students will be looking for role models who can speak to the specificity of their experiences, and a narrower pool of female professors puts them at a disadvantage in this search and may adversely impact their education.
In order to better understand and tackle this problem, we wish to see the gender pay gap data from this survey stratified by discipline to see if certain fields have worse pay gaps than others. We would also like to see the average pay data for all professors stratified by discipline, as we are concerned that professors in typically male-dominated departments like STEM could be making more than professors in departments that are unfairly associated with “feminine” occupations, such as the humanities, and that this trend could be used to justify the existing pay gap. Even if females are paid comparably to men within the same discipline, professors in a typically male-dominated disciplines could be earning more than a female-dominated disciplines. If this were the case, the problem at hand would take on a different form: namely, lifting up the women who do good academic work in these disciplines to bring them to the highest levels of academia.
We would also like to see professor compensation stratified along other types of diversity, such as race and sexuality, so that any pay gaps in those respects can be both observed and rectified — particularly for women of color or for professors who are BGLTQ-identifying. The gender pay gap and pay gaps affecting other minority groups at Harvard and beyond are a multidimensional, systemic problem that cannot be analyzed with only two columns of numbers. Harvard must work towards full transparency in pursuit of full equality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Climate change is happening. This we know. There is no longer time to deny the facts.
Last year we saw flames engulf coastal California; hurricanes ravish the Carolinas; temperatures climb to new heights in Southern California; floods and droughts imposing themselves across the globe. All of these incidents of climate extremes had been, and continue to be, foreshadowed by science — they were not without the scope of human knowledge nor vision.
And yet, in the midst of tragedy, environmental degradation, and human suffering, Harvard remains silent, hiding behind the notion that the University’s research efforts are the best way to combat the foe we humans have created. Such rhetoric that absolves the University’s nearly $40 billion endowment of any responsibility in the discussion of climate change is not only naïve, but cowardly. The United Nations declared climate change one of the most pressing social issues of our time, and Harvard’s investment in fossil fuel companies belies all notions of moral stewardship the University boasts all while illuminating the University’s true intentions: Profit. Regardless of the expense.
Research alone will not allay the repercussions of global climate change, which will exert disproportionate effects on low-income communities, those of color, and those of the Global South. To hide behind the notion that the endowment should be apolitical is not only historically false, but morally reprehensible. The way in which we allocate our money is of course political: It is a demonstration of what we — as people, as institutions, as societies —are willing to support and what we are not.
Surely, Harvard’s ultimate 1990 divestiture from tobacco companies was inherently political, coming in tandem with a letter from then-University President Derek C. Bok stating that the decision was motivated by the “unjustified risk of harm to other human beings.” Similarly, Harvard’s decision to only partially divest from companies doing business in apartheid South Africa was equally political. Such a decision demonstrated Harvard’s commitment to growing its endowment, regardless of the consequences its remaining holdings produced in maintaining an insidious governmental system of racial classification and discrimination which had undoubted effects on the black and brown lifecourse in South Africa. Thus, every move Harvard makes with its endowment is political. Believing in and reacting responsibly to scientific truths, however, should not be construed as such.
Focusing on the question of politics ultimately obscures Harvard’s moral suasion in fostering a just society. While ensuring the longevity of the endowment for future Harvard students and scholars is important, it is not mutually exclusive from cultivating a just Harvard — and more importantly — a just world. Climate change is inherently an intersectional issue that bleeds into all facets of society. Already its effects are pushing people out of their homelands, placing their lives in limbo. Already it is harming communities of color to a greater extent than their white counterparts. And already it is affecting poor and developing countries to a greater extent than wealthy and developed nations.
The trial on divestment that Harvard then faces is not about the political leanings of the University, but rather on the morality of holding investments that propagate human and environmental suffering. It is not a revolutionary vision to strive to construct a world, an endowment, that does not hierarchize our education, our institution, above the very livelihoods of others. Nor is it revolutionary to see that the challenge of climate change is inherently linked to the private prison industry’s profiteering off the caging of human beings and Puerto Rico’s looming debt resulting from colonial rule. With the resource and privilege to weather the most extreme effects of climate change when they hit Cambridge, Harvard must now ask itself: Is growing the endowment worth being complicit in the destruction of our very world — our very future, as we know it — regardless of Harvard’s own ability to adapt to a new climate order?
With a nearly $40 billion dollar endowment, Harvard possesses immense weight in the conversation of divestment. To forget the extreme level of influence the endowment and Harvard name holds is to engage in a dangerous pattern of selective memory. Already, universities across the world have committed to divesting from fossil fuels. Should Harvard choose the moral high road, it will not assume the role of leader, but it’s moral stance on the issue will still bear weight.
The time to divest is not now. The time to divest was not when student activists first started their calls for the University to utilize its endowment in a responsible manner. The time to divest was immediately when knowledge surfaced that the burning of fossil fuels largely contributes to climate change, that the prison industrial complex largely profits from holding black and brown bodies, that Puerto Rican debt is a direct result from modern-day colonial practices. All Harvard can do now is evaluate its principles and decide to hold itself, as an institution, to the same standards it holds it students to in its motto and mission statement: truth and being the leaders of our global, interconnected societies.
Harvard’s Climate Action Plan has established the goal of becoming fossil fuel-free by 2050. This ambition is merely performative should Harvard not include its indirect carbon emissions in this goal. On Friday, activists “flooded” Harvard to call on the University, once again, to divest its holdings from companies that profit off suffering as a part of Harvard “Heat Week”. Should Harvard choose to divest, it will be thanks to the work of the activists involved in the three divestment campaigns on campus who have poured their free labor into the project of creating a more just world — a project Harvard claims to be involved in, too.
But in order for the selfless labor of student activists to be fully realized, they will need cooperation from the administration. Should University President Lawrence S. Bacow continue to rely on the faulty notion of listening to reason not demands, then only two questions remain regarding divestment: Does Harvard have a conscience? And if so, will Bacow listen to it?

Hundreds of people gathered at Harvard to hear from prominent artists, scholars, and activists from across the nation about the intersection of art, race, and justice Thursday and Friday.
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study hosted the gathering, dubbed “Vision and Justice.” African and African American studies professor Sarah Lewis helped plan the events, which were open to the public, according to the meeting’s website.
“At Harvard we seek to bring the arts and humanities to the center of civic life, to bring them to the hardest questions, including questions of justice,” Dean of the Arts and Humanities Division Robin E. Kelsey said at the event.
Several high-level University administrators — including University President Lawrence S. Bacow and former University President Drew G. Faust — also spoke at the convening.
Prominent national political and artistic figures also spoke — including Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton, Grammy Award-winning music producer Kasseem “Swizz Beatz” Dean, and American Repertory Theater artistic director Diane M. Paulus ’88.
Throughout the covening, panelists engaged in a number of events, including “Citizenship and Racial Narratives” and “Race, Technology and Algorithmic Bias.”
During a panel on Friday, Melody C. Barnes, former assistant to the United States president and director of the Obama White House Domestic Policy Council, and Damian Woetzel, president of the Juilliard School, spoke about the White House program Turnaround Arts. Hoping to improve arts education in the country, the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities founded Turnaround Arts in 2011 under the leadership of former First Lady Michelle Obama.
“Art and artists weren’t a decorative force. They were a productive part of society to be subsumed and part of the onward struggle that we were all putting our shoulders to,” Woetzel said about the Obama administration’s dedication to bridging the arts and policy.
During a panel titled “Race, Childhood, and Inequality in the Political Realm,” Naomi Wadler and Yara Shahidi ’22 discussed the experiences of black children in the U.S.
Wadler is a 12-year-old activist who gained national recognition for her speech about remembering black women who are victims of gun violence at the National March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C. in March 2018. Shahidi is an actress and activist, known for her starring role in the sitcom "Black-ish" and its spin-off series "Grown-ish."
“[For black children], there’s a temporariness to being an adult. You are placed in the category of adult when it’s convenient and can be quickly taken out when you’re then in a position to defend yourself,” Shahidi said about the idea that black children are inappropriately seen as adults and disciplined more harshly.
Bryan A. Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, said during a Friday panel titled “Mass Incarceration and Visual Narratives” that he supports the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign’s efforts calling on Harvard to divest from the prison industry.
“Does ‘Veritas’ mean we must lead? I think it does,” Stevenson said.
Stevenson concluded the two-day convening with a keynote speech in Sanders Theater. He shared personal stories from his childhood and urged the audience to pursue justice through art and storytelling.
“You don’t have to be the most talented and gifted artist. You don’t have to be the best sculptor. You don’t have to be the best photographer. You may not have the skills of some of the people who have gotten on this stage. You may not or have all of the answers,” he said.
“But if you have a heart and a mind and willingness to change narratives, if you’ve got some hope, if you’ll do some uncomfortable things, you’ll contribute to the justice quotient that we’re trying to create in this country,” he added.

Harvard College unveiled a summer public service stipend for incoming freshmen in the Class of 2023 at an event Sunday morning.
Participants in the program — called “Service Starts with Summer” — will receive a $1,500 stipend to pursue 100 hours of community service in their hometowns, both in the United States and abroad. College Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba, who currently serves as the interim dean for public service, said she expects to accept all applicants to the program.
In addition to their main projects, participants will join webinars and discuss their individual projects in online sessions facilitated by Kevin L. Ballen ’22 and Nicholas C. Hargis ’19.
Ballen wrote in an email that he joined the summer service project as a result of other work he has done with administrators on “civic engagement initiatives.” He added that he thinks the project’s focus on service work in students’ own communities is important.
“One of the most meaningful components of this program is its hometown focus. On Campus, students (including myself) are so excited about exploring new places in their summers, during breaks, and after graduation,” Ballen wrote. “The emphasis on serving at home pushes us to think about how we can use our Harvard education/degree and all it comes with to strengthen our roots.”
Thimba said in a Friday interview the program comes as part of a broader effort to expand public service opportunities at Harvard. She said the idea for the program stemmed from University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s inaugural speech in October 2018.
“The program started as a response to President Bacow’s call at the inauguration that Harvard should be ready to provide summer internship opportunities in service for students — any student who wants one,” she said.
The program will ask participants to find “high impact” public service projects in their hometowns and will provide them with faculty and staff support over the course of their pursuits, according to Thimba. Each of the public service projects is expected to last five weeks.
Participants must complete the full 100 hours in order to receive College funding, which will be pulled from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s discretionary fund. Thimba said that students who complete fewer than 100 hours can still participate in the online component of the program and events the College plans to hold for participants once they arrive on campus in the fall, but will not receive the stipend.
The announcement comes as the College searches for a new Dean of Public Service following Gene A. Corbin’s decision to step down from the post more than a year ago. In the months since, administrators announced a review of public service initiatives aimed at undergraduates and began a search for an assistant dean for civic engagement and service, a newly minted role.
Thimba said the College would launch a website for the program and reach out to all accepted students with more information about the program this week. She added that applications for the program are slated to open Friday and are due by May 31.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow joined five other Massachusetts university and college presidents in urging United States Representative Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) to repeal the endowment tax set to be levied on Harvard’s next filings in a letter last month.
Neal is chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the 1.4 percent excise tax on endowment returns at institutions with endowments greater than $500,000 per student.
Harvard’s endowment, the largest University endowment in the world at nearly $40 billion, qualifies for taxation under the 2017 Republican-led Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The University’s endowment was previously exempt from taxes because the school is a non-profit entity.
The letter stated that Massachusetts is “disproportionately” affected since the state is home to six out of the 30 schools anticipated to fall under the tax, and who are estimated to pay about 40 percent of the revenue raised by the tax.
“We anticipate the first payments under this provision are likely to be due later this year and hope that you and your colleagues will move to address it with some urgency,” the letter reads. “The impact of this pernicious tax will grow significantly over time, as more institutions are affected, and the levy erodes our philanthropic resources.”
“We believe that this must be addressed swiftly and definitively to ensure that no precedent is set for such a damaging tax,” the letter added.
Signatories of the letter include Bacow, Amherst President Biddy Martin, MIT President L. Rafael Reif, Smith College President Kathleen McCartney, Wellesley College President Paula A. Johnson ’80, and Williams College President Maud S. Mandel.
The letter also projected the tax’s likely negative impact on financial aid.
“At all our schools, the neediest undergraduates receive grants that cover not just tuition but most of their other costs as well,” the letter reads. “This tax, purportedly motivated to address cost and encourage aid, will make these policies harder to sustain and expand.”
Harvard lobbied to prevent the tax for years before it became law. Bacow has also traveled to Washington, D.C. several times since he took office last year urging legislators to repeal the tax. Both Bacow and his predecessor, former University President Drew G. Faust, have objected to the tax, often citing the increase in cost of higher education and threat to financial aid.
In a March interview, Bacow indicated that Neal’s appointment as chair of the Ways and Means Committee and Rep. James P. McGovern’s (D-Mass.) appointment as chair of the House Rules Committee provided Harvard a “better shot” of getting Congress to revisit the endowment tax.
“This tax disproportionately affects Massachusetts and I think both Congressman Neal and Congressman McGovern understand that,” Bacow said at the time. “They're in a position now to be helpful in ways that they weren't before.”
Even with the endowment tax’s first filing drawing near, Harvard is still awaiting federal guidance on how to file taxes under the new law. Endowment returns from fiscal year 2019 will be the first taxed under the new code.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council debated and voted on two proposals Sunday that, combined, rendered the president and vice president ineligible to propose legislation and vote, overturning more than 40 years of precedent.
UC members first questioned the president’s and vice president’s voting eligibility last week, when Cabot House Representative Brandon M. Martinez ’20 pointed out that the UC’s constitution only states that “members” can vote. Both the president and vice president are considered “executive officers,” not explicitly members.
The UC sought to clarify this ambiguity and first voted on Sunday to create a committee to interpret the constitution. After the UC then failed to pass a proposal that would deem the president and vice president members, the newly formed committee stepped in to strip the duo of their voting powers.
The UC president and vice president have been able to vote for at least the past 40 years, according to Treasurer Jack M. Swanson ’22, who examined past UC records.
The two pieces of legislation were part of a series of acts that the sponsors called the “Great Reform.”
The first proposal, dubbed the “Great Compromise,” specified the committee to interpret the constitution comprises the rules committee chair, the parliamentarian, and the secretary. The current rules committee chair Michael Y. Cheng ’22; parliamentarian Rachel L. Reynolds ’22,  who is also a Crimson blog editor; and secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, who is also a former Crimson sports chair, co-sponsored this piece of legislation along with Martinez.
The proposal passed 23-6-4.
The other piece of legislation, which designated the president and vice president as full members with voting powers, failed to pass with a vote of 27-0-7. Because 7 people abstained, the proposal could not pass. Any amendment to the UC’s constitution requires two-thirds of the entire council — 31 students — to vote either in favor of or against the legislation.
Many representatives said they voted for the proposal because they think the president and vice president need the ability to propose legislation in order to carry out the platform that they ran on.
Dunster House Representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 said that the UC president and vice president have special meetings with administrators. Insight gained from these meetings can then influence the legislation they propose.
Some of the representatives who abstained said they believe the president’s and vice president’s ability to vote represents an imbalance in power.
Because the president and vice president lose their seats in their houses, they do not count towards the three representatives that each House typically receives. Some said this policy overrepresents the president’s and vice president’s houses on the Council.
Others countered the idea that enfranchising the president and vice president creates a power imbalance. They said the pair represent the student body at large because they were elected by the entire student body.
“The president and vice president are voted on by the entire student body,” Mather House Representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 said. “Their platform is held accountable to the entire student body.”
Some representatives also said they are concerned that a president could essentially receive two votes in the case of a tie because the president can both vote and break a tie.
Because the legislation failed, the committee to interpret the constitution made their first ruling. They decided that the president and vice president are not members of the council, codifying that the pair will be ineligible to vote on and propose legislation at future meetings. The president will still be able to break ties.
The other piece of the Great Reform, which would have delegated all powers not explicitly given to the members of the Executive Board to the general members of the UC, failed 7-19-7.

Roughly 60 Harvard affiliates gathered at the Harvard Chabad House Sunday evening in solidarity with the Chabad of Poway, Calif., where a deadly shooting took place Saturday.
Hirschy Zarchi, Jewish chaplain and Rabbi at Harvard Chabad, organized the vigil along with his wife, Elkie Zarchi. Speakers at the gathering included University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76; MIT Jewish chaplain Menachem Altein; Jewish chaplain and Rabbi at Harvard Hillel Jonah C. Steinberg; Jewish chaplain and Rabbi at Harvard Hillel, and International Jewish Student Center of Boston Directors Berel Grunblatt and Esther L. Grunblatt.
On Saturday, a gunman shouting anti-Semitic slurs opened fire in the Chabad of Poway, killing one and wounding three. Several of the victims had left Israel for America to escape regional violence. Police took the suspect, a 19-year-old man, into custody and charged him with one count of first degree murder.
The attack took place exactly six months after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Penn. in October. Saturday is also the Jewish Sabbath and was the last day of Passover.
Zarchi, the first to speak, said Saturday morning’s tragedy should be an opportunity for recalling what unites the Jewish community. He described Judaism as an affirmation of life and pledged to redouble Chabad’s efforts to promote and protect Jewish values.
“Poway, Pittsburgh, or Jerusalem, when Jews are targeted simply for being Jewish, those who hate us do not differentiate based on other labels. But at the same time, we must not give into panic or bitterness,” Zarchi said.
Several speakers acknowledged Saturday’s proximity to recent acts of violence in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Garber said he thinks recent hate-driven massacres of Muslims and Christians in addition to anti-Semitic acts “have contributed to a feeling that this is a time of deep division.”
“There has never been a more important time to show what resilient and loving communities can do,” Garber said.
He added that Chabad represents the “best of what we are.”
Garber also read out loud a statement on behalf of University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who could not attend due to a conflict, extending his support to members of Chabad and those affected by the shooting.
Both Zarchi and Steinberg said the tragedy could turn into an opportunity to celebrate faith.
“We’re here in sorrow and outrage and anger, and I want to say that I’m here in joy at what this community is and what we can be,” Steinberg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly one hundred students, alumni, and Cambridge residents braved the cold and rain to rally for fossil fuel divestment in Tercentenary Theatre Friday, bringing Heat Week to a close.
Heat Week first began in April 2015 as a week-long protest organized by Divest Harvard — a fossil fuel divestment advocacy group. At the time, students and faculty members blockaded Massachusetts Hall for a week, occupied the Harvard Alumni Association headquarters for two days, and blockaded University Hall multiple times.
This year, after a week of panels, teach-ins, and civil disobedience training, ralliers gathered Friday to listen to speeches from climate change activists and Harvard affiliates; sing songs about the environment; and chant divestment slogans.
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern, who spoke at the rally, called on Harvard and other local colleges and universities “to do more and to do better” and divest from the fossil fuel industry.
“I acknowledge the groundbreaking research and scientific advancements that are happening in our city,” McGovern said. “Those are important; those are important to further change in the world and improve things, but that’s not enough.”
“Despite the outcry, despite the science, they’re not listening to our voices. They seem to be blind to what is happening every day,” he added.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to his previous statements about fossil fuel divestment.
“The University’s position, as it has stated previously, is that it should not use the endowment to achieve political ends, or particular policy ends,” Swain wrote in an email. "As President Larry Bacow has said, the University agrees with the urgent need to tackle climate change and has valued the opportunity to discuss the issues with members of the community. Harvard is committed to influencing public policy on climate change through scholarship and research.”
At the rally, Divest Harvard organizer Ilana A. Cohen ’22 outlined the group’s list of demands regarding divestment. The list included pushing administrators to disclose the school’s investments in the fossil fuel industry, completely divest, and reinvest the endowment in “sustainable and socially responsible funds.” Cohen also called for the University to end its ownership of farmlands in California and other areas of the world.
She gave the University the deadline of Earth Day 2020 to meet these goals.
‘This is not a question of science, it is a question of will,” Cohen said. “We cannot wait for the President Bacows of the world to wake up and decide to do the right thing.”
Divestment activists for other causes also made an appearance at the rally. Salma Abdelrahman ’20, a member of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, spoke to the lively crowd about the group’s advocacy for divestment from companies with ties to the prison industry.
“We will continue to use civil disobedience as civil discourse until our voices are heard and until the University administration commits to a vision of our community that is not financed by the caging of black and brown people,” Abdelrahman said.
The HPDC and Divest Harvard teamed up earlier this month to interrupt an event at the Harvard Kennedy School’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum where Bacow was slated to speak. The event was moved to a nearby classroom after protestors occupied the stage.
Prior to the rally, Divest Harvard planned and executed a week of public actions and speaker events about divestment. At a press conference kicking off Heat Week, faculty members and prominent alumni urged the administration to divest. The group also invited former politicians, alumni, and activists to give advice to student activists on campus.
On Tuesday, Divest Harvard painted a globe in the middle of the Science Center and educated passersby about their cause.
Divestment even crept into discussions at Visitas, the College’s annual weekend for admitted students. At the President’s Welcome in Sanders Theatre Saturday, Bacow fielded two questions from prospective students about divestment. He argued that instead of divesting, the University should engage with the fossil fuel industry through its scholarship.
Bacow even mentioned that he is a vegetarian, citing this lifestyle as “one way to minimize your carbon footprint.”
Members of Divest Harvard and HPDC also hung banners in Annenberg Hall, the freshman dining hall, and passed out pamphlets about their movements to prospective students.
Cohen said she believed Heat Week was a success because it helped Divest Harvard educate more people about its mission.
“Even if they're not going to show up at the rallies, even if they're not the same people who are there organizing on a groundwork level, I think that we've brought new people into common spaces, and helped spread awareness of the work that we’re doing and the importance of divestment,” Cohen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Regarded as arguably the best offensive lineman in Dallas Cowboys history, NFL Hall of Famer Larry Allen proudly represented “America’s Team” for 12 seasons. In his final three seasons with Dallas, the 11-time Pro Bowler was teammates with a blossoming young tight end named Jason Witten.
Now, Witten is officially teammates with Larry’s son.
On Sunday afternoon, the Dallas Cowboys announced the signing of Harvard senior and undrafted free agent Larry Allen Jr.,. A 2018 first-team All-Ivy selection, Allen Jr., has been a stalwart offensive guard for the Crimson since 2015, starting in 30 out of 30 possible games in that span.
“[I was] just kind of stunned and had a lot of emotions,” said Allen Jr., after the signing was finalized. “Not just getting a shot to play, but I lived in Dallas for a long time so if there was one team to get a chance with it, it was them.”
Allen Jr.’s father was quick to congratulate his son on social media, stating succinctly, “Proud of Son” in a tweet soon after the news broke.
“I’m very happy for Larry but not at all surprised,” said fellow senior classmate and offensive lineman Matt Jones. “He has worked hard for this moment for years and it’s great to see it finally happen.”
Allen Jr., is one of about 15 unsigned free agents chosen by the Cowboys after the conclusion of the 2019 NFL Draft on Saturday. The bioengineering concentrator will head down to Frisco from May 9-11 to attend Cowboys rookie minicamp before graduation, and commented on the familiarity both with The Lone Star State but also with numerous current members of the Cowboys organization.
“There are still a fair amount of people there that played with [my father],” Allen Jr., said. “Jason Garrett was the quarterback there when my dad played there...the offensive line coach Marc Colombo, he played with my dad.”
Allen Jr. also commented that he will have the opportunity to reunite with some members of the organization who “as a teenager, was a coach” as well as the aforementioned Witten, who returns back to the field after spending a year in the broadcast booth for Monday Night Football.
The Danville, Calif., native is the most recent Crimson offensive lineman to be signed to a NFL professional contract since Max Rich ’17 and will reunite with center Adam Redmond ’16, who was claimed off waivers by Dallas on Sept. 2 after stints with the Buffalo Bills and Indianapolis Colts. Other Crimson linemen currently in the NFL include Cole Toner ’16, Anthony Fabiano ’16, and Nick Easton ’15, all of whom have played with Allen Jr., in his time in Cambridge.
“It has meant so much,” Allen Jr., said. “The people I have met, the coaches. It’s been rocky at times, but it’s been some of the best football I have ever played. I had some of the best teammates I have ever had here.”
Coach Tim Murphy commented in particular on the accomplishments and off-the-field contributions of the senior class.
“I don’t know when I’ve been more proud of a football team in my 25 years as a head coach here,” said Murphy following the Crimson’s 45-27 victory at Harvard-Yale on Nov. 17. “Extraordinary senior leadership, and that is absolutely, positively what drove the team this year.”
Outside of Allen Jr., defensive linemen Richie Ryan and Stone Hart as well as offensive lineman Ben Shoults participated in Harvard Football’s Pro Day in March. The three have not heard back from NFL teams as of Sunday night, according to Allen Jr. The Cowboys signee believed that “no doubt they will have a shot” and praised the work ethic of his fellow classmates.
Allen Jr.’s teammates and coach were quick to reciprocate the same praise.
“He can make it at the next level,” Jones said. “Obviously he has the pedigree, but he also has the work ethic and athleticism to make it.”
"Larry Allen is without a doubt, one of the greatest offensive guards in Harvard and Ivy football history," Murphy stated. "Beyond that, he is one of the most well liked and respected kids in our program."
This past season, 10 former Harvard players were employed by a NFL side, highlighted by current Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk ’13, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Cameron Brate ’13-’14.
Allen Jr. will have a substantial road ahead to join that esteemed list. But for now, he can take pride in knowing he is, so far, the only senior who will walk through Tercentenary Theatre next month with “NFL athlete” to his name.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It’s windy – try it again!”
Elizabeth Shively is not one to give up easily. After twenty-one innings of behind-the-plate sitting and pulls-her-weight hitting, the catcher in crimson was still going strong in this weekend’s series against Yale – but a an ill-fated foul-tip was about to change all that. With Harvard up by one at the top of the seventh, Bulldog infielder Annie Tarte back-launched the softball off her bat and straight into Shively’s helmet, prompting a mid-game timeout and the performance of the oh-so-dreaded concussion test. But after one failed attempt at the evaluation, Shively was not deterred; instead, she turned bleacher-wise to the trainer, shouting, “It’s windy – try it again!”
Although Shively was escorted to the dugout after failing that second concussion test, and Harvard off the field after giving up its late-game lead to Yale, Shively’s mantra of strength and perseverance defined this weekend’s series win for the Crimson.
“I think we did a really good job with winning the series this weekend,” said senior captain Katie Duncan. “Obviously the last game didn’t go how we wanted it to, but there’s a lot of good things that we did and things that we can work on to be better next weekend.”
The only thing more nerve-wracking than watching Harvard battle the Bulldogs this Sunday was witnessing an absent-minded toddler almost promenade into the bat of a Harvard slugger during batting practice, and even that may be an understatement (for those of you following along at home, don’t worry – the teetering tot was scooped up by a concerned fan before she could be launched out to right field).
After a Meagan Lantz homer at the bottom of the fourth and a lead-taking single by the same batter during the subsequent inning, it seemed as if the Crimson were about to secure the series sweep – but then the Bulldogs growled back. After a four-run hit-streak at the top of the seventh, Yale all but flashed V-for-victory; a bottom-of-the-inning shutout handed the win to the Bulldogs. However, Duncan credits her teammates with making several SportsCenter-worthy plays.
“I think Meagan [Lantz’s] homerun in the last game was great,” said Duncan. “I also thought the offense in general did a really good job, and hitters one through nine were just consistently were going at it. Elizabeth [Shively] behind the plate and in the batter’s box had an unbelievable weekend too.”
On the weekend, Lantz went 4-for-9, securing three RBIs and a perfect batting average during Harvard’s final game against Yale. Her fourth-inning homerun brought the water-logged crowd to its feet, a high point in the Crimson’s series win at home.
“I just really wanted to help my team in any way I could and get on base, whether that be by a walk, error, or hit-by-pitch,” Lantz said. “I really just wanted to bring energy for the team and do what I could to help in any way.”
However, Lantz doesn’t crown herself series MVP; rather, she credits infielder Rhianna Rich with taking the title of this weekend’s star player.
“I would just say that Rhianna Rich made some really great plays at short this weekend,” Lantz said. “There was a play yesterday where the ball tipped off Teagan Shaw’s glove and Rhianna picked it up, stepped on third, and tried to throw it home for the play. She just makes plays like that all the time, and it’s great playing next to her because she does stuff like that regularly.”
This weekend was certainly full of clutch moments for the Crimson, the majority of which came in their first two matches against the Bulldogs. A first-inning triple by freshman Trina Hoang careened the Crimson to scoreboard during their first game against Yale, and a sixth-inning RBI by sophomore Morgan Melito secured a 7-6 victory for Harvard. The Crimson kept that momentum going into the second game of the doubleheader, with Harvard runs scored in five of six innings, propelling the Crimson to a 7-1 win and the series victory.
“We did some really great things this weekend,” Lantz said. “Obviously people look at the standings and its tight, but I thought we were in a really good position to do some great things and we did. We came out here and took two on Saturday, and even did some great things in [Sunday’s] game by really just focusing on every pitch and every inning.”
Looking forward, the squad is ready to make the transition from Bulldog to Big Red as they take on Cornell in next weekend’s home series.
“I think our mentality is pretty much the same every weekend,” Duncan said. “It’s just getting prepared to play our best game. Next weekend happens to be at home against Cornell, so [we] just need to go back and work on the little things[…] so that we can hopefully walk away happier next weekend.”
For Harvard, next weekend’s series against the Big Red will be near-identical to this last one against Yale: they’ll be playing on the same field, at the same times, against a team from the same conference. However, next weekend will bring with it one big change – this time, Harvard will be shooting for the series sweep. After all, even without the wind, the Crimson are all about trying again.

This past January, Urban Outfitters — formerly located in between Sweetgreen and the Curious George store — closed down. Its absence left a hole in the hearts of countless hipsters and an even larger one on JFK Street of Harvard Square. In light of this, we set out to gauge what Harvard freshmen really want to see move in. Here’s what we found:
An overwhelming majority of freshmen called for more restaurant options in the Square:
“I’d have to say a restaurant of some kind, Chick-fil-A would be nice if they could make it work, maybe an ice cream place. Honestly just food, I’m more of a food guy than like a clothes guy” commented Connor S. Dowd ’22.
Many freshmen agreed, including Britteny C. Okorom-Achuonye ’22 who said, “I want to see more affordable dining, like cheaper restaurants.”
Caroline A. Conway ’22 added to the restaurant chorus, saying, “I’d really like it if it was some kind of food cafeteria style place, like how Boston Public Market is. I feel like a lot of healthier, cheaper food options would be very nice.”
One freshman did not want to stray too far from already well-established favorites like Santouka. “I think the Urban Outfitters store should be a ramen place,” said Hayato Shiotsu ’22.
Others called for more basic food sources, like grocery stores and co-ops:
Tyler T. Johnston ’22, a Crimson FM editor, had a creative idea to increase access to fresh produce, saying, “I think a community farming co-op would be really cool, where students can go and get decently priced, organic, sustainable food.”
Some just wanted a basic grocery store, like Nathaniel B. Liberman ’22, who said, “In that space a grocery store like a Whole Foods would be very nice.”
Kyle O. Fridberg ’22 agreed, calling for “an affordable grocery store because there just aren’t that many [cheap] options in Harvard Square and just generally near Harvard for reasonably priced food.”
A few brave souls ventured outside of food-related options:
Iyabo B. Awogboro ‘22 wanted “something activity-based so maybe like an escape room or bowling alley — something we could go out and do without having to go all the way into Boston.”
Instead of entertainment, one freshman wanted to see retail come in. Samantha C. O’Sullivan ’22 said, “In the Urban space I’d like to see a thrift store with really cheap clothes.”
And some freshmen were simply done with the closure saga entirely:
James T. Devaney ’22, one such freshman, stated, “I am completely ambivalent.” Looks like anything but an empty space will do.
While we may still be mourning the loss of a place to buy last-minute clothing and birthday presents, we can look forward to something new on the horizon. Here’s to hoping that some of the wishes of the class of 2022 are granted.
