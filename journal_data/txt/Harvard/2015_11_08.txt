After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
American courts should pay attention to foreign countries’ legal interpretations and challenges, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer argued at the Kennedy School of Government on Friday.
Although some people might reasonably be worried about undermining American values and American sovereignty in considering decisions of foreign courts, Breyer said the success of the American democratic experiment depended on the United States’ ability to look beyond its shores.
“The best way to preserve American values is to try help deal with these problems, and that requires a little participation and at least knowledge about what’s going on outside our own boundaries,” said Breyer, a former professor at Harvard Law School and the Kennedy School.
A particular challenge for courts, Breyer added, is understanding how legal interpretations of similar statutes or systems in different countries conflict with one another, especially around issues of human rights.
“There’s got to be a system that works. It has to be uniform, and it has to be at least capable of harmony rather than just chaos,” Breyer said. “Now those are interpretative problems, and you cannot deal with those problems...without knowing what other countries are doing.”
Breyer gave his remarks at a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event at the Institute of Politics Friday afternoon, moderated by Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen and Law School lecturer Nancy Gertner.
When asked about his role in the creation of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines as part of the Federal Sentencing Commision in the late 1980s, Breyer said if given the choice, he would still re-implement the guidelines, despite their unpopularity.
“Study after study showed that the sentence was pretty dependent on whom you drew as the judge—that’s why they had to have a lottery wheel in the Southern district of New York,” Breyer said of the criminal justice system before the guidelines were enacted. “This was meant to be a movement—not perfection, but a movement—in the direction of focus on the individual…and [a] move to uniformity—if I had to do it over again, I think I’d do it.”
The moderators also asked Breyer to explain why he joined a dissenting opinion on the controversial Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission case. Breyer said that while he understood that money was inherently tied to speech in political campaigns, the ability—or at least potential—of very wealthy individuals to disrupt the connection between public opinion and the policymaking of elected officials and bodies was also a concerning First Amendment issue.
“When you have five people giving 20 million dollars each...and you have hundreds of millions giving 10 dollars each, it’s the big givers who will cut that connection” between the public and policy-making, he said. “Even if it weren’t true, people would think it was true and as long as they think it is true, there will not be any faith, necessary faith, in that institution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 9, 2015, at 3:45 p.m.
With the annual Harvard-Yale football game starting two hours later than in previous years, House Committees are preparing for a later-than-usual tailgate but expect restrictions and activities to remain the same as in the past.
In previous years, the Crimson took to the field against the Bulldogs around 12:30 p.m. But at this year’s Nov. 21 game in New Haven, kickoff will start at 2:30 p.m., a change prompted by requests from the NBC Sports Network airing the game, according to Andy Dunn, Yale’s senior associate athletics director.
Similar to past years, students may tailgate at the “student tailgate village” on the tennis courts of Yale’s Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center. But with the time change, tailgating will begin at 11 a.m. instead of 8:30 a.m. and will still last three and a half hours. 
The later start time is prompting relief from many Harvard House Committee chairs, who often wake up much earlier than most students to prepare for their tailgates.
“I think on the HoCo end and event planning end, it’s beneficial to us because we get a later start,” Eliot HoCo co-chair Jesus E. Moran ’16 said. “So that means we don’t have to be up at six in the morning to go set up tailgate or to go get food, or alcohol, or whatever the case may be.”
Although the start time is different, specific tailgating regulations have not changed since the last New Haven match-up, according to Dunn. In 2013, the first Game played in New Haven since a U-Haul accident at the 2011 matchup resulted in a woman’s death, Yale significantly tightened its tailgating policies. Under these policies, which closely resemble the notoriously strict policies that have been in place at Harvard for a number of years, hard alcohol, kegs, and glass containers are prohibited inside the student tailgate.
While some administrators have expressed concerns that The Game could feature excessive drinking this year given the later start time, some HoCo chairs said they do not expect problems.
“We’ll have full on food to make sure that if people are choosing to do that, because I guess they’ll be awake for a longer period potentially before The Game starts, that we are helping people make better choices,” Quincy House HoCo co-chair Gaby Ruiz-Colon ’16 said.
HoCo chairs expect to receive specific tailgating guidelines from the Office of Student Life later this week. In the meantime, students have raised other concerns related to The Game’s later end time; it will likely conclude after sundown.
“I’m more curious about how after The Game is going to go because it's going to be dark,” Adams House HoCo co-chair Santiago Pardo Sanchez ’16 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—This Saturday, Harvard football experienced a scare from an unlikely opponent and received salvation from an unlikely source.
The unlikely opponent was a Columbia side that contradicted a recent history of ineptitude with a performance defined by hard-nosed defense and timely offense.
Meanwhile, the unlikely salvation was something more familiar to Lions fans: a substitution penalty on a fourth-and-four with a minute left, preventing Columbia (2-6, 1-4 Ivy) from receiving a punt and potentially mounting a game-tying drive.
All told, the Crimson (7-0, 5-0) triumphed, 24-16. But the going was not always pretty.
“I thought our kids really battled,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Any time you win on the road, you’ll take it.”
One consistent bright spot for Harvard was freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley, who accumulated 270 total yards and two touchdowns.
On the first play of the fourth quarter, Shelton-Mosley collected a line-drive punt at the Crimson 14-yard line. He stepped forward, juked one defender, and scampered down the left sideline before disappearing into a multi-player scrum.
Then, to the excitement of the Harvard bench and astonishment of the Columbia crowd, he reappeared, skipping out of an ankle-level tackle to break for the 86-yard score.
“Last week, it was [senior Andrew Fischer] making punt returns, so it’s not really the guy that’s back there,” Shelton-Mosley said. “I was able to get some really good blocks and just keep running, keep moving my feet.”
That Houdini return pushed the score to 24-3, the largest lead the Crimson would enjoy throughout the day.
However, the Lions responded on the very next possession. Two minutes into the fourth quarter, the Crimson brought a heavy blitz, but quarterback Anders Hill released the ball under pressure, finding receiver Cameron Dunn for a wide open 51-yard catch-and-run.
The score stood at 24-9 following a missed Columbia extra point. After a pair of Harvard three-and-outs, the Lions took over at their own 32-yard line. The ensuing drive ended with a three-yard rollout pass to tight end John Hunton, narrowing the deficit to eight points.
Although the following onside kick rolled into the hands of senior wide receiver Seitu Smith, the final result was not certain until sophomore punter Zach Schmid trotted out for a kick—and trotted back to the sidelines after the 12-man penalty.
“I thought we gave great effort and played with tremendous energy and resolve,” Columbia coach Al Bagnoli said. “But honestly, we made more mistakes than we should be making in week eight.”
Late-game sloppiness mirrored early-game sloppiness for both teams. For the second consecutive week, the Harvard offense failed to notch first-quarter points, had a punt blocked, and missed a field goal in the second quarter. Columbia gave up a blocked field goal attempt of its own.
Still, midway through the second quarter, the Crimson received the ball at its six-yard line with a chance to break a scoreless tie.
Harvard seized the opportunity, and on the fifth play from scrimmage, senior tight end Ben Braunecker broke free for a 53-yard touchdown reception.
The score came after Lions cornerback Matthew Cahal slipped while in coverage as the tight end curled up and around. When the ball arrived, Braunecker was unmarked—free to jog the rest of the way to the end zone.
Columbia’s first points also came thanks to a touch of luck—in this case a Hosch interception that bounced off the hands of junior tight end Anthony Firkser and into the chest of defensive back Travis Reim.
After the turnover, Columbia started at the Crimson 43-yard line and soon set up a first-and-goal from the five. But the Harvard defense held and only surrendered a field goal, with senior linebacker Eric Medes making the critical play when he batted away a third-down pass attempt.
The field goal represented Columbia’s first points against the Crimson since 2011.
Earlier in the quarter, a fumble by Shelton-Mosley off an attempted fair catch had also given the Lions a chance to close the deficit. In this instance, the Harvard defense stepped up on the first play, pressuring quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg into throwing a limp interception to linebacker Matt Koran.
However, the Crimson defense was not the only unit to respond when called. The Columbia front seven did just that as well, limiting running back Paul Stanton to a season-low 51 yards on 14 attempts.
“For us, we went into it, we wanted to be able to try and contain the run game,” Bagnoli said. “Force the quarterback to throw the ball and make completions.”
But Harvard made Columbia pay through the passing game. In addition to Shelton-Mosley’s performance, Braunecker tallied 130 yards receiving, and Hosch eclipsed 250 passing yards for the fourth straight contest.
Harvard exhibited this strength late in the second quarter, as the offense moved 72 yards in four plays. The drive ended when Shelton-Mosley caught the ball at the left numbers, lost his defender with a sideline cut, and dove for the pylon. 14-0, Crimson.
Following the score, the game action came to a halt when Crimson defensive back Tanner Lee smashed into a Columbia blocker on a kickoff return. The collision left Lee lying on the ground, eventually forcing an ambulance to drive onto the field and retrieve him in a stretcher.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the men’s basketball team closes out its preseason with a scrimmage against McGill on Saturday afternoon, Crimson beat writer David Freed details three things to keep an eye on.
1. Spacing The Floor — The discussion of how to replace star point guard senior Siyani Chambers centers around his leadership and his passing. Chambers knows the in and outs of the offense down to a T, having run it for three years. This simplistic analysis ignores Chambers’ shooting ability. The career 38 percent shooter has become less accurate with age, but provided crucial shooting to an offense that went scoreless for long periods. Junior Corbin Miller is the team’s best shooter, but is ineffective off the dribble. The returning starters—senior Agunwa Okolie and junior Zena Edosomwan—provided nothing by way of shooting last year. Head coach Tommy Amaker has pledged to create spacing by posting up Edosomwan inside, hoping that he draws double-teams to open up space for shooters. Saturday is the first test of a theory that will merit scrutiny this year.
2. Chatfield’s Emergence — The sophomore averaged just under 10 minutes a game as a freshmen, demonstrating the length and shooting that made him a prized recruit out of Georgia. The team hopes that he can make a leap to be more of a slasher on the wing, but it isn’t clear that he will even crack the starting lineup. His progress may prove to be a good barometer for that of the team.
3. Defending At The Point — A frustrating player offensively, Chambers is a tenacious defender who has improved considerably on the less sexy end of the floor over his three years. His replacements are, in a word, incomparable. Junior Corbin Miller has not yet shown the agility and foot speed to keep up with high-quality opposing guards, and junior Matt Fraschilla faces a significant size deficit. Freshman Tommy McCarthy hasn’t had a chance to flash on-ball defense to this point, but will face a significant adjustment in moving up to the college level. Amaker’s teams are built on their defense—which is often among the best in the nation—and for a team short on offensive firepower, containing at the point of attack is a crucial priority.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the Harvard men’s hockey team easily passed through Brown in the first round of the ECAC Tournament, bombarding the Bears’ defense with 64 shots—10 of which caught twine—throughout the duration of the two-game sweep.
While pieces have shifted for both teams since last March, the picture remains the same today.
Behind pairs of goals from senior forward Jimmy Vesey and freshman Ryan Donato, the No. 7/6 Harvard (3-0-1, 3-0-1 ECAC) notched its third win of the season, comfortably handling Brown (0-3,0-2), 5-2, to remain undefeated on the year.
“The first five minutes of the game we just weren’t dialed in the way needed to be,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “But after that, I thought we got going.”
Donato’s son gave Harvard its first and final lead of the game at 16:29 in the first period. After junior Tyler Moy drove towards the net and flicked a backhander off Ernst’s right pads, Ryan Donato corralled the drifting puck a few feet beyond the goal line to Ernst’s right. With the goaltender having drifted to the outer edge of the crease to make the initial save on Moy, the coach’s son banked a shot off Ernst’s pads and into the back of the net.
“I think guys that think about shooting all the time sometimes get those bounces,” Ted Donato said. “But they put pucks on net…. It was certainly fortunate, but it was a pretty smart play and a big goal for us.”


Brown was the first team to find the scoreboard. Less than three minutes into the game, sophomore defenseman Josh McArdle sent a pass from the Bears face-off circle to a streaking Tim Lappin at the blue line, who was able to break through defensemen Victor Newell and Jacob Olson and beat freshman goaltender Lackey blocker-side just inside the far post with a weak wrister.
Vesey soon quelled any early concerns Harvard may have had. A minute after a hit from behind call sent sophomore Phil Zielonka to the box, the Charlestown native pickpocketed Brown defenseman Max Gottlieb at Harvard’s blue line, leaving only ice between him and junior goaltender Tim Ernst. The Hobey Baker finalist patiently glided to the net and deked left before dragging it back across his body and flicking a backhander top-shelf for the team’s first shorthanded tally of the young season.
“Obviously he made a great play to pick that puck off,” co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “It seemed like [Ernst] was in the bleachers when Jimmy made that backhander.”
Vesey followed up his first goal with another midway through the second period to extend the team’s lead to 3-1. A mishmash of passes among the Walter Brown winner, fellow co-captain Kyle Criscuolo, and junior Alexander Kerfoot down the middle of the ice on a 3-on-2 left the senior with the puck just above the crease where he sent a backhander five-hole, eliciting cheers of “Hobey” from the Harvard student section.
That goal proved to the game-winner, as Brown cut the lead down to one early into the third frame. Fourth-liner Zack Pryzbek fired the puck from the left faceoff circle into the chest of Lackey, who was unable to collect the rebound as Pryzbek followed his shot and lifted a wrister over the rookie’s left pad. Criscuolo would add his third goal of the season with seven minutes left in the contest to increase the cushion for the Crimson, as would Donato with an empty-netter to seal the deal.
While the Crimson offense leads the conference in goals per game, questions still remain concerning the defensive unit, specifically who will occupy the crease going forward. After sophomore Merrick Madsen saved 43 of 45 shots opening weekend against Dartmouth, Ted Donato elected to switch things up in net, sending in Lackey for the Yale and Brown games, in which the rookie saved 54 of 58 shots.

College rankings: we’ve all seen ‘em. More specifically, we’ve all had to listen to that annoying kid in high school complaining about how school rankings are arbitrary and don’t really mean anything. He’s probably not wrong, but is it so horrible to feel a twinge of school pride when you see the big H sitting up at #1? And doesn’t it feel even better to occasionally see our favorite Connecticut safety school slide down a few places? More room to cushion the blow of our soon-to-be-9th consecutive victory.
Unfortunately for our good friends in New Haven, The Economist recently published a ranking of colleges based on how alumni over or underperformed expectations of earning potential, and Yale did not fare so well.
Harvard clocked in at a solid #4: 10 years after they kiss Cambridge goodbye, alumni earn a median of $87,200, exceeding expectations by just shy of 13 grand. Feel free to tell your friends going into finance– they are doing something good for the world. You know, if by that you mean helping Harvard do well in college rankings.
If you’re looking at the online page of rankings on the Economist’s website, you may be confused at first. Sure, Harvard’s at #4, but skimming down the first page there’s no sign of Yale anywhere. That’s right. You’ll have to click through 64 pages of schools before you’ll find any mention of the Bulldogs. (Or you could just skip to the last page, but where’s the fun in that?)
Yep, Yale placed an unfortunate 1270th out of 1275 schools that the Economist ranked. Alumni undershot expected earnings by almost $10,000, or the equivalent of about 1/7 of a year at Yale. Oof.

As years pass by, some things about Harvard that we grew to not hate change. The Game will start later this year, study cards finally could be submitted online and quite possibly soon, Gen Eds will be revamped. People often say that you don’t miss a thing until it’s gone, so we might have a lot of waiting to do. Despite it all, there are many important skills that Gen Eds have given to us. Thus, it seems like an apt time to recount how this beloved system has aided us in our growth as students and responsible adults.
Culture and Belief
Used when you need to see what are the origins of a mysterious new food item in the dining hall are– especially when the dining hall forgets to label it. Was the green sauce actually curry (Indian) or pesto (Italian)? Was HUDS trying to make a statement about globalization if the sauce tasted like both?
Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning
Used when you had to calculate how much space you had in your closet to temporarily stow trash when the parents showed up. Also used when calculating how to space out your BoardPlus budget for the rest of the semester. Sometimes, we like to use the formula (how many nights we’ll be likely to stay up late studying this month) x (the price of a box of sushi at Lamont or mozzarella sticks from Quincy Grille).
Science of the Physical Universe
Used when convincing yourself to stay in bed instead of going to Monday morning lecture. Or Monday afternoon section. Or even Tuesday morning lab. An object at rest tends to stay at rest– you were just following the rules you learned from physics.
Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding
Used when deciding what that text from that cute person in section really meant. Did they only want to watch an educational movie from Netflix at Lamont or watch it together in someone’s common room? Reading between the lines definitely took a serious amount of interpretation and artistic judgment, especially when figuring out what their text punctuation really meant.
Ethical Reasoning
Used when determining if it was right to go to an event just for the food. Maybe you’re a Humanities concentrator who went to a Computer Science job fair that had free Shake Shack. You were doing right by treating yourself, and besides, it's always possible that you might switch concentrations.
Science of Living Systems
Used when cleaning out the common room’s fridge and determining if any surprise living ecosystems were present there. Very important when deciphering whether your roommate’s leftover takeout was still safe for human consumption. If it was, it might have also been necessary to use ethical reasoning to decide whether you should still eat it. A liberal arts education at its best.
In more ways than we can count, Gen Eds have helped us mature as students and individuals. It’s safe to say that each of the categories will be missed in its own way. Oh wait, we’ve forgotten Societies of the World and United States in the World. I guess we'll just have to push them to senior spring.
