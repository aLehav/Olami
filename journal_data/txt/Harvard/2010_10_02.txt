After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Crimson fans have a busy weekend, with many games happening at home and on the road.
The men’s soccer squad faces off against Yale at home in a conference match tomorrow afternoon. Currently, the Crimson stands at 2-3-3, but the team is winless in its last six games. The last two wins Harvard pulled out came in its opening matches against Stanford and Massachusetts. But the Bulldogs are 1-7-1 this season, and the last meeting between the rivals saw the Crimson taking the match in double overtime, 1-0.
The women’s soccer team also takes on Yale at home tomorrow. The squad is looking for its first conference win after losing to Penn in its first and only Ivy matchup. Currently, the women stand at 3-4-1, but they won their last match against Massachusetts, 3-2. As for its rivalry with the Bulldogs, Harvard has won the last two meetings, including a 3-2 victory at Yale last season.
The men’s tennis team takes on competition at the Chowder Fest today, tomorrow, and Sunday. The men started off the season successfully at the Northeast Invitational in Flushing Meadows, N.Y. at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The women’s tennis squad heads to Los Angeles, Calif. for the Riviera/ITA Women’s All-American Championships tomorrow.
And if the home games for soccer and tennis aren’t enough for Crimson fans, the men’s water polo team is taking on MIT tomorrow afternoon. Last weekend, Harvard lost to both Fordham and Iona, 13-5 and 11-10, respectively. The latter match went into four overtime periods, with junior Alex Popp making 21 saves and scoring a goal 30 meters away from the net. Overall, the Crimson stands at 5-10 against the Engineers, with MIT having won the last three out of four meeting between the two teams.
As for away games, the cross-country team heads to the Wisconsin Inter-Regional Invitational tomorrow morning. Both the men and the women finished second last weekend, with the men losing a tight battle to Yale and the women falling to Princeton. Captain Dan Chenoweth took the 8K title last weekend, finishing with a time of 25:10.70.
The football squad also hits the road for the second week in a row and heads to Lafayette. Last weekend, the Crimson fell to Brown, 29-14, to drop to 1-1 on the season. In the history of the two team’s matchups, Harvard has won 11 of the 15 meetings, but Lafayette stopped the Crimson’s eight-game winning streak in the series last season with a 35-18 win.
The women’s volleyball team has found life again. Currently 3-10 on the season, the women broke a seven-game losing streak last weekend with a 3-2 win over New Hampshire. The team takes on Dartmouth tonight at home, taking on its first home conference match. This is the second time that the Crimson faces the Big Green this season. Dartmouth beat Harvard, 3-1, last week.
Like the women’s volleyball team, the field hockey squad has also turned its season around. The team currently stands at 3-5, but the women snapped a five-game losing streak last weekend, beating Penn, 2-0. The team faces Brown tomorrow and Bucknell on Sunday.

Harvard likes the wicked smart kids, but it likes them more when they’re happy and healthy. With the new school year well underway (and midterms slowly creeping up) you may start to feel overwhelmed.
In lieu of the recent Rutgers tragedy, we wanted to point out some resources you can turn to if you’re depressed, looking for someone to talk to, or just want some cool advice on tackling tests or time management.
The Bureau of Study Counsel offers both personal and academic counseling, tutors (Harvard will split the cost for the first ten hours), and a sweet database of tips and tricks to tackle school and student life.
Harvard Health Services offers an assortment of support groups, peer counseling, and mental health services.  Particularly if you’re struggling with a mental health emergency, alcohol or drug issues, or need other intensive counseling or assistance, Health Services is a good resource to turn to.
Mental Health Services—where you can receive consultations, assessments, and medication management—is covered by UHS insurance.
But if you feel more comfortable talking to your peers, Harvard has an abundance of student run counseling groups. Room 13 is confidential and aims to maintain a “supportive and sympathetic ear” where you can talk about anything on your mind in a non-judgmental environment. It’s open seven nights a week from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. in the basement of Thayer.
Other groups include Echo and the PCC.
If you need a place to realign your Chi, the Center for Wellness is a new addition to UHS that provides yoga workshops, massages, and acupuncture to help melt that stress away.
Or you can take advantage of one of the many meditation groups that meet every week on Harvard’s campus.
Whatever your worries, Harvard is here to help. Watch out for those you think may need help (you can refer a fellow student if you’re concerned), and lets ensure that everyone has an enjoyable college experience.

Insult comic Gregory C. Giraldo, Harvard Law ’90, died on Wednesday at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. at the age of 44, according to the New York Times.
Giraldo had been in the hospital since last Saturday night after he was found unconscious in his hotel room in New Brunswick. Citing the New Brunswick police, the Home News Tribune of East Brunswick reported that he had suffered from a drug overdose. His family has declined to release the cause of death.
Giraldo was primarily known for his scathing, rant-filled humor. He was successful as a standup comedian. He toured the country and made appearances on talk shows, such as “The Late Show with David Letterman” and the “Late Night with Conan O’Brien.” However, it was his returning role on Comedy Central’s “Roast” series that drew much of his acclaim. Given his penchant for insult humor, the role was a perfect fit as he lampooned celebrities such as Pamela Anderson, David Hasselhoff, and William Shatner.
Despite his image as a brutal humorist, Giraldo practiced as a lawyer before giving up the profession completely and turning to comedy.

 Hankering for a taste of home? Even if home is halfway around the  world, you might be able to bite into your favorite regional specialty  right here in Cambridge at the All Star Sandwich Bar this month.
 All Star, an Inman Square restaurant boasting all sorts of sandwiches,  is serving its own renditions of street foods from around the world  through the end of October.
 Right now, visitors to this cozy shop can try a lamb gyro based on the  Greek standby; carne asada, a marinated steak sandwich imported from  Mexico; vinha d’alhoes, a Portuguese braised pork creation; a Caprese  sandwich made with ingredients like tomatoes, mozzarella cheese,  avocado, and basil pesto plucked from the Italian salad; and the diego  maradona, an Argentinian sandwich featuring chimichurri chicken salad.   The street food promotion started three and a half weeks ago and has  already featured sandwiches ranging from a French croque-monsieur to a  Korean barbecue dish called kalbi.  Until the end of the month,  Executive Chef John Diamantopoulos will introduce four to five new  street food specials each week.
 “Street food is such a nostalgic item,” said Kosta Diamantopoulos,  owner of the restaurant and brother of the head chef. “We’re bringing  ‘home,’ for a lot of people, to Cambridge.”
 All Star always sells “cool, interesting, famous, fun sandwiches from  across the world,” but according to Kosta (who was wearing a  SANDWICHMANIA shirt), the street foods are different from the “entrees  in the form of a sandwich” that the restaurant sells year-round.
 A Flyby correspondent had the chance to sample three of the standard  menu items—the muffuletta, a New Orleans favorite packed with cold cuts,  roasted peppers, and tangy olive tapenade; the barbecue pulled pork  sandwich, which, Kosta pointed out proudly, offered a pleasing contrast  between its incredibly tender meat and crunchy cole slaw; and the  Rachel, a turkey, Swiss, and slaw delight with Russian dressing dripping  out from between two beautifully grilled pieces of sourdough bread. It  was a feast made in sandwich heaven.
 By making a 20 minute trek straight down Cambridge Street from the  Yard, or hopping on the 69 bus from Harvard Square, you too can get a  taste of almost any corner of the world.  And if you don’t see your  favorite sandwich on the menu, you can request it—just scrawl the  sandwich of your dreams into one of the journals near the door.  Many  customers have already filled the pages with diagrams, recipes, and even  poetic odes to their favorite sandwiches; Kosta assured me that he  reads every entry and might even add your sandwich to the menu and name  it after you. We can’t think of a higher honor.
 A final tip—don’t miss the free Oreos as you leave.  They’re Double Stuf.
