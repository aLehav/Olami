After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lorde’s highly anticipated sophomore album “Melodrama” starts as a relentless pursuit of distraction through wild nights, set to synthesizers and deft beats. While its upbeat songs are full of energy and the perfect pop anthems for a night out, they don’t fool anybody. The album takes place after the party, when the fun is over, and its topics are the bitterness and loneliness of lost love. “Melodrama” is above all a breakup album of the best kind, one that encapsulates the infatuation of love as well as the mascara-tainted tears of heartache and emptiness. Less idiosyncratic than her first effort “Pure Heroine,” which embodied the voice of outsider youths looking into a foreign world of glamour, “Melodrama” is equal to if not better than its predecessor. Its painfully relatable, sophisticated lyrics and distinctive electronic sound are sure to make it an instant hit.
Lead single “Green Light” opens the album with a confident declaration of being over a broken relationship. But its bravado is quick to falter in “Sober,” which starts by bringing alive the initial moments of ecstasy in a relationship with an eclectic background of reggae-inspired beats and soft cries. The lyrics speak to the blinding power of infatuation, one that is so powerful that pills cannot top its high. But the chorus reminds us that despite our attempts to drown out the truth, reality returns after the rush (“Jack and Jill get f****d up and possessive / When it get dark,” she whispers, almost as if to hide the truth from herself). This theme of excessive and reckless love recurs in “The Louvre,” which has a guitar riff in its background and an unexpected chorus that feels almost like a spoken voiceover. While “Sober” hints at the darkness of love, “The Louvre” seems to take a more humorous, mocking view of its all-consuming effects with verses such as: “They'll hang us in the Louvre / Down the back, but who cares—still the Louvre.”
Of all the songs on the new record, “Homemade Dynamite” stylistically shares the most with her last album. Lorde peppers the synth-heavy song with her familiar touches of accelerated lines and falsetto choruses. At this point, we are at the height of the party, the lyrics painting a scene of dancing, drinks, and revelry. In short, this song will be sure to be overplayed on the radio in a few months.
The album reaches its emotional peak in “Hard Feelings/Loveless,” which has divergent parts. The first is concerned with the end of a relationship and the broken pieces left. The verses are sung in a high-pitched voice, perfectly coupled with metallic sounds and screeches in the background reminiscent of malfunctioning vehicles and car crashes. This eventually transforms into a livelier second part about the hostility that replaces love. Compared to the first, this part of the track is much more bubbly. These lyrics are riddled with Lorde’s signature humor and sung with an ironic sweetness that perfectly evokes the spirit of the stereotypical crazy ex-lover: “'Cause I’m gonna mess your life up / Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut / Look out, lovers.” That same humorous tone is also found in “Writer in the Dark”, which does not hold back at all: “I'll love you till my breathing stops / I'll love you till you call the cops on me.” The excess is simply lyrical genius.
“Sober II (Melodrama)” goes straight to the eye of the tornado of an ending relationship, its aftermath filled with violent fights, mistrust, and hopelessness. The exhaustion and sadness in Lorde’s vocals fits wonderfully with the amalgam of violins and electronic beats.
The biggest dance anthems of the album are “Supercut” and the album closer “Perfect Places.” The former focuses on fading memories of a relationship, and the latter leaves us at a party right back where we began. In “Supercuts,” Lorde once again captures those habits so particular to breakups, like the reconstruction of memories the way we wish they had occurred. This song feels more streamlined than the more experimental tracks on the album: It has a strong dance beat familiar to pop music. “Perfect Places” is another likely hit, featuring a catchy electronic tune accompanying its soft melancholy. The lyrics to both songs are poignant, sure to defy any critics who find pop music meaningless.
Anchoring all of this is “Liability,” a song touching on the alienating nature of fame and loneliness. It is stripped down of any music except a piano, using simple but harrowing chords which is perhaps what makes it so heartbreaking. The fragility in the lyrics and vocals means listeners do not have to be famous to relate (“He don't wanna know me / Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm / Says it was poison”).
“Melodrama” triumphs in its ability to capture all the different facets of love and its consequent heartbreak. Each song explores these feelings in a tender way, slowly peeling back the layers of boozy nights until we are confronted with truth and raw emotion. Lorde (whose real name is Ella Yelich-O'Connor) and her primary collaborator Jack Antonoff should congratulate themselves on creating an album that is likely not only to prove successful commercially but also to remain in its listeners’ hearts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Your sister and her friends hotboxed a car in an elementary school parking lot, and when a cop came, he wished her a safe ride home! Imagine what would happen if I were in that situation! The resolution that the War on Drugs is unfair clearly stands.” Yield remaining time to the chair. Let my closing statement hang in the air as my predominantly white blockmates and fellow debaters silently mull and accept the rhetorical weight of my statement, my identity, my blackness.
Finally, dab three times in celebration.
The phrases “respect my experience,” and the related “check your privilege,” urge others to consider how their biases may affect their positions and the debate itself, often to great rhetorical effect. But not having the experiences most associated with my race complicates my use of those phrases. I’ve never interacted with the police. I’ve had the fortune of having attended two esteemed academic institutions since the seventh grade. I’ve never been the direct target of racist speech or violence.
As a result, I feel a little disingenuous for appealing to experiences associated with blackness that I don’t have. Make no mistake, I’m not wishing for those experiences in order to validate my identity or to gain “black cred.” Rather, due to my race, people wrongly assume that I have had certain experiences, an impression that I can use for rhetorical effect. My identity doesn’t make good rhetorical fodder. Yet, my “identity” does.
Moreover, those phrases can be argumenta ad auctoritatem et ad hominem—arguments whose rhetorical force stem from unfairly evaluating the speaker instead of their speech—so why bother using them? Their use seemingly goes against the fair debate, where the “rules of debate” are strictly and universally enforced so that an argument’s strength is evaluated independent of its speaker.
Years of classical education and debating have taught me that the “ideal debate” is one where personal experience is kept to a minimum and the winner is he who presents the most objective evidence the most strongly—presumably in Greek. Although political discourse doesn’t take place in that sterile world of logic driven debate (read: a high school debate class), we still try to appeal to those “rules of debate” when we feel like some sense of civility, fairness, or respect has been violated.
Yet appeals to those rules can themselves be unfair, especially when applied unequally. Consider the name-dropping of black orators and appeals to debate etiquette to silence a political position under the guise of attacking its presentation. From Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King Jr., black orators have been something of a fixture in the American political consciousness, partially due to their triumph over academic, racial, and sociopolitical barriers to be considered worthy of participating in national discourse.
Yet their inspiring example is used to establish a “you-must-be-this-respectable” bar to even participate in discourse, a restriction which disproportionately limits who debates and what positions are present. The pursuit of my “ideal debate,” in practice, often perverts the fairness those norms try to uphold and even reinstates those same barriers to exclude the marginalized from discourse.
The usual reward for managing to enter the debate while black despite those barriers is being called “articulate.” Although well-meaning, this compliment can be particularly loaded for black people because it can be both demeaning (articulate, compared to the stereotypical black person) and patronizing (articulate, i.e. simply speaking with proper and somewhat formal grammar). Put another way, being “articulate” is often synonymous with “sounding white,” something I have also been accused of over the years.
I heard more of those comments as I entered high school, and continue to do so today. “Sounding white,” in a twisted way, was acknowledgement that I gained some understanding of the “rules of debate,” and was worthy to participate. But this is actually a reflection of education—a privilege paid for by my parents—more than skill.
Some of the most powerful pieces on race I’ve encountered were written from personal experience more than objective data. Yet they would probably be dismissed for being too emotional, while my writing would be accepted, especially given the proper Latin translation of two logical fallacies above. Being articulate can be often enough to warrant a position as “the token black debater,” whose agreement can be used to validate another’s opinion on racial issues, but whose lone presence alludes to the still excluded.
My racial identity is defined by neither black marginalization nor black triumph. Rather, it’s more defined by that interplay of privilege and tokenism, being in the simultaneously empowering and other-izing position of “speaker for your race.” I can’t fully determine the fairness of asking others to “respect my experience” without knowing what my experience means to me. But I can recognize that the rules of debate aren’t as objective and fair in practice as they are idealized.
While my privilege has established me as the representative of the marginalized, the self-declared arbiters of the “ideal debate” often reject those individuals’ experiences and arguments for being “unobjective evidence” or “uncivilly presented.” Maybe it’s for the best that I use fallacious rhetoric in addition to logical arguments to more forcefully debate our shared opinions in their absence.
Maybe those rules should be bent in the name of that same fairness.

Sections
In the second installment of Flyby’s response to “oh my gosh, what on earth can I do this summer,” we’re bringing you suggestions for destinations inside and out of Cambridge. Take a tour, buy a little something for yourself, and maybe even pick up a cheap summer read. (See part one on outdoor activities and part three on shows around town.)
Explore a nearby museum
This summer, take advantage of the free admittance privileges extended to Harvard students at many nearby museums. Peruse Harvard’s own art or natural history museums, or journey into Boston to visit the Museum of Fine Art, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, or the Institute of Contemporary Art.
(MFA: Red Line to Green Line to Museum of Fine Arts. Gardner: Red Line to Green Line to Longwood. ICA: Red Line to South Station.)
Get a tour of the Taza Chocolate Factory
When you see “Taza,” you might immediately think, “too expensive.” You’re right—$7.50 for a chocolate bar is questionable at best. However, a tour of the Taza factory in Somerville will only cost you 50 cents more! Finally you can realize your childhood “Willy Wonka” dream, and get some good chocolate samples in the bargain.
Visit the Aquarium
The New England Aquarium is not cheap (adult tickets are $27.95, to be exact), but the good news is that college students can get in for a whole $2 less than everybody else! Those penguins and clown fish better brace themselves—we’re coming. If nothing else, a trip to the aquarium is a good excuse to get out of Cambridge and enjoy a day by the water at the wharf.
(Red Line to Downtown Crossing.)
Stop by a Cambridge market
If you’re looking to chow down on some food (who isn’t?) or support local artists, stop by any of the open air markets in the Cambridge area this summer. On Tuesdays, Harvard Square is home to its own farmer’s market on the Science Center Plaza, but if you’re looking to mix it up, don’t miss the open market scene in Central Square on Mondays or Kendall Square on Thursdays.
Journey to a Boston market
Feeling adventurous? Take the Red Line to the South End any weekend for the SoWa Open Market—home to food trucks, a farmer’s market, an arts market, and a super cool vintage market. You can also head to Copley Square for an open market on Tuesdays and Fridays to get your hands on some local products that we’re sure you’ll enjoy.
(SoWa Open Market: Red Line to Broadway. Copley Square Market: Red Line to Green Line to Copley.)
Shop on “Fiction Fridays” at the Harvard Bookstore
Jump start your summer reading quest with some purchases at Harvard Bookstore. Every Friday this summer, they are offering 15% off of fiction, mystery, science fiction, mythology, poetry, and graphic novels. With a deal like that, who could resist making a few impulse buys?
Hang out at the Cambridge Public Library
