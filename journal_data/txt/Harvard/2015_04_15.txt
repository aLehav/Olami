After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The idea that the various characters who surround Hamlet serve primarily to illuminate aspects of his own character is not a novel proposition. Unlike other theories of the play, such as, say, its Freudian or feminist interpretations, this concept pertains far more directly to “Hamlet” as text than to “Hamlet” as theater, and it rarely manifests in performance. It was decidedly ambitious, then, for director Lelaina E. Vogel ’15 to cast a “Hamlet” without Hamlet, a version of the play in which the protagonist’s lines were dispersed among the other actors, who changed into black costumes to identify themselves as the current Prince of Denmark. Fortunately, the theory on which Vogel bases her direction was a valuable one, a compelling idea that, when performed, cast a familiar play in a novel and intriguing light. Despite some missteps in the execution of this fundamental inspiration, stellar acting and a unique premise worked together to create a show that was more than worthwhile.
Vogel’s “Hamlet,” which ran April 3-11 on the Loeb Mainstage, certainly took a risk. It divested the play of its core virtue: the character of Hamlet himself. In doing so, however, Vogel dispersed those affecting elements of Hamlet’s character among the play’s other characters, making them far more developed and intriguing in the process. Emilie G.C. Thompson ’16, an inactive Arts editor who plays Gertrude for the majority of the play, delivered the soliloquy wherein Hamlet condemned his mother and wished that his religious views permitted him to take his own life. The idea that Gertrude herself might have asserted, “Frailty, thy name is woman!” provided depth to an oft-neglected character. Similarly, the choice to have Horatio (Matthew B. Barrieau ’16) perform the “To be or not to be” soliloquy illuminated his profound sadness in the wake of Hamlet’s death. At other points, this reapportioning of Hamlet’s lines gave insight into Hamlet himself. In one of the performance’s most clever moments, Gertrude and Laertes (Matt J. Ciommo ’15) fought for the role of Hamlet while performing “O what a rogue and peasant slave am I,” a directorial choice that created an affecting manifestation of the self-hatred that characterized the soliloquy.
Unfortunately, the enormous potential of the performance’s premise went unused more often than not. Frequently, the assignment of Hamlet to one actor or another seemed made for reasons of logistics—for example, Laertes, quite an obvious foil for Hamlet, spoke the balance of Hamlet’s lines simply because he was away in France for the majority of the play. After Ophelia (Juliana N. Sass ’17) died, she took on Hamlet’s role for the show’s remainder. Such choices seemed lazy rather than thought out, and they thus made poor use of the opportunity to develop the play’s secondary characters. Claudius (Anthony Amoroso), for example, rarely played Hamlet, though granting him the role for the pivotal scene in Gertrude’s bedroom could have deepened his character substantially.
Ultimately, however, the show’s spectacular cast lessened the prominence of these missteps and brought its virtues into greater relief. Even though Claudius gained little from the performance’s premise, Amoroso’s portrayal of him was so pitch perfect that he was nevertheless an effective character. Though Laertes had more than his fair share of Hamlet’s lines, he never quite overstayed his welcome thanks to Ciommo’s masterful delivery of Hamlet’s lies of feigned madness. And, though Ophelia was only given the chance to become Hamlet postmortem, Sass’s nuanced and eminently believable acting ensured that she was compelling before her death.
Perhaps, then, despite the novelty of the show’s premise, its success was based on elements it might have shared with any other production. Certainly, the trappings and accoutrements of a show are significant, but, in the case of “Hamlet,” it was the cast who ultimately made the performance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It is estimated that one in five women on college campuses has been sexually assaulted during their time there—one in five.” — President Barack Obama
Last week, one of us had lunch with a colleague who adamantly rejected these numbers. He argued that the surveys that yielded these results are methodologically flawed. He believes that politicians and pundits are extrapolating a national trend (“one in five” women experiencing an attempted or completed sexual assault while at college) from a handful of potentially misleading studies. He also noted that we don’t have data from Harvard students.
During the last year, we’ve heard a lot of people critique the one in five number. Many students and faculty have told us that the true prevalence is much lower. Many other students and faculty have told us that the true prevalence is much higher. One fraternity member from a peer university told us that well over a third of female university students experience an attempted or completed sexual assault during a four-year degree program.
This wide range of strongly expressed opinions is facilitated by inconclusive survey evidence. And so we are left with serious questions. Is the true prevalence of sexual assault less than or greater than one in five?  And how does the national prevalence rate compare to prevalence at Harvard? To answer these questions reliably, we need much more high-quality data, especially surveys in which the vast majority of those invited participate in the survey.
And this is where you can help. This month, 28 research universities with a total population of more than 800,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students will conduct a new Sexual Conduct Survey. Harvard is one of those schools. At Harvard, all degree-seeking students will be surveyed, comprising 20,000 students at Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the nine professional schools.
This new Sexual Conduct Survey creates an opportunity to significantly advance the national debate about the prevalence and nature of sexual assault. The survey will also measure other forms of sexual harassment, data that has not been collected extensively at Harvard before.
This survey is important for many reasons, but four stand out in our minds.
First, each university needs a 2015 baseline measurement of the prevalence of sexual assault and other kinds of sexual harassment on their campus. As new policies come on line and as social norms evolve, we need to know whether the prevalence of sexual assault and sexual harassment is falling (or rising) relative to that baseline.
Second, the survey will reveal variation in the prevalence of sexual assault across universities. As we reevaluate our own policies, we should study the policies and practices of the universities with the lowest rates of sexual assault. Of course, we can also glean valuable lessons from studying universities with the highest rates of sexual assault.
Third, the survey will identify risk factors—for instance, alcohol and other drugs that lead to incapacitation—that will help universities design better policies. Understanding the myriad risk factors will help Harvard and other universities improve their educational outreach programs and interventions targeted at sexual assault, such as bystander intervention training.
Fourth, the survey will help us measure satisfaction and dissatisfaction with Harvard’s specific reporting and support structures for students who have experienced sexual assault. Are these organizations working well? Have students even heard of them?
On Sunday, Harvard students received an email from Westat, a survey research organization, inviting you to participate in the Sexual Conduct Survey. (If you didn’t get it, please check your spam filter.) Having Westat—which is external to Harvard—conduct the survey assures confidentiality. Harvard will never receive any student identifiers from Westat, and even the records that Westat itself keeps are stripped of all identifiers. Using a common survey across 28 schools also assures comparability. We’ll learn much more because Westat is asking the same questions in the same way across the 28 campuses.
The success of this survey is in your hands. Please respond to the Westat invitation by taking the survey, regardless of whether you think the issue of sexual assault is directly relevant to you. The purpose of this survey is to gather information about the student population as a whole, not about a particular sub-population. Because of the responses that you and your peers provide, we’ll be able to significantly advance what we know about sexual assault and other kinds of sexual harassment.  The results generated from this survey will influence university and national policy decisions for decades to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My downward spiral began the summer between fifth and sixth grade.
Middle school was bad. That is a non-revolutionary, non-polarizing statement.
This next part is a confession.
Mom. Dad. I used to be very, very active on the popular online question and answer forum, Yahoo! Answers. Or Y!A, as we hip 2005 tweens called it.
For those of you who played sports or learned skills or had friends in 2005, Yahoo! Answers is essentially a website for googling things in a far less efficient way, such that instead of your query returning a paginated list of helpful websites and articles, a few dozen children using their family’s desktop computers answer (or, more likely, wildly guess at an answer to) your question.
I was a huge smartass when I was a kid. And, to make things worse, I was smart. I knew I was smart. Everyone around me was always telling me I was smart. Even that totally smoking hot student-teacher in the fifth grade that all the boys in my class made gross jokes about. Wait, what! I wasn’t gay! Gross!
And so began my long career on Yahoo! Answers.
I’m twelve and I’m sitting at my peace-sign decorated desk, typing away on my navy blue Dell laptop, eating a Burger King double cheese burger and fries, diving deeper and deeper into that series box set of the cinematic masterpiece/mediocre soap opera, The O.C., that I got for Christmas that one year and totally didn’t watch exclusively for the season where Marissa is super in love with her rebellious lady-friend whose name I don’t remember but it doesn’t matter because I totally wasn’t gay! Gross!
I’d take breaks between episodes to answer questions on Yahoo! Answers.
I was miserable. I totally hated myself, as too many queer kids often do. (See also: fat kids, black kids, etc., etc.) I was self-conscious. I channeled this Burger King-fueled self-loathing into being an incredibly inflammatory member of the Yahoo! Answers community. (And let me tell you, it was a community. Y!A means family, and family means I’ll give you a best answer if you give me a best answer.)
Most of the time, this purposeful inflammatory-ness manifested itself in me bullying fans of the popular 2000s boy band, The Jonas Brothers. I didn’t even dislike the Jonas Brothers that much. I mean if you don’t think  “The Year 3000” is a total banger, you’re clearly lying to yourself.
But I knew that these people really, really cared about The Jonas Brothers. The band meant everything to them. Or, at the very least, they just wanted to start a conversation about them.
Their passion irritated me. I was more enlightened than they were! How could I go on living in such an otherworldly plain of transcendent intelligence and opinion while allowing them to keep being so average. I was helping them, really. By being inflammatory on purpose. And occasionally using the word “gay” as an insult. Or by making fun of Jonas Brothers fans for being “little girls.” It totally had nothing to do with my messed up sense of self! I knew that what I was saying could be hurtful, but that wasn’t the intention, so so what! I just wanted to push everyone forward by subjecting them to my purposefully hurtful responses to things.
And if anyone got offended, I pulled the free speech card. I had learned enough in social studies to do that.
I think of my 11-year-old self, sitting at my desk, typing away at my computer whenever I see those people whose entire internet presence—or worse, real-life presence—is dedicated to undermining others and their genuine beliefs by commenting on every social justice issue or article or admittedly leftist opinion with their own often made-up, satirical, parodying, opinions and comments.
It’s the self-conscious superiority complex that calls social justice activists over-sensitive or racist-against-white-people, and stigmatizes the term “social justice warrior.” It’s the same pretention that coined the term “feminazi.” It’s the relentless and incendiary wit that misgenders someone “for the sake of grammar.” It’s the same “freedom-o’-speech” that put up those deliberately harmful and misleading posters against the new POC art collective on campus, Renegade, and the same proud stubbornness that calls posing as a group and stealing their voice to speak with prejudiced, offensive, and oh-so-fetchingly-inflammatory statements in the homes of many POC students and members of the collective, “satire.” It’s Nancy Grace, but with less fabulous hair.
I get it. Being a walking satire is in vogue right now. Look at you. You’re so next-level. Just like 2005 Y!A me. But speech comes with the expectation of being held accountable for what you contribute to a space. And it should come with respect for your community, be it Harvard’s campus or Yahoo! Answers. Which is to say: my dad drives a school bus, and every year he posts a sign in the bus that says, “Do not speak unless your speech improves the silence.” My dad is the smartest guy I know, and one of the quietest. So.
I think being genuine is the best way to go, and I think it is forgotten that satire and parody should and are supposed to be used to challenge and push mechanisms of power, and to give a voice to, or at least avoid trampling on, the marginalized.  (i.e. Why’s the person in section bravely “playing the devil’s advocate” always that white boy who’s always talking anyway?) And I know that soon we will all have been raised by the Internet, and my inflammatory phase is already immortalized under a Yahoo! Answers username that I will not tell you—
And I do think, and sincerely hope, that everyone will eventually grow up. Just like I did.

Harvard College’s new Honor Council, due to begin operating next fall, represents a significant improvement over the Administrative Board in terms of transparency, communication between the adjudicatory body and students, and emphasis on student involvement. Operating in tandem with the Ad Board, the Honor Council will improve the College's handling of integrity cases. In particular, the inclusion of Student Academic Integrity Fellows is an impressive feature of the council’s structure. That said, the Council has to ensure that it makes good on its promises of transparency in the coming years.
Students have long called for peer representation on the College’s primary judiciary board, and as half of the Honor Council's case-hearing members will be undergraduates, this new body will be fulfilling a much-needed and much-awaited wish. In addition, the new process will be more transparent for the accused: While the Ad Board currently breaks into small subcommittees to interview accused students, the Honor Council will meet with students in larger eight-person groups. According to Associate Dean for Academic Integrity and Student Conduct Brett Flehinger, future secretary of the Honor Council, every accused student will now have the chance to meet with everyone deciding his or her case.
The SAIFs will also play a worthwhile role by representing the interests of students and by ensuring communication between the Council and students. In addition to four students and four faculty or staff on the Honor Council, a SAIF will accompany students undergoing academic integrity evaluations, working to help them understand how the Honor Council process works. Besides serving as representatives from the administration, SAIFs will also be points of contact for students who have been asked to withdraw.
This peer support system, in addition to the public, transparent nature of the Honor Council’s development thus far, provides a stark contrast to what we have in the past called the Ad Board’s “central lack of transparency.”
“One thing that has distinguished this process is that it has been so visible,” said SAIF Palmer Smith ’16. “We wanted strong community engagement throughout this process, and the SAIFs are going to play a big role in that.”
This “community engagement” will also be key to making students feel personally responsible for academic integrity.
“Given the important role our students play in [the Honor Council and crafting the Honor Code], it will probably inspire curiosity around the culture of academic integrity around students,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said. This emphasis on student awareness will be crucial to having students feel like they have a degree of ownership over academic integrity at Harvard.
But while the Honor Council will be more open in many ways than the Ad Board has been, it has not eliminated all the transparency issues that are associated with discipline at Harvard. In particular, the College should begin releasing more detailed statistics on academic integrity violations.  This weakness remains a concern with the Honor Council: When reached for comment about how the Honor Council plans to publish statistics about academic integrity cases, Dean Flehinger said there were no concrete plans in this regard.
“Our connections to the community through case reporting are developing as the members of the Honor Council develop their understanding of the scope of their work and the Honor Code becomes part of our culture,” Dean Flehinger said. “The student members of the Council are just starting, and as all the members of the Council work together, they will guide our efforts to connect to the community as effectively as possible.”
While this perspective reaffirms the Honor Council’s interest in engaging with the community, it does not necessarily solve the procedural transparency issue that has plagued the Ad Board for years. The Honor Council’s inclusion of students represents immense progress, but it must continue working to avoid the pitfalls of its predecessor.

UPDATED: April 14, 2015, at 9:33 p.m. 
The new Economics Question Center, designed to serve as a central hub for tutoring in foundational economics courses, is still ramping up operations after its launch on Sunday.
Modeled in part after the Mathematics Question Center, which offers tutoring for select courses Sunday through Thursday evenings, the EQC will serve as both a resource for students with questions about their problem sets and a place for Economics concentrators to convene, according to the professor and student tutors behind the project.
“One of the main goals…[is to] try to create a central home for the undergraduates in the Economics Department,” concentration adviser Jane L. Herr said. “It’s a big department. Because it’s so big, the student body is much more varied, and I think some students feel like they can get lost.”
Once the EQC is up and running, attending tutoring sessions could become an important part of being an undergraduate in the department, Herr said.
On Sunday night, no students in need of tutoring showed up, according to Herr. And on Monday night around 8 p.m., only three students sat in the Littauer M-42 classroom—all of them student tutors.
“We haven’t had much time to get word around,” tutor Sabrina N. Bukenya ’16 said. “I definitely feel that this could be a great resource for Ec concentrators.”
With the EQC in its early stages, the founders plan to use the remaining portion of the semester to work through potential challenges, Herr said. “We’re aware that we’re starting very late in the semester...with the hope of, next year, that we get a running start at the very beginning of the semester,” she said.
In addition to creating a space for economics concentrators to ask questions and receive help, another motivation for creating the EQC was a shortage of designated economics tutors at the Bureau of Study Counsel, according to tutor Trent A. Nelson ’16, one of the founders of the EQC.
“The impetus for this was because [of] the lack of tutors at the BSC...I think [there’s a need] to reach out directly to those kids who are waiting or who have been wanting tutors,” Nelson said. “Clearly, there’s a demand there.”
Herr also said the BSC provides students with a different kind of tutoring than the type which will occur at the EQC. While the BSC has weekly, one-on-one sessions between students and tutors, the EQC may offer more flexibility to students who may or may not have specific questions on their problem sets, Herr said.
“What’s really nice about the MQC—and what we’re hoping we’re going to create, too—is that this is drop-in, ‘it’s there if I need it,’ kind of environment,” she said.

UPDATED: April 16, 2015, at 2:51 a.m.
Among the familiar sea of acronyms surrounding college admissions―AP, IB, SAT, ACT―a new credential is popping up on applications that Harvard's Admissions Office has not yet decided how heavily to weigh: the MOOC, or massive open online course.
Through HarvardX, the University’s subset of the online learning platform edX, anyone with an internet connection can enroll in virtual courses taught by Harvard faculty on topics ranging from computer science to global health to American poetry. But according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, admissions officers are still trying to figure out how to weigh edX courses against more conventional classes, like Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate, on applicants’ transcripts.
“We don’t have a lot of experience with [students taking edX courses] yet, but it’s one factor among many,” Fitzsimmons said. “Before you start to weigh things heavily in the admissions process, they need to be tested out to see whether there’s actually an effect on student performance [in college].”
Still, Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia who now runs a college consulting business, said he encourages his students to enroll in MOOCs as preparation for the large lecture classes that they might encounter in college.
Muth himself enrolled in a HarvardX course on the ancient Greek hero, but said that he fits the typical profile of MOOC learners―according to a post on the edX blog, 66 percent of edX users already have advanced degrees.
Muth said he believes that fewer high school students enroll in edX courses because, unlike AP and IB courses, they do not reward students with college credit for completion. Muth believes it is unlikely that edX courses will be offered for such credit in the future.
“If people could earn credit for MOOCs, many would earn at least a year or two of credit and stop paying tuition to attend schools for four years,” he said. “If instead of taking APs and paying hundreds of dollars to sit the exam, students could take MOOCs instead, then the College Board would lose millions of dollars.”
Anna Ivey, founder of the college admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting, agreed that edX classes will not be “substituting graded classes any time soon.” However, she added that taking online courses can demonstrate interest and aptitude in a particular discipline.
“If you aren’t at a fancy high school offering lots of high-level coursework, it really is a wonderful alternative for people to have access to rigor in the difficulty of the content that they might not have at their conventional schools,” she said. “There’s certainly no real downside, aside from that students have limited time and bandwidth.”

Campus demonstrations by the environmental activist group Divest Harvard have affected classrooms across Harvard’s campus, with some students missing class to participate and some professors incorporating the demonstrations into their curricula.
Divest Harvard began its blockade of Massachusetts Hall, which houses the offices of University President Drew G. Faust and her senior staff, on Sunday evening, and say that they plan to continue their occupation until Friday, April 17. Some student members of Divest Harvard said that their activities this week, dubbed “Heat Week,” will mean missing classes and fitting their academic work into time between protests.
“I’ve brought some work out here with me to do on the blockade. The bigger challenge is all the time and energy that went into planning, which obviously couldn’t go into academics,” said Jasmine P. Opie ’16, a co-coordinator of Divest Harvard.
Other members of Divest Harvard have found ways to incorporate their activism into their academic work. Divest member Canyon S. Woodward ’15 says that his involvement with the group helped inform his topic choice for his thesis, which focused on the climate movement in the United States over the past 10 years. He added that his thesis research has also helped contextualize his activist work.
“The thesis was the crux of my academic experience, and that research led me to the conclusion that it really will take a grassroots social movement like we’re trying to build here to make an impact,” he said.
For her part, Divest Harvard co-founder and student outreach co-coordinator Chloe S. Maxmin ’15 said, “I see my academics as enhancing my activism and my activism as enhancing my academics. I came here to learn, to be educated, and I’m not forsaking that at all.”
Members of the student group participating in the week’s activities said that their professors have for the most part accepted their reason for missing class this week.
“Generally there’s been a positive reaction. They’re really understanding,” said Opie.
Some faculty members have also incorporated the week’s activities into their teaching. Associate professor of sociology Jocelyn Viterna, who is currently teaching Sociology 27: “Introduction to Social Movements,” said that she brought her Monday lecture to Mass. Hall.
“I walked the class over yesterday to see social mobilization in action. The students involved in ‘Harvard Heat Week’ talked about how they got involved in this issue, and I think it was a powerful learning experience for my students,” Viterna said on Tuesday.
Divinity School lecturer Willa B. Miller, who is currently teaching HDS 3016: “Green Buddhism: Faith, Ecology, and Activism,” said she created an additional final paper option for her class in response to the week’s protest: students will have the choice of attending a “Heat Week” event and writing a reflection on it.
“I know that some of my students were going to attend it anyway, and it seemed like it might dovetail well with their work for the course. And of course it works well because the class is about faith and the earth and activism,” she said.

Adam E. Cohen ’01, a professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and of Physics, uses proteins from the Dead Sea to create visualizations of neural activity and its electrical impulses. He enhances brain cells with these proteins and causes the cells to flash with light.
Cohen has received the 2015 Pure Chemistry award from the American Chemistry Society in recognition of this work on neural imaging, along with related biochemical research that uses light. He is also the winner of various prestigious awards for young scientists, such as the inaugural award of Blavatnik and the 10 most promising young scientists by Popular Science.
Cohen, who has long harbored in interest in brain chemistry and laser experiments, and his group first experimented with proteins of bacteria recovered from the ocean. These ocean-based proteins proved ineffective at facilitating neural imaging. When Cohen’s team searched in the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan, rather than the ocean, they discovered a single-cell organism that had potentially useful genes.
One major challenge of working with neural activities that happen in the span of one thousandth of a second is building a customized optical system, equipped with sufficiently sensitive cameras, he said. After prototyping hardware and developing computer programs, Cohen and and his team extracted the genes and engineered the proteins.
“It’s called protein engineering but that’s a bit of an exaggeration,” Cohen said. “It’s really protein trial and error.”
Throughout the course of a year, Cohen’s group tried 45 different approaches before finding a successful one. Cohen, who was away from campus when his students tried their 46th approach, recalled a middle-of-the-night phone call that alerted him to the good news.
“That was an exciting moment,” he said.
As a next step, Cohen will apply his lighting methods to neurons in the brains of live animals, in addition to neurons grown in dish plates in the lab.

UPDATED: April 16, 2015, at 2:25 a.m.
Two dozen high school seniors from the Boston area gathered in lab in the Science Center Tuesday morning, eagerly donning gloves and goggles as they prepared to perform a three-hour long lab on polymerase chain reactions and gel electrophoresis.
Launched in 2002, the Harvard Life Sciences Outreach Program is composed of a variety of initiatives, including the Spring Student Program, all aimed at providing science-related educational resources to teachers and students alike.
“Our mission is to translate the research that’s happening at Harvard in the life sciences into tangible curriculum for high school students and also professional development for teachers”, said program manager Tara B. Bristow.
Over the year, the teacher program trains almost a hundred instructors, and the student program reaches about 500 high school students. The group reaches an additional four to five thousand students through another program, the Amgen Biotech Experience, according to Bristow, but she said the main purpose of the outreach efforts is not recruitment.
“Really our main goal is to reach students at all different places across Massachusetts and basically New England,” Bristow said. “It’s more about getting students excited about science and then learning about research careers than having a pipeline for students to apply to Harvard.”
According to Alia Y. Qatarneh, a research assistant for the Spring Student Program, many of the classrooms that participate have very little of the resources to run the labs themselves.
“A lot of these teachers come to these things not to get a day off from teaching but because they don’t have the funds to buy pipettes and gel electrophoresis equipment,” Qatarneh said. “Most of the time this is the students’ first experience with either that model organism or that key equipment that is necessary for that lab.”
But even though most classrooms come for only one three-hour lab, Qatarneh notices that many students walk away with greater interest in science.
“For me, the takeaway is when they’re leaving you hear them say ‘That was really cool’, and you know that even though the labs are content-driven, it’s really more about the experience,” Qatarneh said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 16, 2015

On Friday mornings, a group of faculty from across the sciences congregates in the Harvard University Center for the Environment to share pastries, coffee, and the most intriguing findings on microbial topics. These “Friday Chalk-Talk Breakfasts” are just one piece of the multifaceted program that makes up the Microbial Sciences Initiative.
The initiative, an interdepartmental and interschool program founded by Harvard faculty members in 2003, aims to engage more students from the College as well as microbial scientists from the Boston area, according to co-director of MSI and microbiology professor Roberto Kolter.
The science initiative currently involves approximately 100 professors from a variety of departments, including the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Earth and Planetary Sciences departments, as well as Harvard Medical School and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
“Examples of interdisciplinary research projects developed due to the MSI by students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty include the characterization of the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of bacteria associated with cystic fibrosis, addressing questions regarding the origin and evolution of polycyclic lipids,” Colleen Cavanaugh, the other co-director of MSI, wrote in an email.
These research findings are shared at weekly gatherings hosted by MSI, including the Friday Chalk-Talk Breakfasts, and at seminars given on the second Thursday of every month.
In addition to these year-round activities, MSI also hosts a few yearly or seasonal programs.
According to Kolter, MSI holds an annual symposium, in which members of the microbial research community gather to discuss recent findings with the hope of attracting undergraduates both from Harvard and other universities in the area.
“Currently, the Harvard Microbial Research Initiative are only Harvard-affiliated faculty, and undergraduates who apply for summer initiatives are largely Harvard,” said Kolter, “But, any of the events we hold are free and open to the public; faculty and students from MIT, Northeastern all come.”
The MSI annual symposium, which will be held at Radcliffe Gymnasium this Saturday, is open and free to the public.
In another attempt to attract undergraduate students to the study of microbes, MSI’s faculty associates helped to create the secondary field in microbial sciences.
“That secondary field wasn’t as successful,” Kolter said. “Students are probably getting the information from biochemical sciences or other concentrations.”
For this reason, MSI relies heavily on its summer research fellowship to attract undergraduates. The fellowship, available to undergraduates, funds students to work in the labs of MSI affiliates.
“We would love to reach out to more undergraduates,” Kolter said. “That’s why we have the summer training. It’s our most successful way of attracting undergraduates.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent study published in Nature, co-authored by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, found mounting evidence for the role of magnetic fields in star formation. By measuring the orientation of magnetic field lines on a variety of scales in the Cat’s Paw Nebula, scientists found that magnetic field direction is well preserved through different spatial scales.
Stars form within dense regions that exist inside giant molecular clouds. Due to the large mass of the gas molecules, gravity exerts a massive force to pull the particles together, leading to an increase in density and an eventual collapse. The rising temperature that results from the release of gravitational potential energy ends up facilitating fusion of hydrogen atoms into heavier elements within the cloud. This process builds pressure that counteracts the pull of gravity.
“This is how hydrostatic equilibrium state is reached, and that’s what stars are. But once that energy’s out, it could further collapse, leading to neutron stars and black holes,” said T.K. Sridharan, one of the co-authors of the study and associate of the Harvard College Observatory. “So why aren’t they all collapsing?”
Scientists believe that the answer lies in turbulence and magnetic fields. According to Qizhou Zhang, another co-author of the study and an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, turbulence is thermal motion of particles caused by interstellar energy that “cascades down to very small spatial scales in the clouds into dense cores, acting like a pressure to stop gas from actually condensing.”
Magnetic fields, on the other hand, restrict the flow of gas and oppose the cloud’s tendency to collapse.
“Magnetic fields couple with electrons, anything that’s ionized,” said Zhang. “The ions will collide with neutral gas and produce resistance if the gas wants to move across the magnetic field.”
The impact of magnetic fields has been more challenging to assess due to the difficulty of measuring their strength and orientation. However, thanks to the Smithsonian’s Submillimeter Array, a collection of eight radio telescopes located atop Mauna Kea, researchers have been able to detect the direction of magnetic field lines.
“The effect of the turbulence on the magnetic field is to pull it around everywhere and mix it up,” said Sridharan. “If turbulence is very strong, then it will get completely tangled up. If magnetic field is strong, it will maintain its orientation and guide turbulence.”
Using the Submillimeter Array and other facilities, researchers measured the polarization of light emitted by spinning dust particles in dense cores. Polarization reveals the orientation of the dust particles, which in turn is aligned with the orientation of the magnetic field lines.
Since the field orientation was conserved across varying scales in the Cat’s Paw Nebula, it seems that the magnetic field is strong enough to resist being disturbed by turbulence. The study is part of an ongoing effort to determine the impact of magnetic fields on the collapse of molecular clouds to create stars.
“The picture that is emerging is that magnetic fields are playing a very important role in star formation,” Sridharan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has significantly reduced its greenhouse gas emissions, waste, energy, and water use since 2006, according to a new report released by the University’s Office for Sustainability on Tuesday.
The first report since the office set sustainability goals last year, the release highlights the progress the University has made in meeting its reduction targets. Ninety-eight percent of emissions at the University involve heating spaces and providing electricity in buildings, according to the report. University-wide energy use has been reduced 2 percent, when accounting for growth and renovations.
University President Drew G. Faust has pointed to research and teaching as ways that Harvard can contribute to environmental sustainability and reduce fossil fuel dependence and also emphasized sustainability initiatives on Harvard’s campus. Environmental activist group Divest Harvard, which is demanding that the University divest its endowment from fossil fuels, has prevented Faust from entering her office in Massachusetts Hall for two days this week as it carries out a planned blockade of the building.
The report emphasizes sustainable research—which Faust has consistently pointed to as a superior alternative to divestment—pointing to the 239 faculty affiliated with the Harvard Center for the Environment teaching 243 courses on energy, sustainability, or the environment. Harvard has spent $71 million funding sustainable research since 2009, according to the report.
Even while the University has grown over 3 million square feet in new construction and renovation, University-wide greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 21 percent since 2006, nine points below its 30 percent goal by 2016, according to the report.
Jisung Park, a climate change researcher and Eliot House tutor, said Harvard’s greenhouse gas targets are “very ambitious” compared to other universities.
“I see Harvard’s main comparative advantage on two planes: The first is pushing forward the knowledge frontier by engaging in cutting-edge research, and I think Harvard’s track record speaks for itself,” Park said. “The second is cultivating the leaders for this model because, for better or for worse, everyone is a leader at Harvard.”
Ninety-seven LEED green certified building projects have been built on Harvard’s campus—the most among any higher education institution in the world, according the report.
The University has reduced trash per capita by 27 percent between 2006 and 2014, putting it more than halfway to its 2020 goal of a 50 percent reduction. Students, faculty, and staff recycled at a rate of 51 percent in 2014, which, as along with composting, and reuse activities, contributed to the waste reduction, the report read. University-wide water use dropped by 21 percent over the same eight-year period.
“Harvard’s approach to sustainability is constantly evolving, informed by the discovery that comes from working across disciplines, across campus, and across sectors,” Heather A. Henriksen, director of the Office for Sustainability, said in a statement.
The number of Cambridge and Allston commuters who use sustainable transportation to get to work has increased steadily over the past eight years. Eighty-five percent of Longwood commuters using public transportation, rideshare, bicycle or walking. Thirteen percent of employees drove to work alone in 2014.
Last October, Harvard was named a Gold-level Bicycle Friendly University, a designation given out by the League of American Cyclists that recognizes a University’s commitment to providing both routes and incentives for biking. Harvard is the only Ivy League school to achieve gold status, a title it shares with nine other universities across the country.
The report also emphasized health and well-being standards, pointing to the University’s September decision to make Harvard Yard tobacco-free.
The report lists several initiatives that are in progress, such as establishing a baseline for organic landscaping, setting goals for e-waste management, establishing sustainable purchasing standards, and calculating the total amount of landscaped area across all its campuses.

UPDATED: April 15, 2015, at 1:29 a.m.
Two weeks after posters parodying a new campus magazine focused on issues of race and diversity prompted controversy in Pforzheimer House, a group of students have reacted by creating a “collective” to discuss free speech.
The students—who are calling themselves the “John Stuart Mill Society” after dropping "Pforzheimer House" from the group name—formed the group after a series of posters were placed in Pforzheimer that appeared to mock materials publicizing the launch of arts and advocacy magazine Renegade, prompting a fury of responses from students over the House email list. Pforzheimer House Masters Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant responded to the incident with an email to the House indicating that they intended to “take those posters down immediately," referring to the parody materials.
An individual student, not the House Masters, eventually removed the parody posters on her own, according to Harrington.
Students who created the new free speech group were “galled” by the the House masters’ original indication that they intended to take down the parody posters, according to Daniel J. Solomon ’16, a Crimson editorial writer and a member of the group who publicized the group over Pforzheimer’s house email list. Members of the new group, which currently numbers about 10, “are concerned about what that meant,” Solomon said.
One of the students involved in the new free speech group put up the parody posters, according to Solomon. Solomon declined to name the student.
In a joint email to The Crimson, Durant and Harrington wrote that in their original emailed response to the poster incident, they sought to explain the value they place in discussing difficult topics with a range of views. They also wanted to address the “unattributed posters that had appeared in our home and that were causing escalating confusion, anxiety and deep pain.”
“We had on the other side an open conversation on our student list about all the issues raised, no aspect of which was ever silenced,” Harrington and Durant wrote. “Never have we objected to the expression of any views, popular or unpopular.”
In addition to their objections to the House masters’ response to the incident, Solomon said group members take issue with the message they feel that a member of the magazine sent in comments over the Pfoho email list in response to the controversy.
Members of Renegade did not respond to requests for comment.
Sebastian G. Devora ’15, a Pfoho resident who sent an email over the House email list addressing the House masters’ response to the incident, said in an interview that the parody posters “were pretty offensive.” Still, he said he felt that it would have been “wrong” for the House masters to take them down given their position of authority.
Devora also said he thinks the new free speech group was “started mainly to antagonize.”
The group will meet on Wednesday evening in the Pfoho Igloo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate students at Harvard have launched an effort to unionize, and while a 2004 ruling by the National Labor Relations Board may stand in their way, labor experts predict that a future reconsideration of that decision could pave an easier path toward unionization.
In 2004, under the George W. Bush administration, the NLRB sided with Brown University, which argued that its graduate students, who also served as teaching assistants, were primarily students rather than primarily employees, and therefore Brown was not required to recognize their union.
That decision suggests that Harvard’s own graduate students will face an uphill battle to form a recognized union, but today’s NLRB—which experts consider to be more liberal—may reconsider the decision in the coming years. The board may decide to call teaching assistants employees, some experts interviewed argued, breaking the dichotomy between the two categories.
As a private university, Harvard falls under the jurisdiction of the NLRB, rather than state labor laws, which dictate the unionization process for state university employees. Harvard graduate students’ unionization efforts depend in part on the NLRB, according to experts.
“The Obama board will have to fundamentally distinguish or reverse [the 2004 Brown ruling] in order for the unionization process to be successful,” said William B. Gould IV, a Stanford law professor emeritus and a former chairman of the NLRB under the Clinton administration.
If recognized, forming a union could enable graduate students to collectively bargain with the University, potentially creating a more centralized complaint system and providing a stronger negotiating position, Harvard graduate student organizers argue.
The NLRB was formed in 1935 and is composed of five members who serve five-year terms. They are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, creating a partisan dynamic largely determined by the sitting president, according to experts interviewed.
With its current composition, the NLRB is likely to reconsider the Brown decision, argued Risa L. Lieberwitz, a professor of labor and employment law at Cornell.
“It’s a good moment to reconsider this question and to come out with a decision that says that TAs and RAs are doing the work of the university in a way that should lead to a conclusion that they’re employees,” Lieberwitz said, referencing the makeup of the NLRB as well as recent university trends in hiring more non-tenure track professors and graduate students to bear a greater proportion of teaching responsibilities.
While graduate student unionization faced an uphill battle under the Bush administration, some experts argue that the NLRB under Obama is more likely to categorize graduate students as university employees.
“In its liberal mode, the board has said yes and in the conservative mode has said no,” said Michael Gold, an associate professor of labor relations, law, and history at Cornell, referencing the NLRB’s previous rulings on whether or not graduate students should be considered employees. “In its current situation, it would likely say yes.”
The NLRB’s New York regional office was scheduled to review Columbia graduate students’ request for union recognition at the end of March.
At Harvard, graduate students who unionize could directly demand that the University recognize them, no matter the NLRB’s position on their employment status, according to David Rosenfeld, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Law and a labor law expert. But if left unrecognized and unprotected by the NLRB, students could be fired for labor strikes, he said.
“That would take a lot of courage,” Rosenfeld said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Senior Class Committee has chosen four members of the Class of 2015 to speak at its annual Class Day festivities, scheduled for May 27.
Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Taylor K. Phillips ’15 will deliver Ivy orations at the celebration, and Ethan G. Loewi ’15 and Reina A.E. Gattuso ’15 will deliver the Harvard orations. Gattuso is a Crimson columnist and magazine writer and Loewi a former Crimson news writer.
The Harvard orations tend to cover more reflective topics, while the Ivy speeches typically have lighter themes.
The speakers were chosen after a three-round selection process from a pool of about 60 applicants, according to Class Marshals Megan B. Prasad ’15, an inactive Crimson magazine editor, and Bob Wu ’15.
Prasad and Wu said the selection process was extremely competitive this year. The speakers were ultimately chosen because of the diversity of themes they plan to cover, Prasad and Wu added.
“Not only do they have excellent speeches, but they have a range of themes that we thought would really speak to the Harvard class as we’re one day away from graduation,” Wu said.
In one word, Clark described his speech as “silly.”
“My speech is about the singular thing that has united the Class of 2015 in our four years at this institution,” Clark said. “We’ll see what that is.”
Phillips’s speech includes various statistical and mathematical analyses about “what it means to be a millennial.”
“It’s funny for a couple of reasons, mostly because I’m an English concentrator,” she said.
Loewi, who will speak about self-doubt, said that he chose the topic because he wanted “to give voice to some ideas that aren’t always common place at graduation ceremonies.”
“It’s a little bit subversive,” he added. “I think a few monocles will be dropped.”
Gattuso will be speaking about the value of “embracing our own vulnerabilities,”  adding that she hopes to bring a “dose of fabulous” to the Class Day proceedings.
The four Class Day speakers all expressed their excitement and happiness at having been chosen on Tuesday. Phillips also said she was grateful to speak alongside the other three orators.
“I was elated, I might say, to find out I have the opportunity to speak,” Clark said. “I’m beyond excited.”
Also on Tuesday, the Senior Class Committee recognized five students who collaborated on writing the Class of 2015 ode, as well as who will perform it at the celebration. The class ode will be a reflection on the Yard’s gates and their symbolic nature.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Flat” was the first word Harvard softball coach Jenny Allard used to describe her team’s performance Tuesday afternoon.
The hosting Crimson (17-17, 8-4 Ivy) yielded six unanswered runs to fall to Boston University (9-23, 1-7 Patriot League), 6-2, in a nonconference matchup at Soldier Softball Field.
“We didn’t play well,” Allard said. “We were very flat. Our bats were not firing, we didn’t string any hits together, the runs we scored they gave us, and in the first inning when we had bases loaded we didn’t capitalize.”
In the first inning, Harvard appeared to be off to a safe start, as starting pitcher Taylor Cabe was able to keep the Terriers scoreless through the top half of the first. The Crimson offense then took over and put two runs on the board without having to record a hit. BU started junior right handed pitcher Melanie Russell, who gave up four walks to the first five batters she faced. Two of her walked batters came around to score, giving Harvard an early lead.
After the Terriers pulled Russell in favor of sophomore right hander Makinna Akers in the middle of the first inning, the Crimson bats went silent. Akers held Harvard scoreless for the remainder of the game, halting what seemed like a Crimson rally early in the game. Akers took the win on the day, allowing three hits and no runs in her 6.2 innings of work.
“The first pitcher [BU] threw wasn’t finding the zone very much, and then they changed pitchers on us, and I think that might’ve thrown our energy for a loop a little bit,” senior shortstop Emily Gusse said. “We thought we kind of had them in the bag. There wasn’t enough effort at the plate. You have to see the pitchers more and talk more to each other about what you’re seeing.”
The Terriers found their stride later in the game, as the team tallied four runs off of four hits and a Harvard error. The visitors’ surge forced Allard to go to the bullpen for junior Morgan Groom, as Cabe left the game charged with the loss after giving up seven hits and striking out four batters in her 3.1 innings.
Groom staved off BU briefly, getting out of the fourth inning without giving up any more runs, but the Terriers tacked on two more runs over the next two innings.
Harvard appeared to have one last push in the bats in the bottom of the seventh when sophomore catcher Gianna Panariello led off with a double into right center field and advanced to third on a fielder’s choice, but she was ultimately left stranded.
The Terriers picked up their third straight win over Harvard to extend a streak dating back to April 2013. The Crimson will visit Boston College on Thursday.
Allard had planned to split pitching over the game, yet felt that the change may have come too late. So far this season, Harvard has evenly divided time among the four pitchers on its roster.
“We just want to get all the pitchers time this week,” Allard said. “Taylor’s been throwing pretty well so we gave her the start. We probably left her in one inning too long, and they started to get on her a bit and string some things together…. We want both of them to be more consistent. That’s the goal.”
On the offensive side of the ball, Harvard struggled the entire game to string hits together. In a break from its recent offensive success, the team only tallied three hits over the course of the seven innings. The Crimson had scored 26 runs in the previous four games heading into Tuesday’s matchup.
“Your ideal is to hit, so you have to swing at good pitches when they come,” Gusse said. “I think something unique about today is we had an abnormal amount of walks, so we did use the ump’s zone, but we weren’t getting the hits to keep it moving.”

Jimmy Vesey will be taking his final exams in the Czech Republic next month.
The junior Hobey Hat Trick finalist for the Harvard men’s hockey team was officially named to USA Hockey’s initial 16-man roster on Tuesday afternoon for the 2015 IIHF World Championships, which will be held in Prague and Ostrava, Czech Republic, May 1-17.
On Friday, Vesey addressed reports of his roster selection after the Hobey Baker Award ceremony at Northeastern's Matthews Arena, saying that he was waiting for approval from Harvard’s Administrative Board to take his exams in the Czech Republic. As a freshman, Vesey took his first semester exams in Ufa, Russia during the World Junior Championships, where he notched four assists and a semifinal goal to help Team USA to a gold medal.
“It’s kind of still up in the air a bit,” Vesey said on Friday. “We need to hear back from [the Ad Board]...so I am hoping to get that confirmed. I think it will be a great experience.”
With the Ad Board’s blessing, Vesey joins a talented lineup that includes NHL players and a major conference rival.
Carolina Hurricanes defenseman Justin Faulk headlines 10 Team USA skaters with NHL experience. Faulk was a member of the 2014 U.S. Olympic team. Other NHL players include Boston Bruins defenseman Torey Krug and Edmonton Oilers forward Matt Hendricks. Still other NHLers may join the roster upon elimination in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
Meanwhile, Yale sophomore Alex Lyon is the roster’s only goaltender. Like Vesey, Lyon received First Team All-American honors on Friday after a dominant season that included a school-record seven shutouts. Vesey beat Lyon twice for game-winning goals during the ECAC quarterfinals in March.
Vesey, who led all NCAA Division I scorers with 32 goals this season, will make his senior national team debut against Finland on May 1 in Group B in the preliminary round, which will run through May 12 with games against Norway (May 2), Russia (May 4), Belarus (May 7), Denmark (May 8), Slovenia (May 10), and Slovakia (May 12).
Should Team USA finish in the top four of Group B, Vesey and the rest of the squad will advance to the quarterfinals beginning on May 14. The semifinals and finals will be held on May 16 and 17, respectively.
Vesey’s selection caps a breakout year for the Nashville Predators draft pick, who captured ECAC and Ivy Player of the Year honors and the Walter Brown Award while leading Harvard to its first ECAC title and NCAA tournament appearance in nine seasons. Vesey announced his intent on March 31 to return to school for his senior season.

UPDATED: April 15, 2015, at 1:10 p.m.
Despite losing the second half by a goal, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team decisively edged out the Crusaders, 12-4, Tuesday night at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium.
A game-high four goals by sophomore Marisa Romeo helped Harvard (6-6, 3-2 Ivy) to a 10-1 start in the first half. The Crimson held steady through the final minutes to draw to .500 with three games left in the regular season.
“The offense was really clicking in the first half,” said junior co-captain Audrey Todd, who also recorded a hat trick in the game’s first 30 minutes.
Nine of Harvard’s 12 goals were unassisted. Todd scored first on a free position shot just over five minutes into the game to catalyze an 8-0 Harvard run to open the game.
The Crusaders would not get on the board before Romeo recorded her fourth unassisted goal of the night at with 12:13 left in the first half.
The Syracuse, N.Y. native leads the Crimson with 36 goals and has netted eight hat tricks this year. She also recorded an assist on Harvard’s second goal of the game, a strike by freshman midfielder Eliza Guild.
Romeo and Todd combined to score or assist the first nine goals of the match. Junior Kaitlin Concilio broke through for the Crusaders’ first goal on a free position shot with 9:16 left in the first frame.
“We were winning the draw control, possessing the ball well, dodging hard, drawing fouls and finishing our shots,” Todd said. “Ultimately, that gave us a nice lead heading into halftime.”
Four of the Crimson’s goals came from free position opportunities in the opening frame, with the Crusaders (4-12) tallying a total of 13 fouls for the period. However, Harvard would finish the game with 27 fouls of its own after executing 18 fouls in the second frame.
Holy Cross senior Laura Ryan scored the game’s final goal on a free position shot with over 12 minutes left. Harvard shifted its focus in the second half and tried to get more players involved on offense.
“In the second half, since we had the lead, we were trying to work for really high-percentage opportunities,” Todd said. “Also, as only two of our 10 first-half goals were assisted, we were trying to look for cutters a bit more often.”
The change in strategy led to an increase in turnovers and fouls on the Crimson’s end, but the result was never in doubt. Harvard also experimented with a zone defense.
Sophomore defender Emma Ford led the Crimson defense with two caused turnovers, two draw controls, and three ground balls. Also grabbing a team-high two draw controls, sophomore attack Meg Hennessey notched one of only four total assists by either opponent for the game.
“Our team has played a really tough schedule this year, and I think that showed tonight against Holy Cross,” said junior co-captain defender Tory Waldstein. “We were able to play faster than them and be really aggressive. I thought our defense played well and we don't usually play a zone so it is always fun to work on that.”
Freshmen accounted for all three of Harvard’s second-half points.
Rookie midfielder Julia Glynn chipped in a first frame goal as well as Harvard final goal. Freshman midfielder Nekele McCall netted the Crimson’s other goal in the second period after a feed from Glynn.
All three of Harvard’s goaltenders saw playing time on Tuesday. Junior Kelly Weis picked up her sixth win of the year with two saves on four shots. Freshman Meredith Brown took over with under 20 minutes to play in the second half, and classmate Olivia Gundrum closed out the game’s final 2:20 in her third career appearance.
According to Todd, Tuesday highlighted details that she and her teammates can improve as they prepare for their Saturday road match at Cornell. With two weekends left in the Ivy League regular season, the Big Red and the Crimson are jockeying for a berth in the four-team Ivy League tournament.
“I think that going into Cornell, we will keep working on the draw control and ground balls,” said Todd, who has now recorded hat tricks in each of her last two games. “Fifty-fifty balls win games, and defensively, we need to be able to get the ball when we put it on the ground.”

After an up and down first round that saw the group shoot 15 shots off the lead, the Crimson women’s golf team turned in lower scores in each of its next two rounds, finishing fourth among a stacked field at the Silverado Showdown in Napa, Calif.
In a battle of Beaver State five-person teams that came down to the final holes, 32nd-ranked Oregon held onto the lead on the final day, holding off Oregon State by just one stroke.
The 15-team tournament attracted six squads that were ranked in the top 50 nationally, but Harvard managed to top four of those teams with the second-best team score in the final round. The Crimson jumped from sixth to fourth place after a third-round team score of plus-2.
Leading Harvard was sophomore Anne Cheng, whose fifth-place finish lifted the Crimson to the top-five result. Cheng, who teed off out of the first spot for Harvard, saw her score drop as the tournament went on, and eventually shot a one-under-par 71 in the final round. She had entered the day just inside the top 20, but a solid last round pushed her towards the top of the leaderboard.
Senior Brenna Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports editor, had the third-best round three score shooting out of the third spot, and her 69 on Tuesday afternoon vaulted her 20 spots to a 13th-place finish—the same spot as junior teammate Courtney Hooton, who shot a 72 and 73 in her second and third rounds, respectively.
While Harvard was in the middle of the pack for par 3 and par 5 scoring for the tournament, it’s 4.17 par 4 average topped all teams. The Crimson also had the second-most birdies for the event with 31.
Among other schools, the Crimson topped No. 12 Northwestern and No. 34 California, the former by two strokes and the latter by four.

Yesterday afternoon, Harvard students greeted the first signs of Spring with a warm, enthusiastic, and long-overdue welcome. This welcome ranged from people playing catch in the yard, sunbathing in bikinis (questionable move for early April), and most of all throwing excessive amounts of colored chalk at each other as a part of Harvard’s Holi celebration.
For anyone unfamiliar with Holi, it is an Indian festival of color that welcomes Spring. Celebrated all around the world, Holi is essentially just one big color fight that, at Harvard, consists of undergrads running around throwing powdered paint at each other for almost an hour. With every color of the rainbow forming a massive cloud of color over the MAC Quad, the event was certainly a sight to see. The enthusiastic shouts of the participants were almost enough to drown out the music blasting from the Owl, which somehow found the time to throw down on a Sunday afternoon.
After attending Holi, I felt like I’d share a few pointers for anyone planning to attend next year. First and foremost, wear clothes that you don’t care about, because they will get ruined. Definitely not the time to wear your brand new shoes or your favorite shirt. Second of all, go with friends you trust. It’s far too easy to smacked in the face with a fist full of neon yellow powder, only to find that after your second shower your hair still has a lovely yellowish tint… how enticing. And finally, get there on time! Missing the opening ceremony where everyone throws color up in the air is a real bummer (not that I would know that from personal experience or anything…).
Thank you, Holi, for introducing a Spring that many of us thought would never come. Keep calm and color on!

Spring has finally sprung which means that it is finally socially appropriate to eat ice cream in public. Okay, who are we kidding; it is always socially appropriate to eat ice cream in public. But there’s only one day of the year when you can get (non-HUDS) ice cream for free. And not just any non-HUDS ice cream, but specifically the (completely objectively) single best brand of ice cream in the world: Ben and Jerry’s. Whether you prefer Phish Food, Cherry Garcia, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, or something in between, you have the opportunity to get a scoop for free between noon and 8 p.m. Tuesday, April 14. Stop by the Ben and Jerry’s in the Garage and get your free cone—and consider donating a couple of your saved dollars to BRYE, a PBHA program that works with the children of refugees in the Boston area. Free ice cream and helping out a great cause—it doesn’t get better than that. Enjoy!

In what the group is calling "Harvard Heat Week," which began on April 12, Divest Harvard has been protesting outside of University President Drew G. Faust’s office. As a result, Faust and other administrators have not been able to get into their offices. Here are five ways, courtesy of Flyby, that President Faust can get into her office and get back to her very important business:
Of course, Divest Harvard has every right to protest this week, and we’re glad to see students speaking up for what they believe in (read: don’t be mad at us for making a joke about you). But come on, President Faust, don’t let these kids keep you out of your office.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 15, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the date of the first day of Divest Harvard's "Heat Week." In fact, it began on April 12, not April 13.

To the wonderful students who have been admitted to all eight Ivy League Schools this year, congratulations!! You are every parent’s dream child, and every other high school senior’s worst enemy. Now, you have the difficult task of choosing among these prestigious schools. But it doesn’t have to be so difficult. We can you help you consider some factors to help you narrow down your choices and find the college that’s right for you:
1) LocationAs they always say, location, location, location. You’re going to be spending the next four years of your life in one area, so make sure it’s the absolute best. For example, Harvard is perfectly situated. It’s right next to Harvard Square, home to so many stores and restaurants and CVS locations (yes, that’s plural). What does New Haven have anyways?
2) Ease of TravelWhen you get tired of campus life, it’s always important to get away from it all. Harvard is just a few T-stops away from the heart of downtown Boston, while far enough away to feel like its own campus within Cambridge. When you’re a freshman at Dartmouth itching for a night out in town, where will you be able to go in Hanover, NH on a Saturday night?
3) School ColorsFrom attending home games to working out at the gym, remember that you will be sporting your school colors for decades to come. Crimson is flattering on everyone and great for all occasions. Imagine the horror of having to wear orange attire to reunions for the rest of your life!
4) SportsSpeaking of extracurriculars, it’s important to attend a school with winning teams so you can have a lot of school pride. Having teams in NCAA tournaments and on the winning side of a long rivalry is not unfamiliar to Harvard. Do we ever even hear anything about Columbia's football team?
With these points above, we hope your choice will be much easier to make. Remember, not all Ivy League schools were created equal. When making your final decision, choose wisely (and by wisely, we mean Harvard)!
