After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re looking for an excellent dark comedy with unique characters, small-town charm, and gripping drama, go watch “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” If you’re in the mood for a terribly acted “dark comedy” that is neither dark nor comedic, waste a hundred minutes watching “Spent.”
Directed by Lisa Mikitarian, “Spent” follows a greedy wife and son waiting for their cheapskate husband and father, Herbert, to die of a brain tumor. However, a Fourth of July miracle cures Herbert of his affliction, thwarting their plans to spend his inheritance. Disappointed by Herbert’s newfound vitality, the wife and son try to turn the miracle into a tragedy with rat poison.
Considering the film’s potential to be an enjoyable sleeper hit based on its premise’s solid foundation, it's amazing how all that potential effortlessly goes to waste. For starters, the acting in this film is as subtle as a bullhorn. All the actors seem to have learned about human emotion just the other day, and are overcompensating for a prior life without it.
To be fair, their characters are about as deep as a kiddie pool, so it may make sense to play them like Saturday morning cartoon characters. In a dark comedy, the audience is supposed to feel a bit sympathetic towards their deeply flawed anti-heroic protagonists, but “Spent“ showcases superficial characters that are completely unlikable. Every single character, despite their vapidness and desperation, attempts to be somewhat interesting. For example, Herbert’s son engages in random musical numbers with his monotone voice to add a forced “quirky” element to the film.
Characters aside, the film’s editing is terrible. “Spent” has surprisingly solid cinematography, displaying impressively smooth camerawork and a good understanding of shot composition. One of the opening scenes, for example, has a masterful wide-angle shot of a bedroom with the morning light streaming through, which gave me false hope for a quality film. However, even when the film does something right, it has to ruin it by pairing good shots with, in the words of the film’s closed captioning, “sultry rock music” and “soft sultry music.” Not to mention that this movie unironically used a record-scratch. After that, you’d almost expect a freeze frame and a “Yup, that’s me, now you’re probably wondering how I got here,” but surprise, surprise, “Spent” disappoints once again.
“Spent” was made on a shoestring budget of $25,000, which may have played a role into its abysmal quality. However, its biggest problem by far is its screenplay. If this movie had quality dialogue and a morsel of comedic tension in its final script, the film would have been ten times better. Nevertheless, a dark comedy can really forgo anything but a witty and thoughtful script. “Spent”’s attempts to be charming fail miserably as worn out comedic tropes are rehashed and quips fall flat. For example, much of the comedy revolves around Herbert being a penny-pinching miser, but you can only extend that creative fabric so far. The constant reliance on the gag makes the film feel like an SNL skit that has gone on far too long.
But even these filmic faux pas are no match for the final 20 minutes of the film. Without going into spoiler territory because, after reading this review, you must be dying to see it, “Spent” undergoes a complete genre transformation. The terrible dark comedy turns into a terrible moralistic melodrama in an instant. Dear “Spent,” if you’re going to be a bad movie, at least stick to your genre. Don’t pivot at the last minute and make all your initial appeal completely worthless.
Do not spend any time watching “Spent.” It’s a poorly-executed drudgery of a film. There will be no Fourth of July miracle for viewers who undergo this affliction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A boy in my year once asked me who my favorite author was. When I replied that I loved Jane Austen, he seemed a bit confused.
“Is she the one who wrote about Victorian ladies and tea parties?” he asked.
This time I was confused—not so much by what he said, but by the way he said it. I thought that Jane Austen had long ago shaken off her reputation as a writer of frivolous love stories. I had even learned recently in Professor Deidre Lynch’s class—Jane Austen’s Fiction and Fans—that for many years, the famed author had been recognized for her literary merit: her delightful writing, satire, complex characters and masterful use of free-indirect discourse, a technique that many other names in literature—including Virginia Woolf—used.
Why, then, was what she wrote about still reduced to “tea parties?” Yes, this boy was ignorant, but when I thought more about what he had said, I realized that the reason so many people mistake Austen’s intricate narratives and heroines for “tea parties” and “Victorian ladies” is because of the deep-seated fanaticism that is now inseparable from the books, the fetishization of the period in which the books themselves are set, and their many romanticized and often unfaithful adaptations. This breed of fanaticism centers more on the worship of Colin Firth emerging out of a lake in a see-through shirt in the 1995 adaptation of “Pride and Prejudice” than on Mr. Darcy and his character, or Keira Knightley in the 2005 adaptation’s period costume rather than Elizabeth herself. It is this more than anything which seems to encourage both the dismissal of Austen and the stereotype that she is a writer of ladies and “tea parties.”
More than any other of her novels, “Persuasion” proves how inaccurate these stereotypes are. The book’s 200th anniversary seems as good a time as any to reflect on its brilliance and quiet power. Written later on in her life and her last completed novel before her death in 1817, ”Persuasion” has less of a following than titles like “Emma” and “Pride and Prejudice,” yet “Persuasion” is considered by academics as a literary powerhouse in its own right. Its subject is also vastly different and darker. We meet our heroine Anne Elliot when she is twenty-seven years old and has “lost her bloom”—she is the castoff among her sisters and still lives with her profligate father. Besides this immediate family, Anne finds comfort in her maternal neighbor Lady Russell as Anne’s mother has been dead for quite some time.
Due to the family’s declining financial situation, the Elliots must rent out their home while first spending some time visiting Anne’s sister Mary (married to Charles Musgrove) and then visiting Bath. These events coincide with the end of the Napoleonic War when many soldiers return back to England, bringing a Captain Frederick Wentworth into Anne’s circle of friends. It is revealed that eight years ago, Anne and Wentworth were in love and engaged to be married, however, Lady Russell persuaded her to break off the engagement due to Wentworth’s lack of wealth and position. Now significantly wealthier and just as handsome, Wentworth re-enters England and Anne’s world triggering regret and pain as she re-examines her unfortunate decision so many years before.
Like many other of Austen’s works, “Persuasion” is a love story at its essence, but beneath its surface we encounter much bleaker subjects, such as injustice. Anne Elliot is an accomplished young woman despite the lack of voice she holds in her own household. She is unfairly looked over by all those around her, dismissed for her lack of beauty, her single status, and her age. However, her maturity helps her bear this treatment silently and not take it to heart.  Her rejection of Wentworth leads to a misery and heartbreak that lasts for years on end. It is this mistake that torments her and leaves her with her characteristic selflessness that so often borders on guilt.
Though Austen writes in third person, the free-indirect discourse seamlessly weaves Anne’s thoughts into the narration such that hers is the primary perspective. For example, in the scene when Mary tells her that Wentworth has found her much altered since their last meeting, the narration interlaces Anne’s point of view into what would traditionally be an objective point of view: ‘So altered that she should not have known her again!’ These were words which could not but dwell with her. Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them. They were of sobering tendency; they allayed agitation; they composed and consequently must make her happier.”  Of course, Anne is not happier, the word “must” flagging her inner thoughts and attempts to believe her own lies. At this point in her career, Austen clearly had perfected this style, which often borders on the modern.
Besides the intrinsic sadness we find in Anne, there are other ominous subjects that lurk beneath the fabric. These include the horrors of the Napoleonic War, the death of loved ones, stillborn babies, and illness. While these topics are not the novel’s focus, their presence is nonetheless unsettling, serving to remind the reader that despite the social cues and conventions that make up Victorian life, the basic facts of life still stand.
These morose elements are not necessary to form the “serious” novel that is often pitted against Austen’s “silly romances.” In fact, sadness is not indicative in any such way of literary merit and nor is “Persuasion”’s sadness what makes it great. It is more about the way the novel questions our understanding of sadness and how we as humans respond to this feeling. One of the many other things that makes it great is her unraveling of the reader’s expectations. Just when you think that “Persuasion” will make you tear your heart out in empathy at Anne’s suffering, it makes you laugh at Mary’s hypochondriac tendency and tactlessness. In all it does, “Persuasion” is all-encompassing, bringing together all parts of human life. To answer his question, there are no “tea parties” here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a move that breaks with at least five years of precedent, the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council, which governs Harvard’s three sororities, have decided not to release recruitment numbers from this year's rush. Reports, however, indicate that the number of students rushing sororities has more than halved as the sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations—a broad classification which includes fraternities, sororities, and final clubs––have been implemented. This sudden drop in student interest represents a precipitous end to years of steady membership growth for Harvard’s sororities.
The sanctions on single-gender social groups, which were recently affirmed in a vote by the Harvard Corporation, carry severe consequences. Starting with the Class of 2021, which arrived at Harvard last fall, students who are members of final clubs or Greek organizations will not be allowed to hold leadership positions in recognized student organizations, become varsity captains, or receive endorsements from the College for a number of prestigious fellowships. Not all new sorority members are freshmen, but many are, and will therefore face these repercussions.
Although it has become clear since the Harvard Corporation’s vote that the aforementioned penalties will be instituted, exactly how the administration will execute them remains stunningly unclear. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—who, along with University President Drew G. Faust, championed the sanctions policy from its inception—has declined to comment on how the sanctions will be implemented or when that decision will be announced. Consequently, we worry that current freshmen do not realize the gravity of the punishment they are voluntarily taking on.
We respect the College’s decision not to rush the implementation of the sanctions, but we are concerned that administrators have not adequately informed freshmen about exactly how the finalized sanctions will be enforced––even though recruitment for many single-gender groups have started and concluded. We believe this makes the sanctions seem less definite and undermines their legitimacy.
As a result, we believe sororities themselves should take strides to inform their would-be members about how their lives will be affected by the sanctions. Three Harvard sororities have chosen to remain single-gender this year in in spite of the sanctions. It is incumbent upon them to explain the consequences of joining to potential new members.
Unlike in previous years, membership in these social organizations will have tangible negative effects for current freshmen. It would be contrary to the principles of these organizations, built on women’s empowerment and female friendship, to accept applicants without properly reinforcing the ramifications of joining.
Beyond potentially confusing freshmen, the convoluted sanction implementation process gives rise to a further dilemma. Without a proper enforcement mechanism in place, the sanctions might be easily circumvented. Despite the ostensibly well-purposed “bridge program” the administration has announced that will allow all-female social groups to keep a “gender focus” for at least three years, we are concerned that unrecognized social organizations—particularly male and female final clubs—will use the guise of being “single gender-focused” to remain, in practice, single gender.
By taking advantage of this apparent loophole in the sanctions, these organizations might harm groups that are truly gender-neutral and focused on female empowerment.
We are not aware of how administrators plan to determine whether or not these “gender focused” clubs have truly gender neutral membership. For example, the Fleur-de-Lis, formerly Harvard’s chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma and the first sorority on campus to go gender-neutral, has claimed that it refused to solicit demographic information related to gender identity from its members. We thus urge the College to consider soliciting this demographic information from technically “gender-neutral” organizations in order to gauge their progress.
As freshmen begin to navigate an unfortunately and increasingly complicated social scene at Harvard, we hope that the College will serve as a guide and support, rather than source of confusion. Simultaneously, we encourage the upperclassman leadership of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations to build communities that can include and accommodate them under the new sanctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s three weeks into the semester and you start hearing rumors that a lot of the freshmen are homesick. Most of them have never been this far from home, and they grasp for anything to remind them of their communities. As the president of an affinity organization, you’re reminded of how painful, alien, uncomfortable, and difficult your first months at Harvard were.
You decide to host an event with comfort food and advice from upperclassmen. It takes you five hours to plan the event. Even though you’re drowning in work, haven’t gone to the gym in weeks, and find yourself generally overwhelmed, you spend five hours planning. If there’s a chance those freshmen, who share backgrounds similar to yours, will feel more supported than you did, you’ll make the time.
You’ll make time, over and over again. An hour and a half for a resume workshop. Two hours serving as a pseudo-therapist or emotional sounding board. Three hours to take them winter coat shopping. Four hours to set up a mentorship program. Countless hours reassuring others that they belong.
You might begin to call the time and energy you’ve spent unpaid labor. It comes with  no financial gain, little prestige, and only sporadic appreciation. Unpaid labor, for decades now, falls largely on students who come from underrepresented backgrounds.
In 1976, RAZA, the undergraduate Mexican-American student organization, was in charge of recruiting Mexican-American applicants. These efforts were successful, with the number of admitted Chicano students jumping from 18 to 32 in just one year. Even so, the recruiters were not paid and their recruiting trips were “no vacation.” Undergraduates even had to fundraise amongst themselves to pay for a plane ticket to recruit in Los Angeles when the Admission Office would not fund the fare. Students were doing work that was clearly the College’s responsibility.
Hours of students’ time has been spent educating the University about its blind spots. Students were instrumental in the push to bring ethnic studies to Harvard, in 1972, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2016. On issues from curriculum to decor, administrators have relied on student labor to guide their decisions.
In 2003, the Black Students Association wrote and published a 322-page “Black Guide to Harvard.” It offered information to help black students navigate Harvard, ranging from hair salon suggestions to acknowledgements of serious campus issues. Just a year later, Latinx students debuted “La Vida at Harvard: The Unofficial Latino Guide to Harvard University.” Similarly, the publication served as a resource center, outlining classes and restaurants that might be of interest to Latinx students.
These publications undoubtedly helped black and Latino students, but would not have been possible without an extreme amount of time and effort. “I can’t believe this project is over. I feel as if I have just given birth,” one student told The Crimson.
These examples, and the countless others that have gone unnoticed, share a couple of things in common. They’re conceptualized and executed by undergraduates. Students fill gaps administrators leave, either because of a lack of programming or because their programming doesn’t sufficiently address the needs of marginalized groups. When administrators fail, students pick up the slack. Though time consuming, they manage to find funds, venues, and the time to plan programming that will support their peers.
And this labor is, more often than not, unpaid.
The University has, luckily, begun to compensate students for work that was previously unpaid. Peer Advising Fellows are given a $500 stipend each semester. The Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, the Admissions Office, and the Harvard Foundation all employ undergraduates to help with their efforts. The Office of Equity Diversity and Inclusion hires Diversity Peer Educators to create programming around issues of equity on campus.
But these offices are only able to employ a small percentage of the individuals doing work that supports students, and their efforts often fail to sufficiently address student need. Every year, UMRP seeks volunteers to help with the call-a-thons when students are admitted. The events put on by the Harvard Foundation and the Diversity Peer Educators often feel insufficient. They host important events, but they are generally opt-in and too general to address the immediate needs of struggling students from underrepresented backgrounds.
When considering the influence on students, particularly those who are struggling, programming put on by affinity groups is generally more focused and effective. It generally comes out of goodwill—the same way that advising administrators, informal mentoring, and other forms of unpaid labor do.
After we acknowledge these efforts as what they are, we should seek ways to ensure that students are compensated for the indispensable work they do. Perhaps this includes encouraging (or requiring) the presidents of affinity groups to be Diversity Peer Educators or Foundation Interns, both groups with missions aligned to those of affinity groups. More radically, the College could create stipends for the president of any organization that directs supports students from marginalized backgrounds.
Unpaid student labor is not a fringe occurrence, applying in only a few instances. It ensures that hundreds of students feel like they belong, like they will survive,  and like they have a stake in this university. Let’s acknowledge the importance of unpaid labor, and give its bearers what they deserve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On any Harvard tour, you’ll hear the tour guide proclaim how the University has led the country for centuries, and when you walk by the stadium, how we led the way in setting the rules for college football.
The sport was a bloody sport in its infancy. Players were protected by little more than leather caps, and the game very much resembled rugby. The sport was so rough that in 1905, at least eighteen players died from its injuries.
The ruthlessness got it banned from several colleges, and former President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, called for the game to be changed or removed from the athletics program. Even Harvard alumnus and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, called for reforms to the game.
To these calls, a series of changes were proposed that included widening the field by forty yards in order to avoid some of those deadly collisions. But we’d just built a new stadium for it! Instead of accepting someone else’s changes, we proposed and adopted the forward pass. Other schools followed, and the rest is history.
It’s been more than a century since then, and though the pads and helmets have evolved, the game has not gotten all that much safer. According to a study conducted between 1990 and 2010, each year, approximately a dozen or so football players across the country die and many more were seriously injured.
Just this year, a student in my own Class of 2021 took the field for the first time as a Harvard football player, only to have his season and life irreversibly changed. Ben M. Abercrombie ’21, a promising young athlete from Alabama, has spent the last five months recovering because of a neck injury that left him paralyzed.
Down in my home state of Florida, a defensive back for the University of Miami, Malek Young, suffered a career-ending injury to his neck as well.
These players put their health, their education, and their lives on the line of scrimmage seventy times a game, for half the year, but it’s not the even big hits that scare me the most.
It’s the small stuff that’s most worrisome. Not the guys getting laid out on the field by a bone-crushing tackle, but the snap after snap after snap that linemen and others endure. Seventy times a game, college football players crash heads, and the click and slap of shoulder-pads against helmets and of plastic hitting plastic echo throughout the stadium. The hits take a toll.
In one recent study of 202 former football players’ brains, more than 99 percent of NFL players, 91 percent of college players, and 21 percent of high school players were diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy—brain damage caused by repetitive blunt force trauma that has been linked to memory loss, depression, and dementia, among other things.
This isn’t new science.
It’s been highlighted in newspapers, on television, and in movies, but we make the choice to ignore it at the cost of more and more players developing the disease every year. We’re so obsessed with the hits that any top-rate broadcast features a satellite microphone on the sidelines designed to pick up each and every one of those crunches.
The harder the hit, the greater the amazement. It’s nothing short of watching gladiators smash each others’ skulls in from the stands of the Coliseum. It’s the stuff that draws people in, it’s the stuff that gets people watching, and it’s what’s killing these players.
I’ve loved football my entire life. Growing up in Miami, I went to Miami Hurricanes games with my father, and I still watch them play on Saturdays. But it’s not fair. Not to the players, not to their families, and not to the generations of athletes who are just now putting on helmets they’ll don for years to come.
All sports have some determined level of risks, but none has the rampant issues that football does. It’s ripe time that Harvard suits up for the title it bears so proudly—the greatest university in the world—and takes a stand for the future of student athletes.
Colleges and universities are places where students go to learn and grow, and sports that have been demonstrated to adversely affect the neurological development of young adults have no place in the halls of higher education.
It’s time for us to call for much-needed revisions to the sport, to change the rules, and to ensure that the game is played as safely as possible. Anything else is gross negligence and a dereliction of the duty of educating. Harvard can and should come out on this first. It might not be what’s easy or profitable, but it’s what’s right.
And that’s called leadership.

Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira sent a University-wide email Thursday morning to confirm cases of influenza and “presumptive mumps” across Harvard’s campus.
Mumps most recently appeared on campus in June 2017 with two confirmed cases. The virus was particularly active during the spring of 2016, with over 60 confirmed cases recorded prior to the end of the 2016 academic year. In 2016, infected students were quarantined for five days by mandate of the Cambridge Public Health Department.
As in his previous emails about mumps, Barreira noted that even individuals who have been vaccinated for the virus are still at risk of infection.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, mumps outbreaks can occur in communities with high vaccination rates—including college campuses—due to their crowded environments.
The state of Massachusetts requires two doses of the vaccine, which,  according to the CDC, is 88 percent effective at protecting against mumps, yet still leaves a significant possibility of infection. Barreira said in 2016 that 99 percent of undergraduates had been vaccinated against mumps, as proven through mandatory student vaccine documentation.
Harvard students have been faced with a host of uncommon infectious diseases in the past year, including Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Sept. 2017. With the added threat of a particularly intense nationwide flu season, Barreira advised students to practice good hygiene to lower the risk of flu or mumps infection.
“The health and safety of all members of the Harvard community is a top priority, and I want to remind you of simple, preventive measures,” Barreira wrote in his email. “Prevention is centered on good hygiene.”
Barreira listed half a dozen such practices in his email, reminding students to wash their hands, avoid contact with sick individuals, and cough into their elbow, among other suggestions.
Even with good hygiene and preventive practices, mumps has the potential to spread through the air as well as through human-to-human contact, according to the World Health Organization. Infected persons may experience a host of symptoms including facial swelling, jaw pain, ear ache, and testicular swelling.
Barreira concluded his email by encouraging students to call HUHS as soon as possible if they think they might be infected with mumps or the flu, rather than scheduling an appointment or walking in to the clinic.

Astrophysicists at Harvard and five other institutions around the world have developed a new computer simulation of the universe, which researchers said can produce more realistic and higher-resolution models than its predecessors.
Dubbed “Illustris: The Next Generation” (IllustrisTNG), this model has the potential to revolutionize the way scientists study galaxy formation and supermassive black holes, according to Jill P. Naiman, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  Naiman worked on the project alongside her colleague, Astrophysics professor Lars Hernquist.
The research team that developed this model, led by Volker Springel from the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies in Germany, includes researchers from Harvard, MIT, Columbia, and the Max Planck Centers for Astronomy and Astrophysics. “[IllustrisTNG] is this cross-department, cross-institution, cross-country type of collaboration,” Naiman said.
A series of papers published in the Dec. 2017 Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society describes their work. In one of the papers, the researchers wrote that their universe simulation “significantly expands the scope with simulations of larger volumes, at higher resolution, and with new physics.”
Naiman said that IllustrisTNG includes new observational data and allows astrophysicists to study the interactions between large numbers of galaxies instead of analyzing isolated cases.
“The idea is that we now have observations of not just a few galaxies, but thousands to hundreds of thousands of galaxies, and so we can observe statistics of galaxies. We want to be able to simulate those statistics, not just the characteristics of individual galaxies. To do that, we have to run these really big simulations that are of these big ‘cubes’ of our universe, from the beginning of time until now,” Naiman said.
According to Naiman, IllustrisTNG builds on the data used by its predecessor, Illustris, and addresses some of the challenges researchers faced while using the previous model, such as data reproducibility and processing speed.
“I think [IllustrisTNG] ran on something like 24,000 processors, on the fastest computer in Germany,” she said. “These are pretty big, large-scale simulations.”
Naiman explained that the IllustrisTNG model starts with an input of physical parameters, based on a researcher’s area of interest, and uses those parameters to generate simulated data about large-scale processes in the universe.
The beauty of this model, according to Naiman, is its versatility.
“Other people are really interested in things like the observable effects of magnetic fields and radiohalos… You can do a wide variety of different things,” Naiman said.
“I think it’s such a cool idea that we can actually simulate a big portion of the universe from the beginning of time,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s first-ever tenured professor in Native American studies, History professor Philip J. Deloria, began teaching last month, after years of activists calling for Native American studies offerings.
Deloria’s appointment is the culmination of an effort by the Harvard University Native American Program that has been going on “since the mid-2000s,” according to Executive Director Shelly C. Lowe.  Deloria, who is Native American himself, has been working with HUNAP, the University’s main organization for Native American students and faculty, since 2004.
“Phil Deloria is the leading—I was gonna say one of the leading, but he’s really the best —historian of Native Americans active today,” History Department Chair Daniel L. Smail. “We were just really lucky.”
Deloria has been at the University of Michigan’s American Studies department since 2001, but said he is excited to join the “really smart, excellent people” in Harvard’s History department.
“Internally, in terms of Harvard, there’s so many great things happening here. The museums, the libraries, the resources are tremendous for the study of Native Americans and Native American history,” Deloria said.
“To the extent that I can jump into a conversation and advance that conversation, make things more legible and coherent as far as the field, that would be great,” he added.
This semester, Deloria is teaching a graduate seminar on the historiography of Native American and Indigenous Studies, and next semester he will teach an introduction to Native American Studies course primarily for undergraduates.
Deloria, Smail and Lowe all said Deloria’s full professorship is a significant step for Harvard’s Native American curriculum.
“Having a full professor here will legitimize Native American studies coursework here in a way that assistant professors just couldn’t,” Lowe said.
Truman M. Burrage, president of Native Americans of Harvard College, called Professor Deloria’s appointment “incredible,” but also “way overdue.”
Harvard has a long history with Native Americans on its campus. The original Harvard Charter dedicates the school to “the education of the English and Indian youth.”
“Since 1656, there’s been Native American presence on Harvard’s campus,” Burrage said. “But the problem was that after a while it went very dormant, and Harvard became a place for upper class white males to go to school. It took until the 1970s before that was brought back.”
Lowe said that Deloria’s professorship should be a first step toward a larger Native American studies faculty.
“[Deloria’s appointment] gives the sense that this work can be done at Harvard, it is being done at Harvard,” Lowe said. “But this can’t be the end. Harvard needs to hire additional faculty.”
Deloria and Burrage both pointed to Native American languages as another place where Harvard still needs improvement.
“Within our community,” Burrage said, “We feel that if you learn a native language, that should count for the language requirement, but there’s no test. And Harvard’s big thing is that you have to get someone who can administer the test on campus, so that’s a big obstacle in the way.”
Despite the need for further work, Deloria said he is optimistic.
“There’s no institution that has any kind of clean history with Native America, but that doesn’t mean that institutions aren’t capable of redemption. To me, it seems like there’s a lot of people at Harvard who are thinking about this and thinking about it in a good way, and that’s the first step.” Deloria said.
“Can any institution ever fully redeem its history?” he added. “No, it just can’t—it doesn’t happen that way. But it’s better to be trying than not to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most English professors are largely concerned with what’s inside a book, David J. Alworth studies a text’s exterior.
Expanding upon an essay he wrote in 2015, Alworth is writing a book, tentatively titled "The Book Cover: Art at the Edges of Literature," in which he explores topics ranging from the nineteenth history of the book cover to the book cover in the digital era.  The book is scheduled to come out next fall.
While Alworth is writing the book, Peter Mendelsund, Knopf’s Associate Art Director, is designing the book and its cover.  Mendelsund has designed book covers for novels like Kazuo Ishiguro’s "The Buried Giant" and Stieg Larsson’s "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."
Alworth said he became interested in book covers when he invited Mendelsund to design a book cover assignment for students in one of his courses.  Alworth said that he thinks the students dug deeper into the project since it was a creative assignment, and the project concluded with a display.
“We did a display and we talked about the mechanics of translating the verbal text into a visual and physical object, and I thought I’d like to explore this further,” Alworth said.
Alworth and Mendelsund then began their partnership on the book, which covers subjects like the mid-nineteenth century book cover and paratexts.
Paratext, Alworth said, is the “liminal space between the text and the reader,” and is composed not just of the cover art, but of the copyright page, the title page, the dedication, and the end papers as well.
“We develop a critical language for talking about the book covers which comes out of this idea of the paratext,” Alworth said.
Alworth also dedicates a section of the book to culture, in which he examines different book covers for the same text.  He said he is particularly interested in how books, and their covers, move from a domestic stage to an international one.
“How does paratextual art as we call it, or book design, deal with that transition, how does it help to precipitate that transition?” Alworth said.
Alworth mentioned the Swedish novel "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" as an example, saying that both the title and the cover changed as the book reached the global stage.  The book’s previous title, according to Alworth, was roughly translated as “Men Who Hate Women.”
“If you can picture 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' Knopf cover, its neon green, it’s got that swirling tattoo symbol on it, and it’s all text-based, which is completely unconventional,” Alworth said.  “And we’re really interested in the extent to which that visual invention helped to bolster the success of that novel and what role it played in mediating between the domestic function of Nordic noir and the world literature function of Scandinavian crime fiction.”
Alworth also explores the role of the book-cover in the digital era.
“Covers are really interesting because the cover is, in the digital age, at once the image that we associate with the book.  It’s two dimensional, you see it on a screen,” Alworth said.  “I think it’s never been more important in the history of literature.”

UPDATED: February 11, 2018 at 12:35 a.m.
As Harvard Law School celebrates its 200th year Professors and student activists gathered at Harvard Law School Wednesday night to debate the school's reported disconnect with public interest.
The event, titled “Harvard Law and the Public Interest,” revolved largely around a report titled "Our Bicentennial Crisis" by Law student Pete D. Davis ’12. Panelists Randall L. Kennedy, Carol S. Steiker ’82, Duncan Kennedy ’64, and Todd D. Rakoff ’67—all Law School professors—agreed that public interest law is essential for fighting inequality and that the Law School has the power to promote that interest.
“We’re talking about the everyday things of making sure that people get proper treatment for their special needs trial or getting the consumer complaint that they have settled in a fair way. I think those things are very important,” Rakoff said to Davis. “I completely agree with you that the underserving of that kind of everyday legal problem in our society has very corrosive social and political effects.”
Steiker admitted that since the Law School relies largely on alumni donations, it might need to change its financial model in order to encourage students to pursue public interest law, which typically pays less than private law firms.
In response, Davis offered several proposals for how Law School administrators can improve the prevailing culture at the Law School. He also said he supported increasing economic diversity at the school.
“To do that will require opening up the black box of admissions,” Davis said. “I think we should talk about what do we value in admissions and what type of classes do we want to craft.”
But Davis also noted that Law students have an equal responsibility to take action.
“I believe that change happens by everyone participating in a community and this is not something that should just be the administration — you can start things right now,” Davis said. “I think students should — if they believe in this — they should put in the work to start building the culture and prefiguring the culture that they want here.”
Some of the professors argued the Law School already works to promote careers in the public interest. Steiker emphasized that the school offers a “terrific public interest advising office” and “post-graduate fellowships.” Steiker added, though, that the school could and should do more.
For Davis, his report last fall and the event Wednesday were parts of his months-long effort to shift the Law School from what he identifies as a corporate focus to a public interest focus.
“Two years ago, when I was advocating for this as a 1L, people wouldn’t even admit that this was a problem. They would deny that there was a distinction between public interest careers, corporate interest careers,” said Davis.
Davis, who has been working to promote public interest at the Law School for two years, was excited about hosting this event.
“I think that there is a dormant energy at the Law School for more parity between public interest career building and corporate interest career building,” he said. “And I think those conversations have been happening at the Law School in whispers all around and I think this was one of the first events to bring it out into the open and I think people responded well.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarifications:
UPDATED: February 9, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated Law School professor Carol S. Steiker '82 argued the Law School already does enough to promote careers in the public interest. To clarify, Steiker said that, though the school has a "terrific public interest advising office," the Law School could and should do more.
UPDATED: February 11, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated Pete D. Davis '12 proposed increasing public interest involvement at the Law School by "increasing economic diversity." To clarify, Davis only said increasing economic diversity at the Law School would be a good thing in and of itself; he did not explicitly say that increasing economic diversity comprises a means to increase public interest involvement.

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said he will work with faculty to develop new courses as students wait for the postponed Program in General Education requirements to take effect.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to students last month that the new system of General Education requirements will be rolled out in 2019 instead of 2018 as originally planned. In an interview last month, administrative director of the General Education program Stephanie H. Kenen said that designing the program’s new courses “is taking longer than we thought it might.”
The new program will replace one that is “failing on a variety of fronts,” according to a 2015 report on the General Education program. Current freshmen and sophomores will graduate under the new requirements but may use current General Education courses to fulfill their requirements.
Smith said in an interview Wednesday that his role has focused on recruiting faculty to teach these new General Education courses. He said he is looking for faculty who will be able to tap into the conversations that students have in the dining halls and bring them to the classroom.
“One of the first things I'm looking for is a faculty member that can take a subject matter and make sure that they're starting out with something that grabs your attention as undergraduates,” Smith said.
Smith also said he will seek faculty who will ask students to “engage in the world.”
“I want this to be an active learning discussion, and not passive,” Smith said. He added that the best outcome for a General Education course would be one that takes advantage of the “diversity across our student body.”
With new courses, Smith said that he hopes to find more chances for interdisciplinary developments. He said he is open to the idea of faculty from different divisions co-teaching in the new General Education courses.
“I think it's an opportunity for us to teach across disciplinary boundaries and these topics lend themselves tremendously to, if it hasn't already, at least two or three areas,” Smith said. “So how can we enable that?”
The new General Education program requires students to take one class in each of four categories: Aesthetics & Culture; Histories, Societies, Individuals; Science & Technology in Society; and Ethics & Civics. Students will also need to fulfill three divisional requirements in the Humanities, Social Sciences, Sciences or SEAS, and an additional course that “demonstrates quantitative faculty.”
Smith also said that the details surrounding the quantitative requirement have yet to be specified.
“Personally, I don't worry too much about the categories,” Smith said. “It's not how I'm approaching the curriculum.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana applauded the Hasty Pudding Theatricals for its decision to cast women starting fall 2018 in an interview last Friday, noting the move came at the “right time.”
During its 2018 Woman of the Year festivities honoring Mila Kunis in late January, the Pudding announced it would break with nearly 200 years of tradition and welcome women to join its cast next fall. The decision came hours after Kunis phoned at least one member of the Pudding’s graduate board to discuss the move.
The switch to co-ed also comes at a moment when administrators have resolved to sanction members of unrecognized single-gender social groups. The College’s social group penalties—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships.
Khurana commended both undergraduate and graduate members of the troupe for the historic policy reversal in the interview Friday.
“I want to congratulate the student leadership and the alumni who recognized that this was the right time and it’s an important step,” he said.
Asked how the Pudding’s decision fits into the College’s ongoing implementation of its social group policies, Khurana said his ultimate goal is to create an environment that fosters “a sense of belonging and inclusion” for all undergraduates.
He added this goal applies to both recognized and unrecognized student organizations; the Pudding falls under the former category.
“Our hope is that this is something that all student organizations take into account, whether they’re recognized or unrecognized,” Khurana said.
Khurana said the College did not coordinate the group’s decision, but that what he called the student-led push to make the Pudding’s cast gender-neutral shows some Harvard undergraduates are now seeking more inclusive spaces. Since 2015, undergraduate women unsuccessfully sought to audition for the Pudding’s cast each year in protest of the all-male policy.
In previous interviews—and again on Friday—Khurana cited student sentiment and support as a major reason Harvard must work to become more open and welcoming to undergraduates of all genders and races. Khurana has said he thinks the College’s penalties comprise an important step toward accomplishing that goal.
“When given the opportunity to choose spaces that [are] more inclusive our students lean in that direction,” Khurana said Friday. “It seems to me those are the kinds of places they’re attracted to.”
During the interview, Khurana also seemed to particularly tie the Pudding’s decision to go co-ed to what he sees as a wave of student leadership following in the wake of the College’s sanctions.
Asked Friday which groups on campus may be subject to the penalties, Khurana did not directly respond and instead mentioned that a range of organizations are now opting to go co-ed.
“I’m hearing about organizations with musical backgrounds and stuff reconsidering how they did [things]—and artistic organizations, not just in our university but other places as well,” Khurana said.
In addition to the Pudding, some other college performing arts groups have also recently chosen to abandon their single-gender status. In Sept. 2016, a woman received a callback for Harvard’s historically all-male Krokodiloes a capella group for the first time. And at Yale, historically all-male a capella groups Wiffenpoofs and Whim ’n Rhythm announced last week they would consider admitting hopefuls of all genders, despite their historically single-gender status.
Khurana said the Pudding’s decision means the “criteria that matter,” rather than past traditions, will determine who can participate in the cast.
Following the announcement, women across Harvard said they planned to audition for the Pudding’s cast next semester.
“This changes the whole game,” said Chloe Saracco ’21, who intends to try out next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traffic in Harvard Square will become even slower starting in March, when Cambridge will see its second speed limit decrease in a year and a half.
At a public celebration Thursday morning, the City of Cambridge unveiled its Vision Zero Action Plan to improve transportation safety. The plan includes a speed limit reduction to 20 miles per hour in squares with heavy traffic like Harvard Square.
The Vision Zero strategy, which was unanimously adopted by the City Council in 2016, seeks to ensure zero casualties and injuries due to traffic accidents. To accomplish this goal, the action plan outlines seven “high-level” commitments, according to Brooke M. McKenna, the city’s assistant director for street management.
The seven main goals seek to design and operate safe streets; improve large vehicle, taxi, and app ride safety; ensure equity in safety efforts; engage with the public; ensure city employees lead by example; create new partnerships with local institutions; and use data to direct efforts and measure progress.
In accordance with the new plan, the city lowered the speed limits in squares from 25 miles per hour to 20 miles per hour. According to McKenna, the squares in Cambridge are the center of economic and pedestrian activity.
“We really think lowering the speed limits there will be most effective and have a great direct impact on pedestrians to enjoy the most vital parts of our city,” McKenna said.
This new reduction in the  speed  limit comes after the city approved a policy order in 2016 that already lowered the speed limits across Cambridge from 30 mph to 25 mph.
Since the lower speed limits were implemented in 2016, preliminary data from the Cambridge Police Department shows a three percent reduction in crash calls, the lowest level in nearly two decades according to a public release.
Cambridge has recently placed emphasis on transportation safety in the wake of several fatal bike crashes. Other changes to city streets include more defined bike-only lanes and improvements to existing bike infrastructure.
In addition to reducing the number of traffic accidents, lower speed limits have the potential to reduce the severity of crashes if they were to occur, McKenna said.
“Studies have shown for a pedestrian that gets hit by a vehicle going 30 miles per hour, they have a one in 10 chance of survival. When the speed goes down to 20 miles per hour, those numbers flip—they have a nine in 10 chance of survival,” McKenna said.
As Cambridge continues to pursue other initiatives with the Vision Zero Action Plan, the city hopes to engage with local institutions like neighboring cities, employers, and universities, McKenna said.
“Harvard is fully supportive of the City’s efforts to enhance the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists in the Square,” University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email.
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux said that she hopes Cambridge can serve as an example of how Vision Zero can be implemented.
“If we say we want to be a leader, then we do need to be a leader,” Devereux said. “We need to be able to really wrestle the balancing act between equitable sharing of the streets and safety and public health and mobility.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sally C. Donahue, the College’s financial aid director, will retire in August. Throughout the 18 years she’s held the position, and three decades working at Harvard, she’s earned admiration from colleagues at the University and across the country.
In her tenure as Director of Financial Aid, Donahue oversaw the office as it launched the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative in 2004. Under her leadership, the office’s budget has approximately doubled—an improvement which financial aid office staff say now ensures a Harvard education is affordable for all families.
Donahue’s achievements with the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative extend beyond Harvard, her colleagues say. Introduced in 2004, the initiative stipulates that families earning less than $65,000 a year pay nothing toward their child’s cost of attendance. Twenty percent of students get their tuition covered entirely, and more than half of College students receive some financial aid.
“These changes not only revolutionized Harvard, but really have revolutionized and made much more open and accessible private higher education throughout the United States,” Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said.
Outside of Harvard, Donahue has been involved with a variety of financial aid initiatives, earning her national recognition.
Donahue has served as chair of the College Board’s Financial Aid Standards and Services Committee, and as a committee member of its Task Force on Admissions in the 21st Century and its College Scholarship Council.
“Not only do I think she's the nation's best and most respected financial aid officer, she has been active in all of the national financial aid organizations,” Fitzsimmons said.
“She really is a towering figure in the national financial aid scene, and even internationally,” he added.
Anne Sturtevant, executive director of higher education initiatives at the College Board, has worked closely with Donahue and described her as “a big thinker,” “a collaborator,” and “one of those quiet leaders.”
She added that Donahue’s perspective is particularly valuable due to her adept sensitivity to how resources vary among academic institutions.
“She really tries to make sure that whatever she’s trying to communicate [is] as relatable as possible to a broad swath of institutions and campuses,” Sturtevant said.
In his email to admissions and financial aid office employees announcing Donahue’s retirement, Fitzsimmons lauded her contributions to the University and noted how she has earned a reputation for being exceptionally kind.
“We know when Sally is free at any time of day, and she has her door open so that we can go in and talk to her,” Charlene S. Kim, an assistant director of financial aid and a senior admissions officer, said. “Having worked in a lot of places, that’s very rare.”
Sturtevant said students and colleagues alike find Donahue relatable and approachable.
“I think people enjoy her personally because she's very approachable, she's warm, she has a very unpretentious presence,” Sturtevant said.
In a field that requires much interpersonal interaction, Fitzsimmons said Donahue’s personability motivates those she works with.
“She is five of the nicest people, all in one person, that you'd ever want to meet,” Fitzsimmons said. “That permeates the entire financial aid staff. She's a great role model to people.”
Donahue said she loves her job, in part, because it challenges her in new ways every day. Her daily routine is filled with meetings and phone calls scheduled one after another.  Any time in between she uses to connect with colleagues.
“I love change,” she said of her fast-paced schedule. “This has been a fundamental piece of my experience here: having to know what my priorities are and having to keep in mind that students come first.”
Donahue said another perk of being at Harvard is all the people she’s encountered over the years. She said getting to know students, especially by reading their applications, is among the highlights of the job.
“I actually learn, always, from reading admissions files,” Donahue said. “Students come in with knowledge that I have not been exposed to before. So I’m constantly looking things up, trying to figure out, ‘What does that word mean? What is this discipline, this field of study?’ It’s really interesting.”
Though she’s made the difficult decision to step down from her position as director, Donahue said she has no intention of leaving 86 Brattle St. anytime soon. She has plans to continue reading admissions files and fundraising. Nor is she cutting short her goals for the future of Harvard’s financial aid program.
“I’d love to see the program endowed fully,” Donahue said. “It would be my ‘blue sky’ issue.”
Donahue said she hopes to use her experience at Harvard to work more closely with high school students in New England.  She is considering volunteering her time to connect with high school students or to advise administrators. A shortened commute might be an added benefit, she said.
“There are so many different ways I feel I could continue to contribute in a way that’s unencumbered by a full workday here and a ride on the Southeast Expressway north and south,” Donahue said.
A lighter administrative workload will also give Donahue the flexibility to spend time with her grandchildren on a regular basis.
Still, she says stepping down will be bittersweet.
“I feel incredibly honored to have had this position. It’s really like no other financial aid director position in the country,” she said.

Speaking softly in a small, dark studio on the tenth floor of the School of Public Health’s Kresge Building, United States Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams did not soften the statistics.
“Four people will die from overdoses in the time that we’re having this conversation today,” Adams told the audience of roughly 50 students, physicians, and researchers, all gathered on campus Jan. 25 to hear him discuss the opioid epidemic currently sweeping the country.
Nationwide, an average of 115 people die every day due to opioid overdoses. The epidemic—which began around 2013 and 2014, according to data compiled by the New York Times—has hit rural New England and Appalachian communities particularly hard.  Opioid addiction and overdose in the U.S. is now so pervasive it claims the lives of more Americans every year than do car accidents.
For Adams, the issue is personal: His brother, Phillip, has struggled with substance abuse and is currently incarcerated for related charges. Adams detailed his brother’s story at the event in January. He also urged attendees to do their part to stop the deaths.
“I challenge you to think of one thing that you can do to help respond to the epidemic,” Adams said. “Because we’re not going to be able to solve this problem from Washington, D.C.”
At least some in the audience were listening. Whether or not lawmakers on Capitol Hill are making progress, researchers and educators in Longwood—home to Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health—have decided to take matters into their own hands.
As the opioid epidemic rages, Harvard researchers and educators are working to better understand the phenomenon and to teach students how to fight against it. Harvard faculty across the University’s Longwood campus are ramping up efforts to research the epidemic and are offering more classes on how to treat patients affected by addiction.
Harvard affiliates say University research into the opioid epidemic takes multiple forms, stretching from analyzing the driving forces behind the spike in deaths and overdoses to determining how to best treat addicted patients.
The factors behind the dramatic rise in opioid overdoses in recent years remain unclear, but Harvard professors with expertise in the field say they have identified some likely candidates.
Zirui Song, assistant professor of healthcare policy at the Medical School, has published at least two studies about opioids. His research leads him to believe possible causes of the epidemic include “availability of opioids, the delivery system, and factors associated with prescribing,” he wrote in an email.
But efforts to understand the epidemic are not circumscribed to the lab. The Medical School’s relationship with teaching hospitals allows Harvard professors to bring together research and practice, according to Laura G. Kehoe, an assistant professor at the Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Kehoe runs the Bridge Clinic at MGH, an on-demand clinic for at-risk patients.
She said many traditional substance-abuse treatment programs are “very regimented and really inaccessible to patients.” At her clinic, she has been working to develop a more flexible treatment model that takes into account each patient’s individual needs.
This model has significantly reduced the number of patients who do not show up to appointments, according to Kehoe. She said the system promises to help reduce opioid overdose and widespread drug usage.
Even as treatments improve, though, Harvard researchers say two things still bar the path to a comprehensive approach to the epidemic: lack of knowledge and public stigma surrounding addiction.
Robert Blendon, a professor at the School of Public Health, has extensively researched popular views of the opioid epidemic. Blendon directs the Harvard Opinion Research Program, an initiative that examines public opinion on health and social policy in the U.S. as well as nearly 30 other countries.
Blendon calls public ignorance “a central finding” that is “incredibly important” to the work of everyone at the Medical School and the School of Public Health.
“Half of Americans don’t know if there’s a treatment that even works, and half of them don’t think insurance should pay for it,” he said.
Blendon said beliefs like these mean more extensive education efforts are necessary across the country in order to make clear effective treatment programs already exist.
Kehoe agreed, adding that shame can also prevent those suffering from addiction from seeking treatment. She said this stigma can come from the general public, from healthcare providers, from family members, and even from the patients themselves.
“One of the biggest challenges is stigma,” Kehoe said.
In addition to more deeply researching the epidemic, Harvard faculty have also begun to offer classes to better educate students about opioid abuse and substance abuse disorder.
Medical faculty have teamed up to teach two online classes about opioid and substance abuse. One of them, “The Opioid Crisis in America,” appears on the edX platform, a virtual education initiative Harvard and MIT founded in 2012.  A team of six Harvard faculty members are offering the second, titled “Understanding Addiction,” through the Medical School’s Global Academy and in conjunction with the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Both courses debuted last year.
David H. Roberts, dean for external education at the Medical School, wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard faculty “recognized the opportunity to provide information and resources to patients, families and clinicians.”
According to Roberts, nearly 15,000 students have enrolled in “The Opioid Crisis in America” on HarvardX to date. The course is designed to enable students to select the modules that best address their needs.
The University has also brought several high-profile speakers to campus to discuss the opioid epidemic with students and faculty. Last month, Adams spoke at the School of Public Health in an event that formed part of the school’s Voices in Leadership program  In Oct. 2017, Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 spoke to students at the Medical School as part of a faculty panel.
Harvard’s efforts are not confined to its Longwood Campus. Blendon said he also has taught students and policymakers at the Kennedy School about public opinion surrounding the opioid epidemic.
The Kennedy School hosted an event centered on the spike in overdoses last March, titled “Examining America’s Opioid Crisis” and co-led by former Vermont governor Peter Shumlin.
The Medical School course catalogue lists several elective classes covering addiction and substance abuse. The courses center on topics ranging from the psychiatry of substance abuse disorder to appropriate clinical management.
After graduation, students can study the practical treatment of opioid addiction as they fulfill their residency requirements. Song wrote he has often used residency as an opportunity for “clinical teaching around opioid use and withdrawal.”
Kehoe said these offerings form a departure from the traditional medical school curriculum. She said typical class schedules did not give students the opportunity to learn about addiction and substance abuse disorder.
“I had to seek out my own education through mentors because there was no formal training then,” she said of her time in medical school and during residency.
Still, the Medical School has not mandated opioid education classes for its students. And HMS was not one of the 61 medical schools that signed a March 2016 White House pledge to include prescriber education in their curriculums.
Kehoe said working to address issues surrounding the opioid epidemic—and addiction more broadly—can sometimes be challenging and frustrating. But she said she always finds a reason to keep coming back to her clinic.
“The reason why this work is so rewarding and the reason why those of us who do this love it is that we see people get better every day, and this is a very treatable illness,” she said.

students opposed to unionization cited disparities in resources between Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers and students critical of the union as one of their top concerns in the upcoming second unionization election in April.
HGSU-UAW opponents argued that United Automobile Workers’ backing gives the student union an unfair advantage in its efforts to convince eligible students to support unionization. HGSU-UAW officially partnered with the UAW, which is also affiliated with graduate unions at Columbia and NYU, in 2015.
Though there is no formal organization representing students who oppose HGSU-UAW, some students who are against unionization participate in a loosely organized group, “Against HGSU-UAW.”
Physics graduate student Jae Hyeon Lee, who created the group, said the lack of institutional representation makes it difficult to reach out to potential voters and counter HGSU-UAW’s arguments.
“A primary challenge for those who oppose the unionization is that we don't have all the financial, time, and human resources the UAW provides to its supporters to effectively communicate with other students at large,” Lee wrote in an email.
“The union has an essentially unlimited and privileged access to our contacts whereas that's clearly [not] the case for an average student with an opposing view due to a general lack of institutional representation.”
Mark R. Lipstein, a graduate student in biological and biomedical sciences who also opposes HGSU-UAW’s organizing efforts, said he disagreed with the decision to hold a new election. The National Labor Relations Board ordered the second election after accepting HGSU-UAW’s objections over the accuracy of the University-generated eligible voter list for the original Nov. 2016 election.
University attorneys had argued in proceedings before the NLRB that HGSU-UAW’s ability to contact eligible voters was not hampered by potential errors in the voter list.
“What amazed me and others was the fact that the NLRB was ignorant of the vast imbalance of organizational and monetary resources the UAW is imbued with,” Lipstein said.
Lipstein also criticized the unionization effort for a lack of communication with graduate students about its financial ties to the national UAW. If pro-unionization students prevail in April’s election, all graduate students will become part of the bargaining unit, regardless of their position on the union. Graduate students would nonetheless have to vote to approve any contracts negotiated by HGSU-UAW after unionizing.
“No one has any idea how they plan to actually spend the money we will all be forced to contribute,” Lipstein said. “They have shown some sketchy pie charts showing that a significant portion of money collected goes to the national UAW, so, in effect, do they stand to profit off of unionizing new schools?”
Benjamin Z. A. Green, a graduate student in computer science and HGSU-UAW organizer, wrote in an email that the union has been “transparent as possible” in articulating the purpose of the graduate student union’s financial ties with UAW.
“Thus far, the resources from the UAW have primarily gone toward a couple causes. The first is paying student organizers—these are grad students who spend 20+ hours per week away from their own research in order to support a union that will improve the lives of Harvard’s graduate student body,” Green wrote.
“The second was challenging Harvard’s disenfranchisement of hundreds of eligible voters in last fall’s election. Without the UAW’s resources, we never would have been able to challenge Harvard's violations of labor law so that we could have a new and fairer election this spring,” Green added.
Green cited HGSU-UAW’s advocacy for international students and lobbying against the proposed tuition waiver tax as examples of the need for affiliating with a larger national organization.
“This helped us defeat the GOP grad tax, it helps us advocate for stronger protections for international students, and it makes us stronger when we face new national challenges going forward,” Green wrote.

UPDATED: February 9, 2018
Due to an editing error, a previous caption accompanying a photo included in this story incorrectly asserted that Wednesday marks the first day of voting on whether the graduate students will form a union. In fact, that vote took place several months ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

We’re going to play a game called ‘Who Said it?’. It’s a pretty simple concept, we’re going to give you a quote and you’re going to guess who said it. Here we go.
“The whole reason why I keep talking about the Eagles is because I feel like it totally translates to what this team is going through.”
Do you have your guess?
In case you’ve been living under a rock for the last week, Philadelphia is home to the Lombardi Trophy. Let that one sink in for a second. This article is being written on a train from Philadelphia following a parade to celebrate the Eagles’ first ever Super Bowl.
‘Was the quote from Millville, N.J., native and noted Eagles fan Mike Trout? He was at the Super Bowl on Sunday and his Angels team figures to contend for a World Series following a down year last season.’
No on the Trout guess. Millions of people took the streets on a Thursday afternoon when center Jason Kelce delivered an expletive-laden speech about being an underdog. A team that lost three of its top players to injury, was led by a man who was rated the 32nd-best coach in the NFL before the season, and scored two offensive touchdowns between Christmas and the NFC Championship Game brought Philadelphia its first Super Bowl, defeating Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in the process.
‘So, did Villanova coach Jay Wright deliver the quote? His team knows a little bit about knocking off a powerhouse on the big stage and was the last team from the Philadelphia area to have a parade.’
It wasn’t Wright. Philadelphia doesn’t typically win things, but its teams also don’t stink to the point where there are no expectations. Philadelphia sports teams are good at being just good enough for fans to have hope and then they rip your heart out.
In December, it appeared as though the Eagles were well on their way to another season of heartbreak. After leading his team to the best record in football and perhaps an MVP award for himself in the process, second-year quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a torn ACL in what was perhaps one of the most “Philadelphia” injuries of all-time.
‘Then was the quote from Chester, Pa., native Tyreke Evans, who lost his Memphis Grizzlies teammate Mike Conley to season-ending surgery on his heel late last month?’
Good guess but no. A mere five weeks after Wentz’s backup, Nick Foles, threw for 39 yards in the first half of a 6-0 home loss to the Cowboys, the Eagles were basking in the glory of a Super Bowl while their fans were wreaking havoc on the nation’s fifth-largest city. The whole thing felt surreal. Heck, Rocky, the city’s most iconic sports movie is about a boxer who (spoiler alert) ends up losing. In addition to the game story that it wrote on Monday morning, The New York Times published a piece chronicling how Philadelphia has an identity crisis, going from perennial losers and underdogs to champions during the Eagles’ improbable Super Bowl run. The Philadelphia Inquirer ran an article about how the Eagles’ run was ushering in a golden era of Philadelphia sports.
What about 76ers coach Brett Brown? Many people think his young team will be the next one from Philadelphia to hoist a trophy.
While he and Eagles coach Doug Pederson are good friends, the quote does not belong to Brown. Let me give you a hint. The person who said the quote plays for a Philadelphia sports team that currently holds a longer win streak than the Eagles. The quote at the beginning of the article comes from Penn junior Jake Silpe, a reserve point guard from Cherry Hill, N.J.
Silpe may not have been your first guess, but his team is hot. In fact, the Penn men’s basketball team is red hot. The Quakers have won four straight contests and are the Ivy League’s last remaining unbeaten team. Penn coach Steve Donahue has orchestrated a renaissance of Quaker basketball quicker than many experts predicted. After four straight losing seasons and an 0-6 start to Ivy League play a season ago, Penn has won 12 of its last 14 Ancient Eight contests. The Quakers came the closest of any Ivy League team to taking down last year’s undefeated Princeton squad and have already beaten the Tigers twice this season and title contender Yale last weekend. Penn is averaging nearly 77 points per contest and has already won nine games decided by nine or fewer points.
However, this article is not to draw parallels between a team that just won a Super Bowl in historic fashion to a team that had back-to-back losses to Fairfield and La Salle earlier in the season. Yes, the Quakers have been playing the best basketball of anyone in the Ivy League and looked dominant in the second half against Princeton on Tuesday night.
But there’s still a lot of basketball to be played and even more questions to be answered. Penn has played just one road game in the last two months, has struggled at times to play defense, is just over a year removed from a weekend in which it dropped its road contests to Harvard and Dartmouth, its two opponents this weekend, and has an extremely creepy (but peaceful) mascot.
Yes, the Penn men’s basketball team and the Eagles both finished below .500 last season and yes, Steve Donahue and Doug Pederson look alike if you cover one eye and squint, and yes, both teams play in the same city. The Quakers will probably beat Harvard this weekend, but come on, it’s still Penn men’s basketball. On to the picks:
COLUMBIA AT YALE
Both of these institutions struggle to have redeeming qualities.
For its part, Columbia has what may very well be the worst band in collegiate sports. On our road trip to Morningside Heights last week, we had the misfortune of being placed right in front of the band. After a few mediocre renditions of some traditional melodies, the band—which endearingly refers to itself as “the maggots of Columbia College” in its constitution—decided to take on Taylor Swift’s “I Knew You Were Trouble”.
We wish they hadn’t.
If you’ve ever had the fortunate of seeing that video where they replace the “oh’s” in that song with goats screaming, that’s a lot what it sounded like. If you haven’t, just Google “Taylor Swift goat” and turn up the volume.
Reading further into the band’s constitution, we found some language that explained it all—the band will, “take anyone who shows up.” I guess they took a page out of the playbook of Cornell’s admissions office.
For its part, Yale is located in New Haven.
The reason for all this is to say that with their lack of enviable qualities, this should make for a pretty close matchup. Given that the Lions won’t have their trusted band in New Haven, though, it’ll be tough for them to find the inspiration necessary out in Connecticut.
Pick: Yale
CORNELL AT BROWN
While Cornell struggles to earn any semblance of respect from its Ivy League counterparts, another Ithaca institution has done just that for us.
That’s right, the Ithaca Police Department.
On our way in and out of Ithaca, the police department had the fortune of stopping our noble steed—a Dodge Grand Caravan—not once, but twice for what may or may not have been speeding. After some casual conversation and an “I’d rather not know” in reference to a “Do you know how fast you were going?”, neither stop resulted in a ticket.
Incredible.
For its part, Brown is referred to in the Columbia Marching Band constitution as “a bunch of ice skating hippies, but at least Sue made out with one of them on a snow penis.”
We don’t know who Sue is nor do we know why the Ithaca Police Department passed up on two tickets. What we do know is that Brown might be one of the best young teams in the conference.
Pick: Brown
PRINCETON AT HARVARD
“I don’t know how you draw it up any worse than that.”
Those were Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s words following this game last year.
You can hardly blame him—the Crimson lost this one despite being up three with the ball with 34 seconds to go. We won’t delve into the details, but needless to say, mistakes were made.
Harvard then lost to the Tigers on the road courtesy of a last second buzzer-beater.
Even though it plays an undefeated Penn squad on Saturday, this might be a bigger matchup for the Crimson and rightfully so.
Pick: Harvard
PENN AT DARTMOUTH
Fun fact: Dartmouth has lost all but one of its conference games by 10 or fewer points. It also lost its best player, who rightfully decided to transfer after the Big Green got an atrocious new logo.
Nonetheless, a winless conference record doesn’t buy you much in this league.
It buys even less against the only undefeated team in conference.
Pick: Penn
COLUMBIA AT BROWN
We’re not done with the Columbia Marching Band and the Columbia Marching Band isn’t done with Brown. In Article 8.5 of its constitution, the band states, “Brown is a bunch of stoners, but at least Dan boned the drum major.”
Unfortunately, we don’t think Dan—or Columbia for that matter—will be the one doing the boning this weekend.
Pick: Brown
PRINCETON AT DARTMOUTH
This has absolutely nothing to do with this matchup, but neither do most of the things that we write about here.
The people over at The Dartmouth (a newspaper, we think) are really good at taking quotes out of context and then writing a thousand words on said misquote. One of us (we won’t say who but his name is Troy) wrote a column last week on how this might be the easiest road to the tournament Harvard has had in a while.
The column read, “if I was a betting man, I’d take Harvard to finish with the best record in conference.”
What did The Dartmouth write?
“[T]he article did not mention the Crimson’s shooting struggles, instead arguing that Harvard would ‘finish with the best record in conference’”
We couldn’t care less, honestly. Dartmouth has lost nine in a row, so we’re surprised anyone is taking any interest in that team. But at least include the full quote. Our attornies will be in touch.
Did we mention Dartmouth has lost nine in a row?
Pick: Princeton
PENN AT HARVARD
This might just be the championship matchup at the Palestra come March.
With Penn’s 17-point blowout of Princeton and with the Crimson’s loss to Columbia last week, it’s clear that Penn is the team to beat in conference this season. With Bryce Aiken potentially sidelined again for Harvard and definitely not close to fully healthy, it would be hard to make a case for the Crimson. Good for the Quakers.
Pick: Penn
CORNELL AT YALE
We don’t know who names things out in Ithaca but whoever decided to call Cornell’s cheer squad the “Big Red Cheerleaders” clearly didn’t run it by anyone else.
More than anything, it sounds like the kind of phrase an American would use to describe a communist supporter at the height of the Cold War.
The Berlin Wall might’ve fallen, but we doubt Yale will.
Pick: Yale

It was a normal night at the A.D. Club when Ryan Donato reached for his vibrating phone. The call was from the late Jim Johannson, senior U.S.A. Hockey executive and then-general manager for the 2018 American Olympic squad. What happened next changed the junior forward’s career—and life—forever.
“I was next to [senior forward] Seb Lloyd,” Donato recalled. “He was like, ‘Was that what I think it just was?’”
Yes, Seb. It was. Sitting in the A.D., one of Harvard's all-male final clubs, Ryan first heard the news he would officially represent team U.S.A. in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games. All Donato could do was thank Johannson for the opportunity of a lifetime and beg Lloyd not to divulge the secret.
Wearing your country’s colors ranks among the highest possible distinctions an athlete can earn. For Donato, the sheer rarity of the opportunity makes it that much sweeter. For the first time since 1994, the National Hockey League is forbidding its players from competing in the Olympics. This decision, while widely unpopular among fans of the league, has opened the door for skaters not otherwise in contention for a roster spot, namely overseas professionals and American players with minor-league-only contracts.
Johannson and team U.S.A. head coach Tony Granato did, however, dip into the college ranks to round out the roster for the 2018 Games. And that’s where the timing of the NHL ban worked in Donato’s favor.
“It’s honestly a blessing. I think about it every day,” Donato said. “[The NHL’s decision] could have been... four years ago when I wasn’t even considered. Or it could’ve happened four years from now…. I’m extremely blessed to be able to have this opportunity and just have all the dominoes fall in the right place.”
This is not to say the junior hasn’t earned a spot on this year’s team—his 21 goals lead the country, and he left for South Korea as a major contender for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the top National Collegiate Athletic Association player of the year. But recent history depicts a clear trend, and this trend typically doesn’t bode well for current college players with Olympic aspirations.
America’s last five rosters have been occupied entirely by NHL players, and the last time a Harvard iceman represented U.S.A. Hockey in the Games while still in school came in 1992, when Ted Drury ’93 donned the red, white, and blue. So the league’s absence from the Games this year formed just the stroke of luck Donato needed to cash in on his stellar play to date in the NCAA season.
Incidentally, Drury wasn’t the only Ted of note on that team, which placed fourth in Albertville, France. Ted Donato ’91, Ryan’s father and coach for the Crimson, also skated for the stars and stripes that year at the outset of his 796-game NHL career. Coach Donato said he thinks his son's opportunity is once-in-a-lifetime.
“I don’t think anybody really knew how [the roster] might shake out,” said the part-time bench boss, part-time dad. “[But] when we started to hear from some U.S.A. Hockey people that this is not going to be an NHL team...it started to become a little bit clearer and a little bit more of a reality.”
In short, even the greatest college hockey players haven’t had the Olympics on their radar in over two decades. That all changed late in the summer of 2017. Without guaranteeing anything, Johannson hinted that Donato was in the mix for a USA roster spot, and this entirely altered the mindset of the Boston Bruins prospect.
Johannson's advice was simple: play your best, try not to worry about the Olympics quite yet. If it happens, it happens. Johannson reiterated, though, that U.S.A. Hockey would be watching.
“I think I’m on the list for sure,” Donato said in an interview in October, discussing his situation. “I’ve been talking to some of their staff, but... what they’ve told me is just focus on your season."
"My tryout is how I play at the beginning of the season and how I play up until February," he added.
Donato’s play early on in the campaign comprised a convincing start. The Scituate, Mass., native inked the score sheet in each of his first 14 contests and kept the Harvard offense afloat after graduation eliminated one of the team’s forward ranks. 
Another element key to Donato’s season, as far as his parents and U.S.A. Hockey are concerned, has been the junior’s clean bill of health. Coach Donato said he could breathe a sigh of relief after his son boarded the plane to PyeongChang in one piece.
“I was so excited for him that I was worried that he might get hurt before he even makes it over there,” coach Donato said. “I thought that would be just such a hard pill to swallow that I was really hoping and praying that that would not be the case.”
In this way, Donato can already check off step one of his Olympic journey. But he and his father would argue that this journey started well before this season.
Growing up the son of an NHL player, Ryan “always knew” he wanted to play hockey. The game left an indelible mark on his childhood, whether through watching games on TV or running around arenas where his father played—though, as coach Donato pointed out, back then he was less focused on his father’s game and more intent on fooling around with the other players’ sons.
Despite much of his focus necessarily being on the ice, the elder Donato noticed his son’s budding love for hockey and embraced it.
“We actually have video of him when he’s just... two years old, and people are asking him what his name is, and he refers to himself as ‘Ryan Hockeynato,’” coach Donato said. “And he loved to watch the goalies [on TV] so much that he used to drink out of his bottle when the goalie drank out of his bottle.”
Ryan was eager to hone the skills required for high-level hockey, so he threw himself into the game. After successful stints at Dexter School, the Massachusetts Selects Hockey League’s Cape Cod Whalers program, and the United States under-18 national team, he was drafted by the Boston Bruins in the second round. A future in hockey had started to crystalize.
“It’s something you always hope for,” coach Donato said. “Ryan was always one of the standouts on his team...but [special talent] is really hard to see [in advance].... By the time he was 15, 16, 17, he really started to show signs that he might be able to have a future playing hockey.”
Since his freshman year at Harvard, Donato has won a bronze medal with the American team at the 2016 World Junior Championships and has skated alongside some talented linemates, including now-NHL forward Alexander Kerfoot ’17.
And while he has donned multiple jerseys over the course of his young career, Donato has practically grown to expect a blood relative behind the bench. In some form or another, a family member has been barking hockey instructions at the junior since since his first year at Dexter, where his uncle Danny still coaches.
Both unable and unwilling to skirt his Harvard obligations to follow Ryan’s Olympic play, coach Donato said he is looking forward to finally playing just the father again.
“I’m trying to help in any way I can, but ultimately, I’m really just there to support him,” coach Donato said.
He couldn't quite prevent himself from  sharing some nuggets of advice, though, given his own experience at the international level.
“I tried to get him excited about the idea of being part of the US Olympic team, not just the Olympic hockey team,” coach Donato said. “You want him to appreciate the other athletes, the other great stories, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that he’ll have to meet other people.”
Ryan himself has seen the impression that professional hockey—in particular, international competition—has made on his father’s life. Donato will thus heed his father's advice in hopes of finding an experience as meaningful as his father's this February.
“What he’s kept on saying to me [is] that what’s important is the people behind the game,” Ryan said. “Those are the kind of people that you’re best friends with for the rest of your life…. You’re lucky enough to have that chance.”
Hockey is—and always has been—one of the most significant parts of the junior’s life. In this respect, he is certainly following his father’s footsteps. The game has been so integral that it was almost strange for Ryan to articulate its typically unspoken importance.
“Hockey is... ” he paused, as if searching for the right words. “Everything for me. My family’s connected to hockey, my school life’s connected to hockey, my religious life is connected to hockey."
"If I didn’t have hockey, I’d be a completely different person," he added.
Pyeongchang marks simply the next chapter in a life dedicated to hockey. Donato is preparing to author these pages, and while there are no current NHLers on the Olympic team, there’s much to be gained from playing with experienced pros.
“Being the young guy on the team... I really can’t pick,” Ryan said when asked which teammate he’s most looking forward to playing with. “[Captain Brian] Gionta’s one of them, obviously, [James] Wisniewski, those guys that have played a lot of NHL games. All these guys have so much experience in their leagues and wherever they play.... I’m excited to meet everybody.”
For now, it is not totally clear how coach Granato, normally the bench boss at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, plans to use Donato. Anyone’s best guess is that the 6’0” centerman, who will likely play wing in the Olympic tournament, will assume the role of offensive spark plug on a team that may lack some firepower.
“I’ve talked to coach Granato a handful of times,” Ryan said. “He’s a great coach, I can already tell. He’s going to be a lot of fun to play for... I think he wants me to be a guy... creating chances, scoring goals hopefully.”
Adding to Donato’s excitement, he said he has received congratulations from the usual family, friend, and high school cohorts. But more unique, perhaps, are the words shared by Vice President Mike Pence, who will lead the American delegation at the Olympics. Earlier in the week, Pence penned a letter to Donato and his town of Scituate offering his congratulations.
Any reservations Donato may have about his youth are mitigated by the fact that three other college players will suit up alongside him. Among them are St. Cloud State defenseman Will Borgen, Donato’s former teammate in the USHL and at World Juniors, and Boston University forward Jordan Greenway, whose Terriers squad ousted the Crimson this past Monday in the Beanpot semifinals.
Between the Beanpot heartbreaker and the unrelenting conference schedule, Donato’s Harvard teammates could not give him a formal send-off before he boarded the plane to South Korea Wednesday morning. Plus, Ryan’s departure is surely bittersweet for a Crimson group that has struggled to beat the goaltender recently.
“I kind of feel like I’m deserting them in a way,” Donato said. “[But] they’re all excited for me and this opportunity…. These guys won’t be too lost without me. We have a great senior leadership and junior leadership.”
Donato’s long-term future with Harvard is just as uncertain. With the Bruins showing all the signs of a Stanley Cup contender this season, Ryan could be calling TD Garden his home ice sooner rather than later.
“It’s a scary thought,” Donato conceded. “[But] I pride myself on just trying to focus on the here and now…. And at the end of the year, I’ll have a decision to make.”
For now, the forward will make the most of the opportunity he has been given—partially by sheer luck, and partially, of course, by sheer skill.
However fortuitous the timing and however rare the NHL’s boycott, “Ryan Hockeynato”—once just the curious son of an NHLer, and probably still a mini-sticks enthusiast—will soon sport the stars and stripes as he embarks on arguably the most honorable journey in all of sports.

It’s Datamatch szn, folks. People are trying to find true love (but really free food) by taking an online survey. The questions are quirky each year, but here are a few we think are missing.
Who are you voting for UC?
Let’s face it—UC elections are characterized by consistently low turnout. If the UC is going to change that, they’ve gotta do something big. They didn't need to create a new voting system; they could just ask us to vote at the end of the Datamatch survey, which more than 75% of Harvard undergrads sign up for. Turnout stats would skyrocket (though Quincy would probably manage to still have no one vote), and matching people with opposite stances on final clubs would definitely make for interesting evenings.
Do you like the Patriots?
First off, suck it. Secondly, let’s let all the Patriots fan stick together and not infect the rest of us. They’ll have Patriot-cest and make kids with that “gAWd-AWful” Boston accent while the rest of us live normal, non-Superbowl-losing lives.
Do you want a sugar daddy?
Datamatch is so popular that its purpose should be expanded. Some of us (myself included) NEED this in our lives. How else are we going to afford Blue Bottle Coffee?
Have you ever had sex in the stacks?
Datamatch could be your chance! Match people who haven’t done the deed yet and give them directions to the bowels of Widener and a blanket—that tile floor is cold.
Are you taking more than four classes?
If so, then you’re a masochist and should probably be paired with other masochists.
Are you taking more than five classes?
If you answer anything but “I’d rather go to Yale,” then I’m gonna need you to please stay away from me.

It feels like it happened ten years ago, but this week the New England Brady bunch fell short to the Philadelphia Eagles. While Brady dons his game face in this photo, it devolved into a pout as the fourth quarter ran out.

Everyone basically forgot he was coming after Mila Kunis and the HPT's co-ed announcement stole the show, but Paul Rudd received his Pudding pot on...Monday? Tuesday? Honestly, we're Clueless.

Harvard got beaned by BU in double overtime to fall 3-2 at TD Garden in the Beanpot semis. The real MVPs were all the hopeful fans who waited past midnight to see how the game would unfold.



"The Square really should have more bougie coffee options," said no one ever. Nevertheless, Blue Bottle is here.



You walk into class and it's a clear day. You walk out an hour later in the most inappropriate footwear to find snow everywhere, and fifty new Instagram stories documenting it.
