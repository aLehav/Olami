After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The theater is really enjoying a kind of early days of a golden age,” says an enthusiastic Jim Petosa, the newly named artistic director of Watertown’s New Repertory Theatre. Petosa believes that the combination of the regional theater community’s strength and the recent tendency for local audiences to demand more challenging and experimental theater, such as the American Repertory Theater’s joint venture with British theater company Punchdrunk on “Sleep No More in 2010,  will ignite the new golden age. And he wants to be a part of it.
“The artistic director is the prime steward of the artistic mission of the institution” says Petosa. He or she is in charge of the general artistic and production value of any play that the company puts on. In that sense, Petosa has the power to change how the NRT presents drama as a medium to the public. An example of this is how Diane Paulus, who was appointed artistic director of the American Repertory Theater at Harvard in 2009, took an institution that specialized primarily in avant guarde theater and refocused it on a more populist, and commercially viable, strategy. In other words, Petosa will be determining both the direction and the aesthetic for each season through the plays he chooses to stage and the people he hires. In the context of New Repertory Theatre this means he “has a commitment to doing plays that have a certain dramatic quality to them as works of literature and also have a certain human component in the stories that they tell,” says Petosa.
Petosa has an extensive background in direction as well as in theater administration. He began working at Olney Theatre just north of Washington D.C.  in 1985 and became the artistic director there in 1994—a role he will continue to play until the end of the 2012 season. At the same time he will continue to hold his role as Director of the School of Theatre at the College of Fine Arts at Boston University, a position he has fulfilled since 2002.
He also has previous ties to the NRT as a guest director of several shows, including the off-Broadway cult hit, “The Last Five Years.” His experience working with the NRT won him the new role. “After three months of negotiation, we arrived at the notion that this was going to be a very positive relationship, and we decided to make it happen,” Petosa says.
“The energy of the theater community has grown exponentially over the 10 years that I’ve been living here,” Petosa says.  ”We’re going to find a community that is growing not only in terms of numbers but also in terms of the range of works that it seeks to provide.” Petosa sees this as a regional phenomenon. “While Boston has always been a very smart city and a very cultural city, I think theater is really growing in profile in this region.” He points to a wealth of regional theater companies that focus on commissioning new works—such as the Boston Playwrights Theater at B.U.­—and to foreign theater companies like Punchdrunk deciding to stage shows in the Boston area.
“There are challenges that come with a 21st century economy, but there are also great opportunities,” Petosa says.  Boston’s diversity, both intellectually and culturally, allows for theater to be both artistically and financially successful. He hopes that an eclectic fan base will allow productions that might not be commercially viable in some cities to become successes in Boston. ”We are looking forward to a new era where we can serve this robust audience and grow it in numbers, in size, and in scope—and create a real artistic home,” Petosa says. His strategy is “to put on terrific plays that tell terrific stories and to cast them with the best actors that we can,” not only to satisfy the NRT’s audience, but also to develop artists and give them a place where they “always consider themselves as growing and evolving.”
The 2012-13 theater season reflects many of Petosa’s hopes. It embodies the sort of complexity Petosa describes with both political and universally human themes ranging from marriage equality in “Marry Me a Little” to the morality and justification of bringing a child into the world in “Lungs.” This is a series of plays that demand something from their audiences. Regardless of the success of Petosa’s first season at the NRT, it is clear that he will have a central role to play in maintaining Boston’s reputation as a home for dynamic new theater.

For the budding fashionistas in all of you, suppressed as they may be by midterms and your obligatory Harvard sweats, Flyby's got you covered with the very latest from New York Fashion Week. From furs to dazzling minis, here are the latest trends to hit the runway for both the Spring and Winter seasons.
1. Britney Spears thought she had a good thing going, and she did...that is, until designers this season decided that the belly button is too indecent, even for indecent wear. Sometimes the old adage "less is more" can only be taken so far.
2. We've had a mild winter, but if the weather takes a turn for the worst, you'll want to be ready with your favorite furs—everything from fuzzy scarves to faux collars.
3. Flower prints make a comeback. From psychedelic floral jacquard dresses to floral chiffon evening wear, you're not likely to forget that April showers bring May flowers.
4. (Color) Blocking. Be bold. Go out there and say, or wear, what you mean. But don't go overboard—it's quality over quantity, so stick to a max of three colors in your blocking pattern.
5. Anorak: This trench coat-like creation is bipolar. One part sporty and one part rainy-day chic, you're sure to keep 'em guessing.
6. You better shape up. With sports couture emerging as one of the bigger themes this season, be ready to sport some edgier hoodies.
7. Let sparks fly: Sparkling mini dresses are staying strong this season. Pair yours with a cropped blazer, tights, and a pair of killer pumps, and you'll prove that this outfit is as versatile as you are.
8. Color me mine. This spring your closet will scream summer with hot reds, pretty pinks, and vibrant orange hues.
9. Keeping it on the down low? Go for trendy sorbet-like shades that are low-key and simple, like green mint and foggy blue.
10. Right back at you. The front will catch their eyes, and the back will keep them staring. Look for plenty of backless dresses this season.

Children’s toys: offensive or not? In a moderated discussion on Feb. 8, professor Robin Bernstein posited that racism often exists in unlikely objects and concepts of a culture. Raggedy Ann, a widely recognized stuffed doll of the American childhood experience, is one such unexpected preserve of racism. However, in this recent Writer Series Event held by the Harvard Foundation in conjunction with the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality and the Department of African and African American Studies, Bernstein provocatively challenged the audience to consider the historical context of this seemingly inoffensive childhood object—a subconscious reminder of racism in many childrens’ lives. She engaged in dialogue with organizer and moderator Grace L. Chen ’15 about ideas like this in Bernstein’s new book, “Racial Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Civil Rights to Slavery.” Our modern notion of childhood innocence, Bernstein said, has its roots in an era when entertainment catered exclusively to white children, as evinced by various childhood objects—like Anglo-centric literature and dolls—in the 18th and 19th centuries.
In her introduction, Bernstein described  the 2006 controversy in Louisiana’s Tangipahoa Parish where Justice of the Peace Keith Bardwell refused to marry an interracial couple. Bardwell explained that he does not believe in interracial marriages—not because of race, but because of his desire “to protect the children.”  In his view, representatives from both races in question would not accept interracial children, and thus these marriage would only manage to harm the children in the long term. Bardwell’s statements caused a huge frenzy.  He was forced to resign, and the couple married elsewhere.
Yet Bardwell’s entire argument, Bernstein explained, centered on fictitious children. Bernstein maintained that this argument is but one example of the notion that imaginary children deserved protection more than adults deserve constitutional rights. The contest between imaginary children and living adults inevitably ends in favor of imaginary children; throughout history,  according to Bernstein, legal records have shown a prevailing attitude that it is the nation’s duty to protect these children. Bernstein, however, strongly questioned the legality of this point of view in certain cases.
She asserted that the conflation of childhood with innocence developed within the context of relatively recent racial arguments. The image of an innocent white child was invoked to create feelings of vulnerability and tenderness, but the image of a black child carried a violent script; for example, said Bernstein, the stereotypical “Pickaninny” figure was a dark-skinned child impervious to pain. “Childhood in performance enabled divergent political positions each to appear natural, inevitable, and therefore justified,” Bernstein said. “I call this dynamic ‘racial innocence.’” Racism and segregation could maintain their presence in society through appearing “natural” in children’s toys.
Bernstein highlighted the importance of several physical objects of art present in her book. According to Bernstein, for example, Raggedy Ann’s creator sought to appropriate facial characteristics typical of blackface imagery for the white doll. The collector community, she noted, fittingly categorizes Pickaninny and Mami dolls alongside Raggedy Ann dolls even today. In Toni Morrison’s novel “The Bluest Eyes,” the fictional black child Claudia learns to reject dolls like Raggedy Ann and love more stereotypically Caucasian dolls. According to Bernstein, Raggedy Ann dolls even encouraged violence in children’s play; their softness allowed children to beat, throw, soil, and hang them.
Bernstein drew on the historical doll experiments of 1939, which psychologists Kenneth and Mammie Clark performed to test black children’s self esteem.  Experimenters asked children preferential questions about two identical dolls that were distinguished only by the color of their skin. For years, such tests were thought to reveal a deep internalized racism in black children; in fact, test results were used considerably in the groundbreaking Brown versus Board of Education court decision to explain the illegallity of continuing to perpetuate racial separations. Yet Bernstein wondered if the rejection of black dolls was not a rejection of the self but rather a performance of what these children felt they were “supposed” to do and feel.
These examples struck a chord with the large and engaged audience. “The idea that children are actually agents in the doll test—and they actually do cooperate in some respects with what they are expected to do—is really fascinating to me,” Keon K. Pearson ’15 remarked.
Racial innocence continues to be refigured in post-segregation America. As Bernstein wrote in her book, “The solemnly restored call to ‘protect the children’ reanimates, disguises, and draws power from old, half-forgotten contests over love and pain and fun, over the racial limits of innocence, and over the American question of who is a person and who is a thing.” Through the years, physical objects have informed and changed the public’s perception of racial equality. The movement to desegregate the notion of childhood innocence, Bernstein said, has gradually succeeded but continues its struggles to this day.

Every year the Oscars race seems to become less and less surprising. This year, a  consensus was reached almost a month before this Sunday’s ceremony. Critical opinion seems almost unanimous in predicting the unruffled procession of French silent film “The Artist” to the Best Picture Oscar at the Academy Awards. From a niche arthouse film that made a brief splash at Cannes to the recent loud publicity campaign from its producer, awards supremo Harvey Weinstein, “The Artist” has been the talk of the industry. Anything less than a major share of the main awards in Los Angeles is unlikely for the film, and such an accomplishment will be not be undeserved—it is beautiful entertainment, filled with charming grace notes and a reverence for old Hollywood that the French express well on-screen. Of the films nominated for Best Picture, it is a cut above in quality.
The only other serious contender is Alexander Payne’s “The Descendants,” a typically intelligent look at familial crisis in a Hawaiian setting. At times, however, it seems like an inferior re-run of previous Payne films such as “Sideways” and “About Schmidt,” but without the acid bite that marked out his superlative “Election” of 1999, a picture that skewered the male menopause with political satire and an acerbic wit that seems lacking in “The Descendents.” I would bet on George Clooney to wrest the best actor gong from Jean Dujardin of “The Artist,” however. Clooney has been here before with nominations for “Michael Clayton” and “Up in the Air,” and the Academy may have decided that the time is right to reward him with the top prize, despite Dujardin’s win at the BAFTAs earlier this month. In reality, though, neither performance is as brave or recklessly Promethean as Michael Fassbender’s startling turn as a New York sex addict in the otherwise anemic “Shame.” The Academy rarely seems to reward younger actors these days, though, preferring to honor industry veterans. And so in light of Fassbender’s scandalous omission from the nominations, I’ll take Gary Oldman’s marvelously restrained, reptilian George Smiley in the unfairly overlooked “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” as the performance that deserves the statuette.
Michel Hazanavicius’ win for Best Director for “The Artist” seems pretty much sewn up—as does a further prize for Best Original Screenplay—so the only other potential doubt in the major awards lies in the battle for Best Actress. Meryl Streep recently won at the BAFTAs for her pitch-perfect impersonation of Margaret Thatcher in “The Iron Lady,” but the performance was no more than that—an impersonation that copied the tics and mannerisms precisely but failed to get to the steel and ugliness that lay beneath Thatcher’s prim exterior. Streep, for all her plaudits, did what amounted to an excellent piece of historical karaoke. I would much rather see Michelle Williams win for “My Week with Marilyn.” What her acting and appearance lacked in precision she made up for in coming closer to capturing the essence of an iconic figure than Streep.
A note on the year in film: Once again the Academy Awards have largely failed to recognize the greatest achievements of the last 12 months. “Drive,” Nicolas Winding Refn’s existential pulp thriller, which garnered rave reviews and a gong for its director at Cannes, has picked up a single paltry nod for sound editing. “Tinker Tailor,” the best spy movie in years, has been similarly rejected. “Senna,” the superlative Asif Kapadia documentary about the tragic Formula One racer that has made it onto numerous top-10 lists all year, has been completely snubbed. In the last case, the fault is egregious—“Senna” has rewritten all the conventional rules for biopics and sports films, and its progression is as exciting as watching one of its races in person.
The best film of the year, however, is none of these. Technically “Of Gods and Men” is a 2010 film (debuting at that year’s Cannes festival), but it wasn’t released in America until last March. Its absence exposes not just the scheduling vagaries of the awards system— it fell into an awkward gap between years on account of the awards season really encompassing January and February of any given year—but also the fundamental problem with an awards system in which the best films seem to go consistently neglected. Xavier Beauvois’ film is astonishing—a retelling of the kidnap and murder of a group of Trappist monks by terrorists during the Algerian civil war. This is cinema as religion and act of faith, a hypnotic and transcendent achievement in on-screen storytelling, just the kind of unlikely, brilliant film that the Academy should be rewarding. Its absence speaks louder than any other film’s inclusion, as excellent as they may be.

“There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice,” Elie Wiesel said, “but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.” This has rarely been truer than in Anna Funder’s “All That I Am,” a tale of unrelenting courage among young German revolutionaries in the 1930s. Funder is no stranger to the topic of World War II—she also wrote “Stasiland: True Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall”—and in her first work of fiction, she weaves together the half-invented, half-truthful stories of real-life activists to create a gripping tale of political struggles, breathless escapes, and surprising compassion.
The novel alternates between the viewpoints of Ernst Toller, celebrated poet, playwright, and activist, and Ruth Becker, the cousin of Dora Fabian, the novel’s protagonist. This innovative structure allows Funder to move back and forth in time: As elderly Ernst and Ruth revisit the ghosts of their respective pasts, they flash back to the days of their resistance to the Nazi regime in the 1930s. Both narrators remain displaced from their once-beloved Germany—Ernst lives at the Mayflower Hotel in New York City, where he is dictating a novel on his life to his secretary Clara, while Ruth has found a home in Australia. The creation of a new life in solitude and the painful reminders of a life once lived and friends long lost all take immense tolls on both characters. “In his presence, I am returned to my core self,” says Ruth after receiving Ernst’s autobiography. “All my wry defenses, my hard-won caustic shell, are as nothing. I was once so open to the world it hurts.” Through Ernst’s dictated memoir and Ruth’s recollections, Funder forms a coherent story that is both action-packed and sobering.
At the center of both Ernst and Ruth’s memories lies Dora, a charismatic, fearless, and independent activist. Dora is far from an average woman: She is the essence of righteousness and the sole reason that Ruth and Ernst hold onto hope throughout their trials. Through her work ethic and constant desire to help her friends in need, Funder imagines Dora as the spirit of a true revolutionary who eventually brings all her compatriots—Ernst, Ruth, and others—into her carefully planned and exceptionally action-filled life. “Dora had a sense of purpose so profound that when I was with her it was impossible to feel lost,” Ernst reflects. “It stung a little, but I was grateful to be saved by her. At least half of what we call hope, I believe, is simply the sense that something can be done.” This hope provides the ultimate incentive for these rogue intellectuals throughout the novel, yet Funder constantly reminds the reader of the pain of dreams shattered as the characters face multiple dangers while being hunted down by the ruthless Nazi regime.
These trials are both physical and emotional, and as the Ernst-Ruth faction moves from country to country, their friends and comrades often die or suddenly leave, which creates a constant feeling of terror that seems to seep through the very walls of their hideouts. While resting for a short time in England, the characters struggle both with trying to conform to a culture that is not their own and also facing the challenge of notifying the English government of the imminent threat of war. Their warning is tragically unheeded. Funder, whose characters recall these events that ocurred decades ago, fills the novel with frustration and desperation—and since the reader knows the outcome of Britain’s hesitance to enter the war, these emotions are all the more poignant.
While the friends continue their activist work outside of Germany, Ruth and her journalist husband Hans Wesemann struggle to maintain a trusting relationship. Hans lashes out against the frustrations of his life as a refugee, while Ernst and Dora advance with trepidation through an emerging love affair. The persistent threat of being apprehended by the Nazi government creates tensions that exacerbate the mental states of the four friends. Dora and Ruth must bear the weight of an emotional onslaught: Ernst sinks into a deep depression, and Hans becomes more and more elusive and withdrawn. “I thought that he would get through this, and would come back to me,” bemoans Dora of Hans, “but the price of letting him go was that my own life began to seem second-rate to me, as if I were an understudy in it.” With eloquent musings like this, Funder creates a fabric of emotional frailty apparent in each character; their long, tireless hours of work mask the stress and desperation that follow the losing side of a political struggle as they try to bring down the growing strength of the Nazi regime.
Although the novel is a partially fictitious account of a bleak period of history, Funder manages to avoid losing connections with her characters. “All That I Am” is first and foremost a love story and intertwines the political desires of a group of vehement intellectuals with the emotional rollercoaster of romantic attachment. It is a story that demonstrates the strength of old friendships and the unrelenting pain of hazy memories. By standing resolute in the face of adversity, Funder’s characters manifest a concrete will for survival and truth that speaks to the greater population of individuals who witnessed struggles similar to the ones outlined in the novel. The novel is a beautifully wrought attempt to assuage the pains of history for both the characters and the reader, a fictitious legacy that documents the events of these German refugees in brutal and compassionate clarity.

“Passion is the root of all of our sin, and all our suffering,” Medea cries as she contemplates executing one of the most heinous crimes imaginable­—infanticide. Euripides, perhaps the greatest of all the ancient Greek tragedians, explored what leads a woman to this horrific act, as well as the strength and courage it takes to carry it out, in his classic work “Medea,” which was first performed in Athens in 431 B.C.E. In a new production by the Actor’s Shakespeare Project that runs at the Multicultural Arts Center in Cambridge until March 4, director David R. Gammons strives to honor the play’s timeless themes of betrayal and revenge while updating the costumes, props and set design for modern audiences. While the show boasts a strong cast and innovative set design, Gammons’ ultimately muddies his own message with imprecise directing in some of the plays most crucial scenes.
The play is built around Medea (Jennie Israel) a princess and sorceress from Colchis—an ancient state located in the Caucasus—who in her youth ran off with Jason (Nigel Gore), a dashing Greek adventurer who famously sailed to the far reaches of the Earth to retrieve the golden fleece. After their travels, the couple settles in Corinth and raises a family. However, when Jason decides to leave Medea and marry the daughter of Corinthian King Creon (Joel Colodner), Medea flies into a rage and begins to plot the downfall of the man she once loved.
Though the acting is universally strong, Israel stands head and shoulders above the rest. All her lines are delivered with the visceral emotional intensity they deserve,  yet her real strength lies in what she is able to convey wordlessly. One of the most engaging scenes in the show is when the audience first sees Medea confront the chorus of Corinthian women (McCaela Donovan, Obehi Janice, and Sarah Newhouse). While delivering her first speech, she expresses an immediately relatable sense of hopeless desperation through her facial expression and body language that reveals more about her emotional state that any soliloquy could.
The other highlight of the show was the integration of the set, sound, and lighting. The stage itself was bare, with no props and only the façade of a suburban house as a background which was divided in two by a massive fissure that expands as the show goes on and acts as a metaphor for the damage Jason’s actions do to his family. This sparse display allowed lighting designer Jeff Aldelberg to use his lights to portray Medea’s inner turmoil. During her soliloquies, red lights flood the stage from the house. This sense of desperation was heightened by unearthly noises emanating from the speakers during these scenes. It is almost as if the whole world is bearing Medea’s pain, as the power of her vengeance covers the world in blood and literally splits her house in two.
Despite all of these qualities, the show ultimately suffers from Gammons’ inconsistent directing. The production’s main scenes show some real inspiration, such as the use of modern dance techniques to physically show the dilemmas expressed during the speeches of the chorus. However, lapses in directorial judgment noticably effect how the audience watches the show and understands the characters. In several relatively minor scenes, characters deliver whole monologues with their backs to the audience. Although these directorial mistakes seem for the most part like oversights, some of the play’s most important moments are hamstrung by the directing in a much more jarring fashion. The scene in which Jason finally comes to Medea to try to explain his selfish actions is built around a mixture of fury and lust, which in itself provides an interesting characterization of Medea’s conflicted emotions. However, because of a directorial choice, the pivotal moment of the confrontation comes with Jason on his knees at the back of the stage facing the backdrop. As a result, Gore is robbed of all forms of physical expression that could communicate his inner feelings to the audience. Jason becomes two-dimensional in the one scene that provides him with his best opportunity for creating a well-rounded, sensitive whole. His characterization was sacrificed by Gammons so he could heighten the sexual tension between the two, and the character never recovers. Through no fault to the actor, the audience is left wondering why Medea ran off with Jason in the first place.
“Medea” is for the most part a wonderful play. Its central themes of love, lust, and revenge are artfully explored through stellar acting and an inspired integration of the set and the lighting. However, there is a sense that the overall production is at times held back by the directing, and “Medea,” no matter how close it gets, never quite fulfills its potential.

More than a year after  the nationwide “It Gets Better” campaign was launched in response to a series of homophobic incidents across college campuses and high schools, Harvard’s community has produced its own contribution to the ongoing fight against discrimination and ostracism among young people. The recent “It Gets Better” video created by an anonymous junior resident of Quincy House offers what remains an essential and much-needed message for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and queer communities. More important, however, is the manner in which this message is relayed, for while the video certainly excels in encouraging students to overcome difficult experiences, it also emphasizes a sense of pride and positivity that will undoubtedly incite gay students in less fortunate circumstances to look toward a brighter and happier future.
Plus, let’s be honest, it is refreshing to see so many happy Harvard students at one time. This sight is certainly not encountered as frequently as it should be on our campus, and “It Gets Better” serves as an excellent reminder that smiling Harvard students do in fact exist. At the same time, this work proved successful in ways other than its ability to convey a positive outlook for members of the LGBTQ community. By presenting multiple perspectives from individuals of all backgrounds, “It Gets Better” will likely appeal to a broader range of students, both inside and outside of Harvard’s own queer community. As gay students become increasingly confident about displaying their sexual identity and optimistic about their futures in doing so, their friends, allies, and peers can simultaneously learn about the challenges gay students face. The more dialogue that takes place, the more the entire community can help LGBTQ students overcome these challenges.
Regardless of the fact that Harvard’s receptivity toward the gay community is—considered on a relative and as well as on an absolute basis—highly positive, it remains imperative that students continue to provide messages of support on our campus along the lines of “It Gets Better.” Tellingly, the video’s creator decided to remain anonymous in this work, highlighting the fact that not all students at Harvard feel comfortable revealing their sexuality to the public nor that all Harvard students are by any means sure about their own identities. For this reason, it is important that all members of our community consistently make an effort to address the difficulties faced by gay students, even if these issues are not as prominent on a relatively liberal campus like our own.
Overall, all those involved in the production of “It Gets Better” deserve commendation for presenting an uplifting message for students of all backgrounds and sexual orientations. It is our hope that similar endeavors in the future will adopt the same comprehensive and positive approach to issues related to sexuality.

Liberals would like to have you believe that the current debate over the freedom of religion in America is a battle over basic rights. While framing the debate, Obama and his allies have falsely asserted that this is not a battle for freedom of conscience but for a woman’s right to contraception. Freedom of religion? It’s something that liberals seem willing to accommodate as long as it is convenient—never mind that it is the first freedom in the Bill of Rights. Here’s an inconvenient truth: The right to contraception doesn’t exist, nor should it.
The progressive movement has grown over the past century by feeding off a false and absurd conception of rights. Realizing the extent of the government’s power, progressive leaders from Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, to Lyndon B. Johnson claimed that people had rights not because they were human but because they had subordinated themselves to government. Instead of having a government to protect the rights of the people, they wanted a government to grant rights to the people. As a result, when liberals saw a program that they wanted to implement, they created a right to it. All of sudden, the American people have a right to their entitlements—no matter how bankrupt Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid may be. Democrats wanted the government to take control of the health care market, so they granted the American people a right to health care. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services mandate is just a continuation of the same concept: Democrats have created a right to abortion, sterilization, and contraception (but curiously, only for women). The government mandate is forcing religious institutions to pay for medical “care”—sterilization, abortifacients, and contraception—that they have regarded as evil for thousands of years because policy makers decided that people have a right to these services. Obama’s misnamed “compromise” does nothing to stop this violation of the freedom of religion. The “accommodation” merely requires insurance companies to provide the controversial services and then bill religious institutions for their costs. Either way, religious institutions are required to violate their conscience and pay for services they regard as evil.  It is, as Greg Mankiw has argued, “semantics at the highest level.”
The problem with the progressive model is that it eventually creates a behemoth of unnatural rights unable to sustain itself without consuming the basic freedoms and natural rights of the American people. The Declaration of Independence, the foundation of our understanding of rights as American citizens, states, “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” These inalienable rights are part of our nature as human beings; as such, they cannot be taken away, nor can we voluntarily sacrifice them. The struggle for equality throughout the history of the United States has focused on rights because they are the foundation of equality. Humans are equal not because they have the same abilities or character but because they have the same fundamental, inalienable rights. From the Emancipation Proclamation to Brown vs. Board of Education, some of the finest moments in American history have been the equal extension not of women’s rights or minorities’ rights, but of human rights to all people.
Today, liberals in Washington are attempting to use the power of government to violate these very inalienable rights that they took an oath to defend. “This conscience thing” that Nancy Pelosi has dismissed as an irrational obsession of conservatives is in fact what James Madison called the “the most sacred of all property” and what Jefferson argued was guaranteed by “the principles of the Constitution and the government of the United States.” To violate the natural rights of the American people in order to secure the deluge of absurd progressive “rights” is to reject the foundation of equality and liberty. No one in the Republican Party or the Catholic Church has argued that women should be prohibited from using contraception. What they do object to is the violation of the freedom to practice their religion and participate in civil society because the government decided to create a women’s right to contraception and abortion. No American should be forced not to practice medicine, educate students, contribute to charity, or participate in American civil society because of his religious beliefs. We are all humans with natural rights first and citizens second.
The debate over the HHS mandate is not a debate about the morality of birth control, sterilization, and abortion. It’s a dispute over the extent to which government can violate the natural rights of its citizens. Not long after our own revolution, the French attempted to create a social contract under which the individual ceded all rights and powers to the state in order to be “free.” Things didn’t turn out well, to say the least. Unfortunately, history seems apt to repeat itself, and when liberals stop misrepresenting the debate, perhaps they’ll recognize exactly where we’re headed. The conscience of the nation is at stake.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Occupy Harvard has failed. It achieved some progress in promoting ethical investment, higher wages for Harvard workers, and scaring Goldman Sachs recruiters, but Occupy has utterly failed in a social movement’s most important goal: garnering public support. Far from it, students reacted to Occupy with general annoyance and disdain. Occupy never expanded beyond a small coterie of undergraduates, a larger contingent of graduate students, and some campus workers.
Why? Occupy apologists have sought to explain the movement’s failure by faulting the student body. In Slate, Dylan Matthews argued that Harvard students rejected Occupy because they are part of the 1 percent, saying that students take “great exception to the idea that they might occupy a place of privilege.” Crimson columnist Anita Joseph insisted that it was rather because Harvard students are goody two-shoes who “rarely question authority” and don’t have “rebellion . . . in [their] blood.”
While both explanations have some merit, they fail to account for just how little support Occupy was able to gather. As Matthews has pointed out, the Harvard student body is relatively affluent. Still, there are many students from working- or middle-class backgrounds that Occupy failed to gather under its banner.
Joseph is surely right that, usually, you don’t get to Harvard without playing by the rules. But, as she notes, Harvard is still a very liberal place. A campus poll would undoubtedly find strong support for higher taxes on the wealthy, Dodd-Frank, and health care reform. Harvard students are open to change. They rejected Occupy not because they are closet conservatives, but because the movement incompetently promoted its agenda, much of which liberal students likely support.
The fault for Occupy’s lack of student support lies not with the student body, but with Occupy itself. Occupy suffered from several fatal flaws in its execution that doomed its chances of generating student support.
First, Occupy made a terrible first impression by beginning in chaotic and belligerent fashion. Protesters, several wearing black scarves over their faces, marched through and disrupted Diversitas, a campus celebration of diversity. When security guards, concerned by the large and aggressive crowd—including many who were not Harvard affiliates—closed the Yard gates, Occupy leaders urged protesters to forcibly “take this gate!” and “take the Yard!” Protesters attempted to scale the walls. The Boston Globe reported that “a Harvard official…said a University police officer was ‘roughed up’ at the protest—elbowed and pushed—as protesters pulled at his gun belt and stole his radio.” Occupy apologized for the incidents, but the damage was done.
Incredibly, after the aggressiveness and lack of control of its first night, Occupy declared Harvard’s decision to restrict Yard access to protect the Harvard community a conspiracy to turn students against the movement. Occupy appeared out of touch by failing to recognize that allowing an unlimited number of strangers to encamp in the Yard might pose a health and safety hazard.
The chaos of the first night gave way to the long-term disorganization of Occupy’s agenda. Its Statement of Principles was unsatisfyingly parochial, disconnected from the national Occupy movement. It wasn’t clear how “increasing the diversity” of Harvard’s graduate schools, for instance, was relevant. It was long on self-righteous rhetoric and short on facts and context for its unwieldy hodgepodge of demands. This document made the Occupiers feel good, but it didn’t convince anybody.
Perhaps Occupy’s inability to convert students was due to its own ignorance and consequent lack of credibility. Occupy walked out of an Economics 10 lecture on—wait for it—inequality. Occupy’s open letter to Professor Mankiw blasted him for neglecting John Maynard Keynes. Had they looked at the spring syllabus, they would have discovered that it covers Keynes heavily.
Or maybe Occupiers couldn’t persuade students because they were too sure of themselves to communicate effectively. I asked an Occupy leader to articulate the philosophy behind her belief that it was wrong for a Harvard employee to be making 180 times the salary of another employee. I asked what a better ratio would be and whether different skills merit different compensation at all. In response, she simply expressed her disbelief that I didn’t agree with her.
Maybe Occupy never actually wanted student support. One Occupier referred to “the majority at Harvard” as “the enemy.”
Now, Occupy has devolved into adopting semi-Marxist rhetoric and fringe positions, denouncing “profit motives” and seemingly opposing any and all layoffs, ever. And people are still wondering why students don’t support Occupy?
Occupy likes to imagine that the administration or the student body martyred it. The truth, however, is that Occupy had the chance to spark a rational and important campus discussion of inequality in America, but it shot itself in the foot.

Framed by Freud’s psychoanalytical theories of the subconscious and the onset of film as an artistic medium, Walter Benjamin posited the “optical unconscious,” an unexplored dimension of our visual reality that the mind extracts out of everyday experience. Benjamin believed that photographic technology gained access to this unconscious, revealing facets of the physical world previously out of reach. Just as psychoanalysis lent a deeper understanding of our mental processes by unearthing the instincts we repress, film could display the physical dimensions that escape our everyday perception. In João Almino’s “The Book of Emotions,” originally published in 2008 and now translated into English by Elizabeth Jackson, the “optical unconscious” takes on emotional import. Almino explores this hidden region of experience in telling the tale of Cadu, a blind photographer, who recalls his life through his collections of old photographs that he remembers with perfect precision. Though this unique approach to a fictional memoir is innovative and full of emotional experiences, the descriptions of Cadu’s photographs never reach the grand artistic effect and connection that the reader assumes Almino will deliver.
The novel operates on several temporal planes and details the quotidian struggles of Cadu’s life after he is blinded in an accident. The novel functions as a memoir within a diary: The details of his life in 2022, where he lives alone with his dog in Brasília, unfold alongside sections from his memoir-in-progress, also titled “The Book of Emotions.” He tells his story over six months in the present and 61 photos from the past, as he grapples with both the loneliness of old age and the emptiness of his womanizing past. Though the descriptions of the photographs that conclude each chapter of the memoir are evocative of beauty and life, they do not live up to the excessively high expectations that Cadu’s adoration for his photographic craft builds throughout.
Cadu writes in the present of the photographs he plans to use: “Those photographs reveal themselves in rich detail in my memory.... My blindness reveals their essence, for in the end, to best see a photograph, you have to close your eyes.” This compelling idea near the novel’s opening is a powerful statement of Almino’s thematic intent. As Cadu guides the reader through photographs of his lovers and enemies and the stories of intrigue and corruption behind them, the reader sees his history only through the basis of his fascinating assertions. Yet while the vibrant emotions behind Cadu’s photographs are immediately apparent, their effect, unfortunately, proves difficult to translate to the reader—perhaps because the photographs are never seen in the book’s pages, only described. The reader is thus unfortunately unable to fully appreciate the power of the world Cadu captured behind his lens.
For Cadu, his photographs are his memory, and accordingly they are his way of digesting the past in his waning present. His photographs are thus the easiest way for him to tell his story, and two of his greatly contrasting photography exhibitions exemplify his trials in life and art. The exhibition he is most artistically proud of—his “triangles,” which feature the private parts of a number of women—was a flop, while his most successful exhibition was a series of portraits of Eduardo, the corrupt politician who stole his former lover Joana. The portraits, Cadu’s great plan of revenge,  were intended to expose and caricature Eduardo in front of the entire city. Instead, the public hailed the photographs as a testament to his humorous ability to portray a distinguished person so grotesquely. Just as the reader may find it difficult to connect with the obviously beautiful but emotionally removed photographs of Cadu, so does his audience fail to understand the intended meaning behind his work. Though he himself clearly draws great inspiration and emotion from his photographs—despite not having seen them in years—it is a near-impossible task to translate this same connection to readers without showing the photographs themselves. While probably an unintentional parallel, this mirrored experience is an interesting manifestation of Almino’s underlying unique ideas about the disconnect between art and reality.
Cadu’s greatest frustration thus lies in the fact that other people never interpret his photography in the way he intends. The photographer eventually comes to terms with his own shortcomings and describes his struggles with the elegant description of senescence, “Age doesn’t have its own virtues. It affects each person differently. It just reacts, like a chemical product, to whatever we already carry inside ourselves.” Just like a perfectly defined image appears on photo paper through complicated chemical processes, Cadu reconstructs his memories, despite his blindness, by conjuring up his photographs.
But as he acknowledges, intensity of experience, in a photograph or in old age, varies greatly among subjects and objects depending on their distinct perspective. Cadu’s complex relationship to his art finds expression in the novel as he frequently recalls his nihilistic brother’s favorite phrase, “Reality is reality.” This plain statement seems both out of place and oddly fitting in a novel that tries to represent reality in a new way. Almino looks for art in unexpected places: It is the process of recalling and writing about the photographs that is art, he appears to posit, not only the photographs themselves.
Eventually, Almino’s innovation becomes his demise, for a book whose depth rests on the beauty and power of photographs that the reader cannot see is intrinsically unfulfilling. Certainly, art exists in that unfulfilled desire. Indeed, this desire mirrors Cadu’s melancholic nostalgia as he blindly pieces together his past. But ultimately the novel does not deliver on its implicit promise to explore the most detailed aspects of human behavior: it is not quite the “Book of Emotions” it positions itself to be.

After imprecise Pre-Term Planning data led to another semester of unexpected rises and dips in course enrollment this spring, administrators are considering making changes to the tool.
Pre-Term Planning, which has been in use for three semesters, was developed to provide administrators and professors with a rough headcount of possible enrollees.
This semester’s Pre-Term Planning data led to a historic low in the number of additional teaching fellows that had to be hired after shopping week for Gen-Ed and Core classes, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
However, administrators are searching for ways to make the tool more predictive of actual enrollment across the board, Harris said.“We are well aware that the tool is horrible,” Harris said. “It’s not completely accurate. But for the most part, it’s working.”
For example, the Office of Undergraduate Education is considering pushing back the deadline for students to submit their Pre-Term Planning choices.
However, a later submission date for Pre-Term Planning might make it more difficult to implement classroom changes and to hire additional TFs, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Stephanie H. Kenen said.Harris’ office is also looking “to adopt the ease” of the popular course shopping tool created by students in Computer Science 50.
Harris said that the tool needs to be compatible with other systems within the university, while also ensuring that student data is stored securely. Administrators differed in their interpretations of the objective of the Pre-Term Planning tool.
According to Harris, the purpose of Pre-Term Planning “is not to manage the chaos of shopping week,” but to reduce the number of TFs hired after courses begin.
Kenen said she believes that reducing chaos is one of the objectives of the tool.
“The primary goal of Pre-Term Planning is to reduce the chaos of the first two weeks of classes and improve the educational experience for both students and instructors,” Kenen said.
Professors similarly had mixed impressions of the usefulness of Pre-Term Planning.
Head TF for Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics,” Kevin A. Rader, said that he finds estimates based on historical enrollment numbers more accurate than Pre-Term Planning numbers.
“We more or less ignore the Pre-Term Planning numbers when hiring TF’s,” Rader wrote in an email.
When Pre-Term Planning data indicated that 154 students—only six fewer than total enrollment last spring—showed interest in taking Statistics 107: “Introduction to Business and Financial Statistics,” Rader and Statistics senior lecturer Michael I. Parzen thought the number would be accurate. But 382 undergraduates enrolled in the class this spring—a 146 percent rise from last year.
“Ideally it’s useful for the COOP, but as far as I can tell, we don’t use it for anything useful,” Parzen wrote in an email. “I think we recognize that it’s a new system and not fully implemented yet. The numbers tell that story.”
In an effort to make Pre-Term Planning easier to use, Kenen said that she hopes students will be able to submit their choices this summer through the study card tool currently used for enrollment.
“I think the proposed changes might help,” Astronomy professor Dimitar Sasselov wrote in an email. “I am all in favor of experimenting. That’s the best approach to improving it.”

Immediately upon entering the Institute of Contemporary Art’s new exhibit, “Figuring Color: Kathy Butterly, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Roy McMakin, Sue Williams,” a visitor encounters a strange assortment of artworks: biomorphic ceramic sculptures, violent depictions of exploding bodies, a gigantic bead curtain, and chairs.
The selection seems eclectic, to say the least, but there is something that unifies the four artists in the exhibition—they all use color in a way that evokes the human body. This, in a nutshell, is the premise of the exhibition, which runs until May 20. The four artists are a diverse bunch—Williams is a painter, Butterly is a sculptor, the late Gonzalez-Torres worked with installations, and McMakin is a sort of postmodern carpenter—and their use of color is not quite enough to unite their unique styles into a cohesive show. Indeed, though the individual works are distinctive and thought-provoking, the connections between them seem contrived rather than coincidental, and these forced categorizations distract from the pieces’ other themes.
Given the diversity of works, curator Jenelle Porter wisely divided the rooms based on subject matter to give the pieces in each room greater cohesion  The show is grouped into four rooms: “Surface,” “Insides,” “Memory,” and “Joy.” Only the “memory” room successfully unites dissimilar works around a common use of color; the other three rooms’ intriguing individual pieces are thematically disjointed.
Though the “Memory” room only features two artworks—McMakin’s 2003 “Lequita Faye Melvin” and Feliz Gonzalez-Torres’s 1991 “Untitled (Lover Boys)”—it manages, more than any other room, to emphasize how the artists use color to evoke similar themes. Gonzalez-Torres’s piece, made up of 355 pounds of blue and white candy, is a tribute to his partner, who died of AIDS. McMakin’s piece, though less funereal, is explicitly concerned with remembrance. The work, a monochrome reproduction of all of the furniture he recalls from his childhood homes, is a strikingly literal representation of the weight of memory. Both works use a severely limited palette to create a somber mood, though there are nuances—while Gonzalez-Torres memorializes a specific loss, McMakin uses his muted grays to make a melancholy statement about the passage of time itself. The uniformly gray household items, oddly clustered in the middle of the vast gallery, feel both surreal and poignant.
This room is the high-water mark of the show. Nowhere else is there such graceful interplay between the works. The “Joy” room, though supposedly thematically unified, is problematic: The pieces share exuberant, bright colors, but the messages of the works are divergent. Though Williams’ vibrant canvases don’t clash visually with the blue mirror that is Gonzalez-Torres’s 1991 “Untitled (Fear),” they also don’t engage with the darker undercurrents in the latter work. The room ignores the deeper themes of these works in its effort to classify them by color.
More troubling are the rooms that do not group works by emotions. In the “Insides” room, for instance, Williams’ paintings are paired uncomfortably with another installation by Gonzalez-Torres—a gigantic bead curtain called “Untitled (Blood).” Though Gonzalez-Torres’ work superficially connects with Williams’ paintings, which depict explosions filled with body parts, Williams’ pieces take a more inflammatory tone. Gonzalez-Torres’s work is a somber piece about those killed by AIDS. Williams’ works, with names like “American Enterprise” and “Record Profits,” advance explicitly polemical messages, given punch by her use of uniformly applied colors against a white background, which recalls the clear contours of Roy Lichtenstein. Because they do not work together on a thematic level, the works must compete for the audience’s attention. Though Williams’s paintings are large, they seem much smaller compared to the truly massive “Untitled (Blood),” which diminishes their visceral impact.
A similar imbalance occurs in the “Surface” room, which is devoted to works by McMakin and ceramic artist Butterly. McMakin’s furniture here is more subtle than his “Lequita Faye Melvin” and is thus overshadowed by Butterly’s bizarre ceramic pieces. Though tiny, these works are notable for their sexual frankness; one piece, entitled “Just for Men,” resembles a vagina complete with pubic hair. A slide on the wall identifies both works as being concerned with sensuality; while this is evident in Butterly’s work, it is much more subdued in McMakin’s two items. McMakin’s subtlety is not a failing, nor are Butterly’s sculptures are too forthright, but by juxtaposing them, the exhibit leads viewers to overlook McMakin’s quieter statements.
This combination—like so many of the matchups in “Figuring Color”—is misjudged and plays to neither of the works’ strengths. Gonzalez-Torres, Butterly, McMakin, and Williams all use color in intriguing ways, but four such diverse artists do not a movement make, and while this exhibit’s concept is interesting, its forced execution seems detrimental to the artists’ powerful works.

The sinister smiley faces that decorated the intimate stage, with dripping black circles for eyes and mouths, heralded an impending perversity as a rowdy crowd awaited Die Antwoord at the Paradise Rock Club. The South African trio has garnered international acclaim since the music video for the hit single “Enter the Ninja” became an online sensation. The group’s widespread exposure has partly resulted from its blatant shock value—its lyrics are so singularly focused on violence and moral corruption that its sophomore effort, “Ten$Ion,” was deemed too outrageous to be released on Interscope Records. But while the group’s brazenness has offended some, it has won them many ardent followers; after Die Antwoord’s particularly raucous and hysterical set Friday night, many concertgoers left relishing the group’s rebellious spirit and refusal to conform with the music industry and stale social convention.
The concert began on an unexpectedly fragile note. As the lights dimmed, the ominous faces were joined by a projection of South African painter and DJ Leon Botha, which illuminated the empty stage as the ominous transition music faded to a tense quiet. Botha, who died last June, was one of the world’s oldest survivors of a rare genetic disease called progeria, which causes early symptoms of aging. Botha in his last years was an icon of South African creativity and perseverance as well as a close friend of the members of Die Antwoord, and it seemed odd to start a sold out hip-hop show with such a mournful tribute. But as the concert progressed, this opener helped to symbolize Die Antwoord’s bizarre modus operandi: exposing sensitivity through anger and empathy through aggression. The trio represents Zef, a lower-class South African counterculture movement, and the rappers seek to embody the anger felt by counterparts all over the world.
The somberness quickly gave way to Die Antwoord’s typical outlandishness. DJ Hi-Tek, Die Antwoord’s beat-master extraordinaire, arrived onstage first in a bright orange sweat suit and a grotesquely deformed dog mask. Shortly thereafter, rappers Ninja and Yo-Landi Vi$$er joined him in the same garish outfits; Yo-Landi Vi$$er sported black contacts accentuated with white eyeliner and a space-age mullet haircut. Their style can be best described by a quote from their website: “fre$h, futuristik, flame-throw-flow-freeking.” After the fresh and fiery opener “Wat Kyk Jy?” Ninja addressed the audience with his eyes bulging: “Yo Boston, what’s pumpin’ in this bitch!?” The fervent crowd, intoxicated with excitement and who knows what else, responded by shrieking and moshing.
For the next 75 high-energy minutes, Die Antwoord, which translates to “the answer” in Afrikaans, was “pumpin’” harder than anyone else in Boston. Ninja launched himself into the throng several times, thrashing among his adoring fans. One vivacious female fan spent several songs, including “U Make a Ninja Wanna Fuck,” on stage, grinding maniacally with Ninja as he stripped down to his boxers and violently thrust his hips. Another crowd member, wearing only a bright gold thong, joined Ninja and Yo-Landi Vi$$er on stage for the infectious techno-inspired track, “I Fink U Freeky.” Those new to Die Antwoord were shocked by its profane performance art, while  the older fans were shockingly accustomed to the shtick. As one Harvard concertgoer—who prefered to go unidentified—remarked as he grooved to the intensely frantic beat of “Baby’s On Fire,” “They may be the creepiest human beings I’ve ever seen.” Through profoundly disturbing and perplexing craft, Die Antwoord got the crowd moving on a visceral level.
The trio’s encore was final evidence of the group’s innovation and art. Its biggest hit, “Enter the Ninja,” transformed into a defiant manifesto as Ninja rapped “We not like the rest / My style is UFO / Totally unknown.” At the beginning of the dubstep-infused final act, “Never Le Nkemise 2,” Ninja again addressed the crowd: “Boston 2012! We in da future now … Fok da system; we have our own system! We make our own rules. We don’t answer to no one.” And as they left the stage, the projection of Leon Botha appeared once again. There is something undeniably “futuristik” about their particular strain of enraged sensitivity—it is a testament to their forward-thinking sensibility that they have collaborated with high-culture innovators like filmmaker Harmony Korine and fashion designer Alexander Wang. Given their vulgarity and the specificity of their social concerns, Die Antwoord would seem likely to remain in semi-obscurity. But the brute force of their convictions is understood on an instinctive level. Their music provides a refreshing and distinctively new “antwoord” to social tensions that can never fully be resolved.

“I’m gonna put my pink dress on and do my hair up tight,” Sinéad O’Connor sings in an uncharacteristically upbeat voice. “I’m gonna put some eyeliner on; I’m gonna look real nice.” Thus begins “How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?” the ninth release from pop-rock’s queen of controversy and an album as wholly disorganized, delightful, and powerful as the artist herself. It is a welcome return to form for O’Connor as she revisits the juxtaposition of melancholia and playfulness that made her earliest albums so successful. Though “How About I Be Me” occasionally struggles with inherent thematic inconsistency, the album—which centers around the risks and rewards of love—is an intensely moving and often beautiful collection.
Given O’Connor’s solemn past, it would make sense if the light, romantic themes that appear in “How About I Be Me” were simply exercises in cynicism. Yet it appears that her personality and outlook have in fact changed over the years, for she performs her upbeat songs with an earnest sincerity. “One day he’ll say that’s my girl / The happiest words in the world / Make me laugh like an idiot,” she sings with emergent enthusiasm in “Old Lady.” In “The Wolf is Getting Married,” O’Connor describes her own emotional domestication.
However, O’Connor’s famous forte is to dwell on the painful aspects of her past and humanity, and her newfound optimism is thematically overwhelmed by her long-standing trepidations about love and life. While her carefree songs offer glimpses at her future—or her hopes for her future—O’Connor delves more introspectively into the haunted aspects of her past and the various failures of humanity. By the second track, the despondent and achingly lonesome “Reason With Me,” it is clear that the skeletons in O’Connor’s closet are far from gone. Her famously breathy and emotive voice shines against minimal piano and guitar backing, as she knowingly sings, “If I love someone, I might lose someone.”
This sense of deep internal hurt, an emotion that is clearly missing in the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it relationships of many other artists’ pop songs, returns in “Very Far From Home,” another vocals-focused song with minimal background distractions. “I long for you / See you in my dreams, so clearly,” O’Connor sings pensively. “When I wake up I’m alone and I don’t know where you’ve gone / But I know it’s very far from home.” Her maturity as an artist shines through on meditative tracks like this one.
The vacillations—between her infatuation and insecurity, her carefree nature and her haunted past—form a build-up to the beautiful zenith O’Connor reaches in the penultimate track “I Had A Baby.” Motherhood is a rich source of material for O’Connor—she devoted her fourth album, “Universal Mother,” to a similar theme—and “I Had A Baby” strips away expected layers of analysis to express pure joy, an emotion rarely seen throughout the album. Powerful percussion helps build a crescendo of emotion as she sings, “I had a fling with / A man who wasn’t mine to be with…. But I had a baby / So, I’m never sorry!”
The innocent laugher of a baby breaks up the track and forms a prelude to a powerful repeat of the verse.  It is not the rather commonplace and straightforward lyrics that lend this song its power but the undeniable, compelling emotion that elevates O’Connor’s voice to celestial heights.
Easy symbolism could come from ending the album with the laughter of a baby, but O’Connor has never shied away from an opportunity to voice her controversial opinions. She is deeply religious yet frequently condemned for her inflammatory comments and chooses to complete the album with a pared-down track condemning fame and supporting the power of her own Christian beliefs. This approach has the potential to come across as haughty, but O’Connor spares no one—least of all herself.  “Tell me now, what’s a real V.I.P.?” she questions. “Who are we to give that name to us, when we don’t know the lives of others?” As the last echoes of lightly humming strings and her silken voice fade into the background, she whispers a seemingly serious line of the “Gloria Patri,” yet then emits a distinct stream of laughter.
That is Sinéad O’Connor: an indefinable conundrum, ever wavering between mirth, melancholy, and contention. The vast contrasts, thematically and musically, between the songs on “How About I Be Me” highlight her fluid versatility as an artist. She may want the world to let her be herself, as the album’s title would suggest, but it’s unlikely the world will ever know who that truly is.

In the Miss Boston Pageant Sunday evening, Kelsey A. Beck ’14 took home first place, earning the title of “Miss Boston 2012.”
Beck, a newcomer to the pageant world, will compete in the Miss Massachusetts Pageant on June 29 and 30 in Worcester. If she wins in the June pageant, Beck will go on to compete for the title of “Miss America.”
“It’s very surreal,” Beck said. “It’s such a dream and such an honor. I’m humbled by the very thought of it.”
By winning the title of Miss Boston, Beck is following in the footsteps of Loren Galler Rabinowitz ’10, who won the Miss Boston pageant in 2010. Rabinowitz then went on to win the Miss Massachusetts Pageant and to compete in the televised Miss America Pageant.
On Sunday, Beck competed against 10 other young women. During the contest, she showed off her talent on the piano, walked in both the bathing suit and evening gown portions of the event, and answered an onstage question.
In addition to the $1,500 academic scholarship included in the first place prize, Beck has been provided with a team that will prepare her for everything from being interviewed to walking gracefully for the Miss Massachusetts Pageant in June.
According to Beck, the pageant ran “perfectly” for her. She said that the question portion of the program, during which she spoke in front of an audience of about 300, was the only time that she became nervous.
“My heart was beating really fast, but one of my high school coaches told me...‘If you’re nervous, it’s good because it means you care,’” Beck said.
According to Natalie B. Doyle ’14, Beck had 35 supporters to cheer her on at the pageant, including friends, fellow members of the Harvard sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma, and family from her home state, Florida.
“This speaks to how loved she is,” Doyle said. “Knowing how bright, talented, and genuinely kind Kelsey is, we knew going in that she would be a tough contestant to beat.”
Beck’s mother, Barbara Ivey Beck—the winner of the Miss Florida Pageant in 1971—echoed Doyle’s vote of confidence.
“She’s a strong, independent, passionate young woman,” Barbara Beck said.
However, she added that she and Beck’s father would have supported her whether she won or lost.
“[Kelsey] was always going to be our little winning girl,” Barbara Beck said.
Beck said that she hopes to use her new title to advance her platform for elderly care.
“It will just broaden my circle of influence and give me a better chance to spread my platform and be a role model to young women,” said Beck.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is good to see a movie that portrays the CIA’s best agents putting their talent and technology to good work—stalking a blonde bombshell and injuring children in a game of paintball. To be fair, in “This Means War,” FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) do a lot more. They also adopt and mistreat a dog, charter fancy sports cars, and acquire private access to trapeze sets—all for the purpose of impressing the aforementioned hot girl, Lauren Scott (Reese Witherspoon). Despite this flashy exterior, however, “This Means War” is a particularly generic, uninspiring romantic comedy with a disappointingly underdeveloped CIA subplot that fails to impress.
The two male lead characters are strangely amorphous. Firstly, no explanation is ever given as to why Pine’s character is named “FDR.” Furthermore, they seem more like sexually frustrated, spoiled teenagers than suave secret agents. After being explicitly told in the first scene of the movie that their mission is, in fact, covert, their subterfuge tactics seem to consist of flirting with anything that moves, feigning intoxication, punching bad guys, and haphazardly shooting things.
FDR has the classic good looks and philandering tendencies of a debonair, charismatic James Bond. His tactics, though, are thoroughly infantile—he introduces himself to a woman early on as a cruise ship captain who is in possession of a “large vessel” which she is welcome to go aboard while a nagging Tuck reminds him they have an arms-dealing pair of German brothers to go nab. Lauren, the woman with whom both Tuck and FDR become infatuated, is frustratingly shallow. She dresses like a Barbie, adores sports cars and dogs, sings to herself in public, and is terribly indecisive, but that is as deep as it goes.
Like so many romantic comedies, “This Means War” is overflowing with clichés and stock characters. The least forgivable is Lauren’s vulgar, moronic, and overpowering best friend Trish (Chelsea Handler). She encourages Scott to date two men at once on the basis of an obligation to all the women who have no choice but to sleep with the same man every night. As if Trish were not repulsive enough, the audience is forced to watch her roll around on the floor with her slimy boyfriend as they eat Cheetos out of each other’s mouths while she talks to Lauren on the phone. Then, of course, the stereotypically sassy black female boss (Angela Bassett), and the villains, who, true to form, consist of a German ringleader (Til Schweiger) with Russian minions doing business with the Chinese.
Mixing action spy thriller with romantic comedy could have given “This Means War” the means to escape from the annoyingly formulaic and trite. Quickly, though, any actual exciting CIA operations are entirely forgotten about, and the unimpressive spy gadgetry—which mostly consists of surveillance equipment, tranquilizer darts, and a great deal of expendable cash—becomes nothing more than toys for the men to use as they please as they compete for Lauren. A fully fleshed-out subplot, rather than just the occasional fight scene with the apparent bad guys, could have provided a welcome dose of excitement as well as a respite from the banality of the romantic plotline. Even short of that, where are the ejector seats, the jet packs, the dagger shoes, the X-ray glasses and explosive chewing gum? Such silly spy movie staples could at least have made Tuck and FDR’s CIA privileges a bit more worthwhile.
There were a few funny moments and one worthwhile acting performance on the part of Hardy as Tuck. The premise that each agent was able to watch and record every moment of Lauren’s life as well her interactions with his rival added a new dimension to the romantic comedy formula. And Hardy played a much more sympathetic and likable character that provided reprieve from the obnoxiousness of every other aspect of the movie. However, these brief moments could not redeem the film.
The movie takes its tagline right out of the MAD magazine comic strip “Spy vs. Spy,” but it lacks the ingenuity or political irreverence of the strip, which has been running for over 50 years. While the black and white spies in the comic strip rig dynamite to turtles and surreptitiously electrocute each other through a constantly changing variety of means, Tuck and FDR just spy on each other and compete in a run-of-the-mill pissing contest. Though “This Means War” tries to create an amusing and exciting genre fusion, not without a few successfully funny moments, the characters and potentially engaging spy plot are underdeveloped. The result is mostly bland and occasionally generic to the point of repugnancy.

Groundbreaking funk musician George Clinton envisioned his band, Parliament-Funkadelic, as a group of groovy interstellar aliens that traveled via the “P-Funk Mothership.” His Mothership landed in Boston last Thursday to unite Clinton with the Berklee College of Music’s P-Funk Ensemble, an orchestra devoted to playing the works of Parliament-Funkadelic. The culmination of a four-day residency Clinton spent at Berklee, the event began with the presentation of an honorary doctorate of music to Clinton and ended in a wildly funky concert. The show  succeeded through not only its expert musicianship and production design but also its faithfulness to the sound and energy of Clinton’s genre-defining work.
Before the show, Berklee President Roger H. Brown donned star-studded glitter sunglasses and a gold medallion chain to award Clinton the honorary degree. There are few living artists who so innovatively capture popular music, Brown proclaimed, and the crowd roared in agreement.
Then the curtain rose to reveal the full Berklee ensemble, which quickly demonstrated how fluidly it could traverse the decades of Clinton’s soulful repertoire. After the old-school R&B number “Lonely Island,” which highlighted the crisp falsetto of vocalist Khalil Overton, music director Lenny Stallworth announced that the audience would be taking a journey through time. The group transitioned from 1960 to the 1967-released “Testify,” and Clinton himself reappeared on stage as if summoned by the band’s quickening rhythm. “Testify” climaxed with soprano wails and a dramatic horn finale, The band slid just as smoothly into the ’70s with “Children of Production,” the vocalists eerily chanting, “We love you, Dr. Funkenstein,” over a synthesizer, bass, and horn groove.
The show’s gaudy, psychedelic aesthetic mimicked the theatrics for which Parliament-Funkadelic is known. Bathed in purple light, the beaming ensemble appeared in lime green fur robes, cheetah boots, fringed bell bottoms, tribal face paint, pink tiaras, winged eye makeup, blue fingernails, striped tights, and tie-dyed tops. Clinton strolled onstage in a shiny silver suit and white fedora. What made these stylings so effective was not sheer eccentricity; rather, the spectacle of Clinton and the ensemble’s extravagant stage presence matched the zealous fervor with which they played.
Throughout the show, masterful solos and passionate vocals showcased the group’s skill in handling Clinton’s complex grooves. Guitarists Stefan Kallandar and Lewis Robertson broke out long, intricate solos—one amidst the hyper-kinetic jam of “Alice in My Fantasies” that brought the audience to stomping and dancing, and one played behind the guitarist’s head in the climactic “One Nation Under a Groove.” The vocalists’ versatility shone as they reproduced Parliament-Funkadelic’s wide array of moods and sounds. They shifted between twanging and operatic melodies in “Flashlight,” low, bouncy lines on “Mothership Connection,” and even a surreal interlude in “Aqua Boogie” in which they engaged in playful banter in nasally tones. In “Mothership Connection,” they also showed an ability to sustain one of the most recognizable and challenging vocal lines in P-Funk’s work—the high, swelling chant of “Swing down, sweet chariot. Stop and let me ride.”
As the concert continued, never once did Clinton or the P-Funk Ensemble lose its energy and connection with the audience. By “Children of Production,” the hip-swinging ensemble had the crowd imitating its movements—when they swayed, the audience swayed; when they jumped, the audience jumped. The instrumentals softened to emphasize the percussion in “P-Funk (Wants To Get Funked Up),” and Clinton held the microphone to the audience as it chanted, “Make my funk the P-Funk / I wants to get funked up.” Clinton engaged the audience with call-and-response lyrics in other songs, such as “Mothership Connection” and the sassy “Up for the Down Stroke,” and when the musicians held up signs bearing mantras like “Free Your Mind,” the crowd erupted in cheers.
With every song, the audience moved toward the musicians as if in a trance, though they were soon repelled by Berklee security guards. “Do not attempt to adjust your radio,” one vocalist declared. “We have taken control to bring you this special show.  We will return it to you as soon as you are grooving.”
The concert climaxed with a P-Funk classic, “Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker),” which flowed so smoothly into “One Nation Under a Groove” that the pieces seemed like one single, furious song. The song’s message of unity through funk felt fitting—the entire concert thrillingly captured the organic interplay of music, theatrics, and audience connection that defines Clinton’s work.
The band dragged Clinton out for an encore, “Standing on the Verge of Getting It On.” As Clinton pranced back and forth onstage, one ensemble member held a sign, written on notebook paper, that quoted “Give Up the Funk”: “OMG U Totally turned us mothaz out!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even before Brandyn Curry brought down the house with the first dunk of his college career with 8:48 to play at Lavietes Pavilion Saturday night, the junior point guard had been putting on a show for the Harvard men’s basketball team. Curry had a career night, leading the Crimson with 18 points—14 of which came during the second half—as Harvard took down Ivy rival Yale, 66-51. Curry also paced the Crimson with a game-high five assists on the night.
“[Curry has] been our playmaker,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He made plays tonight, but it was for himself…. He can score and it was nice to see him find a rhythm, be offensively aggressive, and make plays.”
Curry entered the weekend fifth in the conference in both assists and steals per game, averaging 5.0 and 1.5, respectively. The junior also owns a league-leading 2.7 assist-to-turnover ratio.
Curry’s performance bolstered a balanced offensive effort for the Crimson, helping Harvard bounce back from its first Ancient Eight loss on Feb. 11 at the hands of Princeton.
“This was a huge weekend for us,” Curry said. “I’m glad we were able to take care of business…and were able to buckle down and get the two Ws.”
RUN-AROUND
Although the Crimson got off to a strong start, outscoring the Bulldogs from the get-go, Yale looked poised for a comeback after going on an 11-0 run in the final four minutes of the first half, slicing a 20-point Harvard lead to nine before halftime.
But Harvard’s consistent shooting proved too much for the Bulldogs. The Crimson shot an impressive 54.3 percent from the field on the night and went 5 of 10 from deep.
“The beauty of our team this year is that we have such good balance,” Amaker said. “We don’t have a go-to guy. We like to say our go-to guy is the open guy, and we like that brand of basketball.”
In the first half, Harvard fared even better, hitting 15 of its 26 shot attempts, while Yale knocked down only 33.3 percent from the field. The Bulldogs’ shooting improved in the second half, good for 37.2 percent on the game, but Harvard’s consistency kept the game out of reach.
SCORING STRUGGLES
Although Yale boasts one of the best post players in the league in center Greg Mangano—who is averaging just under a double-double this season with 18.4 points and 9.9 rebounds per game—the Bulldogs struggled to score inside. In the first half, Harvard posted 20 points in the paint, while Yale was only able to knock down one shot in the key.
“We’re a deep team,” co-captain Keith Wright said. “Coach says to us sometimes, ‘It’s amazing what we can accomplish when no one cares who gets the credit.’ We’re a scary team like that. On any given night, someone can come out and score close to 20 points.”
The spread in the second half was much more even, with Harvard earning the slight 12-8 edge from close range.
Mangano impressed with 22 points and 11 rebounds on the night, but only three other Yale players—Jeremiah Kreisberg, Austin Morgan, and Reggie Willhite—scored more than four.
“Mangano’s a tough force down low,” Curry said. “We just had to wear them down, so I was attacking all night.”
Harvard’s defense held the Ivy League’s most productive offense to just 51 points, far below Yale’s average of 70.2 points per game. Although the mark is Yale’s second lowest offensive output of the season, the Bulldogs fared better against the Crimson at Lavietes than in the two teams’ last meeting in which the Bulldogs mustered just 35 points.
“Going into the game, our focus is to make everything tough for Morgan,” Curry said. “We feel that when he has a good night, they’re very successful as a team.”
“[We tried to] force [Mangano] to take some tough shots,” Wright added. “We know their offense runs through him. He hit a couple threes and some tough twos down there. We focused on him, just trying to maintain him…and limit him and other guys like Willhite and Morgan. Those are their x-factors.”

Harvard revealed its offensive gameplan early in Friday night’s matchup against Brown, as co-captain Keith Wright registered six of the team’s first 11 points. By the end of the first half, the forward had already recorded a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.
“We were very pleased with how much he was attacking the backboard,” Amaker said. “I thought he had a great first half.”
While Wright only played eight minutes in the second half, the Crimson continued to exploit its size advantage. Freshman Steve Moundou-Missi took over in the second frame, tallying nine points and four rebounds, an impressive performance for a young player who averages only five points per game. Moundou-Missi finished the game with 14 points, the second highest total in his career.
In total, Harvard scored 34 of its 69 points down low while limiting Brown to only 14 points in the paint. The Crimson big men also out-rebounded the Bears, 40-23, on the night and 22-9 in the first half. Harvard recorded 10 rebounds on the offensive end, leading to 10 second-chance points.
BORN TO RUN
Seven minutes into the game, Harvard found itself up by a single point against the Ivy League cellar-dwelling Bears. Eleven minutes later, the Crimson was up 21 and well on its way to another Ivy victory thanks to a 20-0 run that put the game out of reach in the first half.
The run was sparked by a dunk by freshman Jonah Travis, a Kyle Casey three-point play and two more Casey free throws. Those first seven points all came from post production, a strength for the Crimson all night. In total, Harvard’s frontcourt totaled 15 of its 20 points during the run, eight of them coming from Wright and Moundou-Missi. The big men and others also got to the line nine times over the 11 minutes, where they missed three attempts.
The streak was also a product of the Crimson’s stingy defense. Brown went scoreless for nearly 11 minutes as Harvard limited the Bears’ looks at the basket. The Crimson defence forced two turnovers and blocked four shots during the stretch.
BENCH POINTS
In the second half of the blowout, no starter played more than 10 minutes. While they rested for Saturday night’s matchup with Yale, a number of rookies and role players got their time to shine.
“We played our bench a lot, and I thought those were really good minutes for those kids,” Amaker said. “We gave those kids extended minutes to get them more confident in an Ivy League battle. I thought they performed very, very well.”
Moundou-Missi led the bunch with 14 points, nine rebounds, and four blocks, but others stepped up as well. In 14 minutes of action, freshman Wes Saunders tallied nine points while showing his potential to score off the dribble. Fellow freshman Jonah Travis recorded five points in 15 minutes, and brought down four rebounds, including two on the offensive end. Freshman sharpshooter Corbin Miller went three of four from deep, scores that accounted for all nine of his points.
“He’s playing really good minutes for us,” said Amaker of Miller. “He’s given us good production off the bench, and we have a great deal of confidence in Corbin. He’s been our best shooter during this stretch.”

“Music on the executant side is a noisy art, and the University sorely needs a well-equipped special building where singers, scrapers and pluckers of strings, blowers on reed or brass, and pounders of drums may enjoy themselves, undisturbed and undisturbing.” So wrote Walter R. Spalding, Class of 1887, a music professor at Harvard in the early 20th century. That devotion to student musical performance continues in the Music Department—renovations were recently completed on Paine Music Hall, the department’s main concert space, to enable an increased emphasis on practice and performance.
The hall’s official reopening will be celebrated Friday with a concert by the Portland String Quartet. The quartet will play pieces by John Knowles Paine, a composer and music professor at Harvard in the 19th and 20th centuries and Paine Hall’s namesake. The hall has been in use since the start of the semester, as have the classrooms and offices that were renovated concurrently. The refurbished practice facilities, located in the basement of the building, have been open since the start of the fall term.
Ideally, the new hall will house rehearsals, performances by student and professional musical groups, music talks, and master classes. “As it should be, the concert hall is ultimately the heart of the Music Department, as a lab is the heart of a science department,” says Federico Cortese, the director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra.
When renovations began last May, the hall, built in 1914, was in need of an upgrade. It lacked air conditioning and so could barely be used during the summer; more critically, soundproofing was minimal. “My office is directly below the concert hall, and before the renovations, if there was a performance in the concert hall, I could hear it clearly in my office; if I was playing the piano or having singers in my office, it could be heard in the concert hall,” says Director of Choral Activities Andrew G. Clark. The problem of sound pollution meant that while the hall was in use, students were not allowed to use the practice rooms, which had low ceilings and were not air-conditioned.
The renovations consisted installing additional soundproofing, outfitting the practice rooms with a state-of-the-art recording system, adding a noiseless air conditioning system to the whole building, and enhancing the lighting. “You can’t see the physical differences in the hall itself so much, but it’s quiet and comfortable,” says Nancy B. Shafman, the Music Department’s Director of Administration, on a tour of the building with Interim Music Department Chair Anne C. Shreffler. “You can feel the difference,” Shreffler adds.
The practice rooms have been expanded, and two of the rooms include “virtual acoustic environments,” which allow students to experience the acoustics of a variety of performance spaces and to record their playing. Though there are two fewer rooms now, the new soundproofing makes up the difference by allowing for simultaneous use of the hall and the practice rooms, thus increasing the number of hours the rooms remain available in total.
Some student music groups have eagerly awaited the hall’s reopening because the space uniquely fit their sizes and performance styles. Jesse C. Wong ’12, music director of the Bach Society Orchestra, says Paine Hall accommodates the group perfectly because it is not as big as Sanders Theatre and provides a more intimate setting. “The orientation [of Paine Hall] is really nice—you can feel that there are a lot of people in the audience when we fill up the house,” Wong says. “I’m excited to see how the hall will sound when we have our [next] performance.” During the renovations, the group had to play in locations like Lowell Lecture Hall and Sanders Theatre. “Sanders is a great space but really too big for an orchestra of our size, and Lowell Lecture Hall was an interesting concert because it is also a very intimate space but is not really made for an orchestra,” Wong says.
For Clark, the difficulty of securing space for his choirs was exacerbated by what he views as a lack of available facilities. “There’s not exactly an overflow of free space on campus for arts and for performance,” Clark says. “It made a pretty tight and challenging situation even more challenging, but everyone from my perspective seemed to have a good attitude about it and knew that it was the best thing in the long run.”
In the Music Department, some feel the renovated facilities may improve the caliber of instruction and the competitiveness of the program. “It may impact our ability to recruit students with strong artistic performance backgrounds when they see that the music building is not just a historical relic but rather a place that communicates something more dynamic, something more fresh,” Clark says.
The renovations are also seen as part of a trend in the Music Department toward placing a greater value on practice and performance. The Music Department has no performance branch, and students cannot earn degrees in vocal or instrumental performance. However, Shreffler says, “The department’s emphasis has shifted to being more welcoming of performance or more convinced that performance is an integral part of our curriculum.” More and more courses, she says, incorporate student performance or bring in guest performers. “With this new-ish emphasis on performance, we need space, and this renovation made us able to use the space we have in a much more efficient way,” she says.
Cortese sees the renovation as a sign that Harvard’s approach to music is changing for the better. “I think this can be an important piece in having music, as in playing, and not just theory or musicology,” he says. “Anything that has to do with attention to practice, attention to performance, attention to music-making, I think, as a musician, is a step forward.”

The notorious legacy of the Los Angeles Police Department makes its way back to the big screen in the intense drama “Rampart,” in which Woody Harrelson poignantly plays corrupt L.A. cop Dave Brown. Titled in reference to the area around Rampart Blvd. that was policed by a corrupt, brutal LAPD anti-gang unit in the late 1990s, the movie portrays a tense era, characterized by unprovoked beatings and shootings. Under director Oren Moverman, “Rampart” showcases the unraveling of Brown, a policeman whose head is barely above the surface of the flood of excesses he has created in his life. Through a believable acting performance by Harrelson coupled with a satisfyingly complex script, “Rampart” serves as an interesting intellectual exercise yet stops short of being an emotional masterpiece
The movie keenly depicts Brown’s attempt to juggle two ex-wives and two daughters as he finds refuge in a flask of brandy behind the wheel of his police car and dishes out a little extra police tough love in the crime-ridden Rampart division. Each scene is shot within the heart of the L.A. hoods, conveying the intensity of the crime within Rampart, the cynical media portrayal of the LAPD, and Brown’s internal turmoil. The lighting is particularly effective, as the screen turns dark and overcast whenever Brown shows his vice-filled nature—overindulging in drugs or women—and fills with daylight whenever he is forced to answer questions from his ex-wives or boss. During the scenes when Brown is confronted about his brutality, the camera switches harshly between interrogator and interrogated, and when Brown’s life and substance abuse whirl out of control, the camera does the same.
Harrelson’s performance as Brown is especially critical in that it brings the setting and story into an environment that is believable to the viewer. It is this believability that causes the movie to strike a chord in the viewer’s mind. The building tension that increases throughout the movie is developed through the media frenzy over the corruption of the LAPD and Brown’s ex-wives’ increasing ostracism; however, although the downfall is fascinating to watch, the film does not succeed in provoking sympathy in the viewer.
For example, the film captures human denial in Brown’s refusal to accept blame for his act of unceasingly beating a man almost to the point of death. Despite the televised evidence of his act and elevation of already significant racial tensions in Rampart, the brazenness of Brown’s insistence that his action displays his dedication to serving as true cop is at first surprising. He even audaciously claims that he “did [the man] a favor instead of shooting him.” Although Brown’s lack of remorse seems rather unbelievable, his character begins to be described by a fellow police officer who tells him, “You think you’re smarter than you are, Dave,” and an old friend of his father who tells him that “Things change, but you don’t.” Brown’s pride and stubbornness are respectively revealed through these two characters’ seemingly simple statements.
With these relatively spartan exchanges, screenwriter James Ellroy’s work can truly be appreciated, and one can come to understand his title as the “Demon Dog of American Crime Fiction.” Brown is shamelessly and violently stripped to the core through other character’s dialogue in his struggle to explain to others the nature of his character.
However, despite the laudable potential of “Rampart” to be a great psychological drama, it leaves a more to be desired. One surely can appreciate the gritty portrayal of one crime-infested Los Angeles neighborhood through the internal turmoil of a man defined by his work in that neighborhood. Sprinkling in moments of witty humor, the film shines in its believability. But although Dave Brown’s struggle is palpable, it fails to leave a lasting impression. The number of scenes in which Brown truly breaks composure to display vulnerability are too few to create sympathy, and the exposition of his faults create too negative a picture to view him as an anti-hero. Thus, audiences will feel that not enough is at stake.

There’s something about a cartoon world that makes a story more lovable, and Japanese production giant Studio Ghibli has stolen hearts once again. In light of his previous works, such as “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away,” screenwriter Hayao Miyazaki had big expectations to live up in “The Secret World of Arrietty.” But Miyazaki effortlessly contributes another timeless and lovable story to the cinematic canon through simple and skilled voice acting, detailed animation, and a light-hearted theme.
“The Secret World of Arrietty” is based on Mary Norton’s “The Borrowers,” a novel about a family of tiny humans who live under the floorboards and borrow small, unimportant items from the humans who live above them. Arrietty (Bridgit Mendler), the only child of the Clock family, unintentionally causes trouble when she is seen by Shawn (David Henrie), a sickly boy who has come to the house of his great-aunt Jessica (Gracle Poletti) to rest his heart before a surgery. The movie details Shawn and Arrietty’s relationship as they fight to keep the Clock family’s existence secret from the inquisitive maid of the home, Hara (Carol Burnett).
First and foremost, it has to be said that this rendition of “The Borrowers” is downright adorable due to its headstrong protagonist. The fearless and naïve Arrietty jumps from one towering plant to the next, collecting leaves and flowers with which she decorates her tiny room. We soon are introduced to Arrietty’s worrisome mother, Homily (Amy Poehler), and her soft-spoken father, Pod (Will Arnett), who complete the Clock family. Against the wishes of her parents, Arrietty finds herself developing a cautious friendship with Shawn, and despite their obvious differences, Arrietty and Shawn soon find that they are very similar.
The central idea that ties “The Secret World of Arrietty” together is this friendship, and though it makes for a charming children’s movie, older viewers might be skeptical. Even the climactic moments are disappointingly clichéd, such as when Arrietty claims, “Sometimes, you have to fight for the things that are worth fighting for,” and “As long as we have each other to live for, we’ll keep on living.” Once again, two characters from different backgrounds predictably put aside their differences and overcome a larger problem. However, this minor criticism comes with the realization that most audience members aren’t watching to twist their minds or to be introduced to novel thematic material.
The animation works well to create a sense of magic to combat adult nihilism. As the story develops, one impressive aspect of the film is the animation’s careful attention to detail. In one respect, this immaculate detail is an unavoidable consequence of animating the tiny world in which the Clock family lives, as the audience sees everyday objects through a magnifying glass. However, this premise in no way downplays the sense of appreciation created by the bulbous raindrops and towering blades of grass that one experiences when from viewing the world three inches from the ground, and in this way the animation goes a step above simply serving as the backdrop of the storyline.
Also commendable is the voice acting, primarily that of the unparalleled Amy Poehler. Poehler phenomenally conveys Homily’s nervous anxiety as she frets and sighs resignedly throughout the film. When Pod is late to come home one night, Homily tiredly says, “Why is my first thought always that he got eaten by the cat? What’s wrong with me?” Burnett also does a great job of voicing Hara, especially as the she begins to take a central role in the plot with a range of emotions that includes mania and defeat. As the voices of the two most hilarious characters in the movie, Poehler and Burnett are perhaps funniest not when they are speaking but making the small exclamations of excitement, worry, or discouragement that are scattered throughout the film.
Thus, “Arrietty” offers its audience an entertaining story populated by likeable characters, humorous villainy, and an over-arching theme of friendship that will appeal especially to young viewers and perhaps even to old.

Rebecca Nadler earned her spot in Harvard skiing history this weekend, winning the giant slalom and becoming the first woman to ever win a collegiate alpine race for the Crimson in EISA competition. Riding Nadler’s performance, Harvard placed ninth overall at the Williams Carnival held Friday through Saturday. The Nordic competition took place in Craftsbury, Vt., while the alpine skiers squared off at Jiminy Peak in Hancock, Mass.
Nadler was able to beat out her competition in the giant slalom by more than a full second, finishing with a time of 1:47.73. Not only did the sophomore alpine skier win the entire event, but she also won both the first and second runs, ending her string of second-place finishes in the giant slalom.
“That’s been my goal for a really long time,” Nadler said. “And to cross the finish line with people cheering and to know that I’d done it was probably one of the happiest days of my life.”
“The fact that Becca won both runs is absolutely incredible,” said Crimson alpine coach Tim Mitchell. “To hear the comments from the other coaches on the side of the hill when she came by, they were like, ‘That’s the win’. They didn’t even need to watch her ski all the way down because she was clearly just that much better on the day.”
Nadler now leads in the giant slalom and overall points for the EISA going into regional championships.
“It was an exceptional achievement, but I’m really not shocked or surprised,” Mitchell said. “She’s that good of a skier, and it’s awesome to see her start to realize that.”
“My team has been awesome.” Nadler said. “We’ve all been working so hard, [and] I was so happy that they were so happy for me. It really meant a lot to have their support.”
Junior Catherine Sheils placed 30th in the giant slalom at 1:55.19. Senior Caroline McHugh and freshman Elizabeth Strong followed up in 37th and 40th place, respectively.
Nadler continued her success over the weekend by finishing in third place in the women’s slalom with a time of 1:37.15.
“I’m generally much stronger in giant slalom, so to have a podium finish in slalom was really awesome.” Nadler said. “I was not expecting that, but again, I think I was just trying to carry over from giant slalom and ski with confidence there too.”
Coming in fourth place overall, the Harvard women’s alpine team was only nine points out of second place but suffered a setback in the slalom when Sheils—one of the Crimson’s top slalom skiers—hit a rut in the course.
“Fourth is great, but we still have those feelings of shades of what could have been,” Mitchell said.
The Harvard men’s alpine team has had to work with a small roster all season but faced an even greater challenge with senior Andrew Spielvogel and sophomore Ian Anderson out for the weekend with shoulder injuries. Senior Kevin McNamara was alone in representing the Crimson in the men’s alpine races and did not qualify for the giant slalom.
Due to a lack of snow, only one of the Nordic races—the men’s 10k classic—took place this weekend. In the event, sophomore Chris Stock had his best result in his collegiate career, finishing in 28:14.2 for a 16th-place finish.
“I’ve been working with my coaches on getting an efficient stride, and this particular course had quite a bit of striding, so I was able to ski fairly well,” Stock said.
“[Chris has] been consistently around 20th all year, so it’s nice to see him moving up at the end of the season.” said Harvard Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “I was pleased with the way he’s skied. It’s a tough field.”
Sophomore Tanner Wiegand earned 61st in the 10k standings with a mark of 31:08.2 and was closely followed by senior teammate Torin O’Brien, who landed in 66th place with his time of 31:53.6.
Junior Alena Tofte continued to have strong results for the Crimson, placing 10th in the women’s 10k classic with a time of 32:18.7. Coming in at 34:02.1, junior Esther Kennedy took 29th.
“It wasn’t necessarily our deepest performance, but I thought it was at the top end,” City said. “It’s nice to see people skiing fast as they were going into the last weekend of the regular season.”
Coming off Nadler’s historic weekend, Harvard will compete in the Middlebury Carnival, which also doubles as the EISA regional championships, next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The new Sleigh Bells album begins with applause. The deafening roar of a stadium crowd builds as vocalist Alexis Krauss screams, “New Orleans! What the fuck’s up?” This mock-live opening track has all the hallmarks of the band’s wildly successful first album, “Treats”: the heavily distorted guitar, the explosive snare-drum hits, and Krauss’s cheerleader-shout vocals. It’s as if nothing has changed.
But “True Shred Guitar” is a false opening. Once the applause has subsided, Krauss and guitarist and producer Derek Miller are finished with congratulating themselves on a job well done on their debut. By the second track, “Born to Lose,” it is clear based just on the first few lyrics that the noise-pop duo has changed immensely: “Heard you say suicide in your sleep / just get on with it / you were born to lose.” This is no longer the band that wrote entire songs consisting of nonsensical lyrics like, “Got my A machines on the table / got my B machines in the drawer.” Sleigh Bells has added depth to the blaring potency that made them famous. While “Reign of Terror” is not as instantly stunning as “Treats,” the sophomore effort exhibits a new maturation.
“Reign of Terror” may lack instant pop appeal, but the album more than makes up for this deficiency in its craft and production. Miller described “Treats” as “party music.” In contrast, “Reign of Terror” is laden with heavy emotion. The shift makes sense: Just before the release of “Treats,” Miller’s father died in a motorcycle accident, and while the band was touring later that year, his mother was diagnosed with cancer.
The album appears to be Miller’s attempt to deal with these tragedies. Its emotional tenor careens wildly, from suicidal to hopeful to wistful to furious. “End of the Line” seems to be written from the concerned, sympathetic perspective—perhaps Krauss’s own—of someone watching a friend grieve: “Just try and talk / you’ll do anything, but you’re never gonna keep it down,” she sings. “Leader of the Pack” borrows its title and chord progression from a 1964 song by the Shangri-Las about a motorcycle accident.  It features the simultaneously despondent and cathartic refrain, “Don’t you know he’s never coming back again?” And even “Demons,” which gets closest to face-kicking levels of raw energy on “Treats,” is tinged with righteous anger. The first half of the album does an impressive job of communicating these volatile emotions without indigestible moroseness.
Unfortunately, the album’s back half starts to sag under the weight of too many mid-tempo power ballads. Krauss’s vocals are normally compelling because of her ability to switch effortlessly from a shoegaze coo to a stadium-rock scream, but in the album’s last few tracks, she settles too comfortably into the former. Tracks like “You Lost Me” and “Never Say Die” are mesmerizing on their own, but they begin to bleed together when placed side by side. The energy of earlier tracks is nowhere to be found, and this monotony means that many people will probably stop listening after “Comeback Kid.”
This is unfortunate, because the last four tracks are full of creative arrangements and compelling lyrics. The album’s bleakest track, “D.O.A.,” is built around a plodding guitar, and “Road to Hell” captures the conflicting emotions of someone who wants to be left alone but desperately needs the support of other people: “Don’t run away from me, baby / just go away for me, baby.”
Ultimately, “Reign of Terror” won’t be blasted out of dorm room stereos nearly as much as its predecessor. But it wasn’t meant to be. “Reign of Terror” proves that Sleigh Bells can still slay.

With 11 seconds left in the game and the Harvard women’s basketball team down three points, junior Emma Golen grabbed the rebound and quickly pushed the ball up the court. After scanning the open floor, she pulled up behind the three-point line and let a shot fly.
But the shot, like many others for the Crimson on Friday night, did not fall, and Golen’s team lost to Brown, 58-55, at the Pizzitola  Memorial Sports  Center.
It was not all bad for Harvard (12-10, 5-3 Ivy), though, as it fought back late to erase a 14-point second-half deficit. The comeback began at the 13:49 mark with junior Victoria Lippert’s three-pointer and lasted until there were 45 seconds left in the game, at which point the Bears (15-8, 6-3) finally managed to capitalize on a Crimson turnover and did not let up the rest of the way.
“They came out ready to go,” Golen said. “They hit a lot of threes that helped them jump out to a big lead that carried over to the second half. We were able to battle ourselves back and make it into a game, but it was just a little too late to be able to pull out the win.”
As was true in the last minute, turnovers proved to be detrimental for Harvard throughout the game. It tallied 20 on the night, the most it has suffered against any Ivy team all year and more than three over its season average. Brown did its most to capitalize off of the giveaways, pushing the ball and scoring 19 points off of the Crimson mistakes.
“Turnovers were huge for us [Friday] night,” Golen said. “I think we were trying to make a lot of quick decisions, quick passes that came back to bite us. They had [19 points off turnovers], so if you want to look at it straight up, that could be the game right there.”
The first half was one of runs between the two teams, but those of the Bears were more numerous and more lengthy than those of Harvard. A little less than half way into the first period, the Crimson took what proved to be its biggest lead of the game when an 8-0 run gave it a 17-11 lead. The remaining 10 minutes of the half were all Brown, and Harvard went into the break trailing, 31-25.
The Bears continued to have success at the start of the second period, as they extended their lead to 14, a game high. At that point, though, the Crimson found Lippert, who did what she does best: hit threes. Lippert nailed her 44th three-point shot of the season, good for third best in the Ivy League. With that basket, momentum appeared to switch to the Crimson.
“We were pushing the ball and started connecting better on offense,” Golen said. “That led us to get those good looks that we should have gotten pretty much the whole game.”
After a quick Bears layup, sophomore Christine Clark was sent to the line and sank two free throws. The next couple of minutes featured each side swapping baskets until freshman Erin McDonnell sunk her second three-pointer of Ivy play with just under five minutes remaining in the game.
“I just relaxed and let the game come to me.… It all became instinctive,” McDonnell said. “I was confident when I went in and knew that I could play with anyone on the floor. I like feeling the pressure.”
With 1:50 to play, the Crimson cut its deficit to five when Golen hit yet another shot from deep. This was followed by a layup from Clark and a free throw by Lippert. But that was as close as Harvard would get, as a missed free throw and a turnover put the ball back in the hands of Brown with 12 seconds left to play. The only thing left for Harvard to do was foul, and it did just that. The Bears made one of two free throws, extending their lead to three, but missed jumpers by Lippert and co-captain Brogan Berry sealed the Brown victory.
Clark led all scorers with 20 points on 7-of-13 shooting, an improvement over last weekend’s 7-for-26 performance.
Despite falling three games behind Princeton in the loss column with the defeat, the Crimson was not turning its back on the possibility of still going for the title.
“We’re looking at it like we’re still in the race,” Golen said. “We’re looking for some revenge in the second half of the season. It is definitely not over.”
McDonnell echoed her teammate’s thoughts, emphasizing redemption as a key factor in the coming games.
“We can still prove ourselves and show everyone else,” McDonnell said. “If we can buckle down and not let any play pass us by, we’re going to prove that we should’ve beaten these teams the first time. We know we can do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quad-based caffeine addicts can once again get their fix in the basement of Cabot House E entryway at Cabot Café, which re-opened Monday night. The café, which started last spring, has been closed since December for renovations.
In December, the college awarded Jesse J. Kaplan ’13, Cabot Café founder and general manager, and the café’s other student leaders $70,000 for renovations. The café has been under construction since then.
Kaplan said that when planning the renovations, they kept in mind student suggestions collected since their grand opening.
“We used customer feedback to drive most of the things that went into our renovation,” said Kaplan,
The new café features comfortable armchairs, more outlets, student artwork, new food and drinks at lower prices, and behind the scenes changes that have created better working conditions for the café’s employees.
“It’s a complete transformation,” said Cabot Café barista Anna M. Menzel ’15. She added that she appreciates the new sinks where employees can wash dirty equipment. Before the renovations, students working at the café loaded the dirty dishes onto carts and brought them upstairs to be washed,
On Monday night at the official café opening, students lined up at the counter hoping to satisfy their late-night cravings.
“The new drinks are super popular,” Kaplan said. “I think that a lot of them are really fun.”
Along with conventional drinks such as teas, espressos, lattes, and hot chocolates, chalkboards on the face of the counter feature more unique selections.
The new menu is divided into caffeinated beverages known as “Keep-me-ups” and drinks without caffeine known as “Pick-me-ups.”
The “Keep-me-ups”  include the “Mocha Loca,” “The Milky Way,” and “The Red Eye.”
Kaplan says he recommends a drink on the “Pick-me-ups” list called “The Cloud 9,” which according to the description is “sure to make any day better.”
Sandhya B. Ghai ’13, said that last year she preferred spending time by the River because of the many food options available.
“In the Quad, it’s so hard, when you’re hungry and studying, to find food,” she said.
Ghai, who lives in Cabot House, said that Cabot Café now gives her a similar option closer to home.
Keeping in mind the concerns of students living in the Quad, Kaplan said that he hopes Cabot Café will be a multi-purpose space for all undergraduates.
“We think it strikes that balance between being a study area and a social space in the quad,” he said.
Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana said he is pleased that the students have followed through with their vision for the space.
“I feel an immense pride in our students for taking responsibility to make something happen to improve the quality of lives for Cabot students and all the undergraduates,” he said. “I feel really inspired by them.”

Sophomore Lyndsey Fry led the charge for the Harvard women’s hockey team with a four-goal performance en route to a 4-0 victory over Yale on Saturday at Bright Hockey Center.
The Harvard women’s hockey team (20-8-1, 17-4-1 ECAC) easily handled the hapless Bulldogs (1-27-1, 1-20-1) on Senior Day to earn the series sweep.
“I think we played with a lot of composure which is something we struggle with sometimes, especially when emotions are high like [Saturday],” Fry said. “I think we played really well together and made the simple passes, and when we did that we had a lot of success.”
After the game, senior Alisha Baumgarter was honored with a video tribute as part of her last regular season game for the Crimson.
“We have been calling it ‘Baumer day’ since she is our only senior,” Fry said. “We wanted to win this one for her and have it be a great finish to the season and hopefully lead a great start to the playoffs.”
Harvard previously defeated the Bulldogs, 8-0, on Jan. 27 earlier this season. The Crimson has dominated the matchup against Yale in recent years, going undefeated in the last 23 games against the Bulldogs.
With the win, Harvard clinched the No. 2 seed in the upcoming ECAC playoffs, where the Crimson will first meet Princeton at home.
“Having that much success and working that well together means a lot heading into the playoffs,” Fry said.
The Crimson got on the board first with a power-play goal by Fry. The sophomore fought for position in front of the net and redirected a shot from the point by junior Josephine Pucci, giving Harvard a 1-0 lead.
Fry added to the lead five minutes later. After freshman Samantha Reber put a shot on net that the goalie initially stopped, Fry was able to take the rebound and flick a shot past the out-of-position netminder.
“I really focused on driving to the net hard,” Fry said. “Samantha had a great shot, and the puck bounced to my stick.”
The Crimson kept pressuring to increase the lead in the period, as junior Jillian Dempsey made two strong moves to put herself in scoring position but ultimately hit the post twice in under a minute.
Yale goalie Genny Ladiges kept the game within reach with 20 saves in the first period.
Harvard again controlled the puck in the second period, outshooting the visitors, 8-1, in the opening eight minutes of play.
The Bulldogs had a chance to pull closer with three Crimson penalties in the first 10 minutes of the frame. But in Yale’s second power play of the period, Harvard turned the short-handed situation into an advantage with Fry gaining control of the puck on a break with only one defender to beat.
Fry, while holding off the Bulldog defender, kept the puck on her backhand before switching to her forehand and lifted a shot past Ladiges, giving the Crimson a commanding 3-0 lead with 11:01 left to play in the frame.
“The Fry-Dempsey-Reber line had a good day,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We moved the puck really well and put a lot of pressure on them by transitioning the puck quickly. We had a strong penalty kill and a shorthanded goal…. A lot of good things happened for us [Saturday].”
But Fry was not finished. In the final frame, Fry added to her hat-trick when she made a well-placed backhanded shot in traffic over the left shoulder of the goalie.
“[Fry] played great. She had a lot of great support, and she put pucks on net, and good things happened for her,” Stone said. “That’s what we are looking for.”
Harvard will now head into the opening round of the playoffs riding a four-game winning streak and will take on Princeton, a squad the Crimson routed in a 10-1 victory on Feb. 4.
“We feel good about where we are,” Stone said. “But this is the end of the regular season, and the postseason is a brand new ballgame.”

Adapting the 1993 British Book of the Year “Wild Swans” to fit both the American and British stage is no easy task. But the ambitious team behind the American Repertory Theater’s and London’s Young Vic Theater’s collaborative project “Wild Swans” succeeds for the most part in overcoming cultural boundaries. The play, adapted from Jung Chang’s book and directed by British director Sacha Wares, follows one family through three generations, highlighting the familial discord caused by Mao Ze Dong’s regime. Running at the Loeb Drama Center until March 11, “Wild Swans” provides an engaging insight into Chinese culture and brings the audience into close contact with the visceral and physical nature of the Chinese Revolution.
Playwright Alexandra Wood took Chang’s 500­-page novel and condensed it into a 100-minute production. The play focuses mostly on the life of De-Hong (Ka-Ling Cheung), a politically radical young Chinese woman who marries a fellow Maoist revolutionary. As she becomes older, the regime she helped to establish turns against her and after the birth of her daughter (Katie Leung), De-Hong is forced to abandon the ideology she once fought so hard to preserve.
Family plays a central role in “Wild Swans,” though this fact was never properly communicated through the acting. The relationships between the family members are considerably weakened by the lack of chemistry between the principal actors onstage, especially with the father of the family, Shou-Yu (Orion Lee). Leung struggles to fully develop the believable relationship with Lee that the script requires. Scenes that ought to be gripping become lifeless. When Er-Hong leaves her father behind in the countryside so she can move to the city, she spends her last moments with him planting seeds in a field. What could be a touching scene that is important for the development of both characters feels like two colleagues ending a stressful day of manual labor together rather than the parting of father and daughter for an unknown amount of time.
The play’s lack of onstage chemistry stands in contrast to its innovative set, which provides “Wild Swans” with some of its most poignant moments. The set itself, designed by Miriam Beuther, shrinks the playing space of the normally expansive Loeb Mainstage. The actors perform in what looks like a living tapestry. The  stage is limited by a very long, shallow box which narrows the performance space to near 2-dimensionality.
The restricting effect of this set design creates a sense of claustrophobia that runs through almost the whole production. At the end of the play, the stage opens up and the shallow set explodes into a maze of mirrors, cubes, and pathways that represent the family’s move from the country to the city. Finally the stage is used to its full capacity, but this sense of liberation only lasts a few short scenes.
The stage is partitioned into different segments, each one representing different locales as the play goes on. Wares provides detailed choreography for the scene transitions—which usually only function as placeholders in between the main points of the play—as a way of illuminating life in Maoist China for the audience. One of the most ambitious transitions involves the ensemble bringing bags of dirt onstage, spreading their contents across the stage to create a field. Moments such as this one provide a real sense of the strenuous labor that characterized a Chinese peasant’s life in the middle of the twentieth century. In order to shift from the field of dirt to a hospital wing, the same ensemble used traditional Chinese farming equipment to clear the stage. These transitions serve to show the cultural transition that China was undergoing during the 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s and informed the rest of the action onstage.
This group of performers brought the real tragedy of the story to life as their scenes show the impact the Cultural Revolution had on the entire country. For example, in one scene a group of students invades the house of the main characters during a protest attacking the supporters of Mao’s Cultural Revolution. It serves as a chilling reminder of the power that radical politics has over its subscribers, and the dangers of fanaticism generally. However, at times they were pushed to less believable extremes, such as a group of revolutionary youths being led in protest by an actor who feels more like a circus clown than a committed Maoist.
“Wild Swans” is, for the most part, a well-executed piece of foward-thinking theater. The cohesion of the onstage society Ware has created is commendable considering the number of people involved in the scene transitions. Despite its flawed acting the production manages to portray the brutality of the Maoist regime due to its physical intensity and technical ambitions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andrew G. Clark is the director of the Holden Choir Program, the oldest collegiate choral program in the United States. He is also the conductor of the Radcliffe Choral Society, the Harvard Glee Club, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum. Clark led the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum in a performance of Rachmaninoff’s “Vespers” on Saturday. He was named director of the Holden Chior Program in May 2010 , succeeding Dr. Jameson N. Marvin.
The Harvard Crimson: Can you tell me a little bit about the upcoming performance of “Vespers”?
Andrew G. Clark: Sure. The Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, a mixed choir of 60 singers, is celebrating [its] 40th anniversary this year. Through the years, they’ve often performed selections or individual movements from “Vespers” but never had an opportunity to perform the work in its entirety. We’re going to be performing the entire work, which is about 60 minutes in length—it’s quite an undertaking.
THC: Besides the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, what other groups do you lead on campus and what’s your role as the director of these groups?
AGC: My role as the director of choral activities includes [leading] the Collegium Musicum, the Harvard Glee Club, the Radcliffe Choral Society, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Chorus. I oversee a staff of five conductors and a choral administrator, and together we teach about 500 Harvard community members.
THC: What inspires you to wake up every morning and teach students at Harvard?
AGC: Passion’s a great word—the first reason is that our students have so much passion. Their level of engagement and excitement and their thirst for not just excellence but for intellectual probing and the refinement of their artistic craft is really what gets me out of the bed in the morning. Music is the focal point but, I would say, not the end goal for our groups. There’s a really beautiful and vibrant supportive sense of community that I think is as much a draw for our students as performance experiences themselves.
THC: Have you always been a conductor? How did you get into conducting?
AGC: When I was a young child, I played piano and sang quite a bit, and I was lucky that I felt like I knew what I wanted to do with my life, which was choral conducting. The opportunities I had in college and in graduate school really affirmed that career path for me.
THC: Did you have any particular influences growing up?
AGC: Before I knew I wanted to go into music, I thought I might want to go into American history. I was very captivated and curious about the Civil War and the music that grew out of that experience. Also, I was introduced as a choral singer to the music of Brahms and Mendelssohn—I can remember those two composers in particular inspiring and fascinating me as a really young person. I was extremely lucky…in my high school to have a teacher and a choral director [who] made a tremendous impact on my life.
THC: Do you have any insight on future of the music scene at Harvard?
AGC: I cannot think of another college or university that offers the students the sheer volume of performance opportunities [that Harvard does]. We have at least three student-led opera companies, all of these orchestras, a dozen or more a cappella groups, music theater, chamber music, choruses—there’s tremendous amount of opportunities. We also benefit from students who come to Harvard with very impressive musical experiences in high school. I think you can leave here after four years with some experiences that are unparalleled.
THC: There has been talk of trying to get Harvard up to par with conservatories. Do you think this is possible?
AGC: Absolutely, and I think our joint program [with the New England Conservatory] is a great first step. What’s attractive about that program is that it’s a five-year program; you’d spend the majority of your time here at Harvard, but you still go work with your private teacher at NEC. Then in your fifth year, you do absolutely nothing but music. My worry is, if a student turned down Juilliard and Curtis, what are we going to do to try to give them a little bit of what that experience might have been like? We don’t teach classes in diction, we don’t teach classes in string bowing technique, we don’t have eurhythmics—there are a lot of things that you can get at a music school that we just can’t get here. I think the NEC-Harvard program is trying to address that head-on.
THC: Is directing choirs at Harvard something you foresee yourself doing for the rest of your career?
AGC: Certainly. There have only been five people in my job since 1900, and legacy is a really big part of what we value in the choral program. It is the oldest collegiate choral program in the U.S., has a remarkable history, and is very well connected with alums. I’m committed to it and really love working here.

Hot Mess
Feb. 24-26, 7:30 p.m., March 1-3, 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Ex
Directed by
Joshua R. McTaggart ’13
Produced by Ally M. Kiley ’14
and Gökan Demirkazik ’14
“Hot Mess” is a fairy tale staged on a catwalk. The performance is built around the surreal, physical connection between twins Twitch (Emily B. Hyman ’13) and Polo (Bryan D. Kauder ’14) who were born with one heart between them. As a result, Polo cannot love and Twitch can do nothing else. The production’s treatment of their shared heart places the show alongside Grimm’s bloodier stories of the fantastic, bypasing the sugared Disney renditions. “It’s interesting to blend the surrealist aspect of the heart between them with the real tragedy—that one of them truly cannot love,” Kauder says. Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, the director and a Crimson arts writer, agrees, suggesting that the fantastical, disturbing elements of the play serve to better illuminate the realistic aspects of the production. “There are fairy tale elements to the play, but they deal with real emotion, real pain, real tragedy,” he says.
However, “Hot Mess” refuses to allow the gravitas of its themes to weigh it down. British playwright Ella Hickson, who wrote the play and will give a pre-show talk on Saturday, March 3, aims to give her script a light touch without diluting its ultimate message. “Hot Mess” attempts to expose our preconcieved notions about love and sex without judgment by giving the audience a sense of responsibility. “What the play provides is this contemporary dialogue on what it means to be in love and have sex,” McTaggart says. Tt is up to the audience to decide what they take from the show, he adds.
The crew of “Hot Mess” makes this connection between viewer and production even more concrete by creating a club atmosphere for the play, with free non-alcoholic beverages served at the door. A catwalk runs through the middle of the space and plays up the party atmosphere of the staging. McTaggart explains the set choice, saying that the play deals with love as performance. Sound designer, Caleb J. Thomson ’14, a Crimson arts writer, makes liberal use of Rihanna’s smash hit “We Found Love.” The youthful energy of the production is a vehicle for the themes of the play: love, sex, and the almost unbearable force of obsession that ties us to them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Is there a place for Carmelo Anthony in New York? Unfortunately for Knicks fans, the first signs are not auspicious.
On Monday night, the Knicks (16-17) lost for only the second time since Jeremy Lin ’10 entered the starting lineup, falling to the New Jersey Nets (10-24), 100- 92. The Nets avenged their loss from Feb. 4, the night that Jeremy Lin introduced himself to the NBA.  Anthony returned to the lineup for the first time since suffering a pulled groin during the Knicks’ 99-88 victory over the Utah Jazz on Feb. 6.
All of New York—well, all of the eyes that weren’t fixed courtside on Jay –Z and Beyoncé—was watching to see how Anthony fit in with the “New York Lins.” In recent days, Anthony has answered questions as to whether he can coexist with the Knicks’ new point guard. Monday’s game did not yield a conclusive answer. Anthony finished with 11 points, six assists, and five rebounds and appeared rusty on the court, tallying a game-high six turnovers.
Meanwhile, Lin continued to fill up the stat sheet for the Knicks.  The Harvard grad and Spike Lee favorite recorded 21 points, nine assists, seven rebounds, and four steals in 36 minutes of play.  Perhaps more importantly, Lin addressed the growing concern about his high turnover numbers, only coughing the ball up three times, well below his average of 6.6.   The overnight sensation achieved yet another career first when he fouled out with 44.9 seconds left in the fourth quarter.
In his post-game interview, Lin blamed the loss on a lack of defensive intensity.
"I think me in particular didn't come with the defensive energy we needed,” Lin said after the game. “Obviously, Deron Williams going for 30-whatever he had is not going to get it done. So I needed to come out with more energy, the team needed to come out with more energy and I think at the end of the day, I think that's why the team lost."
Williams put on a clinic from behind the three-point line, going 8 of 14 from beyond the arc. When it was all said and done, Williams had poured in 38 points, getting revenge against Lin who had dropped 25 points and seven assists off the bench in the previous Knicks-Nets matchup.
Though disappointed by the loss, Knicks’ coach Mike D’Antoni appeared happy with his point guard’s performance.
“That's one of the best guards in the league,” D’Antoni said after the game. “Jeremy still got 21 and nine. He had a great game, good game. Deron had a great game and that'll be that way sometimes. Again, I'm not big on the matchups just because it's a team thing, and as a team we just didn't perform very well."
There is still plenty of time for ‘Melo to prove that he can play with his new co-star.  Anthony’s next opportunity is on Wednesday, when the Knicks host the Atlanta Hawks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Dorchester caucus-goers filed into the library of the Christo Rey High School in Savin Hill last week, volunteers from the remaining Democratic U.S. Senate campaigns urged them to support their candidate.
Marisa DeFranco, an immigration attorney running for U.S. Senate, was the only candidate trying to sway caucus-goers in person.
“I ask everyone to keep an open mind. This is a long process,” she said. “I am staying in the race.”
But most of the Democrats caucusing here, and in other working-class neighborhoods across the city, are supporting Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, not DeFranco, to take on Republican Senator Scott Brown this fall.
Of the 14 delegates plus alternates who will represent Dorchester, the majority said they will endorse Warren at the Democratic Convention this June.
To make it onto the ballot in next September’s primary, candidates will need the endorsement of 15 percent of delegates, who are chosen at caucuses across the state this month.
“I think Marisa [DeFranco] sounds like she would be a good candidate in another race,” said Betsy Miessner, a first time delegate, after the caucus had concluded.
Miessner, wearing a “Warren for Senate” sticker on her jacket, first heard about the Harvard Law School professor years ago when she wrote columns on personal finance for the website TalkingPointsMemo.com. Miessner began following Warren’s column for advice on how to deal with student loans that she had accrued, and has been a supporter ever since.
“She really gets what’s going on with people’s lives,” Miessner says. “She knows what the middle class’s issues are.”
Marion Haddad, a 12-time delegate and former staffer for the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54- ’56, said that she was excited by Warren’s strong background in consumer protection.
When asked if Warren fit the mold her former boss and the famed political family created, Haddad fell silent for a moment. “No,” she said, “but she’s close.”
Though it seems that Warren has secured the vote of many working-class Democrats for the primary, her potential in these key demographics during the general election is still unclear. To do what former candidate and Attorney General Martha M. Coakley failed to do in the last senatorial election, Warren will have to overcome Brown’s popularity and a disillusionment with Democrats that has taken root among this demographic.
“People have made up their mind on Scott Brown,” Democratic analyst Michael Goldman said. “A lot of people still have to decide if his opponent is someone they want to replace him with.”
BLUE-COLLAR BATTLEGROUNDS
Democratic leaders from Boston’s working-class wards have said that Warren will fare well in the general election among voters from their districts.
“I think what’s appealing about her to people in Dorchester is her work. I think a lot of people connect to her work in Washington, and also her upbringing. She grew up in a working family and tried to make something of herself,” said State Representative Martin J. Walsh, who represents Dorchester.
Charlestown Democrat Jack Kelly, who organized his neighborhood’s caucus, said that Warren will likely take Charlestown because the presidential election will drive many Democrats to the polls. He added that all but one of the delegates at his caucus will endorse Warren.
The nature of the support Warren has found in the historically blue-collar Democratic neighborhoods concurs with what political experts and analysts have said for months: the race with Brown, like the one two years ago, will be won on the basis of who can best connect with middle and working-class voters.
“Ultimately, in the end, she has to go in that room in Dorchester and convince the people in the room that even though she’s a Harvard professor who’s worked in Washington and made a bunch of money, she understands them, that she cares about them and will fight for them,” Goldman said.
In the 2010 special election, Brown was able to translate his relatability into votes. In South Boston, Charlestown, and parts of Dorchester, Brown drew a significant number of votes from social conservatives and so-called Reagan Democrats—groups that have drifted toward the Republican Party during the past few decades.
This demographic feels as if it has been “completely pushed out of the conversation,” Kelly said. “They don’t like Republicans, but I think they feel like they represent their emotional interests.”
Brown upset Coakley in wards 6 and 7—the heart of Southie—and lost by a slim margin in the historically Democratic Charlestown.
“He does connect to people. I can’t take that away from him,” Walsh said. “But he didn’t grow up in Dorchester. He was on Cosmopolitan as a model. You can identify with the denim jacket but not with Cosmopolitan Magazine.”
“He basically said ‘I’m more like you than she is,’” Goldman said. “‘I get it; she doesn’t.’”
Goldman added that though it will not be easy for Warren to beat out Brown in these crucial wards, her populist message and modest background has resonated well with this segment of the electorate during the first five months of her campaign.
“She is really the first time in a long time you have every element of the Democratic party believing they have something they want to see in a candidate,” said Goldman. “So if you’re educated, if you’re a woman, if you’re a guy who’s living in a three decker, you like her. There’s very little they can attack her on because her career has been based on taking her skill set, turning around, and helping those behind her in the food chain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team (10-1) swept through Ivy League rivals Yale (4-3), Dartmouth (8-1), and Brown (8-3) en route to capturing its third ECAC title in the past four years this weekend in Hanover, N. H.
“This tournament was a good test to see where our team was in the Ivies,” said freshman Shaun Chaudhuri, who is now 8-0 in singles play. “I felt that as a team we performed really well. This was a good team effort.”
Strong singles play was a theme all weekend for Harvard, as the team won 10 of its 13 matches with a lineup that features four freshmen and only one returning starter from last year.
“The singles lineup is strong all the way through to the last guy,” Pearlman said. “There is not a lot of disparity from court one to court six, and with our depth, it has been tremendously helpful in putting pressure on other teams on a lot of courts.”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 1
The Crimson entered the championship round on Monday confident after a strong showing in the first two rounds. On the back of four single’s victories, it earned the ECAC championship title after a 4-1 victory over the Bears.
“It’s hard to stay focused over a multiple-day tournament, especially when there are four matches being played per day and you don’t know when you will get on the court,” senior Jonathan Pearlman said. “This win speaks to the mental fortitude of our team.”
In doubles play, the duo of freshman Denis Nguyen and junior Andy Nguyen and the pairing of freshman Alex Steinroeder and sophomore Christo Schultz both lost, costing Harvard the doubles point and the early lead.
But despite the 1-0 deficit, the Crimson was able to grab four straight victories and the ECAC title.
On the No.1 court, Pearlman dominated Brown’s Brandon Burke, 6-2, 6-3, while Harvard got a lift from its four through six courts once again. Shultz and freshmen Henry Steer and Shaun Chaudhuri all dominated their matches en route to a team victory.
HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 2
Facing the Big Green in the second round of play, Harvard captured three more singles victories to keep its championship hopes alive and advance to the finals, winning, 4-2.
The Crimson began the match strong, securing the overall doubles point for the team.
The duo of Steinroeder and Schultz easily handled Xander Centenari and Chris Ho, winning their match, 8-4, while the Nguyen duo also contributed an 8-3 win to secure the overall point.
In singles, Chaudhuri continued his winning streak by defeating Ho in a three-set battle, 7-6, 4-6, 6-1.
Pearlman also took care of business on the No. 1 court, topping Centenari, 6-4, 6-0.
After Steinroeder and Denis Nguyen both lost their matches, Schultz was able to squeak out a victory against Chris Kipouras in a three set thriller 6-3, 7-6, 14-12, giving Harvard the four points needed for the victory that sent them to the finals against Brown.
HARVARD 4, YALE 1
In the first round, the top-seeded Crimson breezed by the eighth-seeded Bulldogs with a 4-1 victory.
After the doubles pairing of Denis Nguyen and Andy Nguyen for the Crimson defeated Yale’s Erik Blumenkranz and Joel Samaha, 9-8, Harvard secured an overall team point with Schultz and Steinroeder’s 8-6 win over John Huang and Patrick Chase.
The Crimson entered singles play with a one-point advantage but dropped an early singles match at the No. 3 spot when Steinroeder fell to Yale’s Daniel Hoffman, 6-1, 6-4.
Harvard was able to rally and grab three consecutive victories with wins on the fourth through sixth courts.
On the No. 6 court, Chaudhuri remained undefeated in singles plays this year, topping Bulldog Kyle Dawson in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6.
Schultz carried momentum from his doubles victory, dominating, 6-1, 6-2, while Steer also defeated Yale’s Joel Samaha, 6-1, 7-5, in order to capture the fourth team point for Harvard and secure the victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last semester, when I had to write an educational curriculum for an elementary school tutoring program, I picked the topic of color. I bought a prism for the occasion to show the kids that rainbow-wedge Dark-Side-of-the-Moon effect—how a single, pure beam of white light is dispersed into a wide rainbow of color when shown through a triangular prism. I forgot a flashlight, so we tried using the flashlight function on another tutor’s iPhone. But when we shone it through the prism it cast a distressingly truncated rainbow, mostly white with a blue edge. Of course, we should have known: The output spectrum of color is only as good as the input spectrum of the iPhone light.
Computer screens can display even less of the full range of the color spectrum. Our screens’ colors are all the result of combinations of a certain red, a certain blue, and a certain green light—a small triangle on the irregular parabola of visible colors. Computers do a slightly better job with shades on the red end of the spectrum, but there is a deep range of blues and greens that computers cannot display.
This is an issue when it comes to viewing art, movies, and photography on a computer or some other small screen. As filmmaker David Lynch remarked in an interview for the limited edition DVD of his 2006 film, “Inland Empire,” “Now, if you’re playing the movie on a telephone, you will never in a trillion years experience the film. You’ll think you have experienced it, but you’ll be cheated. It’s such a sadness, that you think you’ve seen a film on your fucking telephone. Get real.” So what is the right kind of art to experience on a phone or on a computer?
I think I have found one answer in a Youtube video called “Hotpoint Washer Tears Itself Apart—Grand Final Day Entertainment,” which displays what poster Aussie50 describes as the “washing machine kill cycle.”  The video shows a nondescript front-loading washing machine sitting in someone’s yard on an overcast day. The clothes chamber starts spinning—Aussie50 appears to have replaced the original motor with a more powerful one—and, based only on the force of the spinning, the washing machine gradually tears itself apart. Pieces start bucking and flying off, then the door, and finally the spinning motor falls down flat.
Another piece of perfect internet art was the gender-guessing quiz of the early 2000s, which is no longer online. The quiz involved a number of questions not at all related to gender, things like, “Which word is worse, ‘used’ or ‘moist’?,” and “Which do you prefer, French fries or onion rings?” At the end, the program guessed your gender, which you then confirmed—and the force of thousands of quiz-takers answering these inane questions pushed the likelihood of a correct guess to close to 100%.
A final example is the music and pop culture blog Hipster Runoff. Written by the self-styled Carles, the blog is a bewildering compendium of text-speak and ceaseless irony, tempered by Carles’ profound—even lovingly excessive—knowledge of his subjects. The blog presents such a dire idea of the modern world that I cannot read it for long—like Madame Bovary’s italics, Carles uses quotation marks around idiomatic, popular expressions, which turn out to be almost everything. Everything is inescapably silly. The most bloggable bits rule the world. But even this ridiculously insincere world has its moments of beauty: “I like ‘looking forward to things,’” writes Carles about an Animal Collective album, “because it is a gimmick that makes my life worth living.”
These three different artworks—artworks in worldview and effect, if not in named intention—reveal what art works on the internet. Lushly visual art and art that works with physical experience is out—imagine trying to take a Google Maps tour through a Richard Serra piece. The best internet art is collective and interactive in a way peculiar to its medium and works with the quiet, personal, and slightly guilty state of its consumers. There is no self-satisfaction to the internet the way there is to a book or a museum.
One of the best things about the internet format, and what links it to street art, is its capacity for surprise. “Hotpoint Washer Tears Itself Apart” begins on the level of all other YouTube videos, and in five minutes distinguishes itself, working entirely within the constraints of its medium. It works because of its content—the surprising pathos and galactic-scale entropy contained in an average washing machine—and also because this act of technological self-destruction can only be experienced with technology. What does it matter if Aussie50 was intending to make art? We should open ourselves to all of it. The internet’s limitlessness makes it a truly exciting stage for art—instead of that one monkey tapping out Shakespeare, we now have more than two billion.

Members of Harvard’s Islamic community expressed dismay over the Associated Press news report released Saturday stating that the New York Police Department had monitored the activities of Muslim students and professors in at least sixteen colleges in the Northeast, including three Ivy League schools. Harvard was not specifically mentioned in the report.
The investigations, which took place primarily in 2006 and 2007, ranged from questioning local law enforcement officials about professors at the University of Buffalo to sending an undercover agent on a whitewater rafting trip attended by Muslim students studying at the City College of New York.
One secret NYPD document dated Nov. 22, 2006 and obtained by the AP states that an undercover officer visited gatherings of Muslim student groups at Yale, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania and also monitored the groups’ websites, blogs, and forums. The officer reported finding “no significant information.”
In defense of the NYPD’s surveillance program, police spokesperson Paul Browne told the AP that twelve individuals have been either arrested or convicted on terrorism charges in the United States who previously participated in Muslim student groups.
Although Browne told the AP that the investigations at universities concluded in 2007, the AP reports that documents indicate that the surveillance continued beyond that point.
Ali Asani, professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures, said he was not surprised by the AP’s report because of “the culture of fear that has come to characterize the contemporary American political scene—particularly the fear of Islam and of Muslims.”
Ana R. Nast ’12, president of the Harvard Islamic Society, said that she believes that the NYPD’s actions violated Muslim students’ and professors’ rights to privacy.
But she added that “it’s encouraging to see that the amount of support that the Muslim community receives” in response to what she perceives as inappropriate increased surveillance.
Muneeb Ahmed ’14, director of External Relations for HIS, said he was concerned by the NYPD’s investigation and said that it promotes an already troubling stereotype.
“These are hardworking college students,” Ahmed said. “The NYPD should not be wasting its resources in this way.”Asmaa Rimawi ’14, vice president of HIS, echoed her fellow HIS members, calling the NYPD’s actions “a huge setback.”
Rimawi said that she hopes HIS will be able to work with University administrators to maintain an environment that supports the rights of Muslim student groups.
According to group leaders, the HIS fosters a religious and social community on campus with events including biweekly dinners, group discussions, and Islamic Awareness Week in the spring semester.
The group has no political or ideological agenda, Ahmed said.
Asani, who is also the Chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, suggested that Harvard should “take all steps to make sure that the civil liberties and freedom of expression of not only Muslim students but also Muslim faculty will be protected.”University administrators could not be reached for comment on the AP’s report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College brought the 14th Annual Walter J. Leonard Black Arts Festival into the greater community with their theme “Living for More Than Just Me.” With funk and compassion, black artists at Harvard put the focus on minority youth in the Boston community, and a large portion of the proceeds from the event were donated to sustaining arts programs for Boston youth. “We’ve seen the impact that [art] has had on our lives, and we know that it can be a positive outlet,” said Amarachi I. Erondu ’15, the financial chair of Kuumba’s Black Arts Festival board. This year, the festival provided a space for young black artists to perform and share their talent.
“In this music that you’re creating, there is no limitation, and you can do whatever you want to do,” said Ikenna Acholonu, a mentor to youth in the Boston area, during the panel discussion at the festival, which ran from Thursday to Saturday. Acholonu reminded students that sometimes society limits the potential of students of color. “You have a lot of stuff stacked against you regardless if you try hard,” he said. He was one of four people who were asked by the Black Arts Festival board to speak about the importance of arts education for minority students. The others were Anyenda Inyagwa, a graduate of Tufts University who now works in various youth programs in Boston; Farai Williams, the artistic director of Project HIP-HOP; and Noni D. Carter ’13, a junior at Harvard whose book “Good Fortune” was published two years ago.
Over three days there were five events, all focused on the same theme. The festival kicked off on Thursday with “Sing it, Sister,” a free event at the Queen’s Head Pub featuring black female vocalists, and ended with a performance on Saturday at the Cabot House Underground Theater featuring black youth from BlackCAST’s Teen Empowerment program, performances from Harvard students from Speak Out Loud, and other monologues by minority students at Harvard. All of the events had a common theme: The arts are an important outlet through which minority students can express themselves freely. “The arts are carriers of cultural memory, and we need to be a part of creating what that is,” Farai Williams said in the panel discussion.
The other speakers present certainly had similar missions in mind. Carter spoke about the impact her book has had on African American students, both in her hometown in Georgia and in Boston public schools, where she has been asked to speak many times. She said that there is a lack of black mentors in our history textbooks, and that part of her mission in educating students through her book was to share her great-great-great grandmother’s slave journey with those around her whom she found to be ashamed of their African American slave history.
The main act was a benefit showcase on Friday at the Roxbury Community College Mainstage Theater. “We’re hoping to fill 500 seats,” said Ada D. Lin ’14, another member of the festival’s board. Lin is from the Boston area, and she benefitted from arts programs in the Boston public schools growing up. These programs lack funding, Lin said, a problem that the showcase aimed to remedy. Kuumba donated most of the proceeds to the Tobin Community Center in Roxbury, an organization that provides after-school arts programs for Boston youth. “The more people you have to look up to, the brighter your future will be,” Lin said.
As such, this year’s Black Arts Festival sought to provide new mentors for Black youth. On Friday, a group from Kuumba ran a workshop for 50 eighth-grade students to talk about Black music and Black History Month in a Roxbury public school. Harvard students shared their experiences and offered themselves as examples of how to express oneself through art. “Growing up I never had black mentors,” Acholonu said. “The first black mentors I received were in college.”
The Black Arts Festival hopes to establish a pattern of giving back to the community. “It’s our responsibility to continue inspiring and uplifting,” Carter said. By collaborating with other black organizations on campus, the Black Arts Festival highlighted the necessity of role models for youth and the importance of keeping art in public schools. Kuumba hopes to continue this mission by providing Boston youth with a continued outlet for expression and will keep this mission in mind when brainstorming themes for next year’s Black Arts Festival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I first thought of Van Morrison’s “Astral Weeks” as the noise of a drunk determinedly rummaging for something in a room filled with musical instruments. As he digs, acoustic guitars thrum and violins quake; a flute falls and catches the wind just so. He pushes deeper into the room and knocks over a vibraphone—several times—and through it all he mutters to himself about what he has lost.
When I first heard the album, I’d already listened to it several times. I’d reversed Van Morrison’s line of influence, working from Springsteen’s guileless “Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.”-era emulations back to Morrison’s own “Moondance” and only then, after these and other derivations and precursors, to the confounding “Astral Weeks” itself. The night I first understood “Astral Weeks,” I was cold in the dark back seat of my family’s car, looking out the fogged window as we became helplessly lost en route to a Christmas party.
As the disc finished and looped back to the beginning, I began to find the music inexplicably appropriate to that moment. “If I ventured in the slipstream,” sings Morrison on the titular first track, “between the viaducts of your dream…could you find me…lay me down in silence easy to be born again?” A bass and shaker bob and amble as the guitar noodles endlessly like it’s searching for a part. Midway through the pulsing song, Morrison begins to rattle off impressions like a musical Leopold Bloom. The instrumentation then begins to crystallize around a sighing string pattern. As the strings rise once more, Morrison suddenly belts, “And here I am,” but what he actually says is, “EHiiiYaaaaaallllAaaahm.” For a measure, the song’s impossibly convoluted instrumentation converges around Morrison’s purposeful ineloquence. I realized then that Morrison was searching, too. “I’m nothing but a stranger in this world,” he hazily reflects as the song settles, “I got a home on high…so far away.” He laughs and whispers as the song fades, his lines gamboling about one another.
From then on, I have thought of Morrison’s music as a journey. Greil Marcus articulates this element of searching better than I could hope to in his book “When That Rough God Goes Riding”: “There is in his music from the very first a kind of quest: for the moment when the magic word, riff, note, or chord is found and everything is transformed.” In Irish culture, a voice at that moment is called the yarragh—“the voice that strikes a note so exalted you can’t believe a mere human being is responsible for it, a note so unfinished and unsatisfied you can understand why the eternal seems to be riding on its back,” as Marcus writes. In short, this is the “EHiiiYaaaaaallllAaaahm” that would mean “And here I am” whether or not those were the words Morrison meant to sing. These are the best moments in Morrison’s music—split seconds of sheer joy mingled with unbarred hurt and acceptance when it seems as if he has been using words as placeholders for the deeper meaning that only his fully summoned voice can convey.
That Morrison’s joy cannot be articulated easily is understandable. He had not led a happy life when he recorded “Astral Weeks” in 1968.  After a successful yet somehow unpopular career in Ireland, Morrison came to Cambridge, Mass., to seek his fame. The United States, however, treated him no better.  Legal matters kept him out of the studio, and he took the impasse poorly, angrily enduring a creative dry spell and a bitter attempt at his deportation. Yet this darkness forms the rough-hewn edge to every joyful moment his later work achieves. If there were a universal trope of joyful music, it would be the phenomenon of mounting tension and ecstatic release. Morrison’s voice collapses this arc into a tension that is always present: Though he may triumphantly belt his choruses, it is with the same voice that, kept from song, incessantly called Boston radio DJs with slurred demands for old blues music in the late ’60s.
The lyrics of “Astral Weeks” help explain why he can sound so joyous. The words vaguely call to someone to find him—a “stranger in the world”—so he can be born again. The instrumentation is loose because it too is searching for the build that allows Morrison to unleash his cry of, “Here I am.” These moments of joy, then, are times when Morrison is inescapably himself—a stranger in the world briefly glimpsing his home on high. It is a pure reassurance of music’s potential to be intrinsically joyful, and it is in these depths of understanding and acceptance beyond language that a listener’s soul responds with like joy; that we become strangers in the world, together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a sad truth that our culture does not compensate artists very generously. For some unintelligible reason, being able to choose the right stock is more desirable and profitable than being able to chose the right turn of phrase. This system of valuation has divided aspiring young professionals into two camps: those who want to be creative in their careers, and those who don’t—or, more crudely, those who do not care much about making money, and those who rather fancy a decent salary. The financial crisis and the ailing job market it brought with it have pitted these two camps against each other. The veiled disdain artistic people once had for those who chose more lucrative paths has been replaced by hostility. As a junior in the thick of the summer job search frenzy, I am acutely aware of the contempt the self-appointed “artsy elite” have for those seeking lucrative internships. I have heard the terms “soul-seller,” “sell-out,” and several which The Crimson could not print applied to people aiming at more conventionally remunerative careers.
To repudiate financial motives so thoroughly one must either already be quite well-off or truly devoted to lofty artistic ideals at the expense of material comfort. Needless to say, at Harvard I find the former to be the case more frequently. This is not to say that those who choose to pursue financially unrewarding careers in arts are all rich brats—far from it. I have nothing but admiration for those who prioritize artistic fulfillment over financial security. It is just to say that it is a lot easier to condemn careers in finance or management consulting if you don’t have to worry about paying bills.
At college, almost all of our immediate needs—food, lodging, gym membership—are taken care of by the invisible hand of our parents, our aid packages, or some combination of the two. Most of us are in that blissful state of quasi-independence (i.e. quasi-dependence) in which we are liberated both from parental control and financial burden. I have a part-time job, but it pays an infinitesimal fraction of the cost of my attending Harvard. Basking in this Eden of free independence, it is tempting to behave as though money doesn’t matter. “I don’t care how much I make so long as I like what I do,” is the self-assured refrain of the idealistic undergraduate. But we must all taste the bitter fruit of reality sooner or later. Money does matter. It matters a lot.
In America, which unlike the United Kingdom does not possess the remnants of an ancient class system, the hyper-rich are the hyper-elite. Whereas in the U.K. we Brits have the titled landed gentry—who, incidentally, are often impoverished, in the U.S. we have business tycoons whose net worth has purchased them social cachet. This distinction is perfectly illustrated by two shows whose popularity has soared in recent months: “Revenge” and “Downton Abbey.”
I watch both shows religiously, although my reverence for “Downton” is undoubtedly more pious. Though set in radically different worlds, both shows examine the dramatic potential of money and class. Just as I maintain that the financial crisis pitted the artsy against the money-minded, it also brought about a deep suspicion for those individuals who became very rich from doing nothing, or nothing that the average person could make sense of at any rate. Both the Earl of Grantham and Conrad Grayson, protagonists of “Downton Abbey” and “Revenge,” respectively, fall under this category, though for different reasons. The Earl of Grantham inherited all his wealth and says unabashedly in several episodes that the upkeep of his estate is his “life’s work.” He did not build Downton Abbey. He just woke up one day and had a huge mansion, acres upon acres of land, and a staff large enough to field several football teams. (I mean soccer teams. I have no idea how many people are on an American football team.)
Conrad Grayson is no heir but a highly motivated, ruthless financier who has created the massive Grayson Global empire. Yet he, too, has not built any of the luxury that surrounds him. Rather, his wealth comes from manipulating mind-numbing sums of money that wealthy individuals place in his care. Both these men have never produced anything tangible. This, I think, is what is reviling artistic people for whom creating a work is paramount. The artsy elite aims to produce, to perform, to present—to put art out into the world, however few or many its consumers. The work of the hyper-elite caricatured in “Downton” and “Revenge” is decidedly immaterial.
Despite this disdain or hostility toward the passive accumulation of wealth, it would seem that this climate of acute financial crisis has only intensified our desire to observe the lives of the hyper-elite. And artists, too, can obsess over this fictional world of passive affluence, as long as it is so comfortably distant, contained behind a screen.

The floor is littered: torn-up cardboard advertising earmuffs, the vandalized arm of a wooden chair, hats and helmets of all varieties, and a bird-embellished hanging lamp highlight an unmatched curio collection.
These items occupy the Sert Gallery in the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts as one part of Annette Lemieux’s “Unfinished Business” exhibit, a companion to her traveling retrospective “The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux.” Her piece, “Things to walk away with,” is upstairs in the Sert Gallery, and the six other pieces in “Unfinished Business” are installed in the Carpenter Center’s main gallery. The exhibit will be on display in until April 1.
The impetus for the collection was a pair of unfortunate events in Lemieux’s life: A tree fell into her backyard and she was evicted from her studio of 20 years. The result was an excavation of her past works and the emotions accompanying their inspiration.
Where one might simply see an auction list for a late 20th-century edition of popular item-collecting television shows “Pawn Stars” or “Hoarders,” Lemieux explored the meaning behind what D.N. Rodowick, interim director at the Carpenter Center, called “the poetry of objects.” She sees the universality of history and memory that could be invoked through personal connotations, and this theme is especially poignant in “Things to walk away with.”
“The objects have a relationship to my past works or experiences and also their own histories or stories, some even unknown to me. They are alive for me.  They are not nature morte­—they are not inanimate,” Lemieux said. She highlights the importance of these histories by arranging the objects in a certain way.
In the case of “Things to walk away with,” Lemieux is careful to arrange the objects in a certain way. “The objects were arranged according to height, so [as] not to get caught up in formal concerns, or to create unique juxtapositions,” Lemieux said. “Due to the objects’ placement by height, there were interesting juxtapositions that I didn’t invent.” This exemplifies the way in which Lemieux acts as a conceptual artist who works from an idea to create a finished product. It is her approach to her work and the space she creates for a knowledgable audience that communicates meaning to the viewer.
“La Itala Laborposteno” meaning “The Italian Job” in Esperanto is comprised of seven prints, four in black and white and three in primary colors with post-apocalyptic words in Esperanto formatted using WordArt. The pieces are tagged with words like “Monstruo” and “Flugsoldato” (meaning “monster” and “paratrooper,” respectively) to evoke her idea that humanity is destined for self-inflicted doom. The use of mirroring in some prints helps to enforce this idea of fighting against ourselves. The narrative on which it is based does not deal directly with the way we interpret the world via symbols, which differentiates this from the other works in the exhibit. While it might seem out of place, this work shows off Lemieux’s versatility in expressing different themes.
Curator Lelia Amalfitano claims that the exhibit’s primary function is to introduce viewers to Lemieux’s creative process, from the identification of specific objects to their integration into a statement reflecting human memory and culture-shaping. This approach is more tailored to already-established fans of Lemieux’s work because it seems to lack a coherent unifying thread to connect the disparate approaches and symbols she employs, which new viewers might need in order to fully appreciate what is otherwise a novel approach to making art.
Lemieux is somewhat limited by the sheer overwhelming nature of the themes she is tackling, themes that cannot ostensibly be understood in such few pieces. Knowledgeable viewers will appreciate the diverse lenses she supplies to analyze our material culture. She also creates a holistic message that is enforced through its composite parts. “Unfinished Business” was created using a very introspective approach, which exemplifies Lemieux’s ability to invite the audience to share in what is for her a very personal experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What’s worse than a student slaving away an entire summer—day in and day out—just to put something creditable on his or her resume? Not getting paid for it.
As winter fades away and spring begins anew, so does the mad dash for students to secure a summer internship. Unfortunately, unpaid summer internships have become the new norm in recent years. With youth unemployment hovering near 16 percent and entry-level jobs becoming increasingly scarce, employers now have the power to dictate the terms of summer employment. This boils down to good old-fashioned economics: Given that market supply of labor greatly outstrips demand, employers can both be extremely picky with whom they decide to bring on board and also get away with not compensating students for their time and energy.
The hypercompetitive job market for graduating students further amplifies this problem. Students looking to obtain a job post-graduation compete not just on their education, but more now than ever, on their work experience. Consequently, students are often willing to gain experience in a working environment regardless of whether they are paid or not.
Don’t get me wrong, paid internships still exist—but they are rare. About two-thirds of the jobs listed on Internships.com are unpaid. Those able to obtain paid positions, which can sometimes be utilized as either a stepping stone to a full-time job or consist of formal professional training, are the lucky few.  The once well-intentioned, paid summer training experience is becoming a relic of the past.
But students in these unpaid internships are not the only ones feeling their effect—the economy as a whole is hurting because of them.  Workers willing to take unpaid internships (typically privileged students with stable parental financial support) replace thousands of other qualified employees who cannot afford to work for free. These workers, without a job or some kind of income, must rely on the government to subsidize their living. And by government, I mean you, me, and every other taxpayer.
This system has the added effect of barring underprivileged students from participating in unpaid internships since they simply cannot afford to work for free. But there are broader effects produced by this type of internship boom, chiefly, constricted social and professional mobility and growing economic inequality.
Yet, there is hope!
I see three ways in which our present day internship system can be improved. First, as Ross Perlin, author of Intern Nation has suggested, industries, employers, and colleges at the heart of the internship system can police themselves. This would require that these players create a system defined by enforceable internship standards. Second, employees, parents, teachers, and even the government can collectively take a stand against employers that engage in poor work practices. This combined pressure may be enough to nudge employers to offer better compensation for summer internships.
Finally, if neither of these comes to fruition, the responsibility to ultimately correct the market failures in the system falls solely on the government. Government watchdogs will need to be formed and then set loose to snag any employers that do not comply with government mandated and improved internship standards. Given the widespread effects of unpaid internships on society as a whole, it would only make sense for the government to level the playing field as a last resort.
As a student currently working toward securing a summer position, I can only hope that my summer isn’t defined by yet another unpaid internship.
