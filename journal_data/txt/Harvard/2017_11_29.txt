“I’m searching for phrases to sing your praises.”
The rhyme rang out across Agganis Arena on the night of Nov. 16, accented by the unmistakable singing style of Bob Dylan—icon and iconoclast, ever-changing, ever-constant inventor of popular musical history, and master of folk, rock, country, religious, political, allegorical, epic narrative, and plaintive lyrical song. More recently, Dylan, always surprising, has become a late convert to the performative pleasures and poetry of the American songbook, and, along the way, won the U.S. Medal of Freedom (2012) and the Nobel Prize in Literature (2016). The 76-year-old Dylan continues to travel the world over, as he has since 1988, in what has been dubbed by others the “Never Ending Tour.” In this unprecedented, largely unheralded commitment to performing his craft nearly nightly, Dylan remains true to perhaps the greatest constant of his career—in addition to his inexhaustible melodic and lyric gifts—his steadfast dedication to his own interests as a musician.
The many dimensions and voices of Bob Dylan impersonated by others in Todd Haynes’ cleverly titled “I’m Not There” were all there that Thursday night, as Dylan and his band performed now-classic songs spanning the length of his career, from “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “Desolation Row” to his more recent Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett covers, such as “Melancholy Mood” and “Once Upon a Time.” Blues and gospel great and civil rights activist Mavis Staples, who first encountered Dylan 55 years ago, was on hand to open for him, and at 78 years old brought the house down with hits like “I’ll Take You There,” as well as anthems of the Selma marches.
While Staples spoke openly to the audience, Dylan took pains to conceal himself (or be himself) in the music: He never spoke, and was hidden during transitions between songs by short blackouts. As a result, from the embittered ex-lover of “It Ain’t Me Babe” to the cool social critic of “Ballad of a Thin Man,” his many selves emerged with startling clarity. His orchestrations, too, changed majestically, from the R&B feel of “Highway 61” to the Hawaiian sound of the slide guitar in his most recent covers, such as “Why Try and Change Me at All?” to a giddy, country-western mood emphasized by Donnie Heron on mandolin and fiddle.
Illuminated by simple but very effective golden, red and yellow lights positioned across the back of the stage, dressed in a white jacket identical to those of the band, and seated—or standing, bow-legged—for much of the show at a grand piano (Dylan has played keyboards in his concerts for years, supposedly because he can’t find anyone else who will play simply enough), Dylan’s only visible mark of distinction was his trademark halo of wild hair. With the exception of the slanted-mic, Elvis posture he adopted to stand center-stage, Dylan avoided appearing the show headliner entirely.
Although the intelligibility of some of his lyrics were sacrificed to his trademark gravelly voice, certain lines rang out with sudden clarity. To use the comparison between Dylan and the Classics propounded by Richard Thomas of Harvard’s Classics Department (who missed the concert to promote his new book on Dylan at Case Western Reserve University), these extracts, shimmering in their unlikely intelligibility, stood out a little like surviving fragments of Sappho’s poetry.
Dylan’s speak-singing of his own songs seemed to grant him even greater interpretive freedom. For someone who conceives of performing as a job like any other—“Anyone with a trade can work as long as they want,” he has said, “A welder, a carpenter, an electrician”—Dylan, remarkably, maintains his sense of creative freedom even when singing songs he has performed since the ’60s. What makes a Dylan concert thrilling to this day is this: After all this time, it is eminently clear that this “song and dance man” for the ages continues to live in his art, plying his craft on a stage, and “searching for phrases.”

CORRECTION: Dec. 4, 2017
A previous version of this story incorrectly implied that Prof. Thomas had compared Dylan specifically to Sappho. Prof. Thomas has, in fact, compared Dylan to classical authors, but the Sappho comparison is the writer's. Other editing errors have been amended as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Jeff Sessions’s Senate seat, was accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old, dating teenage girls, and being banned from his local mall, Democrats loudly decried Moore’s egregious behavior. They asserted that sexual harassment and assault was unconscionable, intolerable behavior unbecoming of any U.S. Senator.
When Senator Al Franken was accused of sexual predation, Republican senators and President Donald Trump, who has himself professed a propensity for groping women without their consent, in turn jumped to lambast the Minnesota senator. And while many Democrats called for an ethics investigation into Franken’s behavior, they did not all call on him to resign. When a member of their own party was accused, Democrats in Congress wavered, protecting the perpetrator instead of the victim. Suddenly, sexual predation became an inappropriate mistake.
I was a strong supporter of Franken and believe, politically, his views map onto mine perfectly. I support his commitment to equality, civil rights, affordable health care for all Americans, and supporting the middle class, among other key Democratic principles that I endorse unwaveringly.
On the other hand, I believe Roy Moore’s vision for the country is fundamentally abhorrent. Moore is a candidate who has built his career attacking the constitutional rights of Americans by attacking gay marriage, restricting the agency of women over their own bodies, and claiming a U.S. Congressman could not serve because of his religion.
But their politics—and my beliefs about their politics—are irrelevant when it comes to evaluating their personal behavior. Sexual assault is not a partisan issue. Sexual assault affects everyone—men, women, and children—in society. We are all vulnerable to it. Yet too many defend it for partisan political gain.
On a recent episode of the liberal news podcast “Pod Save America,” one pundit called upon listeners to “say what it takes to heal a culture.” This is my answer.
We need to make women feel comfortable coming forward with allegations of assault. We need women to know that their complaints will be heard and believed, and that justice will be served. We need men to stop assaulting women.
We need people to stop believing that these goals are impossible to achieve. And to do this, we need to demonstrate that there are repercussions to sexual violence and intimidation, whether it manifests itself as assault or workplace harassment, or anywhere on the sickening spectrum in between.
Al Franken has unapologetically joked about rape, touched a woman’s breasts without her consent, and allegedly groped three other women during photo ops. Men, women, and children should know that Al Franken’s behavior renders him unworthy of the honor of serving as a U.S. Senator. His “shame” is not enough—and his apology was shameful.
Any Democrat who excuses Franken’s lascivious behavior—whether it be out of cynicism for our political future or another reason—must recognize that they, too, are part of the problem. By refusing to call upon Franken to resign, we are telling perpetrators of sexual assault and harassment that we will idly accept their fake apologies and gross behavior.
Don’t tell me that Franken’s behavior is acceptable because what Roy Moore—or Donald Trump, or any other politician for that matter—did was worse. They should resign too. The fact that they will not should make Democrats even more committed to changing the culture that allows men to perpetuate sexual assault and harassment and stay in power.
If Franken truly respected women or desired repentance, he would have resigned already. And if Democrats truly respect women, they would have called upon him to do so.

At this point in
the semester, when Harvard College students are simultaneously juggling late midterms, final
projects, and the general tumult of the end of the semester, professors can be
fortunate to have students even attend their classes. Nevertheless, the
attention of the industrious students who have made the trek to lecture may
fall victim to another menace: The ubiquitous
presence of laptops with connections to the Internet.
In a perfect world,
technology in the classroom would only enhance the learning process. Indeed,
through a simple Google search, the modern student can access volumes of
knowledge that would be the envy of any ancient scholar. Moreover, technology
empowers students to take notes at a faster rate and bypass illegible
handwriting, enabling them to follow presentations at their own pace on their
personal screens.
We do not, alas, live in
such a utopia in which technology plays a role exclusively supportive of
education. The frank reality is that laptops prove to be a distraction in
lecture for most Harvard students. Any idle observer of Harvard students’
laptop screens would notice that they are browsing websites that are all but
tangential to the lecture, ranging from Facebook feeds to untended e-mails.
The scientific evidence
about laptop usage in class is ample and not exactly shocking. When students’ attention is diverted from a lecture
they are attending, it is likely at the expense of their comprehension of the
material. Moreover, the consequences are not individual: Students are likely to
be distracted by their peers’ luminescent screens, so that their attention and
learning will suffer too. Lastly, it is unfortunate for Harvard professors and
lecturers to have to compete against students’ laptop screens for attention.
Nevertheless, we do not believe that professors should take
drastic steps such as forbidding laptops in their classroom. For one, this
would greatly disadvantage students with disabilities who need technology to
take notes. Moreover, such a paternalistic approach deprives students of the
opportunity to learn from their mistakes and to experiment with distinct
approaches to how they learn; after all, there will be no guardrails in place
to prevent Harvard students from making other unwise decisions once they
graduate. With a blanket policy, professors may improve students’ learning, but
they will deny them the opportunity to develop character.
That said, professors should not allow laptops to run rampant in the classroom.
For one, it is unfair for students who intend to follow the lecture without a
laptop to have to resist the distraction presented by other students, and professors
are also entitled to have minimum expectations of engagement from students. For
these reasons, we encourage moderate policies such as designated electronics
areas in the back of lecture halls where students will not distract their
peers.
Lastly, we do believe
that students have an important role in self-monitoring and prioritizing
lectures over whatever website may pique their interest. If students took a
second to wean themselves from their engrossment in their laptop screens, they
may just notice that their professor has something interesting to say.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, I drafted a unpublished column about how to deal with Trump supporters in your life.  It was pithy
and deflective, written weeks before election night. I mostly wrote about
handling friends’ and family members’ pro-Trump posts on Facebook, which often tended
to be offensive or factually incorrect. I grappled with whether or not it was
worth it to respond to these Facebook posts, to argue with our grandmothers
about politics. My advice was to ignore it—it wasn’t worth it to engage in
heated political battles with our friends and loved ones. Instead, we should
wait for this period of political insanity to subside, and engage in other
forms of activism to expedite the process.
A year later, political
bedlam is the norm, and it hasn’t become any easier to deal with family and
friends who support President Donald Trump or other contemptible politicians like Roy
Moore. Since the inauguration, Trump has provided an overwhelming
amount of evidence showing that he’s incompetent and dangerous,
and yet many still
stick by him. It seems impossible to convince them of Trump’s incompetence.
This problem is
especially difficult for those of us who have grown up and lived with his
supporters. They are my family members, former classmates, and childhood
friends. These are the people I grew up with and around, who I’ve known to be
generous, kind, and seemingly rational my entire life, and who now have become
almost impossible to view in the same light. It isn’t a case of letting
politics come between relationships, but one of genuinely questioning their
morals and values. Whether motivated by political tribalism or something else,
supporting characters like Trump, who govern recklessly and speak through
insults, is beyond political disagreement.
It becomes even harder
to know how to reach those at home in Nebraska when my college environment is
so different. I still grapple with feeling responsible for defending Nebraskans
and Midwesterners to my peers at Harvard, where a plurality of
students come from the Northeast. How could I, now an outsider in both places I
call home, consider myself qualified to comment on the political state of
either? Now in my second year at the College, I am increasingly removed from
the lives of those whom I spent 17 years with. I prescribe solutions and assign
motives to the best of my ability, considering almost two decades of experience
in the environment, but at the end of the day, sitting in a library in
Massachusetts may not warrant these opinions anymore. Maybe I am too far
removed.
But ignoring Trump and
his supporters would also mean ignoring the mistake that I and many other
Democrats made before the 2016 election. Failing to address this large
demographic of people who support Trump led to the disaster of the political
sphere we live in today. Some of them will back Trump no matter what—around
one in four Americans fail to
“think of anything that Trump could do, or fail to do, in his term as
president” that would result in him losing their support. Whether they are our
family members or friends, I don’t wish to engage in a political tug-of-war
with those who would defend Trump calling Elizabeth
Warren “Pocahontas,” especially while he was supposed to be honoring two
Native American code talkers at the White House.
However, there are
practical measures we can take to deter those more in the middle of the
political spectrum from supporting Trump. These are the people who voted for him because they didn’t feel adequately represented by anyone else,
and because they didn’t feel strongly enough that he was a bad choice. Some of
these voters will likely not vote the same way in 2020 if Trump runs for
reelection—his approval rating has dropped enormously,
even among those who supported him in 2016. Still, the country, as well as the
Democratic Party, must honestly discuss the failures that allowed this
political environment to exist. More civic education in schools and
communities is necessary, and people must recognize that reaching out to those
with different views is the first step in fostering a political environment
that is less antagonistic and more conducive to real, positive change.

Commercial robberies in Cambridge are up over 75 percent in 2017 compared to 2016, according to the most recent crime analysis report from the Cambridge Police Department.
In the October report, CPD recorded 32 total commercial robberies in Cambridge from January through October 2017, while in the same window last year, only 18 such instances were reported. Over the previous five years, the number of reported commercial robberies averaged around 21 for the same time period.
According to their 2016 Annual Crime Report, CPD defines commercial robbery as the forceful taking of valuables from “a commercial or financial establishment.” Bank heists and convenience store hold-ups were the most commonly committed type, Warnick said. Of the 32 reported commercial robberies, 10 were bank heists.
CPD writes in the report that this uptick follows the wider trend of a rise in bank robberies around eastern Massachusetts since Thanksgiving 2016.
“This isn’t isolated to Cambridge. This is a regional issue,” Jeremy Warnick, spokesperson for CPD, said. “There’s been a regional increase in bank robberies and regional increase in convenience store robberies as well.”
Most of the incidents in Cambridge occurred in the first half of the year, according to Warnick. Since July, CPD logged only 8 commercial robberies.
Though the issue of robberies is a citywide concern, Warnick acknowledged that the squares, including Harvard, Central, Kendall, and Porter, are more “vulnerable.”
Most recently in Harvard Square, CPD responded to a bank robbery on Nov. 7 and were able to apprehend the suspect, according to CPD public police logs. In January of this year, two banks on Massachusetts Ave., one in Harvard Square and the other in Central Square, also reported robberies.
According to Warnick, CPD believes that the increase in commercial robberies is caused in part by the opioid epidemic. Warnick said “people that are suffering from addiction looking for quick cash to be able to satisfy their cravings” may be committing the crimes.
Besides addressing the opioid epidemic, CPD has assigned officers as business liaisons, who serve as primary links between business and the police.
“[Liaisons] provide everything from training and security assessments for businesses to just being that ongoing point of contact,” Warnick said.
Warnick added that when the department notices ongoing trends of crime affecting certain areas, they may opt to increase police presence, including deploying plainclothes and undercover officers.
Though this year’s trend may be worrisome for some business owners, others, such as Cheng-San Chen, owner of the local convenience store Louie’s Superette, say the situation has been worse in the past.
“Maybe ten years ago, I had three or four robberies at a time,” Chen said. “[There] used to be almost two acres of empty land across from me, a building where the teenage kids used to hide out, but now Harvard put a new building on the corner almost ten years ago. Now there’s a building, more people walk around, it’s a better neighborhood.”
According to the 2016 Annual Crime Report, ten years ago, in 2007, 41 commercial robberies were reported in Cambridge. Since then, the number of annual reported instances has not crossed over 40.

UPDATED: November 29, 2017 at 1:51 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust made the rounds in Washington earlier this month to argue against a Republican tax plan that would create significant financial burdens for the University and its affiliates.
Both from her office in Cambridge and in-person during her latest trip to the nation’s capital, Faust has spoken to dozens of lawmakers in recent weeks to make her case, including the Massachusetts congressional delegation, University alumni in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer '71.
Those conversations are part of a broader University effort to combat policy prescriptions administrators have said will harm Harvard and higher education throughout the country.
“A number of provisions in the bill have the potential to seriously damage American higher education as well as individuals who live, work, and learn at colleges and universities across the country,” Faust said in an emailed statement. “I am deeply concerned about the ways in which these measures threaten to undermine innovation and discovery, and deter people from pursuing their educational goals.”
Specifically, administrators decried a proposal in both Senate and House versions to levy a 1.4 percent excise tax on university endowments, which would have cost Harvard $43 million last year. Faust also raised concerns about provisions in the House bill that would tax graduate student tuition waivers as income and eliminate student loan deductions. In an email to Harvard affiliates last week, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 explained how the bills might affect them and urged them to contact their representatives.
Garber also wrote that, in addition to Faust, members of Harvard’s governing boards, alumni, and other University affiliates have lobbied lawmakers to reconsider the proposals. The University’s Washington-based federal affairs team has continued its attempts to shift legislation more in Harvard's favor.
Beyond purely higher education-focused issues, in her recent conversations with lawmakers, Faust has also made the case for the University’s position on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—an Obama-era program that protects undocumented youth that Trump announced he would end earlier this year—and funding for scientific research.
The House passed their version of the tax reform bill on Nov. 16 and the Senate Budget Committee passed a different version Tuesday. The full Senate will likely vote on that bill later this week, and if it passes, both chambers will need to reconcile differences between the two plans in order for it to become law.

Whole Heart Provisions and Blackbird Doughnuts are looking to move into the renovated Smith Campus Center when it opens in the fall of 2018.
Vegetarian eatery Whole Heart Provisions and artisanal gourmet doughnut shop Blackbird Doughnuts are both small, Boston-based companies.
If approved by the City, Whole Heart Provisions and Blackbird Doughnuts will join six other tenants in the student center’s ground floor public spaces. Three other food venues have already made their bids on the space: bakery chain Swissbäkers, Vietnamese-inspired sandwich and salad shop Bon Me, and coffee roaster Pavement Coffeehouse.
After conversations with Harvard, both Whole Heart Provisions and Blackbird Doughnuts are set to appear before the Board of Zoning Appeal on Nov. 30 and Dec. 14, respectively.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the selected vendors will be a good fit for Harvard affiliates and Cantabrigians alike.
“The restaurants will offer a wide range of food selections in a casual and comfortable setting, and help us achieve a shared vision for this site—one that will benefit the Harvard community, as well as the entire Harvard Square area for many years to come,” she wrote.
O’Rourke has previously said the University sought out food venues that are locally-based, diverse in offerings, and that provide healthy, sustainable, and affordable options.
Rebecca Arnold, co-founder of Whole Heart Provisions, said the company has been considering the space since Harvard approached them early this year.
“I think it’ll just be a great atmosphere for us with all the students coming through and tourists,” Arnold said. “Our entire menu is plant-based and we’ll be the only ones in the Square that are a hundred percent plant-based,” she added.
According to their zoning application, Whole Heart Provisions will offer plant-based veggie and grain bowls, breakfast options, and snacks such as seared avocado, street corn, and falafel dogs. Whole Heart Provisions would be located in the central arcade area on the Dunster St. side of the building.
While Blackbird Doughnuts’ owner Rebecca Roth Gullo declined to comment, the company's zoning plans indicate that the shop will be located inside the common space pavilion facing  theHolyoke St. side of the building. The shop would sell homemade cake and yeast-based doughnuts, in addition to coffee and ice cream.
The University recently filed an application to extend construction hours between 6 p.m. and midnight in order to meet its fall 2018 opening date for the Smith Campus Center. The application will be discussed at the Nov. 29 License Commission public meeting.

Former Fox News anchor Gretchen E. Carlson spoke about her new book, "Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back," at a Tuesday afternoon seminar hosted by the student-run group Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business.
Carlson, who left Fox News in June 2016, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against former Fox News CEO Roger E. Ailes in July of the same year. This action, which she described as “probably the biggest decision of my life,” sparked an international conversation about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and gender-based inequalities in the workplace.
Carlson said Tuesday that the idea for "Be Fierce" arose after she received thousands of letters from women across industries in the weeks after her lawsuit became public.
“I started printing off all these stories in my home office, and I was like, ‘Gosh, I better do something with all of these stories,’” Carlson said. “The one thing they all said to me was, ‘Nobody ever heard my voice.’ And they felt that because my case was so public, that I had become their voice, and I felt this sense of duty to honor them in writing the book of their stories.”
During her talk, Carlson emphasized the importance of talking about sexual harassment on college campuses as a means of preventing such behavior in the workplace.
“Sexual assault is a huge thing on college campuses and is very akin to harassment in the sense that women don’t feel safe coming forward,” she said. “My main piece of advice is just to really open up the dialogue about all of these issues and not try to shove it away and pretend like it’s not going on.”
Emily R. Johnson ’18-’19, who attended the event, said she appreciated Carlson’s forthrightness.
“It’s just impressive to me, just the timeliness of it all, and it definitely helps to hear from someone who is really open about it,” Johnson said.
Charlotte Kim ’20, one of the leaders of Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business, said the decision to invite Carlson to campus was meant to reinforce the group’s mission of “empowering young women through business education and experience.”
“We’re trying to create a space for women to feel empowered in the workplace,” Kim said. “We thought that [Carlson’s] message really aligned with our goals because it’s all about equality in the workforce.”
“She has been a huge advocate for women’s rights, she has been a pioneer, so we thought it definitely made sense to bring her in,” she added.

Two more Harvard seniors will continue their studies abroad at Oxford as international Rhodes Scholars, bringing the total number of Harvard-affiliated winners to seven.
The Zimbabwe Rhodes Selection Committee and the Caribbean Commonwealth Rhodes Selection Committee named current seniors Terrens Muradzikwa ’18 and Mandela Patrick ’18 winners of the scholarships in their respective regions.
More than 350 Harvard alumni have received the honor since the Rhodes Scholarship, which pays for graduate study at Oxford, was established in 1902.
Patrick applied to the Rhodes Scholarship through the Caribbean Commonwealth Rhodes scholarship. A Computer Science concentrator in Currier House hailing from San Fernando, Trinidad, Patrick said he felt “a mix of relief and excitement” upon hearing the news. He plans to pursue a master’s degree in Statistical Science and a master’s degree in Computer Science, both with focuses on machine learning.
Patrick said that he has been considering applying for the Rhodes for a long time.
“It was something I was considering but I wasn't sure whether I wanted to go straight into graduate school right after undergrad. But I felt like this was probably my best chance to get extremely technical,” he said.
Patrick plays on the men’s varsity squash team and is involved in the Digital Literacy Project, the Caribbean Club, and SummerCamp.io, an organization that facilitates networking among summer technology interns.
Muradzikwa, an Economics concentrator in Dunster House from Mutare, applied for the scholarship through his home country of Zimbabwe. Chosen from a pool of 10 finalists in Zimbabwe, Muradzikwa was the sole Zimbabwean to receive the Rhodes this year.
“It’s truly a blessing, a feat I would have never achieved on my own. Very overwhelmed by winning the Rhodes Scholarship and very grateful to professors who recommended me, House tutors who gave me mock interviews and advice, and friends and family who prayed for and encouraged me,” Muradzikwa said.
At Oxford, Muradzikwa plans to pursue a one-year Master of Science in economics for development and a one-year Master of Public Policy, focusing on “how innovative technologies can be used to spur economic growth in developing countries in both private and public sectors,” he said.
In addition to being involved in the Harvard Africa Business and Investment Club, Muradzikwa also works on two digital start-ups: the African Exponent, a multimedia news platform that aims to open discussion on developments in Africa, and the Shasha Network, a digital education company.
Patrick and Muradzikwa will join Tania N. Fabo ’18, H. Xavier Gonzalez ’18,                        Samarth Gupta ’18, and Alan Z. Yang ’18, the Harvard seniors who were announced as the winners of the American Rhodes Scholarship earlier this month. A recent graduate, Jamie J. Beaton ’16, was also named a New Zealand Rhodes Scholar.

Six Harvard football players earned All-Ivy recognition last week, with juniors Charlie Booker III and Justice Shelton-Mosley landing on the first team as a running back and return specialist, respectively.
Three seniors made the All-Ivy second team. Safety Tanner Lee, linebacker Luke Hutton, and defensive tackle Stone Hart grabbed the honor after anchoring a defense that held opponents to 20.9 points per game.
Junior defensive tackle Richie Ryan rounded out the defensive prizes with an All-Ivy honorable mention. And Shelton-Mosley nabbed an honorable mention at wide receiver, too.
At the end of each season, all Ancient Eight coaches vote on the All-Ivy honors. The first and second teams each hold around 27 players—12 on offense, 12 on defense, and three on special teams. Coaches select another three dozen athletes as honorable mentions.
Last week, the Crimson also awarded internal prizes at an end-of-season banquet. Teammates named Lee as the Most Valuable Player. The safety also earned the Henry H. Lamar Award for dedication to the program. Previously, no Harvard player had claimed both prizes in the same season.
Last season, Lee gained an honorable mention after leading the Crimson with four interceptions. In 2017, he started all 10 games at safety and logged 55 tackles.
“There was so much to play for this year,” Lee said. “I’ve grown a lot.”
Several other defensive players earned team-wide recognition. Senior defensive tackle Tristan Tahmaseb won the Joseph E. Wolf Award as the top interior lineman, Hutton won the Robert F. Kennedy Award for desire and determination, and senior cornerback Raishaun McGhee won the William Paine LaCroix Trophy for enthusiasm, sportsmanship, and loyalty.
Senior tight end Jake Barann was the sole prize winner on offense. He received the Joseph Restic Award for leadership, scholarship, and integrity.
The defensive imbalance of awards reflected the youth of the offense. In 2017, many of the team leaders played on the defense. Meanwhile, most high-impact offensive players—including the top wide receiver, rusher, and passer—will return for 2018.
“On offense, we’re returning a bunch of guys,” Lee said. “[Quarterback Jake Smith] will be better after another year of playing against our defense.”
The awards offered some consolation after a trying season. Bedeviled by injuries, the Crimson stumbled to a 5-5 record and a fifth-place finish in the conference. Meanwhile, Yale rebounded from a 3-7 campaign in 2016 to top the Ancient Eight. Columbia and Dartmouth followed in second.
The All-Ivy honors bore out this hierarchy, as the Bulldogs led all programs with eight first-team selections. Freshman running back Zane Dudek made headlines as the unanimous Rookie of the Year. Prior to 2017, no freshman had ever led the Ancient Eight in rushing or earned a unanimous spot on the All-Ivy first team. Dudek, who totaled 1,133 yards on 7.1 yards per carry, achieved both feats. He slotted second in the FCS with 15 rushing touchdowns.
For Columbia, coach Al Bagnoli stole the show. He received Coach of the Year after marshaling his team to an 8-2 record. He came out of retirement to lead the bumbling Lions to a 2-8 finish, and then a 3-7 finish, before this year’s breakout.
Penn placed second, with five first-team nods. Senior wide receiver Justin Watson recieved his third-straight unanimous selection to the first team.
In total, nine players earned a unanimous pick. Watson, Dudek, Princeton quarterback Chad Kanoff, and favorite target Jesper Horsted made the offense. Meanwhile, defensive end Richard Jarvis (Brown), linebacker Matthew Oplinger (Yale), linebacker Jack Traynor (Dartmouth), and safety Nick Gesualdi (Cornell) highlighted the other side of the ball.
The Ivy League still must name two major awards—the Offensive and Defensive Players of the Year. Last year, Princeton quarterback John Lovett and Big Green linebacker Folarin Orimolade won the honors.
Almost certainly, no Harvard player will win either award in 2017. The Crimson didn’t have a historic performer this season, although Booker and Shelton-Mosley provided highlights. The seven All-Ivy awards marked the lowest Harvard total since 1998, when the Crimson finished below .500 for the last time.
Ancient Eight coaches especially shunned the Harvard offensive line, which had sported at least one All-Ivy player in each of the last 22 seasons. No offensive lineman achieved that honor this season.
2017 wasn’t a year of major decorations. Rather, players will remember the season as one of tribulations. Effort despite adversity—this is the legacy that Lee, Hutton, and the rest of the seniors have left.
“We couldn’t have asked for better leaders,” said senior safety and incoming captain Zach Miller. “They went after it every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The value of a basketball player is often quantified through stats, metrics that evaluate in-game performance. However, as sophomore Justin Bassey has demonstrated throughout his basketball career, valuable contributions can come not only on the court, but also off it.
Before coming to Harvard and emerging as the men’s basketball’s top perimeter defender as a freshman, Bassey immersed himself in a variety of service work at his high school, leaving a legacy through surface projects in his hometown, and gaining a lot in the process.
The Denver, Colo., native went to high school at Colorado Academy, a prestigious private school in nearby Lakewood.
In  his time there, Bassey was a four-year letterwinner and captained the team during his junior and senior seasons. He finished his career as Colorado Academy’s all-time scoring leader—accumulating 2,159 points—and he was twice named to Colorado’s all-state team.
Bassey said that his initial exposure to the sentiment of service work developed when his high school coach asked his players to help out at a Unified basketball tournament, a tournament affiliated with the Special Olympics for those with disabilities.
“That was something that was super cool growing up, being able to ref and run the scoreboard and understanding how to set it up, what students are going to need who are going to participate in it, what kind of accommodations we would have to make, like reserving gym time,” Bassey said.
“Doing that from an early age always kind of emphasized the relationship between basketball and community building.”
The connective power of sports was also made evident to Bassey when he competed on a travel basketball team with players that came from families with a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds.
He noted how this experience put his place of privilege into perspective after he saw this disparity in opportunity.
“It’s crazy despite us coming from what couldn’t be more different backgrounds, here’s something that ties us together through playing basketball,” Bassey said.
“After seeing that, I really wanted to find a way. Is there something that can bridge the gap between our two lifestyles but also do so in a meaningful way that will actually make an impact?”
For his high school coach Steve Hyatt, Bassey was an extremely vocal player with an impressive basketball IQ.
Moreover, the budding basketball star had an “impeccable” work ethic and was “not afraid to put the time and energy into something he loves, into his passion.”
“He always keeps everything in a positive manner,” Hyatt said. “He’s a happy go-lucky. He likes to joke around, he likes to have fun, that kind of thing. He’s not an introvert. He’s a bright kid, but he’s not an introvert. He’s very outgoing. He’s very talkative, and I think he adds a lot to practice, to the team just because of who he is, his personality.”
Before coming to Colorado Academy, Hyatt taught special education at nearby Bear Creek High School and coached basketball for 28 years. He said at the Unified basketball games, Bassey would take the initiative and fully immerse himself in the logistics of the event.
“He doesn’t sit there and [wait to be told to do something],” Hyatt said. “He just sits down and says, ‘I’ll do the clock.’ I don’t even need to ask him, he just does it. Then there’s a microphone there, and he’ll be like, ‘I’ll do the announcing.’ That’s just who he is.”
Bassey’s assertiveness is part of his larger affinity to finishing the job.
For Hyatt, Bassey’s initiative started at an even younger age when Bassey was good friends with Hyatt’s son, Christian. Coach Hyatt said that Bassey’s loyalty is one of his strongest personality traits.
“I remember he wanted to do something with my son, and my son was like ‘No, I have to help my dad paint,’” Hyatt said. “An hour later, he shows up. I go, ‘What are you doing here?’ he goes, ‘I’m here to help you paint.’ He was like nine or 10, so I gave him a paint brush and I gave my son a paint brush. I said, ‘You guys paint the shed.’ They got 90 percent more paint on them than on the shed, but that’s the type of kid he is. There’s a need, he’ll show up and do it.”
For his senior project at Colorado Academy, Bassey set up a charity basketball tournament that pitted the different extracurricular clubs at the high school against each other to vie for a donation to a charity of their choosing.
“I have always seen sports as something that’s been at the forefront of society in terms of progressiveness,” Bassey said.
“I think my parents really instilled that sports are more than a means of making friends. My dad always told me there’s something about sports that brings people together in a fashion that’s not seen in a lot of places.”
Bassey also worked with Project Greer Street, an academic enrichment program for African-American males at East High School, an inner-city high school in Denver.
According to Project Greer Street founder Ron Sally, the program aims to propel students from East High to compete academically at the top colleges and universities across the country.
“One of the things that we [my wife and I] were convinced of is that we wanted to be able to share with the students and their families a lot of the great lessons that we had learned and wisdom that we had acquired over the years as it relates to having success in high school academically,” Sally said.
Sally said that he has tried to give his student “domestic intel” by bringing in a variety of speakers. These speakers have given  tutorials on everything from about taking advantage of academic resources to interacting with the police.
Ultimately, the program strives to elevate students’ expectations and ambitions, while giving them tools to succeed in the outside world.
“It’s all part of our view of it as very holistic,” Sally said. “It takes a village to raise a successful person, and we’re honored to be part of the village of the kids that we work with.”
Sally met Bassey when his nephew played on the same club basketball team as the now-college sophomore. From the start, Sally recognized Bassey’s strong character.
“He was polished as far as presenting himself. Even before he got to high school, he was articulate,” Sally said. “He clearly had an active mind and thinking, you could tell that when you were conversing with him. And he was very ambitious, and I’ve known that ever since. That’s continued, and he’s continued to evolve in all of those characteristics and has become even more impressive as he’s continued along his journey.”
Sally brought in Bassey as a speaker after Bassey got admitted to Harvard. Like Hyatt, Sally recognized Bassey’s unbridled enthusiasm to help out. Sally said that college-bound student-athlete brought “impressive and authentic” wisdom.
“The kids were able to see somebody that they looked at and said, ‘He’s only one or two years beyond where I am,’” Sally said.
“He’s also local, which was helpful. He wasn’t coming in from New York City or something, but here’s someone from Colorado.”
Bassey said by interacting with students at Project Greer Street, he was able to expose them to opportunities beyond athletics and introduce a more complete life path.
Bassey also spent a summer interning with Sally at Project Greer Street to gather information about enriching summer programming and sharing that information with some of the program’s participants.
He encouraged one student to apply to a computer programming program at Stanford.
“A lot of the students, at least [that] I talked with and that I interacted with through Project Greer Street were people who saw sports as their only means of escape, their only means to get away from their parent/family situation, their only means to get to college, their only means to pay for an opportunity outside their local neighborhood,” Bassey said.
“As a result, those kids were, not narrow minded, but they had a very narrow scope, and they didn’t really know of the opportunities that existed outside of sports and athletics.”
Bassey said that he strove to break stereotypes and to serve as a role model for the students in Project Greer Street. This means widening their views of the world, conversation by conversation.
“I think it’s humbling,” Bassey said. “I’ve had such amazing people in my life who’ve almost fallen into my lap. I just happen to know them, to run into them and build a relationship there. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. To be on the flip side of things and be the person who shows up out of nowhere and is like, ‘hey, let me help me, let me be a resource for you to use, and a tool,’ is humbling.”
Conversely, Sally noted the great influence Bassey has had on his students.
“He is very down to earth, very grounded, and personifies class across the board,” Sally said. “So, I would say that’s what stood out.”
Throughout his experiences, from volunteering at the Unified basketball tournament to setting up his own charity basketball tournament to working at Project Greer Street, Bassey’s service work has imparted him with a sense of appreciation for his family, for his school, and for the opportunities given to him.
This compassion is something that Bassey continues to hold on to, even now at Harvard as he participates in a competitive Division 1 collegiate basketball program.
“I think it’s made me a better person overall,” Bassey said.
“I doubt that they’ve understood the influence they’ve had on me, and I think it gets skewed a lot that the person who’s reaching out or giving the talk has all the knowledge to impart and doesn’t gain anything back, and I think I’ve probably got more out of them than possibly I’ve helped them with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s hockey team, November has been ugly. To start the 1-5-1 month, the squad fell to Ivy League rival Yale. Shortly thereafter, the Crimson hit the road for a record nine-game stretch featuring competitive tilts, both in- and out-of-conference.
Along this journey, Harvard (2-5-1, 2-3-0 ECAC) suffered overtime defeats to Cornell and Minnesota in raucous barns and put forth a disappointing offensive effort against a lockdown Colgate team.
“We believe we could’ve performed better stats- and standings-wise,” junior forward Ryan Donato said, reflecting on the previous few weeks. “One of the best games we’ve played all year was against Cornell…. Obviously it wasn’t the way we wanted to end it, but that just left us with the feeling that this is how we know we can play. We know we can play with top teams.”
Emerging from the rubble is a humbled group of Crimson icemen with lines vastly different from opening night in late October—coach Ted Donato ’91 and his staff were far from pleased with the team’s results and needed to shake things up.
“The coaches were done with losing games,” Donato said. “Obviously, it’s a bitter feeling knowing that what you thought were your top lines didn’t perform. Now that we kind of jumbled the lines up a little bit and found a gel with these guys that we’re playing with, hopefully we’ll find success.”
Now, however, things are trending up—or at the very least, they aren’t trending down. Harvard’s offense, which entered last Friday’s matchup at Boston College among the NCAA’s bottom 10 teams in goals per game (2.29), experienced a breakthrough that afternoon. A 4-4 tie with the Eagles, while technically not a standings win, was in many ways still a victory, as an end to the turbulent month of November is in sight for the Crimson squad.
New line pairings, especially up front, are starting to click, and freshmen are rising to the challenge of extra ice time. Rookies Henry Bowlby and Jack Badini, in particular, are relishing their new roles. Bowlby has three points in four games since coach Donato bumped him up to the top forward trio, while Badini picked up his first career multi-point performance (1 goal, 2 assists) in his first game centering the second line.
“It definitely helps playing with [Ryan Donato] and Lewis [Zerter-Gossage],” a modest Bowlby said. “They’re great linemates, and I’m definitely, as a young player, trying to take notes from them.”
For Harvard, the road to a winning record ideally begins this weekend. The Crimson embarks on its least busy month of the schedule—just four games are slotted for December—with a pair of ECAC contests featuring Quinnipiac on Friday and Princeton the following night.
“I think this weekend with Quinnipiac and Princeton is a huge weekend for us to kind of end [the semester] on a good note,” Donato said. “I think our team’s really pulling together now and I think we’re really going to start hitting our full potential coming after that first semester.”
The weekend back-to-back marks the first time in four weeks that Harvard will not play a currently ranked opponent. Nevertheless, the Crimson’s lackluster record to this point has raised the stakes for all 21 remaining regular season games on the schedule.
“Every night is a night that you have to get up for, no matter who you’re playing,” said Donato. “Especially now with our record, every little game is going to matter, and I think that just being consistent is the big message.”
Like coach Donato’s squad, Friday’s foe is similarly discontent with its current record. The Bobcats (6-7-1, 3-4-0) opened the 2017-2018 campaign at 3-1-1 after a pair of victories over now-No. 12 Northeastern. Also like Harvard, however, Quinnipiac went on to suffer a four-game losing streak that started with a winless weekend against Cornell and Colgate.
Recent clashes between the Crimson and the Bobcats have consistently been hard-fought. Harvard has nabbed the previous two bouts, but Quinnipiac took four straight before that, including an overtime thriller at Madison Square Garden in January 2016, when the Bobcats were ranked No. 2/1.
“In [Quinnipiac’s] barn, it’s always a close game,” Donato said. “They’re always going to finish every check. They play really hard…. We just have to get pucks deep and play a style where we run them down. We have a great conditioned team.”
Having played into the offensive approach of its last few adversaries, the Crimson will have to adjust to Quinnipiac’s physical, trapping brand of hockey.
“We know Quinnipiac plays a trap in the neutral zone and they like to transition the puck really fast,” Bowlby said. “We’re going to have to…work them in the offensive zone and make them play defense.”
Heading into the season, Harvard accounted for half of the all-ECAC team, as sophomore defensemen Adam Fox, tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen, and Donato all earned spots. The Bobcats were also represented on this shortlist of players to watch, as junior blue-liner Chase Priskie intrigued both media and coaches ahead of the new campaign.
Priskie (5 goals, 5 assists) headlines the Quinnipiac roster along with the team’s scoring leader, first-year forward Odeen Tufto (3 goals, 12 assists), and sophomore netminder Andrew Shortridge (5-5-1, 1.89 GAA, .924 SV%).
In Saturday’s tilt with the Tigers (4-5-1, 2-4-1), the Crimson will face yet another pre-season all-ECAC selection in junior forward Max Véronneau. The Ottawa, Ont., native has already notched six goals and six assists through Princeton’s 10 games this year, as he continues to ride the momentum from last season’s point-per-game performance.
In addition to Véronneau, three fellow upperclassmen help round out the offensive leadership for the Tigers, who improved 10 games year-over-year last season: junior Ryan Kuffner and seniors David Hallisey and Eric Robinson have registered 13 goals and 13 assists through 30 combined games.
Now that Harvard’s offense seems to be clicking thanks to coach Donato’s new line combinations, the Crimson will look to capitalize on rookie goaltender Ryan Ferland. Princeton’s first-year netminder has not shined through the first third of the season, posting a 4-4-1 record on a 3.07 goals against average and .911 save percentage.
Historically, matchups between the Harvard icemen and the Tigers have been lopsided, with the Crimson owning a 155-58-11 overall record. Of late, this trend has only been magnified: Harvard seeks its ninth straight win over Princeton on Saturday as it looks to start clawing back to .500 in this young season.
“At the end of the day, we left ourselves a chance to come back with a strong second half,” Donato said. “We really have to push ourselves after [the holiday] break to show the kind of potential that we have as a team.”
