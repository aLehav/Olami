After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y.—Despite shooting at just 23 percent in the second half, the Harvard women’s basketball team held on for a scrappy victory over Tulsa, 61-57, in the first round of the Fordham Holiday Classic on Sunday at Rose Hill Gym. The tilt was the second to last outing before the Crimson starts its Ivy League season.
“We are just lucky that we are walking out with a W,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “There was not one good aspect of the game; however, when they needed to get some defensive stops and some big rebounds, they did, and that’s why we are walking away with the W.”
With just over two minutes to play and a tenuous two-point lead, a steal by Golden Hurricane point guard Kelsee Grovey could have been a death sentence for the Crimson (9-3), but Tulsa (4-5) could not pull off the comeback.
Aggressive physical play landed the Golden Hurricane in foul trouble late in the game with 13 infractions in the second half. The double bonus proved friendly to Harvard as guards Christine Clark and Ali Curtis each knocked down one from the line in the final 16 seconds to ensure a Crimson win.
Things weren’t always so down to the wire for Harvard, who led by as many as nine points during both halves. While the first frame saw the Crimson shoot at an efficient 54 percent, field goals didn’t come as easily during the second 20 minutes.
“We got a lot of really easy buckets that didn’t fall, and then it becomes contagious,” Delaney-Smith said. “What we should be better at and are better at is sort of leaving the misses behind us and then picking everybody up and making them believe the next one’s going to fall. We didn’t connect with each other today on the floor.”
Integral to the shots that did fall was senior guard Jasmine Evans. Evans led the team with a career-high 17 points, and chipped in two steals and six rebounds. With Tulsa struggling to defend the perimeter, Evans capitalized on the open lane and drilled three of four attempts from behind the arc.
“It was definitely teammates finding the open player,” Evans said. “We always want to push the ball in transition and find the open player. They just kept finding me, and I just happened to be open. They did a good job of assisting that.”
Evans, who has battled injuries that threatened to end her basketball career, spent much of last season playing in a defensive capacity, but she has transitioned to powering the Crimson’s offense this fall.
“We have individual meetings with the coaches every year,” Evans said. “They were telling me that as a senior [that I should] be there for the team not just defensively but offensively, and try to keep the poise and be a leader out there on the floor…. They have a lot of confidence in me, and that definitely helps my game.”
Trailing Evans in the points column were junior forwards Erin McDonnell and Temi Fagbenle, who had 11 and 10 points, respectively. McDonnell established a versatile post presence in the first half, while Fagbenle was reliable on the interior throughout the game. Fagbenle also provided power on the glass, with 14 rebounds to round out her fourth straight double-double.
The Crimson will return to Rose Hill for the Holiday Classic championship game on Monday to face tournament-host Fordham, who routed UNC Greensboro, 79-48, in Sunday's first semifinal. Led by redshirt senior point guard Erin Rooney, the Rams are riding a nine-game win streak and are poised to challenge the Harvard squad.
“Fordham is a really well-coached, similar team to us in many regards with probably one of the best points guards I’ve seen in a long time,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’ve got our work cut out for us tomorrow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team wasted no time shaking off the exam-period and holiday rust, jumping right out of the gate with five first period goals to come away with a 9-3 victory over the Russian Red Stars in a Sunday night exhibition game at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
In the visitors' third match of six in their annual North American tour, the Crimson put up a strong showing against the Red Stars, an all-star team of 17 to 21-year-old players from the  MHL, a 64-club junior hockey league encompassing nine eastern European countries.
The game settled down a bit after the first period, but Harvard (4-7-2, 2-6-2 ECAC) maintained its offensive onslaught with two more goals in the second and two more in the third. The Red Stars fought back with the first goal of the second period and two more in the final frame, but it was not enough to match the Crimson’s highest-scoring game of 2013.
“I think for us coming out of the break it’s a nice opportunity to get a game in and to get some guys some game situations,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We scored some goals, which makes the coach happy and more importantly it makes the players happy, and I think some guys who might have been squeezing their sticks otherwise felt good to get on the scoreboard tonight.”
Sophomore Jimmy Vesey led the way for the Crimson, recording a hat trick and an assist. Freshman Alexander Kerfoot had four points on the game as well, with one goal and three assists. Twelve Harvard skaters recorded at least one point during the game.
“It was good to come off break,” Vesey said. “We struggled a bit in the first half scoring goals so it’s good to put up nine to get our confidence going, and hopefully it carries into Saturday [against BU]."
Senior Raphael Girard and sophomore Peter Traber split the time in net, recording 18 and 12 saves, respectively.
After Kerfoot opened the scoring with a goal at 6:54 with help from junior Patrick McNally, Harvard netted four goals in the span of less than three minutes.
Vesey immediately took advantage of a power-play opportunity with a one-time shot from the left crease after a soft pass from sophomore Kyle Criscuolo to make it 2-0. Senior David Valek scored 13 seconds later, tapping in a pass from streaking junior Tommy O’Regan.
After the Red Stars replaced goaltender Vascheslav Volkov with Artur Khaniarova following the Crimson's third goal, Harvard continued to pile onto its lead with two goals within 77 seconds of each other.
Freshman Phil Zielonka put a shot through the legs of Khaniarova near the left post after a cross-ice pass from Criscuolo off a Harvard faceoff win in the left circle. Freshman Luke Esposito capped off the first-period scoring for the Crimson with an elevated backhand shot over the sprawled Red Star goalie following a deflection off sophomore Brian Hart’s leg.
“[The Red Stars] are used to playing in a big rink. They play on an Olympic size rink [in Europe], so they tend to rely on skill and stick-handling,” Vesey said. “We play on a smaller rink and with a more physical style, and I think that caught them off guard a bit.”
The Red Stars began the second period looking to mount a comeback and adjust to Harvard’s style of play, as Alexei Shamin netted a power-play goal just under two minutes into the frame.
But the Crimson responded later in the period with another quick burst, scoring two goals in 29 seconds. Freshman Sean Malone capitalized on strong passing by Hart and freshman Clay Anderson during a Crimson man-advantage, and junior Ryan McGregor put back a rebound off a McNally slap-shot to make it 7-1 with six minutes left in the second.
In the final frame, Vesey potted his second goal of the night 49 seconds into the period with help from Hart and Malone. The sophomore completed the hat trick less than eight game minutes later on the power play. Alexandr Timirev and Alexander Kuvaev scored for the Red Stars.
Harvard, which entered the game ranked tenth-worst on the power play among Division I teams with a 13.5% success rate, finished the night 5-for-6 performance on the man-advantage.
“It’s nice to build some confidence on special teams, on the power play,” Donato said. “That’s an area we continue to work on and we need to continue to improve upon to have success in the rest of the season.”

To high school seniors applying to college: You are so, so close. Every time you stayed up until an absurd hour perfecting a project, all the focus you’ve devoted to each activity you are a part of, every bit of energy you have put into the past four years of high school--all these sacrifices are about to pay off. They have shaped you as the person you should be proud to be presenting to your admissions officers as you hit submit on your Common App.
As you polish up your applications, remember to congratulate yourself for many things. Some of you have already put so much thought and time into these materials, and they are ready to go. For others, it may be that you’ve only recently come up with new ideas and are still writing up or editing pieces. This is also perfectly fine: these ideas came to you for a reason. They matter to you, so you are more than qualified to write about them well.
Be proud of who you are and how much you’ve grown in these four years of high school. These last days of applying may feel tiring, but think back to two days ago, and how quickly that went by. Repeat the same time frame over again, and you’ll have finished the college application process! Think back to all those final stretches you’ve pushed and succeeded through during the last four years of high school: studying for exams, doing final projects, preparing for a big tournament. You have made it through all of them, so you will do amazingly when completing the final stretch that is these next two days.
Like Dory says in Finding Nemo, “Just keep swimming”. Your college application is a window into the amazing person, student, singer, athlete, debater, juggler, or artist you have become. Most importantly, it’s a celebration of you, a person you should be so, so proud of. So push through the final stretch and give yourself a big hug when you submit that application in two days. You’ve got this, and you’ll do wonderfully.
As people prepare to ring in the New Year, many high school students of the Class of 2014 have a much different agenda in mind. The deadline for a majority of college applications is only a few days away. So, in these final days before hitting the dreadful and inevitable submit button, here are some tips on how to manage the work before the calendar change.
The Common Application
While most students have completed a majority of the common application, the personal statement may still be lingering. A good approach to writing this portion of the application is to think of a story or important part of you that is not fully represented in your application. For example, if you struggled in a course throughout your educational career but met with the teachers constantly, this is a good chance to inform the admissions officers of your persistent and hard work in that subject. Or maybe you attend a lecture or took a pre-college course outside of school that has motivated you academically that you could expound on.
Supplements
When approaching a supplement, refer to information you learned while visiting the school (and if you didn’t visit, a quick browse of the school’s website should suffice). Try to make each supplement as personal and focused as possible for each school, to show your genuine interest in attending. If a school has a special language program or study abroad, try discussing how you would take advantage of that opportunity, using precedent from your prior endeavors.
Make A List
One of the most useful tactics when tackling the application process is to make a list with deadlines of everything that needs to be accomplished. While it may seem like there is a lot of work at the start, this will help keep you organized throughout the process. As you finish and send the Common Application, supplements, and schedule interviews, cross each item off.
One at a time
If you tackle one application at a time, you will find that you can be much more productive. Set a goal for yourself, saying that you will finish your application for College X by a certain time of the day. Once you have knocked out the Common Application, then you will begin to see patterns as you continue from school to school. While that first application may be difficult, you will find it easier as you continue down your list.
Breathe
Applying to college is stressful. There is no one who will tell you that they found this process relaxing, so don’t panic if you feel overwhelmed. Every year, hundreds of thousands of students go through the same process, writing applications and worrying about their immediate future. The most important part is to not get overwhelmed, stay focused, and remember that you’re almost there!
