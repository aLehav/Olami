“The concept of a choir is so poignant,” Taylor E. Weary ’16, manager of Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, says. The Collegium hopes to showcase the ability of choirs to bring people together with their upcoming concert, Boundless Realms of Joy, which will take place on April 11 in Sanders Theatre. Featuring the combined forces of the Collegium, the Brattle Street Chamber Players, renowned conductor Alice Parker, and Joyful Noise (a chorus of adults with neurological and physical challenges), Boundless Realms of Joy also includes an all-day symposium on the intersection of music and neuroscience on April 12.
 
Boundless Realms of Joy’s program will feature a combination of large orchestral-choral works, lighter songs, and a piece composed by Collegium member Gus Ruchman ’15. “It’s exciting to be doing something together that’s original,” Ruchman says. Based on a poem by Sara Pyszka, an author with cerebral palsy, the lyrics of Ruchman’s piece convey an empowering message about everyone’s significance. “No one is reducible to just how they look, talk, or act,” Ruchman says. “That’s part of the point of the concert and what we’re celebrating on Friday.”
 
For the Collegium, working with Joyful Noise has been a moving and educational experience. “Something very striking when Joyful Noise sings is there’s a total loss of inhibition,” Collegium conductor Joseph Fort says. Collegium Music Director Andrew Clark agrees: “What Joyful Noise demonstrates is that powerful experiences with music aren’t always begun through the pathway of the mind but also a pathway through the heart.” Collegium President Maura D. Church ’14 recounts the story of a Joyful Noise member who, though unable to talk normally, can communicate through singing, and details the significant impact the choir has had on both its members and their loved ones. “Choral singing is greater than just one group, greater than an individual,” Church says.
 
With Boundless Realms of Joy, the Collegium is moving toward a greater awareness of a marginalized group’s experiences and showcasing music’s collaborative and unifying power. As Clark says, “The [Collegium] wanted to get to the heart of why we do what we do, and it was a chorus of individuals who society might think are deficient that had the answers.”

Few are unfamiliar with the comedy stylings of the Wayans brothers. From their popular television sitcom (“The Wayans Bros.”) to “White Chicks” and “Don’t be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,” the duo has helped to shape the landscape of both sketch and urban comedy.
  Marlon Wayans has been instrumental in the creation of the Wayans legacy. After acting in and directing the “Scary Movie” franchise, he began working on another type of horror-comedy film. In 2013, he released “A Haunted House,” a found-footage horror film he produced with a meager $1.5 million budget. The film’s box office success prompted its creators to start thinking about this year’s sequel, “A Haunted House 2.”
“I was approached about a sequel [for “A Haunted House”] two days after it premiered. I thought, ‘Y’all are crazy,’ but I eventually agreed to work on something if it felt right. A bunch of us started watching ‘Paranormal Activity’ and afterwards were exchanging notes and starting to write scenes.” After just 20 days of shooting, Wayans and co-producer Rick Alvarez finished shooting the $3 million independent film.  
  Wayans is adamant that his comedic films are not parodies of other works. “‘A Haunted House 2’ is not a parody. All of the material in the movie is original. Yes, there are some jokes that reference popular culture, but the situation is what drives the comedy. As a horror-comedy, this movie goes above and beyond what normal horror movies do.” To Wayans, parodies wholly copy original movies, whereas the “Haunted House” movies stand alone with original plots, characters, and scenarios. This distinction is important to him, as he has hopes to keep his films above the fray of what he calls “poorly-done pop culture parodies.”
Wayans realizes that this means that he must constantly keep innovating in order to stay on top in his genre. Though many believe he stepped into prominence as a result of his older brothers’ success, he reveals that roles were not handed to him without consideration. “I got my first big break in ‘Mo’ Money.’ My brother [Damon Wayans] wrote it. He made me try out for the part and told me that I probably wouldn’t get it because there was another guy they already liked. Before the audition, [Damon] told me to just make him laugh. In Wayans terms, that means bringing something to the page that wasn’t already there…. I had to be better than his jokes. I stunned them all. When I left, shit was on fire, like, boom.” From there, Wayans began to break into sketch comedy with "In Living Color.”
To Wayans, a film’s universality is one of its most important attributes. He notably includes a diverse cast in each of his films and heavily features ethnic humor as well. This diversity allows Wayans to appeal to many different types of people at once. “It is important to include perspectives from people of color in my movies because comedy has no color. In my generation, things were black and white. Now, everything is becoming mixed together. Laughter has no color. When I can see an audience overseas laughing at the same jokes that I made in America, that’s how I know that my comedy is universal,” Wayans said. This challenge is not always easily met. According to Wayans, his practice includes painstaking consideration. “Man, laughter is a hard emotion to evoke. You have to get everyone in an audience to feel the same way at the same time. Luckily, horror and comedy have a lot in common. There’s a buildup of tension, then boom—there’s some kind of release,” Wayans said.
  Marlon Wayans is a man of many talents, but he is adamant about not limiting himself to a specific medium. He aims to constantly challenge himself by creating films that attain a level of comedic success. “Writing movie scripts was something I always dreamed of. I have massive dreams; I want to build a brand for myself in comedy and be the best there ever was.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
These days, the catchword around sexual assault is “survivor.” Just like the survivor of a natural disaster, it makes one seem brave, even heroic. And, just like with a natural disaster, it makes the problem seem unavoidable and agentless.
I am wary of using the word “survivor” to describe myself. While some people have certainly survived their attack—they are strong and have put it behind them—that is not the case for me. 
I once told a friend that she was so brave for pursuing a case against her attacker. Her response disarmed me: “I want you to know that even if I wasn’t pursuing the case, even if I was in my room crying everyday, I would still deserve admiration.” I believe her answer gets to the bottom of why I find the word “survivor,” and all its connotations, offensive.
As much as we should admire the courage of women who seek justice from their abusers, we should show equal respect for the victims of sexual assault who remain quiet. Every day after their attack may be a struggle, and they are no less of a person for not pursuing charges. We might assume this is due to some weakness, but it could be due to a number of reasons.
Even if fear were one of those reasons, I must ask: What more of an excuse for fear does one need than experiencing sexual assault?
The victim-survivor dichotomy is just one subset of a long-running discussion of what it means to be a feminist or an independent woman. In a country like the U.S., where first-wave feminism (e.g. women’s suffrage) is already secured, the debate naturally turns more nuanced. What sort of adjectives should we ascribe to womanhood? I think the answer should be none: Each woman should choose her own qualities.
Indeed, part of the issue people see with “victim” is that the word seems distinctly feminine. Traditionally, feminism worked by advocating infiltration of male spheres, rather than expanding the choices and identities available for women. Examples include forcing women into the workplace and out of their homes, despite their own preferences. Although incontrovertibly groundbreaking at the time, this created the idea of a “successful” woman who was merely a woman in men’s clothing.
Sexual assault is a horrific crime because it takes away a sense of autonomy that we deeply value in our society. When it comes to our bodies (the most personal of our possessions), we expect to be the only person justified in making decisions. Those decisions can run the gamut from choosing whom to have sex with to remaining celibate until marriage.
And the ability to self-identify is an equally crucial right.
After my assault, I was most afraid of the pressure to come forward and be a role model. I was afraid of being expected to appear powerful when that was the last thing I felt. 
Back then, I had no forewarning of how to deal with sexual assault. But I understand that here at Harvard, a case against an attacker may depend on a victim decides to not go forward with it This puts an unnecessary and severe pressure on victims who are already dealing with the unthinkable. 
Reworking the terms of the Ad Board would be one meaningful way of putting less pressure on victims, and allowing them the peace of mind to recover fully. 
First, Harvard should stop referring to sexual assault cases as “peer disputes”—a phrase which implies that the case and its outcome have no relation to the overall university environment. 
Instead, why not model sexual assault cases on the way Harvard approaches plagiarism? Once the Ad Board takes up a plagiarism case, the investigation and trial are directed by the administration, rather than by the individual professor who brought the complaint. This is because plagiarism is taken as an affront to the academic culture of the school—not just a crime against an individual professor or an individual class, but the to the scholarship we demand of students.
It is absurd that the crime of sexual assault is not given the same treatment by the Ad Board. Just like with plagiarism cases, the University should be the one bringing sexual assault charges against the alleged perpetrator. Most of us remember the severity of the Gov 1310 cheating scandal 2 years ago—imagine if the school put the same resources behind investigating sexual assault complaints.
As expressed by Title IX statutes, sexual assault is more than a crime against one person—it can create a “hostile environment” that directly opposes the intellectual ambitions of the university environment. 
Administrative shifts aside, we students must create an accepting social space for victims. We should be careful not to over-exaggerate the need for strength in our women. Feminism is detrimental to women when it demands worship of just one ideal of womanhood. We need to stop telling girls that they can’t show weakness, that to do so somehow counteracts the work of Susan B. Anthony or Betty Friedan. When someone is a victim of sexual assault, they should be able to show weakness if they want to. It is certainly a situation in life when one feels alone, sad, and scared. Telling girls that showing their concerns will make them a “bad feminist” only traps them further in a cycle of guilt and despair. 
From now on, when people label me as a survivor, I aim to be more proactive. “No,” I’ll say, “I’m not quite there yet.” I’m still a victim in my mind. I still get nightmares and panic attacks. Worst of all, I still spend a great deal today thinking about the victimizers who turned me into a victim. This is another reason why I want to describe myself as a “victim.” 
It begs the question: Who made you a victim? 
Although I am still recovering, I have come to realize that I deserve respect more than anything right now. A huge part of that is respecting my choice—perhaps my inability—to press charges against my attacker. I still second-guess myself at times, wondering if that decision was a function of my meek personality. However, if that was the case, I know that not everyone can be a hero.
For me, and others, moving on takes time, and involves accepting our perceived weakness. In the words of my friend, all victims deserve admiration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
There’s a phenomenon at this school that is never discussed in campus publications, nor is it brought up in casual conversation. We pretend not to know or care about it. Yet it pervades and dictates our lives with a power that surpasses alcohol, classes, and Board Plus. We can’t shirk it from our attention any longer. So let’s talk about it. Let’s talk about campus-eye-contact-culture.
What is “campus-eye-contact-culture?” It’s a multi-faceted, multi-dimensional, and multi-hyphenated term that I just made up, and it encompasses the set of behaviors surrounding eye-contact on campus.
I’d say Harvard kids, overall, are very good at maintaining eye-contact. Whether connecting with a finance recruiter, connecting with an investment banker, or connecting with a finance recruiter, each Harvard student seems to have an uncanny ability to maintain an “adult” conversation, looking the other person straight in the eyes all the way.
That’s easy. But when you have such a high number of students who attend the same classes, live in the same Houses, or go to the same parties, much more ambiguous situations of eye-contact interaction are bound to arise. And the question we must ask as a campus-eye-contact-culture-concerned-community is, “How the Hell do we make those situations less awkward?”
Here’s a typical example: While walking in the Yard, you see someone that you used to see regularly in your freshman seminar. You are accustomed to saying a quick “hello” to the other person in passing but not much beyond that. However, on this occasion, you are all the way across the Yard from the other person, on the same path, walking towards one another, when you make initial eye-contact. Suddenly, your entire world boils down to a split-second choice between some not-so-great possibilities:
1. Yell your quick “Hello” across the Yard at the top of your lungs. In doing so, you expended your “hello” early, so you approach each other in silence, all while still making eye-contact or going in and out between phases of eye-contact that may or may not coincide with the other person’s. Additionally, the other person may look confused, wondering if it was really he or she that you were yelling at.
2. Maintain eye-contact for the entire 15 seconds it takes to get within speaking range. In doing so, you may trip on the brave squirrels or tourists in the path. Or you may make the other person feel awkward since you barely know them, causing them to avert their gaze, then look back at you to see if you are still looking at them, and then avert their gaze again, repeating the process until it’s safe to say “hello.”
3. Leap off the asphalt, vaulting over those flimsy string barrier things that are surprisingly good at keeping people off the grass, and drastically change your path.
4. Immediately avert your gaze while the other person does the same; that way, you both enter into a silent agreement not to look up again until you are at a more comfortable range.
There is no easy way out. Even the fourth option, the one that seems least awkward, is built upon a deep-seeded awkwardness. Fundamentally, you are both lying about the initial eye-contact, and you both know it. Like much of the ambiguities of campus-eye-contact-culture, the awkwardness is hidden.
This kind of “awkward undercurrent” is present in many other situations too: Should you make eye-contact in the hallway with that kid who speaks a lot in section, but who you have never really spoken to outside of class? What kind of greeting do you give your distinguished professor in passing? How do you interact with someone you think you may have hooked up with a few nights ago but can’t really remember? How do you avoid interacting with your ugly roommate—Andrew Wyner ’16?
We can’t let the awkward undercurrent persist. We should be bringing the awkwardness out, facing the problem head on, eye-to-eye. I’m thinking University task forces; I’m thinking Community Conversations; I’m thinking campus-eye-contact-culture-counselors. 
But there’s a problem: You can’t simply “talk about” eye-contact. That’s like talking to someone about toilet paper wiping strategies—it may lead to hugely time-saving dialogue, but it’s just too gross to be worth it. Similarly, as soon as you start talking to someone about eye-contact, you’re admitting that you are incapable of communicating with them on an even plane. Thus, any conversation you then have about eye-contact is doomed from the beginning. And it may lead to more awkwardness in the future.
So, if there’s no talking about it, what’s left? Well, you could leave Harvard. But then you’d realize that other people outside of Harvard have eyes too. And a lot of people in the “real world” are less awkward than Harvard students, amplifying your relative awkwardness.
And beyond that? Well, maybe that last point is exactly it. Maybe if we all just accept that everyone else at Harvard is a little awkward too, we can just relax about it. Awkwardness is, after all, the struggle of acting out a social norm. So if awkwardness becomes the accepted social norm, then there’s really no awkwardness at all.
I hope that makes sense. Anyway, those of you who’ve read this far know that I feel awkward, at least. And maybe because of that you won’t feel that awkward in the future. 
Unless you’re that kid from my freshman seminar. In which case, “Hi!” (Look down, end column.)

I can be pretty bossy.
If the Crimson style guidelines conformed to the worldview of Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, that opening sentence wouldn’t make it onto the page.
Sandberg wants to ban bossy (or, more accurately, #banbossy), so I’ll attempt for a moment to honor her wishes. If I can’t be pretty bossy, I can be pretty … empowered? Intent on leadership? Sandberg would have me sub in this word here or that phrase there. Why? To defeat sexism worldwide, of course! The problem is, that’s not what I mean.
Bossy is a word. It has a definition, and it’s a different one from “empowered” or “leaderly” (the latter of which may not be a word at all). A girl can be bossy, a boy can be bossy, and probably even a dog could boss around other dogs; we just wouldn’t know it. An order to say something else in place of bossy is an order to choose the wrong word over the right one.
 
I’m not denying that some harness the power of the English language for bad instead of good. I’m not denying that many people call girls bossy when they wouldn’t do the same to boys. But I am denying that attempting to ban a word does much more than make the last page of our dictionaries one inch shorter. Get rid of bossy, and those who want to use it cruelly will just switch to “domineering,” or “abrasive.” Those who want to use it just to describe someone fond of giving orders will begin using words that simply don’t mean what they’re pretending to mean.
 
In fact, banning bossy may do more harm than good. On the one hand, it cheapens arguments against words with legitimate claims to offensiveness, words deliberately designed to put down an entire race or class. Yes, we should stay away from the n-word. Same goes for the c-word. But if anything it’s a different b-word that we should worry about.
 
What’s more, suggesting that a phenomenon as far-reaching and insidious as the so-called “leadership gap” will—poof!—disappear with a shift in semantics slaps a Band-Aid on a bullet hole. We should not feel content with our contribution to a cause because we have eliminated an expression from our vocabulary. We need to do more, and patting ourselves on the back for easy, meaningless tasks only encourages us to do less.
 
The Ban Bossy campaign also neglects an important side of the issue. Society undervalues assertiveness in women. But it also undervalues traits more traditionally conceived as feminine, like cooperation and conciliation. Sandberg’s campaign works toward solving the first of these problems by lionizing women who seize control, and yet it does little to address the second. We shouldn’t only encourage women to embrace being large and in charge—we should also encourage men to embrace working together, even at the cost of sacrificing alpha-dog status.
 
Finally, it’s worth noting that a campaign like Ban Bossy often ends up alienating, not inspiring. Consider the liberal backlash directed at Sandberg’s effort. Presumably, most of these writers also wouldn’t mind if girls had a fair shot at success. But the campaign repels them, distracting their attention from the real issue at stake and driving them away when they could have—and would have—aided the underlying cause. This phenomenon hits particularly close to home; at Harvard, some members of the community feel compelled to censor and censure the speech and actions of their peers. But, for example, condemning students for engaging in microaggression—confusing them and repelling them when they could otherwise choose to sit down and explain the cause of the disease along with the symptoms—only further entrenches existing prejudice.
 
As a bossy person, I’d like to give us all an order. Let’s try to change things by doing something big, let’s look at the whole picture instead of a just a sliver, and let’s get everyone else to do it with us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Yesterday, more than 100 Harvard faculty members signed an open letter calling for Harvard University to divest from fossil fuel industries. Citing ethical, health-based, and financial concerns, the letter was the first major statement by University faculty in opposition to President Drew G. Faust’s stance against divestment, which she has reiterated several times since her October statement to the Harvard Community.
 
The letter reminds us that Harvard has an important role in discussions about climate change. We are part of a University that both contributes to public understanding about climate issues and works to find sustainable solutions. This is a fruitful area for discussion inside and outside Harvard Yard, and the open letter from the faculty is a welcome, engaging addition to the dialogue on campus.
 
Despite the letter’s reasoned arguments, we continue to oppose divesting the University endowment from the fossil fuel industry. As we opined last fall, while we understand the urgent necessity of environmental activism and awareness, Harvard would be better served by addressing these concerns in ways other than divestment.
 
Unlike the case of the tobacco industry, from which Harvard divested in the 1990s, the University will continue to utilize fossil fuels for its everyday functions, as will the rest of the world for the foreseeable future. Fighting climate change rests not on rejecting fossil fuel companies today, but rather on contributing to the development of new technologies and resources for tomorrow.
Activism, by both students and faculty, is an integral tradition and a vital outlet for student opinions and goals. However, movements must be responsible not only for their messages, but also for their tactics. Last month, student members of Divest Harvard uploaded a cleverly edited video of an interaction with President Faust in Harvard Yard that did not accurately show Faust’s complete opinion. Gimmicks aimed at demonizing opposition views do not move the conversation forward. Reasoned arguments—like those articulated in the open letter—do.
Furthermore, the University has taken steps forward with the recent adoption of responsible investment standards. This week, President Faust announced the commencement of new initiatives, including adherence to United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment. This will allow careful analysis of investments and strategies without total industry divestment. The open letter probed Harvard’s commitment to influencing its investments as a shareholder, and there is certainly room, short of divestment, for the University to use its leverage for positive ends.
 We applaud that faculty members have expressed their opinions in this important conversation. We need to continue to discuss these issues in a responsible manner. The Harvard administration should not take its faculty’s concerns lightly. Encouragingly, President Faust’s commitment to responsible investment standards is an indication that it doesn’t.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nearly 18 months of controversy and accusations of forgery, a fragment of parchment labeled by Divinity School Professor Karen L. King as the “Gospel of Jesus’s Wife” has now been dated to approximately the eighth century, according to an article published on Thursday in the Harvard Theological Review.
The fragment, which is only a few inches in length, contains several words in Coptic, an ancient language of Egyptian Christians, that translate to, “Jesus said to them, my wife.” The next line reads, “She will be able to be my disciple,” according to King’s translation.
King said that she obtained the piece from an anonymous donor in 2011 and originally believed that the fragment was torn from the middle of a larger papyrus dating back the fourth century.  The donor, who, King said, still wishes to remain anonymous, said that he or she does not know the origin of the artifact, but bought the piece along with other papyri many years before contacting King.
When she presented her finding in Rome a year later, King said that many critics, including the Vatican and other academics, claimed the artifact was a forgery. Though the fragment turned out to be nearly 400 years younger than King first predicted, she said that the current dating estimate of the piece at 741 C.E. still places it within the ancient world.
She added that she has never claimed that the piece proves that Jesus had a wife, but rather that it indicates that early Christian thinkers or writers were discussing the role of women in Christianity.
"The main topic of the fragment is to affirm that women who are mothers and wives can be disciples of Jesus—a topic that was hotly debated in early Christianity as celibate virginity increasingly became highly valued," King said in a statement Thursday.
Some scholars still question the authenticity of the piece even after MIT and Columbia University dated the papyrus to be from around the eighth century, and an investigation of the ink by Macquarie University revealed that there are no clear signs of forgery in the handwriting.
Leo Depuydt, an Egyptologist at Brown University, published an article in the Harvard Theological Review alongside King’s piece critiquing her analysis of the piece.
Depuydt pointed to grammatical mistakes in the artifact that he said would not have likely been made by a native writer of Coptic. He also noted similarities between King’s artifact and the writing of the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas, which might indicate that the fragment is part of a copy of the Gospel of Thomas.
King said that she hopes the scientific evidence dating the piece as ancient will dispel all rumors of forgery and allow both students and the public to discuss the broader implications of the piece.
“Certainly whenever it has been brought into the classroom, there has been much discussion,” King said in a conference call. “I am hoping we can turn away from the question of forgery...[to] questions of family, marriage, sexuality, and so forth.”

Harvard Legal Aid Bureau student attorneys Nicholas O. Pastan and Breana M. Ware presented their closing argument last Wednesday at the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, where they asked a judge to reject a petition to return their client’s children to Canada.
Since the case involved the Hague Convention, an international agreement regarding cross-country custody issues, Pastan and Ware had just six weeks to prepare for the trial—all while handling the workload of a Harvard Law School student.
The Harvard Legal Aid Bureau accepted the case in October to help the client, who fled Canada last fall with her children after years of alleged sexual and emotional abuse, procure an abuse prevention order against her former partner.
However, in December, Pastan was notified by the U.S. State Department that the children’s father had filed a petition pursuant to the Hague Convention, which protects a parent’s custody across international borders but does not apply if the child is subject to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm, according to Ware and Pastan.
Very few cases that the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau takes on end up in federal court, and even fewer are brought before a judge in merely six weeks, according to HLAB clinical instructor J. Verner Moore. After factoring in the language barrier—the client spoke Haitian Creole and French—the case proved to be exceptionally difficult.
“At the Legal Aid Bureau, we don’t do too many of these cases,” Moore said. “These are things a lot of lawyers never do during their career, and here are Nick and Breana doing them during law school.”
In addition, the entire burden of the case lies on the defendant—Pastan and Ware’s client—to prove that the children were removed from Canada without violating the Hague Convention.
Moore noted that Pastan and Ware returned from winter break early and began working on the case while also shouldering the workload of intensive three-week, winter term classes.
“Whatever they had to do, they did it,” Moore said. “It was just a delight working with them.”
Ware and Pastan said they took away a great deal from the experience.
“I almost certainly will not get this experience during the rest of my time at Harvard Law School, and it might be years even as a practicing attorney before I’m one of two attorneys or something on a federal case,” Pastan said.
However both noted that the case was much more than something to put on their resumes.
“We hopefully made the process a little less painful and anxiety-ridden for [our client],” said Ware, who added that developing a relationship with the client figured most in her experience.
“The thought of her having to go back to the situation that she was in before coming to the U.S. is so devastating that being able to represent her and to let her get a new start with her and her kids is really exciting,” Pastan said. 
The case remains open as Pastan and Ware await the judge’s decision, but Moore said that he feels optimistic that the decision will go their way.

UPDATED: April 11, 2014, at 2:51 p.m.
At the Graduate Student Council’s annual elections on Wednesday, many students involved with the Harvard Teaching Campaign were among the candidates elected as GSC officers.
GSC President Summer A. Shafer and Secretary Darcy Frear were elected once more to thier executive positions. At-large represetnative for Social Sciences John Gee was elected vice president.
Elaine F. Stranahan, Rachel Poser, and John M. Nicoludis were all elected for the first time as the at-large representatives for Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary Students, and Natural Sciences, respectively. Meanwhile, Caley C. Smith maintained his position as at-large representatives of Humanities.
A new treasurer was elected, with Jordan Smith replacing Janis V. Calleja, while current vice president Shelley H. Liu lost her bid for president.
Five international graduate students, including Jae-hyun Lee, the GSC’s former publicity manager who was removed from his post in the days before the election, ran for the role as at-large representative for international students, with Rachel H. Y. Leng ultimately securing the position.
“I think everyone was very surprised and enthused to see that there were five write-in candidates for the position of international students at-large representative,” Leng said. “This indicates that we certainly have a diverse population of international students on campus who are vested in their peers' experience at Harvard.”
Leng hopes to improve the involvement of the GSC in regards to the needs of internationals students. In particular, she aims to provide further support for those adjusting to life in the U.S., both in and out of the classroom, as well as with individualized support for filing tax returns in greater cooperation with the Harvard International Office.
During the meeting, the GSC also discussed a proposal to set a limit on section sizes for classes. Five of the elected officers are active in the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a movement of graduate students seeking to cap section sizes.
The general consensus among the graduate students was the desire to change the Faculty of Arts and Sciences current policy so that teaching fellows can teach smaller sections, receive pay on time, and establish a more stable pre-enrollment system, according to Shafer.
“We will organize to accomplish those goals, regardless of administration policy,” Shafer said.

CORRECTIONS: April 11, 2014
 
 
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the incumbency status of several newly elected members of the Council. In fact, John Gee, Elaine F. Stranahan, Rachel Poser, and John M. Nicoludis were all elected to their positions for the first time this year. The earlier version also incorrectly stated presidential candidate Shelley H. Liu’s current position on the Council. In fact, she is currently vice president. The earlier version also incorrectly stated when and why Jae-hyun Lee, a write-in candidate for representative at-large of international students, was removed from his earlier post as Council publicity manager. In fact, Lee was removed before the election for not fulfilling the roles of his position. Finally, the article incorrectly stated that there is currently no at-large representative of international students. In fact, Lilei Xu currently holds that position.

The Harvard Political Review, a journal supported by the Institute of Politics, published its “Annual Report of the United States of America” for the 2013 fiscal year on Thursday, offering a detailed review and analysis of U.S. fiscal policy and its predicted impact on the nation.
The report, subtitled “What Every Citizen Should Know About the REAL State of the Nation,” was produced by 10 students and published in partnership with the non-profit American Education Foundation.
It features an overview of the country’s current fiscal position, as well as a detailed review of federal spending in areas such as social insurance, defense, education, and agriculture.
According to the 86-page report, without reform, Social Security beneficiaries will face a 23 percent benefit cut in 2033. The report also found that the growth of the cost for Medicare has been slowing and that many tax expenditures disproportionately benefit high-income taxpayers.
“A real challenge remains overcoming today's bitter partisanship and governmental gridlock to not only ensure progress, but also show millennials and all our citizens that Washington, D.C.—and our democratic process—can still work and make a difference,” C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, director of the IOP, wrote in an email.
The report was founded in 1995 by AEF’s Executive Director Meredith E. Bagby ’95 when she was an undergraduate at the College working for the IOP.
“Back in those days, producing the report was difficult because there was no internet and we couldn’t look up the numbers,” Bagby said. “But even when information is readily available today, it’s still produced in a way that is not very digestible for a regular citizen."
According to Daniel E. Backman ’15, the report’s student executive editor and president of the Harvard Political Review, the report seeks to make information on the federal budget—often complex and scattered—accessible to the average citizen.
“The major theme of the report is that our government is fairly dysfunctional in terms of budget policy,” Backman said. “There is a huge disconnect between what’s useful and what’s getting done, and people not aware of what’s going on.”
Bagby, who witnessed the growth of the report since 1995, echoes this sentiment.
“Even though it’s been 20 years [since the first report], the fundamental ways in which we spend money in this country [have] not changed,” Bagby said. “The most troubling trend is that there’s no trend.”
In a call for action, Backman wrote in the report’s introduction, “Ask yourself, after reading this report, whether that budget truly represents your values. If not, do something about it.”

Employing assured language and channeling scientific consensus, University President Drew G. Faust laid out a three-part initiative in a letter to the community on Monday to position Harvard as a leader in the effort to combat climate change. By investing more in climate research, accelerating sustainability efforts on campus, and signing onto the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment, Faust wrote that Harvard would help lay “the path to a sustainable future.”
Yet, in the days following Faust’s announcement, sustainability and investment experts said they are less sure that one of those parts—the change to Harvard’s investment principles—goes far enough to have more than a symbolic impact. Those experts caution that the voluntary nature of the PRI principles, while laudable, are closer to a statement of values than an actual policy for governing Harvard’s $32.7 billion endowment.
Launched in 2006 under the guidance of then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, the PRI Initiative brings together more than 1,200 institutional investors managing a total of more than $34 trillion assets around the common goal of integrating environmental, sustainability, and governance (ESG) standards into their investment management. Harvard’s is the first university endowment in the U.S. to adhere to the framework.
The PRI framework is centered around six principles, which include incorporating ESG considerations into investment decisions and corporate management, advocating for portfolio company transparency related to ESG issues, and reporting regularly on ESG-related progress.
While the PRI initiative provides specific suggestions for ways to reach these goals, the principles themselves are “voluntary and aspirational,” according to the PRI website and echoed in Faust’s announcement. The initiative also frequently acknowledges investment management funds’ ultimate responsibility of maximizing returns for its beneficiaries, and notes that funds should implement changes, “where consistent with [their] fiduciary responsibilities."
This non-binding framework has caused many to question whether or not agreeing to the PRI will result in any concrete or significant changes to the way the Harvard Management Company oversees its endowment.
“The PRI is laudable, but as far as I know, it’s purely a voluntary initiative that doesn’t require actual behavior change,” said Medical School professor James M. Recht, one of the principal authors of an open letter to Faust signed by more than 100 faculty members calling for fossil fuel divestment.
“I do think it’s better than nothing, but I think it would be a terrible shame if someone were to walk away from that statement thinking that somehow becoming a participant in PRI is anywhere close to the type of action that this climate emergency calls for,” Recht added.
David Wood, director of the Initiative for Responsible Investment, a research organization housed in the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at the Kennedy School, noted that the the principles’ impact on the investments of the other signatories of the PRI have been mixed.
“What we’ve seen with other signatories is that some have developed very robust programs and some have not,” Wood said.
 
Shoshana Zuboff, a retired Business School professor who also signed the faculty letter supporting divestment, similarly questioned the net impact of the feedback PRI analysis given that Harvard will continue to invest in the top fossil fuel companies.
“As long as we are continuing to invest in the 200 top fossil fuel companies, we have neutered any value we can extract from being signatories in this index,” Zuboff said.
  
Despite these concerns, many emphasized that Harvard’s endorsement of the PRI carries with it symbolic weight. Bill E. McKibben ’82, an environmental activist and author, said that the decision suggests an evolution in the University’s stance on sustainability issues.
“Once you’ve accepted the principle that your investments carry with them a political burden, then it’s only a matter of time before they end up divesting from their fossil fuel stock,” said McKibben, a former Crimson president. “This won’t satisfy people demanding divestment, but it does show that people demanding divestment are making progress.” 
But becoming a signatory to PRI is not necessarily a first step down the road to divestment. Many PRI signatories have not divested from their fossil fuel holdings, and on Thursday, Faust once more reaffirmed her stance despite growing faculty support for the movement.
Still, experts agreed that the recognition of ESG considerations serves as progress and a foundation for ongoing dialogue. The sixth PRI principle, which requests that signatories “report on [their] activities and progress in implementing the principles,” requires the submission of an annual, publicly-available progress report.
“It does create a reporting framework on how they’ve been implementing [the principles] so it will be a way for people who want to engage the endowment to have that discussion,” said Wood of the principle.

David Royce ’56—a sharp-penned cartoonist, controversial political activist, and the “alleged purloiner of the [Harvard Lampoon’s] Thresky Ibis”—died April 4 in Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. after a two-year bout with lymphoma. He was 82.
Known for his eccentric brilliance, steady artistic hand, and penchant for mischief, Royce earned his spot in Harvard history after stealing the ibis that sits atop the headquarters of the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. The large metallic bird was presented by Crimson editors as a gift to the Soviet Union’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations.
“He was an infestation of mischief personified,” Arthur J. Langguth ’55, a former president of The Crimson, wrote in an email. “His ribald eye was too unblinking for that era of euphemism and parietal rules.”
After graduating from Harvard in 1956, Royce served as an enlisted soldier in the U.S. Army in the Korean War, before settling in Westport, Conn., where he became known as a political activist and a local gadfly. He tried his hand at political cartooning for a number of newspapers, though never held a long-term job after college.
Yet, friends and family said they remember Royce for his mystery, unpredictability, and independent streak.
“He was a dreamer,” said George S. Abrams ’54, a former managing editor of The Crimson and a current trustee. “You never knew when he would pop up or what he would want to talk about.” 
No one interviewed about Royce’s life could remember when he comped The Crimson, rather it seemed to many that he simply appeared and began his work as a cartoonist.
“Royce's connection with The Crimson was mysterious,” Langguth wrote. “[He] turned up at the paper one day and began to live in the Sanctum.”
It was equally difficult to discern how Royce captured the elusive ibis, which sits precariously perched on the peak of the Lampoon Castle’s roof.
“I don’t know how he ever did it but he climbed up and brought the Ibis down,” said Abrams, who diplomatically presented the Ibis in the midst of the Cold War to Russian diplomat Semyon K. Tsarapkin for the newly-constructed Moscow University.  
Since the early 1950s, Royce had caricatured every Crimson president, copies of which encircle the newsroom of the newspaper’s Plympton St. headquarters.
“They’re good cartoons—they capture those people,” Abrams said.
In his adult life, Royce religiously attended meetings at Westport’s town hall, penned letters to the Westport News, and even filed a suit against the city in the 1970s when he felt that inspectors had wrongly entered his property.
“He spoke his mind without regard to what other people said,” said his wife, Nina Royce, noting that “his opinions have been good and bad.” 
“My father was an immensely capable and complex man, but in many very important ways, whether due to his nature or some aspect of his childhood experience, he never got beyond the child that thought he was smarter than all the adults,” said Royce’s son, Zachary Royce, in his father’s eulogy.
Royce was born in Rochester, N.Y. to Nancy Reyna and Edward Royce. He is the grandson of Josiah Royce, the American idealist philosopher who taught at Harvard for over 30 years.
Royce is survived by his wife of 46 years and his three children.

Northwestern University law professor and Islamic law expert Kristen A. Stilt will join the Harvard Law School faculty this fall, according to a Law School press release.
 
Stilt, who holds a dual appointment at Northwestern’s law school and history department, will also serve as co-director of the Islamic Legal Studies Program, along with law professor Intisar A. Rabb.
 
“It is unusual to find in one person a learned scholar, imaginative writer, and inspired teacher, yet Kristen Stilt is precisely a triple threat,” Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said in the announcement. “Her acclaimed expertise in the history of Islamic law in practice in society and her knowledge of contemporary issues in the Middle East undergird her vivid writings.”  
In 1989, Stilt graduated magna cum laude with Phi Beta Kappa honors from the University of Texas with a degree in Middle Eastern studies. She then went on to University of Texas School of Law, where she graduated with honors and served as an editor of the Texas Law Review and editor-in-chief of Texas Journal of Women and the Law.
 
After briefly practicing law and working for the United Nations, Stilt enrolled at Harvard University, where she earned her Ph.D. in history and Middle Eastern studies in 2004.
 
Stilt taught at Boston University and the University of Washington and also served as a visiting associate professor at Harvard Law School before joining the Northwestern faculty in 2012.
 
“Joining the HLS faculty is a tremendous privilege,” Stilt said in the announcement. “HLS is an ideal place to further my broad scholarly interests and tackle pressing contemporary problems, and I look forward to the interactions with my new colleagues and students that will enhance both endeavors.”

Approximately 200 community members, transportation officials, and elected representatives gathered to voice their opinions and goals for the $260 million Allston interchange project Thursday evening. The project will impact Harvard-owned land.
 
The meeting, run by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and held at the Jackson Mann School in Allston, kicked off the preliminary planning process for the development that will straighten the portion of the Massachusetts Turnpike that spans Allston, introduce all-electronic tolling, and—many community members hope—increase pedestrian and cyclist connections between Allston Village, North Allston, and the Charles River area.
 
The realignment of the turnpike, which is expected to begin in 2017, will take place on Harvard-owned land. Harvard is expected to receive the land on which the existing Mass. Pike viaduct stands after the realignment is complete in 2020. Kevin Casey, the University’s acting vice president for public affairs, previously said the school will discuss the land’s future with the state.
“I’m so impressed with the massive turnout [at the meeting],” Massachusetts State Representative Kevin G. Honan said. “This project seeks to do so many good things...including reuniting North Allston with South Allston,” he added, referring to a neighborhood divide that is largely attributed to the current Mass. Pike orientation.
 
After a preliminary introduction of potential development designs including a variety of concepts for interchanges between the Pike and the neighborhood, MassDOT officials opened the floor up to the community, offering each commenter two minutes to address the development team with questions or comments on the plan. Every person who expressed a desire to speak upon signing in before the meeting was offered a chance to comment.
The majority of comments focused on the challenges faced by cyclists in the Allston-Brighton area and the hope that the Mass. Pike realignment could create solutions to many transportation problems besides those faced by drivers.
 
“I bike, I drive, I walk, and all of those things are the most abysmal things that could happen to you on Cambridge St. currently,” commenter David Maerz said. He called the Mass. Pike project “the most transformative thing that could happen to Allston,” requesting that the project include a broad scope that goes beyond highway development.
 
Allston resident Harry E. Mattison echoed the call for a broader scope.
 
“It’s a transportation and highway project, but it also needs to be about a community project that will make this neighborhood a better place to live, work, and visit,” Mattison said.
 
Numerous commenters mentioned improved bike lanes and paths, safer street crossings, and better managed vehicular traffic as neighborhood improvements that could be produced by the Mass. Pike realignment project.
 
There was also discussion of the fate of the land, much of which will be owned by Harvard, that will be freed up after the construction is complete. 
Massachusetts State Senator William N. Brownsberger called Harvard “the elephant in the room,” asking what role the University would play in future development of the vacant land around the construction site. The development team and MassDOT officials said it was too early to know any details about land beyond the turnpike realignment itself.
 
Commenters from the community expressed gratitude for the willingness of the MassDOT officials to welcome input from the community.
 
Allston resident Galen M. Mook called the meeting a “good show of good faith, considering some of the projects that have happened in the neighborhood.”
 
Community members said they hope this transparency will continue throughout the development process.
“Thank you to MassDOT for having a good, open, back-and-forth process from the very beginning,” commenter Jessica Roberts said.

Cornel R. West ’74, American philosopher and former Harvard professor spoke Thursday afternoon in Emerson Hall about black political thought, philosophy, and religion at an event hosted by the Harvard Black Men’s Forum.
“For me, Dr. West has been someone who has really shaped the way that I experience and view the world,” said BMF Executive Programs Director Temitope A. Agabalogun ’15, who introduced West.
West spoke about his time as an African American student in the early 1970s at the College. West recalled the words his father said to him when he was dropped off at school for the first time: “‘Son, you shape this place in your image at your best, and allow yourself to be shaped in its image at its very best.’” Inspired by his father’s words, West said he was determined to spread messages of justice and freedom at Harvard and beyond.
West began the discussion by describing what it means to be a person of color and to come from a “terrorized, stigmatized, and traumatized people.” He shared four questions that have guided his life and work, “how does integrity face oppression, what does honesty do in the face of deception, what does decency do in the face of insult, and how does virtue meet brute force.” 
West also discussed the role religion has played in his life. He defined himself as a prophetic Christian. He said he believes corporate media in the U.S. promotes materialism and greed, arguing that the it has created a society which is centered on becoming wealthy.
“Rich in what?...things, commodities, and money,” West asked the audience. “Or service and compassion?” He asked that the students in the audience question the pursuits they devote themselves to in the future.
West also spoke about black political class in the U.S., which he said should not worry about defining itself as an “interest group,” but should focus on promoting fairness, justice, and freedom across the board.
Still, West finished on a positive note, saying that “Harvard is going to continually produce some high quality folk,” who he is certain will spread the messages of justice and freedom in the future.
 Previously a faculty member in Harvard’s African and African American Studies Department, West left Harvard in 2002 for Princeton after a dispute with then-University President Lawrence H. Summers.

The last time the Harvard softball team (17-11, 3-0 Ivy) lost was exactly three weeks ago. The Crimson put its seven game win streak on the line Thursday, traveling to Rhode Island (9-21, 4-2 Atlantic 10) after the game was postponed due to rain.
Though Ivy League play has commenced, Harvard continued its hot streak against the Rams with another dominant performance in the 5-1 victory. Junior pitcher Laura Ricciardone took the circle and the spotlight for the Crimson on the day.
Ricciardone has been stalwart for Harvard all season and showed no signs of slowing down on Wednesday afternoon. The junior currently has a 2.05 ERA, second best in the Ivy League, and holds a 9-5 record.
But in the second inning of Thursday’s contest, Ricciardone showed off another facet of her game. After notching a strikeout and shutting out URI in the first frame, the score was 0-0 in the second inning. From there, the Crimson began to put away its opponent.
After junior infielder Emily Gusse singled to left field, Ricciardone stepped to the plate. Ricciardone blasted a two-run home run over the fence, the first of her career.
“It was my third pitch of the at bat and had just swung and missed,” Ricciardone said. “I was thankful to get the opportunity to help my team on the offensive side and put some runs on the board and get our team offensively started.”
The inning wasn’t over yet though for Rams’ pitcher Caitlin Kennedy. Freshman Catherine Callaway drew the walk and junior Katherine Appelbe singled to left field. After a sacrifice bunt advanced the runners, co-captain Shelbi Olson singled to center field, stretching her hitting streak to nine straight games.
The hit brought in two runs and gave Harvard all the breathing room it would need. Ricciardone shut URI out for next three innings, allowing only two hits and striking out two batters.
From there, freshman Taylor Cabe pitched another three frames. While Cabe did give up a run in the bottom of the fifth inning, the Rams never seemed to pose much of a threat for the confident Crimson squad.
In the top of the fourth frame, Appelbe got Harvard going once again. After another single to left, junior Andrea Del Conte singled to center. Then, Olson came through with another piece of hitting.
The senior singled to right, driving in Appelbe and giving Harvard a 5-0 lead.
“Shelbi is a very consistent hitter for us in the leadoff spot and is very reliable,” Ricciardone said. “She is a great source of consistency both defensively and offensively for the team.”
During Harvard’s win streak, the team has scored five or more runs in each of its contests, taking much of the weight off of its pitching staff’s shoulders. Leading the way has been Olson, who is batting .354 to go along with 14 RBIs.
While co-captain Kasey Lange had a quieter than usual day, the senior has already blasted four homeruns, as well as driven in 21 runs. Harvard’s offense has also torched its Ancient Eight competition, averaging 7.25 runs per a game in the league this season.
“We are finally hitting our stride and starting to play Harvard softball more consistently,” Ricciardone said. “Our offense is really coming alive. This half of the season we have seen a lot of pitchers and had a lot of at-bats, so everyone’s eyes are really on point.”
But offense hasn’t been the only key to the win streak, as the team has become much more sound on defense since returning from its spring road trip in California. The last official time Harvard gave up more than three runs was March 19, a game they won 9-4.
Heading into the weekend, the Crimson have a tough schedule, so only playing one game this week was very important. Harvard will take on league rival Brown, playing two double headers in a two-day span.
“We felt like it was good preparation for the weekend to get a single game in,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “We are excited to play in some nice weather. I think we are starting to get on a roll and we are excited to have a nice weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In one of college sports’ oldest rivalries, the Harvard men’s basketball team stormed into Yale’s Payne Whitney Gymnasium on March 7 looking to clinch the Ivy League title outright for the third straight year.
 
Eight minutes into the first half, Yale freshman Anthony Dallier entered the game for the first time, tapping out junior Armani Cotton and immediately getting matched up with Harvard co-captain Laurent Rivard. Eleven seconds later, the Bulldogs drew a foul on Harvard sophomore Evan Cummins, who immediately headed to the bench and took a seat alongside teammates junior Matt Brown and freshman Zena Edosomwan.
 
In 40 minutes, the six never took the court at the same time. Yet, only five years ago, they had battled hundreds of times together in the same high school gym at Northfield Mount Hermon, a small New England prep school that was the best-represented institution on the Payne Whitney hardwood.
 
NMH trumpets its basketball roots—on its basketball webpage, 2013 NCAA Tournament diaper dandy and NMH alumnus Spike Albrecht is pictured front and center. But the sophomore Michigan point guard isn’t the focal point of head coach John Carroll’s note to visitors. Instead, Carroll proudly writes, “In 2013-2014, NMH will have 11 players in the Ivy League, which is over three times more than any other school in the nation.”
 
Carroll has been at the helm of NMH’s program since 2001, and in this time he has built a dynasty with rosters that have included NCAA champions, McDonald’s All-American Nominees and Academic All-Americans. His players are known for entering Division I basketball programs and being ready to compete on the hardwood from move-in day.
 
When Tommy Amaker was hired as Harvard’s head coach in 2007, tapping into this talent became a priority of his that has transformed into a luxury over the past seven seasons. In those seven seasons, Amaker has added 28 recruits from prep schools—five from NMH. His first year, prep school students composed barely a quarter of the roster; five years later, 86 percent of the players had prep school roots. While Ivy League admissions officers have traditionally traveled to prep schools in search of top students, the trend of Ivy League coaches heading into prep schools gyms for premier prospects is much newer.
 
FIVE-STAR STUDENT-ATHLETES
 
A high school sophomore at the time, as Brown watched fifth-seeded USC defeat Arkansas and Texas at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena in 2007, he could certainly see himself playing there in the NCAA Tournament in a few years. While he had the location and tournament right, the colors that he would be wearing were a little different.
 
At the time, USC was led by current Los Angeles Lakers guard Nick Young and Chicago Bulls forward Taj Gibson. The Trojans played in the powerhouse Pac-12 conference, featured a national schedule, and was one of the fast rising programs in the NCAA with the nation’s No. 2 recruiting class with top prospect and current Milwaukee Bucks forward O.J. Mayo according to Rivals.com. Everything a high school sophomore could want in a program and all in sunny Los Angeles.
 
After Brown’s sophomore year at Barrington High School, the list of college coaches knocking on his door stretched all the way from Rhode Island to Los Angeles. Nonetheless, Gill, Mass. would be his next stop.
 
But Brown would have been the last person to guess he’d be at NMH after his sophomore season, in which he averaged over 20 points a game for Barrington. Instead, Brown was busy visiting the hottest basketball schools in the country, with each coach courting his talents.
 
“I went out [to USC] and visited and was close to committing,” said Brown. “Notre Dame was recruiting me for basketball and football.”
 
But as Brown continued to impress coaches on his AAU team, the Rhode Island Hawks, another coach caught sight of his talents. Carroll saw the athletic guard at a local tournament and convinced him to take a visit. While Brown looked at other prep schools, such as Deerfield and Exeter, he eventually decided to attend NMH and reclassify as a sophomore. Once at NMH, Brown became a perfect illustration of the ever-changing landscape in college basketball.
 
NMH plays in arguably the toughest division in high school basketball, with a travel schedule that takes the team across the nation and a practice plan that is modeled after top-tier Division I basketball programs. In Brown’s senior season, NMH lost in the national championship game on a buzzer-beater.
 
“I remember I’d be shooting a free throw and see [former West Virginia coach] Bob Huggins watching through the gym,” said Brown. “Any major school from Duke to Florida to Kansas to Kentucky, I have seen them consistently.”
 
When the recruiting process heated up after Brown’s first year at NMH, he sat down for a meeting with Carroll to weigh out his college options. At the time, Brown had his sights set on playing for a national powerhouse, and attending anything less was almost laughable.
 
“I wasn’t really looking at the Ivy League because I wanted to play Big East, Big Ten,” said Brown. “So when the Ivy schools were coming to recruit me I wasn’t interested.”
 
But Carroll has always stressed to his players the importance of attending schools that excelled not only athletically but also academically. So, Carroll made a point to send his star guard to Harvard’s Crimson Elite basketball camp in the winter of 2008.
 
“Coach Amaker is a top-level recruiter and he sat me down and sold me on what has happened [at Harvard],” Brown said. “He sold us on that seven or six years ago, telling us what we were going to do and how we were going to do it. I know I bought into that vision and he said ‘Matt, this is Harvard University. This is the best university in the country. What other things can you say you were the first person to do there?’”
 
After the camp, Brown’s next meeting with Carroll went much differently. Now he was the one explaining why Harvard was the right choice for him.
 
Brown became another name in the rapidly growing list of highly recruited players to choose an Ivy League school. In previous years, playing Ivy League basketball meant sacrificing the opportunity to play in front of a national audience in return for an unparalleled diploma. But with Amaker coaching Harvard and Cornell making the Sweet Sixteen, the league had begun to gain back respect for a conference that had not been on the national radar since the 1970s.
 
The conference is more than a one-man show, however. For a league that was previously considered an afterthought, the Ivy League has brought down Big East, Pac-10, and Big Ten giants in the tournament the past five years.
 
“It is as good a group of coaches as the Ivy League has ever had I think,” said Carroll. “They’ve had really really great coaches historically, but across the board, you have real depth, knowledge, and expertise. Some really good guys, excellent recruiters, they understand their universities. I think this as good as it gets or as good as its gotten as far as the eight Ivy League schools.”
 
As the competition of the Ivy League has increased, so have the number of recruits from prep schools attending the Ancient Eight. Top recruits have flocked to schools like NMH to better their academic standing and receive an offer to play Ivy League basketball.
 
“The prep schools are great for a number of different reasons,” Yale coach James Jones said. “Some kids, it bolsters them academically. It helps them because they can take classes that will be helpful going forward.”
 
The prep-to-Ivy route has become more common and consistent as the Ancient Eight has come up with wins against the likes of Arizona, Cincinnati, and Wisconsin. The Ivy League is also now in its second year of a television contract with NBC Sports. In 2013-2013, this contract extended to 39 televised games, not including the two tournament games apiece Harvard and Yale played in front of national audiences.
 
“I think [the NMH grads at Harvard] could all play in power conferences,” Albrecht said. “I tell Evan that all the time. He had a bunch of big time offers but he chose to stay locally. I can’t blame him going to the best school in America.”
 
EVERYTHING NORTHFIELD
 
Cummins, like Edosomwan and Brown, was highly recruited out of NMH. But his preparation for Division I basketball began long before Amaker stepped into the NMH gym.
 
Every year, hundreds of Division I college coaches make trips across the country to watch high school prospects compete in league games, tournaments, and showcases. But although the focus is most often put on players once they have displayed college-level potential, the athletes’ preparation and schooling decisions begin much earlier.
 
Carroll is constantly on the lookout for basketball talent that matches his philosophy. As he strives to make NMH the best academic and basketball school in the country for students preparing for college, Carroll scans the internet for videos and highlight clips of athletes that could fit his program.
 
He is often the one reaching out to players like Albrecht, convincing them to consider his school, telling them that NMH can offer a proven and developed basketball program that has sent almost 60 of its hoops stars to Division I programs. After refining his program over the past decade, Carroll can offer something that public schools and even most private institutions and prep schools cannot: the opportunity to play college basketball—in high school.
 
Cummins was another recruit that Carroll pushed hard for. After considering the Phillips Exeter and NMH, Cummins transferred to Carroll’s program after his sophomore year in high school, fully convinced by the merits of Carroll’s program.
 
“Athletically, Coach Carroll does a lot of work talking with college coaches about everything,” Cummins said. “Whether its how they schedule their practices, [and other] things like that. He makes an effort to make his program as close as possible to a college program.”
 
And while winning championships is one of Carroll’s goals, his ultimate focus is far beyond taking home a prep school title. He wants to ensure that his players not only reach the next level but also go the extra mile.
 
“The idea of coming to NMH is to get the preparation and the exposure academically, socially, and athletically to not just get to these great colleges but to also excel once they are there,” Carroll said. “It all starts before their arrival here. They have an intent. They have goals, dreams, and aspirations to be at the level. When they get here, we go to work for them to get them the exposure they are looking for.”
 
Part of that exposure comes automatically with the competition that NMH faces on a week-to-week basis in the New England Prep School Athletic Conference, whose Class AAA division has in recent years produced Nik Stauskas, Maurice Harkless, and Andre Drummond. The top-notch level of play prepares prospects for college basketball, while also bringing dozens Division I talent evaluators and coaches to games.
 
“When we used to play at NMH our conference had three or four, up to seven or eight Division I players,” Albrecht said. “These were big time players you were playing against. All of the size and athleticism was much like college basketball.”
 
Along with competing on the court, potential recruits spend much of their time ensuring that their work in the classroom meets the necessary academic standards. To bridge the gap between high school and college, Carroll’s college-esque athletic program is coupled with an academic structure that is specifically tailored for potential Division I athletes.
 
“We’re not a high school--the only high school thing about us is the age of our kids,” Carroll said. “I call this a pre-college.... We’re as close to college as you can get.”
 
With students taking three full-year courses each semester and six total for the year, the school work is specifically aligned to be as close to a college curriculum as possible.
 
“Most high schools stop at AP Calculus, but these kids can go years beyond that here,” Carroll said. “[Students] can take linear algebra and number theory, so they have that opportunity to be in a collegiate type of experience [at NMH].”
 
Switching schools also gives players more flexibility in the recruiting process, as transferring to NMH often entails a reclassification of the student’s current grade. The process is designed to allow the players an extra year of recruiting and academic preparation and, according to Cummins, most players at NMHtake advantage of the opportunity to get ahead.
 
“As far as coursework, I took all of my junior classes as a sophomore,” Cummins said. “It’s helpful having another year to mature both on the court and off, [and] it’s huge in preparing for college life and college basketball in general.”
 
Part of that preparation often includes retaking standardized tests in order to reach academic thresholds, especially the high bar set in place by the Ivy League. The Academic Index, a two-part measure that assesses a prospective student on their grades and standardized test scores, weighs heavily during Ivy League recruiting season. In a conference without athletic scholarships, each student must be thoroughly vetted by the admission committee before being admitted into the school.
 
For some NMH athletes, the additional year was a chance to reach certain score benchmarks. Edosomwan transferred to NMH after he was thrice unable to earn the SAT score in high school required to qualify under Academic Index regulations.
 
Similarly, Albrecht, recruited by Brown University out of high school, was told his senior year that he was a point short on his ACT of meeting the necessary academic benchmarks. When Carroll came calling, persuading Albrecht to look at prep school as a way of improving his scores, he transferred to NMH and used the extra year as a chance to hone his scores and basketball game.
 
“The only reason I was going out there was [that] I was planning on playing basketball and getting my grades up,” Albrecht said. “[I wanted] my SAT and ACT scores a little higher so that I could get into an Ivy League [school].”
 
THE NORTHFIELD NETWORK
 
While Albrecht came to Massachusetts with his eye on the Ivy League, his play and the school’s exposure caught the eye of Michigan coach John Beilein. With then-freshman Trey Burke considering leaving the Wolverines after a disappointing first-round tournament exit, Beilein needed an insurance policy. A Midwesterner himself, Albrecht wanted to go home. He visited Michigan and instantly committed.
 
However, Albrecht’s road was the one less traveled. The ties between NMH and the Ivy League run extremely deep. Although NMH has sent more players to Harvard than any other school, Carroll’s players dot rosters across the Ancient Eight.
 
“Over the last seven years we’ve sent at least one player to every Ivy League school,” Carroll said. “We currently have three at Dartmouth, two at Yale, two at Brown, [and] one at Princeton.”
 
Beyond the players that have already been recruited and matriculated to Ivy League schools, the increase in numbers have important implications for the future prep-to-Ivy connection.
 
“When our kids visit these schools, they can have conversations ahead of time with our players and alumni, and then also times they get hosted by our players when they’re there,” Carroll said. “They feel like the visit and information they are getting is a lot more genuine, because it is within the NMH family.”
 
The recruitment structure presents an opportunity to both sides; from the recruit’s perspective, the personal attention and trust with the NMH college athletes in the Ivy League helps ease the otherwise stressful process.
 
“It was easy to talk to [Crimson players] about their experience here and what it was like,” Cummins said. “Coming up to visit and being able to stay with guys that you were friends with from school. It definitely helped. The biggest thing [was] being able to get honest evaluations of every place throughout the Ivy league was a big role.”
 
For the institution, the NMH family provides a welcoming committee and, in turn, an increased likelihood of a commitment. Brown says that he personally reaches out to NMH players Amaker is scouting, serving as their guide when they take campus visits.
 
“When they come up here, [you] take them under your wing and show them the ropes and open the eyes to what Harvard can give them,” Brown said.
 
In this way, the rise of Ivy League recruiting is self-fulfilling; once the core base of former NMH and other prep school players is established, the growing relationships bring in more top-flight prospects, further strengthening the program. There is perhaps no better example than Edosomwan—the highest profile recruit to hit Harvard’s campus this century.
 
When Edosomwan actively chose to attend NMH in order to meet the Academic Index and qualify to play at Harvard, he became a pioneer. A player of Edowsoman’s talent would be seen much more of in the Big East or ACC, but the 6’10’’ power forward chose the Ivy League—turning down Texas and UCLA along the way—because he didn’t see top-level basketball and an Ivy League diploma as mutually exclusive.
 
"Four years from now, when no one cares who Zena Edosomwan is, I know a lot of opportunities will be there for me to be successful on and off the court,” Edosomwan told Sports Illustrated in 2012. “... If I become successful, people will remember that I took that chance, that I had a higher purpose than basketball.”
 
Carroll concurs, noting that the success of the Ivy League on the NCAA’s biggest stage—the league has posted a 4-5 record in the NCAA Tournament since 2011—has changed the college basketball landscape at NMH.
 
“The shift has already happened--now there is no longer a conversation of you should explore the Ivy League, [and] I don’t have those conversations anymore,” Carroll said. “The kids are already coming to me with those schools on their list and they don’t have to be convinced that the Ivy League is a strong enough basketball conference...these kids are now putting those schools on their list right off the bat.”
 
INTO THE SPOTLIGHT
 
In New Haven, the Crimson walked away with a 70-58 victory to clinch its third straight outright title and an NCAA Tournament bid. All in all, five Ivy League teams made a postseason tournament in 2014, as the league has continued its push for national recognition.  
But people were taking notice of more than just the Ivy League. A year earlier at the Dance, NMH talents were on full display.
 
First it was Rivard, who in 2013 torched third-seeded New Mexico to the tune of 17 points on just nine shots—all of them from behind the arc. The senior never left the court as the 14th-seeded Crimson walked out of the EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City, Utah with the 68-62 upset win over the Lobos.
 
A few weeks later, Albrecht had his moment to shine as Michigan made a run to the final. Averaging a shade above two points per game, he seemed to be the most unlikely of impact players coming into the game. However, the 175-pound guard exited the building with his opponents’ utmost respect.
 
Though Michigan would fall, 82-76, Albrecht’s 4-of-5 mark from downtown and 17 points—and just like Rivard, on nine shots—kept the Wolverines in the game and the guard in the minds of national viewers everywhere.
 
The two games were emblematic of the philosophy for Carroll’s program. NMH didn’t just get its hoops recruits to college; once at college, Carroll’s players were prepared to excel as well.
 
“We want these guys to play on the next court,” Carroll said. “If you are the best player on your playground, you need to find a new playground. If you’re playing in prep school, you need to play like you’re in college. If you’re playing in college, you need play like you’re at the next level.”
 
And as long as Carroll’s recruits continue to buy into their coach’s message, more and more will continue to play at the next level. With the growing number of players prioritizing their education alongside athletics, the trend towards the Ivy League isn’t likely to stop anytime soon.
 
“I think [Ivy League recruiting] is going to continue with the momentum that it has,” Carroll said. “I don’t see any reason why it would slow down. There are just going to be more and more kids who understand the benefits of playing in the Ivy League.”
 
For Brown, Carroll opened his eyes to just that. Playing basketball in the Ancient Eight over a power conference like the Pac-12 no longer entailed making sacrifices. Instead, it was just the opposite.
 
“A place like Harvard you can do it all,” Carroll said. “Big athletic dreams, big social dreams, big academic dreams. I just opened his eyes to what he was looking for.”
 
Brown wasn’t the first NMH player to hear this advice from Carroll, and, the coach says, he certainly won’t be the last.
 “Sometimes they are kids and just need those things pointed out to them, as their focused might have shifted a little bit,” Carroll said. “And with Matt, he was quick to realize that indeed his focus had shifted...he can walk into any office in the world and say he’s a Harvard graduate.”

We may have given up hope on the New England weather months ago, but spring has come back to Boston! Finally, the lawn chairs and life-sized chess pieces we all know and love have returned to campus. But don’t get too excited! Another dreary time will be here soon: finals season.
So, what should you do for the next four weeks? It’s time to have fun, relax, and prepare for the end of the semester.
 
Take a Yoga Class
  With skyrocketing stress levels and Lamont’s transformation into a Hunger Games-style arena (competition over desks and outlets, of course), reading period can be intense.The solution? Yoga at Hemenway and the MAC! Take the next few weeks to de-stress and find inner peace in preparation for exams. And once you’re cooped up in the library, don’t be afraid to bust out a downward facing dog, wherever you are studying. You may look crazy, but at least you’ll be Zen.
Use That Dorm Kitchen
  It’s a place most of us have forgotten exists, but these kitchens are actually one of the best things the houses have to offer. You’ve been eating the same HUDS food all year long – it’s time for a change! So go to the supermarket, grab some fresh ingredients, and make dinner for yourself and your friends! You’ll enjoy spending time together, and your taste buds will surely welcome the change.
 
Go To Office Hours
  Let’s be real, Harvard students know that it’s all about networking. But too many of us forget to talk to our TFs and professors. So spend some time at office hours and get to know them. They’re actually really nice, and they shockingly may even know a thing or two. Just make sure you have plenty of excuses ready for when they ask why you never go to section.
 
Go Shopping
  With finals come formals, and we all need to look our very best! Take a few hours out of your weekend and head to Newbury Street. If you stock up on the essentials now, you’ll be able to avoid running around your entryway the night right before an event looking for shoes or a tie.
 
Get Outside
  The parkas and Bean Boots are disappearing, which means it’s time to venture outside outside and enjoy the weather without losing feeling in your toes. Once reading period starts, you’ll move to Lamont and forget what fresh air and sunlight are. So take advantage now, and spend as much time as possible outside! You’ll be happier, healthier, and you can even start working on that summer tan.
You know you’ll miss this time once reading period starts. So get out there and make the most of it!

Flyby sat down with Michael C. Slovenski ’15, George G. Mills ’15, and Matthew P. Sheets ’15 of Semi-Serious to talk Yardfest, Natasha Bedingfield, and chupacabras. The other two members of the band Liam Cassidy and Andrew Jarowenko are juniors at Tufts. Be sure to catch them on Sunday when they open for Janelle Monáe!
 Flyby: If you could sum up your feelings about Yardfest in one word, what would it be?Matt S: Hyped.Mike S: Apathetic.Matt S: Just hyped. Maybe we could do a list of three words? Hyped, apathetic, and…GM: Terrified. I think that has a very Semi-Serious vibe.Matt S: Because we over-analyze everything.GM: I just close read everything.
 

 
Flyby: How confident were you at Battle of the Bands?Mike S: We were honestly pretty apprehensive about it.Matt S: I was up until like 6 a.m. on a mix of adrenaline, nerves, and redbull.Mike S: We knew it was going to be fun but at the same time it was our first battle.Matt S: You never forget your first battle.GM: It was really cool to see how good all the musicians were. It was a good comment on how the Harvard band scene has grown exponentially since we got here.
Flyby: Will this be the biggest crowd you’ve played for?Matt S: Hopefully. Otherwise some of our friends aren’t as good as we thought.GM: We definitely played a pretty big show in Lowell B-52 but Yardfest should be much bigger.Matt S: I think the battle was the biggest show we’ve played.GM: Yeah, since the Brunswick High School Talent Show I’d say. We should start the hashtag #makeittoyardfest.
Flyby: Will you get to hang with Janelle before the show? After the show?Matt S: George and I are so excited to hear your answer because we don’t know.Mike S: From what I’ve heard, no. There’s no arrangement to my knowledge.GM: It would be sick if she wanted to come on and do a song with us.Mike S: We’re hoping to reach out to her a few hours before our set.GM: Janelle could replace Mike and kick Mike out of the band.
Flyby: How did you get your name?Mike S: Um bandnamesgenerator.com.Matt S: Really?Mike S: Just kidding.GM: There was a lot of contention.Mike S: Not really. We came up with it two years ago and we were just a three man group at that time. We were putting out some demos and we needed a name for ourselves and we came up with it—Matt S: This is a tearjerker.Mike S: We thought about how we felt about the sessions and how we want people to receive them.Matt S: That was nice.
 
Flyby: You mentioned that you were originally a threesome, so how did the full band come together?GM: It was a ménage-a-trois of ideals.Mike S: The threesome was great, but we wanted more. We brought in a bassist because, ya know, you need that.GM: We started actually, Mike and I, and one of our friends from Tufts. We played in high school together in Maine. We came to college and kept playing together but then they were like ‘Hey George, why don’t you learn drums?’ So I did that because I used to play bass.Mike S: We needed a drummer but all we could find was a bassist. So we made George play drums.MS: Is that really what happened?Mike S: Yeah, that’s really what happened. And then I met Matt at the beginning of this year and I was like ‘eh he’s kind of a dick but he’s okay at guitar,’ so we took him on.
 
Flyby: MS, do you want to comment on your entrance to the band?Matt S: I like to think of myself as more bad at guitar than I’m bad at being a person.Flyby: So you’re bad at guitar and good at being a person? Or you’re good at guitar and bad at being a person?Matt S: I don’t want to talk too much about myself as a person.Mike S: I’d say he’s less of a dick and worse of a guitar player. Either way, we’ve got some pretty good things, and some pretty bad things happening.
 
Flyby: Is it difficult to find time to rehearse?Mike S: Yes, yup.Matt S: Partially because two of the guys are at Tufts.Mike S: We have to block out so much time including travel. Then on top of that, every time we add another person’s schedule to the mix things get more complicated. Some of us have jobs, some of us don’t have jobs, but do other things some times. Some of us own recording studios #quadsoundstudios.GM: You make it sound like we’re running a drug cartel on the side.Mike S: Side note, we are not a drug cartel on the side.Matt S: Just comment on our Facebook page and we’ll get back to you. You’ll know the code word.
 
Flyby: What are some bands that influence your style or inspire you?Matt S: Tyga and Das Racist.Mike S: Top four I would list, besides Tyga and Das Racist: Weezer, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jack Johnson, and Natasha Bedingfield.Matt S: These are just bands we play covers of...GM: I would definitely say Natasha Bedingfield would be the fourth. That’s what I model my drumming off of. Completely serious, I only know how to play one beat and I just play it in every song.Mike S: Which is fitting because Natasha Bedingfield doesn’t play the drums.
Flyby: Do you write your own songs or do you do covers? Mike S: We do write our own songs, we actually try to mainly be an originals band.Matt S: Before I joined they were all original. This semester we started playing gigs so we had to fill up the set time with covers. But we’re now trying to go back towards originals more.Mike S: It’s fairly necessary to play covers at college gigs, but we try to stay original as much as possible.Matt S: We just released a single called “This is Grace”. Check it out!GM: We just released an EP and another single two days ago. It’s always fun to go huge on a Natasha Bedingfield song. It’s really cool for us, though, when people know the words to our songs. It’s a cool thing to write an original song and see your friends make out to that song.
Flyby: Imagine they get married and invite you to play at their wedding.Mike S: Yeah, we could recreate that moment for them.Flyby: How do you handle groupies?GM: We’ll tell you when we have some.Mike S: That’s the right answer.
Flyby: What are you fully serious about? Matt S: I think it’s different for different people.Mike S: Inside jokes.GM: Having fun.Matt S: Friendship.GM: I’m going to start crying.Mike S: Definitely not the music.
Flyby: Long time goal of the band:Matt S: Getting the chupacabra on the endangered species list. It’s an animal that lives in Mexico and attacks goats and lambs and sucks their blood at night. The point is that very few people have seen them, which probably means they’re endangered but they’re not on the list.GM: It’s like the sasquatch, but real, but not.Matt S: Oh also our guitarist is looking to sell a Boss loop pedal Alesis synth. He really wanted me to push this.
Flyby: I don’t think anyone will know what that is.MS: It’s fine, don’t worry.Mike S: Let’s do this again soon.MS: We should have a weekly series and it can be called Semi-Weekly Series.
