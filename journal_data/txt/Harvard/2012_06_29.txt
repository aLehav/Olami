After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thursday's historic ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold key clauses of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will likely serve as a rallying point for both campaigns for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts, according to political analysts.
Analysts said the court’s decision to maintain the health care law’s hotly-contested individual mandate could benefit Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, as she seeks to unseat Senator Scott Brown, a Republican, in this fall’s election.
"I think it politically helps any Democrat a little bit, including Elizabeth Warren," Harvard Law School professor Einer R. Elhauge said of the court's decision. "The argument that Obamacare was unconstitutional and overreaching, I think, goes away."
Analysts saw the court's ruling as a significant victory for President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats. With it, they said, comes a much-needed increase in political capital for the nation's left—capital that will likely extend to Warren, a supporter of the administration’s financial reforms and close political ally of the president.
For supporters of Senator Brown, the ruling could serve as a rallying cry in opposition to health care reform and in support of Brown.
"I think it's another stark contrast between Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown," Democratic political consultant Mary Anne Marsh said shortly after the ruling.
With the law two years old and freshly affirmed by the court, Marsh said Brown will struggle to deliver the unified message against reform he was able to galvanize last time around. In 2010, Brown won the open U.S. Senate seat of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy '52-'54, one of the Senate’s foremost health care reform advocates.
"Scott Brown ran as the 41st vote against health care in the special election last time," Marsh said. "I don't think people will view that as well in 2012 as they did in 2010."
Still, Republican political consultant Todd Domke said he expects Brown will give significant attention to the issue in the coming months.
"Brown will use it to motivate his base, especially in fundraising with out-of-state conservatives," Domke wrote in an email. "[He] might be reluctant to make it a major point of attack. He doesn't want to seem too close to Romney on this issue since that would play into Warren's strategy of trying to depict him as just another Republican. But Brown realizes that he won this seat in the first place partly because of the unpopularity of Obamacare."
Brown released a statement opposing the ruling shortly after it was announced Thursday. He called the bill unaffordable and unwanted legislation.
"The federal health care law may be constitutional, but it is wrong for jobs and the economy. In Massachusetts, we had already dealt responsibly with the problem of our uninsured," Brown said. "All we got out of this massive new federal entitlement is higher taxes, cuts in Medicare, and additional debt at a time when we can least afford it."
What in other states is a straightforward boon for Democrats, is complicated by Massachusetts unusual history with health care reform, analysts said. Massachusetts was the first state to enact health care reform. It did so before the federal government, and under the leadership of now-Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney. Then state-senator Brown was also in support of the reform.
Later in the day, Brown's campaign directed its criticism at Warren.
"Warren's single-payer, European-style, government-owned and operated health care scheme will make Obamacare look tame by comparison," Brown's campaign manager Jim Barnett wrote, implying a vote for Warren would only worsen an already bad situation.
The Warren camp lauded the court's decision in an email to supporters Thursday afternoon, calling the ruling a "great relief."
“This decision ensures that millions of children, seniors, and families will continue to benefit from health care reform,” Warren said. “By upholding this legislation, the Supreme Court has ensured that every American can get access to high quality, affordable health care and fair treatment from insurance companies."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of increased awareness of the dangers of head trauma in sports, the Ivy League and Big Ten Conferences will partner in research on concussions and other head injuries in collegiate athletics. The co-sponsored project will pool over two years of research by each conference with the hopes of better understanding the effects of possible injuries and exploring preventative measures.
Robin Harris, Executive Director of the Ivy League, said that the partnership is a “wonderful opportunity to combine the expertise and research prowess of 20 of the best universities in the country.”
This collaboration has come after roughly two years of major research from each individual conference.
“Both the Big Ten and the Ivy League have been at the forefront of looking at this issue both athletically and from a research perspective,” said Kerry Kenny, Assistant Director of Compliance for The Big Ten.
In the past several seasons, the two Division I conferences have been among the first to make changes designed to protect its student-athletes from head injury. In 2010, the Big Ten created a conference-wide concussion management plan, the first of its kind among collegiate conferences. The following season, after a year-long review process, the Ivy League created and implemented new practice regulations for football, though Harvard players at the time said that the rules were no different than Harvard’s self-imposed restrictions.
Discussions about the possibility of collaboration between the two athletic conferences began in September, 2011.
Dan Colleran, an Assistant Executive Director for the Ivy League, said that the project involves many individuals working together across two conferences, and the scope of the investigation could lead to logistical difficulties.
“It is hard to work together just across one institution, so working across twenty is certainly more complicated, but the payoff is just tremendous,” added Barbara S. McFadden Allen, Executive Director of the Big Ten Committee on Institutional Cooperation.
Sally Mason, Big Ten Council of Presidents and Chancellors Chair and the President of University of Iowa, told the press that the collaboration will reinforce “the priorities of institutional research and research and reciprocity between some the nation’s top academic organizations.”
“The Ivy League is committed to fostering a safe and healthy environment for our student-athletes,” Shirley M. Tilghman, Ivy League Council of Presidents and President of Princeton University, said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the Big Ten to continue to study the effects of concussions and head injuries in sport."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After posting impressive times in the 200-meter butterfly this morning, two Harvard athletes, Kate Mills ’11 and Courtney Otto ’15, advanced to the semifinals, which will be held tonight at the US Olympic Trials in Omaha, Neb.
Otto, who was born in 1993, won her heat in a time of 2:12.22, just 3.44 seconds behind top qualifier Kim Vandenberg, born a whole decade earlier in 1983. Mills raced in the same heat as Vandenberg, heat number 12, finishing in 2:11.68. 10 of the 16 semifinalists came from either heat 12 or heat 14, including the top four qualifiers.
Otto, who qualified 11th and will be swimming in semifinal number two this evening, has had an impressive showing at the trials this week. On Tuesday, she finished 28th in the 400-meter individual medley, and on Wednesday, she finished 22nd in the 200 Individual Medley.
Mills will be racing in lane six in the first semifinal. Both races can be watched live on NBC sports or online at NBC Live Extra at 8 PM ET tonight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
OMAHA—Courtney Otto turned spectators’ heads as she cruised to a first-place finish in the tenth of fourteen morning preliminary heats of the women’s 200-meter butterfly. Her time of 2 minutes, 12.22 seconds, seemed too fast for such a lowly-seeded heat.
But the rising Harvard sophomore was just getting warmed up. Advancing past the prelims, Otto swam even faster (2:11.35) to place ninth in the semifinals of the women’s 200-meter butterfly on day four of the U.S. Swimming Olympic Trials in Omaha, Neb., Thursday evening, missing a spot in the final heat by .35 seconds.
Crimson women’s head coach Stephanie Morawski was pleased with Otto’s performance.
“For her first semifinal at Olympic Trials, she handled the pressure extremely well,” Morawski said. “She didn’t let anything faze her. She went out there, and she attacked.”
Heading into the preliminary heats, Otto was seeded 48th in a field of 135 swimmers. But the rising sophomore rocketed up the rankings with a pair of personal-best times. In the morning, Otto cut 1.9 seconds from her previous best time to secure the 11th seed for the semifinals. At night, she bested her morning swim by .87 of a second to place ninth.
“I just tried to enjoy the experience and live in the moment, I guess,” said Otto, who represented Harvard at the NCAA Championships earlier this year and holds the school standard in the 400-yard individual medley.
Schulkin, Otto’s training partner, was not surprised by Otto’s result. “Swimming with her every day, I knew it was coming,” Schulkin said. “She’s been training really fast in practice.”
Despite a low seed entering the meet, a top-16 finish was Otto’s goal as she mounted the starting block Thursday morning.
“She loves to race, and it wasn’t really a matter of dropping time and moving up places,” Morawski said. “She just had to get in there and do what she does best: race.”
Otto showed quick opening speed in both her morning and evening swims, turning in two of the fastest first 50-meter splits of the field. In the semifinal, Otto found an extra gear during the third 50 meters of her race.
“This morning, I was a little tired for some reason, so I felt like I had a little more in me coming into tonight,” Otto said. “I didn’t feel any extreme nerves. I just felt relaxed and ready to swim.”
Otto’s ninth-place finish is the second-highest by a Harvard woman at the Olympic Trials during Morawski’s 15-year tenure with the team. Eight years ago, Noelle Bassi '07 also excelled in the 200 butterfly at the 2004 Trials in Long Beach, Cal., where she placed sixth in her bid for the Olympic team.
Otto now looks ahead to the U.S. Open later this summer in Indianapolis. There, Otto hopes to qualify for the 2013 World University Games in Kazan, Russia, with a top-two finish among American collegiate competitors.
“It’s still kind of a long-shot, but it’s definitely a good goal to work towards,” Otto said.
Day Four of the Trials was a banner day for Harvard, as five Crimson swimmers—Otto, Kate Mills '11, junior Dani Schulkin, Hilary Roberts '12 and rising freshman Connie Hsu—competed in the women’s 200 butterfly.
Mills, who currently hold Harvard's school record in the 200-yard-butterfly, also qualified for the top-16 semifinal round, placing 13th with a time of 2:12.11.
Schulkin and Hsu, who swam with Otto in the same preliminary heat, finished 111th and 115th, respectively. Roberts placed 104th in her final race as a Harvard swimmer.
In other races Thursday, Harvard sprinters junior Oliver Lee, sophomore Griffin Schumacher, and junior Christopher Satterthwaite competed in the men’s 100 freestyle, finishing 49th, 85th and 118th, respectively. In the men’s 200 breaststroke, junior Chuck Katis placed 45th.

June 29, 1959: Many Gay Social Events Highlight Summer Planning
The about 3,850 students attending the Summer School in 1959 will be socially treated to all the benefits of a three ring circus and some of the exclusivity of Mrs. Vanderbilt's legendary "400."
Basically, three weekly events will serve to promote friendship among the students. Normally, the social week will be kicked off by a Square Dance at the Harvard Union on Tuesday evening, with the well-known caller Herb Gaudreau calling the sets.
This Tuesday, however, the famed Schneider's Band will serenade the happy few from the steps of Widener Library—on the Tuesdays following, through August 4, the Union will bow to the music and dancing of the Westland.

It's 1:30 in the morning, and you're hungry. But where do you go? It is a divisive debate among the Harvard student body, and loyalties to the Square's late-night stops run deep. Over an 11 day period, The Crimson will debate 11 popular choices around campus. Now up: Au Bon Pain.
The first thing any Harvard freshman learns is to never refer to the Hong Kong or Pinnochio’s Pizza by their full names. Those who are “in the know,” the freshmen learn, call them “the Kong” and “Noch’s,” respectively.
But what those freshmen don’t learn is that those who are truly in the know don’t go to either of those places—they go to Au Bon Pain, the best late night eatery in the square.
Some will take issue with this judgment. Some will label it sacrilegious. These people simply don’t realize the most essential element of any late night food establishment: variety. When it’s one in the morning, you’re not in the mood to be told what to eat. You’ve had a great night, and you’re ready to assert your freedom of choice. ABP presents you with that choice, with offerings from croissants to soups to Greek salads.
The variety is equally important if you’re out on the town with friends. Arguing over where to eat can end in one of two ways: a vicious, embittered debate that ends with nothing but resentment, or a calm, reasoned discussion that resolves itself only when one or two restaurants remain open. ABP, with its near-limitless range of options, allows you to circumvent that unfortunate obstacle.
The only place that comes close to ABP’s level of choice and variety is CVS. But if you buy anything other than a stale bag of chips at this so-called value store, odds are that the meal is going to necessitate some level of preparation. In the middle of a Saturday night, operating cooking equipment isn’t always the best idea.
ABP’s delicious meals, thankfully, don’t require any further work. In terms of convenience and variety, it’s the best place in the Square after midnight.

It's 1:30 in the morning, and you're hungry. But where do you go? It is a divisive debate among the Harvard student body, and loyalties to the Square's late-night stops run deep. Over an 11 day period, The Crimson will debate 11 popular choices around campus. Now up: Falafel Corner.
Some people may have come to you recently with claims that they know where the best place for a late-night bite is. Some people may have tried to back up these claims with “facts” and “arguments” and “rationale”. Truth be told (for the first time in this series), these people are wrong.  It’s nothing against them or their stupid, wrong opinions, it’s just cold, hard objectivity: Falafel Corner is the only correct choice for twilight fare. If you’ll allow me to be Frank for a moment, I’ll explain.
“Frank, are you implying that those other restaurants suggested by your colleagues are no good?” you ask.
Not at all. I’m just implying that when one levels a critical eye upon them, they fall short of the benchmark set by the bastion of convenient cuisine that is Falafel Corner. I’m a reasonable man. I understand that other establishments serve food in exchange for money, and that it’s probably important for the economy or something. But while those establishments and the mere peons that frequent them may have a place in the world, I am simply suggesting that perhaps we deserve a slightly nicer place.
I mean, if you enjoy the thrill of pitting your appetite in a heated race against the latest rapidly expanding plaque in your arteriosclerotic life, then by all means pay a visit to Domino's or Pizza Ring. If you yearn for the rush of conformity and the dull drone of monotony, then maybe you would indeed be better served at the Kong or Noch’s. If you genuinely hate yourself and wish to be unhappy, well, IHOP is right down the street from where I’m headed.
Now, I’ve heard some “people” complain that Falafel Corner is too far removed from their daily routes to be a viable option. I generally don’t care to respond, because what dialogue can be had between such charlatans and true gentlemen? If a few extra steps are enough to separate you from happiness, then put bluntly, you don’t deserve happiness; you deserve Quincy Grille.
The magical sounding (and tasting) 8½ Eliot St. has everything the human body needs: 100 percent of your daily dietary Vitamin Shawarma, a bit of Mineral Falafel, and a Baba Ghanouj supplement that goes down so smooth you’ll tell those One-A-Days that they’re Done-Today.
Oh, and this culinary epic you’ve run into headlong like a certain parentally challenged, magical teen at platform eight-and-a-half doesn’t just end there. Like any satisfying story, there is an epilogue, and it is sweet. A basboussa that you’ll devour before you can worry whether or not you have the pronunciation correct. Cashew fingers that’ll leave you licking yours until the sun rises. Their baklawa? More like bak-love-of-my-life. All perfect denouements to a rich, rewarding tale of heroics and Middle-Eastern gastronomics.
Look, I’m not telling you everyone else has been wrong thus far; I’m just telling you that I’m much more right. When I find myself hungry and in need of spiritual direction, it will always be Falafel Corner guiding me through the night.
