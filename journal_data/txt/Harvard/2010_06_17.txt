After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department continues to await an independent committee report intended to offer "lessons learned" for the city in the aftermath of the controversial arrest of Professor Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr. and subsequent allegations of racial bias.
 
 
Formed last September, the Cambridge Review Committee was tasked with preparing a set of recommendations that would address the issues that arose from Gates' July 16 arrest, which had sparked accusations against the CPD of racial bias.
In a  March 1 “progress  report,” the committee stated that final recommendations would be  released in late  spring, and the Cambridge Chronicle reported last week that the recommendations would  be submitted to the city this week.
But no release date has been set for the report, according to Committee member  Aaron D. Miller. CPD spokesman Daniel M. Riviello similarly stated that the CPD did not know of a set deadline for the report, and added that Police Commissioner Robert C. Haas has not reviewed the final report, nor has it been submitted to the department.
 
John  Kosko, a retired school administrator and member of the  committee, said he did not know when the report will be made publicly  available, but added that the committee had “absolutely” fulfilled  its mission.
“I  think the committee did its best to address the concerns that  were raised and the charge it was given by the commissioner and the city  manager,” he said.
Other  committee members and a spokeswoman for the city manager’s  office could not be reached for comment.
While  the recommendations of Cambridge Review Committee—a group  of 12 members hailing from various distinguished backgrounds—are  unknown, the March progress report issued by the committee said that it  has “focused on topics such as police authority, conflict intervention,  the role of the community to work with their neighbors and the police to  ensure their own public safety, as well as strengthening a sense of  trust between law enforcement and the residents of Cambridge.”
The  progress report made no explicit mention of  addressing racial bias, an accusation lobbed at the CPD in the aftermath  of Gates' arrest. Kosko said that addressing racial prejudice was not  “one of  the issues the committee was charged with” but added that it was a  "byproduct of the response to the incident.”
Meanwhile, a New England Center for  Investigative Reporting  analysis found that the racial breakdown of those arrested for  disorderly conduct mirrored the racial composition of Cambridge, The  Boston Globe reported today. The CPD also released the summary of an  analysis it conducted with regard to disorderly conduct arrests, which  said that black and white offenders faced similar arrest rates  regardless of the arresting officer’s race.
Returning  from China last July, Gates was arrested for disorderly  conduct at his home when passer-by Lucia Whalen called police to report a  possible break-in. A police report said that Gates was exhibiting  “tumultuous behavior” and accusing the police officer, Sgt. James  Crowley, of prejudice, while an account of the events written on behalf  of Gates in the African-American culture magazine “The Root” said he was  arrested after following Crowley outside and asking for his name and  badge number.
Gates’ colleagues at Harvard sharply  chided the actions of  Crowley, citing racial profiling in Gates’ arrest. Evelyn B.  Higginbotham, chair of the Department of African and African American  Studies, wrote in an open letter that “to be black in America brings painful situations such as what  you are now experiencing.” Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 called  the  arrest “troubling.”
On July 21, charges were dropped against Gates, but a day later, the incident reached its pinnacle of  media attention when President Barack Obama said the Cambridge Police  Department “acted stupidly,” adding that racial profiling remained a fact of life for minorities  in America. He later distanced himself from his comments, saying that he blundered in his “choice of words,”  and invited Crowley and Gates to the White House for conversation and  beer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week ago, Harvard men’s lacrosse coach John Tillman would have found it hard to imagine himself coaching anywhere else.
But after a quick turn of events, it was announced Wednesday afternoon that Tillman was resigning as the Frisbie Family Head Coach for Harvard Men’s Lacrosse to take the head coaching position at the University of Maryland.
“I kind of saw myself [at Harvard] for as long as Harvard would want me,” said Tillman, whose team finished the 2009 season ranked 17th in the nation. “I didn’t really think that I would be leaving…I am still kind of taken aback.”
Events began to unfold earlier this week when Maryland officials contacted Tillman while he was on the road making preparations for the 2011 Ivy League season. After going through Nichols Family Director of Athletics Bob Scalise, the Maryland officials were granted permission to speak with Tillman.
When it came down to it, it was factors outside of lacrosse that made the Maryland job appealing to the three-year Crimson head coach.
“Being closer to my family was a huge, huge factor for me,” said Tillman, who lived in Maryland for 12 years while serving as the top assistant at Navy. “I think the one thing that I want people to realize was that this was not about, ‘I want to coach at Maryland more than I want to coach at Harvard.’ When jobs come up, you do weigh a lot of factors. It comes down to things that are important to me at this point in my life.”
But even with his familial connections, making the decision to leave the Crimson was a difficult one for Tillman, who had grown emotionally connected to the players he had recruited and coached for the past three seasons and other faculty and staff at the university.
“Harvard is just an unbelievable place,” Tillman said. “I really did not sleep well for four or five days because I did really fall in love with Harvard…My biggest disappointment is not being able to spend as much time with the players and the incoming players.”
But when it came down to it, the opportunity to move closer to family was too much to resist.
Now Tillman takes over a strong ACC program that suffered just four defeats in the 2010 season and made it to the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.
Unlike in 2008 when Tillman took over for a struggling Crimson team that finished the previous season 5-7, the coach will now already have many of the pieces in place to make another NCAA tournament run, as the Terrapins return 82 percent of their scoring.
In his three years as the Harvard coach, Tillman guided the Crimson to a 20-19 overall record, which included upset wins over Duke in 2009 and Princeton in 2010.
But more importantly, Tillman laid the groundwork for the future success of the Harvard lacrosse program, bringing in the third-ranked recruiting class in the nation for the 2010 campaign.
“It was important for me to lay that foundation,” Tillman said. “The future of this program is so bright.” 
“We thank coach Tillman for the wonderful job he did developing our players and our program and leaving us in position for continued success,” Scalise said to gocrimson.com. “The effect of coach Tillman’s time in Cambridge will be long-lasting and we will always consider him a true friend of Harvard men’s lacrosse.  We will find a replacement to build from the momentum created by coach Tillman’s tenure.”

In light of the recent phishing schemes that have plagued FAS e-mail addresses, FAS IT issued a cautionary announcement last Thursday: "Please be aware that an FAS IT employee will never ask for your account password, whether over the phone or by e-mail. To do so would violate University security policy."
Though the increase in reports of phishing schemes—messages that claim authenticity and ask for confidential information—doesn't mean there's a security breach, we asked Noah S. Selsby '95, senior client technology advisor for FAS IT, to give us some tips on preventing harm from these privacy-invading scams. Here's what he told us:
1. Never click any links or open any attachments that seem suspicious or you did not request.
2. Never respond to a suspicious e-mail asking for private information.
3. If you are unsure about an e-mail, you can check its authenticity by calling the FAS IT help line at 617-495-9000 or e-mailing help@fas.harvard.edu.
4. Continue to report these scams to FAS IT so they can make announcements if they are seeing particularly high traffic.
Selsby said that if you've already responded to a phishing scam e-mail, you should immediately contact the institution that manages the account for which you provided the personal information.
