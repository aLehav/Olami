After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Well-beloved American actor Paul Rudd recently celebrated his 50th birthday, yet he’s still looking young as ever with his youthful green eyes and full, wavy brown hair. Paul “The Stud” Rudd has been starring in major films since the 1990s, starting with his role as heartthrob Josh in “Clueless” (1995) up to the highly-anticipated finale of the Avengers films, “Avengers: Endgame” (2019).
Paul Rudd probably has his name somewhere in almost everyone’s favorite comedies, given that he’s played parts in at least 61 feature films and 34 television series. Some of the highlights include “Wet Hot American Summer” (2001), “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” (2004), “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” (2005), “Knocked Up” (2007), “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” (2008), “I Love You, Man” (2009), and “Dinner for Shmucks” (2010). Arguably, he also deserves credit for bringing humor to the Marvel Universe with his role as Ant-Man.
His numerous television appearances, too, garner some recognition. He played recurring roles of Phoebe’s love interest, Mike, in the show “Friends,” and of businessman Bobby Newport in “Parks and Recreation.”
Several of the films that Rudd has worked in came out with sequels, such as “Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues” (2013), or the “Wet Hot American Summer” Netflix reboot starring original cast members Bradley Cooper and Amy Poehler. Perhaps these shows were so successful that they implored another edition — or maybe people just wanted to see some more Paul Rudd action on screen.
Rudd’s achievements don’t just begin and end with his acting career, though. He is also involved in philanthropic work. He began supporting the Stuttering Association for the Young (SAY) after portraying a character with a stutter back in 2006, in a play entitled “Three Days of Rain.” Additionally, because of Rudd’s unique connection to his home state, Kansas, he founded The Big Slick, an annual charity event that many celebrities attend whose mission is to support the Kansas City Children’s Mercy Hospital.
The most memorable and arguably impressive work in Rudd’s career might actually be his role as Hollywood’s resident meme-guy, most notably from Comic Con in 2014. Before the release of the first Ant-Man movie, and thus before fellow Avengers’ star Mark Ruffalo had the chance to meet him, Paul Rudd was being interviewed. As the cameras are rolling, Ruffalo walks through the background, awestruck to be in the presence of Rudd’s greatness. He mouths with an astonished look, “Is that Paul Rudd?” and then slowly slinks away in a stupefied gaze. This 15-second clip spread through the Internet masses like wildfire, becoming a fully-fledged meme.
But Paul Rudd is a comedian of sequels. At the 2018 World Premiere of “Avengers: Infinity War,” as Mark Ruffalo was speaking in an interview, Rudd walks through the back mouthing, “Oh my god, is that Mark Ruffalo?” bringing he meme full circle.
Beyond Paul Rudd’s comedic personality, people might attribute him with being “Mr. Perfect.” Rudd often receives comments on his genuineness and sincerity. In an interview with Elle Magazine, he said, “I just think life is so hard. There are so many things that can get you down – that are so frustrating and so maddening. As cornball as it sounds, kindness is a thing that can defuse it a little bit. Kindness and laughs.”
So happy 50th birthday, Paul! Thanks for the many years of laughs and internet sensations, and here’s to many more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leonardo da Vinci continues to be hailed as one of the greatest artists of all time. So when art historians announced that they had discovered and verified another one of his paintings, the art world paid attention. Leonardo’s so-called “lost masterpiece,” “Salvator Mundi” — Latin for "Saviour of the World" — was authenticated in May 2008. If this was over a decade ago, why are we still talking about it today?
Because its current holders are mysteriously refusing to exhibit the work.
In Nov. 2017, the work sold from Christie’s auction house by a mystery buyer who was willing to pay a record $450.3 million. The buyer was later identified as a Saudi prince, Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, who intended to gift the piece to the Louvre Abu Dhabi.
Its unveiling was scheduled for Sept. 2018, and art lovers waited with bated breath. But at the start of the month, the unveiling was suddenly postponed. Now, seven months later, the work is still shrouded in mystery. Neither the Louvre in Paris nor the staff at the Louvre Abu Dhabi have knowledge of its whereabouts. What the hell happened to the “Salvator Mundi”?
Before the piece was verified as a da Vinci, it seemed to be just another depiction of Jesus in Renaissance dress. Its most special feature is not its representation, but its speculated history: It is thought to be a contemporary of “The Last Supper” and the last painting privately held by da Vinci himself. After it was declared the work of a Big Name Artist, the intrigue inevitably skyrocketed. But what ultimately gave it such immense value was Prince Mohammed’s offering price.This buying price dubbed “Salvator Mundi” the most expensive work ever to be sold at an auction.
Now, this strange refusal to show this work is causing conjecture. Because it was never made explicitly clear how Abu Dhabi had acquired this piece from the Saudi’s, some speculate that Prince Mohammed is keeping the work for his personal collection. Others are reviving doubts of the work’s authenticity, saying a public exhibition may result in unwanted scrutiny.
Why are we still so adamantly curious? The New York Times, The Guardian, and more have covered this painting and its aftermath. It now seems that the drama surrounding this infamous painting has created a whole new work of art larger than the “Salvator Mundi” itself. The attention has grossly inflated its value: the more we discuss the work, the more curious we are, until it becomes a shining ball of artistic enlightenment.
Yet when we step away from the articles and chatter, the piece remains a typical Renaissance depiction of Jesus. What we’re left with is a strange realization that the art world ultimately determines the value of artwork. As much as we might hate to acknowledge, works of art sometimes do not have inherent worth; they can become valuable through their presumed value, based on offers from private individuals and the conversation that surrounds them.
The “Salvator Mundi” continues to be a mystery and will continue to draw curiosity as long as it remains hidden. Hope for the unveiling of the painting is beginning to dwindle; the public must simply find solace in speculative, sensational media portrayals. But perhaps, sadly, the mystery is more dazzling anyway.
