After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several things come to mind when thinking of guilty pleasures. Cookies from the dining hall or Netflix on a weeknight are obvious guilty pleasures, but while I shouldn’t eat too many cookies or watch too much Netflix, I’m pretty vocal about my love for both. My true guilty pleasure is far more secret: I love reading tabloids.
Tabloids are my guilty pleasure because I could be doing so much more with my time. Studying is one perfect example. Perhaps I could call my family instead. I could even read news of substance and actually educate myself on important things happening around the world. Yet I choose to read tabloids, and perhaps by the end of my argument, you will too.
Why tabloids? It’s a question I often ask myself as I read them. As a person who almost exclusively reads classic novels and obsesses over classical music, it seems abnormal for me. But that’s precisely why I need tabloids. Reading the latest gossip, whether it’s true or not, helps me lose some of the stress that’s keeping me up at night. I don’t want to have to think, and tabloids let me avoid that, filling my mind with inane information that I’ll never have to remember or ponder. When you spend all your time trying to understand why your computer code doesn’t work, memorizing 10 different chemical mechanisms, or reading archaic literature that while beautiful and full of meaning is also incomprehensible to the tired student, you start to go a little crazy after a while. Reading about people who are perhaps even crazier is a reminder that you’re not the worst off—and also a reminder to chill for just a moment.
Take the Brangelina divorce. Tabloids immediately took hold of that initial true fact and immediately blew it up. And while it’s not really something that affects me, as I struggled with studying for that scary Chem 17 midterm, it was comforting to me that I could catch up on the hilarious theories of Brad Pitt’s infidelity or Jennifer Aniston’s supposed happiness.
There’s no real evidence that tabloids can actually help with stress. All I can do is speak from experience, and tabloids definitely serve a real purpose in helping me temporarily forget whatever burdens I’m carrying around. After all, when you spend all your time in the search for veritas, isn’t it nice to read some gossip and lies for once?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard dining services workers’ historic strike will continue into the weekend and additional dining halls will close for the time being, according to emails sent from Faculty Deans and Unviersity Dining services.
“I have just received an update from HUDS indicating that the work stoppage seems likely to continue into tomorrow and perhaps a couple of days longer, while negotiations continue,” wrote Pforzheimer Faculty Dean Anne Harrington, who is also a History of Science professor, Friday afternoon. 
According to an email from Harvard University Dining Services, open dining halls this weekend include: Eliot House, Kirkland House, Dunster House, Quincy House, Currier House, Winthrop House, and Annenberg. Freshmen will not be able to eat in the Houses over the weekend.
As workers picketed across Harvard’s campuses on the third day of their strike, representatives from their Boston-based union UNITE HERE Local 26 continued contract talks with the University’s negotiation team. Friday’s session marks the 21st time the two sides have formally come together to bargain since mid-June, when contract negotiations began; they last met Thursday. The prolonged dispute centers on the workers’ wages and health benefits.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga said the contract talks ended without settlement Friday, and another negotiations session is scheduled for Saturday.
According to Harrington, Pforzheimer House’s dining hall will be closed over the weekend, potentially until Monday. All students residing in the Radcliffe Quadrangle will be asked to eat in the Currier dining halls, or in select River houses starting Saturday morning.
Additionally, Harvard will add $25 worth of Board Plus to all student accounts to use in House grill locations, Lamont Library Cafe, and Cambridge Queens Head Pub, Harrington and several other Faculty Deans wrote in similar emails to their Houses.
In their third day of a historic strike — the first the workers have undertaken in more than 30 years — picketers spent most of the day around Harvard Yard and Memorial Hall. Towards midday, the workers congregated under the science center plaza tent for a dance party.
The Association of Black Harvard Women bought donuts for the HUDS workers earlier today. Additionally, students from the Harvard Law School purchased 24 boxes of pizza for the workers in the afternoon, according to Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck.

This weekend is Columbus day weekend, and while your family is going on an annual apple picking day trip, we’ve reached the point in the semester where you instead are likely living the life of a Lamonster.  Fortunately, Flyby is here to tell with tips about how to take advantage of this weekend.
Dress the Part
As you scroll through your Instagram newsfeed, you’ll spot ample fall sweaters, boots, and maybe corduroys, all of which you may or may not need to add to your wardrobe. Consider taking a trip to see the fall clothing sales on Newbury and Boylston. There you’ll not only find the best 2016 fall styles, but also at the best prices of the season.
Embrace the Fall Foliage  
Your family doesn’t have to be the only ones connecting with nature this Columbus day weekend. Contrary to popular belief, city dwellers have ample access to farms and fall foliage. Rent a Zipcar with your roommates and choose from about five farms within a 20-mile radius of campus. This is surely to be a more “authentic” farm animal experience than the caged animals in front of the Science Center each Tuesday.
Engage with the Boston Community
Each year on Columbus Day nearly every city or town in some way or another hosts a Columbus Day Parade. Boston’s parade happens to be one of the best in the country, filled with various bands and forms of entertainment, military and political personal, vintage cars, and, most importantly, Duck Boat Floats. Come hungry, as the parade also celebrates Boston’s Italian heritage. It is important to note that the parade is on Sunday, not on Columbus Day itself because naturally the Columbus Day Parade should be the day before Columbus Day.
