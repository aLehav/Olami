If history class was always too boring, try giving this a shot: “The Dollop” is a history podcast created by Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds, in which Anthony explains a particularly “wacky” historical tale to Reynolds, who comments throughout. Both hosts are standup comedians and TV writers by trade: Anthony wrote for the television show “Arrested Development” and Reynolds has written for TBS’ “Sullivan and Son.”
The pair seem to be good friends and play off each other’s humor. Their appeal is obvious. However, the setup of the podcast itself has problems. In the episode “Big John and Harvey’s Casino,” the first 12 minutes are chock full of banter, scheduling logistics, and advertisements. It’s a discouraging way to listen to something for the first time, and the impulse is to click off the podcast, or at least to press the 15-second fast-forward button again (and again…and again). They also promote themselves in the first several minutes, instead of waiting until the end. When a podcast does the latter, it’s able to target just the listeners who are actually interested in tracking the host’s work. The deluge of information right at the beginning, however, means that a listener either has to put up with 10 or more minutes without interesting content or hunt for when the podcast really starts. It may not seem like a big deal, but first impressions are important, and “The Dollop” doesn’t start off on the right foot.
The ads themselves are full of pauses and take a while to get to the product they are selling. They are full of tangents and anecdotes, which are mildly entertaining and would have been easier to swallow if the podcast were just the two bantering. But because “The Dollop” has an angle—to share a story from history—the commercials drag on too long.
The main content, the actual history itself, is well-done and thoroughly researched. Both hosts get an equal amount of time to shine, and the storytelling is relatively tangent-free. Their dynamic works well because they don’t battle for time or space. Anthony is the history buff, while Reynolds gets to laugh and react along with the audience. The concept is a good one. In many podcasts hosted by a pair, both people explain the event, and therefore both of them have to feign surprise at plot points they already knew were coming. On “The Dollop,” though, Reynolds’s reactions are real and unforced, which makes the comedy even funnier. As a standup comedian, his ability to think on his feet is put to good use.
Where the podcast truly shines, though, is in the moments where Anthony and Reynolds improvise. They pretend to take on the roles of different people in their story, acting out what they imagine happened. They bring light to stories that could potentially lean toward the somber, and their interpretations help distinguish the show from the (many) other history and true crime podcasts. In fact, “The Dollop” is remarkably similar to the podcast “My Favorite Murder” with Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, which has almost exactly the same setup. The biggest difference between the two is that “My Favorite Murder” is true crime, while “The Dollop” is about strange historical events. Fans of one will probably enjoy the other.
This podcast requires your attention. It isn’t because the subjects are so complex, but because the hosts are constantly getting sidetracked or slipping into advertisements without warning. If you can stay focused and enjoy their banter, there are over 300 episodes for you to binge. It’s a fun ride, and their storytelling abilities work well with their comedic timing and lightheartedness. Between the tale of a cartoonist who pretended to survive in the woods, and a sea captain so brutal that he gave his men dysentery, the podcast is guaranteed to entertain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometime around when Chloe Kim won a gold medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics, I showed a friend of mine a YouTube channel. While waiting for the shuttle, he watched a series of assorted marbles skate, skip, and zoom through elaborately planned racetracks filled with bends, gates, and other obstacles meant to slow down literal balls of glass.
“What is this sport?” he asked.
“You just called it a sport,” another friend said.
This is marble racing. It was constructed by Jelle Bakker, who runs a Netherlands-based YouTube channel called “Jelle’s Marble Runs.” The name is pretty self-explanatory: Bakker makes marbles compete against each other. He creates tracks in different terrains for them to compete across. They might be battling it off in self-contained plastic contraptions. Or they might be racing through paths that Bakker has dug into sand. No matter what the field, there is one thing for certain: Aside from the laws dictated by physics, these races are entirely random.
Which makes sense because the competitors are marbles. There is no way for them to prepare for these races—which last for just a few minutes—because they are inanimate objects. You can complain in the comments section, and you can call the game rigged. At the end of the day, you are still getting angry at marbles, which might actually be the most compelling aspect of marble racing.
I was first introduced to marble racing sometime during finals week last semester. I immediately got attached to one cerulean-colored marble named Comet, and found myself quietly cheering it on as it zipped its way through the field. I can’t blame this reaction on my sleep-deprivation-induced haze because in all honesty, whenever I see Jelle’s Marble Runs, I still find myself adamantly rooting for Comet.
This is probably because Bakker puts in an awe-inspiring amount of effort and energy into constructing these races. According to his website, Bakker has autism, and marble racing became his childhood passion as he hunted for track parts in toy stores and thrift shops. Now, he is the mastermind behind marble racing contraptions of amusement-park proportions. “It remains fascinating to see how the marbles make their way through the project,” Bakker’s website, roughly translated by Google from Dutch, says. “Especially the noise that the marbles make when they roll over different types of tracks (rails, vacuum cleaner hoses, tubes) and collide with objects such as bells, gongs, woodblocks, nails, etc.” Greg Woods is the announcer to these marble races, providing commentary in the voiceovers with vigilance.
Regardless of whether or not you scoff at the concept or are one of Bakker’s 399,000 subscribers, marble racing is a testament to what people are capable of—a validation of people’s passions, no matter how obscure. It’s refreshing to see someone put in so much time and care to something that probably brings hundreds of thousands of people some simple joy, a brief moment of unity in the comments section. The 2018 Winter Olympics may be over, but marble racing goes on year-round.

Once upon a time, free dogs roamed Japan before “a procession of dog-hating thugs” of the Kobayashi Dynasty begot modern-day powerless house pets. In Wes Anderson’s new film, “Isle of Dogs,” Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura), a villain sprung from the pages of a comic book, embraces the demagoguery that is his namesake with an extermination program that involves wasabi-poison and robo-dogs. With a star-studded cast voicing the band of rag-tag abandoned dogs around which the plot circles, Anderson imagines their epic with a gravity and generosity of spirit that all canines deserve. He bestows them with fine, scruffy fur and glassy eyes that bulge with a characteristically canine, reliably heartrending sincerity, and enlivens them through stop-motion animation. In the fictional Megasaki, Kobayashi banishes all dogs to the nearby Trash Island. His ward and distant nephew, 12-year-old Atari (Koyu Rankin), flies to Trash Island in search of his best friend and guard dog, Spots. What ensues is no gallivanting adventure, but a crusade against impending genocide. While Anderson indulges many touching expositions of canine character, he deals too summarily with Kobayashi’s sudden character reversal, which conveniently catalyzes a flurry of heroic displays for the story’s tidy resolution. Despite the film’s redemptive magical marvels, Anderson falters in a minor oversight: By portraying Mayor Kobayashi as so unambiguously diabolical, his character reversal, precipitated in a single pivotal moment, becomes a bewildering plot device.
The parchment on which the tale blossoms crackles with plenty of charming, on-the-nose jokes. Mayor Kobayashi sports a huge, florid tattoo of a cat on his back. Despite speaking in Japanese without English subtitles, Atari’s fearless and adamant kindness toward his canine allies translates easily into emotional maturity and silent strength, and he later delivers an affective haiku with a hilariously bewildering final line: “Whatever happened / To man’s best friend / Falling spring blossom.” One dog balks at his derelict Trash Island environs and declares, “I’m depressing.” Canine thoughts betray a treasure trove of literal jokes and misinterpretations and pointedly humanlike assumptions of self-importance. Chief (Bryan Cranston), the only stray of the central pack, is bitterly cagey, but only from lack of affection. When Atari prods Chief to fetch, Chief qualifies his submission: “I’m doing it because I feel sorry for you.” Chief wistfully tells Nutmeg (Scarlett Johansson), an elfin show-dog with perfectly fluffy caramel fur, “You belong somewhere. You have papers.” Oracle (Tilda Swinton), a gossipy pug, watches TV and interprets the news for others, hence her prescient “visions.”
The devious machinations of humankind seem even more dastardly from the canine perspective, but even the dogs are thwarted by prejudice. The indoor dogs cow at rumors of savage dogs that roam the island, unhinged and cannibalistic. They later encounter this menagerie of earnest, scar-speckled, neon-colored outcasts, and Anderson’s tenderness and diligent attunement to the true innocence of canine nature manifests especially in how the maimed dogs express their trauma through spontaneous tears.
In Anderson’s world, unadulterated youthful passion allied with the unshakable loyalty of dogs trump hatred in an obvious but nonetheless powerful allegorical clash of good and bad. Chief and his canine cohorts are exemplary democratic citizens, staging group-votes on all decisions they make, and their goofy but enterprising camaraderie shames the hordes of Kobayashi proponents who are blinded by group-think. Kobayashi’s commandeering of the media and stentorian declarations seem like rhetorical strategies borrowed from a modern, orange demagogue. But in making Kobayashi a muted incarnation of nefarious monomaniacs of a distant but sordid past, and not one who acts out of any suggested insecurity or personal trauma but out of inherent, vicious prejudice, Kobayashi unquestionably invites vitriol. Anderson limns Kobayashi in rigid, two-dimensional strokes. In the interest of keeping spoilers to a minimum—and to curtail self-indulgent quibbling about an otherwise magical feat of a film—someone so unilaterally evil wouldn’t believably be so receptive to Atari’s emotional appeals.
Aesthetically, the film is a wondrous fantasia of art. A narrator (Courtney Vance) recounts the epic in stages as furious drumming by sumo wrestlers provide dramatic transitions, and the film announces itself through intertitles and side commentary (read captions quickly to catch them all) that intimate Anderson’s ecstatically playful visual style and daffy humor. It’s a film about the theatrics of translation: “All barks have been rendered into English.” Sprawling, gloriously illustrated tableaus of Japanese landscapes recall woodblock prints and switch out of scenes like theatrical murals. Anderson’s shifts between from 2D silhouettes that resemble shadow-puppets to startlingly material 3D figurines add a frenetic and dramatic flair to the epic. Despite a forgivably practical plot gimmick, this is a tale that all creatures will want to tell (dogs were cordially invited to some screenings), in whatever language they see fit.

I hear a very specific conversation all the time. It always starts the same: Someone proudly states that they love all music except for country. Then, someone else pushes back by asking about a token “acceptable” country artist like Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, or even Sturgill Simpson—a conceivably genre-bridging artist or someone whose artistry is so influential that there’s really no shame in saying you like them. Eventually, both parties work towards a middle ground where they simply agree that all mainstream country is terrible and leave it at that.
Country is constantly treated as a mockery of a genre, one that’s full of rednecks singing about cheap beer, pickup trucks, and girls in cutoffs. It’s derided as a musically stagnant genre that panders to Southerners and reactionaries through fake twangs and celebrations of rural life. But why do we feel so comfortable uniformly casting off an entire genre without further evaluation?
For one, country appeals to an aging, lower class blue collar community that few music fans outside of the South feel any connection to or sympathy for. It’s easy to ignore a relatively self-contained genre when you also can’t relate to it at all. Yet country artists have written some of the most poignant, heartbreaking ballads about the failures of American society and economy of any genre. George Jones, Loretta Lynn, and Lucinda Williams are just a few examples. Moreover, many of the genre’s biggest anthems are targeted at empowering people often seen as low class or trashy. Critics of country tend to cite mainstream or radio country as the source of the problem in pushing a pandering, overly sappy sound that’s often taken to be representative of the entire genre (see Luke Bryan or Dierks Bentley), but this view omits a massive portion of talented and complex artists on country radio stations. There are dozens of country artists who are adept at subverting preconceived notions about the genre and making clever and engaging art—Brad Paisley is a master of this. So is Kacey Musgraves. Artists obviously don’t have to be masters of satire to be good, and there are also tons of popular country artists who excel as musicians. Chris Stapleton, Keith Urban, and Vince Gill are all immensely talented in this field. Moreover, artists like Sam Hunt and Maren Morris have a flair for genre-bending incorporating sounds and styles from across R&B, soul, folk, rock, and modern pop into their songs. Claiming all country is the same misses how stunningly diverse the genre actually is.
The people who suffer most from the mischaracterization of country tend to be artists who don’t fit the mold. Because country codes for masculine in many people’s eyes, rural, and conservative, artists outside of that narrow range tend to be overlooked. Women artists, like Kelsea Ballerini, Carrie Underwood, and Miranda Lambert are all acclaimed and stunning acts. Yet sexism not only precludes them from being discussed in conversations about country artists, but it also prevents their artistry from being considered legitimate in a historically male-dominated music canon. Even though Lambert and Musgraves have never put out less than stellar albums, any time their names are brought up, they’re categorically met with complete derision as musicians. Furthermore, many of country’s biggest names are left-leaning, and their work reflects their ideologies. Because so much of the country market focuses on Southern or suburban conservatives, these views are expressed in subtle and subversive ways that are often masterful. Brandy Clark, Margo Price, and Lucinda Williams are all amazing at writing music that encapsulates their views and beliefs without alienating their main fan base. Criticism of the genre as a singular form is lazy and omits all of these facets and the work of so many talented artists.
What’s most shocking is the extent to which this perception has pervaded. Even mainstream music publications, which are supposed to review the output of artists from all sorts of different backgrounds, are far less likely to review an album by a big name country artist than they are one by a rock, pop, or rap artist. Country artists rarely make it onto year-end lists and, if they do, their work is seldom reviewed beforehand. Aside from a small handful of generally acceptable names, country artists are largely even ignored by the publications that are supposed to up their exposure.
While country appeals to a certain sensibility and style, categorical dislike or omission of the genre without putting in sufficient effort to explore its diversity and nuances is problematic. Complete disregard for a genre that so openly focuses on the struggles of frustrated, disenfranchised working class people tends to depend on some form of classism. Anti-country discourse heavily calls upon the views we have of Southerners and rural Americans, consciously or not, and far less on the music itself. Deriding the expressiveness, the imagery, or the sound because of a twang, a mandolin, or a general sense of corniness often feels like it’s in bad taste. At the end of the day, we need to reevaluate the way we interact with country music. It’s not just a bland, uniform medium for rednecks. If you treat it as such, you’re probably classist.

XXXTentacion is undoubtedly talented. Born Jahseh Onfroy, he emerged from the SoundCloud rap scene and released his first EP at the age of 16, followed a year later by his first album, “17.” And perhaps because of his unconventional start, he has been more willing to deviate from norms of rap and hip-hop, which has consistently landed him on Billboard’s top hits.
The now 20-year-old rapper is also one of the most controversial artists of his time, and for good reason. He has a history of violence against women that includes physical abuse of his then-pregnant ex girlfriend, allegations of torture, kidnapping, and sexual assault, and has been in and out of jail since 2016. Yet his short but extremely successful career has remained largely unaffected by his behavior: He wrote his newly released second album “?” on house arrest while awaiting trial for 15 felony charges, including aggravated battery of a pregnant woman, domestic battery by strangulation, false imprisonment, and witness-tampering.
So how does “?” reconcile any of this?
It doesn’t. Set alone, “?” seems like a look at the inner workings of a troubled young rapper, an experimental blend of acoustic sound with modern trap. In his opening track, “Introduction (instructions),” X doesn’t rap or sing, but speaks without background noise: “This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last. It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time. So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind, feeling my insanity, feeling my genius, my energy. Enjoy.” But, contextualized, the album paints over the inexcusable attitudes that have consistently manifested in his actions. His behavior should taint how we listen to his music—how else are we to respond? Yes, artists who violate the law are by no means a novel concept, but “?” is so imbued with aggression and sexual overtones that separating the artist from the person is impossible.
“Floor 555” is the most explicitly belligerent in tone. Over a rumbling beat, X yells repeatedly, “Fuckboy, don't test, boy, don't test / Boy, don't test, boy, don't test,” an angrier rendition of his 2016 song “Don’t Test Me.” “schizophrenia” is similar with its bursts of screaming and menacing drums as he screeches, “Don’t give up, don’t give up.” There does seem to be a hint of pained remorse in “PAIN = BESTFRIEND” when he sings, “Lost in regret, I / Feel so deeply, I can't seem to find the means of ground,” but his outlet for regret is still vocally strained screaming, which closes out the last 40 seconds of the 100-second song, leaving no room to explore the nuances of his anguish. This aggression also transfers to his views on sex, as “SMASH!” is exactly what it implies.
The seemingly tender tracks of his album, “the remedy for a broken heart (why am I so in love),” “SAD!” and “NUMB,” are superficially so, with lofty lyrics that rely on repetitive lines and filler tunes. Along with completely random tracks like “I don’t even speak spanish lol” and “Hope” (which begins with a shout out to the Parkland shooting), they muddle X’s hasty attempts to address his behavior and make his aggression seem even more startling in comparison.
X’s failure to adequately articulate the inner workings of his “mind, insanity, genius, and energy” makes for not only a chaotic album but a problematic one. “?” is as disjointed as it is superficial, and other than abrasive screaming, its short 18 tracks have few unifying threads. It’s still his most emotional work to date, but his attempt to wear his heart on his sleeve fails because that sleeve hides an abusive hand, one that has also been blindly given a mic.

With its indie pop soundtrack, sassy drama teachers, zany principals, and archetypal main-character-crawls-out-of-window-onto-balcony-to-reflect-on-the-world scenes, “Love, Simon” screams Young Adult just like the book it is based on, “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda” by Becky Albertalli. Both the book and the film follow the life of Simon (Nick Robinson), your average high school student, as he navigates coming out as gay and falling in love with his mysterious email pen-pal, Blue. Then, the two versions diverge. Whereas, in “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda,” Simon learns to accept himself with his newly realized sexuality, in “Love, Simon,” Simon learns to accept himself despite his sexuality. This key difference in message makes the movie, eagerly anticipated by audiences as an authentic coming out story, deemphasize the personal self-acceptance that is necessary for a story of this kind.
In the movie, Simon has reactions ranging from discomfort to outright homophobia and transphobia. During a Halloween party, Simon ridicules the “Freudian Slip” costume of his friend, Martin (Logan Miller), saying he looks like “a drag queen rolled around in magnet poetry.” Simon can’t even handle dancing in color-block outfits to Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” because, as he says, he’s “maybe not that gay.” Simon’s aversion to flamboyance is a reflection of a greater internal desire to embrace his all-hoodie wardrobe and be more straight-acting, and this desire never changes nor is it openly addressed. When Simon’s friend, Leah (Katherine Langford), tells him that she’s “killing off hetero Simon in her mind,” he immediately objects. Ever after coming out, Simon is still afraid that people’s opinions about him will change. He becomes obsessed with acting straight and rejects homophobic stereotypes. However, the lengths Simon goes to in order to define himself by what he is not (“I’m gay, but I’m not…”) suggests that being gay is an imposed identity rather than something that has always been a part of him. Thus, Simon’s efforts to appeal to the idea of “normality” in society make the source material’s original message obsolete.
In “Love, Simon,” acceptance of Simon’s homosexuality comes from external factors, rather than from Simon himself. In some scenes, this allyship and support is perfectly balanced. Simon’s mother (Jennifer Garner) gives a tear-jerking speech about Simon finally having the chance to fully breathe and affirms that Simon is still Simon, just as he has always been. The purity of Garner’s performance in her role and great script in this scene make the speech stand out as something deep, personal, and authentic. THe film veers from the personal journey that is so central to Simon’s story in the book.
There are times in the movie when allyship is overbearing and takes the spotlight away from the main character in a self-congratulatory manner. The contrasting ways the film and movie respectively depict the ferris wheel scene exemplify this difference. In the book, the ferris wheel is the site for Simon and Blue’s private rendezvous. Here, they are able to meet for the first time in private, without social pressures. In the movie, this privacy evaporates. After publicly calling on Blue to meet and reveal himself on the ferris wheel, Simon rides the wheel around and around while the entire student body watches him in anticipation for Blue’s reveal and burst into applause when he and Simon meet and kiss. While a great display of allyship, it distracts from the character development of Blue and Simon, reducing their coming out to a self-congratulatory publicity statement about the openness of the community rather than an emotional climax of Simon and Blue’s coming out and self-acceptance.
Excitement for “Love, Simon” was high in the BGLTQ community. Riding high on the success of more diverse films, “Love, Simon” marketed itself as part of this movement. Its distinct feel-good, Young Adult feel differs sharply from the disproportionate number of movies that focus on struggle, pain, loss, and death in the BGLTQ cannon. Its general romantic comedy-esque lightheartedness is perhaps symbolic of the changing times in many parts of the world where being BGLTQ has perhaps become somewhat easier than in the past because of a more tolerant society. There is a new generation who believes, as Simon in the movie says, “everyone deserves a good love story.” But while the movie points out the need, it does not act as a remedy. Unlike “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda,” which is an authentic tale of a young boy’s personal transformation in coming out as a gay man, “Love, Simon” focuses too much on being accepted by society rather than on self-acceptance.

Madeleine L’Engle’s novel “A Wrinkle in Time” can feel like a constellation of concepts too abstract to be understood. Written during the tense U.S.-Soviet space race, the novel whisks away its characters into the cosmos, and its slim binding opens up to a fifth dimension, three sages who were once literal stars, and a crawling mass of evil itself.
L’Engle anchors such immense imaginings in earthly detail. The novel’s self-mocking humor and the specific struggles of its characters temper the unimaginable with the tangible. Ava DuVernay’s 2018 sparkly film adaptation tips the story further toward the realm of the grandiose, sometimes at the cost of the personal narratives that originally kept it grounded.
The year before the novel’s publication in 1962, a Soviet, followed by an American, had become the first human in space. NASA was just four years old. Neil Armstrong would not set foot on the moon until seven years later. While literature has imagined space travel since the second century, 1962 was a particularly exciting time to write about entering space. L’Engle’s imagination filled the gaps in scientific knowledge with concepts as large as the fifth dimension (which allows characters to wrinkle space and time) and love.
In retrospect, the space scene of both the book and the film, in which a girl’s love for her brother defeats Evil itself on a faraway planet, seems to fight the tensions of nuclear warfare and the space race. L’Engle imagines a space journey that threatens to end in the world’s devastation but instead ends in peace.
Whether or not L’Engle intended to comment on destructive political tensions, her novel promotes communication and understanding between dissimilar people. On a terrestrial scale, protagonist Meg Murry (Storm Reid) and her little brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) are ostracized at school, leading to Meg’s increasingly aggressive behavior. The dystopian planet called Camazotz to which everyone moves amplifies L’Engle’s critique of exclusionary thinking, as does the brainwashing of Charles Wallace. In the novel, he responds to his sister’s recitation of the Declaration of Independence by saying, “That’s exactly what we have on Camazotz. Complete equality. Everybody exactly alike.” Meg retorts, “Like and equal are not the same thing at all!” The characters’ strengths, the story reveals, lie in their abilities to relate to people who are not like them.
DuVernay’s film debuted during another escalation of nuclear tensions and another resurgence of nationalism. However, in the film, the critique of exclusionary thinking is overshadowed by a plea for self-acceptance, which was secondary in the novel. The film skips the diversity-promoting scene with the Declaration of Independence, for example, and foregrounds confidence using saccharine lines like “You just have to find the right frequency and have faith in who you are.” The banal sentiment is rehashed by the soundtrack’s whiny pop anthems. In a similar spirit, the film sanitizes the story of Meg’s friend Calvin’s (Levi Miller) emotionally estranged, physically abusive family, but adds the same aforementioned self-acceptance backstory for Meg’s schoolyard bully (Rowan Blanchard): She takes her insecurity about her weight out on Meg.
This is not to say the theme of embracing multiplicity over uniformity is missing from the film. The casting of a multiracial Murry family, which was white in the book, aligns with the book’s encouragement of diversity. In fact, the casting of a black Meg can be seen as a update on L’Engle’s original decision to make her protagonist a girl, which was unusual in science fiction and possibly a reason why reason at least 26 publishers rejected her. The placement of people in unusual roles was at the heart of the book’s conception.
Still, a certain eccentricity is lost from page to screen. The contrast is most apparent in the portrayals of Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), the stars-turned-almost-women who guide the children through their space journey to save their scientist father. Mrs. Which has a golden moment of humor in the novel when she begins to materialize on Earth but proclaims, “I ddo nott thinkk I willl matterrialize commpletely. I ffindd itt verry ttirinngg.” Not only does Winfrey as Mrs. Which materialize in the film, but she arrives magnified to a giant’s size, cut and pasted into the sky like an unwieldy photoshop project. Another delightful image lost in translation onto the screen is Mrs. Whatsit, engulfed in an outfit of scarves, falling over in the Murrys’ kitchen and leaking rain water out of her boots. While the film has spectacular technology at its fingertips, the book ultimately manages to capture the most stunning visuals.
As if the celebrity presences of Winfrey, Witherspoon, and Kaling are not conspicuous enough, they wear jeweled eyebrows and gowns that could be their next Met Gala outfits. The film’s reluctance to show the Mrs. as anything less than breathtaking weakens the book’s earnest respect for oddball characters. The film generally avoids the grotesque images that help make the book compelling. Everyone and everything is impossibly pretty. And yet, despite the attempts at visual splendor, the on-screen renderings are somehow less stunning than L’Engle’s descriptions.
The story, already cosmic in nature, did not need the film’s attempts to add resplendency. Still, the film would have benefitted from taking itself a little less seriously. An openness to more of the book’s awkwardness, humor, and pain would have helped to remind viewers why, for 56 years, readers have accompanied L’Engle’s misfit characters on their mind-boggling journey through space and time.

The grill reflected the twinkling bonfire. Sizzling sounds emerged from the salmon steak and chicken fillet, unfit for my vegetarian stomach. A few people had started dancing, beers in hand, their figures standing out against the dark, velvety sea. The fluorescent lights of the harbor illuminated lonely gantry cranes in the distance. I suddenly felt like I was one of them.
“So, who are you?” The woman at the grill asked, with the professional smile of a hotel receptionist.
Who am I?
“I mean, what do you do? What’s your thing?” She asked the customary follow-up question. She had just finished telling me about her position as a teaching assistant for modern Hebrew.  I thought her name was Alex, short for Alexandra and that she was from New York—either the city or the state.
“Well I don’t think my thing defines who I am.” I wanted to avoid talking about film. “Like, people always talk about their jobs and hobbies when they meet, because it’s the easiest thing to talk about. But it’s not necessarily the essence of their identity. You know what I mean?”
“That’s an interesting answer.” She looked surprised. At that moment, Kwan Yin wandered over.
“How’s everything going down here?” She, too, had a beer in her hand. She turned to the woman beside me. “Jan is wondering if you could add some chicken tenders to the grill. Also I see you’ve met my new friend?”
“Yeah, I was just asking what he does,” Alex said.
“Oh, he’s a filmmaker!” Kwan Yin said, sounding proud. “You should tell Alec about your script! It’s interesting.”
“Ah! What is it about?” Alex asked.
“Well, it’s about a girl who wakes up and realizes the door of her room has disappeared, so she just stays there for a very long time.” I felt self-conscious about how uninteresting the idea sounded. “The thing is that it’s going to be one person and one room for the entire film. Once the door is gone, she realizes she never had any real urge to leave the room in the first place.”
“I see. So is it kind of a commentary on our modern world? Like with the Internet and smartphones and everything. We’re living in such a secluded world. And now there’s VR.”
That was not what the film was really about, but I wasn’t sure what it was about either.
“And how did you get into film?” Alex asked.
I didn’t want to talk about film anymore. I had come to Hong Kong to rethink my relationship with film, but I hadn’t achieved anything significant in the past week, and now I just wanted to spend my last four days listening to the seawaves.
“I’m from a small city in west China and my family is working class, so when I was a teenager I thought there was nothing interesting to do.” I said. “Then I discovered film, and I felt like I could connect with the people and places in film more than I could with people and places in my real life. I guess that was my first experience with film. It’s probably all escapism.”
I suddenly noticed the full moon and the ocean twinkling along with the bonfire. “Actually, my parents didn’t let me watch too many movies because it distracted me from my studies. So I would take my little MP4 player to bed with me, wait until my parents were sleeping, and then watch movies under the blanket. I used to imagine that all the young people around the world who watched films under blankets would start a film club together. We would call it 3AM Cinema Club.”
Alex listened attentively. I thought what I had just said was inappropriately sentimental for someone I’d just met, so I appreciated her patience. She was a nice person, but I didn’t know what else to talk to her about. Kwan Yin seemed to notice what was on my mind and started a new topic. Soon she and Alex got into a heated discussion about recent podcasts. I allowed myself to zone out and wondered what my girl-in-the-room would be doing about now.
—Staff writer Tianxing V. Lan's column, "3AM Cinema Club," is a serialized work of fiction set in Hong Kong which follows the protagonist as he works to write a screenplay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is something terribly conspicuous about the sound of high heels on a sidewalk.
It was one of the first things that I noticed when I came to the Boston area. I had never really lived anywhere where walking was my primary mode of transportation, and I loved it. I loved being outside throughout the day. I loved people-watching and window shopping. I spent hours during my first weeks at Harvard simply wandering around Cambridge, learning how to get from place to place.
However, I had also never lived anywhere where catcalling was so common.
My hometown of Austin, Texas is no safe haven from catcalling. If you walk down the wrong street, someone is bound to whistle at you from across the intersection. However, for me, catcalling in Austin was something that happened downtown on a Saturday night. It was not something that happened during a Tuesday afternoon trip to CVS.
In Boston, that was no longer the case. No matter where I was, there was a chance that someone might roll down their car window and shout at me. Even the man holding the door for me at the coffee shop invariably did so while making some devaluing comment. I felt watched in a way that I had never experienced before.
As a result, I became hyper-aware of my presentation. I took note of my clothing, my makeup, my hair—everything about myself that might attract unwanted attention. And the thing that stood out the most? My heels.
Now, when I say “heels,” I don’t mean red Louboutins. I mean a pair of slightly beat-up boots purchased at a discount shoe store that happen to have a 2-inch cork heel.
These shoes were not glamorous. As a matter of fact, glamour had nothing to do with the issue at hand. It was not a question of looks, but of sounds—more precisely, the particular clomping sound that high heels make with their wearer’s every step.
Of course, catcalling happens regardless of women’s clothing or footwear choices. Unsolicited attention does not discriminate.
Still, there was something inexplicably unsettling about my walk, of all things, becoming a spectacle. Because, when you walk everywhere, you walk everywhere. Every day, as I made my way down the street, I felt like I was announcing my femininity to everyone I passed. My movement itself created confinement. After all, how can you escape something that—quite literally—follows your every step?
My walk was gendered: My walk made me feel unsafe.
Even if the causal relationship between high heels and catcalling may have been partly imagined, its effect upon me was incredibly real. Before I could act or speak, my shoes spoke for me. They did not tell the world anything about my thoughts or values. They just loudly announced that a woman was coming.
I began wearing sneakers more often. Though I made no conscious decision to abandon them, my beat-up pair of heeled boots slowly made their way to the back of my closet. As I walked through Harvard Square in my Converses, I took solace in the fact that my now-silent footsteps did not seem to cause anyone to look up. The semi-frequent shouts and gazes did not stop, but it seemed as though they lessened. I felt as though I had regained control.
Now, I find that my understanding of this control has altered. Because changing a behavior based on a response isn’t an exercise of personal authority at all. It’s a concession—and a concession that I don’t want to make, at that. I like my heeled boots. I like the sound that they make as I walk down a street or hallway. I like having a presence, even if that presence might sometimes make me uncomfortable.
Today, as I write, I am looking down at that same pair of beat-up boots, which are on my feet again after several long months of neglect. It is an undoubtedly small gesture, yet it feels significant. There is nothing inherently remarkable about allowing oneself to be noticed—people do far braver things each day. But this is something. This is a step.
My walk remains conspicuous, and I am still unsettled by each encounter that I have with unsolicited attention. I do not think that unsettledness will soon fade. However, I will not allow that feeling to dictate my self-expression. There is great power in the clopping of heels. There is great power in femininity. And I hope to embrace that power with each step that I take.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A month after the Chronicle of Higher Education published a report revealing that more than 10 women have alleged that Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez sexually harassed them, Harvard’s response is not auspicious with regards to eliciting tangible changes in campus culture.
The University has done the bare minimum in response to the Dominguez allegations. Sending emails, creating committees, and hosting town halls amounts to a lot of talk and little action. Since the publication of the report, Dominguez has retired, the Government Department has hosted two town halls and founded a “climate change” committee to address issues of sexual harassment, and students at the College have received email reassurances from Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and the College Title IX coordinators urging them to share their experiences and concerns with administrators. On the surface, these responses may seem to broach the topic of campus sexual assault, but they fail to address the underlying and immediate issues at stake.
Semantics are not without importance here: The committee’s aim of “climate change” instead of addressing the actions that Dominguez allegedly committed echoes the bureaucracy of Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild’s claim that the committee "is beginning its work to frame an agenda of the most important changes to pursue," and "will create working groups to address that agenda.” That agenda should be clear already: The department needs to make every effort it can to ensure that women feel comfortable in the classrooms and other settings that form the foundation of its educational program.
In general, the University glosses over and talks around issues of sexual misconduct. The Title IX Office, which emailed students to remind them of the resources available only this Monday, should not only have emailed the community immediately following the Dominguez incident when students were feeling most distraught, but also should have addressed Dominguez’s actions by name as present and pressing, and laid out a plan of response that would result in definitive action. These are certainly tough topics to discuss, but any sort of real change requires a clear dialogue and, more importantly, actionable plans for change.
As of now, we lack confidence in the University’s commitment to eliminating sexual harassment and assault. When the University published its sexual assault report in 2016, revealing that 31 percent of women reported experiencing assault in their time at Harvard. Immediately after the report’s publication, campus rape and assault became a key issue for administrators, yet the findings of the report and its proposed solutions are now rarely addressed. We suspect the uptick in dialogue in the aftermath of the Dominguez allegations will similarly peter out and result in no University policy change.
One way in which the College can attempt break this cycle is by requiring Title IX training all four years. At the College, students are only required to complete online Title IX trainings in their first year. All faculty, administrators, and students alike should be required to complete dynamic, multi-faceted trainings that address the varying manifestations of sexual assault and harassment each year at the University. Students further need to be held accountable for completing the trainings. There is a vast bureaucratic infrastructure in place full of individuals—including Resident Deans, tutors, proctors, and coordinators at the Title IX Office—who could follow-up with students who have not completed their training. Yet, year after year, students are allowed to feel comfortable skipping what should be standard and mandatory training.
Increased trainings exemplify one step forward, but there is more the University needs to do. Women will not come forward with allegations if they feel they will be abandoned by administrators and faculty members, as happened in the cases brought by Dominguez’s accusers and countless other individuals who have shared their stories with The Crimson (and those who have not). It is paramount that we productively move forward from past conversations toward enacting new policies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Salma: As we’re writing this, we’re counting down the hours to a long awaited meeting with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis, and Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller about our UC Proposal for a Physical Space for Belonging on campus. Throughout the process of advocating for this space, we’ve received a lot of feedback on our methods; surprisingly, mostly praise comes from people who commend us for being “reasonable enough” to be willing to sit down with administrators, to work towards a solution that is moderate enough that works for all of us—“reasonable enough” to compromise. With these comments often comes an implicit disdain for other people “constantly yelling on the steps of University Hall”, placing us above them in their strange mental rankings of who does advocacy work best. We’re pushing back.
Nicholas: This is not an apology for Black moderates. In-system reform work too often is a perpetuation of the status quo, becoming an insidious way for structures of oppression to sustain themselves. But, Salma, I don’t think either of us would fit into any definition of “moderate.” For every person who’s praised our “sensible” strategies, there’s a Crimson commenter accusing us of inciting race wars. For every time we’ve sat down across from a dean to hash out policy details, there’s another when we can be found chanting in the streets. We are not unique in this regard. Black activists constantly toe the line between working in- and out-of-system, because Black radical activism must balance our end goals—a world severely, radically different from the one we live in—with the complexities and nuances, the limitations, of the here and now. Both our detractors and our supporters must accept this fundamental ambivalence in Black activism.
S: In the specific case of our work pushing for a physical space for belonging, all of our success so far has rested on the threat of protest, the threat of public shaming, the threat of a smear campaign against Harvard. Students of color on this campus are angry. We are frustrated, we are exhausted, hurt, broken, drowning—and we’re ready to take action. We’re ready to rally our folks and march in the Yard until our protests are garnering national attention.
Administrators know this. They’ve heard the rallying cries at town halls, in Crimson columns, in emails, in conversations with students. They know there is a fire brewing on this campus, and that there has been for quite some time. Without this threat, there would be no real danger in remaining apathetic for administrators. It is because of our coalition, our friends and allies who are rallying and organizing and raising hell, that administrators are even willing to sit down with us and listen.
N: The point is that there is not simply one way to do radical activism, and that we should never use one to condemn the other. In fact, the two—the work we do at the table and the work we join our friends and allies on in the streets—sustain each other, and cannot survive apart.
We have to play the game. It’s life or death. And so Black activists meet with neoliberal politicians on Capitol Hill, and teach radical Black theory at white institutions, and yes, sit down with Harvard College administrators. Because while the master’s tools may never dismantle the master’s house, we still must live and breathe. We must survive. The work we do at the table is about survival.
But we must dream too. We cannot survive for survival’s sake, because that, in the end, is just another kind of death. We must live for something impossible. And it is only by uniting our work at the table with the spirit of radical Black activism, it is only by refusing to buy fully into the master’s game, that this becomes possible.
S: Last semester one of my TFs told me that I wasn’t a reformist, but rather, a radical. Honestly, I freaked out. In my history classes I had always learned that the radicals were the ones who never got anything done, that Malcolm X and Angela Davis and Stokely Carmichael were the ones raising hell without ever pushing the needle forward. I hated the label of radical. I wanted to shed myself of it. But I didn’t understand how radicalism and reformism have always been linked, that they rely on one another—that both are necessary to advance the project of justice.
Such is the case with our work towards a Physical Space for Belonging on campus. Without the threat of a radical response to complacency, any kind of progress towards a better vision of our community would hardly be possible. They operate in tandem. They are codependent.
N: Exactly. The binarism between radicalism and in-system work is ill-founded. But it is not the case that we and those in the streets are “two sides of the same coin.” Rather, we must collapse the binary entirely. We are in the streets and at the table. Our work at the table is informed by, led by, our work in the streets. They cannot exist apart.
In 1964, a photo was taken of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. meeting for the first time. The photo captures the two en route to sit in on a Senate debate on what would become the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the pinnacle of the in-system work of Black activists. These activists were often the very Black folks—like King himself—that radicals like Malcolm X would so often be pitted against (normally by white moderates). And yet here Malcolm X stands with King, both equally invested in this project of reform, a project that is hand-in-hand—not in contradiction—with radicalism.
En route into the master’s house, to sit on the master’s chair and listen to the master’s game take place, the complexity of Black activism rests and takes its place, and dreams of a better world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since winning the South African presidency two months ago, Cyril Ramaphosa has made land reform “without compensation” a priority, breaking from the policy of the African National Congress under his predecessor Jacob Zuma. Unlike similar proposals for land redistribution from years past, Ramaphosa’s do not register as fringe politics—in part because they have materialized in the increasingly radical era of the Economic Freedom Fighters, a protracted national growth slowdown, and a burgeoning water emergency in Cape Town.
This unfortunate admixture has prompted many to question the South Africa of the last 25 years: the sentimentalism for Nelson Mandela, the prospects of a “rainbow nation,” the potential for postcolonial “constitutional order.” In a sense, South Africa has put itself and the world on notice: Radicals are not to be discounted.
The science behind land transfers at times seems more like alchemy. One author and self-styled “[l]and issues expert” recently suggested that “the state’s priority should now be on unlocking the productive potential” of new tenants. Ramaphosa meanwhile has insisted that expropriating portions of the white farming class’s land must proceed in a manner  to ensure “everybody’s rights are protected.”
These approaches to redistribution belie their own motivating anxieties surrounding colonialism, apartheid, and the amorphous—but not illegitimate—thirst for justice. They also risk exacerbating the present discontent, leaving the country susceptible to formulaic fixes like Zimbabwe’s and a worsening agrarian commotion, which farmers and private security companies have already begun to observe.
Unfortunately, it seems South Africa will have to go it alone as it litigates these issues. In the bygone ages of Woodrow Wilson or John F. Kennedy ’40, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, America might have offered some sort of policy or moral guidance. But no longer in the era of President Donald Trump, Twitter tirades, and trade wars.
The contrast is stark. In the mid-nineties, then-President Clinton summoned a vision of American global responsibility that this author still finds compelling: that “we can’t respond to every tragedy in every corner of the world, but just because we can’t do everything for everyone doesn’t mean … we should do nothing for no one.”
Clinton, of course, referred to his actions in the Serbian Crisis—a catastrophe that easily eclipses South Africa’s present tensions. Nonetheless, the current dodge by Washington feels jarring, particularly when silhouetted against the president’s priorities: A visit to the site of the future border wall, a memorandum advancing the transgender troop ban, and tariffs on foreign steel. This list reads like a president’s doomsday preparations, not an agenda for global security and economic resurgence. It embodies the “do nothing for no one” philosophy which Clinton warned against.
Admittedly, Trump is not entirely to blame for this approach. The concept of a global political arbiter registers uneasily with the historical sense of many libertarians and left-liberals (including, at times, this one). It evokes an age of faux “good neighbor” policy, Third World proxy wars, and stereotypical American bravado.
An American watchman can also seem ill-suited to a world increasingly hostile to liberal democracy. Some have asked whether it is worth projecting American-style democracy, which has devolved across Eastern Europe and parts of Latin America, abroad. Others are asking whether the “free world” (perhaps an outdated concept in the Trump era) still needs a leader.
These perspectives lose sight of the failures of global anomie. In South Africa, constitutional property protections are on the line, and the liberal Democratic Alliance hasn’t the means to defend them. The rights of South African laborers are also in danger, evidenced by the recent police killing of forty-two miners. The Middle East is embroiled in new Sunni-Shiite tensions. North Korea is close to achieving a nuclear warhead with global range. These are all elements of a disturbing eschatology that must be resolved.
In South Africa’s case, U.S. silence means partial fixes are probably the best option. Two routes give South Africa a wide berth from potential calamity. The government could open up state-owned fallow land for private purchase and cultivation, or it could subsidize land purchases by black tenants, upholding the “willing buyer-willing seller” principle advocated by the Democratic Alliance. Neither option will end South Africa’s infighting, but either would come closer to a Pareto efficient solution than Ramaphosa’s land grab.
These strategies would set a fairly radical precedent, bringing into focus a concept of justice reminiscent of early American progressive Herbert Croly, who pushed increasing prosperity for an “ever increasing majority.” This legacy, more than the pseudo-science of land transfers and faux proceduralism, would mark an important milestone for a country seeking justice and order in a world after pax Americana.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A host of campus and local labor unions released a statement Monday morning in support of the graduate student unionization effort, urging eligible graduate and undergraduate students to vote in favor of collective bargaining in the upcoming April 18 and 19 election.
Signatories to the letter included Harvard’s four campus unions: the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers; the Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guards Union; the 32BJ chapter of the Service Employees International Union; and UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents Harvard University Dining Services workers.
The letter was also sponsored by two Boston-area labor groups which represent construction and trade workers working at Harvard, the Area Trades Council and the Building and Trades Council of the Metropolitan District.
The upcoming April election follows a protracted legal battle before the National Labor Relations Board between the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers over the results of the an earlier Nov. 2016 unionization election.
At issue in that case was whether eligible voter lists provided by the University during the first election met the Board’s standards. After over a year of hearings and briefs before the regional and national NLRB, the Board ruled that the voter lists were inadequate, ordering a second election.
University staff assistant Emily Hankle was one of the HUCTW representatives involved in writing the support statement. She said HUCTW has been meeting with HGSU-UAW organizers for “some time,” though the latter group “led the effort” on curating the letter.
“We made a couple little tweaks here and there that put our voice on it as well. Then they passed it around to some of the other unions to make sure all the other unions were okay with it and came back to us and we said yes, we’d be happy to sign onto it,” Hankle said.
The authors of the letter wrote that HGSU-UAW’s success would bolster the efforts of all campus unions to effectively bargain with the University.
“We want to offer words of strong encouragement to students who support unions in general but are uncertain about working to build the HGSU-UAW union for themselves,” the letter reads. “Let’s be perfectly clear: the best way to support other unions and move working people forward is to create and strengthen your union. When one union wins, all unions win.”
The letter also states that the experience of other labor groups can “serve as a guide” for potential efforts by graduate students to negotiate for wages and benefits.
Graduate student and HGSU-UAW organizer Christine Mitchell wrote in an email that she is excited about the support from other labor groups.
"As a student who has worked closely with the other unions on campus, I have seen the efficacy and power of our solidarity in campaigns like the HUDS strike,” Mitchell wrote.
In an emailed statement in response to the letter, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven re-affirmed the University’s position on encouraging students to participate in the upcoming election.
“The University continues to encourage all eligible students to consider what unionization means for them academically, financially, and personally, and above all, to ensure that their voices are heard by going to the polls and voting on April 18 and 19,” Cowenhoven wrote.

The body of a 27-year old Cambridge man was pulled from the Charles River Saturday, and investigators do not consider his death suspicious, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office.
“Based on witness statements, video footage from nearby cameras, and additional evidence obtained by State Police detectives since Saturday morning, his death does not appear to be the result of foul play,” a spokesperson for District Attorney Daniel F. Conley wrote in an emailed statement.
The Massachusetts State Police were not immediately available for comment.
The man was pulled from the water near the Harvard Bridge, which crosses the Charles near MIT, according to the Boston Globe.
Officials are withholding the man’s name because they do not suspect foul play.
In past years, authorities have pulled bodies from the Charles River several times a year. Massachusetts State Police pulled adult males from the Charles River in both February and  May 2016.

Architect Mark Lee will serve as chair of the Graduate School of Design’s Architecture Department starting in July, the GSD announced earlier this week.
Lee holds a master’s degree from the GSD, where he has taught since 2013, and is a founder and leader of the architectural firm Johnston Marklee. He said in an interview Monday that he is “thrilled” to have been chosen as department chair.
“This is really an honorable position,” he said. “There have been many great chairs that have led the department. I’m excited to build on the achievements of my predecessors and take this department to the next level.”
Lee will take over as department chair from current interim Department Chair K. Michael Hays. In an interview, Hays said he is “excited” about Lee’s appointment because Lee has excelled as both a leader of an architectural firm and an academic.
“For GSD, which claims to be the best, the most globally important design school, to have those two dimensions—professional and academic—that's the most GSD could hope for,” he said.
GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi congratulated Lee in a statement earlier this week in which he called Lee’s firm “one of the most talented practices currently working in the United States and beyond.”
“Mark deeply understands the contemporary world of architecture,” he said. “His vision and leadership will enormously benefit our students and our School in the years to come.”
Lee’s appointment as department chair comes soon after GSD’s January announcement that Lee would serve as a professor of the practice of architecture. That appointment will also take effect in July.
While Lee said he is still “getting acclimated” to his new role as department chair, he said he plans to focus on efforts to narrow the gap between high-quality buildings and their less remarkable surroundings.
“There are great concert halls, great museums, great buildings in the public and private spaces being erected,” he said. “The gap between the exceptional buildings and the everyday buildings that make up our urban environment is getting wider. This general quality of the built environment needs to get much higher,” he said.
Past GSD architecture department chairs have included Walter Gropius, who founded the Bauhaus architectural school, and Rafael Moneo, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for architecture in 1996.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 27, 2018 at 3:50 p.m.
Two Harvard students have founded a support group for BGLTQ-identifying student-athletes—dubbed Queer Undergraduate Athletes That Do Sports, or QUADS—which held its first meeting in mid-February.
Co-founders and teammates on the men’s varsity swim and dive team Schuyler M. Bailar ’19 and David J. Pfeifer ’18 say the group is the first of its kind on Harvard’s campus. Bailar and Pfeifer both identify as BGLTQ, and Bailar—the first openly transgender student-athlete to compete on an NCAA Division 1 men’s team—has earned national attention for his advocacy for BGLTQ students.
Bailar and Pfeifer founded the group in February; the co-founders said the group has already earned official recognition from Harvard, meaning it has the right to reserve and use College spaces, among other privileges. Bailar and Pfeifer said they worked with Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, the director of the BGLTQ Office of Student Life, to form QUADS.
Bailar said both he and Pfeifer come from a “place of advocacy” that inspired them to create a space for BGLTQ-identifying athletes at Harvard.
“There's a lot of groups for queer people, but a lot of them, I think, focus on queer student life,” Bailar said. “Being an athlete is a totally different space, especially for queer people, because there's a lot more of gender performed through sport that can be violated to some degree.”
Pfeifer said the idea for the group came to him after he noticed he wasn’t the only openly BGLTQ individual on his team.
“I was thinking to myself that it doesn't seem right that there are people who are alone on their sports teams, or people who possibly are LGBTQ but don't feel comfortable because there's nobody else,” Pfeifer said. “So I kind of felt the necessity to  form a group out of that, out of, you know, me feeling lucky to have LGBTQ teammates.”
Pfeifer  and Bailar initially publicized the group by inviting friends to join. Eventually, though, Pfeifer reached out to the captains of every one of Harvard’s 42 varsity athletic teams. Pfeifer said 10 people attended the organization’s first meeting last month, but added that at least 24 students have so far expressed interest in joining QUADS.
Before officially becoming a member of QUADS, students must sign a confidentiality agreement, according to Bailar. He said the agreement helps ensure students feel comfortable and the identities of closeted athletes remain private.
“The membership won't be publicized unless you explicitly say so,” Pfeifer said. “So we're trying to kind of really foster that and drive that point home that, you know, it's a place where you can be yourself.”
QUADS will serve as a place to allow athlete-focused discussions about being BGLTQ as well as athlete-focused support for BGLTQ-identifying student athletes, Pfeifer said. Bailar encouraged allies to come to QUADS meetings, too.
The group plans to hold its next meeting April 8, according to Pfiefer.
Bailar said the founding of QUADS holds personal meaning for him.
“I think sports are a huge part of health and happiness for a lot of people,” he said. “If kids can't do the sport that they love or feel that they have to suffer or hide themselves because of their sport, or vice versa—can't be yourself because of your sport or can't do your sport because of yourself—that's a huge part of life there that doesn't exist there and a part of happiness that you don't get.”
“It means a lot to me to be able to be open about this,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David M. Rubenstein, a member of the Harvard Corporation, discussed his non-linear path to private equity, outlined his philanthropic vision, and ruminated on past failures at a Harvard Business School event Monday.
The Corporation is the University’s highest governing body; Rubenstein, the newest member of 13-person board, was appointed to the body in 2017. The 68-year-old co-founder of Carlyle Group—a D.C. based private equity group—is worth more than $2.6 billion and is known for his philanthropy. He also advises multiple prominent nonprofit and educational institutions, including chairing the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center and the Brookings Institution.
The Business School event was co-hosted by the Venture Capital and Private Equity Club, an HBS student group, and by the Conversations at Harvard series, which celebrated its 15th anniversary Monday. More than 100 people attended the informal town hall-style conversation.
Rubenstein began his remarks by asking the audience if they were surprised when they were accepted to Harvard. Rubenstein then said that he—unlike the audience, comprising mostly Business School students—would likely never receive a Harvard degree.
“I’m probably the only person here who will not get a Harvard degree,” he said. “I do enjoy what Harvard represents, which is the epitome of what the human brain can achieve when you have great scholars and great students coming together.”
Peter V. Emerson, the founder of Conversations at Harvard, explained he started the series—a program that invites prominent figures in various fields to Harvard’s campus—to encourage conversations in lieu of prepared speeches.
Before Rubenstein spoke to the audience, co-president of the Venture Capital and Private Equity club Jessie Cai explained the significance of the billionaire’s work across the past few decades.
“His efforts are wide-ranging, extending from arts, culture, health care, education. He’s even pioneered a new form of giving, called patriotic philanthropy, which is defined as giving back to our nation,” Cai said.
Rubenstein has practiced this form of philanthropy since at least 2007, when he purchased a copy of the Magna Carta and donated it to the National Archives. In Dec. 2011, Rubenstein donated $4.5 million to the National Zoo to support a giant panda reproduction program. In 2012, Rubenstein donated $7.5 million towards repairing the Washington Monument after an earthquake damaged the obelisk.
Most recently, in February, Rubenstein bought a rare copy of the Declaration of Independence—one of 51 known editions—for a price that numbered in “seven figures,” as he told the Washington Post.
“My theory is that if we learn more about our country’s history, or whatever country you are from, you’re more likely to be a more informed citizenry and a more informed citizenry will produce a better government,” he said at the event Monday.
Building on this theme, Rubenstein highlighted the role reading plays in creating citizens who actively participate in society.
“Thirty percent of all people who graduate from college never read another book in their entire life,” he said. “I am very worried about people not being able to read, because if you can’t read then you can’t be that effective.”
Rubenstein also discussed many of his personal failures. In one anecdote, Rubenstein described how he almost lost a scholarship offer at the University of Chicago Law School because he did not send in a $50 fee on time.
“I failed at many things and the failure has made me feel I should give back for the good luck,” said Rubenstein, who donated $10 million to the University of Chicago Law School in 2010.
Rubenstein noted that, even though members of the audience might boast one or more Harvard degrees, every single attendee will likely have to face failure.
In addition to accepting failure, Rubenstein advised students to prioritize their interests over what they believe might stand out on a resume.
“I would find one cause with which you can engage, and find one thing you’re passionate about,” he said. “If you can’t find it now, you’ll find it eventually. I think the mistake that I made is that I wasn’t as focused on the things that I’m focused on now, and I’m rushing to give back to society.”
Rubenstein recently served on Harvard’s presidential search committee, which comprised 12 members of the Corporation and three members from the Board of Overseers. The committee began searching for the successor to University President Drew G. Faust in summer 2017. On Feb. 11, the group announced it had selected Lawrence S. Bacow—who also served on the committee before stepping down midway through the search—to serve as Harvard’s 29th president.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John S. Wilson Jr., former president of Morehouse College and current president-in-residence at the Graduate School of Education, will serve as a senior adviser and strategist to Harvard's president on diversity and inclusion initiatives, University President Drew G. Faust announced Tuesday.
Wilson’s appointment coincides with the release of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging’s final report Tuesday. In the report, the task force—which Faust convened in Sept. 2016—called for central administrators to coordinate efforts to bolster diversity and inclusion across the University.
Wilson is currently a member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers—the University’s second-highest governing body—and served as the executive director of the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities under the Obama administration. While he was executive director, Wilson recommended University President-elect Bacow as an adviser to President Barack Obama on the initiative in 2009.
Bacow will take over from Faust in July, and it will fall to him to oversee the bulk of the task force’s recommendations.
Faust wrote that Wilson’s experience in higher education and connections to Harvard will enable him to “bring the task force report to life.” In his new role, he will be responsible for planning structures for improving inclusion at the University and hiring central administration personnel to conduct this work for the duration of this spring and next academic year.
In an interview Monday, Wilson said he is excited to work to make the Harvard experience “more enriching and fulfilling for more people.”
“This is what was most important for me and why I am truly excited in this role and invested in it, there is a sense that we can't truly be Harvard until we get this right, until we figure out how more graduates of Harvard can feel like it's my Harvard, too,” he said.
In her email, Faust also outlined her plans to begin implementing the task force’s recommendations before she steps down in June. She wrote that, with Bacow’s agreement, she decided to appoint Wilson now in order to ensure the presidential transition “does not delay the implementation of the task force’s recommendations.”
“In consultation with President-elect Bacow, I have identified actions that can be taken immediately and that I hope will serve to generate momentum for the longer-term strategic work that will extend well beyond my tenure,” Faust wrote.
The final report charges Harvard to “become its best self” through a framework of “Four Goals,” “Four Tools,” and a set of eight concrete recommendations—including enhancing mental health resources, improving recruitment and retention strategies for faculty, and establishing pipeline programs for staff, among other measures.
“[The task force’s] articulation of four goals and four tools, within the framework of pursuing excellence on a foundation of inclusion, defines an essential path for the University to pursue,” Faust wrote. “Through its eight recommendations, the task force has set out concrete steps to help start us down that path.”
As part of her immediate action points, Faust has designated $10 million in presidential funds to new faculty hires, provided additional presidential funds to enhancing mental health services, and required deans and administrators to produce plans to advance inclusion and belonging in their schools or units.
In addition, Faust said she and Bacow look forward to working with Government Professor Danielle S. Allen—one of the co-chairs of the task force—to establish the Smith Campus Center as a place for events surrounding “civil disagreement.”
“Both President-elect Bacow and I look forward to working with Professor Allen and others to imagine additional ways in which the Office of the President might help to sponsor community conversations designed with a similar goal of bringing together contrasting points of view on critical questions,” Faust wrote.
Faust also wrote she has asked administrators to develop policies to improve wayfinding on campus and ensure Harvard’s public art “reflects our commitment to belonging and inclusion.”
Faust, in the closing of her letter, said she is excited to sing the revised last line to the alma mater—also a task force initiative—at this May’s Commencement.
“When it comes time to sing our alma mater, updated at the suggestion of the task force, I will proudly give voice to the song’s new final line—and its recognition that the pursuit of truth and knowledge belongs to everyone at Harvard, from all backgrounds and beliefs,” Faust wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshmen students flooded Annenberg Hall Monday night to talk to advisers from all 49 concentrations and 9 unaffiliated secondary fields at the Advising Fortnight kickoff dinner on Monday evening.
The annual concentration fair is the opening event for Advising Fortnight, a two-week series of events aimed at helping first-year students start thinking about their concentration choice.
According to Assistant Director of Advising Programs Brooks B. Lambert-Sluder ’05, the kickoff event allows freshmen to sample different interests and get a sense of how they want to start exploring their future concentration—both over the next two weeks, and over the next several months before their decision.
Undergraduates have until November of their sophomore year to choose a concentration.
Catherine R. Shapiro, resident dean of freshmen for Crimson Yard, said the Advising Fortnight kickoff dinner can be an important time for first-years to begin considering what courses they might select in the upcoming semester. Many students might only begin taking introductory courses for their concentration in the fall of sophomore year.
“You need time to think about what you’ve heard and how that fits into your experience, so that when you go into sophomore year, you’re making good decisions,” Shapiro said.
While Monday’s concentration fair might have given students a first glimpse at prospective concentrations, Patrick D. Ulrich, associate director of undergraduate studies in Environmental Science and Engineering, said the kickoff dinner is only meant to be an introduction.
“It’s hard to talk in depth here, so the hope is to come up, meet us, and then let’s talk one-on-one when you’re actually really interested in what we’re offering,” Ulrich said.
In the following two weeks, students will have the chance to follow up on their concentration interests in a variety of events hosted specifically by faculty representatives from different departments.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said he would urge students to look at several options.
“I’d encourage them to go to a handful that seem close to their current interests and collect some information," he said. 
Ross Simmons ’21, who said he had no clear idea about his concentration choice, visited a plethora of tables.
“I talked to Earth and Planetary Sciences and Math and Physics and Classics and Government and Social Studies, and I made a sweep,” Simmons said.
Some student said that conversations with faculty members present at the event convinced them to consider a field that had not previously been on their minds.
“I had an interesting conversation with Andrew Berry because of this event, and I’m really glad, and now I’m actually maybe considering Integrative Biology,” Joyce Tian ’21 said.
Tian added that though the crowded event was “preposterously chaotic”, she was glad that “they’ve actually coalesced every single concentration and every single director of these concentrations specifically for us to talk to.”
Nishita Sinha ’21 like many of her peers, said she is still far from a final decision on her concentration.
“I talked to Gregory Tucci, which was really cool,” Sinha said. “He’s in Chemistry and I really wasn’t Chemistry, but he’s such a cool professor, and maybe I’ll do Chemistry now, like, who knows.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sandwiches are an American staple. From the classic hamburger to the Bobby Valentine wrap (to the hot dog?), a good sandwich can make for a great meal. However, the bread is crucial–without quality bread, a sandwich can quickly be ruined.
Sandwiched between two rough losses, Harvard softball exploded for 14 runs and an 11-run victory over Cornell on Monday afternoon at Niemand-Robison Field in Ithaca, N.Y. Framed by a stand of coniferous trees emblematic of the winter paradise that is Ithaca, Niemand-Robison Field also played host to a pair of games in which the Big Red outscored the Crimson by a combined 13-4 margin: in other words, the bread.
“With the win in game two...we strung a lot of hits together, producing runs each inning, we made the plays on defense that we needed to, and Katie Duncan threw a great game for us,” junior third baseman Erin Lockhart said. “With the losses, the Cornell hitters had a good plan against our pitchers and were able to produce. We struggled a bit with their pitcher, and it gives us something to work on.”
CORNELL 7, HARVARD 2
A superstitious person may claim that Harvard (10-11, 3-3 Ivy) used up all its runs in the first half of Monday’s action. Considering superstition or not, however, the final game of the series was eerily similar to Sunday’s opening matchup—the Crimson was limited to just two runs, and it would have been in contention for the whole game, save one explosive offensive inning for Cornell (7-9, 2-1).
This time, the Big Red cobbled together its extended rally earlier on, in the bottom of the second. Five of the six runs Cornell scored in this frame came from doubles. Olivia Lam and Avery Voehl hit back-to-back two-baggers, and Madeline Avery followed up with a ground-rule double later on in the inning. All told, the Big Red sent 10 batters to the plate in the bottom of the second, with Tori Togashi making both the first and last outs of the inning.
“They had the momentum and were hitting the ball hard each at-bat, which made them tough to get out,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “We need to learn how we can contain an offense exploding so we can limit the big innings.”
Rich had quite the day at the plate. After collecting three hits in Monday’s first game, two of which were triples, the shortstop went 2-for-4 with a pair of doubles in this contest. She scored three runs and drove in five between these two games.
Co-captain Maddy Kaplan extended her hitting streak to 12 games in this contest. The senior is third in batting average, second in on-base percentage, and seventh in slugging percentage among qualifying Ancient Eight batters with a .457/.506/.600 slash line.
HARVARD 14, CORNELL 3 (5 INNINGS)
Harvard’s offense was clicking so well on Monday afternoon that even pitcher Katie Duncan, in her first collegiate at-bat in a three-year career, sent a pitch sailing over the fence in center field. Duncan, one of seven Crimson to record a hit in the first game of the doubleheader, also notched a single in the top of the fourth and came around to score on a Rich triple.
“I wasn't really thinking about it as my first collegiate at-bat but instead as another opportunity to contribute my efforts to the team,” Duncan said. “The fact that the ball ended up going over the fence was an great result, but I was definitely more focused on the process.”
Monday’s first game was in stark contrast with Harvard’s two losses to Cornell. The Crimson scored in each of the game’s first four innings, tacking on a combined 11 runs between the third and the fourth. The 14 runs scored marked a season-high for any Ivy League team in a conference game this season.
In the top of the fourth, Harvard scored five runs on just two hits. The biggest play of the inning was Rich’s triple. With the bases loaded, the junior shortstop served a ball into the left-center gap, and Rich herself motored all the way around the bases, scoring on a throwing error by the Big Red’s center fielder. The three-base hit was Rich’s second of this game—she now leads the Ivy League with three triples.
The Crimson somehow had an even more momentous inning in its previous trip to the plate. The visitors pummeled Cornell’s pitching staff to the tune of six runs on four hits. Half of the innings’ runs came in to score when sophomore catcher Lindey Kneib smacked a home run to left-center. The round-tripper was Kneib’s second on the season, matching the totals of Lockhart and sophomore Olivia Giaquinto. Harvard is second in the Ivy League with 11 home runs, and its pitching staff has allowed the fewest with five.
Due to the eight-run rule, the game came to a close after the bottom of the fifth, as Duncan struck out Big Red second baseman Sarah Murray for the final out. Duncan evened up her record to 7-7 on the weekend, and the junior now has a 2.86 ERA in 16 appearances on the season.
CORNELL 6, HARVARD 2
Cornell starter Lisa Nelson came out firing in game one on Sunday, tossing seven frames of two-run ball and effectively silencing the Crimson’s bats in the Ithaca cold. The sophomore tallied eight strikeouts, and only one of the runs she conceded was earned. The eight punch outs were the most in any game for Harvard’s batters this season.
Through four and a half innings, it was pitchers’ duel between Nelson and Duncan. Despite allowing seven hits and a walk through four innings pitched, Duncan managed to evade major danger and only allowed two runs. However, Duncan led off the bottom of the fifth by allowing a ground-rule double to Cornell second baseman Rebecca Kubena. Coach Jenny Allard went to the bullpen, and the home half of the fifth subsequently became a huge rally inning for the Big Red. By the time the dust had settled, Cornell had broken the game wide open by tacking five runs onto the scoreboard.
The top of the seventh started well for the Crimson, as senior Melissa Lacro rocketed a double up the middle and took third on a wild pitch. Alexa Altchek followed with a single down the third base line. After the Big Red recorded one out, Kaplan ripped a single down the line in right field to bring in Lacro.
In its last chance at a comeback, Harvard had a rally going but was unable to prolong it. Just as soon as it had started, Cornell pulled the plug by spinning two up the middle on a grounder from junior third baseman Meagan Lantz.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, Harvard fencing sent fencers from both the men’s and women’s team to the NCAA Championships and walked away with an individual championship title in men’s sabre, an individual third place finish in women’s epee, as well as a fifth place overall team finish. At the championships, taken place at Penn State, the Crimson sent two fencers in the men’s sabre category, two in men’s foil, one in men’s epee, two in women’s sabre, one in women’s foil, and two in women’s epee.
“Overall the team had a really strong showing in the tournament this year,” junior Gabrielle Tartakovsky. “We were only a couple bout wins behind Penn State.”
Representing the Harvard women’s team were senior co-captain MacKenzie Lawrence in foil, junior Gabrielle Tartakovsky in sabre, sophomore Marta Lasota in sabre, and freshmen Saanchi Kukadia and Cindy Gao both in epee. The men’s fencing team was represented by junior co-captain Eli Dershwitz in sabre, sophomores George Haglund and Erwin Cai in foil and sabre respectively, and freshman Geoffrey Tourette and Charles Horowitz in foil and epee respectively.
The Crimson came into the NCAA Championships on a high note, with both Kukadia on the women’s team and Tourette on men’s team sweeping their fields to earn a gold medal each in epee and foil respectively at the 2018 NCAA Regional Tournament two weeks earlier at Brandeis University. The Manhasset, NY native won the epee category after posting a 17-6 record with a plus-36 touch differential. The Cupertino, CA native claimed the foil category with a 20-3 record and plus-66 touch differential.
“In general, the NCAA is a tournament requires a lot of psychological preparation,” Tartakovsky said. “You have a tournament with 24 of the top fencers i the country.”
On top of the two gold medals, Dershwitz came into the Championships looking to claim the men’s sabre crown for the second year in a row, with his first last year being Harvard’s first men’s individual title since 2007. The junior co-captain came into the Championships with a 47-6 record as well as claiming an individual championship title in the sabre category at the Ivy League Championships earlier this season. The Sherborn, MA, native battled his way in a 15-9 victory against Andrew Mackewicz of Penn State before defeating Ziad Elsissy of Wayne State in a nail biting 15-14 win.
Cai competed in his men’s sabre event at the NCAA Championships as a freshman to secure a 8th place finish during the Championships with 14 victories. In men’s foil, Haglund finished in 16th place. Horowitz, as the only Crimson competitor in men’s epee, to earn a 13th place finish.
On the women’s side of the events, Gao started off shaky, but was able to rebound.
“In the first round of the five-touch bouts, I really was not fencing well,” Gao said. “Those low scoring  bouts are very uncommon.”
After making the semifinals, Gao ended up earning the top finish for Harvard with a third place finish in the epee category with 17 victories.
“I started loosening up and that helped me fence a lot better,” Gao said. “For the rest of the bouts I was beating people I had never beaten before. I was carrying that energy with me throughout the entire day.”
Kukadia earned a 18th place finish in the epee category with 8 victories. Lasota, with 13 victories, and Tartakovsky, with 12 victories, finished 12th and 15th in the women’s sabre category respectively. Lawrence, the only Crimson competitor in the foil category, earned a 21st place finish in the event.
At the end of the NCAA Championships, Harvard finished as a team in 5th place with a total of 129 points and 865 touches scored, and walked away with an individual championship title thanks to Dershwitz as well as strong finishes on both the men’s and women’s teams.
The NCAA Championships conclude the season for the Harvard team, but not everyone has completed fencing on the year. Tourette, Cai, and Gao will be heading to the World Championships in Italy next week.
“NCCA is usually the end of the season for college fencers,” Gao said. “NCAA really prepared me for World this week.”

We told the Quadlings why they need a River Daddy, but it’s not just Quad folk who need refuge—there are plenty of reasons why you River dwellers should get yourself a Quad Daddy.
The Weekend Sleepover
When you’re smashed at a party in Cabot Aquarium and it’s 3 a.m., how are you going to get home? Walking? Ew. Uber? Not everyone has that kind of money. It’s much easier to sleep over at your Quad Daddy’s house than make that awful trek back. Plus, most Quad kids have singles, meaning Quad Daddy doesn’t need to ask permission from a roommate.
The Shuttle Avoidance
It’s Friday. Do you really want to get on the shuttle to go back to the river? That never-actually-running phantom train that may or may not exist? The one that consistently contains strange characters and drunk freshmen? That’s what I thought. You’re lazy and you know it. Might as well stay there for the weekend.
Pfoho Daddy
House guinea pigs? Orthography? Massage chairs? Use your Pfoho Daddy to stage weekend getaways where you walk around Pfoho in a robe looking like French royalty, while gazing upon Quad residents like they’re the Parisian peasantry. Just be careful to not let them cut off your head... Let your Pfoho Daddy guide you through the wilderness.
Cabot Daddy
Slide into Cabot and you also have an in with Rakesh. He’ll rap Hamilton for you. He’ll waive your sanctions. What more could you possibly ask for? Your Cabot Daddy and the rest of Cabot's are  pluses too.
Currier Daddy
Currier. Has. Segways. The only reason you need to find a Currier Daddy is to gain access to those coveted gifts from paradise. Plus, their mascot is Woody the Tree, so you can really easily ask your Currier Daddy to show you Woody *winks*.
So call all your friends that you know in the Qua... oh, right. You know no one in the Quad. Better get to some parties up there. Get yourself a Quad Daddy.
