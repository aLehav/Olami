What does it mean to be Asian-American and proud? SAT practice tests and avocado tteokbokki are two of the many things that come together to tackle this question in “The East Side,” an original musical that ran in Farkas Hall from April 11 to 14 under the direction of KeeHup A. Yong ’19. Put on by Harvard Asian Student Arts Project (Harvard ASAP), the show follows a 17-year-old boy named Ryan Chen (Jason Yoo ’21) struggling to reconcile his Chinese identity with his passion for art, amidst New York City’s swiftly gentrifying Chinatown. It is the essential bildungsroman, full of heart and humor, as Ryan struggles to accept his Chinese heritage even as he feels excluded because of his differences. With its powerful ideas of gentrification, family, and identity, along with incredibly catchy and unique music and set design, “The East Side” is a fun and heartwarming production.
The musical focuses on Ryan, the only son of Ms. Chen (Bo Young Choi ’17), a single mother and the owner of Chen’s Dumpling House. He and his two best friends Patrick (Phiroze K. Parasnis ’21) and Vera (Ramona Park ’22) hang out in his mother’s empty restaurant and go to SAT practice sessions, spending their days getting ready for college. One day, Ryan meets Michelle (Rocket Claman ’21) and just like a “guy from the movies,” as Vera so aptly states at one point, he falls in love with her. His romance with Michelle, along with the Dumpling House’s impending eviction and his desire to escape the East Side, all come to a head and force him to confront his values and decide what he truly believes in.
Much of the liveliness of the musical come from its set design and music, both of which shined onstage. Various building signs describing the setting hung behind the actors, written in Chinese and Korean. The colorful backdrop added a rush of energy to the theater, and each scene change came with a different prop or sign, equal in vibrancy. The crowning feature of set design[,] however, was the Chen’s family truck. What served in the beginning as the sign for the Chen family restaurant and a space for Ryan’s art was ultimately able to combine both the dumpling house — a connection to his culture and history — and his passion for art, a beautiful representation of joining the past and the future of Ryan’s life.
The accompanying music was no less impressive. A small ensemble occupied the back right of the stage, providing a wide range of instrumentation to accompany each performance. During one of Ryan’s SAT practice exams, the upbeat and fun-filled music exuded a light and simple aura as students sang out their frustrations. When a famous chef announced her goal to “help” (read: gentrify) a Chinatown restaurant, actors vocalized eerie notes alongside soft, jarrying chords. The lyrics of the songs themselves were equally evocative, catchy, and easy to follow.
Set design and music underscored the writing of the musical, driving the story. Co-writers Julia H. Riew ’21, John Lim ’20, and Jared Leong (a student at Emerson College) wove together intricate themes of family, culture, and passion as Ryan questions his identity and struggles with his pride in being Chinese throughout the entirety of the play. Chen’s Dumpling House and the dumpling itself highlight Ryan’s journey. When he first meets Michelle, he throws in the fact that dumplings “have 1000 years of history” as a way to grab her attention. His mother uses the same phrase towards the end of the musical, this time with much more emotion behind it. The change in meaning, even in this one short phrase, illustrates the depth and emotion of each character and the multiple meanings of being Asian American.
For all its incredible production value and plot, “The East Side” could have made more use of its secondary characters. Their obligatory bubble tea mentions and personalities exaggerate the overall message, and characters like Michelle, Ms. Chen’s friends, and at times even Patrick and Vera are funny but rarely insightful. It is Choi’s performance towards the end that redeems this oversight. In a truly touching scene, Ryan’s mother finally teaches him how to make dumplings, belting high notes perfectly and powerfully delivering line after line with emotions that feel real and true. She tells Ryan that the Dumpling House was never her dream; she wanted to travel and escape the world she lived in her whole life as well. “Ryan, my dream is for you to have that option," she says. "The choice to do whatever you wish to do with your life.” Choi strongly holds her gaze as she asserts each word loudly and clearly, her body posture expressing wisdom and love, strength and determination. It is easily the highlight of the entire musical.
People struggle their whole lives to understand what it means to live in America as an Asian and to be Asian American. In its careful construction and heartfelt attention to detail, “The East Side” delivers the right punchlines and messages to convince the audience that there is power and hope in the struggle of understanding who you are and where you come from, even if it does take a bit of time.

At first glance, Cage the Elephant seems like just another moderately popular indie band with a catchy name, the kind that sits on the back burner of our collective memory until they release new material to remind us that they exist. But on their latest album, “Social Cues,” the band transcends a mere reassertion of their existence. Although they invoke the invariant archetypes of their past albums, Cage the Elephant isn’t recycling old work mindlessly. On “Social Cues,” the band successfully combines their signature sound with a insightful and vulnerable examination of how exhaustion – with relationships, with careers, with oneself – inevitably manifests and piles up.
Midlife crises deserve their own soundtrack, and Cage the Elephant rightfully rises to the occasion to prove it on their fifth album. The opening track, “Broken Boy,” sets a mood of dissatisfaction for the entire record. The song’s distorted introduction quickly segues into an '80s-style chorus and verse over a driving tempo and punchy chords that are reminiscent of Billy Idol’s “White Wedding.” Frontman Matt Shultz asks rhetorical questions that foreshadow the cloud of dissatisfaction hovering over the rest of the album. He laments, “Tell me why I’m forced to live in this skin," inviting the listener to wonder what’s so bad about the skin he’s in.
Yet we don’t have to wonder for long. The titular “Social Cues” portrays fame as an exhaustible pleasure, one that Shultz desires to escape from, but cannot. It focuses on the tension between the perceived allure and the actualized pain of fame when it becomes reality. Lines like “Hide me in the back room / tell me when it's over / Don't know if I can play this part much longer” and “People always say, man, at least you’re on the radio” embody the dissonance between the two sides of fame – being famous and desiring fame. Finding fame exhausting isn’t a particularly innovative theme, but the difference with “Social Cues” is that the irritation toward fame is consistent throughout the entire album, showing up again in songs like “Black Madonna” and “Skin and Bones,” which allows for Shultz’s message to be digested more wholeheartedly.
On “Social Cues,” Cage the Elephant documents the impermanence of relationships. Complementary songs “Goodbye” and “Ready To Let Go” appear to document Shultz’s recent divorce, each describing how relationships once regarded as impenetrable are not immune to the wear of everyday life. “Ready to Let Go” aches for separation, and its cocky guitar riffs convey a confident attitude toward separation and its motives. In direct contrast, “Goodbye” starts with soft, vulnerable piano chords, channeling the somber paradox of separation: feeling visceral, residual pain towards divorce despite its necessity. Lyrics like, “Held on too tight / you know I tried / but in the end it left me paralyzed,” are a testament to how the effects of holding on may be worse than letting go, but letting go is still perceived as a last resort. Portrayed through these two songs, the duality of separation makes frustration with exhaustible pleasures accessible to those who may not relate to the tedium of fame.
Amidst bemoaning these exhaustible pleasures, there are a few moments of mindful reprieve. “Love’s the Only Way” is a symphonic masterpiece that is quite distinct from the bass-and-percussion heavy songs on the rest of the album. It’s also a demonstration of Shultz’s vocal range, showcasing his ability to be ethereal and not just gritty or nasal. It searches beyond this exhaustion described in the other songs, toying with the idea that there is perhaps, somewhere, inexhaustible love. This optimism, a smart addition to the album, offers the hope that in a world of diminishing pleasures, there are flickers of fulfillment.
As an album, “Social Cues” takes on the feat of describing both the tiresome anguish of fame alongside failed relationships, albeit with intermittent bouts of hope. The combination of the band’s signature punchy instrumentals with despondently introspective lyrics make “Social Cues” a genuine but not hopeless lament, rather than a subtle flex of fame – a refreshingly honest perspective in an age that glorifies the presentation of personal success above all else.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike other universities, Harvard supports an elaborate House system rather than that of traditional dormitories. I’ve always found the analogy to be comforting. Even if I am 3,000 miles away from home, I can still say that I live in a House, which is also within a neighborhood. The people in your House essentially become your second family, ranging from your blockmates to your fellow d-hall dwellers, and this extends to your Resident Tutors. To be a tutor, then, means to commit to a significant role in fostering House community. It means filling in the large shoes of a mentor, advisor, point of contact, and confidante.
At the most superficial level, tutors may serve as academic advisors. Sure, when I’m debating whether to switch my concentration, I can talk to a tutor in Eliot about my evolving academic interests and seek out advice. But what about the fact that I will live in the same House with this person for three years? What about all the times we’ve sat together for dinner or the times I’ve played with her children? Given the close ties between House members, can tutors ever be considered  just academic advisors?
The boundary between the resident tutor’s role as an advisor and a friend is a hazy and undefined blur. So many students have developed genuine bonds with their house tutors. In these relationships, emotion and wisdom are interwoven until they are practically indistinguishable. Such complex relationships, however, come with a stark difference in power. As friendly or giving as tutors may be, they are still staff members with the ability to impact an undergraduate student’s academic trajectory at Harvard. As such, they must realize the implications and consequences behind all their actions.
When a tutor hurts or negatively harms a student, the consequences spread like wildfire, destroying a House from within its wooden framework. As members of the House community, tutors should be cognizant of the sensitivity of their roles in the lives of undergraduates. Tutors ultimately possess greater leverage than students in the power dynamic and therefore have the power to either escalate or deescalate a situation. If you are a tutor, then I urge you to ask yourself: What are your motivations for taking on this role? Do you have the commitment and dedication to the House community to handle the responsibilities and maturity that come with guiding the rocky lives of students?
Undoubtedly, tutors are a point of support and empathy for their students, but this role should not stop outside the walls of a House. The Harvard network is strong and resilient, and everyone in the Harvard community is connected to some degree. When a student was forcibly arrested by Cambridge Police Department officers, we all felt the tide of the effects. When a student created history and transcended the limitations placed by his country, we watched and celebrated his success.
So when the delicate trust between a student and a tutor is broken and replaced with strategic targeting and hostility, the incident no longer becomes isolated within the fences of Winthrop House.
The responsibility of tutors, then, entails being a figure of guidance, support, and understanding for all undergraduate students, not just those of their House. A student should not have to feel afraid to approach a tutor or anticipate a negative interaction of such magnitude, for the actions of one tutor can irrevocably affect the perception of the others. This is an immense responsibility to shoulder, one that comes with pressure and the need for careful judgment. But it is necessary for the health of our community, and those whose hearts understand the gravity of their impact are perhaps the ones most fit for the role.

Harvard often bills itself as primarily a liberal arts institution, focused more on pedagogy and character-building than directly supporting students’ pre-professional ambitions. The College’s mission statement even includes a goal to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders of our society,” and many concentrations do not directly correspond to a clear pre-professional focus. While these aims are noble and integral to the academic vitality of our community, we are encouraged to see the success of the Harvard Teacher Fellows program, which has addressed an important and necessary gap in the pre-professional resources this campus does offer.
Harvard often belies its stated liberal arts focus through institutions which create and support direct pre-professional pathways. The “recruiting” timeline for jobs and internships in fields like finance, consulting, and technology is well-known to students, many of whom rely upon programs like the Office of Career Services’ Campus Interview Program to secure positions after college. In contrast, students interested in jobs and internships in public service lack the same kind of breadth and well-developed structure as their consulting or finance-oriented peers. While there is nothing wrong with having these pre-professional pathways per se, Harvard must do more to acknowledge the impact of their disproportionate primacy over other pre-professional pathways on our campus. The University should attempt to support those students who wish to pursue public service careers by strengthening analogous pre-professional pathways that will provide them a similar structure.
On that front, HTF — a Harvard-based teacher training and education program — is a strikingly positive development. It affords students interested in teaching with an opportunity to spend time in high-need urban classrooms, and instills in them valuable skills necessary to become successful teachers if they continue in that career. This kind of institutionalization is much needed. According to OCS surveys, since 2012, the proportion of graduates entering educational careers has ranged from 2 to 7 percent — much lower than the proportions of students entering finance or technology, for instance.
Teaching as a profession is tragically underappreciated and underpaid in this country. Good educators have the potential to shape their students’ lives for the better, especially in under-resourced communities. It is unfortunate that the income differential between education and other industries poses a significant barrier to students looking to pursue teaching as a career after graduation. HTF’s work to produce a more established procedural framework for interested students and reduce any stigma associated with teaching as a career is praiseworthy. We fear many promising potential teachers will not consider that path due to financial considerations, which is understandable. Nevertheless, we hope more students who are educationally inclined do take advantage of this program to better serve their students and the communities in which they teach.
We have previously spoken about public service, and the University’s stated commitment to these careers. In his October installation address, University President Lawrence S. Bacow demonstrated a commitment to supporting public service across Harvard. These statements and actions of support must go further, raising enough capital and committing enough resources to ensure that public service-interested students are on comparable financial footing to students pursuing other careers. In this vein, we hope that HTF, as a relatively new program, receives more financial support to bolster it for years to come.
As the program becomes more established, students should view HTF and related programs as serious, self-contained life paths and consider teaching as a full-time career, rather than as a mere stepping-stone. While we understand that teaching is not a profession for everyone, one benefit of the flexible time commitment to HTF is the opportunity for students to gauge their own desire to pursue education as a career. We are excited by the promise of this program, and are grateful for the opportunities it presents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Easter weekend was more meaningful to me than it has ever been before. I felt the heaviness of what Jesus Christ’s death on the cross and resurrection did for me as a Christian. When I was younger, it was easy to associate Easter with bunnies, colorful eggs, scavenger hunts, and holiday-themed chocolate because of mainstream culture. Even as I became more aware of my faith growing up, the catchy phrase “He is risen” and the images, songs, and even the joy that came with it was as shallow as practicing religion can be. But, it wasn’t until I truly encountered God halfway through college and began to develop a personal relationship with Him that the message of Easter — unsolicited grace extended to me, a sinner — started to sink in deeper.
Transitioning from religion to relationship, however, is far from an instantaneous process. If you asked me what I did for Easter last year, I would not be able to tell you — though I probably attended church. What I do remember from last spring was barely keeping my head above water as I managed Chemistry 27: “Organic Chemistry of Life”, Physical Science 3: “Electromagnetism, Circuits, Waves, Optics, and Imaging”, and Applied Math 21b: “Mathematical Methods in the Sciences” at the same time. But now, little by little, all that seemed important has lost its significance in comparison. The story of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection is the bedrock of my faith. It is the absolute truth which Christians should build their lives on. With that mindset, as I looked around on Easter Sunday, I was excited to see an energy around campus uncharacteristic of most early mornings and afternoons right before the school week begins again. It was refreshing. But, as a Harvard student or even just young person myself in this day and age, I was able to look deeper and see past the superficial mask many of us put on for such an occasion.
How many of us are still experiencing our faith as that shallow feeling of piety?
For some of us, being Christian is just one aspect of our identity that can easily be minimized and maximized to suit our surroundings. In a college environment, it is easy to blend in with the crowd for the sake of social capital, experiencing new things, and enjoying our youth. At Harvard especially, we are encouraged to live a life here on earth that leaves a lasting legacy, but this does not account for our eternity. Our excitement about Easter is only as impactful as what our lives tell people. Do we live like we believe in His death? How can we point to the loving sacrifice of our Lord and Savior as something to live by when nothing distinguishes our lives from others?
I, too, am far from perfect in this, but I like to believe I am progressing by God’s grace. Three years ago, I wrote my first Crimson op-ed on reconciling Christianity with college life. Looking back on it, I can’t help but smile in amusement at that stage of my life. Still wide-mouthed and starry-eyed at being at a place like Harvard, carrying my strong, Christian upbringing on my shoulders, I was trying to figure out how this Christian “thing” would work in college. While my resolve then was to stand firm behind my beliefs, the word “reconciling” gave me away. To reconcile means to cause to coexist in harmony or to make compatible, but the Christian faith was never supposed to coexist harmoniously or be compatible with college life. It is supposed to pierce through confusion and challenge what is accepted as the mainstream college experience. It is supposed to be all-consuming and dominant over everything else in a person’s life. This may sound scary, but it is in fact liberating.
Knowing the basis of my identity is in Christ allows me to escape some of the struggles of college life born out of searching for validation and contentment. What I am unable to escape, due to my imperfect nature, an eternally-focused mindset quickly puts those struggles into perspective. More importantly, all the things, like a perfect GPA and numerous extracurricular commitments, that vy for attention and seem to hold such great significance realign themselves under God’s purpose for my life.
Harvard does not have to be the place where faith is placed on hold while we develop the rest of ourselves as individuals, and it surely does not have to strip us of our faith completely. This place will challenge and test our Christianity just as it does everything else we believe to be true. Even as we work through what we encounter, compartmentalizing Christianity to baseless religious practice, if that, only does a disservice to ourselves and the world around us, not to mention the author and finisher of our faith. Living like we believe in Jesus Christ’s death on the cross and resurrection, that broke the bondage of sin and religious legalism, means living a life that is set apart. It means taking everything that is thrown at us and, regardless of the environment we find ourselves in, refusing to reconcile our Christian faith with it but rather allowing our faith to be the foundation of our lives from which we function daily.

The Faculty Council voted to approve updates to the student handbook and change the name of the Systems Biology Ph.D. program at its final meeting of the semester Wednesday.
The Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences highest governing body — also approved preliminary lists of courses in FAS and the Harvard Extension School for the 2019-2020 academic year. The body passed all four proposals without contention, according to Council member David L. Howell.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana presented the proposed changes to the student handbook. Howell said the updates were “routine” and reflected items the Faculty has voted upon this year that impact undergraduates.
“The changes reflected changes that have already been approved by the Faculty, like the M.A. — the concurrent bachelor's-master's program — and things like that, the various changes that we've made over the year,” Howell said.
The concurrent degree program, which the full Faculty approved in March, replaces the College’s Advanced Standing Program as a new option for undergraduates to earn both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in four years. Students starting with the Class of 2022 will be eligible for the program.
The Council also voted to change the name of the Standing Committee on Higher Degrees in Systems Biology to the Standing Committee on Higher Degrees in Systems, Synthetic, and Quantitative Biology, Howell said.
The program — which is run by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and draws faculty from FAS and Harvard Medical School — does not plan to change the content of the program along with the new name, Howell said in an interview earlier this month. Instead, faculty in the program intend to change the name so that the name better reflects the nature of faculty and students’ research work.
The Council’s decision on the name change is final, according to Howell.
“That's something that the Faculty Council can do on its own authority, so it will be reported to the FAS Faculty but not voted on,” he said.
FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke presented the preliminary list of next year’s FAS courses to the Council on behalf of FAS Dean Claudine Gay, while Extension School Dean Huntington D. Lambert presented his school’s list. Both lists remain subject to change as departments continue to finalize their course plans for next year, according to Howell.
The Council’s decisions on the handbook and the two course lists were purely advisory, however. The full Faculty will vote upon the three items at its upcoming May 7 meeting.

Harvard students clad in denim — some from head to toe — gathered throughout the day Wednesday in Science Center Plaza to show their solidarity for people who have experienced sexual assault.
The annual event, celebrated around the world since 1998, was hosted at Harvard by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators.
The campaign arose after the Italian Supreme Court overturned a rape conviction in 1998 after it concluded that a woman’s jeans were too tight for the alleged perpetrator to remove without her consent, according to an emailed statement by OSAPR Director Pierre R. Berastaín Ojeda ’10.
“The following day, the women in the Italian Parliament came to work wearing jeans in solidarity with the victim,” Berastaín wrote. “Denim Day is a response to this case and a statement of the international activism that it sparked.”
In the days leading up to the event, Harvard affiliates had the opportunity to sign a solidarity pledge through a Google form circulated over campus email lists. The form prompted students to indicate their affiliation with different student organizations and teams and to write a personal pledge.
Campaign organizers handed out stickers to participants throughout the afternoon, and teams and clubs met up throughout the day to take pictures together in their denim at a booth near the Science Center. Attendees also played games, ate ice cream, and participated in giveaways.
Last year, more than 800 affiliates pledged solidarity and roughly 1,000 people attended the event, according to Berastaín.
CARE Tutor Janani Krishnan-Jha ’20 said she believes it is important to actively support and stand in solidarity with people who have experienced sexual and gender-based violence and harassment.
“I think that is really important that every year we have organizations come forward and voice their support so that moving forward we set a tone and precedent that these kinds of actions are not something that Harvard condones and are actually condemned,” she said.
Larry Dang ’22, who dressed in denim and stopped by the booth Wednesday afternoon, said that the campaign is important for bringing visibility to the cause.
“In so far as it is not meant to forward an agenda but rather to forward a culture and forward a sense of support,” Dang said.
“Once you achieve a critical mass, that begins to turn tides in being able to make people feel comfortable in situations where they need to come forward and express experiences with sexual violence,” Dang added.
While Dang was taking a picture with members of a capella group the Vertiones who were all dressed in denim, Missy Dreier ’19 grabbed a sticker on her way to class.
“I just came to get a sticker because I’ve been wearing all denim and I definitely wanted to make clear that that’s the reason and, like, in support of this cause,” Dreier said.
Hope Y. Kudo ’22 said she appreciated the number of people who came out to support the campaign.
“I think that it is really great that a lot of people came together to, like, support this cause especially cause, like, it’s such a salient thing that’s happening right now,” she said. “I think it’s really important that we bring like awareness to it.”

Professor of Public Policy David J. Deming was named the faculty director of the Kennedy School’s Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy, the school announced Wednesday.

In his new position, Deming — who also serves as a professor of education and economics at the Graduate School of Education — succeeds former Kennedy School Dean David J. Ellwood, who has held the position since 2016. Ellwood is currently a professor of political economy at the Kennedy School.

Deming’s research focuses on labor and education economics. He founded Collegiate Leaders in Increasing MoBility — CLIMB — initiative, a research partnership aiming to foster social advancement through institutions of higher education. Deming also serves as a research principal for the Opportunity Insights institute, an organization developed by economist Raj Chetty ’00 to work on reducing economic inequality in America.

Deming won the David Kershaw Award and Prize for his work in the fields of public policy and management. The prize is given to prominent individuals in these fields and are under the age of 40.

Deming said in a press release that he is “honored” to contribute to the Center’s work and scholarship.

“For three decades, the Malcolm Wiener Center has been at the nexus of some of the most important social policy debates in this country,” Deming said. “I am honored by the chance to serve the Wiener Center’s proud tradition of improving public policy and practice through scholarship, teaching, mentoring, and outreach.”
The Malcolm Wiener Center — founded in 1988 — produces research on social inequality and domestic policy. Faculty affiliated with the Center include Professor of Public Policy Amitabh Chandra, Professor of History, Race, and Public Policy Khalil G. Muhammad, and Professor of Political Leadership and Democratic Values Jane J. Mansbridge.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf lauded Deming’s credentials in the press release Wednesday.

“We are extremely fortunate that David has agreed to direct the Wiener Center at Harvard Kennedy School,” Elmendorf wrote. “David’s outstanding scholarship at the intersection of public policy, economics, and education—and especially his work on education as a means to increase social mobility—make him an ideal leader for the center.”
Elmendorf also praised Ellwood as he prepares to depart from the faculty director position.
“David Ellwood has led the Wiener Center with great judgment and dedication during the past three years, as he led the entire Kennedy School during the preceding years as dean,” Elmendorf wrote. “All of us at the Kennedy School are in his debt.”

Deming will begin in his new post on July 1.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview Tuesday that he has met with students advocating for the University’s divestment from fossil fuels and companies with ties to the prison industry and that he supports their right to engage in activism — including through protest.
Khurana said he supports student protests when they are combined with other forms of activism, such as direct dialogue. His comments come weeks after University President Lawrence S. Bacow criticized a group of protesters calling for divestment after their protest interrupted an event at which he was speaking at Harvard Kennedy School.
“I think protest is an important part of our democratic tradition. And I'm pleased to see our students engage in a variety of different ways, including protest, which is one form of expression,” Khurana said.
“I also think that protest in combination with other approaches that lead to educating, awareness, organizing, developing along the sort of notions of reasoned argument, appeals to values, and appeals to reason are often critical for actually long term change in society,” he added.
Khurana’s comments come in the middle of “Heat Week” — a week-long protest calling on Bacow and other Harvard administrators to divest endowment holdings from the fossil fuel industry. Divest Harvard — a fossil fuel divestment advocacy group — organized the series of panels, speeches, and demonstrations.
Heat Week is only the most recent effort in several months of divestment activism. Earlier this semester, prison and fossil fuel divestment organizers held rallies in Harvard Yard and coordinated petitions that have earned support from many Harvard affiliates. Activists have also met in person with Bacow. At a meeting with prison divestment activists, Bacow told them he responds to “reason,” not “demands.”
In line with the past several University presidents, Bacow has repeatedly rejected the idea that Harvard’s endowment should be used to promote social change.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain previously reiterated this position in an email to The Crimson.
“The University’s position, as it has stated previously, is that it should not use the endowment to achieve political ends, or particular policy ends,” Swain wrote.
Khurana said he believes students and Harvard officials should continue to engage in “dialogue” with each other on divestment.
“I'm in agreement with our student leaders, our President, University leaders, that the most important thing that our community can do is engage in dialogue,” Khurana said. “Dialogue allows for perspective taking. Dialogue allows people to ask informed questions. It assumes the best of each other's intentions.”
The University last divested a portion of its holdings in 1990. That year, the Corporation announced that Harvard would divest its stocks from tobacco-related companies. Khurana said that while divestment falls outside his domain, he would like the College to examine how it can become more sustainable.
Khurana suggested a series of changes he thinks the College should make, including incorporating readings about climate change and the prison system into freshman orientation, making dining hall menus more sustainable, and encouraging students to use bikes instead of motorized vehicles.
“Within the College, there's a lot of things that we can do, I think, to be an example of what a thoughtful, responsible community looks like,” Khurana said. “How can we think about the readings that we choose? How can we think about some practices that we introduce in our residential houses? I think there’s an opportunity, as well, to think about what kind of courses that we could create, that are transdisciplinary, that are more problem-driven.”
Khurana also said he has met with “students who are interested in the fossil fuel divestment area” this semester.
Asked whether he has an opinion about whether the University should divest from fossil fuels or prisons, Khurana said he does, but declined to share it.
“I think it's important, in my role, to keep those views personal,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six months into contract negotiations — and three months after Harvard and its graduate student union have agreed on a tentative proposal — a union-proposed grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints remains the center of contention.
HGSU has proposed that in instances of discrimination or harassment against members of its bargaining unit, the University must respond to the grievance within a set period of time. If the union deems the University’s response unsatisfactory, it can allege that the contract has been violated and request to move into third-party arbitration to resolve the matter.
The union has argued that Harvard’s current Title IX procedures — the processes by which Harvard enforces the federal anti-discrimination law — cannot be objective because the investigative office is affiliated with the University. They also argue their proposal would protect student workers from a wider range of discriminatory behaviors.
The University has rejected the union’s proposal, maintaining that student workers should pursue complaints through the University’s internal procedures. A third-party grievance procedure would create “adversarial processes for HGSU-UAW members,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote to Harvard affiliates in an emailed bargaining update last week.
At the heart of the conflict is whether third-party arbitration would necessarily require cross-examination between the person alleging discrimination and the alleged perpetrator, and whether Harvard could enforce findings or decisions made by an outside party.
Shelley B. Kroll, the legal counsel for HGSU, wrote in an emailed statement that the proposed grievance procedure would not necessarily require “face-to-face confrontation.”
“The Union could request sequestration when the survivor testifies, and if Harvard is concerned for the survivor, they could agree,” Kroll wrote. “If Harvard would not agree, the arbitrator would make the decision.”
Sequestration can take on many forms, but broadly involves avoiding face-to-face confrontations.
Former National Labor Relations Board Chairman William B. Gould IV said that while arbitration typically “requires both examination and cross-examination,” there has been a “great deal of dispute” when it comes to university union grievance procedures.
“It's quite possible that some kind of modification could be fashioned to deal with this problem,” Gould said. “This is really new, uncharted territory. The general rule is, you have the right to confront your accuser.”
Gould said that arbitrators can choose to sequester witnesses, but this typically occurs to ensure the “authenticity of individual witnesses,” not because of the case’s sensitivity.
Vice President of Labor, Employment and Elections at the American Arbitration Association Ann S. Lesser said that standard arbitration procedures do typically include cross-examination.
Still, she said labor grievance procedures are customizable to each contract and that HGSU could avoid cross-examination by requesting meditation instead of arbitration, for example.
“It all depends on what the parties have agreed to,” Lesser said.
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers — which represents more than 5,000 Harvard employees who primarily work in libraries, labs, and faculty offices — uses a grievance process involving binding mediation rather than arbitration, according to its contract.
HUCTW President Carrie E. Barbash said that her union believes arbitration is not “productive for actually resolving the issue.”
“We definitely don't use cross-examination in our procedure, and we feel like our procedure has been very effective,” Barbash said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that HGSU has not proposed “anything like” mediation.
Harvard has also raised concerns about its inability to be governed by third-party arbitration. University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview earlier this month that a third-party arbitrator would have no legal authority to discipline anyone outside of the union’s bargaining unit.
HGSU bargaining committee member Ege Yumusak ’16 wrote in an email that HGSU’s proposed grievance procedure is not meant to discipline the accused party, but rather to hold the University accountable to non-discrimination policies.
“If an arbitrator finds that Harvard has maintained a discriminatory work environment, or if the arbitrator finds that a student worker has been subjected to harassment, then the arbitrator can order a change to the work environment to ensure that, going forward, the student worker can work and study in an environment free from harassment or discrimination,” Yumusak wrote.
Several university student worker contracts across the country include discrimination grievance procedures, including the University of Connecticut and the University of Washington.
David K. Parsons, president of UAW Local 4121, the graduate student union at the University of Washington, said his university did not “kick up a big fuss” about discrimination grievance procedures during initial contract negotiations in 2004.
“They also acknowledge that this is a process that is fair, it doesn't have to be at the exclusion of other internal university processes,” Parsons said.
University of Connecticut Graduate Employee Union President Mary H. Bugbee said that her union had to work to convince its university to agree these grievance procedures, but they ultimately did.
Swain wrote that, despite other schools’ contracts, Harvard does not believe grievance is an “appropriate” way to pursue discrimination and sexual harassment claims.
“Not all contracts between universities and graduate students unions allow for grievance and arbitration of sexual harassment and discrimination claims – including not all UAW contracts,” Swain wrote.
Swain also wrote that the University’s internal procedures are “specifically designed to meet the legal obligations the University has under Title IX.”
“It is not at all clear that the arbitration process proposed by HGSU-UAW would be the sort of prompt and equitable resolution process that Title IX requires universities provide,” Swain wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks after concluding its regular season, No. 16 Harvard (20-6, 3-3 CWPA) is set to travel to Providence, RI. for the Collegiate Water Polo Association conference tournament hosted by Brown University.
Holding the fourth seed in the tournament, the Crimson is looking at a matchup with the Bears (19-12, 2-4) on Friday, marking the second time that the teams meet this season. In the season’s first contest, Harvard edged out a victory with a go-ahead goal with 3:03 left in the final period of play. That Cambridge showdown was the first conference game for both teams in the 2019 campaign.
Brown is coming into the tournament hot, having won four of its last five matches, with its only loss coming against No. 15 ranked Princeton, the second seed in this weekend’s tournament. Hoping to work off of their recent success, the Bears are looking to use their home advantage to avenge their previous conference loss to the Crimson.
However, Harvard is coming into the tournament following an excellent regular season. Defeating the likes of No. 19 San Jose State, No. 13 Fresno State, and No. 24 California Baptist, the Crimson has shown its ability to hang with West Coast power schools.
The season began with a historic start for Harvard, as the squad set a program record with a 10-0 start before losing to Princeton in overtime. Contributions from a strong freshman class and experienced upperclassman leadership have proved crucial throughout the season.
“We rely a lot on our freshmen to do a lot for us, so I think it's made them better to have that leadership from the seniors,” said head coach Ted Minnis.
The senior class—consisting of team captain Samantha Acker, defender Haley Bowe, and attacker Kristen Hong—is hoping to extend its final season in the pool for the Crimson with a successful tournament run.
“The biggest thing that we are going to need to focus on this upcoming weekend is to play our game,” said Hong, discussing the approach to the second matchup against Brown. “You do all this leading up to the game. Practice is practice, but when you're there, you just play. So hopefully things fall into place and we remember the little things from practice.”
If the Crimson repeats its first outcome against Brown on Friday, it will head to the semifinals to face top-seeded No. 6 Michigan (21-8, 6-0), a team who scored 17 goals to Harvard’s two in the Crimson’s final regular season contest. The Wolverines are the favorites to win the conference tournament after a perfect regular season conference run.
Riding a seven-game winning streak, Michigan looks to continue its solid stretch, facing the winner of the first contest having a bye in its favor. Of the games that they lost, the Wolverines have dropped most of the matchups to teams ranked in the top-five nationally: No. 1 USC, No. 2 Stanford, No. 3 Cal, and No. 4 UCLA. During the rest of the season, Michigan has put on dominating performances against their opponents, making a clear case for their seeding in the CWPA conference championship and their No. 6 national ranking.
Although the Wolverines look to make their fourth straight NCAA tournament appearance by winning the conference championship, the CWPA’s unpredictability may lead to a potential upset this year.
“I believe there's six or seven teams in our conference that have a shot of beating anybody any given day,” said Coach Minnis, reflecting on the strength of the CWPA’s teams.
Looking to be that team, the Crimson will need to stick to the style of play that has brought them 20 wins.
“It’s super easy to get bogged down trying to figure out what the other team is doing and adjust too much when sometimes you just have to figure out what you're doing, put your head down and get it done” said Hong, noting the importance of remaining consistent with what works in the face of elimination.
