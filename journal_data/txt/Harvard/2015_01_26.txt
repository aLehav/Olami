After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In November, we released a video featuring several Harvard students as they struggled to pass the 1964 Louisiana Literacy Test. While the project has received overwhelmingly positive feedback, in the comments sections of many sites across the web, several debates have been sparked in response to the video. Some commenters have questioned the comparison between literacy tests and voter identification laws and others have even questioned the purpose of this project.
With this op-ed, we hope to explain exactly why this project is so important and why the comparison between literacy tests and voter ID laws is absolutely valid.
Five decades ago, states in the American South gave literacy tests to any voter who could not “prove a fifth grade education.” In reality, the only people who ever saw this test were blacks and, to a lesser extent, working class whites. In order to pass the 1964 Louisiana Literacy Test, voters needed to answer all 30 questions correctly in 10 minutes. Just one question wrong was grounds for disenfranchisement.
While it may be disturbing to read about barriers to voting such as poll taxes and literacy tests in history books, it is an entirely different experience to stand in the shoes of a black voter who had to take this test in 1964. We asked a group of Harvard students to take the test under the conditions stipulated in the directions of the original test. Thirty questions. Ten minutes. Not a single question wrong. If anyone could pass a basic literacy test, it would be Harvard students, right?
As brilliant as the students who took this test are, none of them passed it. None of them passed because no one can pass. The 1964 Louisiana Literacy Test, like the other literacy tests given to black and poor white voters at the time, did not have a legitimate answer key. Most of the test’s questions seem purposely ambiguous. No matter what was written down, the registrar official would simply say the person’s interpretation of the question was wrong. These literacy tests were devious and instituted to disenfranchise people who had the wrong skin tone or belonged to the wrong social class.
Literacy tests and other mechanisms used to disenfranchise citizens were outlawed by the 1965 Voting Rights Act, but the primary purpose of this project is to bring attention to the fact that the sacred right to vote remains threatened. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act, empowering Southern states to change their election laws without federal oversight. Eight states have established strict voter ID laws that disproportionately prevent people of color and the poor from voting. Just last month, the Supreme Court upheld Texas’ voter ID law, which potentially disenfranchised as many as 600,000 people in the 2014 midterm elections alone.
What motivates voter ID laws today is no different from what motivated past malicious barriers to voting. Those who support voter ID laws are claiming to be sincerely guarding against voter fraud in the same way that those who supported literacy tests claimed to be issuing a legitimate test of one’s literacy. Loyola University Law School Professor Justin Levitt’s comprehensive study of over 1 billion ballots cast in general, primary, special, and municipal elections across the nation from 2000 to 2014, could only find 31 possible incidents of voter fraud.
Another study by the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School has found that the costs related to obtaining an ID to vote can range from $75 to $125, a sum that disproportionately burdens minority and working class voters. This is a cost that, when adjusted for inflation, is significantly higher than the poll tax that was explicitly established to prevent blacks and working class whites from voting. To put it simply, voter fraud is an imaginary problem being used to justify discrimination by another name.
We created this project because we want everyone to understand that the right to vote has never been guaranteed and should never be taken for granted. Lawmakers have been devising clever schemes to disenfranchise American citizens since the earliest days of this country’s founding. The voter ID law is only the most recent ploy in a long legacy of voter disenfranchisement efforts in this country’s history.
We must remain vigilant in the face of dishonest laws that are disenfranchising our fellow citizens.  The midterm election has passed, but our message remains the same. The right to vote is sacred and we all have a responsibility to protect it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I furtively slid the crimson baseball cap across the pay counter. Behind me, throats cleared as students adjusted their books and notepads. I saw the glowing parents, laden with sweatshirts, t-shirts, turtlenecks, hats, scarves, fleeces, sweaters, sweatbands and more—all designed to prominently display that one magic word: Harvard.
“Excuse me,” the lady at the register called, “are you a student here?” Am I? The real Harvard students waited behind me for their turn, many already branded with an imperious H. I looked down at the cap I had placed on the counter. It read “Harvard Extension School” on the front. Am I a Harvard student?
The Harvard Extension School is part of the Division of Continuing Education, one of the twelve Harvard University schools. It was founded in 1910 to bring Harvard courses to the Boston community, offering open enrollment and affordable tuition. For the past 100 years the Extension School has nurtured nearly half a million scholars.
It was a few years ago that I bought my Extension School cap at the Harvard Coop. I had just started at the Extension School’s Premedical Program, designed for post-college students aiming to apply to medical school. I was fond of my program and excited to represent the Extension School. Yet I soon found that my cap had a split personality.
In Boston, the Extension School is well known. Extension School posters paste the walls of the Green Line, and the Extension School Master’s programs are advertised on WBUR, Boston’s National Public Radio station. All sorts of Bostonians have tackled an Extension School course at one point or another. In the city of Harvard, my cap represents the everyman’s desire for knowledge.
But beyond Boston, many aren’t familiar with the Extension School. If I wear my cap, eyes widen. I can’t help but feel somewhat misleading. “I’m just a simple Extension School student,” I want to say, “I didn’t really get into Harvard.” In the greater world, like it or not, my Harvard cap is an emblem of elitism.
And some feel protective ownership over this emblem. One friend—a student of the real Harvard—reacted to my purchase derisively: “Did you really buy an Extension School hat?” I get it. Why buy a Harvard hat if it doesn’t symbolize a Harvard acceptance?
It’s true that Harvard-wear lets you silently inform others that a committee of people thought you were smart and interesting, something which an Extension School hat can’t necessarily say. But Harvard can also symbolize something much more powerful: A meaningful exploration of core human questions.
And Extension School students are as much a part of that exploration as any other Harvard students. They weren’t selected for the Ivy League. No one assured them of their greatness, except maybe their mothers. But in taking on Harvard University courses—with the same professors and at the same facilities as other Harvard students—Extension School students strive for knowledge at the highest level. Their striving is answered with the intellectual tools to move the world forward—the same tools gifted to all Harvard students.
My Extension School cap, well broken in by now, is a fond reminder that we can all grow in knowledge and understanding. And we don’t need the affirmations of important committees to do so. We just need the will to exercise our most important organ and to challenge ourselves continuously.
Periel Shapiro, who will be attending medical school in the fall, completed the Harvard Extension School Health Careers Program this past May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Obama omitted mention of gun control in a State of the Union address for the first time since 2012. Politically, that decision might make sense. In the past year, the United States suffered fewer widely-covered massacres involving firearms, and politicians may have been less inclined to pursue gun control for this reason. The recent shooting at Brigham & Women’s Hospital and the recent increase in Boston's gun homicide rate the homicide rate, however, highlight the fact that restricting access to firearms remains a significant public safety issue both locally and nationwide.
Stephen Pasceri of Millbury, Massachusetts, was a 55-year old married accountant with four children, no history of mental illness, and a license to carry. On Tuesday, Mr. Pasceri went to the second floor of Brigham & Women’s Hospital, asked for Michael J. Davidson, the director of endovascular cardiac surgery and an assistant at Harvard Medical School, and shot him twice before committing suicide. Dr. Davidson died in surgery. It has been suggested that Mr. Pasceri was motivated by his anger over the treatment of his mother, who died under the care of Dr. Davidson last year. This represents a case in which universal background checks and increased access to mental health resources may not have made a difference, as Mr. Pasceri was licensed. But that does not mean that there are no lessons to be learned—while mourning this tragedy, we should also examine the United States' culture of ubiquitous gun ownership.
While violent crime and shootings have declined in Boston, homicides were up 27% in 2014 as compared to the previous year, rising from 41 to 52 deaths. This marks an ominous shift in the story of gun violence in Boston and other major American cities, which had seen a widespread drop in the rate of murders over the last several years. A reversal of the previous downward trend would represent a step in the wrong direction.
Regardless of whether or not the spike in homicides in Boston is indicative of a larger trend, gun control remains a pressing issue for all Americans. Politicians must actively and continually seek to promote policies that lower the presence of guns and gun-related deaths in the United States. This tragedy—as well as the tragedies of gun violence that play out every day in our country, often to residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods—should compel us to work toward a future in which fewer families lose loved ones to gun violence.
Though it may be true that the shadow of crisis in this country has passed and the state of the union is strong—as President Obama claimed during his address last Tuesday—America’s lack of effective gun control policies remains an enduring weakness. The murder of Dr. Davidson and others in the Boston area stands testament to that damning flaw. It’s time to talk about guns again.

UPDATED: January 27, 2015, at 6:36 p.m.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, called for more equal opportunities for minority groups and a government that works for all Americans in a keynote address at a conference held at Harvard on Saturday.
“We have got to make this a country that we can believe in—a country that doesn’t just work for some of us, but a country that works for all of us,” Warren told the 500 students and alumni who attended the fourth annual "Public Interested" conference, an event that aims to help students explore postgraduate opportunities in the public sector.
Warren recounted her experience advocating for consumers, which eventually led to the establishment in 2010 of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau despite warnings of pushback from the banks facing new oversight.
“You don’t get what you don’t fight for,” she said.
Addressing the issue of racial inequality, Warren argued that home ownership is the primary way through which American families build wealth and that discriminatory practices in the housing market have resulted in persistent inequality.
“We have been running parallel economic tracks that provide different levels of opportunities for people based on their race,” she said.
When a member of the audience pointed out that the Democratic Party will be the minority party in Congress next year, Warren said she did not go to Washington to be “the most popular girl in the Senate.”
“I’m here to fight what the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sent me to fight for,” she said.
After telling several personal stories, Warren encouraged Harvard students to be open-minded and to grasp opportunities for making a difference.
“Say yes a lot, if you want to do public interest,” she said. “Don’t have such a narrow vision of what you want to do no matter how much you want to do it.”
Audience members said they were inspired by Warren’s speech, which was punctuated by frequent laughter and applause. Noah B. Kaplan, a Law School alumnus in attendance, said he thought the speech was “electrifying.”
“Having someone with that calibre and prominence at an event like this creates a lot of energy and gives people a sense of possibility,” he said.
The conference also featured panels, workshops, and a networking session where alumni recruiters from 15 public service organizations connected with interested students. It is organized by several career advising and public interest groups on campus including the Center for Public Interest Careers and the Harvard Alumni Association, and coordinated by the College's assistant dean for public service, Gene A. Corbin.
Maribel Hernández Rivera ’04, a recruiter from Immigrant Justice Corps, said the conference felt like a “validation” of the public sector.
“It’s great to see the energy from people who are willing to spend a Saturday here to tell you this is great to do,” she said.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will receive the Radcliffe Medal this upcoming May in recognition of her advocacy for equality and justice.
The Radcliffe Medal is presented annually to an individual who has made significant and effective contributions to change and progress. Lizabeth Cohen, dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, wrote in an emailed statement that medal honorees exemplify the core values of the Institute and its predecessor, Radcliffe College.
“The quality of risk-taking and forging ahead is a hallmark of Radcliffe – from the women who attended the College to the innovative scholars, scientists, and artists at the Institute today,” Cohen wrote. “They are connected by a spirit of inquiry and a commitment to excellence.”
Ginsburg, who attended Harvard Law School, will be presented with the award on Radcliffe Day on May 29.
“Radcliffe Day is an annual celebration of Radcliffe’s past, present, and future,” Cohen wrote. “It is figuratively and literally a big tent occasion that encompasses the Radcliffe Institute...​ and the legacy of its predecessor, Radcliffe College.”
The occasion, in celebration and remembrance of Radcliffe’s history, will feature a conversation between Ginsburg, retired Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61, and Kathleen M. Sullivan, a former Harvard Law School professor and former dean of Stanford Law School.
In addition to the medal ceremony itself, Radcliffe Day also includes a panel discussion in the morning connected to the medalist’s work. This year’s panel, “A Decade of Decisions and Dissents: The Roberts Court, from 2005 to Today," includes four panelists and will be moderated by Margaret H. Marshall, the former chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and a past Radcliffe Day medalist.
Other past medalists include athlete Billie Jean King, the late author and poet Maya Angelou, feminist activist Gloria Steinem, and oceanographer Sylvia Earle. Last year’s awardee was University President Drew G. Faust, who was the founding dean of the Radcliffe Institute.

UPDATED: January 25, 2015, at 10:18 p.m.
The working group that crafted Harvard’s newly centralized sexual harassment policy and accompanying procedures did not anticipate that individual schools would deviate from those procedures to the extent Harvard Law School may, according to University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides.
Karvonides led the group that created Harvard’s new approach for approaching sexaul assault complaints, which in July established a standardized set of procedures under which a centralized office would investigate complaints of alleged sexual harassment against students across the entire University. That office, the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, makes a determination of guilt while individual schools handle discipline.
But in December, Harvard Law School moved to depart from those central procedures, approving a set of their own that would allow the school to investigate their own sexual harassment complaints, cutting ODR out of the process entirely. Those policies are pending approval from the U.S. Department of Education as part of an agreement with the government after it found the Law School in violation of Title IX in late December.
Despite the Law School’s actions, Karvonides, speaking in her first interview with The Crimson since the Law School Title IX finding, said she does not expect other schools at Harvard to follow suit.
“I don’t think that the working group really contemplated that one school would go across, go a different way," Karvonides said, adding that she thinks the Law School’s approach to handling sexual assault complaints historically differs most from other schools.
According to Karvonides, in the fall semester alone, ODR initiated between 6 and 12 cases, more investigations into cases of alleged sexual harassment against students than the total figure across the University during the 2013-2014 academic year.
Karvonides would not specify whether ODR, which she said is still looking to fill two full-time investigator positions, has completed any investigations.
The Law School’s adoption of its pending procedures went through several levels of discussion before approval. University President Drew G. Faust and University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 granted Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow permission to set up a faculty committee for developing school-specific procedures after the new central policy was unveiled, according to University spokesperson Jeff Neal. That decision came after “broad consultation that included discussions with the Council of Deans, among many others,” Neal wrote in an emailed statement.
Karvonides said she offered background information about Title IX and her experience handling cases to John C. Coates, a Law School professor who headed the faculty committee that wrote the school’s pending procedures. The ultimate decision to allow a school to develop its own specific procedures is beyond her authority, she said.
Major differences between the University-wide procedures and the Law School-specific ones include the Law School’s pending incorporation of hearings into the adjudication process and a potentially larger role for attorneys.
Karvonides said that the working group that designed the University-wide policy and procedures intentionally focused on creating a model where investigators could hear directly from complainants and respondents. Under the central procedures, personal advisers cannot speak on behalf of their advisees during interviews with investigators. The pending Law School procedures, however, allow a student’s adviser or attorney to “participate in the conversation” with investigators.
The Law School’s departure from central Title IX procedures follows sharp faculty criticism of those central procedures. In October, a group of Law School professors submitted a letter to The Boston Globe arguing that the University’s central sexual assault policy and procedures were ill-conceived, “overwhelmingly stacked against the accused,” and undermine the authority of individual schools across the University.
Karvonides, however, maintains that ODR staff are properly handling all investigations and that schools have been pleased by its work.
“I think [schools] appreciate the level of thoroughness, the level of expertise that is being brought to bear, the level of communication and coordination so there are no surprises for folks, the sensitivity, and the parity that we are providing to the parties,” Karvonides said.
A separate federal investigation into the College’s Title IX compliance is still underway.
Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga was present during The Crimson’s interview with Karvonides.

Country music power couple Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood fielded questions from students at the newly-revamped “Conversations with Harvard” speaker series about their careers and personal lives Friday at the Graduate School of Education.
This first-ever Conversations with Harvard evolved from Conversations with Kirkland, a speaker series launched by former Kirkland resident scholar Peter V. Emerson in 2002. According to Emerson, Conversations with Kirkland aimed to foster “an informal environment for actual conversation” with distinguished leaders in the arts, music, politics, media, and business. While Conversations with Kirkland gave priority to Kirkland House residents, Emerson said the name change made it clear that all Harvard affiliates could attend the event.
“We decided it wasn’t fair to have it at one House, that everybody should have a chance to participate,” Emerson said.
Emerson first met Brooks six years ago in January 2009 while backstage at President Barack Obama’s first inauguration celebration concert, at which Brooks performed as a headlining act and agreed to speak at the University upon hearing Emerson’s pitch. The Harvard event finally came together when Brooks aligned the schedule with his tour stop in Boston.
To a packed lecture hall, Brooks and Yearwood reflected on their journeys to becoming acclaimed artists, the two having had very different approaches to the music industry.
According to Brooks, he was informed after his college graduation ceremony that he was one hour short from actually receiving a degree, and despite financial pressures, he went back to school to take a summer course. Brooks said that in order to finance what remained of his education, he began to play guitar at Willies Saloon, a local bar.
“One night turned into three nights; three nights turned into five to six nights a week,” Brooks said.
For her part, Yearwood said she knew since she was a child that she wanted to be a singer.
“I knew what I wanted to do. I just had no clue about how to go about it, ” Yearwood said.
Both Brooks and Yearwood said that making the decision to go forward with their dreams required courage.
“There is a huge difference between you and the people you left in your hometown,” Brooks said. “And that difference was that you had the courage to leave.”
When attendee Leah E. Waldo, a student in the Ed School’s Arts in Education program, said she worried about how her music was received and asked the couple about how they gained confidence in their performances, the couple asked Waldo to come onstage and sing in front of the audience. After the event, Brooks gifted Waldo his guitar.
The event also featured a video of Brooks's acclaimed 1992 song, “We Shall Be Free,” which received some backlash at the time of its release from more conservative groups about a lyric, “When we’re free to love anyone we choose," that was perceived to express support for same-sex relationships.
However, Yearwood said the song was “the anthem of the world” and “ahead of its time.”
“Love is something that the law can’t constitute,” Brooks said.

While crowded lecture halls, visiting multiple classes within an hour, and narrowing down a course schedule typically characterize shopping week, the first official week of the semester will face an additional challenge as a blizzard looms over the horizon for huge swaths of the Northeast.
The National Weather Service predicts a “crippling and potentially historic” 20 to 30 inches of snow for the Boston area, with snowfall accumulation at rates from 2 to 4  inches per hour. A blizzard warning will be in effect from 7 p.m. Monday to 1 a.m. Wednesday, and the weather center deemed travel “impossible and life threatening” during this time.
The University’s emergency management team has been monitoring the storm since Saturday, and it is expected that the University will notify affiliates about its plans Monday afternoon, according to University spokesperson Jeff Neal.
Historically, only very substantial weather events have forced the University to curtail any operations. In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III joked that, “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.”
The University canceled classes due to snow in 1978 when a blizzard blanketed Boston with 27 inches of snow. More recently, winter storm Nemo in 2013 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 prompted the University to close several University buildings and cancel work for non-essential University employees.
In a statement, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said, “Our City has been through blizzards before, and I am confident we are prepared.”

Freshmen kicked off the new semester in Sanders Theatre Sunday night at "ReFRESHMENt," a new event encouraging the Class of 2018 to reflect on their fall semester and to be motivated for the spring term.
The presentation, which was was organized by the First-Year Social Committee, the Undergraduate Council, and the Freshman Dean’s Office, included entertainment featuring students and faculty speakers. According to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, it will become a new annual tradition.
“[We want] to heighten their sense of belonging and their sense of being a part of the Class of 2018,” Dingman said. “We want them to think about their purpose for being in college and what they’re going to do to make this transformative journey really productive.”
Dingman said “students love ritual” and that this seemed like a fitting new tradition with which to begin the second semester.
In addition to Dingman, speakers at the event included Dean of College Rakesh Khurana, biology professor of practice Robert A. Lue, and Michael C. Ranen, the dean for freshmen in Ivy Yard.
“Your life doesn’t change once; it changes again and again and again,” Lue said, encouraging students to continue into the spring semester with a “rising tide of passion.”
Khurana reminded students to craft their own experience at Harvard during the next seven semesters.
“There is no one best way to do Harvard,” Khurana said. “The students who do the best and get the most out of college are the ones who make authentic choices to themselves. They don’t let someone else write their Harvard story for them.”
The event also featured several freshmen, who provided entertainment ranging from poetry to magic tricks. Aisha Bhoori '18, who presented a spoken word poem with Simone E. A. Abegunrin '18, said she hoped the poem addressed the shared experience from the fall semester and goals for the spring semester.
“[We wanted to discuss] that it’s less about the arbitrary ‘A,’ and more about trying to find yourself and expanding yourself,” Bhoori said, “and taking all these strands and piecing together an identity.”
The event was followed by a reception in Annenberg Hall.
Khurana left the class with a final remark about pursuing the diverse people and opportunities available to them during their time here.
“If we as a community are different from what exists in the world, an alternative future opens up,” he said. “We have all of the ingredients here.”

After a weekend of competing at home, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field program sent a limited squad southwest to New Mexico to compete against West Coast and Texas programs in the Lobo Collegiate Invitational.
The Crimson athletes showed they could compete with talent located outside the boundaries of the Northeast, as seniors Danielle Barbian and Ben Glauser, along with sophomore Nikki Okwelogu won their respective events.
Barbian proved to be the star of the show for Harvard, as the Sussex, Wis. native took home the title in the 60 meter dash with a time of 7.44 seconds. The senior would follow it up with a personal best 24.46 in the 200 meter dash.
The 60 meter performance matched the senior’s school and Ivy League record and edged out second place Leshel Vines of CSU Northridge by .08 seconds.
Though Barbian was the only individual to claim a title on the track, her fellow runners would follow with solid performances throughout the meet.
“It was a great win for Danielle in the 60, equaling her best from the Ivy League championships last year,” head coach Jason Saretsky said. “To come back in the 200 really speaks to how she’s evolved and progressed.”
Gabrielle Scott placed third in the 600 meter run, while junior Autumne Franklin took sixth in the 60 meter hurdle finals with a time of 8.66. In the 4x400 meter relay, the team of Scott, Madison Hansen, Jade Miller and Christi Scott got the runner-up slot in the podium with a 3:44.77.
Not to be outdone by their track counterparts, the field athletes, led by Glauser and Okwelogu, took home a pair of titles while also continuing individual winning streaks.
Okwelogu continued her torrid start to the season, as the sophomore took home her third straight shot put title, posting a mark of 15.68 meters, .67 meters further than the second place finisher.
The throw was also the third time this season that the Fresno, Calif. native threw further than 15.31 meters, the mark Okwleogu notched to claim the Ivy League Indoor Heps title last year.
Okwelogu wasn’t the only thrower to have a string of victories, as Glauser took home his second consecutive title in the weight throw. The men’s captain had a 19.39 meter toss to take home the title and added a fifth place finish in the shot put with a 16.57 meter mark.
Despite the early success of the team, Glauser believes that there is still much work to do in order for the throwers to earn another Ivy League title.
“I think it’s looking good for us,” Glauser said. “But there is still a lot of season left and a lot of things can happen. It’s a really good conference and it will present stiff competition.”
Glauser was joined on the weight throw podium by sophomore Josh Whitener, who placed third in the weight throw by 18.29 meters.
The meet gives the athletes an experience to compete against some of the best talent in the nation while exposing the Crimson to competition outside the Ancient Eight.
“The biggest thing is getting out of our comfort zone a little bit.” Saretsky said. “You start to see a lot of familiar faces here in the Northeast and you get a little bit comfortable with the competition.”
The team returns to action next week at the Terrier Invite, hosted at Boston University, before returning home to host the Harvard, Yale, Princeton meet on February 14th.
The H-Y-P event is one of the most important meets of the year for Harvard, as the team competes against Ivy rivals Tigers and Bulldogs for bragging rights between the three schools. The men look to beat Princeton at the meet for the first time since 1986.
“H-Y-P will be fun,” Glauser said. “The men have never beat Princeton at H-Y-P or Heps since I’ve been here but this year is a really good opportunity to come out on top.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team beat Ancient Eight rival Cornell with 2,028 fans on hand at its annual White the Bright event, breaking the team’s single game attendance record.
Firing 41 shots on net for the second consecutive game, the No. 5/5 Crimson (14-3-2, 11-2-1 ECAC) beat the No. 9/10 Big Red (10-7-3, 8-3-2), 3-0, in a game full of last-minute goals.
The win came less than 24 hours after the team's victory against Colgate. But that win had already escaped the minds of the Harvard skaters, who were all focused on long-time rival Cornell.
“The atmosphere was awesome,” junior forward Miye D’Oench said.“On the whole, the game was its own horse really. It was really fun to play in, and it was really, really fun to win.”
While Harvard’s first two goals came in the game’s opening period, the contest’s defining moment came 57 seconds before the final whistle blew, when junior forward Mary Parker scored an empty net goal. Parker received a pass from senior defenseman Marissa Gedman and wasted no time putting the puck in the back of the net to notch her second goal of the night.
“Our goal was to play the full 60 minutes and play our best for the entirety of the game,” D’Oench said. “Cornell has a really short bench, so we really wore them down with relentless forechecking and backchecking. By the end of the game, they really didn’t have that much left in the tank, so we were able to bury them.”
Parker’s other goal bookended the match, coming only three minutes into the first period. The assist came from senior defenseman Sarah Edney, her second of the weekend and eighth of the season.
The set of goals scored by Parker marked her seventh and eighth goals this season, bringing her point total to 20. She led the Crimson in shots on goal with eight.
Harvard had a flare for the dramatics on its second goal as well, scoring with 42 seconds left in the first period. Co-captain junior defenseman Michelle Picard drove the puck into the top left corner. She was assisted by fellow captain Samantha Reber and senior defenseman Josephine Pucci.
For Picard, who had notched an assist the night before, her second goal of the season came on a power play after the Big Red was penalized for having too many players on the ice. The Crimson went 1-for-2 on the man advantage, while Cornell failed to capitalize on its opportunities, going 0-for-3.
“We take a lot of pride in both our power play and our penalty kill,” Pucci said.“The power play really is an opportunity to pick it up a notch, [and] get the momentum and energy on our side.”
Both teams went scoreless in the second period, despite the 41 shots taken—26 and 15 from Harvard and Cornell respectively. The Crimson's second period shot total exceeded that of Cornell for the entire game, as Harvard went on to outshoot the Big Red, 41-22. The Crimson won the faceoff battle as well, winning 35 compared to Cornell’s 30.
Junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer anchored the Harvard defense from the crease, earning her second shutout of the season and Harvard's second of the weekend.
D’Oench credits the Crimson's success on both the offensive and defensive ends to the team’s ability to work together.
“The [forechecking and backchecking] gave our bench a lot of energy,” D’Oench said. “And [Maschmeyer] was really solid in net, so that gave us a lot of confidence too. The whole unit was working together, feeding off each other’s momentum.”
With two wins on the weekend, Harvard now trails No. 3/4 Quinnipiac in the ECAC standings by only a point. The Crimson will have a chance to take first place Friday on the road against the Bobcats, but for now, the team is remaining focused on internal improvement.
“We’re just trying to get better as a team every day and every practice,” Pucci said.“We’re just trying to progress and get better both individually and collectively. And hopefully we’ll be able to build on things that we take away from each game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 26, 2015, at 1:00 a.m.
Harvard versus Dartmouth. A 14-point deficit. A late, furious, and successful comeback.
Four hours after the Big Green men’s basketball squad lived out this narrative en route to a come-from-behind victory in Cambridge, Mass., the Crimson women’s squad achieved the same feat, clawing back for a 75-69 win over Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H. Propelled by a 12-0 run in the last three minutes, the Crimson erased a double-digit halftime gap.
“We simply never gave up,” said senior forward Temi Fagbenle. “We resolved to leave it all out on the court and attack the way we know how to. It was truly a team effort.”
After 39 minutes of basketball, Harvard had yet to hold a lead. But with two shots—one missed and one made—junior guard Shilpa Tummala changed that.
At the 1:04 mark, a missed free throw from Tummala led to an offensive rebound by senior forward Erin McDonnell, a second-chance possession, and an open three for Tummala. This time she didn’t miss, giving the Crimson a 68-67 advantage and its first lead of the game.
From there, it was a matter of fundamentals—defense and free throw shooting. On one end, the Crimson prevented Dartmouth from getting a go-ahead bucket, only conceding a layup with 20 seconds left when the visitors held a 5-point lead. On the other end, Harvard went 7-of-8 from the charity stripe in the final minute to ensure the victory.
“[Free throw shooting] is definitely something we practice regularly,” said senior guard Ali Curtis. “This week in practice especially we ended almost every practice with a pressure free throw drill. It payed off big for us in this game.”
This last-minute performance bore little resemblance to the Crimson’s first-half play, when the team went down 8-0 early and entered the break down by 13. In the period, Harvard racked up 10 turnovers compared to eight assists.
“[That was] due to a repeating fault of beating ourselves or shooting ourselves in the foot,” junior forward AnnMarie Healy said. “In the first three minutes, they were able to capitalize on our turnovers and fouls.”
Even so, the Crimson got early production from Healy, who scored nine points in the first frame and finished with 17 on 8-of-13 shooting. Healy has now reached double figures in nine of her last 11 games, including an average of 19 over the past three contests.
However, in the last three minutes, it was fellow forward Fagbenle and Tummala who erased the deficit in the 12-0 spurt. Fagbenle scored four points during the stretch, and Tummala contributed her big trey.
“I love playing with Temi,” Healy said. “As teammates, we both have a lot of confidence in each other…. We definitely have a look when we both know that we have to turn it on.”
Fagbenle finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds, her seventh double-double of the season. Combined, she and Healy are averaging nearly 28 points and 17 rebounds a game.
“Our relationship on the court is fierce,” Fagbenle said. “We are pretty in tune with what the other is going to do, and we give each other so much energy.”
After facing a 13-point disadvantage at halftime, the Crimson cut into the lead right away with a McDonnell three-pointer on the first possession. However, Harvard would get no closer than seven over the next 16 minutes as the Big Green negated any comeback efforts with buckets of its own.
Sophomore guard Fanni Szabo led the Dartmouth attack, registering a game-high 25 points in 39 minutes of play. She gave her squad its largest lead of the game with 6:21 left by knocking down a jumper to push the score to 62-48.
From that point on, the Crimson outscored the hosts, 27-7.
“I think we have stepped up intensity-wise,” Curtis said. “It’s always expected in the Ivy League, but there’s an extra sense of pride with us this year because of how our season has gone so far. We either step it up or roll over, and we are choosing to bring it.”

An earlier version of this article misquoted senior forward Temi Fagbenle. Fagbenle referred to the way her team knows "how to," not "hot to," play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard wrestling team, injuries proved to be too much of an obstacle in its match against Bucknell at the Malkin Athletic Center Sunday, as the Bison, who are undefeated in the EIWA, stampeded past Harvard, 26-9. With the loss, the Crimson moves to 1-4, with an 0-3 EIWA record.
“There’s a lot of things that we could have done better,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Bucknell has a strong team that wrestles well on top, and you could see today that there are some things that we need to get better at on the bottom. Overall we just need to fight more. Our guys need to understand that it’s not just about technique. We need to really fight.”
At this point in the season, the Crimson has several athletes out with injuries, including all of its athletes in the 125-pound weight class.
“We knew that we were going to have to forfeit at 125, so we went into the match already six points down,” co-captain James Fox said. “It was a tough start that we just couldn’t overcome.
Following this rocky beginning, stand out performances for Harvard came from Fox and junior co-captain Todd Preston, as well as rookie Josef Johnson, each of whom notched a win for the Crimson. Preston managed to pull out a win against Bucknell’s Tyler Smith, edging past his opponent with a 4-3 win.
“Todd wrestled a close, controlled match,” Weiss said. “Was he wrestling his best? No. But you need to be able to pull off the win even when you’re not at your best, and that’s what he did today.”
For Fox, his individual win marked a big turnaround from last weekend’s performance against Cornell, as the senior took a commanding 6-1 victory over Tyler Greene of the Bison.
“I had a week to rehab and recover from a knee injury that’s been really tough, and feeling healthy helped me to perform better today,” Fox said. “And mentally, I was just more confident in the moves. I was a bit sluggish last weekend, so I changed up my warm-up, and stayed a lot more mentally focused.”
Harvard’s third winner of the day was Johnson, who notched his fourth collegiate win with his performance over Bucknell’s Rory Bonner. The freshman held on in a gritty match, garnering the win in a 4-3 decision.
“Josef Johnson, he’s becoming better and better at wrestling those close matches and pulling out wins with every contest,” Weiss said.
Freshman Kanon Dean and senior heavyweight David Ng missed out on recording victories for the Crimson, but each put up a notable fight.
“Kanon did well, he fought hard and did a nice job for us out there,” Weiss said. “At heavyweight, I think David is better than that, and he definitely could have wrestled with that guy.”
After the match, Weiss acknowledged that the Crimson’s fate is ultimately going to be tied heavily to the injuries that are plaguing the squad right now.
“We have some growing pains right now, but it’s okay as long as our guys take steps from it and learn from it and keep working hard,” Weiss said. “We need to keep making adjustments. Obviously we are disappointed, but we have the time to heal up this next week and a half and get some guys back, which is going to help a lot.”

Another race, another top-10 finish for the Harvard skiing team, which placed ninth out of 16 teams with 284 points.
“I think the team really did well this weekend. Everyone set pre-race goals and most people achieved them,” sophomore Nordic skier Rachel Hampton said. “I think everyone was aggressive in the races and even if it didn't quite have the end result they wanted, everyone could feel good about attacking the races.”
The group finished 656 points behind the winner of the Carnival at Stowe Mt. Resort and Trapp Family Lodge—Vermont.
“We all came into this weekend really focused and excited to take the lessons from the first weekend of racing and apply them to this weekend to feel good and produce strong results,” said captain and Nordic skier Akeo Maifeld-Carucci.
Maifeld-Carucci led the team with two top-10 finishes. His best race was the 10K freestyle, where he finished with a time of 25:46.2, which gave him the fourth place finish out of 92 skiers.
It was a fight to the end of the race for Maifeld-Carucci, who was just edged out by the No. 3 skier, Université Laval’s Frederic Touchette, who finished only .2 seconds ahead of the Crimson competitor.
“I felt like I had solid performances this weekend,” Maifeld-Carucci said. “I felt a little more tired than last weekend but thought I skied well technically. Especially Friday's race had really tight times, so it was really important to try and push for every second as that correlated to several places for some people.”
In his second race of the Carnival, the 15K event, Maifeld-Carucci crossed the finish line at 42:29.8. At number eight of 82 racers, he finished one spot off from his bib slot, nearly ten seconds off from the seventh place finisher, Will Wicherski from Williams College, and just two seconds ahead of the ninth place finisher, Patrick McElravey from Middlebury.
Freshman Nordic skier Connor Green and sophomore Nordic skier Devlin Shea finished the 10K in spots better than their bib slots, taking the 46th and 47th spots, respectively.
Green finished with a time of 27:42.3. Shea was right on his heels, finishing 1.2 seconds after his teammate.
Green also finished No. 44 in the 15K race—12 spots better than his bib slot—with a time of 45:37.8.
For the women, Hampton nearly broke into the top-10 in the 10K race, finishing it at 33:38.8. This gave her an 11th place finish out of 99. It was another close race for the Crimson team, with Hampton finishing just one second behind UVM’s Stephanie Kirk.
In the 5K race, Hamptons ranked in the top-15 again, just nabbing the 15th spot of 103 competitors with a 15:10.0 time. Her race was close went down to the last few seconds, with her following the 12th place finisher, Emily Hannah from Dartmouth, by just .7 seconds.
“I think it was a really good weekend for me,” Hampton said. “I'm just consistent [in] moving my way up in the pack and a personal best finish of 11th was really encouraging. I think I stuck to my race strategy and also raced with a lot of guts and no fear.”
Junior Nordic skier Hannah Barnes was in the top-50, placing 44th with a time of 36:32.2.
Alpine skier freshman Kelly Steeves finished the giant slalom course in 2:18.59, earning her 23rd place; and finished the regular slalom course in 2:13.63, giving her 27th place. Junior Jack Stobierski placed 30th in the slalom course, finishing in 2:10.98.
“This weekend was the end of the first third of the race season, and we have been training fairly hard steadily for almost the past month, so we are taking this next week to rest and recover a little before we dive into the rest of the season,” Maifeld-Carucci said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matched up against two ranked opponents over the weekend, the No. 50 Harvard women's tennis team (2-1) came away with a split at the ITA Kick-Off Weekend in Nashville, TN. One day after falling to No. 12 Vanderbilt (2-0) by a score of 4-0, the Crimson rebounded with 4-2 victory over No. 45 DePaul (0-2).
HARVARD 4, DEPAUL 2
The Crimson was quick to rebound on Sunday, picking up a 4-2 win to avoid falling below .500 for the first time since the 2011-2012 season. After winning the doubles point, Harvard took three of the five completed singles matches to come away with its second win of the year.
In the closest match of the day, sophomore June Lee earned a victory on court one, defeating Blue Demons' freshman Patricia Lacranjan in three sets, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 7-5.
For Lee, the win came on the heels of another victory over Lacranjan in doubles play. The sophomore pairing of Lee and Monica Lin defeated Lacranjan and senior Jasmin King, 7-6 (5), in a tiebreak to clinch the first point of the day for the Crimson.
Freshmen Nikki Kallenberg and Annika Ringblom won the day's first match over DePaul's pairing of juniors Jarret Fisher and Zaina Sufi, 6-3. Meanwhile, senior Sylvia Li and rookie Ellen Jang-Milsten fell to sophomore Yuliya Shupenia and senior Rebeca Mitrea of the Blue Demons, 4-6.
The success of Kallenberg and Ringblom carried over into singles play, as each rookie picked up a win in three sets. On court two, Kallenberg defeated DePaul junior Ana Vladutu, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, while Ringblom earned a win over Kling on court four, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
Harvard lost its first two singles matches, with Lin and Jang-Milsten each coming up short in straight sets. But the Crimson responded with three consecutive singles wins, capped by Lee's three-set nail-biter, to come from behind and earn the win.
VANDERBILT 4, HARVARD 0
On Saturday, the Crimson had a difficult time handling the hosts of the event. Despite putting up a strong effort in doubles play, Harvard dropped three consecutive singles matches in straight sets, falling to the Commodores, 4-0.
Together, Lee and Lin fell to Vanderbilt's top pairing of sophomore Sydney Campbell and junior Courtney Colton, 3-6. Kallenberg and Ringblom were one game away from picking up a victory, but their match came to a halt after Li and Jang-Milsten dropped a close match to Commodore seniors Ashleigh Antal and Marie Casares, 5-6.
In singles play, Campbell won her second match of the day over Lee, 6-1, 6-1. Casares and Vanderbilt sophomore Astra Sharma also picked up wins over Ringblom and Jang-Milsten to round out the concluded matches.
Kallenberg had a chance to pick up a win on court two, as she led Colton, 6-5. But just like in doubles play, her match came to a premature end after the Commodores clinched the overall victory.

The Harvard men’s tennis team split its weekend matches on its West Coast swing, winning one of two against highly ranked squads as part of ITA Kick-Off Weekend.
The 30th-ranked Crimson (4-1) fell to No. 15 UC Berkeley on Friday, 4-2, before taking down No. 27 NC State, 4-3, at the Golden Bears’ Hellman Tennis Center in Berkeley, Calif.
The ITA Kick-Off Weekend, which features 60 of the nation’s strongest teams competing at various schools across the country, serves as an important barometer at the start of the spring season, and determines berths in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in February.
Harvard faced a tough test on Friday in UC Berkeley, which reached the sweet 16 of last season’s NCAA Championships, and the job became more difficult when the Crimson lost the doubles point.
The Golden Bears’ Filip Bergevi and Mads Engsted knocked off co-captain Alex Steinroeder and freshman Grant Solomon in third doubles, 6-4. Then, co-captain Denis Nguyen and sophomore Brian Yeung, already the seventh-ranked doubles tandem in the nation in their first season together, fell short against No. 42 Gregory Bayane and Chase Melton, 6-3.
Harvard quickly regained the lost point, as No. 86 sophomore Sebastian Beltrame won 6-3, 7-6(4). But junior Nicky Hu fell against No. 93 Bergevi in a tough 7-6(5), 7-5 match, and a three-set loss for Yeung meant the Crimson was in a hole, 3-1.
Steinroeder pushed back with a comeback victory, 5-7, 7-5, 6-3, but Nguyen’s three-set loss, 5-7, 6-2, 7-5, clinched the match for Cal.
Because of the loss, Harvard next faced the Wolfpack, which fell to Mississippi State, in the consolation match. But the competition remained fierce, especially since NC State featured strong players across singles and doubles.
Steinroeder and Solomon picked up a 6-4 win, and while Nguyen and Yeung dropped their second contest of the weekend, Beltrame and Hu were able to clinch the doubles point by sneaking by, 7-6(6).
In singles, Beltrame picked up his second win of the weekend, 6-4, 6-3, but the Wolfpack closed the gap by defeating Yeung. Freshman Kenny Tao stepped up with a 7-6(5), 6-4 victory, but Harvard dropped matches on both the first and second courts, and suddenly the match was deadlocked, 3-3.
It all came down to the fourth court, but Steinroeder completed his comeback over NC State’s Beck Bond to win, 3-6, 7-6(2), 7-5,  to hand Harvard the overall victory.
While Harvard’s third-place finish for the weekend was not ideal in terms of qualifying for the National Team Indoor Championships, it still served as a strong showing for a team looking to reclaim the Ivy League title this spring.
The Crimson will next play in two weekends, when it will travel to Northwestern.

For the third week in a row, the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s hockey team (12-4-2, 8-3-2 ECAC) remained steady in the USCHO and USA Today/USA Hockey national rankings. The polls were released after Harvard split its weekend slate with a one-goal loss in Ithaca and a five-goal throbbing of No. 15/- Colgate.
The fact that Harvard has dropped three of its last five contests did not go completely unnoticed by the committee. This week marks the first time since Nov. 24 that Harvard did not receive a first place vote in the USCHO rankings. The team reached its peak of first place votes with 15 on Jan. 5, but has lost all of those votes over the last three week span of play.
Even though the Crimson stayed even in the USCHO poll nominally, the squad did gain some ground. Its point margin over the fifth place team (UMass-Lowell last week, Nebraska-Omaha this week) increased from 58 to 75 points.
Harvard fluctuated in other polling systems, however. In the PairWise rankings, the Crimson jumped from seventh place to a tie for third with Boston University and Nebraska-Omaha. Its fate was not the same in the KRACH poll, where it fell from sixth to eighth place.
North Dakota took over the top spot after former No. 1 Minnesota State finished the weekend without a win. BU also leapfrogged the Mavericks to finish at No. 2/2 after two wins over No. 12/14 Vermont.

Welcome back! What happened around Harvard Square while you all fled to different cities, states, or countries? Well, for one, Massachusetts turned into a Siberian tundra for about a week and it was so cold that local schools closed, very realistically fearing that their students would literally turn into ice sculptures before the buses warmed up. And there’s finally snow on the ground for all the Californians to marvel at until they realize how annoying semi-frozen water is to walk around in all day. But in terms of newsworthy happenings...
If Boston gets the 2024 Olympic bid, some events will take place at Harvard: You probably heard that Boston got the U.S. Olympic bid and now has to duel other countries in a Hunger Games-type scenario for the right to host the Olympics (I think that’s how it works?). But did you know that Harvard would host events ranging from aquatics and tennis for the Olympics to football and wheelchair fencing in the Paralympics?
Harvard’s federal funding drops following sequestration: Oh crap! Federal funding fell 5 percent this year...who knows the effects this is going to have on research in important fields like STEM, medicine, and...oh nevermind, non-federal funding increased 12 percent so it’s probably fine.
Chris Pratt named Hasty Pudding’s Man of the Year: Andy Dwyer from Parks and Recreation joins his boss Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), who was named Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year for 2014 (and also Ridgley Hall Room 52 Woman of the Year). There will be a celebrity roast on Feb. 6. Unlike federal funding, people actually care about humor and celebrities, so this is huge news.
On a serious note, Michael J. Davidson, an assistant professor of surgery at the Medical School, passed away from a gunshot wound suffered on January 20th after a shooting at the Brigham and Women's Hospital. Flyby would like to express its condolences to his families and loved ones.
While the break may be over and even though there’s snow on the ground (and we’re apparently in for way more), happy spring...semester, everyone!

Happy first day of classes everyone! In addition to the stress of shopping for classes, adjusting to the HUDS diet, and getting used to unending sleep deprivation, a winter storm is also hitting us. Winter Storm Juno is apparently going to leave way over a foot of snow– quadlings, will we be seeing your faces this week? If we’re going to get that much snow, we might as well wish for a snow day (or two, or three....or a week)!
IN THE ATMOSPHEREThere’s going to be some brutal weather starting from today! It’ll be a high of 30 degrees and a chance of snow starting from this afternoon. But watch out for tonight– it’ll be a high of 20 degrees and a 100% chance of over one foot of snow! Time to pack on those layers!

What do the postal service and C’est Bon have in common? Neither rain nor snow can stop them from upholding their constitutional duty.

Harvard’s premier law-abiding liquor store will be open throughout the snowfall, extending their normal business hours for the foreseeable future. How do we know this? We were there ourselves just a few minutes ago.
Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 has declared a state of emergency, and so has C’est Bon. They are currently at code level Rubinoff.
However, C’est Bon not only treats its customers right, but its employees as well. After a long hard day of selling alcohol to College students, they will rest their weary legs at a local hotel and enjoy a fine glass of Andre. Please, support these heroes.
