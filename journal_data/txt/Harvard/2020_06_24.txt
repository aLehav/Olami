After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the 2016 election, pundits frequently predicted that Trump would usher in a new era of protest art. After decades of going relatively unnoticed, the argument went, his polarizing election would push sidelined protest art into the mainstream. The months and years that followed helped validate that argument in multiple ways: late-night comedians found new audiences through more political humor, stories of government oppression like “1984” came back in vogue, and shocking pieces of art denouncing Trump made headlines and stirred controversy. To some, it seemed like Trump redefined the zeitgeist overnight.
But the story is more complicated than just one election. Art in reaction to Trump is certainly everywhere; still, sometimes it takes flashpoint cultural moments to bring that existing work to the forefront of our minds.
Enter Algiers. The Atlanta band fronted by Franklin James Fisher released its third studio album, “There Is No Year,” on Jan. 17, but the album failed to chart in every country but Germany. While the band had by then eclipsed one million plays on Spotify with some cuts from their self-titled debut and 2017’s “The Underside of Power,” none of this album’s tracks have received the same attention. Mixed reviews from Pitchfork and The Needle Drop suggested the album failed to leave a lasting impression on listeners. This critique seemed accurate before the events following the horrific murder of George Floyd at the hand of Minneapolis police officers.
Algiers bring a sound to “There Is No Year” that is less consistently hard but more varied than “The Underside of Power.” “Wait For The Sound” illustrates this dichotomy well. Similar to their debut's remarkable “Blood,” the track's beat consistently builds throughout the run time, refusing to relent. "Blood" focuses on the constricting, generational impact of slavery and oppression. As such, the song never lets Fisher escape its beat. His emotional final verse still falls in line with the backing track, which then continues for a full minute after that last verse has stopped. But where "Blood" never fully boils over, "Wait For The Sound" eventually repositions itself behind Fisher's cathartic vocals, creating an emotional outro that ends as soon as Fisher's cries stop. Other songs — such as "Hour of the Furnaces" — take inspiration from "The Underside of Power" closer "The Cycle / The Spiral: Time to Go Down Slowly" by experimenting with layered vocals and larger soundscapes. As a whole, the album feels much funkier than their past efforts, and songs like "Chaka" display a band that's both confident and introspective.
As indicated by the album art — which depicts the letters of Algiers tumbling over a picture of a falling man — “There Is No Year” deals with a world in freefall. Fisher’s lyricism shines here, by bringing an unparalleled sense of urgency to his message. Indeed, Fisher's lyrics seem downright prophetic when listened to now, especially for listeners whose concern for racial injustice has arisen only recently. The very first words of the album — “Now it’s two minutes to midnight," off the titular track — warn of an imminent revolution. Fisher writes of a salient contrast between demonstrators and bystanders. The “Streets are raining fire” in “Wait For The Sound,” but on the other side, “Hour Of The Furnaces” depicts “Outright denial / Of the dying and the sane.” Fisher further explores this opposition to the movement in songs like “Losing Is Ours,” with lines like “Let the sirens sing out their nightmare” because “They’ll be too in denial to know." The ultimate dagger to the resistance is indifference. The final words of the album, from “Nothing Bloomed,” detail how “Everything starts to fade under the weight of silence.” It is hard to listen to these words and not be reminded of today's activists, whose main enemy is arguably the silence surrounding them.
It is too simplistic to say “There Is No Year” has a singular thesis — and it shouldn’t have to — but the standout track “Dispossession” is the album’s closest thing to a mission statement. Sonically, the song’s production is refined but invigorating, and the chorus’s backing vocals make the tune undeniably catchy. The track’s brilliance, though, lies in its message. Fisher acts as a harbinger of the coming revolution, telling the listener to “Run around, run away from your America / While it burns in the streets / I been here standing on top of the mountain / Shouting down what I see.” The larger message is not one of hope but rather the necessity of fighting back: “Everybody wants to break down,” he sings, but “You can’t run away” from the struggle. While the band explored similar themes over the course of "The Underside of Power," “Dispossession” hits on all of these themes at once. The song blends elements of unity: “We are the blade and the groove that come together”; and force: “We are the rain of fire that’s coming down.” “Dispossession” coalesces into a cohesive narrative of resistance, one that is so accurate that it has been used to caption photos of protestors.
Overall, “There Is No Year” could not sound more relevant at this point in time. Critics myopically dismissed the album as “frustratingly opaque,” as if they would have preferred a narrower, easier-to-digest rebuke of the Trump administration. Algiers leaves those rebukes for other artists for an important reason: The last few weeks have made disturbingly clear that societal problems, while greatly exacerbated by Trump, extend far beyond his reach. Fisher’s cries for action can only be read within a broader history of Black activism and suffering. Protest art reflects both new problems and old, particularly now, as tentacles of hate that reach back into this country’s roots threaten to suffocate it.
While “There Is No Year” is not an album for optimists, Fisher hopes out loud in “Dispossession” that “Freedom is coming soon.” When is soon? Nobody knows. Until then, however, “There Is No Year” deserves to be recognized as one of the most important albums of recent memory, the protest art the country needs to hear — not just in the wake of George Floyd’s death, but throughout the ongoing struggle for racial justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation Board announced a new proposal for the design of the Allston Multimodal Project on Monday which would not alter the Massachusetts Turnpike and Soldiers Field Road.
The new plan, known as the “Highway Viaduct alternative,” would make the modified highway viaduct shorter and narrower than the one that currently exists. It would also enable commuter rails to run underneath the viaduct with a ground-level Soldiers Field Road sitting adjacent to pedestrian and bicycle paths.
This is the latest proposal for the Allston Multimodal Project — a plan that began in 2014 to replace the existing Allston viaduct, improve the Mass. Turnpike and its interchange, and create a new commuter line stop known as West Station.
At Monday’s board meeting, Mass. Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack presented this new option to be considered alongside two other “build alternatives” — the “Soldiers Field Hybrid” alternative and the “At Grade” alternative — and a “no build” option which would entail extensive rehabilitation of the existing viaduct structure.
According to a presentation from the board meeting, among the advantages of this new alternative are “less complicated construction staging” and no impact on the Charles River. The other build alternatives would, in contrast, pose a need to construct in the Charles River.
The Soldiers Field Hybrid alternative would elevate Soldiers Field Road at “the throat” — the area where the 12 lanes converge at the narrowest point — and putting the Mass. Turnpike at grade. The At Grade alternative would put all structures level with surrounding land.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, who serves as president of the Allston Civic Association and a member of the task force on the Allston Multimodal Project, said the hybrid approach has become somewhat controversial after initially drawing support.
“We were happy about that because the modified hybrid approach that [Pollack] decided to embrace was to put the Mass. Pike at grade,” D’Isidoro said. “When it came out that in order to achieve the modified hybrid, MassDOT — out of the blue — announced that they would probably have to build a temporary Soldiers Field Road into the [Charles] River.”
Following Monday’s board and task force meetings, D’Isidoro wrote in an emailed statement that MassDOT has “rejected” any adjustments — such as reducing lanes or eliminating shoulders — that could be made to implement either the At Grade alternative or the Soldiers Field Hybrid alternative without expanding into the river.
“The no build alternative of refurbishing the existing viaduct is unacceptable to me,” D’Isidoro wrote. “Clearly, they are pointing us to the new modified highway viaduct alternative,” he added.
MassDOT could not be reached for comment.
D’Isidoro said the goals of the Allston Multimodal Project, since its inception, have gone beyond simply replacing the viaduct.
Richard A. Dimino, president and CEO of local business association A Better City, similarly said the project should go beyond just the viaduct problem.
“We've been specifically focused on trying to make sure that that project really realizes its full potential, not only being a multimodal project, but also a project that really enhances the land use and kind of urban characteristics of that space,” he said.
After the meeting, D’Isidoro wrote that he would “reserve judgment” in anticipation of possible “fine-tuning” that can be done to the two “at grade” alternatives to make them more widely acceptable.
The board presentation noted that when selecting among the three build alternatives, the relevant stakeholders will consider construction logistics, environmental impacts, cost, schedule, and traffic and rail operations.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has reached more than 188 countries and territories. As of June 21, 2020, more than 2.32 million cases and 122,000 deaths have been reported in the United States, with more than 111,000 cases and almost 2,000 deaths in the state of Texas.
On March 24, 2020, Austin issued its first of a series of “Stay Home, Work Safe” orders, including social distancing and face-covering requirements. On March 30, Texas Governor Greg W. Abbott issued a de facto state-wide stay-at-home order, instructing residents to minimize social gatherings, practice social distancing, and limit non-essential activities. On May 1, Texas became one of the first states to relax its statewide coronavirus restrictions, allowing some businesses, including restaurants and retail stores, to reopen to 25 percent capacity. Photojournalist Jenny M. Lu visited several spots in Austin in the week leading up to Texas’ reopening.
The Texas State Capitol, the seat of government of Texas, is located in the heart of downtown Austin. In response to COVID-19, the Capitol was closed to the public on March 18. Typically populated by visitors, elected officials, and other staff, the Capitol remained empty in late April. Although Abbott announced that museums could open as part of the state reopening that started May 1, the Capitol will stay closed to visitors.
The Paramount Theatre, a historic live and movie theatre venue, placed all performances on hold through June as an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. An uplifting message, written across its marquee, encouraged the Austin community to help each other through challenging times and situations.
In Austin’s warmer months like April, there are typically many kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, bat watching tours, and personal boats on Lady Bird Lake, yet few were seen due to social distancing guidelines and coronavirus restrictions.
Owners of businesses on Sixth Street, a historic street famous for its nightlife and entertainment, closed their bars and shops in response to the state restrictions to fight the pandemic. A local nonprofit named HOPE (Helping Other People Everywhere) launched HOPE for Health, a campaign to support local artists and businesses impacted by COVID-19. “Monster Homies” by Trish Monsters, one of several art installations commissioned by HOPE, adds a splash of color to the boarded-up doors of a bar on Sixth Street.
On a Wednesday evening in late April, except for two roamers on Onewheels, the streets were barren in The Domain, a popular north Austin office, retail, and residential center, usually crowded with people in the evening.
The Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail that goes around Lady Bird Lake remained popular, especially as gyms closed, during the pandemic restrictions. While the city’s restrictions specifically allowed for outdoor exercise, it was difficult to practice social distancing in the more congested areas of the trail.
Congress Avenue, stretching from south Austin directly to the Texas State Capitol in the heart of Downtown, sits empty on a Tuesday evening in late April.
Anthony Lu wore a face mask in public, as mandated by the city, matching the creatures painted on the historic Carrington Building behind him. The bright mural by Mother Marfa, Jomau, and Bunce was also created for the HOPE for Health campaign and shared the messages, “Help your neighbor” and “Looking out for each other.”
The Apple Store in The Domain is typically crowded, but stood empty, with all the lights still on.
Magnolia Cafe Lake Austin, the beloved restaurant’s original location, is a local favorite that was forced to shut down permanently due to financial troubles. Austin is known for supporting local businesses like Magnolia Cafe. The famous Austin slogan, “Keep Austin Weird” is intended to promote small businesses like Magnolia Cafe, but such businesses faced unprecedented economic interruptions amidst the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Whereas spots in The Domain parking garage are usually coveted, only the top level was populated with cars, primarily those of residents, during late April.
This mural by Lady Paraffin, showing a woman wearing a mask, was also commissioned as part of the HOPE FOR HEALTH Campaign.
Around sunset, people walking, jogging, biking, or just enjoying the view can be found on the Butler Trail, many without face masks.
Another HOPE for Health mural, painted by Uloang, covered the Two Bucks bar on Sixth Street and depicted a person looking out and asking, “Is it safe?”
People were scattered across Zilker Metropolitan Park on May 3, just two days after Texas initiated its partial reopening, while still requiring social distancing. In his order, Abbott mandated that “Every person in Texas shall, except where necessary to provide or obtain essential services or reopened services, minimize social gatherings and minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household.” However, few park-goers were wearing face coverings, despite recommendations from authorities.
After May 1, Texas continued to phase its reopening, while the City of Austin maintained its stay-at-home orders, with exceptions made for essential and reopened businesses. However, the state’s early reopenings were not without consequence: the number of COVID-19 cases has continued to climb. On June 20, Texas health authorities reported more than 4,400 new COVID-19 patients across its hospitals, the ninth consecutive new high for coronavirus hospitalizations in the state. Following the spike in hospitalizations, the City of Austin extended its “Stay Home, Work Safe” order until August 15, in an effort to slow the spread of cases and hospitalization rates. As America continues reopening, Texas will need more time and care to fully return to “normal.”
