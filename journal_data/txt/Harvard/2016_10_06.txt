After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Issa Rae has a reputation for candid humor that delivers commentary on the African-American female experience—the overarching theme of her Youtube series “Awkward Black Girl.” “Insecure,” which HBO recently released on HBO GO and which will make its official premiere on Sunday, represents Rae’s transition to television. The series follows a woman in Los Angeles as she attempts to navigate work, friendship, and dating. Issa, the “awkward black girl” of “Insecure,” works for a non-profit that helps underprivileged children, but her job is nonetheless rather unfulfilling. She struggles to create meaningful connections with the students she is serving, and so her visits to LA schools often unravel into embarrassing exposés of her unconventional blackness. What is most striking about “Insecure,” however, is how charming Rae’s portrayal is. Simple and authentic, “Insecure” tackles the challenges of not conforming to societal definitions of blackness with tremendous humor and heart.
To be clear,  “Insecure as F--k,” the premiere episode of “Insecure,” is hardly without fault. In a cultural space filled with stories of 20-something friends, the show is not groundbreaking at first blush. Likewise, “Insecure as F--k” struggles to define male blackness beyond stereotypes; most of the black males in this first episode seem to conform to tropes of being “players,” generally unaware of the effects of their actions on the black females of the show. This is not a general condemnation of the show, as it is certainly possible and even likely that the romantic subplots involving Issa will explore the male experience more thoroughly, but does bring into question how the black experience can be gendered in its narratives.
What makes the show so compelling, however, is the contrast between the awkwardness of the characters and the tremendous wit and charisma with which they are played. In one particular scene, for instance, Issa speaks to a group of inner-city schoolchildren but cannot help but notice that they only want to delve into her personal life. When she reveals that she comes from a supportive family and has a college degree, a noticeable tension emerges, as expectations and reality seem to be in conflict.  Nevertheless, Rae is undeniably loveable in her portrayal of Issa. Her charisma is perhaps most evident in the closing sequence of “Insecure as F--k,” during which Issa and her best friend, Molly (Yvonne Orji), go to a nightclub to find dates. Despite her struggles to be graceful (when a potential date eludes her handshake, Issa immediately breaks out into a rendition of the robot), Issa charms the nightclub audience by rapping with surprising passion and rhythm.
The stylistic choices of director Melina Matsoukas heighten the authenticity of the show. Indeed, background shots of Los Angeles juxtaposed with Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” provide a setting that is culturally black in its richness and strong character. The show is also quite intimate. Multiple times throughout the premiere, the audience witnesses Issa’s insecurities laid out before them as Issa talks and raps to herself in front of a bathroom mirror. It is these sequences that provide insight into the struggle of a woman who feigns confidences but in reality is remarkably human—unsure of her lipstick choices, her tone of voice, her “aggressiveness.”
The true virtue of “Insecure” rests in the honesty with which it delivers. Issa Rae’s humor is wound up in the notion that we should embrace ourselves in all our weirdness. It is not in spite of awkwardness that our lives are entertaining but rather because of it.

Eva Moolchan’s new album as Sneaks, “Gymnastics,” is astonishingly short, clocking in at just over 14 minutes. Most of the ten tracks feature little more than a drum machine, a bassline, and Moolchan’s voice. The album is a work of extreme minimalism that comes together through an incredibly tight flow, making “Gymnastics” an exercise in bringing the most out of bare bones.
“Gymnastics” begins with a semi-slow drum line and a bass kick before Moolchan begins singing, and this is more or less the way the album sounds throughout. The most significant change is the opening seconds of “Figure 8,” when all you hear is a cowbell interspersed with the drums before an abrupt cutoff.  Even lyrically, the album is so bare that much of what Moolchan says amounts to little more than a series of repeated simplistic phrases. The repetition on songs like “No Problem,” has the effect of turning these simple phrases into emotionally potent lines. On other songs, however, it sounds off-putting, like Moolchan is being excessively vague or speaking like one would to a toddler. The bassline is loud and rhythmic enough to create a weird balancing effect. This effect is the album’s biggest strength.
The trancelike sound created by the meshing of the vocals and bass makes “Gymnastics” tremendously easy to get sucked into. Songs like “Down in the Woods” or “This Is” have this hypnotic effect and it turns the spoken-word-style lyrics into something incredibly evocative and impactful despite their simplicity. Here is where the simplicity of the songs gets morphed into an asset. “New Taste” is more or less a song composed of two word couplets, but the rhythm transforms it into a fountain of poetic waxing that builds to a wave of sadness at the end. Similarly, the album’s liveliest, and probably strongest, song, “X.T.Y.,” an ode to Moolchan’s anxiety, features a rumbling, jittery bass that combines with the song’s rapid semi-spoken vocals so as to create an incredibly representative picture of anxiety in action, especially as Moolchan trails out saying, “X.T.Y. makes me feel alive.”
Because of the nature of the songs, the album has a remarkably consistent flow and creates a feeling of malaise throughout. First there’s the song that hates on double standards (“Tough Luck”). It is followed by the aforementioned “X.T.Y.” and “No Problem,” which are orchestrated such that the listener is left with a feeling of uneasiness by the time “Down in the Woods” starts.  The album has a sort of similar sound throughout—akin to a darker and more musically restricted “Spiderland” by Slint.  Although there is an uneasy progression to a less unhappy end, the bass is murky enough to make a listener question the feelings of the last few songs.  Furthermore, although the end is brighter, the music still has the same trancelike effect that it has had throughout the rest of the album.
At the album’s energetic peaks, Sneaks is reminiscent of X-Ray Spex on “Oh Bondage Up Yours!” On “X.T.Y.” this is especially true, where Moolchan’s singing is similar to that of a more restrained version of Poly Styrene. On the other end of the album’s energy, Moolchan sounds like Courtney Barnett on songs like “An Illustration of Loneliness (Sleepless in New York)”—both in the energy and in the outward simplicity of the lyrics during the album’s calmest moments. Of course, there are countless potential comparisons to make to “Gymnastics,” but the real question is whether or not Sneaks is close to living up to them. As intriguing as the album is, the answer seems to be no. “Gymnastics,” for all its strengths, is too simplistic and far too monotonous to be a truly great album. Nonetheless, it is a weird, quietly intense album that is immensely fascinating for a listen.

Science is objective. The scientific process is rigorous, involving hard data and empirical observations. And, as a result, the conclusions are objectively factual. For example: Gravity exists. The Earth moves around the Sun. Evolution is the process by which different kinds of living organisms developed and diversified from earlier forms. Women are biologically inferior to men.
Wait, what? Charles Darwin is well-known for developing the theory of evolution. He is a little bit less known for teaching that women are biologically inferior to women.
That can’t be right. Darwin was a reputable scientist, not just some sexist bigot lurking in the comment section of The Crimson's website. And yet, the same man who gave us the theory of evolution also gave us the insight that “the average standard of mental power in man must be above that of woman."
How did hard, objective science lead Darwin to such a dangerously incorrect conclusion? It’s important to remember that Darwin lived in England from 1809 to 1882, during a time when women were not granted the same access and opportunities as men. For example, some doctors in 19th century Britain reported that studying "had a damaging effect on the ovaries, turning attractive young women into dried-up prunes." As a result, even when Oxford and Cambridge eventually opened their doors to women, many families refused to let their daughters attend, for fear that they would no longer be marriageable.
Gender norms in 19th century Britain simply did not allow women to achieve the same level of academic and professional success as their male peers. Darwin was almost certainly influenced by the social and cultural norms of his time when he came to the conclusion that women are biologically inferior to men. This, however, raises an interesting question: How objective is science?
Scientists are socialized and influenced by the same societal pressures as the rest of us. As a result, even though the scientific process tries to be as objective as possible, scientists are human beings with implicit bias, just like everyone else. Therefore, science is never purely objective—and it can even be sexist.
Even though science involves numbers and data, it is all too easy for science to slide into the realm of subjectivity. For example, it is widely accepted in the scientific community that the egg passively sits in the bodies of women while sperm race towards it, eager to be the first to implant themselves.
Yet, as anthropologist Emily Martin pointed out, this narrative does not represent the facts of biology. As a matter of fact, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the mechanical force of the sperm’s tail is not very great. Therefore, the egg isn’t passively waiting for a sperm to penetrate it—the egg actually plays an active role in capturing a sperm with its own adhesive molecules.
Not everything in science is culturally constructed, but a good portion of it is. The parallels between cultural stereotypes of male and female behavior and the behavior of the egg and the sperm are too close to be coincidental. In science textbooks, the egg is often described as passively “sweeping” or “transporting” along the fallopian tube. The sperm, in contrast, is usually described as actively swimming or propelling itself forward.
It is not likely that human reproductive scientists intentionally or consciously cast gendered perceptions onto the egg and the sperm. It is far more likely that the scientists fell prey to confirmation bias—the tendency to seek out evidence that confirms one’s preexisting beliefs, while giving less consideration to evidence that points to the contrary.
When scientists approach their work with preexisting beliefs about how female and male things should behave, they may seek out evidence that proves their preexisting beliefs and disregard evidence to the contrary. Researcher Scott Gilbert described it this way: “If you don’t have an interpretation of fertilization that allows you to look for the eggs as active, you won’t look for the molecules that can prove it.”
These skewed observations are then recorded in scientific studies, and, under the mantle of “scientific objectivity,” they escape further scrutiny. But the social implications of these findings are real and harmful. For example, there currently exists no cure for premenstrual syndrome even though nine in 10 women experience it. Meanwhile, there are five times more studies on erectile dysfunction than on PMS, even though only 19 percent of men experience erectile dysfunction. The reason for this is that some grant reviewers, who are usually men, simply do not believe that PMS exists. Grants are rarely awarded for research on PMS, and as a result women continue to suffer the painful and even potentially dangerous effects of PMS.
This is why it’s important for there to be more women—and for similar reasons, more people of color and other underrepresented groups—in STEM fields. Without competing perspectives, predominantly male scientists will continue conducting “objective” research and coming to conclusions that further marginalize these communities.
Meanwhile, we simply need to be more aware of these implicit biases. When we accept that science is not necessarily objective, and when we are more willing to be skeptical, we’ve already made significant progress.

Next Wednesday, at Yom Kippur services around the world, including multiple at Harvard Hillel, Jews will read from the book of Isaiah:
“Loosen the chains of wickedness, undo the bonds of oppression… The Lord will answer you when you call, saying, ‘Here I am’ if you remove from your midst the yoke of oppression.”
After surviving the Holocaust while watching nearly their entire families perish, my maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States. My grandfather worked his way up in the grocery and restaurant businesses. Eventually, he and my grandmother were able to purchase their own restaurant, which they then managed. My grandfather would leave his home in the Bronx before five in the morning to go to the restaurant in Lower Manhattan, not returning until after seven at night. The work was hard: He was on his feet all day in a hot kitchen, with the constant stress and demands of hungry and rushed New York City customers. But, in many ways, my grandfather fulfilled the American dream. He provided for his family; his daughter eventually earned a Ph.D. from Columbia; and he is survived by well-educated grandchildren and great-grandchildren who live in relative material comfort, and with nearly boundless career choices. His ability to achieve this depended not just on his willingness to work hard, but also on being treated fairly. My grandfather took this to heart and often told me about how important it was to him to treat his own employees well.
Motivated in part by my grandparents’ experience, when I was a rabbinical student, I directed a non-profit program, the Tav HaYosher (or “Ethical Seal”), which sought to protect the basic rights of employees in kosher restaurants. During this time, I was heartened by the restaurants I visited whose owners cared deeply for their employees; they always paid their workers on time, provided at least minimum wage and overtime pay, and provided a safe and abuse-free working environment. Some owners even paid their employees when the restaurant was closed on Jewish holidays, and there were quite a few employees who were so valued by their employers that they continued to work for them for decades.
But I also saw the dark side of the food industry: Workers paid below minimum wage, verbally abused and threatened, stolen from, and stripped of their dignity. When I would interview these workers, their sense of vulnerability was palpable and terrifying.
Thankfully, Harvard University Dining Service workers are treated far better than many of the employees I talked to in New York restaurants; they are paid on time and receive hourly wages well above the minimum required by law. Nevertheless, in speaking with HUDS workers over the past few weeks, I’ve heard a too-familiar sense of vulnerability. With an expected increase in healthcare costs for most employees, many are afraid they will be unable to take care of their families. And while hourly wages may be decent, not all employees are provided with enough hours to be considered full-time. Most employees receive work only during the academic year, forcing them to find employment elsewhere during the academic recess, a substantial hurdle as few employers are looking for employees to work only during the summer. Trying to balance the schedules of multiple part-time jobs can be nearly impossible.
For a number of employees I spoke with, the most difficult part of this labor dispute is that they are surrounded by so much wealth and so many world-class resources at Harvard, not to mention Harvard’s $35 billion endowment. The HUDS employees feel like they live in a forgotten corner of the University.
One of the central pieces of the Rosh Hashanah prayer service that we recited this week is Zichronot—“Remembrances.” This section of the liturgy repeats a refrain, taken from instances in the Bible, of God remembering. There is no traditional Jewish conception of God as one who might forget, so it seems surprising that we mention moments when God remembered. Perhaps, though, the liturgy is meant to convey the despairing power of feeling like one has been forgotten and the reciprocal healing power of knowing one is remembered.
As a token of support for the HUDS workers, to remind them that they aren’t forgotten and that they don’t shoulder their burden alone, I will be giving my salary for this week to the striking HUDS employees who work at the Hillel dining hall. I hope that students and other members of the broader Harvard community will find their own ways to demonstrate support for HUDS employees. In so doing, may we see a speedy conclusion to this dispute and may we all merit the blessing of Isaiah: “Then shall your light rise in darkness and be bright as noon.” May that light shine in every corner of the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the beginning of this term, Harvard rolled out a new program for undergraduate students interested in studying European History, Politics, and Society as an academic secondary field. Organized and planned by the Center for European Studies, the program is aimed at promoting an interdisciplinary approach to studying the subject matter, drawing on knowledge and methods of study from several disciplines.
Reactions to the creation of this secondary have been mixed. While one student expressed gratitude for the creation of this program that allows him to study European history in a way that he previously could not, the new offering is coming under fire from student leaders who are invested in promoting ethnic diversity on campus in academic offerings and beyond. These students argue that there is more significant demand for similar programs that propose to study non-Western cultures—like the newly created Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies or the Latino Studies secondary—and yet, these programs seem to be created and instituted less effectively.
We are always excited when the University provides students with more options and flexibility in their intellectual pursuits, and at this juncture, the creation of a European Studies secondary is no exception. Meanwhile, the concerns about the comparative ease with which this program has been realized are fair. It is indeed frustrating that there currently exist noticeably fewer opportunities for students to study non-Western cultures. And while this addition to the College’s European studies offerings will certainly pique the interest of some students, there are structural issues slowing down ethnic studies programs. The lack of existence of ethnic studies academic centers comparable to the Center for European Studies are certainly one such burden.
Advocates of other ethnic studies programs are understandably disappointed to see that this secondary has been created and instituted after three years of routine research, planning, and preparation. Since so many courses already offered by Harvard center on Western intellectual tradition, we understand why students are frustrated to see this part of Harvard’s undergraduate academic program continue to be perfected and expanded without parallel endeavors in other fields.
Projects of this magnitude, however, cannot be achieved overnight. Increased efforts to allocate resources to the to study other histories and cultures is a prerequisite to the creation of these programs. Harvard has long used excuses of lack of faculty and classes to support the creation of secondary fields and classes in other ethnic studies. Going forward, Harvard ought to increasingly invest its resources in them so that this excuse is no longer viable.
The process should be one of collaboration, rather than opposition. The creation of fields of study is not a zero-sum game.

To the Editor,
We read The Crimson’s editorial, Recognizing Undocumented Students at Harvard, with interest.
As you correctly acknowledge, Harvard College’s policies regarding undocumented students are very straightforward—simply put, we do not take account of immigration status in any part of our admissions process, including recruitment, acceptance, and financial aid.
On the topic of financial aid, we wanted to provide some additional context for how aid is awarded to undocumented students. As you point out, undocumented students are not eligible for federal aid, and we would not want to put them through the process of filling out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) unnecessarily. But they can still receive grant aid from Harvard, and so, like international students, undocumented students fill out a College Scholarship Service profile, but not the FAFSA. It is important to note that at Harvard, domestic and international students are eligible for the exact same need-based financial aid, but the sources of this financial aid are different and require different application forms.
Additionally, all students on financial aid, including undocumented students, can apply to receive additional funding through Harvard’s Beneficiary Aid Program, which provides additional financial assistance to students facing emergency term-time costs that will prove to be an extreme financial hardship for their families. Any student experiencing financial difficulty is encouraged to visit the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid to speak with a financial aid officer, so we can extend our support.
Finally, we would underscore the College’s resources for undocumented students, beyond those referenced in your editorial. The College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion helps direct students to advisers and counselors in the Bureau of Study Counsel, the Office of Career Services, Harvard’s International Office, the Student Employment Office, and University Health Services—all of whom can assist them.
Harvard supports all of our students.
Sincerely,Marlyn McGrath and Sally Donahue
Sally Donahue is the Griffin Director of Financial Aid at Harvard College. Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73 is the Director of Admissions at Harvard College.

To the editor:
Millions of Americans, including many in my hometown, will vote for Donald J. Trump in November. Several million will do so because they believe Trump has the answers to their material problems, and because they have valid grievances with the American political system. Regardless of whether those reasons are based in reality, I consider it unfair to condemn all Trump supporters to the so-called basket of deplorables. However, I do consider it fair to condemn certain justifications for supporting Donald Trump. Namely, I write to condemn wholeheartedly a reason put forward in the recently published op-ed, "In Defense of Donald Trump." The author of this article claims that Trump "actively gathers support by reawakening a sense of pride in the identity each of us has as an American," and that Trump's policies "strike a deep and patriotic chord with their connotation of national strength." Most troublingly, the author suggests that Trump's campaign "does not signify a lack of compassion for foreigners," but rather fights to prevent a "socialistic infringement on the American Dream."
To the author of this article, and to those who agree with it, I pose one simple question: where do you find the audacity to dream on behalf of your compatriots?
The author invokes the founding myth when defining such malleable topics as national identity, patriotism, and the American Dream. But the American Dream is intentionally difficult to define because it is a set of aspirations that vary from person to person. Propped up by a near-irrelevant Patrick Henry quote, the author stains the myth of the American Dream with toxic notions of white nationalism and global domination. By arguing that Donald Trump inspires patriotism and pride in American identity, the author implies that Trump's dissenters are un-American. Their national pride is invalid, and they don't want America to be "great." Further, the author implicitly links American nationalism to white nationalism, and therefore to the ideology of white supremacy. The author brushes aside Trump's xenophobia, which is dwarfed by the greater goal of making America "great." Minorities and dissenters are not enemies to be vanquished on the path to everlasting glory; they are key to our national identity.
As long as we share an American mythos, it must be used for good. I caution Trump apologists against venturing down the well-trodden and dark path of fervent nationalism. As current struggles for civil rights demonstrate, our history trails only so far behind us. We must recognize and indeed treasure the idea that not all Americans want the same thing for their country and for their life. We must recognize that these myths are malleable for a reason: they can be and have been summoned in support of unjustified wars, imperialistic geopolitical schemes, and violence against minorities here at home.
And above all, we must recognize that one person's American Dream is another's waking nightmare.

Gray, drizzly weather calls for a trip to the library—and, by a stroke of pure luck, the City-Wide Friends of the Boston Public Library book sale took place on a horrendously damp day. The library was a glowing beacon of warmth, knowledge, and oversized lion statues in the midst of spitting rain.
I happily jogged up the stone steps to explore the sale’s contents. Following the soggy paper signs that merrily advertised the bimonthly sale, I wandered into an elevator and headed for the third floor. After a wrong turn into a reading room that must have been deadly silent for the past 15 years, I took a left at the two printing presses lurking in the hallway and emerged into a cathedral-like atrium. Despite the wholly secular environment of the library, the vaguely religious murals covering the ceiling did not feel particularly out of place. Rather, they complemented the near-evangelical enthusiasm of the book devotees in the room beyond the atrium.
I had brought a book-loving friend for company as we perused the stacks, but as it turned out, she was more of a sacrifice than a companion. Not a minute after we entered the book sale, I had lost sight of her glaringly red raincoat amidst the throngs of people and paperbacks, so I resigned myself to a solitary browsing experience.
In a space only slightly larger than a classroom, the organized chaos of the book sale provided a stark contrast to the elegant architecture and tidy information desks of the library itself. Walls were lined with shelves; countless tables were piled high with books; carts carried heaps of novels. The themes of these groupings were vague at best: I spotted shelves packed with garden-variety fiction, poetry, romance, and foreign-language books. The BGLTQ sections boasted a wide range of SAT prep books, and the “oldies” cart included some questionable selections like “Homemaking for Teenagers: Book 2 Revised” and “Tropical Holland.”
A shelf labeled “browsing” boasted an even more diverse variety than its fellows, containing not only Nicholas Campion’s “The Practical Astrologer” but also the “Great Book of Baseball Cards,” the ever-helpful “Freshwater Fish and River Creatures” guide, and “You Are Being Lied To.”
Strange categorical choices aside, the book sale was the literary equivalent of going thrifting: You can find something specific if you’re willing to put in the effort, but it’s far more fun to see what you stumble upon. Most patrons of the book sale shared this mindset. I noticed several shopping baskets (provided by Shaw’s) filled to the brim. While some of those baskets centered around a theme (I spied a dangerous number of romance novels in one), most were eclectic collections.
The same can be said of the book sale’s clientele. Teenagers, parents with young children, elderly women, and bewildered-looking people who might have been lost perused the stacks of books together. College students were particularly frequent patrons—it’s hard to beat $1 paperbacks and $2 hardcovers, after all.
Indeed, the charm of the book sale lay as much in the discovery as it did in the hunt. I have no justification for buying books, but I’m now the proud owner of a glossy-paged tome of Mary Cassatt’s feathery Impressionist paintings. The works of one of my favorite artists take on a distinctly more personal quality when bound in a green fabric hardcover rather than in frames on museum walls. A stamp on the endpapers states that the book is “no longer the property of the Boston Public Library,” so I knew that I should give it a new home.

It’s College Night at the Museum of Science, and the place is packed. Despite bad weather, there are easily several hundred people wandering among the exhibits, shiny dinosaur badges pinned to their chests.
“I’m here because my friends dragged me here,” Jon O’Brien, an undergraduate at Emmanuel College, says. Also, “it’s free.”
“Weirdo,” I mutter as I walk away. “Science is cool.”
I love going to museums. As a kid, I rubbed my nose against every glass-covered case, mesmerized by the life-sized animals, dinosaurs, and fossils. I tried all the interactive displays, from dizzying visual illusions to tingling tests of hot/cold tolerance. Museums were places I could feel knowledgeable when viewing a few exhibits, gaze in wonder at many others, and leave with more questions than answers.
Standing in the museum tonight, watching a baby chicken pecking its way out of its shell and into life, all the old mystery and excitement comes rushing back.
I begin with the “animal smells” exhibit (picture a long board with scent bottles the size and shape of saltshakers). Apparently, “eau de moose” is kind of musty. “Eau de beaver” smells strangely of cinnamon. “Eau de bear” smells like it’s time to move on.
Next I stand on my tiptoes, watching the live presentations offered by the museum staff. A porcupine waddles bow-legged around the stage. A Van de Graaff generator three stories tall creates lightning loud enough to deafen you from 20 yards away. Families of stuffed rats frolic inside a miniature sewer system.
Finally, I move to the human interactive exhibits. I put on a special wristband, scan my barcode, and begin testing, moving from station to station. Turns out, my skin color index is a 76. My oxygen saturation level is a 98. And my cholesterol level­—well, ignorance was bliss. Thanks, science.

Around the age of nine, I conjured up an elaborate future for myself. In that ever-so-boring hour between lying down and falling asleep—long before I had an iPhone to keep me entertained, and long after I learned that counting sheep is fruitless—I used to imagine scenes from my adulthood and replay them over and over in my head.
In one version of the story, I surged to stardom on American Idol before I turned 18. In another version of the story, I published the many novels that I penned in elementary school, way back when WordPerfect was still my word processor of choice. In a third version of the story, I became a red-carpet sensation after a film producer plucked me from obscurity to play Elphaba in a cinematic adaptation of “Wicked.”
In each version of the story, I married a man—nay, a dreamboat—named Zach Gold. Many little kids fantasize about their eventual romances and weddings, but between my inability to sleep and my unfettered imagination, my musings about my personal Prince Charming became far more specific than most.
I knew his hair color (dark brown) and his twin brother’s name (Matthew) and the design of my wedding dress (poofy skirt, sparkly bodice, sweetheart neckline) and the name of our first kid (Isabella Rose) and the name of our second kid (Penelope Anne) and the way he addressed letters to me (“Dear E”) and his favorite breakfast (pancakes).
My story was thorough, and it was fabulous.
Zach Gold and I met in the fall of our freshman year of college. I initially envisioned that we met in the university library as we reached for the same book. Standing on opposite sides of the bookshelf, our fingers brushed as they landed on the book’s spine; we shared a chuckle and a knowing glance as we decided who should check out the book first. At some point, the story morphed, and we instead met when we landed spots in the same a cappella group.
A few weeks into our wild love affair, Zach Gold revealed to me that his father was in fact the governor of California. In the scene I envisioned, I spit out my drink on the generic collegiate lawn on which he told me this news. A few years into our wild love affair, Zach Gold’s father ran for and—of course, since nothing ever went wrong in my ridiculous reveries—won the presidency of the United States. Maybe 2016 wouldn’t be such a shitshow if Jonathan Gold were here to knock some sense into everybody.
Zach Gold and I were inseparable throughout college. For our first anniversary, he serenaded me with Paul McCartney’s “Silly Love Songs” as our a cappella group harmonized lightly in the background. For our third anniversary, he treated me to dinner and a show in the Big Apple. Two months after we graduated from college, Zach Gold flew to Paris—where I was, obviously, filming my next Oscar-winning masterpiece—and proposed to me atop the Eiffel Tower. Gentlemen, take notes.
On Valentine’s Day in 2019, we tied the knot on the lawn of the White House under a chuppah—which is what you do when your father-in-law is the first Jewish president. After we moved to our mansion in Los Angeles, we raised our four to six children, and my singing/writing/acting career continued to thrive. In retrospect, I am proud that my nine-year-old self tied her happiness as much to her professional pursuits as she did to her love life.
Why Zach? When I started spinning these tales, High School Musical had recently become an overnight hit. On the mean streets of Thomas Fitzwater Elementary School, there were few sex symbols sexier than Zac Efron.
Why Gold? Emily Gold seemed like a glitzier stage name than Emily Zauzmer. I needed to be prepared when Hollywood offers started flowing in after my runaway success in “Wicked”—duh.
Many of the milestones I thought up a decade ago have now come and gone. All the dates I decided upon circa 2006 seemed so very distant as to be unreachable when I first spelled them out. When no knight in shining armor galloped into my a cappella auditions freshman year, I thought back to my childhood pipedreams and to a tenacious little girl who would be rather disappointed. “Zach Gold has about 10 minutes left,” I texted an old friend as I awaited my final audition on a red plastic chair in Lowell Lecture Hall.
A lot of milestones that I never thought of have come true in the meantime. I never guessed that I would go to Harvard and meet so many wonderful friends. I did not predict that I would spend delightful summers in New York City and Los Angeles. I could not have known that my concentration would allow me to write about the Kardashians, or that the Kardashians would even be a thing. (I wish I had known that the Kardashians would be a thing. I would be so much wealthier right now.)
I think there is value in setting goals for the future, and I think there is value in living in the moment. Back then, I spent a lot of time setting goals for the future. Right now, I like to spend my time living in the moment. But hey, if you’re named Zach Gold and live within a 50-mile radius of Cambridge, call me.

Walking through the gate of Boston’s first annual Barktoberfest at SoWa Open Market, our senses were overwhelmed with the sight of puppies in cute, dainty vests, the smell of freshly brewed beer, and the savory tastes of food truck delicacies. Along with the anticipated doggie costume contest, the pet parade for doggie contestants, and the cornhole tournament, we cannot help but feel highly spirited despite the gloomy sky and the slight drizzle.
The SoWa Power Station, originally a looming industrial power plant, has been repurposed into a large community space. Its brick facade provides a hipster backdrop that appeals to those of us who like to flaunt our interesting escapades via instagram. Every Sunday from May 1 to Oct. 30, the Power Station houses a Beer and Wine Garden open to the public.
This Sunday, however, the alcohol is coupled with canines and a cause. The Boston Barktoberfest is not just an excuse to have a few beers with our best four-legged canine friends, but also serves to raise awareness and funds for sheltered dogs at the Animal Rescue League.

“We wanted a really fun environment for people to enjoy and hang out with their dog,” Elizabeth Dobrska, the co-chair of the Young Professionals group of the Animal Rescues League of Boston, explains as she attempted to keep her own rescue dog—a Chihuahua named Michu—warm under her jacket. “Who can ask for more during October?”
Dobrska, who is sporting a pair of Chihuahua earrings, explains that she has been involved with the Animal Rescue League for more than 5 years. She and her co-chair, Diana Z. Akelman, started the Young Professional group three years ago. In addition to Barktoberfest, the Young Professional group also organizes the Dog Treat Decorating Party and the annual Kitten Shower in June.
Dobrska describes Barktoberfest as a great success. “Selling out is the largest indicator of that,” she says. “Lots of smiles. Lots of happy dogs... We’re very happy.”
One avid dog lover, Anna F. O’Hara (accompanied by her chocolate lab Meadow), describes their first Barktoberfest as “absolutely amazing.” Meadow entered the costume contest as a hot dog, and the two of them were thrilled to find out that Fish and Bone, Meadow’s “favorite pet store,” was sponsoring Barktoberfest. Anna says she is “normally at every single dog event in the greater Boston area.”
O’Hara’s companion Kim Sokmensuer mentioned that she enjoyed the “low key” environment that surrounded Barktoberfest. Sokmensuer agreed that the whole experience, “the people, the dogs, the food, the beer, the environment,” was an amazing way to enjoy a Sunday afternoon and support the local animal shelter.

My Uber driver drops me off a few miles outside campus. As I hurry out of his red Volkswagen Passat, he smiles sympathetically.
When I look out over Mount Auburn Cemetery, I realize my Uber driver had taken pity on me because he believed I am here to mourn.
Fortunately, I am not here to grieve a loved one’s passing. In fact, quite the opposite—I’m here to celebrate a life. Dr. Nancy A. Rappaport, a professor at Harvard Medical School, is performing a one-woman show, “Regeneration,” about her experience battling breast cancer.
The show chronicles her diagnosis, surgery, and recovery through a combination of poetry, direct-address monologues, and impersonations. It’s also, in a sense, “a love letter to Mount Auburn,” Rappaport says. “I [had been] feeling vulnerable and frightened and Mount Auburn is this very tranquil, reassuring place where I found I was less frightened about what I couldn’t predict was going to happen to me.”
The show focuses on Rappaport’s cancer, though many of the events in her life seem worthy of artistic exploration: She’s an accomplished child psychiatrist and two-time author. She introduced trailblazing methods in Cambridge public schools that gained popularity nationwide. Early in her career, she made a documentary about her work that received an Oscar nomination.
Rappaport acknowledges that she has a unique relationship with death, though she believes the subject to be universal. “The one thing that is a human condition is that we’re going to die. And we spend a lot of our lives [not thinking] about that, because it’s an unbearable thought,” she explains. “I’m not embracing the idea that I’m going to die. If I died tomorrow, I’d be wicked pissed.” Rappaport says that her diagnosis allowed her to take this risk of exploring a topic that others shy away from.
Rappaport’s subject matter is almost as brazen a choice as the medium through which she presented it. The last time she performed was as the Wicked Witch of the West—in seventh grade. So why a play? “I’ve always wanted to do community theater, and I thought, maybe I can turn this into a one-woman show,” she says.
Performing this play not only helped her deal with her past trauma, but also educated her. “I think it’s a life lesson… this idea that in order to get through [to people] when you’re acting, you have to be completely present in the moment you’re in,” she says. “If you’re thinking about the next scene that you have to do, you’re screwed because the audience is also distracted. And it felt really grounding to learn that discipline.”
This experience has made Rappaport approach her work as a doctor differently.  She has concluded that “the moments that you’re with a patient shape how a patient feels.” When a doctor is in the moment with a patient, that doctor is doing “sacred work,” she says.
Rappaport maintains this optimism both on and offstage, but also acknowledges the frightening reality of events in her life.  “I’m 100 percent recovered,” she tells the audience, “and we’re all terminal.”

Jeremy M. Rossen, assistant curator at the Harvard Film Archive (HFA), wants to bring more students to 24 Quincy St.
“Sometimes it’s like you get caught in your own little circle, and you forget about the greater world around you,” Rossen laments.
He notes that at a recent showing of the film “Coffee” at the archive, the HFA’s 185-seat theater was filled nearly to capacity.
“We have our core audience, and we would like to explore and get more of a student audience, and get more of a dialogue,” Rossen says. “We want diversity, and we would like to show to the widest audience possible.”
The HFA, according to Rossen, possesses more than 3,500 works in a number of genres, and tries to choose showings to reflect that diversity. “We don’t just pick one genre,” Rossen says. “We like to have a balance.”
Right now, the archive is preparing to launch its upcoming screen series “Say it Loud! The Black Cinema Revolution,” which will focus on the socio-political issues concerning people of color in the 1970s.
The series will include selections from
“American Black Journal,” a television  show created in 1968.
According to Rossen, the show’s co-producer, Kent Garrett ’63, will come to the Harvard Archive to show a selection of his works.
Garrett, a documentarian, has worked on a number of films since his time on “American Black Journal,” covering subjects from African American police officers to the Vietnam War.
Rossen believs that Garrett’s work will resonate with a contemporary audience. “Garrett, one of 19 African Americans to be admitted to Harvard in 1959, is currently making a film called “Last Negroes at Harvard.”
While Rossen hopes to draw more visitors with the upcoming series, he also emphasizes that the HFA already has a strong following.
“The lights were dimmed and it felt like a fun atmosphere, and everybody seemed to be really excited, and there was clapping afterwards,” Rossen says. “Hopefully that momentum will continue on through the series and to some of the lesser political documentaries.”

“Should I smile, or should I be serious? How do you want me to look for the photo?”
“Whatever feels most comfortable.”
“This piece was inspired by Indigenous People’s Day, right?”
I nod.
“Well, then I’ll smile.”

SaNoah S. LaRocque ’19 is a traveler. Before arriving at Harvard last fall, she had attended 13 different schools and lived in towns, cities, and Native-American reservations across the United States. When I ask why, she jokes: “My mom was always a bit of a rebel, you could say.”
Despite her nomadic background, LaRocque has always feel connected to her roots, even while away from the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in North Dakota that she now calls home. “My Native-American heritage is an important part of me wherever I am, no matter what I’m doing,” LaRocque says. “In my culture, we call this continent Turtle Island, and everywhere on Turtle Island has always been our home. I don’t need to be in a particular place to feel Native or indigenous.”  As part of her desire to stay connected to her home, LaRocque got a tattoo of North Dakota prairie flowers on her forearm. They’re a common sight on the reservation where she lives.
At the same time, LaRocque describes a significant cultural disconnect between her experience growing up and her experiences thus far at Harvard and on the East Coast.
“Back home, there are a lot of Native people around, a lot of Native culture is represented,” she says. “You see a lot less of that here, which is sad. Not in and of itself, but because the reason that we see a lot less of Native-American culture here is because it was forcibly assimilated or destroyed.”
But, LaRocque says, that has been a “motivator for the Native community as well—there are a lot of Native students here doing so many great, inspiring things, in spite of and to counter that cultural erasure.”
LaRocque herself has never shied away from fighting on behalf of Native American culture and identity. In high school, she wanted to wear an eagle feather on her graduation cap, but school regulations barred students from decorating their caps or gowns. LaRocque appealed, explaining that the feather wasn’t simply a decoration, but an important symbol of her cultural beliefs. She won, and  during the summer that followed, First Lady Michelle Obama shared LaRocque’s story at the Tribal Youth Gathering at the White House.
When I ask LaRocque why she thinks that the movement to recognize Indigenous People’s Day—both at Harvard and more broadly—is important, she pauses for a moment. “A lot of people criticize the movement in support of Indigenous People’s Day, and say it’s a change for change’s sake. That’s not the case. Indigenous People’s Day is about promoting awareness, promoting context, for a history that has for so long been so one-sided.”
For LaRocque, who participated and performed as a dancer in the Indigenous People’s Day celebration at Harvard last year and will do so again next week, the celebration is not just a historical observation, but an expression of the identity of Native culture that lives on today:
“Indigenous People’s Day brings Native issues to the forefront, and tells everyone, tells ourselves, that we are still here and that we’re not going anywhere.”

“Do you know about Caleb?”
It’s 9 a.m. in Annenberg, and the dining hall is full of students eating and working before class. Damon J. Clark ’16 wears a Harvard t­-shirt, his long black hair twisted neatly behind his head in a traditional string fastener called a tsiyeel.
He’s gesturing across the dining hall at the portrait of Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, Class of 1665, who was the first Native American to graduate from Harvard. Cheeshahteaumuck’s portrait was added to Annenberg in 2010 as part of the Harvard Foundation Portraiture Project, which aims to bring diversity to Harvard’s notoriously homogenous portrait collections by honoring people of color who have played important roles in the University’s history.
For Clark, president of Native Americans at Harvard College, this kind of representation is crucial.
“Image matters, the mention of Native Americans matters,” Clark says. “Because most times at Harvard, I’ve been the first Native American that anyone has ever met.”
Clark is Diné, the preferred name for the group of indigenous people classified by the United States Government as Navajo, a label which Clark points out has a complicated history (the term “Navajo” was initially a derogatory term applied to the peoples inhabiting parts of present­day New Mexico). In fact, there’s little about Native American identity that isn’t complicated by history, says Clark.
“There are 567 federally recognized tribes right now, and we don’t have the same language, we don’t have the same culture, we don’t have the same background, we don’t have the same looks,” he says. “We have nothing similar except our relationship to the United States government.”
Clark is a part of Near the Water Clan, a designation passed down through generations of his family on his mother’s side, in keeping with the Diné’s matriarchal tradition.
His home in Assayii, New Mexico, a place named for the red rock of the canyons there, is starkly different from the halls of Harvard. “We live where the pavement ends,” Clark says with a laugh. “Literally, there’s a road that’s called ‘The Road to Nowhere’, and I live further on.”
His family lives without running water and only solar­powered electricity, growing traditional crops like corn and squash (but also, Clark notes, trendier greens like kale, because “culture isn’t static”). When he’s home, Clark is a farmer.
“[Home] provides a whole different lifestyle,” Clark says. “I’m able to have fresh air, and it’s so quiet, the very opposite of Cambridge. I know that when I go home, that’s where my family is, and that’s who I am.” A part of that identity is rooted in Clark’s great-­great­grandfather, Chief Manuelito, who led resistance efforts against the forcible relocation of the Diné and helped broker an 1868 treaty that secured a reservation for them. That legacy looms large for Clark. 
In part because of this history, Clark sees himself as a “public servant,” working actively to increase representation and advocacy for Native Americans on campus and beyond. Last year, Clark was part of a group of students who petitioned for Harvard to recognize Navajo as a foreign language; a Navajo language  course was offered by the University for the first time last spring. Clark, who is not fluent in Navajo but can smoothly introduce himself , says that language—like preservation of the Diné’s matriarchal society and traditional farming practices—is a “key” to living the culture of his people.
Clark and the wider NAHC’s goals at Harvard extend well beyond language instruction. Right now, the group is actively petitioning for the University to officially adopt Indigenous Peoples’ Day as a replacement for Columbus Day, a move already taken by the City of Cambridge and peer institutions including Brown.
“This movement is really about reclaiming an indigenous identity. A lot of the students feel like not only are we not celebrated, we’re not even mentioned,” Clark says.
He’d also like to see more of an academic presence for indigenous people, from full-­time indigenous faculty to the formation of a Native American Studies program.
Though his adopted role in advocating for Native Americans at Harvard can be difficult, Clark says, it’s not a choice. “I have to talk about Native Americans,” Clark says. “To tell this narrative, not only my personal narrative, but also the Native American narrative—that’s difficult.”
“But if I do not present that, who else will?”

Face-down in the rain with my elbows in the mud of Eliot House Courtyard was not how I thought I’d be starting my Saturday morning. But here I am, completing the “final plank” of FABS, a weekly core-focused exercise class led by Eliot resident tutor Brandon R. Tilley.
Long ago, the class began as a former tutor’s private ab routine. Gradually, it took on the name FABS and started being advertised over the Eliot House email list. Tilley first attended the class as a student, but only did so sporadically. “I wasn’t a die-hard,” he says. Eventually, however, he grew “more and more into it” and eventually took over the class as teacher.
FABS is an hour-long class separated into five minute intervals. Three minutes into the warm up of sit-ups, scissor kicks, and toe touches, and many people are already beginning to sweat. We then continue on to a series of workouts including squat jumps, burpees, and Russian twists with weights.
Originally, the class was much less organized. According to Tilley, class-goers would show up and “we’d be like ‘what should we do now? Who has an idea?’” Over the past few years, he has introduced a much more  rigid plan. FABS has tuned “into a machine.”
“I do hope not to kill people,” Tilley jokes. “[But] I really hate it when, like, some athlete   comes and they just like breeze right through it and it’s not hard for them.”
According to Tilley, the vast majority of FABS attendees are Eliot House affiliates—including several tutors and one house administrator.
However, some brave souls do make the inter-house trek as well. Turnout is always the greatest in the first week, when students have a “New Year’s resolution-type grit,” Tilley says.
People don’t just come for the workout though—they say it creates a nice community as well. For Sarah J. Farina ’17, who has been coming to FABS for a year, the social aspect of the class is a huge draw.
“I like it because I have friends who come and do it too. We get to hang out and then we get breakfast together,” she says. Last year, a group of FABS fanatics graduated, so this year’s “core group” is still emerging.
Tilley, who recently completed his Ph.D. dissertation on medieval poetry, finds that he gets more out ofteaching FABS than just the physical benefits.
“[FABS] breaks up the stress and monotony, or the loneliness, of writing my dissertation,” he says. And though this is likely Tilley’s last year leading FABS, he has a list of people in mind who could take over for him when he steps down.
Until then, Tilley will continue to encourage as many people as possible to plank in the Eliot House mud.

The shops of Central Square embody Cambridge’s quirky spirit. This often under-explored stretch of Mass. Ave. is an eclectic collection of restaurants, specialty stores, and, of course, book stores. Up the staircase of one small storefront at 550 Mass. Ave. is a particularly revolutionary spot: The Center for Marxist Studies.
Originally established in 1974 as a campaign headquarters for the Communist Party member and senate candidate Laura Ross, the Center now operates as a bookstore and educational center, holding classes, workshops, and lectures. If you haven’t heard of it, don’t worry—it’s only open three hours a week.

There aren’t many faces in the store when we walk in, except for posters featuring Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx. We do get the chance to talk to Donald Donato, one of the Center’s staffers. This leftist center is a time capsule full of books, artwork, and posters that take visitors back to another era.
Donato believes that the bookstore’s programming is very relevant to citizens of Massachusetts. The Center has hosted events with Black Lives Matter activists and the Committee for International Labor Defense. “We don’t have any illusions about having a revolution and taking over DC,” he says.

J. Cedric Woods, a member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, is a professor at University of Massachusetts Boston and director of their Institute for New England Native American Studies (INENAS). He is currently serving as one of Pforzheimer House’s Native American fellows.
FM: How did you become involved in INENAS?
CW: At least two years before I got to the Institute, the funding source was there and they were doing some programming, but they realized to really get things up and moving, they needed a staff person. I had just finished up my Ph.D. not terribly long before that at University of Connecticut and was seriously considering a transition to academia for my work in tribal government administration.
FM: What is INENAS’ mission?
CW: The original mission—and it hasn’t changed—is to connect regional native communities with university innovation, education, and research. That is intentionally very broad... Some of the things that rank very high in terms of the [Native American communities’] concerns were issues of educational disparities, socioeconomic disparities, health disparities. I am an institute of one—I am the only staff person at the institute and so in order to achieve this very broad mission... I have to collaborate and work well with others. I haven’t changed the mission, but certainly have worked to expand it.
FM: Why do you think it’s important to connect these communities with university research?
CW: Tribes need data, like any other community, to successfully deal with whatever particular challenge or developing long-term plans—it’s all informed by data. Having culturally competent researchers is critical for that process to work. I’ve served a role as much as anything else as a cultural broker to help form relationships between [the native communities and] researchers on my campus—people of good will who want to do things to assist and benefit native communities.
FM: How has your Ph.D. research played into your current work?
CW: My dissertation was a comparative study looking at the evolution of tribal government structures at the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and Mashpee Wampanoag tribe. That seems somewhat esoteric, but I actually think it’s foundational in the sense that it prepared me to understand the variability and fluidity as far as structures internal to tribal communities and how those change over time. The change isn’t necessarily a bad thing, you just have to adapt your model to fit it. It definitely informs how I approach working with native communities.
FM: What kind of challenges do natives in Massachusetts face that are specific to this state, and that INENAS strives to address?
CW: A lot of the contemporary issues are directly tied to the Massachusetts Enfranchisement and Allotment Act, when the state took very intentional actions to break up tribal land holdings. And the ongoing consequences of that are still felt to this day. There was the Indian Imprisonment Act in the city of Boston [which] was not repealed until 2005. It had been on the books from 1675 to 2005, making it illegal for people like me to be within the city boundaries of Boston. So if you want to talk about an ability of the city and the Commonwealth to essentially forget or ignore what was going on with native people, I’d say that’s a pretty good representation. With lots of talk about being progressive and being concerned about rights and individuals, it frequently did not apply to native folks, because native folks didn’t make it on the radar.
FM: What research have you seen on disparities in educational outcomes between natives and non-natives?
CW: In a nutshell, native youths do not finish high school at the same rates as their non-native classmates. They certainly don’t finish college at the same rates—fewer go in, and fewer come out. And so even when you get to the pipeline for academia, I’m pretty sure that the number of Native American Ph.D.’s has declined in the last 2-3 years while everyone else has continued to increase.
FM: What about health disparities?
CW: It runs the gamut. Health disparities research is not my area of expertise, but it’s something that I certainly engage with in developing a process and a model across these communities... I worked with several native consultants here in the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services from the state of Massachusetts in developing a guide for native parents to talk to their teens about substance abuse. This is a state agency developing the document, recognizing that they didn’t have anything that spoke to the native community, pulled in native artists, quotes from native elders, native consultants to develop something that was reflective and designed to build relationships with this particular community.
FM: Do you see issues in the way Native American history is taught in schools? How should it change?
CW: I recently was appointed to the curriculum review committee for the state for the Department for Elementary and Secondary Education... The way it’s taught generally in most schools heightens the sense of... invisibility with native people as being something that is historic but not contemporary. We had a mother of a native child in a public school district talking about invisibility and its negative impact on her daughter to the point where they moved school districts... It’s a variety of factors, it’s an issue of what is the curriculum, and I’ve done some teacher training workshops engaging with teachers on particular topics related to how... you teach about native peoples,  and the challenge is—the instructors will tell you—we didn’t get this in college. If they don’t get it there, they can’t teach the kids what they don’t know, unless they are able to participate in one of these workshops.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 5, 2016, at 9:46 p.m.
Hundreds of Harvard’s dining service workers began picketing early Wednesday morning, commencing a historic strike precipitated by months of tense—and thus far fruitless—negotiations with the University.
The workers’ strike marks the first time they have walked off the job during the academic year, according to Brian Lang, president of UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based labor union that represents HUDS. The strike is the first walk out Harvard has seen since 1983, according to Lang.
HUDS workers picketed outside of dining halls and stationed four RVs in the Harvard area as “mobile strike centers.” At 9 a.m., roughly 600 workers rallied in the Science Center Plaza, according to Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck, eventually marching to Massachusetts Hall, where University President Drew G. Faust's office is located.
According to Lang, around 500 dining service employees checked into picket lines across the campus as of about 8 a.m. using strike identification cards. There are about 750 total HUDS workers.
Lang and Ten Eyck also confirmed that as of about 8 a.m. they were not aware of any dining services workers that had reported for work.
Local 26 negotiator Michael Kramer gave opening remarks at the rally, calling for an increase in HUDS employees’ wages. “At this, the richest university in the world, no worker that is here and that is ready work should be making less than $35,000 a year,” he said.
Anabela A. Pappas, a HUDS worker stationed in Pforzheimer and Cabot Houses, followed Kramer. She said that HUDS employees would rather be “in the dining hall feeding the students” than outside rallying, and that Harvard had forced workers into striking.
“All the money they have, and they still want to squeeze every bit out of us,” she said. “You greedy people. This is what you caused, not us. We didn’t want to be here.” 
Over the course of the months-long bargaining—which began mid-June—Harvard and union negotiators have faced a stalemate over wages and health benefits.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has “proposed creative solutions to issues presented by the union, and hoped union representatives would contribute to finding creative, workable solutions at the negotiation table.”
She added: “They have been unwilling to do so. We are disappointed that they have been more interested in planning a strike than working on a solution that meets the needs of their members and the wider community.”
Harvard and HUDS will continue bargaining during the strike, according to Lang. He said both Local 26 and the University have established a “framework” for making progress on the negotiations. Their next session is scheduled for Thursday afternoon, according to deLuzuriaga.
Over the course of the day, HUDS employees picketed at dining halls and around Harvard Yard, carrying Local 26 signs and shouting chants. They planned to picket at 16 different locations on campus, including each of the upperclassman dining halls and Annenberg, the freshman dining hall.
Kerry Maiato, a HUDS employee who typically works in Annenberg, stood outside one of the union’s RVs while picketing.
“I feel the strike is important just off of myself and my family,” said Maiato. “I have two children, three and nine years old, and I feel like affordable health should be a basic human right that everyone is entitled to. That’s why I’m striking today, it’s for my children and my family."
“At every dining hall you do see workers and students, members of this community standing together and standing with HUDS, and I think that’s really powerful,” said Grace Evans ’19, a member of SLAM and a student in Mather House.
Other members of SLAM handed out flowers to striking workers behind Annenberg.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, who stood in front of Mather House Wednesday morning, said she sees her role today as "supporting the students in their choices."
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to undergraduates Wednesday that he believed debate over the workers’ strike was a testament to “free expression” but stressed that College affiliates should be respectful.
“As always, we want to encourage dialogue that is respectful,” Khurana wrote. “In this community — made up of students, administrative staff, faculty, residential staff, and our dining hall workers, how we treat each other in challenging times matters deeply.”
He wrote that the College's priority was its students' “health and well-being.”
Two outside mediators—Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economics professor, and Robert B. McKersie, professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School of Management—will attend additional bargaining sessions between the two parties, according to deLuzuriaga. Those same mediators also helped facilitate the 2015 negotiations between Harvard and its largest employee union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
Thus far, HUDS negotiators have demanded year-round work and a minimum salary of $35,000 for those who wish to work the whole year. In addition, HUDS has asked Harvard not raise out of pocket health costs.
In a bargaining session Monday, Harvard proposed a summer stipend that would provide HUDS workers available to work during the summer anywhere from $150 to $250 per week, “even if there are no open shifts.” The amount of the stipend would depend on the worker’s tenure at the University.
Lang said in an interview Wednesday morning that this proposal was a “step in the right direction.”
Harvard prepared for workers to strike by extending dining hall hours and closing certain facilities. In emails sent yesterday, several Faculty Deans said dining hall managers will primarily take charge during the strike. In advance of the strike, Harvard began stockpiling frozen food en masse.
The HUDS workers were joined by at least two other labor groups in their picket and rally. Aryt Alasti, a security guard, said members of SEIU 32BJ—which represents Harvard’s guards and custodians—had been encouraged to picket in support of HUDS during their off hours. Graduate student Aaron T. Bekemeyer, carrying a Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers banner, said members of the unionization effort were also supporting the HUDS workers.
“We’re all workers. We’re here in solidarity with them,” Bekemeyer said.
Additionally, in a memo sent to HUCTW employees, Bill Jaeger, the union’s executive director, pledged support to Local 26, but cautioned union members against neglecting their own work schedules to participate in the strike.
“At the same time, HUCTW is not on strike — HUCTW members are expected to report to work as scheduled on Wednesday, and to work all scheduled  hours during an Local 26 action that may take place,” Jaeger wrote.
While outside workers picketed, at least one dining hall served hot breakfast. In Lowell House, students could enjoy items such as waffles and home fries, marking the rare weekday appearance of hot breakfast in an upperclassman House.

Thirty-eight rapes were reported on Harvard's Cambridge campus in 2015, an increase from the 33 rapes reported in 2014.
With that number, Harvard leads the Ivy League in reported rapes by double digits, according to federally mandated annual reports released by each university's’ police department.
Alicia Oeser, director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, said the data may be a positive sign, potentially indicating more victims may be aware of resources available to them.
“It is impossible to say exactly what the higher numbers mean, but national data suggests that the rate of incidents has remained relatively steady over the years,” Oeser wrote in an email. “An increase in the number of reports is more reflective of a growing population as well as an increase in and awareness of resources supporting survivors.”

Cases of burglary, dating violence, and fondling at Harvard’s Cambridge campus also all increased from 2014 levels, according to the Harvard University Police Department security report released in accordance with the Clery Act.
In the Ivy League, the second highest number of reported rapes occurred at Dartmouth College, where 20 rapes were reported. By comparison, 17 were reported at Yale, seven at Princeton, and two at Cornell. One of the 38 rapes reported at Harvard was deemed to be “unfounded,” defined by HUPD as “any report of a crime that is found to be false or baseless” after an investigation by law enforcement.

The report also lists 18 total cases of fondling on the Cambridge campus in 2015, up from 10 in 2014. There were two reported cases of fondling on Harvard’s Longwood campus in Boston. Reports of dating violence, defined by HUPD as “violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim” tripled from four reports in 2014, to 12 reports in 2015.
Harvard is mandated to release crime statistics from all of its campuses, including international locations in Greece and Chile. However, there were almost no crimes reported on any campus except Cambridge and Longwood.
These statistics come a little more than a year since Harvard unveiled the results of its sexual climate survey that University President Drew G. Faust called “anguishing.” Since then, the University has engaged in a series of efforts to prevent sexual assault on campus, including unveiling a sexual assault online training module which all undergraduate students are required to complete by mid-October.
“The hope is that Harvard’s initiatives between the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response (OSAPR) and Title IX will build on each other and will ultimately lead to more successful prevention efforts, diminishing the number of incidents that occur,” Oeser wrote.
The annual Clery Act report, entitled “Playing it Safe,” was emailed to Harvard affiliates on Oct. 1 and includes three years of crime statistics from 2013 to 2015, descriptions of safety protocol, and pertinent information about HUPD and other campus offices.
Reported burglaries increased slightly on campus from 40 in 2014 to 43 in 2015. HUPD defines burglary as “the unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft.” In an email, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano encouraged Harvard affiliates to “take advantage of the services, resources, and advice on how to keep themselves and their property safe.”
Despite the total of 175 reported Clery Act crimes on Harvard’s Cambridge campus in 2015, at the report’s outset HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley wrote that while there were relatively low levels of crime on Harvard’s campuses, readers must remain vigilant.
“Although reported crime at Harvard is low (and about 93% of it is property crime), it is important for students, faculty, staff and visitors to remember we are located in an urban setting and must contend with many of the crime and safety issues that exist in the city,” Riley wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many businesses in Harvard Square experienced a large spike in customer volume during peak lunch hours on Wednesday, the first day of a historic strike by Harvard’s dining service workers.
Three House dining halls—in Cabot, Dunster, and Kirkland—ceased all operations on Wednesday morning, while dining services and hours were extended in other locations. Dean of Students Katherine G. O’ Dair outlined these changes in an email to students on Tuesday morning, following failed contract negotiations between Harvard and dining hall workers.
During the peak lunch hours, eateries along Brattle St., including Crema Cafe and Flat Patties, were packed with customers. Next door, the line to popular Mexican food joint Felipe’s Taqueria was out the door. 
“We’re insanely busy right now,” Felipe’s chef Tony Springer said. “Most Wednesdays are usually a seven on a scale of one to ten, but it is like a ten right now.”
Cabot House resident Sabrina Xiong ’19 chose to forgo lunch at another dining hall and instead found it more convenient to stop by Liquiteria, a juice bar on Mass. Ave.
“I went to Liquiteria because my house’s dining hall was closed, and so the most convenient option for me was to get healthier food in the Square,” Xiong said.
Nearby grocery store Broadway Marketplace also experienced an increase in the volume of sales this morning.
Broadway store manager George Hickey said he “definitely” noticed an increase in the number of students purchasing groceries Wednesday.
“I would say that it was between a two to five percent increase in students buying groceries during the lunch hour today,” Hickey said.
This trend could also be observed at Market in the Square, a 24-hour grocery store and deli on Church St., a store employee confirmed.
However, this surge in customers was not experienced by all eateries in the Square. Employees at The Kong, Qdoba, and Mr. Bartley’s Burger Cottage said they were not visited by an unusually large number of customers today.
Bartley’s owner Bill Bartley expected a large crowd of students at the eatery today but was surprised to find that this was not the case. He observed that today’s lunch crowd was “not student-heavy at all,” although he admitted that the burger joint’s afternoon clientele was not usually students.
“My wife even texted me to be on the heads up because three dining halls are closed,” Bartley said. “I am definitely surprised, but I mean there are a lot of options in the Square.”

UPDATED: October 6, 2016 at 3:01 p.m.
 Acclaimed philosophy professor Cornel R. West ’74 advocated for the power of continual self-examination and criticism of society during a packed event at the Science Center on Wednesday night.
With students and faculty members alike crowding into the auditorium, the event was part of a larger series organized by the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. Discussion moderator and Center for Ethics director Danielle S. Allen cited West’s ability to analyze difficult issues without devolving into personal hatred.
“West is one of the greatest analysts of race and justice in the U.S.,” she said. “He always offers a powerful message of hope, integrity, and recognition of humanity.”
The conversation covered a variety of philosophical topics, including the definition of pragmatism, the power of defining events as “catastrophes,” and the importance hope in difficult societal problems.
West defined pragmatism by differentiating it from opportunism, saying that pragmatism is not “reducible to the utilitarian.” Instead, West stressed the importance of "values, virtues, and vision" when considering pragmatism.
He urged the audience to constantly question their beliefs and presumptions.
“It’s so easy to become self-righteous in your struggle against evil,” West cautioned. “You can learn from folk you disagree with.”
During the question and answer session, multiple audience members expressed concern over acting with integrity in the face of oppression, but West reminded listeners to “acknowledge the progress” that has been made.
“A tremendous sign of hope is the younger generation,” West said. “Breakthroughs [in regards to discrimination] have been made, and the younger generation has received them.”
West, who participated in protests in April 2015 demanding that Harvard divest its endowment from fossil fuels, also expressed his support for Harvard’s dining hall workers in their strike that began on Wednesday morning.
“Of course I would endorse what is going on. We have people having robust conversations, folks putting their lives on the line,” West said. “The beautiful thing is how the young people are recognizing the crucial role these workers play in their lives.”
Both Allen and West were very complimentary throughout the event. West was a professor at Princeton in the early 1990s, while Allen was an undergraduate there. He came to Harvard in 1994 before becoming a University Professor four years later. He then returned to Princeton in 2002 following a dispute with then-University President Lawrence H. Summers.
Allen cited West, her mentor at Princeton, as the greatest difference in her life. West responded with equal praise.
“To see students soar like eagles brings a joy to your heart”, West said, referring to Allen’s success.
A crowd of audience members gathered around West after the event.
“As someone who’s never seen him speak before, he said so much in such style,” Christina M. Qiu ’19, a Crimson editorial columnist, said. “He was so open minded and kind and tolerant of all walks of life, which is so rare to see in today’s world.”
“Cornel West was very inspirational in terms of his commitment to justice and equality,” said audience member Amanda Gorman ’20, who described herself as “speechless” after the event. “His effect rippled throughout this room with his continuous promise to challenge the unjust system and critique oneself.”

College students will have to use a new two-step verification system starting Oct. 19 to access most online Harvard resources, including my.havard and Canvas.
The change follows recent updates to Harvard’s authentication systems, including the implementation of HarvardKey last spring, which required students to log into online services using new login and password credentials.
However after a network intrusion in June, Harvard has advised students to consider changing their passwords and is requiring students to activate the two-step verification system. Christian Hamer, Harvard’s chief information security officer, notified undergraduates of the impending change in an email in late September.
The new system requires students to verify themselves using another device, commonly a mobile phone, when logging into HarvardKey protected accounts. According to the HUIT website, students have the option to verify their login with each use or can select an option to  "remember me” for 30 days.
The HUIT website states that Harvard’s online services and accounts are high-priority targets for hackers, but the new system will increase security protections for direct deposit information, research data, intellectual property, and personal information.
“Two-step verification is an extra layer of security designed to ensure that you're the only person who can access your Harvard account, even if your password is stolen,” the HUIT website reads.
Several students have expressed frustration with the new system, characterizing it as inconvenient.
“I’m kind of annoyed that I have to go on my phone and use the app,” said Thang Diep ’19. “It’s an extra app on my phone that I don’t need.”
The HUIT website strongly recommends that users add a second device when setting up their two-step verification accounts, which would enable them to authenticate their logins if they don’t have access to their primary devices. However, some students perceive this added step as overly burdensome.
“It’s been surprisingly inconvenient,” said Audrey H. Effenberger ’19. “I was borrowing someone else’s computer and it was a struggle with the new system trying to get into my account.”
While the security modifications have been met with some hesitations, students said they still appreciate HUIT’s efforts to protect their information.
“I have yet to feel annoyed by the verification when in a time crunch,” said Audrey S. Thorne ’19. “It honestly doesn’t take that long and even though I don’t think I have anything worth hacking, the added security is reassuring.”
Thomas LaSalle ’19 expressed a similar mindset. “I understand that it's in our best interest for our security,” he said. “It doesn't really bother me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With most of its dining services employees chanting criticisms, wielding signs, and forming picket lines around campus, Harvard made do with roughly a fifth of its usual labor supply to feed thousands of students Wednesday.
More than 500 Harvard University Dining Services employees did not show up to work, instead launching a historic strike precipitated by months of contract negotiations with the University. Because a vast majority of its dining services employees are members of the Boston-based union UNITE HERE Local 26, Harvard turned to a motley mix of managers, temporary hires, and available University employees to serve limited  menus in the dining halls.
About 70 HUDS managers, 15 temporary hires, and 15 Harvard employees worked in the dining halls to serve meals throughout the day, according to Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga. In a statement, deLuzuriaga wrote in an email that the University often hires temporary employees to fill-in for absent HUDS employees and that there are usually more temporary workers on campus than the 15 present on Wednesday.
“On an average day, the University has many more temporary workers on campus, filling shifts that Harvard employees cannot fill,” deLuzuriaga wrote. “Harvard University Dining Services will continue to meet the needs of our students to the best of its ability for the duration of the strike.”
HUDS workers typically staff dining halls and cafes across the University, from Harvard’s Longwood campus to Annenberg Hall by the freshman dorms. But on Wednesday, three dining halls closed because of the strike, funneling students to fewer Houses.
While some outside employees did slip through HUDS’s picket lines and staffed Harvard’s dining halls, Local 26 President Brian Lang said he was not surprised or concerned that Harvard had hired additional labor.
"Look, that’s what we expected them to do. The purpose was not to completely shut down dining hall operations, but to let them know how workers really feel,” Lang said, referring to the strike. “We've been extremely successful in that way."
The strike is the culmination of months of tense negotiations between the union and Harvard. The two parties have clashed over health benefits and wages for HUDS workers, and bargaining will continue throughout the strike.
On their first day of picketing, HUDS workers and students rallied outside of dining halls and in common spaces, such as the Science Center and Harvard Yard. They began their strike at 6 a.m. and continued throughout the better part of the day.
Some students lamented the loss of the familiar faces in the dining halls. Andree M. Franco-Vasquez ’17 said she understands the need for temporary workers but hopes the HUDS employees will return soon.
“I guess it’s necessary—someone has to feed us,” she said. “ It’s also kind of shady, because I feel like it makes HUDS workers feel disposable by the University.”
It is unclear how long the HUDS strike will last, or for how long Harvard plans to staff its dining halls with temporary workers.
Dianne Lee ’20, a contributing news writer to The Crimson, said she did not recognize any of the workers in Annenberg Wednesday and that  it was strange to encounter a new worker at the check-in desk.
“Nobody really knew how today was going to go,” she said.
Michael Gao ’20 said some students he knew felt anxious about coming into contact with the picket line outside of Annenberg. However, he said he felt there was no pressure to avoid eating in the dining halls as a form of support for the strike.
For Audrey H. Effenberger ’19, her decision to eat in the dining hall was more complicated. She said that while the Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate group supporting HUDS, has, through social media posts and emails,  encouraged  students not to feel bad about eating in dining halls, she still felt some hesitation about eating in the Houses.
But, Effenberger said, she needed to eat somehow. Franco-Vasquez said she felt similarly, and said local restaurants were too expensive for her.
However, Franco-Vasquez said, her experience of eating in the dining hall on Wednesday lacked community spirit.
“ It kind of feels like an empty kitchen,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Admiral Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, discussed cyber security and political controversy surrounding the NSA at the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum on Wednesday evening.

Rogers was introduced by Graham T. Allison, director of the Belfer Center and Kennedy School professor, who brought up domestic concerns about the NSA. The Belfer Center hosted the event.
“Some Americans think that the advance of cyber capability and surveillance begins to look more and more like 1984,” Allison said.
Rogers responded that the NSA operates within the bounds of the law and that most of the public’s concern comes from power granted to the NSA under the law.
“We don’t set the law; we don’t write the law. We never deviate from that legal framework. We don’t violate the law, the power, the authority that has been granted to us,” he said. “Now are we comfortable with that legal framework? We have blurred these two issues.”
During the subsequent question-and-answer session, questions centered around the evolution of the intelligence community and cyber technology in the 21st century.
“We are in a place now where the current state of technology has outstripped our legal frameworks. How do we realign this?” Rogers said. “We need a broader societal discussion about this: what are we comfortable with?  What does privacy mean in the digital age?”
With regard to international issues, Rogers acknowledged recent high-profile hacks, such as the Sony hack in 2014—which included communications between a Harvard Overseer and top University officials—and the 2015 hack of the Office of Personnel Management.
“We must publicly acknowledge the activity. We must publicly attribute the activity,” he said. “We must take concrete action to make sure that, in [the Sony] case the North Koreans, understand that these actions are not acceptable.”
Rogers acknowledge that when someone or a foreign nation engages in cyber warfare, the automatic response is to do the same thing.
“My argument is we should think more broadly, more strategically, and harness the broad capabilities and advantages that we draw as a nation. Just don’t default to cyber,” he said.
Attendees said they were eager to hear the perspective of the director of the NSA.
“I thought he answered my question about whistleblowing well, but I wish he could give more solutions to how whistleblowers can handle issues internally and not just have to confide in the media,” Extension School student Andrew Kingsbury said.
Matte Hartog, a research fellow at the Kennedy School, echoed Kingsbury.
“Cybersecurity is one of the biggest challenges for the future,” Hartog said. “It’s a great opportunity for the students and people here. It’s great outreach for the government, and I hear [Rogers] is going around to other universities as well.”

UPDATED: October 6, 2016 at 3:50 p.m.
Responding to suggestions from the Faculty Council, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is hosting town hall sessions for professors, administrators, and the University’s labor representatives to discuss graduate student unionization.
In an email to the Faculty obtained by The Crimson, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote that the recent National Labor Relations Board decision granting undergraduate and graduate student teaching and research assistants the right to form a union “has raised many questions among the faculty.”
For faculty and administrators, there is ambiguity surrounding the unionization effort. Just as many undergraduates were unaware that they now have the right to form a union, Smith said he was unaware they were considering unionizing.
“This is news to me,” Smith said in an interview. “Up to this point I hadn’t heard that there were undergraduates organizing or thinking about unionizing.”
Smith’s email went on to state that “discussion sessions” would be held “at the suggestion of the Faculty Council.” The four sessions will be held in each FAS division—Arts and Humanities, Science, and Social Sciences—and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Three of these sessions have already occurred, while the Arts and Humanities event will be held Oct. 11.
Smith said faculty members “didn’t have enough understanding of the issues that are going on here, how they should be thinking about this, not from the point of view of me telling them what to think, but what information is out there that they can get access to.”
The idea for the discussions arose from a Faculty Council conversation, according to Japanese History professor David L. Howell, a member of the Council. Calling them “town halls,” Howell wrote in an email that the Council wanted to provide a space for faculty to ask questions and “generally get a better understanding of what [the NLRB decision] means for students, faculty, and the university.”
“I think it’s important for faculty to have access to as much information as possible. No single perspective—whether that of union organizers, the administration, or anyone else—should monopolize the discourse,” Howell wrote, speaking from his own perspective. “I see the town halls as part of a broader conversation.”
While representatives from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Office of Labor Relations, and the Office of the General Counsel were invited to attend, graduate student union spokesperson Jack M. Nicoludis said students were not invited or directly informed of the meetings.
“The administration has called for open conversations about graduate unionization but these meetings are only an opportunity to spread their messaging,” Nicoludis wrote in an email.
Nicoludis called the meetings an example of administrative interference and anti-union campaigning.
“We should be free to discuss unionization with our fellow graduate workers without pressure from our supervisors,” he wrote. “We want faculty to see that it is grad workers who decide whether we unionize, and that they should not take part of the administration’s anti-union campaign.”
FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven declined to comment on which administrators attended the town halls, although Smith said he did not attend the first two.
Nicoludis added that the union effort's neutrality pledge campaign geared toward faculty, circulated since last spring, has more than 100 faculty signatures. The pledge urges them to refrain from “public statements, one-on-one meetings, distribution of literature, or any other active campaigning or activities intended to affect the free choice of graduate workers” and to call on administrators to do the same. A different neutrality pledge that can be signed by anyone has "many hundreds" of signatures, he said.
Members of the union effort recently put together an FAQ document geared toward faculty on their website. One of the questions is, “Is Harvard’s administration really promoting an ‘open conversation’ about graduate unionization?”
“There will be plenty of other events I’m sure moving forward that can allow both sides to present their side of the argument,” Smith said.
“We need to make sure that we’re really hearing from everybody and not just a small percentage of graduate students,” he added, referring to union organizers.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly implied that the Graduate student unionization movement has circulated one neutrality pledge. In fact, it has circulated two, one of which is specifically geared towards faculty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED October 16, 2016, 12:44 a.m.
Winter is coming—but that does not mean the same thing for every room in Eliot House.
Opened in 1931, Eliot is heated by a steam-driven heat exchanger that transports hot water throughout the building when temperatures fall below 48 degrees. Aldis Elfarsdottir ’19, an Environmental Science and Engineering concentrator, noticed that this system gives students little control over the temperatures in their rooms and has begun to devise a way to mitigate the problem.
After Elfarsdottir noticed people across campus leaving their windows cracked open in the middle of winter last year, she began working with the Harvard Office for Sustainability to determine the amount of energy that was wasted and its environmental implications.
Elfasdottir worked with Christopher P. Bitzas, a Siemens energy engineer, and found that Eliot House lost 358 million British Thermal Units (BTU) of thermal energy last winter due to leaving windows open—more energy than the average American uses per year.
From there, Elfarsdottir attended a workshop at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to think of solutions, where she met Patrick K. Kuiper and Patrick B. Day, who received master’s degrees from SEAS in May.
Realizing the need for concrete data on temperature and humidity, the team installed Edison development boards in 15 dorm rooms in Eliot.
Rooms closer to the generator are often overheated, while those farther away can be drafty and cold, according to Elfarsdottir. The end result is an inadequate and inefficient heating system, which leaves Eliot with climate zones that range from tundra to temperate to tropical.
Elfarsdottir plans to develop an intricate map of Eliot’s rooms based on temperature with this data. She said she hopes that students will use this map in future years to select rooms based on their heating preferences, which in turn will lead to less energy waste.
“This is a good example of seeing the way that we interact with our environment and being conscious of the fact that our day to day actions have environmental implications” Elfarsdottir said.
Elfarsdottir, Kuiper, and Day found that the cost of the wasted energy has not only environmental implications but financial ones too. Closing all the windows in Eliot would save the House about $9,900 and the University $4,200 each year, according to the project’s final report.
“Some of the key benefits are one that it can really increase the occupant comfort of students in their rooms and it could also at the same time lower energy costs, and therefore greenhouse gas emissions as well,” Heather A. Henriksen, the Director of the Office for Sustainability, said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College’s Faculty Deans have a unique responsibility, setting a welcoming tone for students and staff in their residential Houses, while also serving as the chief administrators of their castles.
While the dual roles of community steward and bureaucratic manager rarely conflict, Wednesday’s strike of dining service workers has put Faculty Deans in an awkward position. Stuck between workers with whom they often have friendly relationships and their role as representatives of the College administration, Faculty Deans delicately walked the line in reassuring their students without alienating the workers they oversee.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, himself a Faculty Dean in Cabot House, sought to send a unifying message in an email to undergraduates Wednesday afternoon, encouraging students and dining hall workers to look out for one another.
“In this community – made up of students, administrative staff, faculty, residential staff, and our dining hall workers, how we treat each other in challenging times matters deeply,” Khurana wrote. “Caring for each other as individuals is ingrained in the very essence of Harvard’s culture.”
On Wednesday, Harvard’s dining hall workers took off their aprons and picked up loudspeakers to man picket lines during their first-ever strike during the academic year. Dining services workers left their posts Wednesday morning to protest ongoing contract negotiations with Harvard, after failing to reach a new contract despite a months-long negotiation process.
Multiple Faculty Deans echoed Khurana in expressing affinity and support for the striking workers, though they typically would be classified as on the side of management in a labor dispute.
“I think the first thing is that we really always support the HUDS workers,” Mather Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten said. But when Rosengarten was asked if he could pick a side, he replied, “I just don’t see it that way.”
“I’m really very supportive of the HUDS workers, but I’m primarily responsible for the welfare of the students,” he said.
Rosengarten was not alone in expressing strong ties and support for dining services workers.
“The fact that dining hall workers walk with students at Commencement attests to what they mean for the community,” Tom C. Conley, Kirkland’s Faculty Dean, said. “From my standpoint as a Faculty Dean who works for the community of the House, we have to take very strong cognizance of what the dining hall workers are working for and getting at.”
But with that support, however strong it may be, comes the awkward position of having to straddle two roles while serving diligently in the College’s bureaucracy.
Conley, for example, said he would “certainly not” join public demonstrations for the strikers, despite emphasizing the importance of supporting the dining hall workers. He said he prefers to “not to think along a binary line.”
At the same time as they are administrators, Faculty Deans serve as the figureheads and leaders of Harvard’s upperclassman House system, which the Office of Student Life website describes as “the foundation for the undergraduate experience at Harvard College.” On Wednesday, many Faculty deans emailed their respective Houses with information on the labor dispute and their own message about how to navigate the complexities of the strike.
In an email to students, Eliot Faculty Dean Gail A. O'Keefe wrote that students should not let their personal allegiances sway their opinion on the strike.
“A stance on the strike is not a position for or against Grace, Rosie or anyone,” O'Keefe wrote, referring to two Eliot dining workers. “[No] one should be making assumptions on loyalty to our community members, since not even all HUDS workers are of the same opinion on the strike.”
The Leverett Faculty Deans distributed information from the Student Labor Action Movement, a campus advocacy group helping organize student support for the strike, to Leverett residents in an email. More generally, many Houses—Adams, Kirkland, Currier, Mather, and Pforzheimer, to name a few—hosted meetings to discuss the strike and accompanying questions.
When asked how he was balancing the tension of his twin roles during the first day of the strike, Adams Faculty Dean John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said, “we’ve done it for 18 years now.”
“And if we support everybody, pretty much, then things go well and we maintain the sense of caring for the people who are in our community,” Palfrey added.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has made undergraduate social life a priority in its capital campaign fundraising, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said during a wide-ranging interview Wednesday, discussing his goals for the year.
FAS administrators are actively courting alumni donors to contribute to the College’s ongoing efforts to revamp social events on campus, Smith said, though he did not specify what those donations would fund. While Smith said FAS has helped fund undergraduate social life in the past, he hopes the school will allocate more money for new projects.
“We’ve got to find the cash” for undergraduate social life, Smith said, noting that FAS’s recently depleted cash reserves necessitate fundraising to contribute to the College’s efforts.
“We’re trying to craft the right kinds of fundraising priorities in that space that will encourage our alumni to consider giving,” Smith said, though he did not elaborate on the nature of such priorities.
The College has in recent years sought to increase its influence in undergraduate social life, from crafting new policies to funding parties on campus. And FAS is not the only funder outside of the College: University President Drew G. Faust has helped pay for the [BLANK] Party, organized by College women’s groups for the past two years.
Intensified scrutiny on the prevalence of sexual assault on campus has spurred much of the College’s efforts to shape social life. Partly in response to concerns over sexual assault, Harvard last spring unveiled a new College policy that will penalize future members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, such as final clubs and Greek organizations. Starting with the Class of 2021, the policy will bar members of those groups from holding leadership positions in recognized clubs and receiving prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes and the Marshall.
That policy has prompted widespread criticism. Last May, 12 professors submitted a motion in opposition to the policy, which the Faculty will discuss at their next full meeting in November. It is unclear, however, whether a vote approving the motion could override the policy.
Smith declined to offer his views on the policy, saying that he wanted the Faculty to share their opinions first.
“The Faculty can decide to discuss and point in a direction for policies, what they would like to do,” Smith said, referring to the motion. “Where we’re going to end up, I don’t know.”

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences may soon allow donors to endow Faculty Dean positions in the House of their choice, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in an interview on Wednesday.
Selling the naming rights could be a much-needed source of revenue for House renewal, Smith said. Fundraising for the renovations has fallen short, leading to a complete depletion of FAS's unrestricted reserves. Those reserves are down from $112 million in fiscal year 2013.
“I need cash now to run House renewal,” he said. “I’ve been asking as much as possible [of] our incredible alumni, if they can get cash in early to the project.”
Last February, Smith unveiled the “Faculty Dean” title after the former name of the position—“House Master”—sparked controversy for its perceived associated with slavery.
“There’s been wonderful reaction,” Smith said of the possibility of endowing the deanships. “This is a fantastic opportunity for [donors] to think about… giving back to the College and in an area that’s extremely important and had a huge effect on them.”
FAS surpassed its $2.5 billion fundraising goal in June. With construction on Winthrop House underway and Lowell House slated for a two-year renovation starting next year, Smith said he hopes to push fundraising for House renewal.
In addition to the renewed focus on struggling priorities, FAS has made fundraising for undergraduate social life a priority, Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many of Harvard’s employees and faculty will see an average 7 percent hike in their healthcare premium costs in 2017, but the University will at the same time offer slightly reduced premiums for its lowest-paid nonunion workers.
Citing “an increase in medical claims and prescription drug costs, especially specialty drugs,” Harvard announced Wednesday that premium costs will, on average, increase for the second year in a row; premiums jumped 7.3 percent last year. For some Harvard employees earning less than $55,000 per year, though, the premium cost will be mitigated by the creation of a new salary tier with lower premiums effective Jan. 1, 2017.
Harvard is extending the new tier to nonunion employees almost a year after a similar plan developed through prolonged, tense negotiations between Harvard’s largest union—the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—and the University.
Now, nonunion employees like postdoctoral students at Harvard will benefit from a healthcare payment structure similar to the one HUCTW negotiated. The HUCTW plan eliminates deductibles—the amount a person has to pay out of pocket before their insurance company will pay a claim—on the grounds that it would substantially raise copayments.
In recent years, healthcare benefits have been at the center of faculty and union protest. Harvard clashed with faculty in late 2014 over the restructuring of its insurance options effective January 2015. After the University introduced an out-of-pocket deductible and coinsurance to cut costs, nonunion faculty and staff pressured administrators into offering an additional plan without deductibles or coinsurance.
More recently, Harvard has faced backlash for its healthcare offerings from UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents Harvard University Dining Services employees. The union has repeatedly cited the health care plans Harvard has proposed to them as a major impetus for the historic strike they launched Wednesday morning.
Harvard’s currently-striking dining hall workers are still negotiating health benefits options with the University. When Harvard proposed a four-tiered plan identical to the one negotiated with HUCTW to the HUDS union Local 26, the union rejected the plan.
Harvard will also eliminate one health care plan option for nonunion employees and some union employees. Out of state employees will no longer be able to enroll in the Preferred Provider Organization program, which allows employees to “go to any health care professional [they] choose inside or outside [their] network.” Participants in this program will be automatically re-enrolled in Harvard Pilgrim Health Care plan of service unless otherwise requested.
While largely similar in scope to the 2016 plans, the 2017 insurance options will include an acupuncture benefit for all employees. Harvard will mail a guide to the plans to eligible employees next week and roll out an online comparative tool. The sign-up period for the new plans will run from Nov. 2 to 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 7. 2016, at 12:19 p.m.
Dillon J. Dunteman ’19 was fast asleep in Eliot House when he awoke at 5:45 a.m. to beating drums, blaring sirens, and chants of “No healthcare, no peace!” coming from JFK St. Harvard University Dining Services workers had gathered outside Eliot to picket as they launched the first day of their historic strike.
Protests began around 6 a.m. across campus, with strikers gathering outside upperclassman Houses to shout slogans, beat drums, and blare sirens. While some students joined the workers in the wee hours of the morning, many said they were not pleased by the early wake-up call. 
“I don’t get why they have to protest directly outside of the Houses,” Dunteman said. “You’re basically hurting the students who went out and endorsed you—the Undergraduate Council endorsed the strike—and you’re waking them up in the middle of midterms.”
He added he did support the strike, but that he thought it would have been better for protesters to have rallied at central locations on campus, rather than dorms, that early in the morning.
HUDS workers planned to picket at 16 different locations on campus throughout the day on Wednesday, including in front of dining halls and around Harvard Yard. The strike marks the first time dining workers have ever walked off the job during the academic year, and the first HUDS walkout Harvard has seen since 1983, according to Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based labor union that represents HUDS.
Margaret-Ann Simonetta, a student at the Extension School, also expressed irritation with the strike’s timing. She said she was studying in Lamont Library around 10 a.m. when protesters began circling outside, distracting students working in the building.
“I was trying to get through one of my take-home midterms, and it was just like blaring sounds, everybody was screaming,” she said. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for people’s protests, but when it gets in the way of my academics it kinda irks me a bit.”
With midterm season in full swing, students characterized the strike’s taking place in the middle of a stressful academic period as unwelcome. Emma M. Orcutt ’19 said the strike complicated the exam she was scheduled to take Wednesday, adding that walking through picket lines in the Yard en route to a midterm was “a really weird experience.”
When the exam began, Orcutt said, she could still hear people chanting outside the window. Though the situation was far from “ideal,” neither she nor fellow students could do anything about it, she said.
Other students said the strike had little impact on their daily activities, especially on their dining experience. The dining halls of Cabot, Dunster, and Kirkland Houses closed Wednesday morning for the duration of the strike. The remaining dining halls on campus remained open but operated with a skeleton staff of managers, re-assigned Harvard staff, and 15 temporary workers hired as last-minute replacements by the University.
While dining in Annenberg, the freshman dining hall, around 8 a.m. on Wednesday, Parker Lombardo ’20 and Sierra Moore ’20 both said they felt relatively unaffected by the strike and were supportive of HUDS workers’ position. Lombardo added that, if he had to eat “bagels and muffins” instead of “the elaborate lay of eggs and hashbrowns” HUDS usually provides, that was “fine with me.”
Still other students said the strike interrupted their normal Wednesday schedule, but laid the blame squarely on Harvard, not on HUDS workers. Samara K. Ford ’18 was awakened by workers’ protests around 5:45 a.m., and promptly decided to join the picket line at 6 a.m.
“[It] made me feel annoyed with Harvard administration for pushing the workers to the point of a strike,” Ford wrote in an email. “Sure, I did not plan this into my study time, but I believe being a Harvard student means a lot more than just how much time I spend doing homework.
“It’s about being a loyal member of this community and supporting those who make my daily routine possible in the first place,” she added.
Kennedy School professor Timothy P. McCarthy  ’93 and Arabic teaching fellow W. Sasson Chahanovich both said they altered their classes’ Wednesday curricula to include a discussion of the HUDS strike. Chahanovich, who teaches a second-level intermediate Arabic class, said he asked students questions about the strike to help them practice their Arabic vocabulary and to make them aware of what was going on.
McCarthy said he chose to bring up the strike in his class, Culture and Belief 49: “American Protest Literature from Tom Paine to Tupac,” both because it was relevant to the theme of the class and because he felt morally obligated to do so.
“I believe that as a faculty we have an opportunity to provide a moral education as well as an academic education,”  he said. “That’s the kind of education I got, [and] that’s the kind of education I want to pay forward to my students.”
He added that he also had a more personal motivation to foster student awareness and support of the strike. McCarthy has lived in Quincy for over 20 years—first as an undergraduate, then as a senior resident tutor, and now as a faculty affiliate. During this time, he said, he has gotten to know Quincy’s dining hall workers very well.
“There were people on the picket line today who also provided me with my own nourishment as an undergraduate,” he said. “I feel an additional drive to support people who supported me when I was just a kid.”

Harvard’s dining services workers gathered in force Wednesday morning at 16 different picketing locations across Harvard’s campus, marking the kickoff of a historic strike. Here’s a recap of Wednesday's picketing activities:

Roughly 600 workers brandished picket signs and rallied for maintaining their health benefits package and for and wage increases Wednesday, branching out across various picket lines to moderately disrupt campus dining services. Chanting “shut it down,” workers converged on the Science Center Plaza at 9 a.m. before streaming through Harvard Yard with workers and supporters.
Their strike began at 6 a.m.

At a charged rally on the Science Center Plaza, HUDS workers and leadership from the union that represents HUDS, UNITE HERE Local 26, blasted Harvard’s administration for being what they described as “greedy.” The union’s lead negotiator, Mike Kramer argued that administrators had “isolated” themselves by refusing to bend to the union’s demands.

Harvard will meet with Local 26’s bargaining unit Thursday afternoon at an undisclosed location in the hopes of reaching a contract settlement and stopping a strike that currently does not have an expected conclusion. According to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga, Thursday's session will also feature two outside mediators—Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economics professor, and Robert B. McKersie, professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, both of whom served as mediators during Harvard’s contract talks with its largest union last year.

With workers absent from the dining halls, HUDS managers took the reins and served food, cleaned up after students and helped maintain a semblance of normalcy as picketers chanted outside of the doors. Harvard supplemented that meager workforce—only 70 managers, as opposed to the hundreds of dining workers who typically staff the halls—with 15 temporary workers from an unnamed, outside contractor, and 15 “exempt” workers, according to deLuzuriaga.
“Harvard University Dining Services will continue to meet the needs of our students to the best of its ability for the duration of the strike,” she wrote in a  statement.
Other Houses saw Faculty Deans help swipe students into dining halls.

Though support for the HUDS workers among students is high, some students said the strike added to their stress with the start of midterm season. Hundreds of undergraduates, for example, had an exam in Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics”—the College’s most popular course.  Some students took to Harvard Square for lunch, causing a surge in customers at many eateries.

UPDATED: October 6, 2016, at 8:15 p.m.
Harvard’s dining services employees were joined by workers from Boston as they continued to rally support in their historic strike's second day on Thursday.
The earliest picket line on Wednesday sprung up around 5:30 a.m. in front of the Harvard Kennedy School on JFK Street. Throughout the rest of the early morning, picket lines were thin and subdued compared to the boisterous crowds who demonstrated on the first day of the strike, though by mid-morning Local 26 workers were once again out in force at locations across Harvard’s campuses—including in front of the Law School and in Longwood.
Protesters gathered in the Science Center Plaza around 1:30 p.m. for a brief reprieve from picketing. The Undergraduate Council allocated $200 on Thursday for providing workers at the rally with coffee and donuts, according to Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather '17. Picket lines were scheduled to resume at 2 p.m., with the bulk of the protesters headed to the Faculty Club.
Hotel workers and dining hall employees from other union outposts in Boston joined HUDS workers on the picket lines to supplement what was, on Wednesday, a 600-person strong crowd of protesters. Harvard’s dining service workers kicked off the first academic-year strike in their history Wednesday morning and staffed picket lines throughout the remainder of the day.
“Hey Harvard you can’t hide, we can see your greedy side!” picketers and supporters chanted as they marched around Annenberg dining hall around noon today.
The protesters numbered in the hundreds, gathering on the sidewalk in front of the dining hall and forcing many students to walk on the grass around them.
“[The strike] is going fantastic. I think we’ve sent a message to the University that this community is more important than their agenda,” said William Ridgley, a general cook in Winthrop House. “We will keep it up everyday until we win this healthcare fight.”
Support for HUDS workers continued to grow among students throughout the evening Wednesday and through the early morning on Thursday.
Anwar E. Omeish ’19—a member of the Student Labor Action Movement—said the organization had been supporting the strike in various ways of the past few days, including supplying food and organizing some events.
“I think it’s going well,” Omeish said. “Worker morale seems high, and we’re just hoping for a good outcome now. We’re going to be here as long as they are.”
Local 26 negotiator Mike Kramer said he and the union do not plan to back down in negotiations with the University. At a rally outside the Science Center, Kramer said: “We’re winning.”
At around 5 p.m., for what students called a “dine-in,” HUDS workers and student protesters marched several times around Harvard Yard and Mass. Ave., before congregating in the grass between outside Johnston Gate. As protesters marched, a few undergraduates lined their path, handing out food from Harvard dining halls to HUDS workers.
After the marching ceased, students, HUDS workers, and other protestors congregated in the grass for several student speeches and performances, including songs from undergraduate groups like the Veritones and Kuumba Singers, as well as a student beatboxing and breakdancing performance.
Scattered throughout the performances were several students’ testimonies about HUDS workers and their impact on student life. Noah R. Wagner ’18, for example, recalled several snowstorms in 2015 when workers slept on campus in order to avoid traveling in inclement weather. Though HUDS workers were invited to speak at the SLAM-organized event, none took the microphone.
Joining the protest were about 200 undergraduates, who ate dinner on blankets and metal chairs in the Yard.
The strike has continued to affect dining options on campus. Annenberg Hall was closed to upperclassmen in response to high demand, according to an email sent to Adams House residents by Taj Michael Smith, the House’s academic coordinator. Additionally, interhouse restrictions were mostly lifted except for at Eliot House, where only Kirkland residents will be allowed to eat because of their own dining hall’s closure.
Harvard and the union met for a bargaining session Thursday afternoon at an undisclosed location on the University’s campus in the hopes of halting the strike and coming to an agreement. While Thursday’s negotiation session did not yield a settlement on a new contract, the two parties have scheduled another session for Friday.
Economics professor Lawrence F. Katz and Robert B. McKersie, professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School of Management—both veterans of recent union negotiations involving Harvard—will join the bargaining session as outside mediators. HUDS has been in contract talks with Harvard for nearly four months—a process protracted by impassioned debate over the workers’ health care benefits and wages.
Tania deLuzuriaga, a University spokesperson, wrote on Wednesday that Harvard is “committed to working with Local 26 in good faith to reach a new agreement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hammerschlagen”—what does it mean?
Credible internet sources suggest a variety of answers. The word may mean “to beat with a hammer,” “hammer beating,” or “a game in which participants beat things with a hammer.” All valid.
As a football writer for The Harvard Crimson, however, I have special authority on the topic. “Hammerschlagen” has precisely one meaning, namely “the brutal, incessant, and pounding reality known as Ivy League football.”
Sometimes you’re a hammer, and sometimes you’re a nail. Simple as that.
After three weeks of play, Harvard football has yet to bend beneath the cruel metal of domination. The team is 3-0, but all the players are hungry. Literally they are hungry. Literally. All of them have limited access to food because HUDS went on strike, leaving behind mysterious items such as “Harvest Vegetable Pyramids.”
What can we students do, hunt squirrels in Harvard Square? I believe in workers’ rights, but squirrels are fast and devious creatures. It’s a tough situation. Everyone hoards protein like French citizens before the Revolution, and there are no hard-boiled eggs at breakfast.
Needless to say, I need activities such as this column to distract me from starvation. We have a DELICIOUS offering of games this weekend. Indeed the Ancient Eight in 2016 is as varied as sports writer Julio Fierro’s collection of Patagonia fleeces.
Before diving into details, however, I’m contractually obligated to assert my status as veteran football beat writer. Gant and Jack, I hope you enjoyed warming the Around the Ivies throne the last two weeks. Maybe you described the inadequacies of your dating life, and maybe you made wildly inaccurate predictions about Penn-Dartmouth. But really, who’s counting?
I’m counting, that’s who. And I expect my predictions this week to be as accurate as the nickname “Four-Beer Gant.” In other words, 100 percent accurate. Onto the hammerschlagen:
STETSON AT BROWN
The Waterboy (1998) tells the tale of a 31-year-old man named Bobby (Adam Sandler) who dreams of hydrating a local college team called the Mud Dogs. As Wikipedia details, players face many problems: “[T]hey have lost 40 consecutive games, their cheerleaders have become alcoholics, and players are forced to share equipment.” Tough times.
Many twists ensue—it turns out that Bobby’s assumed-dead father is living with a voodoo priestess, for example—but the movie ends happily. Bobby emerges as a bone-crushing linebacker, the Mud Dogs win the championship, and everyone is glad when the credits roll.
Parts of The Waterboy were filmed at Stetson University, and this cinematic fact may mark the University’s biggest claim to fame. Which tells you a lot about Stetson.
Let’s just say that it’d take the intervention of a voodoo priestess, rehabbed cheerleaders, and a Waterboy-style miracle for the Hatters to win.
Prediction: Brown 34, Stetson 14
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
Earlier this week, an enormous fire broke out at a Dartmouth dormitory. Frat prank gone wrong? Back-to-nature protest?
Neither one, it turned out. As local newspapers chronicled, “an unattended hibachi-style grill” caused the damage. For six hours the inferno raged, displacing 70 students. No word yet on the status of the steak.
It’s safe to say that wherever the Big Green goes, fire will follow. And on Saturday, Dartmouth will travel to Yale to inflict destruction on an 0-3 Bulldogs team.
Like an abandoned hibachi grill, New Haven, Conn. will be burning this weekend. As in, more than usual. And at the end of the day, the city will resemble a pile of ashes. Once again—as in, more than usual.
Prediction: Dartmouth 31, Yale 10
CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE AT PENN
Surely it’s demoralizing to play for the second-best Blue Devils program in college football.
Do you realize how specific that mascot is? Not just “the Devils”—which, when you think about, is a weird object of affection—but “the Blue Devils.” Loony.
Here, then, is my first prediction: A fight will break out when Central Connecticut plays Penn. Inferiority complexes die hard. It also helps that the Quakers sport an overpowered offense and a veteran defense.
Penn may put up bigger numbers than former sports writer David Freed’s story count. Or we can express the probability of this game through simple geography. An entire state trumps a partial one. Every. Single. Time.
Prediction: Penn 49, Central Connecticut State 10
CORNELL AT HARVARD
Don’t look now, but exciting times have come to Cornell. The University’s endowment made Bloomberg headlines, a 12-year-old student recently enrolled, and the football team has enough joy to tweet out a photo of “THE BIG SOMBRERO.”
On second take, however, all these sweet facts turn a little sour. Cornell’s endowment made the news because it lost 3.3 percent—worse even than Harvard. Sure, 12-year-old Jeremy started school, but he leaves every day when his parents pick him up. And “THE BIG SOMBRERO”? That one fell through when campus Latino groups took offense to it. As one student said, “A decent portion of Cornelians kind of don’t have sympathy for one another.” Hmmm.
The Big Red enters this weekend with a 3-0 record, fresh off a dramatic upset over No. 25 Colgate. No Ithaca team under coach David Archer has experienced such early success.
Even so, the crucial fact remains that Cornell football typically loses to Harvard football. Per usual it’ll be a long ride back to Ithaca.
Prediction: Harvard 24, Cornell 20
COLUMBIA AT WAGNER
First fact: Wagner College has graduated more Miss New Jerseys (three) than NFL players (two).
Second fact: When you search “Miss America arrested” on Google, the first three distinct results detail how: a former Miss Pennsylvania faked cancer; a former Miss America shoplifted nail polish and flashlight batteries, among other items; and a former Miss Kansas illegally killed a grizzly bear.
Synthesis of facts: Wagner contains beauty. But beauty can be dangerous.
It’s tempting to look at the Seahawks’ ranking just outside the FCS top 25 and predict a blowout victory. Lest we forget, Columbia is Columbia, meaning 0-3.
However, the Lions have grown from dysfunctional baby cubs into semi-functional preteens. We’re about 10 minutes into The Lion King.
Wagner will win, make no doubt, but the going will be tough. Slowly the Lions from Morningside Heights are climbing the rock.
Prediction: Wagner 17, Columbia 10
PRINCETON AT GEORGETOWN
RIP to the lost dogs. That headline accurately describes the scene at Texas A&M last year, when the Aggies re-interred seven canines who had served as mascots. Now fans can pay their respects before watching SEC football.
RIP to the lost dogs also foreshadows the outcome of this week’s Princeton-Georgetown mascot. Last Saturday the Tigers steamrolled over Columbia, rebounding from a high-scoring loss to Lehigh.
The Hoyas, meanwhile, were undefeated before a 31-17 defeat to the Harvard that sounded closer than it actually was. Besides two long scores, Georgetown totaled 116 yards and generally inspired pity.
Let me tell a final story to illustrate my point. Early this year, Harvard water polo coach Ted Minnis traveled to New Jersey for the Princeton Invitational. He rose to the occasion, flashing great ability throughout the weekend. The Crimson played three games and won all three - a truly happy ending.
Magical things happen at Princeton. That magic will stay with the Tigers when they trek to the nation’s capital.
Prediction: Princeton 34, Georgetown 13

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team is on a roll at the moment, having outscored its opponents 11-3 over the stretch of its current five-game winning streak.
Determination, energy, and a will to keep chipping away have been the ingredients to its late success.
“We believe in ourselves,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “We’re capable of coming back from being a goal down, or taking our opportunities, and making sure that we’re focused on the moment and not looking back or looking forward.”
The Crimson (7-3, 2-0 Ivy League) will look to build on what’s made them so successful this year as it prepares for a home match against visiting Cornell (3-6-1, 0-2) on Saturday afternoon.
The Big Red is coming off a 5-0 drubbing at the hands of Penn, while Harvard rolls into its next game off the heels of a 2-1 comeback victory over Yale that energized the entire team.
“I was so impressed by the energy that we displayed against Yale,” Hamblin said. “Our focus has been on improving each game, and we think we’ve been doing that right now.”
The energy was visible in the way the Harvard bench exploded after both senior forward Midge Purce’s game-tyer and junior midfielder Caroline Chagares’ game-winner against Yale.
The team’s momentum has been steadily growing, complementing the drive to win that has been evident from early in the year.
“One thing that has honestly impressed me is the maturity on the field all of our team, from the freshman up to the seniors,” senior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack said. “I feel a bit of a drive in this year’s group that maybe wasn’t as strong last year.”
Playing against Cornell will require the same amount of everything—nothing in the recipe has changed.
“Our game plan is the same as we’ve been doing all year, which is just focusing on ourselves, making sure we are executing to the best of our ability, and improving incrementally,” Hamblin said. “We do try to understand where [Cornell’s] strengths and weaknesses are, and see how we can fit our game plan into that, but we really look at ‘us’ as the primary focus of what we’re trying to achieve.”
While the Crimson is focusing on maintaining on its own drive and focus, the Big Red comes into the matchup with a mightily struggling offense and an 0-2 record within the conference. Cornell has been outscored 7-0 by Columbia and Penn, combined, and has only found the back of the net once over the course of its last seven games overall.
“Cornell’s in a tough spot, having lost the first two, but everyone’s still alive,” Hamblin said. “We’re expecting Cornell’s best, and we know they’re a good team…they’re a team that’s going to be well-coached, well-prepared.”
Harvard boasts star power up front with Purce on pace for a personal-best season, as she now has 20 points on nine goals and two assists over 10 games.
With six games left on the Crimson’s schedule, Purce is well on her way to surpassing her marks of 11 goals in a season, set during her freshman and sophomore campaigns.
Durack, Harvard’s primary goalkeeper, has also anchored the team well during her 540 minutes of action on the season. She has two shutouts to her name, on top of a 5-2 goalie record, a 77% save percentage, and a 1.17 goals-against average.
On the other side of the field, senior goalkeeper Kelsey Tierney has seen a drop-off from last year’s historic season with the Big Red, possessing just a 67% save percentage and a 1.65 GAA this year. Tierney recorded 12 shutouts, posted a 0.50 GAA—good for top ten among goalies across the nation—and received All-Ivy First Team honors last year.
Cornell junior forward Paige DeLoach anchors the offensive end with four points on two goals on the season.
The Crimson will look to take care of business by defending its home turf against a struggling team, but still aren’t taking Saturday’s opponent lightly.
