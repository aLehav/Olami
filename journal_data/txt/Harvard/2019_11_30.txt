After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been less than two years since “The Cruel Prince,” Holly Black’s first novel in the Folk of the Air trilogy, was published. This past week, the final book in the Faerie-centered series, “The Queen of Nothing,” hit shelves. The trilogy follows a human girl, Jude, who is raised in the Faerie world, by the fairy who killed her parents, as she tries to navigate court politics and everyday life. The series is well known for its heated hate-to-love romance between Jude and Cardan, a fairy prince known for his cruelty. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Black about her writing process, Jude and Cardan, and what’s next for the author.
The Harvard Crimson: How does it feel to be saying goodbye to these characters? Are you ready at this point, or is it a tough goodbye? Or not a goodbye at all?
Holly Black: I mean, I’ve been writing in Faerie a long time, my first book was set in Faerie, and those characters in that first book have shown up in the Folk of the Air series. And so, yeah, I’m okay with saying goodbye. I feel good about it because it means a conclusion. And it’s a long time to wait for an end to something. I’m glad it has an end, but I don’t feel like I can’t visit them.
THC: This is not your first foray into the Faerie world. What draws you to this particular type of fantasy?
HB: I mean, there’s a couple of things that I love about Faerie. It’s not one kind of creature, but an entire ecosystem. You have your pixies and sprites and trolls and goblins, your trooping fairies, and solitary fairies. And I think it’s interesting that unlike some other supernatural creatures, like for instance, a vampire, which is a human that has died and come back, or the werewolf, who is human some of the time, fairies are not human and have never been human. I think there’s something that’s really interesting about their otherness and their different sense of morality. I’m specifically drawn to the idea of fairy fruit á la Goblin market. The idea that there is something about Faerie that is just so beautiful, but it’s a kind of a ruinous beauty. But you know, once you taste fairy food, all other food is like ashes in your mouth. And yet, you still want to take a bite. That tension to me is very interesting.
THC: How much do you research into myths? What’s your worldbuilding process like?
HB: Well, a lot of what I wrote is from folklore. I think it’s one of the great advantages of operating in a tradition that gives you all of this material to work with and draw on. And also, I think when you’re working with folklore, you’re already working with something that has resonance with people. There’s a reason that these stories are told over and over and over again. And yet, there comes a point in which you may want to do things. I think specifically with this series where I wanted to do things that I didn’t have a lot of models from, you know, when you talk about going into Faerie and really understanding the rules and understanding what’s happening with the monarchy, there isn’t a lot of folklore dealing with that. So I had to make some decisions about how I wanted to conceptualize that world and what seemed resonant to me and what seemed like it would not contradict what I knew.
THC: If you were one of the Folk, what would you be?
HB: I would love to have a tail. It seems great. I like to swim; I wouldn’t mind being a kelpie. I guess eating people is a mixed bag. I like that you can turn into a person some of the time. You can ride around and also swim. I’m pro that. I don’t think that I have the political bent to be one of the courtly trooping fairies. I fear that I would be a solitary hag, putting curses on people. I do love a bargain. I enjoy making ill-advised fairy bargains for my mortals.
THC: Fairies are tricky with their words, but they’re not able to lie. How difficult was it to write a story that hinges on politics and rumors, bargains and discussions?
HB: I think the most difficult thing to root out is the writing of the polite lie. It’s really hard for people not to be like, “I’m fine.” They’re not fine! It’s such an automatic part of being human that I find that most difficult to remember that [the fairies] can’t do. I think it’s actually useful in a lot of ways to have a constraint on lying when it comes to politics because there’s games the reader can play that I think are useful in terms of the fact that the reader knows they’re not being lied to, so they know it’s a puzzle that they can figure out. It’s the polite lie that really gets me.
THC: What’s the draw of love-hate romance in literature?
HB: There’s a sense in which, the thing I wanted to capture in the first book is that there’s a sense of real shock and real surprise which I think is really pleasurable. I think that it it feels very high stakes. I think that you really try to figure out what is going on with this other person in a way that is fun to do. I think that it feels high stakes in a way that often emotionally we feel in not hate-to-love romance but in our real lives. A real high stakes that I think translates well to the feeling that we have. Certainly not the actual situation but I think that there is a metaphorical continuum in which it feels true.
THC: Who’s your favorite character in the series, and are they the same as your favorite character to write?
HB: My favorite character is Jude. She’s the person I first had the initial idea for this series, this girl who is kind of a reverse changeling whose parents are murdered by this guy who brings her and her sisters into Faerie. She’s used to living with a lot of fear, because no matter how caring he is, he’s still always the person who killed her parents. So she is, in this place where she turns out to be very, very good in high stakes settings and maybe not so good at being okay. To me, that is the essential thing that she and Cardan have in common, that they have never met anybody else who has in common, that they are used to operating in this extremely scary world. They’re used to being scared all the time in their scary world. And everyone else who is functioning in that world doesn’t seem to feel like they’re in that place with extreme pressure in it. So yeah, she is absolutely my favorite, but my favorite to write is probably Madoc because I love bad old guy advice.
THC: So your fans are about to get a conclusion to this series. Are there any other books about the fairy world that you’d recommend for readers?
HB: [Melissa Albert’s] “The Hazel Wood,” it’s not entirely about fairies but has resonances in it. “The Night Country” [the sequel to “Hazelwood”] is coming out and I’m really excited about it. Naomi Novik’s “Spinning Silver” is absolutely incredible, like I can’t say enough about it.
THC: Do you have a new project percolating in your head or are you taking a break while on tour?
HB: One thing I really want to do, I’ve been trying for a long time to write an adult book, and I’m trying to work out the details of a magic system that is not based in any folklore. So I’m trying to figure out the details and how I want it all to work. Right now I feel like I’m writing backwards because I’m deleting more than I’m actually writing. But it’s fun. Sometimes I’m not even totally sure it’s fun, I think it will be fun if I like anything that I do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Nov. 29, 2019 at 4:26 p.m.
The Cambridge Fire Department responded to a two-alarm fire in Emerson Hall in Harvard Yard Friday afternoon.
The fire originated in a chimney-like shaft in the building where an exhaust pipe runs from a basement generator through a vent in the ceiling, Acting Fire Chief Gerard E. Mahoney said in an interview. Construction workers performing a generator test reported just before noon that they smelled smoke in the building, and as of roughly 1:45 p.m., firefighters believed the fire to be under control.
Mahoney said that the building was unoccupied other than the construction workers and that there were no injuries.
Tourists, reporters, and other onlookers gathered in and around Harvard Yard Friday afternoon as firefighters scaled the roof of Emerson — which houses the Philosophy department — where smoke was funnelling out of a vent.
Firefighters had difficulty accessing the fire because of masonry surrounding the pipe chase. Using axes and power saws, crews made several holes in the roof to ventilate and let in water, Mahoney said. He said the damage from the fire was not extensive.
“I mean, there’s some damage — we had to breach a couple of walls up on the top floor to access this, like, chimney area, and of course there’s always any time you have a fire there’s water damage — but I don’t think there’s too much on the lines of actual fire damage or smoke damage,” Mahoney said.
He compared the situation to a related incident that happened in the adjacent Sever Hall in August, adding that he plans to speak with the engineers and construction workers on the project about certain steps they should take to prevent similar fires from happening again.
“They’re related in the sense that the nature of what was going on is very similar. So we’re a little concerned about how this happens again,” Mahoney said.
As of 3 p.m, the fire had been extinguished, though a fire watch would remain at the scene through the evening, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
“Due to the holiday break, there were no classes or other activities taking place in the building at the time of the fire, and with that no injuries to faculty, staff or students. Harvard appreciates the quick response and efforts of CFD crews to address and extinguish the fire,” Swain wrote.
The University will assess the damage to determine if students and faculty will be able to access the building when classes resume Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 responded to a pair of letters sent by the Massachusetts Congressional delegation and alumni from the Class of 1969 supporting Harvard’s graduate student union in its contract negotiations with the University.
With less than a week until Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ Dec. 3 strike deadline, Bacow and Garber’s responses addressed differing proposals between Harvard and the union on key issues regarding grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints, compensation, and health benefits.
All 11 members of Massachusetts’ Democratic congressional delegation sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow Nov. 21 encouraging the University to “ensure fair treatment and strong workplace protections” for student workers.
“We believe this strike would be detrimental to students, workers, and community members and we therefore urge you to engage in good faith effort to reach a fair agreement before the strike deadline,” they wrote.
In his response to each senator and representative Wednesday, Bacow identified a number of “core issues” that remain outstanding in the negotiations. Among these areas, Bacow wrote that collective bargaining over “financial aid, grades, and assessment of academic achievement” are “unacceptable’ because he characterized them as academic issues.
Garber also acknowledged that there remain significant differences over “fundamental issues” that the University will not negotiate on in his email response to a Nov. 17 letter from 45 members of the Class of 1969.
Among these issues are the financial aid component currently in graduate student workers’ compensation distributed as stipends. The University’s proposal would bar the union from negotiating over the terms of graduate student workers’ stipends. HGSU, however, proposed compensation proposals that included provisions regarding the stipend.
In his letter to legislators, Bacow wrote that the University is guided by three “core principles.”
“We must protect the integrity of our teaching mission; we must protect the academic freedom that undergirds our research mission; and we must serve all of our students in each of Harvard's schools and academic programs, regardless of union membership,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow also discussed a divide over grievance procedures for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints – a key issue in the negotiation, writing that the union’s proposal would be inconsistent with federal Title IX regulations and covers only part of Harvard’s student body.
HGSU’s proposal would establish an alternative grievance procedure through which members of the union could choose to file complaints regarding sexual harassment and discrimination. That process could eventually lead to a third-party arbitration outside of the University’s internal Title IX procedures.
Forty-five members of the Class of 1969 also sent Bacow a letter on Nov. 17, urging him to improve pay and job security for graduate students and non-tenure-track faculty. According to the alumni’s analysis, 65 percent of teachers — including graduate students — are not tenured or on the tenure track.
Paula J. Caplan ’69 — a research psychologist who previously taught at Harvard — said in an interview that the lack of job security she faced as a lecturer and teaching assistant at Harvard motivated her to co-write the letter with Barbara C. Foley ’69.
“If I hadn't had some financial security to fall back on, that would have been utterly devastating,” Caplan said. “So my heart just goes out to the people who are in that position.”
The letter notes that the alumni have “taken note, with alarm” that the University expects faculty to pick up the work of striking graduate students.
“Harvard has essentially ordered the members of its tenured and tenure-track faculty to scab on their less advantaged colleagues,” the alumni wrote.
In his response, Garber wrote that while faculty members have the rights to support HGSU’s strike, they need to ensure that students will be able to complete their academic work.
“With that in mind, several weeks ago, across the University, we began contingency planning for a potential strike and our faculty and staff must be a part of fulfilling that responsibility,” Garber wrote.
Garber also wrote that he appreciated the alumni’s perspective on non-tenure-track faculty, and noted that the University includes these teaching staff in its faculty climate survey.
“This is one key input in our overall efforts to understand the needs of these teaching staff across Harvard,” Garber wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ORLANDO, FL. — The Crimson flirted with a program-defining upset, but the No. 5 Terps and its forceful supporters shifted the tide on its side heading into halftime and carried that momentum to a 80-73 win Friday afternoon.
Harvard jumped to as much as an 11-point lead heading into the final five minutes of the first half — including a 9-0 start to the contest — but saw that margin gradually diminish heading into intermission. Still-undefeated Maryland (7-0) took its first lead within three minutes of the second frame, and although the Aiken-led Crimson continued to fight tooth-and-nail, it could not withstand a 10-point spurt from Terps lead scorer Anthony Cowan that pulled the game away for Maryland.
Clearly outsized, the Crimson were outrebounded by its opponents 44-29, including allowing 15 offensive boards. Outside of Aiken’s 30 points, the Crimson did see double-digit performances from both senior forward Chris Lewis and sophomore guard Noah Kirkwood but allowed five Terps to do the same. Maryland guards Aaron Wiggins, Darryl Morsell, and Eric Ayala combined for 39 points to complement Cowan’s 20 and imposing big man Jalen Smith’s 15.
“[Maryland] is incredibly long and athletic on the backboard, and I thought that was the biggest key and difference in the game,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “We knew that coming in, easier said than done in trying to talk about making that an area where we wouldn’t get beaten by...It was too much for us to defend but I was proud of our guys for their effort.”
After a quiet performance in the Crimson’s victory over Texas A&M on Thanksgiving, Aiken showed increased confidence in his shot and delivered a bevy of stepback jumpers, long-distance triples, and finishes near the rim in a 10-of-18 game. Harvard (5-3) also depended heavily on Lewis’ interior offensive finesse, but the 6-10 Smith hampered numerous opportunities at attacking the basket for the big men and other Crimson players.
“Bryce can score with the best of them, no doubt about it,” Amaker said. “He had a pretty efficient offensive game here but he can be better than that, especially in certain areas in quarterbacking our team and leading our team. Those are areas we need him to embrace a little bit more, but certainly his scoring production is always something that we rely on.”
Maryland brought out a considerable supporting section, making the game feel closer to being in College Park than in “neutral” Orlando. The Crimson last played in such a vociferous environment in the NIT Second Round on the road against NC State, but such an atmosphere did not significantly faze the well-tested team, according to senior Justin Bassey.
“We are a veteran team and have a lot of older guys,” Bassey said. “There is nothing that we haven’t been through before so it’s nice for the younger guys to get some of the Ivy League experience, tournament-play experience under their belt. But nothing unexpected for a lot of our older guys.”
Terps coach Mark Turgeon praised the Crimson’s performance today, but stated that his team’s languish start was due to a lack of energy.
“I think Harvard will win 20+ games this year and have a chance to be an NCAA Tournament team,” Turgeon stated. “I thought yesterday we have energy, today we had nothing. We’re a rah-rah team in the dressing room, a rah-rah team when we’re stretching.”
In that early spurts, the Crimson held Turgeon’s side scoreless until the 15:40 mark, and forced 10 Maryland turnovers within the initial ten minutes. Harvard showed a mix of interior forcefulness through Lewis and benefited from triples by senior Rob Baker and Aiken, while frustrating the Terps to an early 3-of-11 shooting night on the field.
But Maryland began to narrow the margin back to one possession as Turgeon began to push his players to attack the paint more aggressively. In the final four minutes before halftime, the lone offensive contribution from the Crimson was two Aiken free throws in the final four minutes before a late drive-in layup from the guard and two last-second Bassey free throws salvaged a four-point lead heading into halftime. The momentum, however, still was very much on the side of the Terps.
Harvard succumbed to a Maryland run to start the second frame, relinquishing its lead. But a wide-open Kirkwood triple and two Lewis hook shots returned the halftime margin back to four and another deep Aiken extended the margin to seven at the 14:15 mark. With lead scorer Anthony Cowan on the bench due to foul trouble, the Crimson appeared prime for an extended run.
But the Terps held their ground, holding the margin to no more than two possessions. Despite strong finishes at the baskett from Ledlum and Haskett, the Crimson saw its margin evaporate as Cowan began to catch fire. Knocking down 10 points in a two-minute span, Cowan brought the Terps back on top at the 9:26 mark.
Heading down to the last five minutes of action, however, Maryland began to pick up steam with Lewis on the bench in foul trouble, sprinting out to a 7-1 run and extending its lead to six, its largest of the game. Another Wiggins three from the corner brought the margin to seven, and the Crimson could not bring it any closer than six to conclude the contest.
“The key word for me, and I think all good teams have this is balance,” said Amaker on the Terps talented side. “I think they have a lot of pieces to the puzzle.”
“Their team across the board, wings and bigs, showed incredible effort on the board,” Bassey added. “That’s probably something we could have done a better job of.”
Harvard now has one more game in the Orlando Invitational on Sunday, facing the loser of Marquette and USC for the third place game. The game will be at Sunday at 6pm and televised nationally on ESPN2. Tested by another top-tier program, the Crimson will have one more chance at making a statement on a national stage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through the first four weeks of the season, the No. 9/6 Harvard men’s hockey team skated to its best ever start, rattling off six straight victories. In Friday night’s home tilt against No. 14/12 Boston College, the Crimson was well-positioned to extend its unblemished record — but a two-minute span late in the second period changed everything.
The Eagles (9-4-0, 5-2-0 HEA) handed Harvard (6-1-0, 6-0-0 ECAC) its first loss of the campaign, by a score of 4-2, thanks to a three-score rally in the middle stanza.
“The game’s got to come down to that minute and 50 seconds where we got the three goals in the second period,” BC coach Jerry York said. “We’re down, 2-0, and we just kind of caught fire…. Our penalty killing, the two-minute span in the second, that was a pretty thorough game by us. I thought in all three zones, we played very solid.”
With under three minutes to go in the second, Harvard sophomore Jack Drury punched home a powerplay goal, receiving a pass in close from classmate and blue-liner Jack Rathbone before opening up to the net-mouth and roofing the puck. The Crimson appeared to be heading into the intermission with a 2-0 advantage, threatening the Eagles’ own six-game winning streak.
BC had other plans, however, and immediately got to work trimming the deficit. Mere seconds after Drury’s tally, junior forward Jack Badini, scorer of Harvard’s first-period goal, headed to the box for a tripping infraction. On the ensuing faceoff in the Crimson’s zone, Eagles forward Logan Hutsko fired a hard pass to the slot, where fellow junior Aapeli Räsänen redirected it past Harvard goaltender Cameron Gornet.
The primary assist extended Hutsko’s point streak to nine, while Räsänen notched his fifth multi-point outing of the season. The scoring play also sparked a comeback rally for BC, which concluded before the period horn.
On a seemingly contained transition play, Eagles rookie forward Mike Hardman threw a puck toward the goal from a sharp angle. Gornet attempted to snuff out the danger but instead directed a rebound into the slot with his stick. Freshman Alex Newhook was there for the visitors to bury the chance, evening the ledger at 2-2.
“They’re a good hockey team,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We knew they were going to make a little bit of a run. We have to be able to manage that situation and kind of get the ship back in the right direction.”
After mustering a meager three shots on goal in the first frame, BC’s offense was roaring. Two shifts after Newhook’s tuck came the Eagles’ third strike in two minutes. A cross-ice dump-in allowed BC to change lines while senior Graham McPhee fetched the puck in the right corner. McPhee found forward Julius Mattila, fresh off the change, with a centering pass. Mattila slipped the puck across the slot to David Cotton, whose quick forehand-backhand deke beat Gornet. And just like that, the Eagles had stolen the lead, and the game, from the Crimson.
“They had one guy in the zone,” coach Donato began. “We were hesitant to go play him, and instead of outnumbering him and taking the puck out of his hands…we end up playing defense, and they make a great play coming off the bench. We’re all watching the puck and not watching the guys coming off the bench.”
Harvard had multiple opportunities to knot the score in the third period. BC took three penalties in the final 20 minutes, gifting prime chances to equalize to a Crimson powerplay with formidable weapons. But the hosts failed to find twine.
Cotton, after seizing the lead for his group in the waning seconds of the second period, was whistled for a slash just 20 seconds after the opening faceoff of the third. While Harvard loomed on the ensuing man advantage, it did not make the Eagles pay for their captain’s infraction.
The Crimson’s next man-up chance came in the middle of the frame, but it proved to be catastrophic. Not only did Harvard come up empty on the powerplay, but BC countered with a shorthanded goal courtesy of sophomore Marc McLaughlin, boosting both its lead and its morale. The man-down tally stretched the score to 4-2, where it finished.
“They end up with a powerplay goal and a shorthanded goal,” coach Donato said. “The goaltender made four or five saves at important times, and that’s the difference in the game.”
For most of the contest prior to the Eagles’ key second-period rally, the Crimson was able to contain the BC offense. Gornet (4 GA, .857 SV%) was scarcely tested early and made multiple crucial saves, yet he suffered his first loss of the season. Staring down the ice at Gornet was freshman net-minder Spencer Knight (2 GA, .931 SV%), a first-round draft pick of the National Hockey League’s Florida Panthers organization.
“I thought Spencer made some terrific saves,” coach York said. “Point-blank shots, he just came up big. He plays angles really, really well. He’s a special goaltender.”
On Friday evening, the highly touted backstop added to his impressive campaign, ranking just outside the national top 10 in both goals against average (1.92) and save percentage (.934) for the year. Coach Donato’s group will be wary of Knight’s stout play between the pipes and the Eagles’ quick-strike ability, should the teams meet again in the second week of February’s Beanpot Tournament.
“This is a terrific series over the years,” coach York said. “Having played in it myself and then coached, the BC-Harvard matchup to me is kind of electric. I thought the crowd responded tonight…to see two good teams play. We both play the right way: we’re quick, we make plays.”
Harvard will have little time to dwell on its first loss of the 2019-2020 slate, as it clashes with another Beantown rival in Boston University on Tuesday. The stretch of high-profile matchups continues three days later, as historic rival No. 2 Cornell visits the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. A top-10 team heading into Friday’s loss to BC, the Crimson now faces a critical opportunity to validate its place among the NCAA’s top programs.
“When you play against good teams, there are more momentum shifts,” coach Donato said. “I thought it was a good crowd today. We hope to be in those types of situations where we’re playing against good teams with a lot at stake and good crowds. We’re a young team, and I thought [BC] pushed us in some areas that we needed to be pushed to get better.”
