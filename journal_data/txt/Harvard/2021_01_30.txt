After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Do you remember the Harlem Cultural Festival that summer of 1969?,” asks self-proclaimed “Harlem Ambassador” Musa Jackson from a dark, empty room.
The festival in question was a series of concerts held in Harlem, New York City, during the summer of 1969 — a jubilant testament to Black music, culture, and pride. Attendance stood at a staggering 300,000 people, and the festival took place only 100 miles south of the now-iconic Woodstock Festival in upstate New York. As is true for Woodstock, the entire Harlem Cultural Festival was immortalized on video, but filmmaker Hal Tunchin's historic footage went unreleased for over 50 years.
“Summer of Soul (...Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised),” the directorial debut of Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, is a documentary that tells the untold story of that festival, featuring never-before-seen performances from some of the most iconic artists of the ‘60s, including Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Sly & The Family Stone, and The 5th Dimension.
The film, which had its world premiere as the opening feature of the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, is itself a revolution. Thompson’s directorial vision is ever present in his treatment of the festival and its historical context, as he partakes in reclaiming a history once willingly left forgotten.
As Tulchin himself says in the film, “Woodstock was the same year, and Woodstock got all the publicity ... nobody cared about Harlem.”
And yet, “Summer of Soul” is not only a collaboration between Thompson and Tulchin, but also between the cultural movements of the '60s and present day. Thompson draws undeniable parallels between today’s Black Lives Matter Movement and the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. As Thompson said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, “the circumstances that caused the concert to happen back in 1969 were starting to happen in 2020.”
It's fair to say that Thompson brings about a sense of transformation for the concert film genre. He engages with the original footage not as a typical concert film, but as an entire essay dedicated to the Harlem Cultural Festival and its roots in a critical time for Black America. “Summer of Soul” expertly juxtaposes the joyous energy of the sunlit festival with scenes depicting the traumatic realities its performers and attendees were subject to in a country built on systemic racism. In doing so, Thompson calls upon the fact that music doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It never has.
In one of the film’s opening scenes, for example, a fierce drum solo by 19-year-old Stevie Wonder and colorful scenes of the festival’s massive crowds are interlaced with found footage of the Black Panthers, civil rights activists, and other freedom fighters to create a powerful montage. As one festival attendee says, “music was changing and revolution was coming together.”
It's remarkable that in a city filled with towering skyscrapers, the filmmakers never lose sight of the central community in Harlem. Most of Tulchin’s shots focus almost exclusively on the crowds of Black people and the musicians playing to them, never lifting their frame to include what was beyond the trees encircling the Harlem Cultural Festival. The footage (shot entirely in bright natural light due to the virtually nonexistent budget) depicts the festival as idyllic and euphoric.
In the film, there is a sense that Thompson is reclaiming a piece of indelible cultural history. By including attendees for whom the Harlem Cultural Festival was a life-altering moment, Thompson gives the story back to those who built and forwarded it: the Black community and the neighborhood in Harlem. One can see this with the quality of the original concert footage — which was damaged in places, colored with an orange haze or pink streaks. But the surface damage only adds to the film’s originality — an authentic commitment to a cultural history being reclaimed and retold.
A musician himself, Thompson gives new life and meaning to the songs and genres showcased that summer in Harlem, which included everything from jazz to gospel to motown and blues. Each performance is carefully coordinated to shed light on one of the many sociocultural issues the film engages with — whether it was contextualizing Nina Simone’s flaming performance of “To Be Young, Black, and Gifted” as a way to bring up segregation in schools or South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela’s performance of “Grazing in the Grass” as a way to call attention to the pervasive and “common struggle” of anti-Black racism across the globe — and the result is captivating.
Out of one revolution, Thompson crafts another — weaving stories, cultural phenomena, political movements, iconic performances, and intimate footage from a summer spent celebrating Blackness into a must-see film and stunning directorial debut.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ask anyone if they’re a Gryffindor or Slytherin, Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, and odds are they’ll know exactly what you mean and already have an answer. Clearly, few stories have meant so much to so many as “Harry Potter.”
And now, the Wizarding World is coming to the small screen. The Hollywood Reporter recently reported that a live-action series is in the works for HBO Max. The project is apparently in very early development — it hasn’t yet been confirmed by Warner Bros. or HBO Max — so there’s no information on what direction the show might take. Is it a remake of the original movies? Could it be a sequel that follows Harry, Ron, and Hermione after they defeat Voldemort? Or maybe a distant prequel, showing the origins of Hogwarts itself? The possibilities are endless, and it’s exciting to speculate.
With this news, “Harry Potter” has become the latest franchise to embrace the structure of the cinematic universe: a large body of interconnected on-screen stories. The most notable cinematic universe to date is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). 22 movies after “Iron Man” (2008), the MCU is still going strong and shows no signs of stopping, with 11 movies and 11 TV shows coming to cinemas and streaming services soon. “Star Wars” has also become a sort of cinematic universe — in addition to the nine movies of the Skywalker Saga, there have been three spin-off films and four series. At Disney’s recent Investor Day, 11 original and interconnected films and shows set in the “Star Wars” galaxy were announced. At that same event, additional spin-offs and shows for countless other Disney-owned movies were announced, including “Moana” and “The Princess and the Frog,” leaving few recent hits to exist on their own.
There is a lot of unique storytelling value in cinematic universes. They allow for deep exploration of a single fictional setting, and they can be true triumphs of worldbuilding. Developing a huge cast of characters allows for satisfying crossover events, like “The Avengers” or the Season Two finale of “The Mandalorian.” Multiple entries in a single canon allow for enjoyable genre-bending, like Marvel’s comedic “Thor: Ragnarok” or the recent sitcom-style mystery show “WandaVision.” One of the most exciting aspects of a cinematic universe is that it creates room for multiple creative voices. Lots of different artists with unique styles and backgrounds are able to create content with beloved characters in an established universe. One delightful metaphor: It’s sometimes said that George Lucas built a sandbox and invited everyone else to come play in it, and tell their own stories in the galaxy he created.
Harry Potter’s universe is no stranger to spin-offs. The two-part play “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is a brilliant theatrical experience that primarily focuses on an adult Harry’s relationship with his son. The controversial “Fantastic Beasts” films (expected to be a series of 5 movies) explore the rise of the dark wizard Grindelwald through the lens of magizoologist Newt Scamander. The Wizarding World is vast, and a Harry Potter Cinematic Universe could explore every corner of it from fresh angles, reaping the benefits described above.
Regardless of the direction this new series takes, “Harry Potter” is first and foremost a series of seven books. Unlike the previously mentioned cinematic universes, the heart of the Wizarding World is in a set of texts. “Harry Potter'' made reading cool, and the books inspired a generation to be more creative and imaginative. It’s sad to think that one day “Harry Potter” could be associated more with movies and shows than with novels. This new series and all future content will have to consistently live up to the magic of the books, which were magnificently detailed and shaped a believable world just under the surface of our own. There will be a lot of pressure on the creators involved with the series to fill these shoes.
Would this new series be able to safely fit in with the established “Harry Potter” canon? A major characteristic of the MCU and “Star Wars” franchises is their emphasis on continuity. Great care is taken to ensure that there are no contradictions or timeline errors between films. For a Harry Potter Cinematic Universe, would the books take canonical precedence over their film adaptations, or vice versa? There are already some timeline contradictions with the “Fantastic Beasts” films — will new content resolve them, or only exacerbate the problem? There will be a small number of fans (including this writer) who agonize over every tiny detail and will be tortured by the inconsistencies, but for most viewers, it will never be a problem. The “Harry Potter” fanbase is young, and children are less likely to engage in the very adult discussions of precisely when Professor McGonagall was born or the nuances of Bellatrix Lestrange’s family tree.
As with all conversations about “Harry Potter” these days, there is an elephant in the room. This past summer, J.K. Rowling garnered vehement criticism for expressing and defending beliefs widely condemned as transphobic in a series of tweets and a personal essay — you can find a detailed breakdown of the situation here. For many members of the trans community — you can read the thoughts of two of them here and here — this felt like a heartbreaking betrayal from a childhood idol. Some diehard Potter fans no longer believed they were welcome in Rowling’s Wizarding World. To the dismay of many, Rowling legally must be involved with all original “Harry Potter” stories. It is therefore unsurprising that news of a “Harry Potter” series drew passionate criticism, as it will result in Rowling’s financial benefit. This negative association may kill the project before it’s even born. Do Rowling’s beliefs warrant her complete deplatforming and the resultant end of storytelling in the Wizarding World? That’s a complicated question that deserves a more thorough exploration in a different piece.
The new “Harry Potter” series will likely be in development for many years, if it ends up getting produced at all. In the meantime, “Fantastic Beasts 3” is set to wrap filming next week for a July 2022 release. And when theaters worldwide are able to safely welcome back patrons, “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” will open its doors to audiences once again.
Let’s be honest, even this tiny scrap of “Harry Potter” news is getting a lot of attention — a whole new show is sure to attract quite a substantial audience. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a magical place that continues to awe and inspire. Pursuing a Harry Potter Cinematic Universe unlocks enormous potential, and this could be the enthusiastic opening of a new chapter in one of the world’s most beloved stories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 30, 2021 at 1:50 p.m.
Applicants to Harvard’s Class of 2026 will not be required to submit standardized test scores as part of their application to the College, the Admissions Office announced Friday.
“Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard College is extending our standardized testing policy through the 2021-2022 application cycle,” the announcement reads. “We will allow students to apply for admission without requiring ACT or SAT test results.”
Students may still choose to submit test results or self-report scores, but they “will not be disadvantaged” if they do not do so.
In the announcement, the Admissions Office wrote it will continue to conduct a holistic review of each applicant by weighing factors other than test scores, such as community involvement, employment, and family obligations.
Students who received pass-fail marks on their transcripts or only pursued limited extracurricular activities due to coronavirus restrictions will not be penalized in the admissions process, per the announcement.
“Their applications will be considered on the basis of what they have presented,” it reads. “They are encouraged to send whatever materials they believe would convey their accomplishments in secondary school and their promise for the future.”
Though the Admissions Office will waive the testing requirement, it will invite accepted students who choose to enroll to submit standardized test scores for “academic counseling, placement, and institutional research.”
Friday's updated admissions policy comes 10 days after the College Board announced it was discontinuing both its Subject Tests and SAT with essay to “reduce and simplify the demands on students” during the pandemic.
Harvard first waived testing requirements in June 2020 for applicants to the Class of 2025, following the lead of other Ivy League institutions.
As of Friday, Columbia, Cornell, and the University of Pennsylvania are the only other Ivy League schools to indicate they will waive testing requirements for the Class of 2026.
CORRECTION: Jan. 30, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania were the only other Ivy League schools to waive testing requirements for the Class of 2026. In fact, Columbia had announced Thursday that it would also waive the testing requirement.
