After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is fall 2013, and contra the expectations of two years ago, the most-watched campaign this political season is not the off-cycle election for New Jersey’s governor. Instead, all eyes are on President Obama’s choice for chairperson of the Federal Reserve, a position that will soon be vacated by Ben S. Bernanke ’75 after nearly eight years in office. The successor will be one of two individuals—Janet Yellen, current vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, or Larry Summers, former Secretary of the Treasury, chairman of the National Economic Council, and president of Harvard University.
In terms of who would perform a better job keeping the Fed’s monetary policy on track, we believe both candidates are viable options. While Yellen’s views on central banking are well known from her current position as vice chairwoman and from her time as the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Summers’s ideas about national monetary policy are more opaque to the general public. Yet both qualify as members of the New Keynesian school of economics, and there is no reason to believe there to be major differences in policy between the two figures. Both are inflation doves, subscribing to the opinion that curbing inflation is not as important to the national economy as weak output and growth.
But Summers’s history—notably as president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006—gives us reservations about his ability to helm the world’s most powerful economic institution. He has a history of brusque and controversial statements, such as his comment about differences in mathematical and scientific ability between men and women that cost him his prestigious job here in Cambridge. Part of the responsibility of Fed chairman is to keep the markets calm, and we have doubts that the colorful Summers can maintain the staid and sober disposition necessary for the position.
Summers’s leadership style also gives us pause. While some tread lightly in observing, “his widely acknowledged intellect is offset by imperiousness that makes him hard to work with,” others have gone so far as to term him a “bull in a china shop.” He has also been accused of creating a hostile environment for female employees. At Harvard, Summers faced controversy for his dispute with African American studies professor Cornel West.
Janet Yellen simply lacks the baggage that will make Summers’s job more difficult on day one, and she benefits, by all accounts, of her technocratic, Bernanke-esque demeanor. There are enough reports of Summers’s explosive management style to suggest that Yellen would be the far safer and more sensible choice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s Miss Utah, Marissa Powell, drew the attention of the national media this summer as she flubbed up a response in the question-and-answer portion of the Miss America pageant. Powell’s response to the question, “A recent report shows that in 40 percent of American families with children, women are the primary earners, yet they continue to earn less than men. What does it say about society?” was inarticulate and nonsensical, eventually ending with the unfortunately phrased declaration that we need to “create education better.”
 
Although Miss Utah entertained America with her cringe-inducing gaffe, she missed an opportunity to discuss an important issue. The question references both a Pew Research study released in May that discovered the increase in female breadwinners, as well as the oft-cited statistic that women still make an average of 77 cents for every dollar made by men. These are important and relevant statistics that deserve lip service beyond a meaningless demand that we “create education better.” 
What does this say about society? It shows that our societal impression of the average American family is out of check with reality. The most common argument made for why we don’t need to care about the fact that women are still on average paid less than men is that the wage gap decreases when you control for factors such as job choice, time taken off, and college major. The argument is that women freely choose to take time off in order to raise children or naturally gravitate toward lower-paying fields, and that’s okay because women and men are fulfilling different but equally respectable roles in society.
This line of reasoning, however, makes far less sense when we are no longer talking about a traditional two-parent family where the husband brings home the bacon and the wife takes care of the kids. As the Pew study demonstrates, women aren’t just taking jobs to occupy themselves or to bring in a little extra cash; they’re taking jobs to support their families. If more women are taking on the breadwinner role, then there’s probably more to the story than the idea that they choose to bring it upon themselves. 
It’s not just about different choices that different people make. Women face institutionalized pressures to gravitate toward lower-paying fields or to be less assertive when trying to get ahead in their careers. Some workplaces don’t offer leave, making it difficult for working mothers to succeed at their jobs. The issue can’t simply be reduced to the fact that women choose to go into different fields or choose to leave their jobs to raise kids.  
This raises obvious societal implications. It says that we still need to do a better job of recognizing the reality of women working as a legitimate option and not merely an unfortunate backup plan. Foregoing a career in order to have children is a perfectly reasonable choice for women to make but not a necessary end that everyone should strive toward. Women certainly can choose not to be breadwinners, but the idea that they always should is an outdated mindset that arose during a time when society also believed women to be incapable of having careers. 
Even once we as a society shed this antiquated belief, we must explore the reasons other than outright discrimination to not be satisfied with the status quo. The wage gap amounts to an average of $11,000 per year, and when women lose that money, families lose that money. When the main argument against those trying to change the wage gap is that we shouldn’t care and it doesn’t matter, the prevalence of households dependent on women’s incomes gives us a very clear reason to care. 
Care we must. We must take proactive steps to reduce the wage gap. We should pass legislation such as the national Paycheck Fairness Act, which would close loopholes that engender workplace discrimination. Regardless of how widespread workplace discrimination is, workers should have the tools to combat it when it does arise. We should work to get more women into STEM fields, as these tend to be higher paying and are currently dominated by men. We should increase the minimum wage, since women tend to disproportionately hold minimum wage jobs. We should try to increase salaries for valuable jobs that are traditionally female and traditionally underpaid, such as teachers. We should work to create more affordable childcare options. And we should try to establish workplace policies that better accommodate working mothers so that women do not fall behind in their careers when they choose to have children.
So, what do these statistics say about society? They say that the wage gap is not simply a result of autonomous choices that women make. And they say that we as a society need to work to eliminate it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I expected myself to be pleased when Evelynn Hammonds stepped down as Dean of Harvard College. After all, I am a strong advocate of student voice in democratic university governance and of the importance of student journalism; it’s clear that The Crimson staff’s April 4, 2013 editorial was one of the first and most directed calls for her resignation. This call followed news reports of Hammonds’s involvement in multiple secret rounds of email searches, including one expressly illicit search, in connection with last year’s Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” cheating scandal.
In part, I am happy that Hammonds has left her post as Dean of College: After this year on leave, she will be getting back to her academic work in the history of science department, something I’ve long wished she would do more of. (For the record, Hammonds has said herself that her resignation was independent of the scandal and prompted only by a desire to return to research and teaching. But just as former Harvard President Larry Summers’s resignation is consistently narrated as a direct result of his controversial commentary about women in science, I am sure that Hammonds will be remembered for her connection to the email scandal.)
Mostly, though, I’m disappointed not in our former Dean, but in Harvard. It’s a shame that when Hammonds found herself in a position of power, she misused that power. But the fact that she did so speaks more to the incredible institutional momentum of Harvard than to a failing of Hammonds’ personal character or ideology.
Perhaps my disappointment comes because I truly admire Evelynn Hammonds. Hammonds’s life story is impressive. She was one of the first black women to enter a physics graduate program at MIT. Her later academic interests are fascinating and important: As a history of science and studies of women, gender, and sexuality concentrator, I have read Hammonds’s papers multiple times and appreciate her work on race, sexuality, and science. Hammonds herself was an important part of the feminist movements in science that I am writing my senior thesis about. How did such a wonderful critic, feminist, and activist become the object of student anger? When did she turn into “the Man”?
I don’t know what Hammonds was thinking when she decided to search Resident Deans’ email accounts and then mislead the press and the Harvard community about the email searches. Similarly, I don’t know what she was thinking when she met with Occupy Harvard and told us that the College and University would not listen to our political demands and would respond to student protest by shutting down the Yard “for our safety.” I don’t know what she was thinking when she told students last fall that Harvard’s sexual assault policy would not change to a standard of affirmative consent, a change that would benefit survivors of sexual assault. I can only hope that she felt guilty, ashamed, or conflicted about her position in those situations.
Harvard could not have selected a better feminist and academic than Hammonds to lead Harvard College. Yet I assume that Hammonds, like Drew Faust, got tangled up in the administrative structure of Harvard as it hurtles headlong into a frenzy of corporatization and public relations mania.
Of course, this is not to say that Hammonds accomplished nothing as Dean of Harvard College. For example, she made a valiant effort to reach out to students for their perspectives on College life and alcohol policy. She certainly worked hard to respond to student demands for more queer spaces on campus, convening a working group that resulted in the formation of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life. Despite this, Hammonds didn’t do anything to change Harvard’s twin obsessions with public relations and profit—in fact, she helped perpetuate then.
Former Dean of Harvard College and current computer science professor Harry R. Lewis '68 finds it easy to interact critically with Harvard: His blog contains consistently sharp and critical commentary on administrative actions. It’s possible that Lewis’s social capital and privilege make it much easier for him to take such a critical stance toward Harvard’s administrative momentum; maybe, too, Harvard’s administrative culture was less prescriptive when Lewis was dean ten years ago.
Whichever way, I hope that when Hammonds returns to Harvard next year, she will begin speaking frankly about Harvard culture in a way that she did not as dean. And perhaps more importantly, Harvard should not rest content with our University’s morality after one offending Dean appears to have been ousted. I’m certain that Hammonds’ actions were not the cause, but rather just one manifestation, of a University ideology obsessed with public image at the expense of community trust.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today we celebrate the second day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. On this festive day it is customary to gather together and eat foods that symbolize various sentiments and hopes we harbor for the year to come. Perhaps the best known of these practices (and certainly the most delicious) is eating apples dipped in honey and wishing one another a sweet and happy new year: “shana tova u’metuka.”
How appropriate that this tradition corresponds with the start of the school year. With the organized chaos of shopping week upon us, campus becomes abuzz with excitement as students return from across the globe loaded with stories, bustling with ideas, and eager to embrace the many marvelous opportunities this community has to offer. In this exalted state, spirits are high and everything seems possible. “Tabula rasa,” Latin for clean or blank slate, is the expression often used to illustrate this state of renewed reality; a whiteboard wiped clean; an empty notebook waiting to be filled with whatever we dare imagine. In this time, for a short while, the world does indeed seem to taste as sweet as honey.
But there is another layer of meaning in the dipping practice of Rosh Hashanah that is easily overlooked in the frenzy of new beginnings. As we dip the apple in honey and wish each other a sweet and productive new year, we would all do well to remember that the golden goodness with which we coat our fruit is in fact the culmination of the efforts of millions of honeybees that are foraging away to produce just a few drops of nature’s sweet elixir. This is not to say that there is something wrong with enjoying what nature has to offer, far from it, but simply that there is more to honey than sweetness—just as there is more to new beginning than wiping a whiteboard clean and starting fresh. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two more in this regard by looking to the honeybee, whose busy foraging cycle makes Rosh Hashanah’s most celebrated ritual possible.
Bees, you see, know a thing or two about stewardship from generation to generation. It starts from the moment the female worker bees emerge from their cells, they get to work maintaining and refreshing the nursery area, not waiting for the older or more experienced bees to clean up their mess. Instead, they take matters under their own wings and begin immediately to care for the other babies in the brood chamber. There’s an innate sense of cohesion in the hive that permits totally new bees to emerge each season and yet have continuity and ritual in the actions that keep the colony viable. To some degree, the bustling of peer advising fellows and peer counselors and club officers ushering in new members of the community is very much similar to the renewing forces in the bee world. Newly minted upperclassmen assume the responsibility of seasoned veterans, and a new year and another cycle begins afresh.
There are other small synergies we have with bees at this time of year. The joie de vivre in swarming about the Yard, finding new niches for ourselves, and directing those around us toward the good stuff. In many ways our lives are like those of bees—cyclical and seasonally dependent. Bees fly, forage, and fan during the summer and shiver, cluster, and eat all winter. But while bees finish their honey collection and storage before the onset of winter, students work all year long, storing and fanning new nectar into crystallized knowledge. Unlike the bees in their nooks and crannies in trees, our honeycomb is infinite and composite each year we return to the Harvard hive and beyond.
The honey itself, these bees, have so much potential to embody industrious ideals and inspire us during this celebration of the Jewish New Year as well as on the eve of this new semester. But more than sweetness for the future, honey is not only the symbol of looking forward with optimism, but it also reminds us to remain cognizant of the miraculous sequences which underlie so much of what we might take for granted.
This Rosh Hashanah we urge you to dip your apple in honey and wish each other a sweet new year. Just don’t forget to thank the bees when you’re done. Shana Tova!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part IV of a four-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2017, based on data collected by The Crimson in an online survey conducted in the month of August. Part I ran on Tuesday, Part II ran on Wednesday, and Part III ran on Thursday.
They scored well on the SATs, but it appears Harvard freshmen aren't quite as good at scoring in bed.
Only 35 percent of the Class of 2017 had sex before coming to Harvard, according to a survey of incoming freshmen conducted by The Crimson last month.
Of those who have done the deed, the vast majority—81 percent—said they lost their virginity in high school, and most—62 percent—said they have only had sex with one partner.
Recruited athletes seem to be having better luck: 53 percent of them said they have lost their virginity. In comparison, only one third of incoming Harvard freshmen who were not recruited to play a varsity sport reported that they have had sex.
Sexual activity was just one of a range of topics explored in The Crimson’s email survey of the incoming freshman class. The survey drew 1,311 respondents—nearly 80 percent of the Class of 2017—although not all of them completed every question on the survey. Exploring beliefs, anxieties, habits, and vices, the final installment of a four-part series on the survey’s results looks at how the newest members of the Harvard community live their lives when they are not building their resumes.
DOING THE DIRTY
Men were more likely than women, private school students more likely than public school students, and Jews more likely than any other religious group to report having had sex before they arrived on campus.
Respondents who identify as homosexual or bisexual are more likely than their heterosexual counterparts to report that they have lost their virginity. Forty-five percent of homosexuals and 56 percent of bisexuals reported having sex versus 35 percent of heterosexuals. Of those freshmen who say that they are questioning their sexuality, only 20 percent said they have had sex.
Forty percent of private school students said they lost their virginity before Harvard, compared to 33 percent of public school students, 18 percent of charter school students, and one of six homeschooled students.
Among surveyed freshmen, self-reported sexual history also differed between religions. Mormons, Hindus, Muslims, and Protestants reported the least sexual activity, with 0, 16, 25, and 28 percent respectively saying they have had sex. According to the survey, half of Jews, 38 percent of agnostics, 36 percent of atheists, and 34 percent of Catholics have lost their virginity.
Males, on average, reporting having had more sexual partners than females did—1.95 for the former and 1.70 for the latter. Seven men claimed to have had sex with 10 or more people, but were excluded from the averages of sexual partners.
ASKING FOR HELP
The Class of 2017 arrives on campus in the wake of a year that saw students call for reforms to the University’s mental health services.
As Harvard increasingly encourages its undergraduates to utilize the University’s growing mental health services, the vast majority of incoming students who were surveyed—87 percent—said they have never sought mental health counseling. Among those who have, most said they come from middle- and upper-class families. Twenty-one percent come from the survey’s highest income bracket—a combined parental income of more than $500,000 a year—and 61 percent come from families with an income of $125,000 a year and higher.
Heterosexuals are the least likely sexual orientation to say that they have attended counseling: only 12 percent reported having done so. Thirty-three percent of students who identify as bisexual said they have been to counseling, as did 18 percent of those who say they are homosexual and 14 percent of those who say they are questioning their sexual orientation.
Even less likely to say they have attended counseling are those who plan to compete on Harvard’s athletic fields and courts. Eleven percent of those who identified themselves as athletic recruits said they have been to counseling, compared to just 7 percent of prospective varsity walk-ons.
LIGHTING UP
According to Freshman Dean Thomas A. Dingman '67, survey data collected by the Freshman Dean’s Office through alcohol.edu, an online alcohol prevention course completed by incoming freshmen, has found that about 70 percent of undergraduates do not identify as drinkers before arriving in Cambridge. But The Crimson’s survey indicates that members of the Class of 2017 are not strangers when it comes to booze.
Sixty percent of respondents said they have tried alcohol, and 35 percent of surveyed freshmen claimed to drink at least once a month. Sixty-four percent of men and 57 percent of women reported having had a drink. Eighteen percent of surveyed students from urban areas, and 9 percent overall, said they have a fake ID.
While 22 percent of respondents said they have tried marijuana, only a small minority reported having tried hard drugs. Less than one percent said they had tried cocaine, and less than two percent said they had done mushrooms. Less than three percent reported having tried ecstasy or molly, a colloquial term for a form of the drug. Men were slightly more likely than women to report having tried marijuana, while the two genders were just as likely to report having tried hard drugs
CONFIRMING STEREOTYPES
Harvard University has long had a reputation as a bastion of liberalism, and the survey respondents do little to buck that trend. Sixty percent identified as liberal, 25 percent called themselves moderates, and only 15 percent said they are conservative. And while 239 students described themselves as very liberal, just 33 identified as very conservative.
Along religious lines, the Class of 2017 is noticeably more divided. Thirty-two percent of respondents described themselves as either atheist or agnostic, while 42 percent identify as Catholic or Protestant and 9 percent as Jewish. Smaller percentages identify as Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, or Mormon.
Twenty-four percent of surveyed freshmen identified as either religious or very religious, with Protestants, Muslims, and Mormons more likely to do so than their peers. Respondents who identified as Jewish were the least likely of those who reported a religion to describe themselves as religious or very religious.
PLUGGING IN
Microsoft may have roots in Cambridge, but it seems that in Harvard Yard, Apple is king. Sixty-eight percent of surveyed incoming freshmen said they own a Mac, and 70 percent said they have an iPhone.
Seventeen percent of respondents said they have Androids. All but nine percent of respondents said they have a smartphone, and only one percent of surveyed freshmen said they are entering Harvard without a cell phone.
Those from families with a higher income were significantly more likely to report owning a Mac laptop or an iPhone. Ninety-three percent of those whose parents’ total income is over $500,000 a year—the highest income bracket on The Crimson survey—have an iPhone, compared to only 55 percent of those students whose parents together make less than $40,000 a year—the lowest income bracket. Similarly, 91 percent of those in the highest income bracket reported owning Macs, compared to 47 percent of the lowest.
And like many millennials, it seems that incoming Harvard freshmen spend a lot of their time using social media. Ninety-seven percent of those surveyed said they have Facebook accounts, and 47 percent said they have Twitter accounts. Respondents reported spending significantly less time on Twitter each day than on Facebook. Among those who have Twitter accounts, the majority reported spending fewer than 15 minutes a day on Twitter, and half of those with Facebook accounts said they spend more than an hour each day on the site.

As Congress prepares to vote on whether or not to take action against Syria, Harvard affiliates warn that given how strongly the Obama administration has endorsed a military strike, the United States risks losing credibility on the international stage if it does not act.
“There is a risk, if we don’t strike, that our credibility as a leader in this role will have decreased significantly,” said Tad J. Oelstrom, director of the National Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
“A lot of that has to do with the fact that a red line has been drawn,” he added, referencing comments made by President Barack Obama regarding the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
E. Roger Owen, a professor of Middle Eastern history, said that if the Obama administration were to deliberately strike Syria, such an action would be perceived as equivalent to declaring war.
However, Owen warned that “Obama will be perceived of as very weak if he doesn’t do something.”
“There is absolutely no point talking about red lines if, when people cross red lines, nothing happens to them,” he said.
Oelstrom said that intervening in Syria would not bring the civil war closer to an end.
“My own personal opinion is that [potential intervention] is not going to do a whole lot to change the complexity of the ongoing civil war within Syria,” he said.
He also said a strike would trigger strong reactions of both opposition and support from the international community.
Owen warned that  military action against Syria could lead to indirect retaliation against American forces.
“If it’s a serious strike against military facilities, they won’t be able to do anything against the United States directly,” he said.
“But they will instruct Hezbollah and the Iranians probably to try to attack some American targets in the gulf.”
Oelstrom said that the key variable in Obama’s course of action is Congressional approval.
“If indeed the Congress supports [action], then I think there is a direct commitment by the President to carry out a limited action that has been described in some ways to date,” he said. “If indeed Congress does not approve [the] use of force, I think that the President now has a real problem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team, led by second-year head coach Tjerk Van Herwaarden, hopes to improve upon last year’s rough 3-13 campaign in 2013.  When Van Herwaarden arrived in Cambridge last year, he brought with him a new system in hopes of changing the direction of the Crimson’s field hockey program.
The challenges of adjusting to a new system were evident throughout much of last season for Harvard, but now, with 18 players returning from last year’s squad, the Crimson believes that the growth and changes that took place last season will show this year.
“I think we are doing really well with the changes we have put forward,” Van Herwaarden said.  “With that in mind, the change means that we need to win more, and I think a great and realistic goal would be to have a winning season this year.”
Harvard will start the year on the road against Massachusetts this Friday night before hosting Bryant for the home opener this Sunday afternoon.  The Crimson will begin conference play on Sept. 21 against Yale in New Haven.
Another reason for Van Herwaarden’s positive outlook on the upcoming season stems from the culture shift that has occurred around the team over the past year.
“One thing that shocked me when I first arrived here is that this team didn’t have an identity,” Van Herwaarden said. “I asked them what they liked to be known for, because every team has that, and we just didn’t have anything like that.”
Van Herwaarden went to work on changing this lack of identity by holding meetings with his players and working on a team mission statement. Van Herwaarden believes that these sessions last season helped his team develop an attitude and style of play on the field that will carry over into this season.
If Harvard is to achieve such success, it will be in part thanks to some key returners from last year’s team. Junior Noel Painter will look to lead the Crimson offense again this year after finishing last season with a team-high five goals. Harvard will also get back fellow junior and All-Ivy selection Caitlin Rea who led the team last year with four assists. Rea also played in Team USA’s Women’s National Championship this past May.
For many of these returners, the spring offseason practices served as a time to focus on the team’s new style of play without having to worry about game preparation.
“This past spring was really helpful for us being able to practice with [Coach Van Herwaarden] and learn all of his different philosophies on the game,” sophomore Elizabeth Jacobson said. “He has been able to work with us longer and challenge how we think about the game.”
While her teammates were active participants in these spring practices, Jacobson was stuck on the sideline rehabbing from hip surgery she had last January to repair her torn labrum.  After six months of rehab and physical therapy, Jacobson says she can once again run pain-free and will be ready for the start of the season.
Joining the team’s veterans will be six freshmen, a few of whom Van Herwaarden expects to have an immediate impact on the team.  Rookie forwards Sarah Finnemore and Marissa Balleza and rookie midfielder Kyla Cordrey should expect to see playing time right away.
“Kyla Cordrey will have a big impact on the midfield,” Van Herwaarden said. “Marissa Balleza and Sarah Finnemore both have scoring ability.  People will know who these freshmen are after this season.”
With freshmen being relied upon for valuable minutes, Van Herwaarden will look to his veteran leaders to guide the team early in the year. With that said, Van Herwaarden acknowledges that the team lacks natural leaders but thinks it does work well as a unit.
“I think one of the biggest things about this group is that we don’t have very defined leaders that would just be able to control a game and take over,” Van Herwaarden says. “We are going depend on the whole entire team to perform and do well on any given day.”
Not only will Van Herwaarden be depending on his entire squad to work together and lead, he will also be looking for them to embrace a new attacking style of play.
“[This season] I would love to play with a lot of attacking flow and creativity, Van Herwaarden said. “We love to see creativity in our offense. Creativity is just so important to encourage because it shows a love of the game and that they have a passion for it.”

Heading into the 2013 season, this year’s version of the Harvard men’s soccer team looks a lot like last year’s. The team, which opens Friday against Iona, graduated only four seniors and brings back two of its top three goalscorers, both goalkeepers, and the team’s assists leader.
However, while the team on the field—especially the defense—has stayed mostly intact, the team has a new coach patrolling the sidelines. According to senior defender Ross Friedman, it is the new coach, Pieter Lehrer, who has made all the difference on a team of returning players.
“We have the same guys, but this is a completely different soccer team,” Friedman said. “We are playing at a higher level, and mentally and physically, we are more prepared than we have ever been. As a unit, we are all on the same page, and we are playing completely different. We are going to be coming into the new season with a renewed focus, and we will come out flying.”
Immediately after arriving to campus last April, senior midfielder Kevin Harrington said that Lehrer has changed the entire atmosphere of the program, which has found itself mired in three straight losing seasons. Friedman said that Lehrer, who was previously an assistant coach at California, has brought his imprint to the team while simultaneously being receptive to player input.
“Coach has come in and really imposed himself on our program,” Friedman said. “He has made changes his way, and he has given the players a lot of freedom to express themselves, and it’s been great, the way that he has accepted the role openly. He has given everyone a say on how we are going to run the team.”
Lehrer has put a focus on implementing a defense-first mentality. During practice, Friedman said, the team has worked repeatedly on how to neutralize the strengths of opposing offenses—pressuring outside backs and attacking offenses at their weakest link. According to the senior defenseman, the team hopes to dictate the flow of the game with the pressure they provide on defense.
“The defending and our pressure are everything,” Friedman said. “Where we are on the field and how we are going to play teams is key. When we are playing solid defense and defending at such a high level the entire game, it’ll be tough [to score on us]. That is something that we are working on and has been a stress for Coach Lehrer since I got on campus.”
Once the defensive style of play is established, Harrington said, the team can move forward in implementing more aggressive counterattacking offensive strategies when the opposing defense finds itself off balance.
But for a team that won only three games last year, and none in the Ivy League, the senior midfielder said that the focus is on winning.
“When our defense is as good as we can get, then we can move on and begin implementing more complex things on the offensive end,” Harrington said.
Harrington said that Lehrer has gotten the entire team to buy into his defensive style of play, which plays to the team’s strengths. The team, according to Harrington, is more committed than it has ever been and has completely bought into the message Lehrer has been preaching.
“Outside of the commitment level—higher than I have ever seen it—I would also say the confidence level is higher than I have ever seen it before,” Harrington said. “I think the team is more unified around that commitment and around the willingness to put in as much effort as we possibly can into the season and trying to get as much out of it as we can. With the process going forward that Pieter has implemented, he has everyone buying in 100 percent and committed to doing as well as we can this year.”
Instead of setting larger season goals, the team has focused on taking the season one day at a time. According to Friedman, the team is not thinking ahead to the Ivy League schedule. Its attention is fully on Iona.
“What we focus on is the process,” Friedman said. “While we want to go out and win every game, our team has agreed on focusing on the process as a day-by-day thing. We are focusing on Iona. That’s the only focus right now. After Iona, the next focus is Davidson. We will do everything during and between games to be the best team we can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team opens its 2013 season on the opposite coast, traveling west this weekend to battle it out against California and San Francisco. As a competitor in the USF tournament, the Crimson will match up against the Golden Bears on Friday night and the Dons on Sunday afternoon.
While Harvard steps out on the field for its first match this season, California and San Francisco have already competed in a combined seven games.
“They’ve already started their season and have played great games,” co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “This is our first time out, and I think there’s definitely a lot of learning left on the field, but I think what we maybe lack in game experience we make up for in really good preparation.”
The Crimson is coming off of its sixth consecutive winning season after going 9-5-3 in 2012 but since then has lost a handful of seniors from the roster.
“We lost, obviously, six wonderful seniors who really gave so much to the team, not only on but also off the field,” co-captain forward Elizabeth Weisman said. “The freshmen have stepped in to fill the gap we’ve had in the spring without the seniors there. We’re really happy to have them.”
With the nine new freshmen come three forwards, three defenders, two midfielders, and a goalkeeper. While the rookies’ usual positions span across the field, Harvard’s formation is more fluid than set in stone.
“I think one of the goals this season is just versatility for our entire team and also for individuals who want to play different positions,” Johnson said. “I think a lot of [the freshmen] have been able to show that they are very capable of doing that. They are all going to contribute in a variety of different ways.”
This season the Crimson not only plans on exhibiting versatility, but also depth.
“This is probably the deepest our team has been since I’ve been here in that I think in every game we’ll be able to play far more people and maintain a really good level than we have in the past,” Johnson said.
With the majority of Harvard games taking place in New England this past season, participation in the USF tournament in California marks the Crimson’s first West Coast opener in five years.
“I think we’re focusing on just playing our game and keeping our competitive edge throughout the weekend,” Weisman said. “We know they’re going to be hard teams to play, and they’re great teams, but we’ve been working on moving the ball, keeping possession, finishing—just all things that will help us play well this weekend.”
Harvard still has last year’s high goal-scorer on the roster, junior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby, who netted six goals for the Crimson her sophomore year. Co-captains Weisman and Johnson tallied five and two goals, respectively, last season. Johnson also chipped in five assists, the team high in 2012.
“Our team as of right now is looking great,” Weisman said. “We did really well in both of our scrimmages the past couple of weeks, and all of the freshmen have integrated with the team really well. We gained pretty much a player in every position in the freshmen class. [They’re] doing extremely well and have taken on the challenge of playing with a Division I team really well. We’re very excited about them.”
While the Harvard squad may not have seen game time so far this season, offseason workouts in the spring and summer have shaped the team into a fierce competitor for its opening weekend.
“Our spring was a very grueling one,” Johnson said. “We had a lot of preparation this spring…and I think we’ve been on the same page since our season ended last fall. All those hours in the spring being together and also this summer, keeping this fall in mind hopefully positions us well for the competitive season.”
Friday night’s game begins nine freshmen players’ Harvard careers; however, it also marks the beginning of the four seniors’ final season.
“I’m really excited for a challenging pre-conference schedule,” Johnson said. “I think we have some good tests tomorrow…we’ll be able to prove ourselves really early on. I’m really excited to play and finish off my career with a group of girls who are all incredibly willing to do whatever it takes for the team. I think there’s a really great feeling in our program right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team did not register a shot until the 37th minute of the game and failed to record a shot on goal all night in its 3-0 loss to No. 14 Massachusetts (4-0) in the Crimson’s (0-1) season opener Friday night at Richard F. Garber Field in Amherst, MA.
The Minutewomen were in control of the game from the start as the Massachusetts offense took 12 shots and received nine corners in the first half.  Though senior goalkeeper Jenn Hatfield had six saves in the first stanza, it was not enough to keep the Minutewomen off the board as Massachusetts scored twice off of corners in the span of six minutes.
Junior back Lauren Allymohamed started the scoring for the Minutewomen in the 25th minute off an assist from freshman midfielder Charlotte Vereist.  In the 31st minute, sophomore midfielder Brooke Sabia made the score 2-0 in favor of Massachusetts.
The Minutewomen served as a tough first test for Harvard and second-year coach Tjerk van Herwaarden as Massachusetts is considered to be one of the strongest teams on the Crimson’s schedule this year.
“Playing a tough opponent early on really exposes your weaknesses and shows you what you need to work on,” junior forward Noel Painter said. “We came in with the mentality of trying to upset them and start off the season strong, and though it didn’t work out we saw a lot of stuff in the game film that we can work on moving forward.”
With the Minutewomen dominating the possession battle early on, Harvard struggled to force Massachusetts into turnovers for much of the first half. Sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson attributed much of the Crimson’s early struggles to the speed at which the Minutewomen operated.
“There is definitely an adjustment period shifting from practice to the first real game,” Jacobson said. “Massachusetts plays very quickly, and that only added to the changes we needed to make.”
Harvard came out stronger in the second half and immediately received back-to-back shots from freshman forward Marissa Balleza and junior forward Kaitlyn Boudah.
The increased presence of the Crimson’s attack would have no effect on the outcome of the game however, and the Minutewomen put the game away in the 69th minute with a goal from freshman forward Izzie Delario that made it 3-0.
“The biggest adjustment we made at halftime was changing our mindset,” Painter said. “In the first ten minutes of the game we played well, and then we just got flat going into halftime. I feel like we came out and picked it up in the second half and tried to get every 50/50 ball.”
Harvard’s offense finished the night with only four shots, two of which occurred in the final 10 minutes with the game well out of reach. Balleza led the Crimson with two shots in her first collegiate action.
Harvard’s defense allowed Massachusetts 20 shots, but Hatfield came up big time after time on her way to nine saves in only the third start of her career.
“Jenn Hatfield really stepped up in the goal,” Jacobson said. “She had to face a lot of corners and she made some huge stops. Both of our goalies have been working really hard in practice and it showed [against Massachusetts].”
Though no team wants to start the season with a loss, the Crimson contends that the team has learned from the close game against the 14th best team in the nation.
“I think after we make a few minor tweaks and that we are really going to be a force to reckoned with,” Painter said, “Especially when it comes to the Ivy League.”
