After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School's 11,000 faculty will face stricter regulations governing their relationship with pharmaceutical and medical device-making companies starting January, under a new policy designed to prevent conflicts of interest with industry.
The new conflict-of-interest rules, unveiled Wednesday after an 18 month-long review, prohibit faculty from accepting personal gifts and giving industry-sponsored talks at events where the material is prepared in advance by the company.
In addition, the cap on faculty compensation from outside companies has been cut in half to $10,000 annually, when the faculty member is conducting research on technology owned or licensed by a given company.
“As an academic field of review, conflict of interest is changing,” said Gretchen A. Brodnicki, the school's Dean for Faculty and Research Integrity who led the 34-member review committee. “Our understanding of what is or is not a conflict now may change in a year, a year and a half, or two years from now.”
The policy revisions follow a period of national scrutiny, during which Harvard Medical School and its peer institutions have come under fire for several high-profile cases of undisclosed industry ties.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, first reported in June 2008 that psychiatrist Joseph Biederman of Harvard-affiliate Massachusetts General Hospital received $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees from the makers of drugs that he used to treat children for bipolar disorders.
As Grassley continued his investigations of several Harvard physicians, a band of Harvard Medical School students pushed the administration to tighten its conflict-of-interest rules, calling for a comprehensive policy spanning the school's affiliated hospitals.
While Brodnicki said the school regularly updates its conflict-of-interest policies—the last such review took place in 2004—the committee's recommendations go beyond the scope of the existing policy to include continuing medical education and public disclosure of financial interests, among other issues.
"This is the most comprehensive set of revisions to the policy in quite some time," Brodnicki said.
Crafting a policy that curbs potential conflicts with industry without hampering positive collaborations between faculty and companies is essential, as such work often leads to key developments in clinical research, said David T. Grande, a member of the National Physicians Alliance Board of Directors and professor at UPenn's School of Medicine.
"These relationships are important and ought to continue," said Grande, who was not involved in the school's internal review. "But they have to be done in a way that protects the scientific process."
News of Harvard's revised policy was met with encouragement from student advocacy groups that have voiced their concerns over the past few years about proper disclosure of financial interests and the rigor of conflict-of-interest policies across medical schools.
“I think this relationship between academia and industry is constantly in flux, and so we hope that these policies can be mutable,” said Nitin Roper, a former chair of the American Medical Students Association PharmFree Campaign, which urged medical schools to tighten their conflict-of-interest policies. "We don’t want institutions like Harvard to stick to old ways.”
As Harvard Medical School starts phasing in the new policy, Brodnicki said that she expects to meet some resistance from faculty.
“Not everyone will agree with each element of this report,” Brodnicki said, adding that she looks forward receiving feedback on the policy changes. "That’s very much an important part of our process and our culture.”

For the first time in Harvard history, the Harvard Corporation has adopted a conflict of interest policy to address the financial interests of faculty members on a University-wide basis, officials announced today.
Vice Provost David Korn led the committee that drafted the initial set of guidelines by which all schools across campus will be required to develop their own set of regulations for preventing issues of financial conflicts of interest. Each school's own policy must be at least as rigorous as the ones provided by the Corporation, the University's top governing board.
"The trick is to be able to have a robust system for affording faculty opportunities to engage with the commercial world and at the same time not threaten in any way their own fundamental integrity or that of Harvard," Korn told HarvardScience.
The framework principles of the new policy include a robust system for reporting financial interests of faculty members to ensure that their research and academic activities are not compromised by industrial influences.
Each school will be required to maintain written record of the processes for reporting and evaluating financial interests, as well as sanctions for failure to comply with the rules.
The University's announcement coincides with the Harvard Medical School's release of a report providing recommendations to its existing conflict of interest policy, which has been in effect for 20 years. The Medical School's recommendations will be implemented on a rolling basis starting January 2011.

Former Harvard co-captain Jeremy Lin will sign with the Golden State Warriors in Oakland, Calif. at 11 a.m. PST following a physical examination on Wednesday, Lin’s agent Roger Montgomery confirmed with The Crimson this morning.
Lin's choice of team marks the culmination of much media speculation—including Tuesday night's leak that Lin would sign with the Warriors—about where the Asian American basketball star would ultimately go after a strong showing before NBA professionals in the summer league.
Lin will sign a two-year contract with the first year guaranteed for at least half of its $500,000 value—but the terms of the deal remain undisclosed, according to Montgomery.
Montgomery said that he has been in negotiations with the Warriors for two or three days, and that the Warriors first approached Montgomery after Lin scored 13 points and pulled down four rebounds in an impressive summer league performance against John Wall and the Washington Wizards.
Lin was seriously considering both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks—the team that Lin played for in the 2010 NBA Summer League, according to Montgomery. But Lin chose the Warriors due to the investment they were willing to make and the team’s location in northern California.
“All the components fell in place,” Montgomery said. “The major factors were the guaranteed investment—I truly believe that they don’t look at him as a project… The other factor that this is so awesome is for Jeremy to come home to play. It’s really going to be full circle.”
Lin—an Asian American who grew up a Warriors’ fan in Palo Alto, Calif.—played high school basketball at Palo Alto High School, which is located just 28 mile from the Warriors’ Oracle Arena in Oakland.
Montgomery stated that the Warriors’ proximity to Lin’s hometown has helped land the 21-year-old a number of endorsement opportunities—including a potential shoe deal.
“We’ve had tremendous inquiries,” Montgomery said. “Not ready to confirm anything yet…We feel there will be tremendous opportunities.”

Shoe contracts are typically reserved for just the top few picks in a NBA draft every June. Former Harvard co-captain Jeremy Lin may not have been a top pick—but then again, Lin has never been one to stick with tradition.
Since news leaked Tuesday night that Lin would sign with the NBA's Golden State Warriors, Lin has been approached with a number of endorsement opportunities, including a shoe deal, his agent Roger Montgomery told The Crimson today.
When Lin signs with the Warriors on Wednesday at 11 a.m. PST in Oakland, Calif., he will become just the fourth Asian American to sign an NBA contract—making him the perfect marketing opportunity with the strong Asian American community in the San Francisco Bay Area.
“I think he’s going to shore up our backcourt—that’s for sure,” said Robert Rowell, president of the Warriors. “I also think the signing is going to be great for the Bay Area market. I think he is going to be a lightning rod… We have a very large fan contingent that will be excited to have Jeremy on our team.”
When the Warriors release jerseys with their new logo on Oct. 1, Lin’s are expected to sell like hot cakes.
“He’s going to get them off the rack pretty quickly,” Montgomery said. “I know they’re going to be hot.”
Rowell expects Lin merchandise to be available within the next 30 days.
“As we go through the course of the season, we’re going to create a sub set of our brand with Jeremy Lin,” Rowell said.
But despite Lin’s tremendous marketing potential, Rowell maintains that the Warriors’ decision to sign Lin was purely based on his talents on the court.
“We’re talent first,” Rowell said. “All basketball people think very highly of Jeremy’s skills. It’s just an added bonus on the business side.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Has hell frozen over? No, we're not talking about the fact that an Ivy  League basketball player is about to sign with an NBA team. This is about the fact that there's actually, for once, some legitimate news of  the sports variety coming out of Brown. Congrats, guys. In this edition  of Around the Water Cooler, we'll also venture into the unknown  country that is Belarus and dive into the world of Cornell hockey.
Let's begin with a healthy dose of Ivy League basketball.  In case you live under a rock, Harvard’s Jeremy Lin ’10 is on  the verge of signing with the Golden State Warriors. 2010 has  been a golden year for Ivy League basketball: With Cornell’s run to the  sweet 16, four Ancient Eight graduates playing in the NBA summer league,  and Lin’s impending induction as a Warrior, fans  of Ivy League basketball have certainly been spoiled. Now we're all set  up for a major let down next season when Princeton will likely get  pummeled in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
Lin isn’t the only Ivy Leaguer going pro. Cornell hockey  standout Riley Nash is leaving Ithaca a year early (honestly, who can  blame him?) to travel south to North Carolina where he will join the  NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes. Nash signed a three-year deal with the  Hurricanes—which recently drafted Harvard defenseman Danny Biega—after Nash’s  rights were dealt from the Edmonton Oilers  in June.
Penn announced  today its eight-person freshman men’s basketball class, bringing its  total roster size up to—gasp!—22 people. Did you know that the sky is  now green, and grass blue? No, not really—that’s just what the Cornell  Basketball Blog wants you to think with headlines like “Penn’s  Overcrowded Roster Causes Player Discontent.” For the past few months,  the Internet world has been abuzz news of the Quakers' large  roster size, as though there is no way Penn will be able to manage so  many players. Perhaps there should be a new reality television show called  “Jerome Allen Plus 22” tracking the drama that will surely ensue next  season.
The Quakers’ class is highlighted by Miles Cartwright, a  six-foot-three shooting guard who received a rating of 90 from ESPN on a  100-point scale the website uses to evaluate recruits. Cartwright is  rated the highest of any incoming freshman to the Ivy League by ESPN.
Yale rower Catherine Hart probably never expected to travel  to Belarus, the country that is apparently known for its production of  “metal-cutting machine tools, tractors, trucks and earthmovers.”  Tomorrow, Hart will compete for Canada in the 2010 World Rowing Under 23  Championships held in Brest, Belarus. If Yale’s lucky, she'll bring home a free tractor as her prize.
I know we’re all tired of hearing about soccer at this  point, but Brown has to  get some love for this one. Jeff Larentowicz, a 2005 Brown grad, was  recently named to the Major League Soccer All-Star team. Larentowicz and  his fellow all stars from the US’s professional soccer league will have  the honor of beating up on a weak Manchester United squad that is  sending a mixture of reserves and regulars to compete in an exhibition  match in Houston on July 28.
Brown, hope you have another good batch of news for us next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 12:13 a.m.
Former Harvard co-captain Jeremy Lin concluded a long and unlikely journey to the NBA this afternoon when he signed a multiyear contract with the Golden State Warriors.
Although the Warriors did not release the terms of the agreement, Lin’s agent Roger Montgomery confirmed with The Crimson this morning that Lin will receive a multi-year deal with at least half of his rookie contract—estimated at $500,000—in guaranteed money. It has also been reported that the second year of Lin’s deal will be a team option.
Lin is not only the first Harvard player since Edward Smith ’51 to sign an NBA contract, but the first Asian American, since Rex Walters finished his career in 2000 with the Miami Heat.
Lin, a native of Palo Alto, Calif., grew up a Warriors fan and played high school basketball just 28 miles from Warriors’ Oracle Arena in Oakland.
“This is a dream come true,” Lin told Tim Roye of Warriors.com following his signing. “Obviously playing in the NBA would have been a dream come true but this was really a dream come true because this was obviously the team I grew up cheering for and it’s the one team I really, really wanted to play for.”
Lin settled on the Warriors after weighing offers from the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks—the team that Lin played for during July’s NBA summer league.
The Mavericks were the first team to reach out to Lin after the point guard went undrafted in June’s 2010 NBA draft. Before the conclusion of the draft, Dallas general manager Donnie Nelson reportedly called Lin to offer him a spot on the Mavericks’ summer league roster.
Lin took the offer, and in five games with Dallas, Lin was able to draw attention to himself from the rest of the NBA after an impressive summer league performance in which he averaged 9.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.2 steals in 19 minutes per game.
While the Mavericks made Lin an offer at the conclusion of summer league, Lin opted to sign with his hometown team.
“It was obviously tough [to turn down Dallas] with what Donnie Nelson did for me,” Lin said in an intervew with The Crimson on Wednesday. “It was tough, but I knew that [playing for Golden State] was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.”
Lin said the factors that made him choose the Warriors were “the combination of the current roster, the style of play, the location, and the terms of the contract.”
At a press conference following his signing in Oakland, Calif. at 11 a.m. PST today, Lin said that he is not "really worried" about the pressure of playing in front of a hometown crowd.
"I’m just going to play my game and see where that takes me. And I’m not worried about filling shoes or meeting other people’s expectations," Lin said. "That’s never how I’ve approached the game.”
Having played the vast majority of his college games over 3,000 miles from his hometown of Palo Alto, Calif., Lin does not have much experience playing before a vast crowd of family, friends, and supporters.
When Harvard visited Santa Clara during Lin’s senior season, Lin did not exactly have a career performance. While he finished with a season-high nine assists, he scored just six points on two-of-five shooting—his second lowest offensive output of the season—in front of a sold-out crowd.
“I’ve never really had a game with more support than this game in my entire life,” Lin said following the Jan. 4 contest. “That made me real nervous.”
This will be something that Lin will have to get over quickly if he hopes to crack the Warriors’ rotation. While Golden State has just three other backcourt players under contract as of now for the upcoming NBA season, the Warriors have room to sign three more players before they reach the roster maximum and could be looking to sign at least one more guard.
While Golden State’s starting backcourt is shored up behind Monta Ellis and Stephen Curry, Lin could fill in as a backup in his rookie season.
“I think it’s too early [to speculate about playing time],” Lin said. “I am just going to go into training camp and see what happens.”
This coming fall’s training camp and preseason will be Lin’s last test before the Golden State coaching staff makes a final decision on its regular season roster.
If things do not go Lin’s way, he could end up spending time in the NBA Development League with Reno Bighorns, the minor league affiliate of the Warriors.
But in the coming weeks leading up to the Warriors’ training camp, Lin plans on doing everything he can to make sure he keeps his spot on the Golden State roster. The two biggest things Lin hopes to work on in the remaining summer months are his shooting and his strength.
“From my point of view, I’m ready to go,” Lin said. “I’m ready to play. I’m thankful the Warriors are giving me that opportunity.”
