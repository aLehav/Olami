July 2001. For a moment and a half I was dangling, or rather hanging, from the precarious hands of my cabin counselor who was helping me out of the pool. My untied swimsuit sagged loose around my ankles, my shy buttocks cowered at the sight of the entire co-ed camp, and my humble nine-year-old boyhood startled the female lifeguard in front of me. I nearly broke my chin on the edge ofthe pool when I tried to jump back in and conceal my embarrassment. As it turns out, when a solid object (my swimsuit) moves through a fluid medium (the pool), the fluid induces downward drag against the object and causes it to fall down in front of everyone, leaving me tearful and mortified.
July 2008. My cabin was on the “TC Trek,” a hike through the West Virginia Blue Ridge that began at camp and ended at someswanky campground in George Washington National Forest. We were a few miles west ofthe Virginia border. Around mile nine, soon after I’d finished recounting my sixteen-year life story to the female CITs hiking with us,we reached an acre-wide field mantled with purple and blue wildflowers. A bushel of those flowers thorned the side of my eye as my face hit the ground. I had fallen, nearly fainted, due to heat exhaustion.
August 2010. I was on a counselor day off. I’d been driving around shirtless in a broke-busted station wagon with a Frenchman, a Kiwi, a seven-foot-tall Texan named “Donut,”and three other ex-campers passed out inthe back seat. We’d spent half the day in a tattoo parlor, debating whether or not to do something we would immediately regret,and we’d spent the other half of the day interrogating “locals” and tempting the gravel roads of Route 219 in an effort to find some legendary swimming hole off the northern fork of the Shenandoah River. We never found it and I almost got run off the road bya hatchback, twice.
June 2011. We were halfway down the trail when Joey decided to try to jump a rock witha mountain bike twice his weight. He didn’t jump it; instead, he flipped off and howled in pain as the bike flogged onto his knees. I sent the rest of my cabin off with the other mountain biking counselor. Joey swore his leg was broken; I begrudgingly carried him half a mile back to camp in 90-degree weather. I then accompanied him to get an X-ray at the stodgy Pocahontas County Memorial Hospital, where I spent the entire day staring at taxidermied birds and swapping weather reports with the two nurses on duty only to find out later that Joey was unharmed except for a mild bruise.
July 2011. We were on our way back to camp after another day off when one of the Scottish counselors, who claimed he could drive stick, burned out the clutch of the car. In his defense, the thing was a lemon. Still, with no cell phone service or any other cars in sight, we had to push the car about a quarter mile up a mountain hill until we were rescued by a dubious grouse hunter who called himself “Birdmon” and his oversexed dog named Jazzy.
***
For me, any attempt to summarize the best of my summer camp would be unfair and disingenuous. This is the opposite; these are, from immediate memory, five of my worst days at summer camp—and they are hardly even terrible. I’ve often found that a bad day at camp would be a great day anywhere else. I suppose that’s why, even after the tragic swimsuit incident of my first year, I kept returning.
Being at camp means being tormented and troubled by every hyperactive seven to sixteen year old that crosses my path. It means going to sleep overheated and waking up shivering because of the fickle West Virginia climate. It means being stranded without cell phone service or high-speed internet in the boondocks of the Mountain State where the only civilization for miles is the two-block town of Marlinton—a town known for its dilapidated Dairy Queen and its annual “Roadkill Cook-off.” To be fair, these things never actually bother me; in a way, I actuallylove them. And hell—in the end, I get to spend my entire summer playing with kids in a paradisiacal Appalachian landscape.
My non-camp (“muggle”) friends don’t understand. To them, my camp charades look like an incomprehensible tribal dance deserving anthropological study. I can’t explain to them why we have songs about bananas, moose, boom-chicka-booms, and just about everything else. I can’t explain to them why I return to school each year witha semi-audible part-British, part-Southern accent. I can’t explain to them why all of my glorified summer romances inevitably end in heartbreak. I can’t explain why I always want to cry every goddamn time I hear John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” It’s just a camp thing.
More recently, I’ve felt guilty going back to camp year after year. I’ve forgone internships, travel opportunities, beach weeks, summer classes, and better-paying jobs. Of course, being at Harvard only exacerbates those feelings of guilt: there’s a relentless specter here that implores us to succumb to our overblown résumés and professional shortcomings.
For the past eleven years, I’ve been steeped full of provincial moonshine and left clambering to some quixotic camp wonderland in the crossroads of West Virginia. Every one of those years, I have tried to convince myself that I won’t return to camp, that it’ll be my last summer there and that—next summer—I’ll start taking myself seriously. But, every year, I have gone back. This upcoming summer will be my last time, for real, though. I swear it, I think.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
b.good, a Boston burger chain with a location on Dunster Street in Harvard Square, announced on Wednesday that it would begin to franchise later this year.
The burger restaurant originally opened eight years ago as a healthy alternative to traditional fast food restaurants.
At the time, co-owners Anthony S. Ackil ’99 and Jon J. Olinto wanted to reinvent fast food with fresh and healthy ingredients to fill a niche in the market for food “made by people, not factories.”
Ackil and Olinto hope to sell two franchises and open at least one new branch before the end of the year.
According to Ackil, the first franchises will probably be located in the Boston area so that the current co-owners can easily offer support.
However, after a few years, Ackil said, new locations would open outside the Boston area.
As the restaurant expands, Ackil said that he expects franchise owners to share his commitment to nutritious food and individual relationships.
He added that new franchisees should have the entrepreneurial drive to overcome the obstacles in the “tough business” of restaurant management.
Franchisees will undergo a rigorous training process of several weeks until they have learned the skills to operate the restaurant without direct supervision.
“We’re going to take it slow and make sure the franchisees have the right brand and culture,” Ackil said.
Ackil and Olinto have spent the last eight years streamlining their business model in anticipation of the day they might pass their b.good onto other entrepreneurs.
In the last eight years, the pair has created a strong brand that should facilitate an easy transition to the franchise model, said Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
“They’ve worked very hard and have a done a wonderful job in branding their product,” Jillson said.
The owners have narrowed down a lengthy menu—which once included steak dinners and rice and beans—to a few simple options made with natural meats, cheeses, and seasonal vegetables from local farmers.
They have also worked through kinks in their labor recruitment and marketing. For example, they have played with their marketing strategy to appeal to the younger clientele at their Harvard location.
“We had always talked about seriously exploring franchising. You have to have a really strong economics and unique concept and we think we’re ready,” Ackil said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sietse K. Goffard ’15 started off his Saturday by doing laundry, but not his own—he was one of 20 students either living in or assigned to Currier House helping at the local Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, washing linens, cleaning bathrooms, and tidying the kitchen.
“I couldn’t think of a better way to serve and to get to know new members of Currier House,” Goffard said.
Goffard’s Currier trip is one of twelve community service events organized by the College Events Board, in collaboration with the representatives from different Houses. The joint venture, called Harvard College Serves, is in its first year and hopes to introduce freshmen to the communities of their newly assigned Houses through public service initiatives.
Eliot House kicked off the initiative on Friday morning with a trip to Cradles to Crayons Giving Factory in Brighton, MA. That afternoon, Dunster House also paid a visit to the organization. Events in Currier House and Pforzheimer House followed on Saturday, and the other eight Houses will hold their events throughout March and April.
For Assistant Dean of Public Service Gene A. Corbin and College Events Board advisor Ken A. Parreno ’11, the series of events provides an opportunity to combine House spirit and public service. Parreno said that this combination of factors was crucial in the choice to hold these events soon after Housing Day.
“For incorporating public service with building a community at Harvard, this is a pretty good time,” Parreno said. “Freshmen are looking forward to the next three years, but they’re also looking outward and seeing what public service at Harvard can be like.”
These goals for the programming directly informed the intended size of the Harvard College Serves events.
“We want to make sure these events are big enough so you can get to meet people but not so big you lose the intimacy,” Parreno said.
Corbin said that each event will be able to accommodate approximately thirty students. But some houses faced challenges attracting freshmen: only six freshmen signed up for Eliot House’s event. Just one of those freshmen ended up attending the event on Friday morning.
Nadine R. Rubinstein ’13, a public service representative in Eliot House, attributed the low turnout to the scheduling of Eliot’s event.
“We got the 9:30 a.m. Friday slot, so no freshmen wanted to come,” Rubinstein said. “Some of the other houses have gotten 25 sign-ups.”
But Parreno said that he hopes the program will inspire the students to continue engaging in the community.
“We really hope that freshmen or upperclassmen or whoever participates sees this as a beginning to get involved in public service,” Parreno said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 25, 2012, at 3:53 p.m.
For the first time, prospective Harvard students will have swipe access to all freshman dorms and upperclassmen Houses during Visitas, the College’s visiting program for admitted students.
Administrators instituted this change to make the visit safer and more enjoyable for both current and prospective students, said Director of Visitas Valerie A. Beilenson ’07.
“Current students and prefrosh will no longer need to leave doors open or ‘piggyback,’” she said.
Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said having swipe access will also improve prospective students’ visiting experience.
“It is not hospitable to welcome our guests and then make them dependent on their hosts being there each time they return from an event to let them in,” Dingman said.
He added that there have been incidents in the past in which students were locked out of the dorms or Houses where they were staying for the weekend.
Though Soo Y. Han ’15, who stayed in Holworthy as a prefrosh, said she never found herself locked out for an extended period of time, as she just asked someone passing by to let her in, she noted that her visiting experience would have been more convenient if she had swipe access.
“I think it’s good that the students get swipe access because they get the true experience of what it’s like living at Harvard,” Han said.
As a host, Whitney A. Lee ’14 said hosting prefrosh was made “really annoying,” by the fact that they were not given swipe access. In particular, she recalled how she had to wake up in the middle of the night to let in her prefrosh, who had stayed up late to get a proper exposure to Harvard’s social scene.
“The only other alternative is propping the door, which is against school rules,” she said.
In order to determine the best means to implement temporary, universal swipe access to residential buildings in a safe way, Beilenson said the Visitas planning committee met with different groups, including the Harvard University Police Department, the Office of Student Life, the Freshman Dean’s Office, and University Operations Services.
In response to concerns about maintaining proper level of security, Dingman said he is “confident we will be in good place” as long as students use their best judgment when letting people into the dorms.
He added that the card that prefrosh use to get access to dorms, Houses, and dining halls will be deactivated after the visiting program ends.
Visitas Program, which is designed to provide prospective students with an idea of what life is like at Harvard, will take place April 21 to 23.
Nearly 1,300 admitted students attended Visitas last year, and Beilenson said she expects a similar turnout this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning to campus from Spring Break, some students did not pack away their flip-flops, suntan lotion, and shorts. As temperatures were unseasonably high from the Midwest to the Northeast, students in Cambridge enjoyed 70-degree Fahrenheit weather—a remarkable 30 degrees above the typical monthly average.
Highs of 77 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday and 75 degrees on Friday neared previous record highs, while Thursday’s 78 degrees temperature broke the previous record.
“It’s a beautiful day to be outside,” Charlotte M. J. Friedrichs, a visiting student from Germany, said on Friday. “This is my second semester here, and the weather has always been the opposite of what I expected.”
Many students spent time in sunbathing, studying, or eating meals outside on the campus lawns.
“There is an overall mood of happiness on campus, when the weather is nice,” said Peter M. Riley ’14, who had his lunch outside the Science Center last Friday.
According to Earth and Planetary Sciences professor Peter J. Huybers, March temperatures have risen for a combination of factors.
“March temperatures have steadily increased due to an increase in greenhouse gases—a warmer climate and maybe a more veritable climate has led to the likelihood of higher temperatures,” Huybers said. “But these temperature extremes go beyond what we would experience from that.”
Huybers added that this additional extremity is due to an abnormal variation in the jet stream, which swung further down south than usual.
“It reached down to latitudes of the Gulf of Mexico and sent hot air from south to north,” Huybers said.
This hot air from the South had a significant impact on temperatures in the Northeast as well as in the Midwest and Great Lakes region, Huybers said. In Burlington, Vermont, the temperature hit 81 degrees on Wednesday, breaking the previous record of 68 degrees. The same day Bangor, Maine, reached 83 degrees, breaking the city’s previous record high of 64 degrees. In Marquette, Michigan, the temperature reached 81 degrees, leaping past the previous record of 49 degrees.
“The Gulf [jet] stream set up and moved very slowly,” Huybers said. “And because of that slow movement there was more time to direct hot air from south to north.”
This aberration led to day-after-day warm weather in Cambridge—and in other cities like Chicago, where the temperature reached 80 degrees on eight out of nine days.
According to Huybers, these variations in the jet stream are common at this time of year, but overall climate change has combined with abnormally large variations to produce record-breaking temperatures.
“To put it succinctly,” Huybers said, “climate change is loading the dice, and now we are tending to get higher numbers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a crazy year for Harvard athletics. Titles, both Ivy (football, men’s basketball, women’s soccer) and national (Rebecca Nadler, Ali Farag, Amanda Sohby) poured into Cambridge at an unprecedented rate in the year’s first two seasons. Can the run continue in the spring? That remains to be seen, but a handful of squads look posed to claim—or, in some cases, defend—Ancient Eight crowns. We break it all down in this week’s Power Rankings.
5. Women’s Lacrosse (2-4, 0-2 Ivy)
After two victories in its first three outings, including a 9-8 double-overtime win against No. 13 James Madison, the women’s lacrosse team has struggled of late. Currently on a three-game skid, the Crimson has a chance to reverse its current streak and notch its first conference win on Saturday against a middling Yale squad. Co-captain midfield Melanie Baskind and junior midfield Danielle Tetrault each have 10 goals so far, tops for a squad that averages 8.50 scores a game.
4. Men’s Lacrosse (3-3, 1-0 Ivy)
After coming into the season with a top-20 national ranking and what some believed was the best recruiting class in Ivy League history, the men’s lacrosse team split its opening six contests. Despite the run-of-the-mill start, perhaps no Crimson athlete has been more dominant this spring than senior Jeff Cohen. The attackman has tallied 23 goals this season, and his 3.83 goals per game was tied for second best in Division I lacrosse through March 18.
3. Men’s Volleyball (13-3, 5-2 EIVA)
Oh, how the times have changed. Through 16 contests at this point last year, the men’s volleyball team was 7-9 and in the midst of a six-game skid. Fast forward to 2012, and the Crimson holds a 13-3 mark and has won eight of nine. The one loss in that span? To Pepperdine, then ranked eighth in the country. Harvard sits at second in the conference standings, a half game up on St. Francis.
2. Softball (10-4)
The rust showed in the Harvard softball team’s first matchups of the season as the squad dropped three of five at the South Florida Tournament. But over spring break, the Crimson found its 2011 form and steamrolled to eight victories in nine tries. And so far, last year’s biggest stars are shining again. Sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange, the defending Ivy League Rookie of the Year, currently sports a .400 batting average along with three home runs, 12 RBI, and a 1.711 OPS. In the circle, senior Rachel Brown has made hitters look silly and boasts a miniscule 0.64 ERA.
1. Men’s Tennis (14-1)
No Harvard team is hotter right now than men’s tennis. Having won 14 of 15, including 10 in a row, the Crimson captured the ECAC Division I Indoor Team Championship and the Hilton Mission Valley Spring Classic, bested No. 16 University of San Diego, and leapt into the national rankings at the No. 16 spot. The Crimson will begin its quest for yet another honor—the Ivy League title—on April 7, when the squad travels up to Ithaca, N.Y. to face off against Cornell in Harvard’s Ivy opener.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 26, 2012, at 1:55 a.m.
Nothing went right for the New York Knicks Friday night as Jeremy Lin and his teammates dropped their first game under new coach Mike Woodson against the Toronto Raptors, 96-79.
New York shot 37.6 percent from the field, with no one on the roster making more than six shots. Toronto benefited from a great game by DeMar DeRozan, who scored 30 points in addition to Andrea Bargnani's 21.
Lin had a relatively quiet night, shooting 3-of-9 en route to six points to complement his four assists in 26 minutes of play. Amar'e Stoudemire led the Knicks with 17 points and six rebounds.
New York resumed play on Sunday against the Detroit Pistons.

Jeremy Lin and the Knicks got back on track at Madison Square Garden on Saturday against the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons stayed within close range for most of the first three quarters, but New York pulled away in the fourth to cruise to a 101-79 victory.
Lin scored 13 points in 24 minutes and finished with three rebounds, three assists, and two steals.
His seven turnovers led the team, which finished with 17. Detroit held a 23-20 edge in points off turnovers.
The game marks the fourth in five nights and the sixth win in the past seven games for New York.
The Knicks will be back in action on Monday night against Milwaukee.  Last time New York played the squad there were significant playoff implications. In that match up, the ailing Knicks narrowly lost their fourth consecutive road game in a game where Lin also committed plenty of turnovers.  With the loss, the Bucks inched to two games behind the Knicks for the eight and final playoff spot in the east.
Since then, the Knicks have gone 6-3, while Milwaukee has made up ground. The Bucks, who are currently one game behind eighth place, have the chance to overtake their competitors and establish momentum in Monday’s matchup.
With both teams peaking at the right time, the game will surely be an entertaining opportunity for Lin and the Knicks to show off their game. It should also give the new-look Knicks a taste of a playoff-like atmosphere.

After a four-goal spurt early in the second half, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (4-3, 2-0) overpowered Dartmouth with a convincing 15-10 victory at Harvard Stadium Saturday, preserving its undefeated record in Ivy League play.
Led by five goals from senior attackman Jeff Cohen and four goals apiece from sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp and co-captain Kevin Vaughan, the Crimson’s (4-3, 2-0 Ivy) 15 goals marked a season high. The win is Harvard’s second in a row following a two-game losing streak that briefly dropped the team’s record below .500 and puts the Crimson in a tie for first place in the conference with Cornell and Princeton.
“It’s always good to get a win in the Ivy League,” Vaughan said. “I don’t think I’ve ever been 2-0 in the Ivy League before. Dartmouth’s a solid team, and it was good to come out and take it to them.”
The Big Green’s (2-4, 0-1) efforts kept it within striking distance for much of the game. After entering halftime trailing 7-4, Dartmouth sophomore Brendan Rotanz scored early in the third quarter to bring Dartmouth to within two goals.
But a minute later, the Crimson countered with the first of four straight goals, all in a 45-second span. Cohen netted the first two, Eipp continued the run with a close-range score, and Vaughan sliced through the defense and fired a contested shot to extend the lead to 11-5 with just under nine minutes to play in the third quarter.
“All around the field, guys were making plays,” Vaughan said. “It was nice to get a lead and keep that lead the entire game.”
Dartmouth responded with the final goal of the quarter, but the 11-6 deficit proved insurmountable for the Big Green. The fourth quarter saw four goals from both teams, with Harvard comfortably ahead the whole way.
“Overall, I was very happy with our effort throughout the game,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We came out right from the start playing well. I thought we moved the ball really well; we were patient and disciplined and very unselfish on offense, which allowed us to get great shots.”
Harvard built its lead primarily through its domination of the possession battle. The Crimson picked up 32 ground balls, 10 more than Dartmouth, and enjoyed a 19-10 advantage on faceoffs, allowing it to string together multiple possessions and goals in a row. Freshman attackman Keegan Michel won 18 of his 24 faceoffs, including five straight during Harvard’s third-quarter run.
“[Michel] did an awesome job,” Vaughan said. “He was winning faceoffs in bunches and allowing us to have fast breaks and a ton of possession.”
Wojcik also pointed to Michel’s performance on faceoffs as crucial to the Crimson’s victory. In the pivotal third quarter, Michel allowed Dartmouth only one faceoff victory out of seven attempts.
“Our MVP for the game was Keegan Michel,” Wojcik said. “He was outstanding throughout the day.”
Thanks in part to Michel’s strong faceoff play, Harvard had four unanswered goals in the first quarter after Dartmouth’s Colin Delaney scored to break the 0-0 tie. Again, Cohen, Eipp, and Vaughan led the early attack, with Cohen netting two of the four goals.
Cohen, tied with Colgate’s Peter Baum as the nation’s leading goal scorer (4.00 goals per game), has now tallied five goals in three consecutive contests.
“Jeff Cohen continues to shoot the ball as well as anyone in the country,” Vaughan said. “It’s easy to score goals when you have those guys playing well.”
Though the Crimson allowed 10 goals, Wojcik was pleased with its defensive effort, given the up-tempo nature of the game. Despite committing five penalties, Harvard held Dartmouth scoreless on all five man-up opportunities while scoring five man-up goals of its own.
“I was really happy with our man-down defense,” Wojcik said. “We were a little undisciplined in terms of penalties, but our defense allowed us to keep that two- or three-goal lead.”
The Crimson was also the more efficient team on offense.
Both teams totaled 36 shots, but Harvard put 27 of its shots on net, as compared to only 17 for the Big Green. And with Crimson freshman goalkeeper Jake Gambitsky tallying seven saves, the Harvard attack ultimately overwhelmed Dartmouth.
“Our defense is playing solid,” Vaughan said. “We’ve got a lot of good players out there, a lot of good athletes. Our goalie, Jake Gambitsky, came up with some awesome saves. We’ve got a lot of leadership down on the defensive end, and we made the stops we needed to make.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Braving blustery and choppy conditions on the Charles River on Saturday morning, the No. 12 Radcliffe heavyweight crew out-rowed Boston-area rivals to take first place at the sixth annual Beanpot in the first race of the spring season.
Facing Boston College, Boston University, MIT, and Northeastern, all five Crimson heavyweight crews fared well against their local rivals, with four notching victories to help Harvard begin the spring regular season on the right note.
“I thought we had a really strong performance,” Harvard coach Liz O’Leary said. “When you start off the season with four of your five boats [winning] in the regatta, it’s terrific.”
With the start of its race, the Radcliffe first varsity eight launched off the starting line and powered down the course despite brisk tailwinds that churned the water on the river and provided challenging conditions for all crews sprinting on the Charles.
But the Black and White handled both the elements and the local rivals as the Radcliffe 1V finished the course with a winning time of 6:25.9—the Black and White’s fastest Beanpot finish in three years.
BU completed the course 6.2 seconds behind with a time of 6:32.1. In the battle for third place, Northeastern was able to edge out MIT. The Huskies finished 0.6 seconds ahead of the Engineers with a time of 6:38.3.
BC finished last, 15.2 seconds behind MIT with a time of 6:54.1.
O’Leary cited this past winter’s warmer temperatures as an influence in the team’s high level of performance this early in the season.
“The mild winter that we had gave us the opportunity to get in a lot of practice on the river, and it showed in our races,” O’Leary said. “Everyone performed as well as I could have expected at this time of the year. Hopefully we can continue to make good progress, but I’m proud of the performance that we had overall, especially at this point of the season.”
With a first-place finish in the 1V, combined with victories in the 2V, varsity four A, and the varsity four B, Radcliffe laid claim to its fifth Beanpot title in six years and also retained ownership of its head-to-head trophies—the Allen-DeWolfe Trophy and Rowlands Cup—for its victories against BU and Northeastern, respectively.
During the second varsity eight race, the Radcliffe 2V established an imposing lead over the field early on and never looked back, cruising to a comfortable victory. The Black and White 2V went on to post a winning time of 6:34.2, nearly 20 seconds ahead of its competitors. Northeastern, BU, and BC finished in quick succession, placing second, third, and fourth with times of 6:54.0, 6:57.5, and 6:58.0, respectively. The MIT 2V finished last with a time of 7.08.2.
“Overall, we had a really exciting day. It was fun being back in race mode, and I’m proud of the whole team,” junior rower Marisa D’Orsogna said. “Doing well here on our home course in our first race has set us up to keep working hard for the rest of our season as well.”
The Radcliffe varsity four A and varsity four B crews also stormed away to wide-margin victories, with the varsity four A winning by more than 10 seconds in 7:28.8 while the varsity four B finished 12 seconds faster than its rivals with a time of 7:44.7.
In the final race of the day, the third varsity eight race, the Black and White 3V started off strong but was unable to keep up with the rapid strokes of BC and Northeastern, which finished in first and second, respectively. In the race, the Radcliffe 3V finished last, just under 14 seconds behind in the first-place Eagles.
After strong performances during the fall season and this year’s season-opening Beanpot Regatta, the Black and White just might have found the momentum builder it needs as it looks ahead to its highly touted head-to-head matchup against national defending champions Brown, set to take place next weekend in Providence, R.I.
“[Brown-Harvard] will be an exciting race to watch,” O’Leary said. “It will live right up to what it has always been. I have tremendous respect for Brown, and they are the national champions right now, so they will be a formidable opponent for us next weekend.”

This week outside Hurlbut Hall, Madeline J. More '15 caught up on her reading. Her book of choice? "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins. More said that when she first read the book in high school, her fellow students questioned her on why she was reading a "middle school book," to which she always responded, "Oh shit, because it's good!"
More was one of many students who resisted the allure of Thursday night parties or the necessity of last minute psets to attend the midnight opening of the film adaptation of "The Hunger Games" at the Brattle Street Theatre.
Some students arrived as early as 10:50 p.m., and by 11:30 p.m., a line snaked all the way to the entrance to the Body Shop on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue. Shortly after the doors opened, the line dissolved into a disorganized throng of eager moviegoers. According to an employee at the box office, tickets had sold out by last week, fetching a steep $12.50 when including the $2.50 service fee for purchasing online.
Despite the preparation required to obtain a ticket, not all moviegoers were as well read as More. "I didn't read the books because I didn't want to spoil the movie," said Lydia Ding '15, who attended the showing with classmate Xue Rui '15.
Other students like Nicole E. Granath '15 crammed, reading all three books in four days, "because my friends were so excited." In the ultimate display of devotion, Grant's roommate, Allison R. Harvey '15, came to the movie despite her Psychology 1900 midterm at 10 a.m. the next day. "No one ever graduates college wishing they slept more," she said. She admitted seeing it the next day would have been better for her GPA but added, "I'm here. I'm committed."
Despite the palpable excitement in the air and the obvious dedication of these many students, this was no Harry Potter movie premiere, and few festive costumes were to be seen. Near midnight, Brittany L. Powell '13 pranced up to a group of friends, wearing a floral dress. "Can't you tell?" she asked, "I'm Rue!" For those Flyby readers who haven't read the books, Rue is the youngest competitor competing in "The Hunger Games" and a pretty nifty fighter.
To those of you who haven't seen it yet, we suggest reading this article first. You'll see why.

In this series, we highlight decorative student dorm rooms deserving of special mention. If you think your room is fit to be profiled, let us know!
The first thing that you'll notice as you step into the dorm room of Luciana E. Milano '14 in Pforzheimer House is that it is much more than a mere room. "The theme is homey," Milano said.
From her fanned out stack of "Economist" magazines placed by the entrance to her neatly organized scarves hanging on the door, Milano has gone above and beyond to transform her room into a place where she can unwind. "It's just somewhere to relax, pray, or meditate. Sometimes I'll wake up in the morning and play soft music, brew my coffee, and do my morning prayers. It's a great way to start the day."
Milano lets her decorating style shine through with her color-scheme, curtains, and decorative pillows. She even has her own personal "me area," complete with go-to items like makeup and perfume, along with decorations that represent her background and personality.
"I'm half-Mexican and half-Italian. There aren't many Republicans at Harvard either. I'm one of the few."
She shows off her pride in her heritage and interests with Italian, Mexican, and Republican Party flags.
Her dorm room strays from the typical dorm room set up—futon, collages on the walls, and old bags of chips—by instead introducing inspirational signs, metal flowers taped to the walls, and a special "coffee­­­ station."
"I think that college dorms usually go for a very standard look where people have posters or pictures of their friends taped on their walls, but I wanted it to feel like an actual room with curtains and a color scheme."
If you now feel inspired to transform your own room into an oasis like Milano's while expressing your personality, then follow some of her tips.
1. "Have stations, so that very part of your room is dedicated to something. That's a way to stay organized. Just have things that go together in places."
2. "Making your bed every day helps your room look sort of clean. It's like you go to a hotel and the bed is made. It's a nice feeling."
3. "Dedicate maybe just one day out of the week to do small cleaning things. Whether it's taking out your trash, cleaning your windows, or changing your sheets—college kids forget to do that, but it makes all the difference."
4. "Keep stuff under your bed and buy risers. It gives you so much more space, especially if you have limited closet space."
