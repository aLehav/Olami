After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At times, reading Jim Shepard’s newest collection of short stories, “You Think That’s Bad,” feels like reading a newspaper. His world is full of disasters; people seem to be dying all over the place. Characters are killed by earthquakes, floods, and avalanches; others die by auto-da-fé, by war in the jungle, by brain disease, by miscarriage, by suicide. Such extreme events may seem remote from everyday life, but they become intimate through Shepard’s colloquial language and focus on individual psychology. If newspapers merely inform us about the world’s disasters, “You Think That’s Bad” allows us to experience them.
Shepard’s stories take place all over the world, in many different historical contexts. The locales shift from provincial, Satan-fearing villages in medieval France, to the low-budget film industry in early 20th-century Tokyo. With this variety comes many fascinating, exotic details; Shepard delights in fleshing out his quirky settings. One of the collection’s most imaginative pieces, “The Netherlands Lives with Water,” is set in a futuristic Netherlands dramatically affected by global warming. Shepard draws on the conventions of dystopian science fiction, allowing his narrator to reflect on the state of the environment: “The World Glacier Monitoring Service … had just that year reported that the Pyrenees, Africa, and the Rockies were all glacier-free. The Americans had just confirmed the collapse of the West Antarctic sheet. Once-in-a-century floods in England were now occurring every two years.”
With variegated backdrops and dramatic plotlines, Shepard’s collection consistently entertains. In “Netherlands,” the narrator and his wife Cato try to prevent an imminent flood that could devastate their country—a scenario likely to be found in an apocalyptic Hollywood movie. Although Shepard creates verisimilitude through the accumulation of detail, he also offers suspenseful, fast-paced narration. This skill particularly shines during climactic moments, such as the narrator’s account of the 1953 Dutch flood in which his mother lost her brothers. “Her father returned and said they all had to leave, now,” Shepard writes. “They held hands in a chain ... Once the door was open, the wind staggered him and blew her off her feet.”
But the stories in “You Think That’s Bad” are by no means the literary equivalents of Hollywood blockbusters. Shepard’s astute and disturbing portrayals of family dynamics prevent the stories from seeming shallow, despite their glamorous settings and sensational plots. Although some relatives in the collection love and rely on each other through hard times, Shepard’s attitude toward families remains ambivalent and bittersweet. Rivalries between brothers crop up again and again in his stories. “Happy with Crocodiles” spotlights two brothers and the woman who is probably sleeping with both of them. In “Your Fate Hurtles Down at You,” the narrator falls in love with Ruth, the ex-fiancée of his late twin-brother Willi, who he always believed was their mother’s favorite. When he tries to prove to Ruth that Willi never loved her as much as he does, she cruelly responds: “Do you think you were Willi’s equal?” Shepard seems to share Freud’s view on the relationship between brothers: in these stories, sibling rivalry is a continuation of an Oedipal complex, and the on-going competition for a parent’s attention results in fierce enmity. Yet however eerie these fraught relationships may sound, the darker side of the anthology gives depth, intimacy, and complexity to a style of writing that would otherwise be too plot-driven.
However, Shepard’s strained families and melodramatic plots sometimes become redundant. Most of the stories feature a natural disaster or a war, accompanied by a troubled relationship between family members. It is tempting to draw a parallel between the avalanche that kills Willi and the one that kills the narrator in “Poland is Watching.” As the collection unfolds, Shepard’s tragedies lose their initial emotional impact. It is not long before a kind of disaster fatigue sets in; whenever a new character is introduced, one wonders how long it will be before some kind of disaster kills her. Likewise, whenever a sibling appears, the narrator becomes jealous. Imagine a restaurant with an exquisite specialty but nothing else on the menu—you would not want to eat there several days in a row. Reading Shepard’s anthology cover-to-cover induces similar feelings.
Worse, certain settings seem to be chosen only for their foreignness. This is most evident in “Gojira, King of the Monsters,” set in 1920s Japan. Traces of Japanese culture can be observed in the authoritarian figure of the narrator’s father. But despite this apparent attempt at cultural authenticity, his character seems too exaggerated and lacking in nuance—so much so that he borders on caricature. Also, his relationship with his wife seems too modern and American. During a quarrel over their son, he tells his wife, “Who Toho hires is none of your concern,” and she retorts, “What you do with our son is my concern.” This dispute seems unrealistic, since in 1920s Japan, a deeply Confucian society where women weren’t allowed to vote, it is unlikely that a woman would talk back to her husband in this way.
However, in “Classical Scenes of Farewell,” Shepard succeeds in creating a credible atmosphere of medieval France, employing a more archaic sentence structure and vocabulary and by choosing relatively unusual words with Latin roots. “I was born Etienne,” he writes, “in the diocese of Luçon ... and here acknowledge to the best of my abilities the reasons for those acts that have made this name along with my master’s the object of hatred throughout the region.” Here, Shepard proves that he can modify American English to simulate other cultures, and it is unclear why he chooses not to employ a similar technique in “Gojira.”
But despite the occasional redundancy and flawed depictions of other cultures, “You Think That’s Bad” is an accomplished set of stories. There is a distinct and specific style of writing that Shepard seems to have mastered; his juxtapositions of alienation and intimacy are remarkably skilled. Each of his stories is clearly written, intricately detailed, and highly entertaining. And because many of them are based on much-discussed contemporary topics––even string theory makes a brief appearance in “Low-Hanging Fruit”––they are easily relatable. “Gojira, King of Monsters,” based on the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, feels particularly topical, reading like live footage of this month’s Sendai earthquake. Perhaps the enduring value of Shepard’s collection lies in its ability to convey the human side of such tragedies, much more effectively than any news report could.

Christopher Z. Husch ’13 hung on the wall of Ticknor Lounge with the following quote beneath it: “I’m a feminist because misogyny is stupid. Apathy too.” Husch’s photograph was one of many powerful portraits and printed statements on display for the second annual Feminist Portrait Project. As a part of Harvard’s Feminist Coming Out Day, the photo gallery—with pieces primarily shot by Radcliffe Union of Students (RUS) co-president Abby J. Sun ’13—offered a rich diversity of feminist identities and stories.
Event organizers from RUS, Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, and the Athena program, a Boston-Cambridge high school female mentoring group, chose the Feminist Portrait Project’s wide range of faces to help move feminism beyond its typical white, middle- class stereotype. While some pieces featured short, universal statements like, “I am a feminist because I believe women’s rights are human rights,” from Hannah M. Bacon ’14, others were more personal. Underneath the portrait of Amanda I. Morejon ’13 were the words: “I am a feminist because when I look at my sister and see how beautiful, powerful, and inspiring she is, I don’t want to see a single thing get in her way.”
The gallery also featured photographs and quotes from Harvard’s professors and teaching fellows. One piece offered a personal statement from Harvard Psychology Professor Steven A. Pinker, which read, “the ongoing liberation of women after millennia of oppressions is one of the great moral achievements of our species, and I consider myself fortunate to have lived through some of its major victories.”
In addition to perusing the walls of the venue, event attendees were also able to enjoy spoken word performances that addressed feminist issues ranging from rape to the use of sexist language. Mariel N. Pettee ’14 specifically expressed her anger at society’s obsession with body image. “She looks to you for ‘Thinspiration’/ Now she’s close to starvation / Her beauty reduced to an extremization / Stripping her of any self-admiration / You shout, ‘You’re fat unless you’re near hospitalization’ / And now her self-worth is just a BMI computation,” she recited.
By linking racial oppression with his role as a feminist, NFN Teake ’12 took a different approach to the Feminist Portrait Project’s theme: “Stand Up, Stand Out.” “Need to connect the dots / See the ideological threads that connect narratives of racism, classism, sexism, imperialism together / In the collective psyche each perpetuates the other / We are all implicated / Only difference is whether or not you see it,” he said.
Audience members were also encouraged to take advantage of the open mic and share their own thoughts. At one point during the evening, an inspired Casey J. Thomson ’13 stood up and declared her love and feminist hopes for the art of rap. “It’s time to use rap or whatever medium you want to spread the message that women don’t just have to be booty and boobs,” she said.
Similarly, Willa P. Zhou ’11 offered feminist tips suggesting, for instance, the use of ‘she’ as the default pronoun in essay writing. While she encouraged female participation in public speaking and classroom discussions, English graduate student Chris Barrett imagined even greater progress, saying, “I can’t wait until half of Congress consists of women.”
With such audience participation, many attendees felt that the Feminist Portrait Project was an effective way of presenting a united feminist front on campus and merging activism with art. “It was nice to see so many people show up in support of feminism ... [it] is often a dirty word that people don’t want to be associated with because they think they [will be] ostracized,” said Sarina M. Patterson ’14. “The speakers were fantastic, and spoken word is a great medium for empowerment for minorities of any kind.”

“I am basically a black, white, Irish, Jewish Jehovah’s Witness who plays the violin—the definition of diversity,” said Aaron P. Dworkin, violinist and founder of the Sphinx Organization, a national non-profit group which promotes racial diversity in the classical music world. In his Learning From Performers lecture on Friday, March 11 at the Barker Center, Dworkin attributed this background as one of his motivations to promote diversity in classical music, a field which he says still contains starkly underrepresented percentages of African-American and Hispanic musicians. As this year’s recipient of the Luise Vosgerchian Teaching Award, administered by the Office for the Arts at Harvard, Dworkin was invited to discuss the dearth of minorities in classical music and the efforts that Sphinx is spearheading to bring change.
Each year, the Luise Vosgerchian Teaching Award honors an arts educator who has made a notable difference in students’ lives in the tradition of Vosgerchian herself, the Walter W. Naumberg Professor of Music Emerita in the music department. Thomas S. Lee, the manager of the Learning From Performers program, said “Aaron’s championing of black and Hispanic performers fits really well with Luise’s philosophy: she really made a difference in students’ lives, and he reflects her values.”
The founding of Sphinx, as Dworkin explains, was a product of his atypical childhood. He explained that he was born to an interracial couple in 1970—when interracial marriage was still illegal in some states—and given up for adoption to a Jewish family. His adoptive mother’s love for the violin convinced Dworkin to take up the instrument, and he has not looked back since.
However, Dworkin’s rise as a classical musician is uncommon. Historically, classical music has never been particularly diverse; Dworkin said only two percent of musicians in classical orchestras are African-American and another one percent are Hispanic. According to Dworkin, there are currently no black members of the New York Philharmonic, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra gained its first black musician only in the last six years. Dworkin said that he was either the only African-American student or one of a small handful at every musical institution that he attended, including programs at the Interlochen Center for the Arts and the University of Michigan. He described his shock during his college years when he learned that there was an entire repertoire of African-American classical composition that he had not known existed. This realization, combined with today’s lack of minorities both on stages and in the audience, led Dworkin to found the Sphinx Organization.
The organization, now in its 15th year, is dedicated to combating the imbalance of racial groups in classical music with a variety of programs that reach out to minority musicians. Dworkin said, “we have programs where we put an instrument in the hands of a child for the first time, all the way up to the Sphinx Virtuosi program with [adult] musicians. Our programs run the entire gamut.” These include the Sphinx Orchestra, which is mainly composed of black and Latino musicians, a children’s summer training program, and musical education programs in Detroit public schools. “Sphinx reaches out to people who might otherwise not have the opportunity to study classical music,” said Jack Megan, Director of the Office for the Arts at Harvard.
In his Friday lecture, Dworkin presented statistics that demonstrate the dearth of African-Americans and Hispanics in classical music and shed light on the many initiatives that Sphinx has begun since its founding. It is not only that African-American and Hispanic musicians are lacking today; Dworkin added that pieces by African-American or Hispanic composers are often absent from traditional classical programming. This may seem skewed since many of these composers, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Ludwig van Beethoven, are European, but when only looking at the programming of composers in North America, the absence remains. These problems bring perspective to the Sphinx Organization’s efforts to reverse this lacking diversity.
Despite his shocking numbers, Dworkin’s lecture was not simply a presentation of statistics. He also read a few of his poems that dealt with growing up as a multiracial musician and showed video clips of musicians who credit Sphinx in helping them achieve careers in classical music. One video, called “Sphinx: The Sound of Change,” was comprised of inspirational clips of young minority musicians who have benefited from the Sphinx’s intensive summer boot camp and other educational programs. After presenting the clips, Dworkin added, “By diversifying musicians on stage, the art form really evolves—and that, I think, is a benefit to everyone.”

“Win Win” is a family comedy with an unusual list of participants: an actor-turned-director, an Oscar-nominated star, and a 17-year-old Jersey boy with no Hollywood resume. It tells the story of Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti), a struggling eldercare lawyer who is desperate to provide for his wife and two young daughters. A former wrestler with a love for the game, Mike coaches high school wrestlers in his spare time. But his team is doing about as well as his practice—he’s short on money and his wrestlers haven’t won a match in years.
Mike sees an opportunity to ameliorate his situation when one of his clients, Leo (Burt Young), is in need of an on-paper guardian for himself; Mike takes on the paying job to score the extra cash. But he’s thrown for a loop when Leo's estranged grandson, Kyle (Alex Shaffer), arrives at his doorstep unaccompanied, looking for an alternative to life at home with his drug-addicted mother. Before Mike knows it, Alex is living in his house and, with newly discovered talent, bringing Mike’s wrestling team out of oblivion.
For writer and director Tom McCarthy, inspiration came from the sport itself. “I developed the story with a high school wrestler, now lawyer, Joe Tiboni,” he said. “We used to wrestle together, we were on the same team … and that’s how this whole idea got started—just joking around about high school wrestling, and how there’s really never been a great high school wrestling movie.”
At the center of the visceral wrestling excitement of “Win Win,” though, is a real family man in the form of Giamatti’s Flaherty, whom McCarthy freely admitted was based largely on Tiboni himself. Like Mike Flaherty, Joe Tiboni is an eldercare attorney who is married with two kids. “There were certain similarities that we were cherry-picking for the story … It was fun for us to take something from Joe’s life, put it in the movie, and see it on set,” McCarthy said.
With its eclectic intergenerational cast, “Win Win” falls right in line with the types of films and characters that McCarthy—who recently helped draft the story for Pixar’s “Up”—is used to writing. “[The characters of ‘Win Win’] are pretty ordinary people who just have unique personalities,” he says. “And in bumping up against each other, they reveal something about themselves.  I’m interested in that—in ordinary people and the kind of extraordinary moments that can be developed between them, stories that could fall between the cracks sometimes.”
Bumping against the well-established Giamatti is the film’s younger star, 17-year-old newcomer Alex Shaffer—a New Jersey native who had no prior acting experience aside from a small role in his sixth grade production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “The Pirates of Penzance.” His breakout performance as Kyle has earned him great advance critical claim; Deadline Hollywood named him one of Sundance’s “10 Actors to Watch.”
The low-keyed Shaffer characteristically downplays his accomplishment. But though he lightly dubs his “Win Win” experience “very interesting,” there’s no doubt he enjoyed it. Acting is “something completely new to me,” he said. “I loved it. It is something I’m going to keep doing.” Shaffer noted that being a novice may have been beneficial, because it fended off nerves—as a Hollywood outsider, he felt far less pressure than a career actor whose future depended on the film’s success. This carefree attitude carried over to the set. When asked what it was like to work with Oscar-nominee Paul Giamatti, Shaffer replied with blunt honesty: “At the time I didn’t really care ... I didn’t really appreciate it until now,” he said. “It’s so crazy to be in a movie with him, a Tom McCarthy movie … like, holy shit.”
But because Shaffer is so even-keeled, some of the darker sides of Kyle were difficult for him to portray—especially a scene in which he physically confronts his derelict mother. For these moments, Shaffer turned for inspiration to the story of a much-admired musician: Eminem. “[Eminem and Kyle] have such similar lives,” he said, citing their drug-addicted mothers and the release they each found in a particular talent. In acting out this imagined angst, the Hollywood newcomer hopes he managed to do justice to McCarthy’s complex material. To judge by the critical reaction to the actor’s work, “Win Win” and Shaffer both have a bright future ahead in movie theaters.

Though Cary Fukunaga’s “Jane Eyre” is the eleventh movie adaptation of Charlotte Brontë’s iconic gothic novel, the dark elements of the film overshadow the traditional love story, giving the tale a fresh if not altogether congenial flavor.
Moira Buffini’s screenplay stays true in letter, if not in spirit, to the original novel’s basic storyline. Jane (Mia Wasikowska) is mistreated by her aunt in her youth, attends a dismal boarding school for a time, and ends up as a governess to the mysterious Mr. Rochester’s (Michael Fassbender) young ward, Adele (Romy Settbon Moore). But while the plot is familiar, the movie’s artistic emphases are less so.
At film’s outset, instead of focusing on Jane and Rochester’s mild flirtation as the novel does, Fukunaga chooses instead to direct attention to the mystery enshrouding Rochester’s mansion. The audience is led to overlook the interplay between Jane and Rochester in favor of learning why screams and maniacal laughter echo from the darkest corners of the manor at night. The horror aspects of the gothic storyline are thus privileged over its romantic ones.
Within this claustrophobic atmosphere, Wasikowska’s portrayal of Jane is ideal. Her statue-like stillness—reminiscent of the submissive femininity of the Victorian era—works well in contrast with her piercing gaze, which hints at a fire burning within her ostensibly docile character that societal conventions could not extinguish. Wasikowska walks an emotional tightrope throughout, projecting Jane’s fear and sadness concerning her relationship with Rochester from beneath a socially-imposed mask of passivity. She plays the character of Jane as though on the verge of a mental breakdown, and in doing so makes the emotional pain inflicted upon her character by the film’s events that much more palpable.
Less successful within the film, and particularly its horror-tinged environment, is Michael Fassbender as Jane’s would-be lover, Rochester. In line with the film’s more macabre stylings, Fassbender attempts to fuse Rochester’s charming façade with an element of unsettling instability—but the resulting performance is more confusing than engaging. Rochester’s advances toward Jane come across as desperate and creepy rather than gentlemanly and sweet. Thus, while it is apparent that Rochester is taken with Jane, it never appears as if his intentions are entirely noble, undermining the story’s central romance.
Even as the movie’s tonal choices prove to be of mixed quality, the artistry which creates them serves as the film’s most appealing feature. When Jane wanders around the mansion lost in thought, the film is edited to look choppy and unsteady, aptly reflecting the character’s sense of uncertainty. The same technique is also effectively deployed when Jane flees from Rochester; it is as if the audience is fleeing along with her.
Fukunaga also makes constant use of evocative lighting schemes to generate the movie’s moody ambiance. The scenes concerning the mystery of Rochester’s mansion are appropriately dark—even the audience struggles to see the characters in the dim candlelight. By contrast, those scenes in which Jane and Rochester revel in their love for one another are brighter, even as they are never entirely vivid, in a nod to the constraining nature of the film’s social setting.
Costume designer Michael O’Connor contributes greatly to the film’s realism; his outfits feel authentic rather than like Hollywood-enhanced versions of the period wardrobe. O’Connor’s elaborate 19th-century suits and gowns—complete with hoopskirts—do much to enliven the film’s setting and make it believable; indeed, to take advantage of O’Connor’s talent, Fukunaga shifted the events in the original novel from 1830 to 1840, thereby incorporating a more diverse array of English fashions. The costume design is thus an example of creative license enhancing the novel’s retelling, rather than muddying it, as the film’s darker narrative lens occasionally does.
In the end, while Wasikowska and Fassbender’s on-screen interplay seems to be a little mismatched, the film as a whole does an adequate job of preserving the key elements of the eldest Brontë sister’s classic novel. Though not entirely successful in the endeavor, the film distinguishes itself as a unique adaptation by shifting the story’s tone from one of a classical romance to one of a dark and troubled love affair. Through it all, the film’s exquisite cinematography and artistic choices remind the audience that Jane’s tale is one of sorrow and woe at the hands of fate—circumstances that are only made bearable by the strength that she finds within herself. For all its unevenness, “Jane Eyre” deserves credit for enabling an old medium to convey a new message.

With the university’s resources, or even just a laptop, nearly every Harvard scholar can step into the role of filmmaker and create something that is coherent, intelligent, and—depending on your definition—even artistic. Some professors, noticing this, ask students to craft video presentations in lieu of standard written assignments. Just like a good paper, however, a quality academic film requires thought, time, and passion—criteria that might have intimidated all but a select few from participating in the second annual Harvard Shorts Film Festival.
In keeping with the event’s academic theme, Harvard community members could submit films under two independently judged categories: “scholarly shorts” or “scholarly serials.” Shorts gave participants two to three minutes to communicate a concise point, while the multi-part serials presented a more in-depth look into a given topic.
Of the submitted 16 shorts and five serials, the festival screened the top three entries from each category in Tsai Auditorium on Tuesday, March 8, and awarded cash prizes to the first- and second-place winners. Although the festival’s organizers had trouble filling the theater of the Center for Government and International Studies theater with more than 50 people, they luckily found a community of online voters to judge each entry’s originality, argument, clarity, and production quality.
Even among the top voted entries, however, the winning short, East Asian Studies graduate student Weiyu Tan’s “Into the Dark: Blindness in Edo Japan,” and the winning serial, Professor Shigehisa Kuriyama’s “Riddles,” clearly excelled in the voting criteria. While the winning submissions were reminiscent of a History Channel documentary, their runner-ups felt more like YouTube videos, combining online images with their directors’ personal music preferences. While the third-place short discussed Egyptian homosexuality with a swinging jazz score, Tan narrated the history of Japanese blind minstrels with a series of beautiful woodblock prints and a sad but sweet medley of traditional instruments.
Nearly every submission, however, had its fair share of strengths and weaknesses, with all of them managing to communicate at least some point within a very limited time frame. Although the two runner-up shorts, both of which discussed topics from ancient Egypt, slurred some finer details with rapid narration, they managed to convey that Ramesses II was really not so “Great,” and that royal manicurists were really not so homosexual. And despite East Asian Studies graduate student Jennifer N. van der Grinten’s use of external clips and the esotericism of Steven Anderson’s second-place serial, their directors presented a multifaceted look at modern understandings of autism and empathy, respectively.
Although the serials offered more well-rounded presentations of their topics, the festival’s minimum time requirement may have exhausted the amateur film capabilities of its scholars. Even Shigehisa’s winning serial, despite its creative use of graphics and images, began to sound monotonous and overpowered by background music halfway through the film. However, online voters seemed to have appreciated Shigehisa’s highly original approach to the nature of riddles, both in myth and everyday life. Similarly, Tan’s winning short, exploring the unusual but practical life styles of blind Japanese musicians, may have struck a chord with voters with its ability to place Japanese history within the broad but powerful question, “what would you do if you were blind?”
The festival’s mission, according to its website, is “to illustrate how creative artistic expression can be made integral to scholarly communication.” Already in its second year, the festival’s website and film archive now boasts roughly 30 original submitted short films that either reexamine familiar topics or teach something entirely new. Just from viewing the top voted entries, though, it seems hard to say if the level of participation is meeting the expectations of Kuriyama, the festival’s creator and this year’s serial winner.
Toward the end of the event, Kuriyama himself admitted that the festival’s organizers have had trouble spreading the word about the two-year-old film-screening event. The top submissions in the serial’s category, each directed by either the festival’s creator or fellow scholars in East Asian studies, especially highlighted the need for wider participation. While the festival’s winning directors receive cash prizes, a few more years may be needed for the festival to garner the participation and prestige that it deserves.

“Paul,” the new science-fiction comedy adventure film directed by Greg Mottola, has all the trappings of great entertainment. The movie’s cast—its two notoriously funny leading men, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, as well as its superb secondary crew featuring the likes of Jason Bateman and Seth Rogen—has great promise. Combine such a comedic class act with a host of satirized sci-fi tropes, from Area 51 to the government agents who dependably hunt down alien visitors to our planet, and you have the makings of a great film. However, for all its potential, “Paul” often feels as hackneyed as the science-fiction movies it claims to parody. Fortunately, though the film fails in its attempt to push the envelope, the all-star actors of “Paul” provide plenty of laughs.
The premise of “Paul” is a familiar one: two strapping young men looking for adventure head cross-country on a road trip in the greatest of American vehicles, an RV. “Strapping young men,” however, is not an entirely apt description of Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost). More accurately, they are two paunchy man-children with British accents who dream of making it big in the comic book world. Their road trip is quickly  interrupted by the arrival of Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen), an alien who requests their help. The group soon sets out to return Paul to his mothership—with the military in hot pursuit.
This CGI character of Paul, brilliantly brought to life by Rogen, is the highlight of the film. In fact, the source of most of the humor in “Paul” is not the ability of Frost and Pegg—who are also the film’s writers—to satirize prior films, but rather their ability to imbue Paul with all the reasonableness and sensibility that Graeme and Willy so sorely lack. For example, when Graeme asks Paul if he is about to probe them, Paul retorts, “why does everyone always assume that? What am I doing? Am I harvesting farts? How much can I learn from an ass?”
Paul’s backstory is as cleverly constructed as his dialogue—in one scene, he is shown advising Steven Spielberg—and provides originality in an otherwise undistinguished script. While Pegg and Frost perform well in their familiar roles, Rogen’s alien, by contrast, is stereotypical only in appearance, otherwise exhibiting an unusual penchant for beer, weed, and pop culture references. All in all, Paul possesses the comedic creativity that many of the film’s running gags and various attempts at genre parody do not.
“Paul” is peppered with pleasant surprises from its other supporting actors, including Jason Bateman as a deadly serious government agent, Jeffrey Tambor as a jaded comic book author, and a criminally underutilized Jane Lynch as a waitress at a space-themed diner. Graeme’s love-interest, Ruth, is played with relish by comedian Kristin Wiig, even though the actual role seems to have been written with half the inspiration of her performance. Wiig makes the best of her meager material, namely, a running gag that has her cursing in nearly every line when Ruth—a lapsed resident of the Bible belt—decides to sin with reckless abandon.
All things considered, “Paul” provides mild laughs, with a few side-splitting exceptions, for a decidedly mainstream audience. The film’s commercialized appeal makes for a starkly unfavorable contrast between “Paul” and Frost’s and Pegg’s exponentially funnier collaborations with director Edgar Wright, “Shaun of the Dead” and “Hot Fuzz.”  While those movies pushed audiences’ limits and had resultant moments of comic genius, “Paul” takes a safer—if more lucrative—route, settling for taking easy shots at Bible-thumpers and comic-book nerds.

This past weekend, the Boston Lyric Opera concluded its run of “Agrippina,” an Italian opera written by German composer George Friedrich Handel in 1709. A story of romantic and political deceit, the story centers upon Nero’s power-hungry mother Agrippina (Caroline Worra) as she plots her son’s ascent to the Roman throne. This process is complicated, however, by the amorous relationship between the beautiful Poppea (Kathleen Kim) and the oafish emperor Claudio (Christian Van Horn). The difficulties ensuing from Agrippina’s schemes are skillfully relayed with visual richness, delightful humor, and creative staging, offering viewers a brief escape into scandalous ancient Rome.
The set suggests but does not state its location; instead of including any obvious Roman monuments or landmarks, the production evokes the historical mood with visual subtlety. Two tall, shadowy-white set pieces contain the slightest hint of Italian architecture, presenting faintly-etched columns and archways in a manner reminiscent of the artistic technique of bas-relief.
The set’s only main prop is a sizable stone head, a sculptural remnant from antiquity, like an operatic Ozymandias. Yet unlike the forgotten emperor of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s classic poem, the stone head assumes an active role in the production, and functions almost like a silent additional cast member. Throughout the performance, the sculptural head becomes a surface upon which various characters project parts of themselves. In one scene, Poppea wistfully trails a strand of pearls across the marble Roman’s cheek; in another, the oily Claudius carelessly slings his tuxedo jacket across the stone mass while fervently trying to seduce his beloved.
This seduction scene, in which Claudius unsuccessfully attempts to beguile the beautiful Poppea, is one of the funniest and best-choreographed in the entire production. In a highly amusing dance of physical comedy, Claudius slowly snaps his suspenders and gleefully kicks off his dress shoes to reveal expectantly-wiggling toes.
The opera as whole contains many such moments of humor and playfulness. In one lighthearted scene, Poppea and Agrippina, both clad in luxe red and gold bathrobes, share plentiful wine and entirely false affirmations of their friendship. In another, Poppea luxuriates in a large bathtub, singing all of her arias with a delicacy and grace as light as the foamy bubbles that surround her. Throughout the scene, she toys with, loses, regains, and eventually dons a strand of pearls. Given that most of lyrics sung during this scene describe her romantic indecision, the tossed-about pearls seem to be a physical manifestation of her capricious mental state.
As a counterpoint to this whimsy, however, the opera includes the somewhat ominous presence of ghastly imperial guards, who often lurk at the edges of large-ensemble scenes. The guards, whose faces remain hidden behind gold metallic half-masks, silently stalk, stop, and salute with an eerie stiffness that seems to suggest the ever-present and unbending power of imperial Rome. Adding to this sense of political totalitarianism is the huge stone eye which looms above the set in a few key scenes, an almost overstated gesture of Orwellian control. In this way, it is suggested that despite all the scheming and plotting of the city’s manipulative inhabitants, the political order of the Roman state remains both durable and omniscient.
The show’s use of lighting, though creative in some scenes, often proves unoriginal to the point of detriment. Its most skillful application comes during a scene in which a drunken Poppea stumbles home through the Roman night; the delicate light-blue tones of Italian moonlight make her inebriated revelry all the more boorish and pronounced. In several other scenes, however, the lighting does not enhance, but rather dominates the emotional mood. In one particularly trite song, Nero’s solitude and sadness are made blindingly clear by the single spotlight which follows his capitulating movements across the otherwise-darkened stage.
Musically, one of the most arresting numbers is a piece sung by Ottone (Anthony Roth Costanzo), the commander of the Roman army, and yet another of Poppea’s many admirers. Though the lyrics are not particularly creative—“Poppea is asleep/oblivious to my suffering”—and the subject of unrequited love is hardly an original one, the song itself is clear, elegant, and quietly beautiful.
Though “Agrippina” is ostensibly about the power relationships among men, it is clear that women ultimately provide the driving manipulative force in the plot’s action. This careful yet indisputable power balance is reflected even in the show’s costuming; throughout the performance, Agrippina and Poppea wear almost exclusively red, gold, and purple—all colors historically associated with royalty. By contrast, the men are frequently clad in undifferentiated, forgettable tuxes. As they move about the stage, without ever substantively changing the visual tableau, their costumes suggest that their physical positions, like their political ones, are largely interchangeable. And though these ancient political power shifts are perhaps a hazy subject for modern audiences, “Agrippina” offers a visually and aurally delightful glimpse into the tumultuous history of classical Rome.

Normally, art lovers sneer at the sound of a whisper in museums. While this policy of strict silence is normal in most art institutions, the new “Conversations” photography exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA),  which is on display until June 19, suggests a very different attitude toward artistic discussion. In fact, ‘conversations’ are encouraged, and are indeed the desired effect of the diverse and well-assembled collection of masterpieces.
Upon entering the first exhibit hall, one’s visual field is instantly filled with the vibrant colors and striking size of Thomas Struth’s “Audience 4,” a photograph which gives the viewer the impression of looking into a mirror. In this image, Struth depicts a group of people observing Michelangelo’s famous sculpture “David” in Florence’s Accademia Gallery. At first glance, it appears as though Struth was focusing on the crowd, rather than the work of art itself. But because of the camera’s angle, it becomes clear that the people in the photo are actually looking directly at the viewer, thus making the photograph’s beholder appear to be the true subject of the work.
Similarly intimate moments of observation are captured in other photographs throughout the exhibit. Most notable in this respect is Helen Levitt’s black and white image “New York,” which depicts three young children playing with masks on a tenement stoop in Manhattan. Levitt uses a right angle viewfinder in order to capture the candid moment without the children’s knowledge, yet the small girl’s mask appears to be staring directly at the camera. The mask may be looking at the camera but the young girl may not.. In this way, the photograph juxtaposes delicate, youthful innocence with the potential for secrecy and duplicity, a contrast which sparks further questions of perspective and intimacy.
The dynamic collection of over 100 photographs was assembled with  careful consideration. Curators Anne Havinga and Karen Haas had access to the Bank of America collection, a significant corporate holding of photography, sculpture, textiles, and maps dating from the 18th century to the present.
The Bank of America collection traces its roots to the 1960s, when photography historians Beaumont and Nancy Newhall helped assemble the collection for The Exchange National Bank of Chicago, a former Bank of America institution. In doing so, the pair began a photography collection which would eventually contain samples of every major technological development occurring in the medium, from 19th-century salt prints to early 21st-century digital photos.
The exhibit features a broad array of photographic icons, boasting such names as Man Ray, Eugene Atget, and Irving Penn. Most compellingly, the works of these great masters are often paired with those by lesser known but equally skilled photographers. While the works of the major artists may be highly recognizable and pleasurable to view in their own right, the connections that emerge between the juxtaposed photographs are distinctive and purposeful, often offering to viewers a visual conversation starter.
One of the pairings emphasizes the strangeness in everyday life. William Eggleston’s colorful photograph of a tricycle entitled “Untitled, (Memphis)” is positioned next to Lee Friedlander’s black and white photo “T.V. in Hotel Room, Galax, Virginia,” which depicts a ghostlike child’s face on a television screen. Viewed side by side, these photographs call attention to the beautiful yet vaguely supernatural elements of everyday objects.
Landscapes and seascapes comprise a large portion of the exhibit, particularly the clever juxtaposition of “New York State” by Kenneth Josephson and “Seascape with Yacht and Tugboat, Normandy” by Gustave Le Gray. Le Gray’s photo, taken a decade earlier than Josephson’s, is an expansive and dramatic view of a boat on the ocean, but becomes even livelier when compared to Josephson’s version of an ocean view, which simply depicts his hand, holding a postcard of a boat. The presence of Josephson’s hand, a reminder of his role as the framer of the scene, emphasizes the power of photographers to inform the meaning of a place.
The “Conversations” exhibit is both fresh and familiar; iconic photographs are invigorated by their placement alongside less famous but no less powerful works. The exhibition does justice to its title, sparking dialogue among viewers. After the show at the MFA closes in June, this brilliant collection will depart for Europe—where the conversations, now in foreign tongues, will begin once more.

Chris Brown’s new album, “F.A.M.E.,” makes it clear that he continues to grapple with his past even as he figures out how to move forward. He is still fighting negative press from previous abuse allegations—an occasional theme in his music—and as an artist he is continuing his transition from child phenomenon to fully-fledged adult R&B star. As a result, “F.A.M.E.” bounces between youthful innocence, explicit sexuality, and time-tested weariness. Though it offers many potential hit singles, the album lacks a cohesive sound and style.
The world has already heard over a third of the tracks on Brown’s new album. “Deuces” and “No Bullshit” were released on Brown’s collaborative mixtape with Tyga, “Fan of a Fan,” which came out in May 2010. “Yeah 3x,” “Look at Me Now,” and “Beautiful People” were released as singles over the past year and have been climbing the Billboard charts ever since.
These tracks—some of the best of the album—represent what Brown does best. The international success of “Yeah 3x” is a testament to Brown’s ability to create a chart-topping, party-ready dance hit. The up-tempo beat, bright synthesizers, anthemic chorus, and tween-friendly lyrics work to create a song reminiscent of his 2008 hit “Forever.” “Beautiful People,” a Euro-inspired track featuring copious amounts of Auto-tune and the Italian DJ Benny Benassi, has a clubby house feel.
The album’s standout “Look at Me Now,” a collaboration with Busta Rhymes and Lil Wayne, seems to represent the direction in which Brown wants to head as he matures as an artist. Like “Yeah 3x” and “Beautiful People,” it’s a crowd-pleasing, dance-floor filler, but instead of bouncy synthesizers, it has a spare, syncopated, hip-winding beat, more similar to his 2009 hit “I Can Transform Ya.” Unlike those two more youthful songs, it has sharper lyrics that send Brown’s message of resolute defiance to his naysayers.
“Look at me now / Look at me now / I’m getting paper” is a lyric typical of R&B and rap’s chest-puffing, but in Brown’s sing-song rap and stinging delivery, it becomes an honest statement of growth. “Deuces,” probably a nod to his relationship with R&B star Rihanna, has even more pointed lyrics: “I know you mad but so what? / I wish you the best of luck / And now I’m finna throw them deuces up / I’m on some new shit.” These songs are reflective of a more world-weary Brown looking to move forward and are successful in their own right, although they sound both musically and lyrically as if they come from a different album than “Yeah 3x” and “Beautiful People.”
Unfortunately, the third of the album that we have already heard is the best part. Many of the remaining tracks are unmemorable filler—“Up 2 You,” and “All Back,” the slower ballads on the album, lack the power of the 2008 hit “With You” or even the apologetic “Crawl” even while showing off Brown’s silky voice at its best. “She Ain’t You,” a mid-tempo nod to Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature,” is the new single from the album, but owes its success more to the MJ sample than anything else.
The most distasteful song on “F.A.M.E.,” “Wet the Bed,” featuring Ludacris, is exactly as awful as its title suggests. The dripping noises in the background of the track and Ludacris’s opening lines, “Hear the sound of your body drip / As I kiss both sets of lips” are completely out of place. Brown knows how to execute a good, tasteful sex song, as evidenced by the Grammy-nominated “Take You Down,” but completely fails on this attempt.
In addition to representing Brown’s journey towards maturity and from previous adversity to a new future, “F.A.M.E.” showcases Brown’s potential as an R&B artist. He is a gifted vocalist with an innate sense of how to create hit music. All of the elements of future success are present on “F.A.M.E.,” and once Brown figures out how he plans to move forward as a person and an artist, he will probably produce a more cohesive and much better album, but “F.A.M.E.” is not it.

A cappella aficionado Samuel M. Galler ’12 is an East Asian Studies concentrator in Quincy House. As president of the all-male a cappella group the Harvard Din & Tonics, he recently led the organization on a singing tour around the globe.
The Harvard Crimson: What is your background in music?
Samuel M. Galler: I started very early on. I began playing violin when I was three, and I quit to play the cello when I was four. It’s actually kind of a funny story: I decided I didn’t want to stand up, I’d rather sit down. So I started playing the cello, and that has been my instrument ever since. I started singing in elementary school. We had a fantastic choir, and almost everyone in fourth and fifth grade did it, and that’s what sort of got me into singing. My parents met actually in orchestra, playing violin in college at the University of Toronto.
I stopped singing briefly when my voice changed in middle school, because it got really awkward and squeaky. And then I was playing tennis and I actually got injured, which happened to be a blessing in disguise because I tried out for the school musical. And then that got me into choir and I started doing a lot of musical theater and choir all through middle school and high school, and I’ve been continuing to sing ever since joining the Dins [the Din & Tonics] here at Harvard.
THC: What motivated you to join the Dins?
SMG: I knew I wanted to do a cappella before I stepped onto campus. I was the music director of an a cappella group in high school that was very similar to college a cappella groups—it was completely student-run, and we did most of our own arrangements. We actually had a little bit of mentoring from another a cappella group at Colorado University, and they helped us learn how to arrange and get off of our feet. That was one of the most fun and frustrating things that I did in high school, but I just really loved it. So when I got to Harvard, I tried out for and got into the Dins, and it’s been great ever since.
THC: How was your overall experience on the World Tour?
SMG: We’ve been singing all year, so we pretty much bring our repertoire from that year on tour and sing it again. Although this year we did a couple of new things that I was really excited about; we had a few songs that we arranged just for the tour that were in other languages. We had a song in Chinese that is a pretty famous folk song, which we were able to perform in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. And in all of those places, there were people that knew the song and appreciated that we had taken time to learn a song in their language. We also sang two songs in Japanese that were huge hits all over Japan.
I think that’s something that really distinguishes our group. In the one sense, when we go on tour, we offer American jazz music and American collegiate a cappella, both of which are very culturally indigenous to the United States. But we also try to make a very big effort to acknowledge all the places and cultures that welcome us on tour. We did a lot of introductions for our songs in various languages—we had German, French, Chinese,  Japanese, even a little Icelandic.
THC: Any interesting stories from a particular country?
SMG: One of my favorite countries was Iceland. When we were there, it was the summer and the sun never really set—it sort of ducked under the horizon and got a little dimmer, but it was still light. When we got there, we were a little jet lagged, but we sang at this Viking festival—which was already a little bit weird and crazy. They gave us capes, and had us walk around this festival where people were selling artisan goods and there were pigs hanging from screws.
THC: How do you feel about shows like “Glee” that are putting a cappella groups on the map and giving them a new ‘cool factor?’
SMG: I think it’s great. From our perspective, it’s certainly helped us get a few more opportunities to perform and more respect from professional organizations. We’ve always had a sort of interesting niche since we do jazz—we have a quirky sense of humor and we’re a little bit more old-fashioned in some ways. But I think anything that gives the arts more of a presence in everyday life is a probably a good thing for everyone.

It’s about time I came clean: I, Adam Palay, own—and regularly use—an Amazon Kindle.
Hold on to your knees, readers. As your faithful “art and science” columnist, I hereby present my obligatory will-technology-destroy-literature? column.
I was once myself skeptical of e-readers. I’m an English concentrator. I’m a member of the Advocate. I sport pretentious, thick-rimmed, tortoise-shell frames. Both my bookcase and my roommate’s overflow with my books. Books are an important part of my life—not just the words, but the things themselves. My family’s copy of “The Hobbit” has its cover ripped off, because my dad was afraid its representation of Bilbo would discolor the picture my imagination would paint of him. I’ll never write over the annotations I made in my copy of “King Lear” from high school, the book that made me fall in love with Shakespeare. I never travel without my copy of Wallace Stevens’s collected poems, in case I find myself stuck on a desert island (with adequate food and fresh water) for the rest of my life.
These books, and many others, have a sentimental value as objects that e-readers will never replace.
I say this all up front, because I want to make this clear: the sentimental value of books, while important in its own right, is not a valid argument against e-readers.
Polemics against e-readers almost always end up citing the feel of the book in your hands, and, weirdly enough, the way that books smell. In the November/December issue of the Boston Review, Onnesha Roychoudhuri opens her article “Books After Amazon” with just this rhetorical move: “I am unsure of where I fall on the Luddite spectrum, but I’ll admit to inhaling the odor of leather-bound volumes.”
This olfactory fixation on books is paradigmatic of the central flaw in this sentimentalist’s line of argument: correlation does not imply causation. We love the smell of books because we love the time we spend reading, which usually involves (especially for those of us for whom the activity has caused near-sightedness) breathing through a nose pressed closely to the pages of books. Subconsciously, the smell of the book becomes correlated with the pleasure of reading about hobbits stealing gold from ferocious dragons, so that each time we crack open a musty old volume, that old pleasure steals through us once again.
We love the smell of books because we love reading, not because we love books.
The problem with the e-book debate is that it is distracts us from what reading really means to us by drawing our attention away from words and toward the medium that conveys the words. We cease to speak in terms of what is said, and revert to such absurdities as smells in lieu of rational defense. We point to the smoke, and not the fire, as the source of light and heat.
Books will always be better at some things. You can’t lend out e-books to friends the same way you can lend out books. They don’t yet well convey the visual effects of modern poetry. It’s not as satisfying to throw them at the wall in a fit of anger. But the Kindle and other e-readers remind us that words aren’t bound to media. The need to experience the transformative power of language runs much deeper than the need to make and hold bound pages. Literature has a profound oral tradition; you could argue that old books of poems are analogous to sheet music: they only become art when distilled into sound. When you recite a poem, even alone, you watch the room become enchanted.
Yet somehow we have become attached to the book. Roychoudhuri’s article spells out the evils of Amazon’s business practices toward publishers, some of which indeed are quite abhorrent. Amazon should cut publishers a fair deal. E-books are pure profit, and no one should be unfairly compensated. But we need to take a good, hard look in the mirror. Every external condition of reading—from the smell of old pages to publishing houses’ wellbeing—draws its value from the mysterious act of the imagination that occurs when the mind comes into contact with words and stories. All the trouble we go through, all the money we spend, is a residual effect of this intangible, fundamentally human act.
E-readers are valuable because they free us from the tyranny of the page. Words are not merely marks on acid-free paper, but are, as Steven Pinker titles one of his books, the very “stuff of thought.” When you memorize a poem, it acts on you in ways that just reading it won’t. It invades you like a virus attacking a cell.
Reading on a Kindle these past two months has brought me closer to what I love so much about reading: those long, uninterrupted spells in which the imagination supersedes reality.
I’m even beginning to love the way it smells.

From Denmark to America, and from Hawaii to the Congo, Carsten Jensen’s “We, the Drowned” is global in its reach. But at the center of this wide-ranging sea drama is the town of Marstal, and the stories of its native sailors, widows, and children. Translated from the Danish by Charlotte Barslund and Emma Ryder, “We, the Drowned” is not the tale of one single man or indeed of one single sea venture; the real protagonist of the novel is Marstal itself. Jensen deftly illustrates the effects of time, progress, and war on the small port town as he chronicles its generations from the mid-19th century through the Second World War.
As he recounts the lives of sailors, warriors, and boys and their mothers, Jensen narrates from the perspective of the people of Marstal—the “we” for whom the book is named. These voices are present throughout, casting judgment on the figures that loom large in the history of the town—Laurids Madsen, who flew up to heaven and came back in his boots; Madsen’s son Albert, who undertakes a Telemachus-like quest for his disappeared father; Herman, murderer of man and seagull; and Klara Friis, the widow who dooms the men of Marstal even as she tries to free them from their enslavement to the sea.
The plurality of the narratives that Jensen presents does not, however, distract from the development of his focal characters. At times, the plural voices of the Marstallers recede in favor of other kinds of narration. The most gripping single narrative of Jensen’s novel—Albert’s quest to find his father—is presented as an extract from the sailor’s private journals, and so is told in the first person. Thus Jensen is able to detail Albert’s personal reactions to the shrunken human head—“Jim”—kept by his captain, the blue, tattooed faces of the Kanak crew, and the strange attack on the ship by clouds of thirsty butterflies.
But the collective voice of the Marstallers is never silent for long as they report on the struggles of each new generation. The lives of Marstal men are lost to both sea and war, although Jensen makes a clear distinction between the two fates. Boys grow up knowing that they are likely to die with their boots on—that is, by drowning—but war is another matter entirely: “What was the difference? The difference was that the sea respected our manhood. The cannons didn’t.” Jensen does not glorify naval war; through the eyes of the Marstal men, he reveals naval wars to be terrifying, dirty, and foul. These men are rarely fighting for a cause in which they believe deeply. Rather, they seem caught up in the winds of a wider world controlled by powers such as Germany, Britain, and America.
But sea battles are not the only ones fought by the people of Marstal. Jensen’s collective narration is most convincing when it is from the vantage point of the boys of Marstal, who face their own smaller terrors. In some cases, their trials arrive in the shape of other boys as they form gangs and compete with one another in games of war. In other cases, the boys band together against a common enemy: Isager the schoolteacher. But it is when they join into one mob that they reveal that the world of children can be just as brutal as the world of adults, though on a smaller scale. One of the more distressing moments in the novel is not the death of a man, but rather the death of the schoolteacher’s dog at the hands of the vengeful boys.
If Jensen is at his most heart-rending as he illustrates the cruelty of the boys of Marstal, he is also at his most eloquent as he describes the experience of boyhood. “Every summer,” he writes, “we went to the beach, with its border of dried seaweed that crackled and pricked under our bare feet, its carpet of crushed mussel shells, its luminous green seabed, and its swaying submerged forests of bladder wrack and eel grass.” Jensen is masterful at evoking the landscapes of his novel, whether the idyllic summer world of Marstal boys or the pitching deck of a ship beset by a gale.
While the exploits of men dominate the novel, Jensen is also careful to include Marstal’s female residents, whom he depicts as perpetual widows: “Our women, who have no choice but to stay behind in Marstal, live in a state of permanent uncertainty. Even a letter is no proof that the sender is alive; it can be on its way for months and the sea steals men without warning.” Jensen shows generations of women taking up widow’s weeds—but their roles are not quite as passive their lives of widowhood might suggest. There is Cheng Sumei, the woman behind the decisions of businessmen and shipping makers alike; there is Kristina, who travels the world on a boat her father named for her; and there is Klara Friis, who after losing a husband to the sea tries her best to ruin the town’s seafaring industry so that her son might not share his father’s fate.
A novel like this one, which spans two centuries and covers the globe, might run the risk of being overly broad. But it is the large scope of Jensen’s novel that gives the work its strength. Jensen does not romanticize the life of the seaman or the world of this small port town. The lives of the Marstallers are rough; over the course of two centuries they face the dangers of three wars, the loneliness of widowhood, and the terror of being left behind in a changing world. But the sea, despite the efforts of Klara Friis, is the only constant in the lives of the Marstallers, serving both as the source of their livelihood and, in the case of many of the ‘drowned,’ as their final resting place.

March 24-26, 31, April 1, 8:00 p.m., March 27, April 3, 2:00 p.m. & April 2, 6:00 p.m.
The Agassiz Theatre
Directed by Devon H. Dunn ’12
Produced by Andy G. Brody ’11, Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 & Marissa A. Glynias ’12
Among the Savoy Operas, “The Yeomen of the Guard” stands out for its dark yet comedic tone. “The main message of the play is dealing with love,” writes Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12, one of its producers, in an email. “Sometimes you have to compromise what you most desperately want for the greater good.”
This opera, the 11th collaboration between W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, is set at the Tower of London in the 16th century. The story concerns prisoner Colonel Fairfax, played by Ian H. Clark ’12, and his adventures in love as he attempts to escape from his impending execution.  “Interestingly, Fairfax is discussed more often by the other characters than he is actually on stage,” Clark writes in an email. He describes  his character as a “self-confident soldier/scholar who is well liked despite his cocky mannerisms.”   In one of his scenes, Fairfax successfully out-flirts a competing suitor for the attention of a woman they both love.
This may be one of the most frequently performed operas in the world, but director Devon H. Dunn ’12 has her own approach to adapting the play for a modern audience. Gilfillian believes such an unexpectedly dark show deserves different treatment than a traditional opera. “As ‘Yeomen’ itself rather defies traditional Gilbert and Sullivan characteristics, I think it is only fitting that we try to do the same with the production itself,” he writes. Both Gilfillian and music director Ethan T. Addicott ’14 hint that Dunn’s approach to staging is novel and exciting. “There are some tricks up our sleeves with the set that people will just have to wait and see during the show!” Gilfillian writes.
Addicott is especially excited about the Act One finale, where the song “An Escort for a Prisoner” accompanies the search for an escapee. “It starts off with one character singing,” Addicott says, before it “builds and builds to the entire cast singing.” Strong emotions characterize every musical element of “Yeomen.” “There are many mood changes—happy and sad, always back and forth,” Addicott reflects.  Dunn’s contemporary update of this classic opera promises to bring moving performances to the Agassiz this week.

In 2007, German artist Heiner Goebbels premiered “Stifters Dinge,” an 80-minute performance piece inspired by the writings of Romantic author Adalbert Stifter. The show is primarily grounded in a haunting sonic landscape: a score for piano quintet interspersed with a pastiche of pre-recorded spoken texts. This tapestry of sound is visually complemented by five pianos fused in a sculptural arrangement that moves through a dense environment of fog and video projections during the show. Equal parts theater, installation, and concert, “Stifters Dinge” defies any conventional classifications. Beyond that, it confounds the very notion of a performance, insofar as it requires no performers.
The absence of performers is an essential feature of “Stifters Dinge.” Goebbels’ intent was to create a mechanical performance that unfolds with no human catalyst—in his words, “a no-man show.” The pianos are engineered to play themselves, and the lighting, sound, and projection cues are programmed and timed to the score. The whole event transpires as a fully mechanized sequence that forgoes the need for human input.
Admittedly, “Stifters Dinge” is a groundbreaking accomplishment. But for most actors and directors, conventional wisdom dictates that physical human beings are the essence of drama; theater is the art of one flesh-and-blood performer actively responding to another on stage. Yet Goebbels’s work implies that the performer is no longer a requisite element of live performance. “Stifters Dinge” posits a theater in which machine entirely supplants man.
The tension between theater and technology is by no means a new concern; in 1968, Polish director Jerzy Grotowski deemed technological advancements totally superfluous to theater in his treatise “Towards a Poor Theatre.” He disowned all theatrical technology in one fell swoop: “No matter how much theatre expands and exploits its mechanical resources, it will remain technologically inferior to television and film,” he writes. “Consequently, I propose poverty in the theatre.” Grotowski was a purist: to him, theatre was simply the raw experience of humans reacting to each other on stage—anything more would be a tawdry embellishment, turning out “hybrid-spectacles…without backbone or integrity.”
To that end, Grotowski would most likely object to “Death and the Powers: The Robots’ Opera,” a new opera by composer Tod Machover that opened at the American Repertory Theater last weekend. Much like “Stifters Dinge,” this opera complicates the relationship of performer and performance; baritone James Maddalena sings the lead role of Simon Powers, but spends most of his time sequestered offstage while a chorus of singing robots takes center stage instead.
In the second scene of the opera, Simon Powers transfers his consciousness into a computerized system. He proceeds to withdraw from the stage, and spends the remainder of the show cloistered in the orchestra pit where microphones and motion sensors capture his physical and vocal actions. As he performs, the entire stage design reacts to his every gesture: his physical impulses actively alter a massive display of LED lights, surround sound, and robotic systems. These technologies are a remarkable phenomenon that Machover has deemed “a disembodied performance.”
The question, then, becomes whether this integration of technology and live performance bastardizes the theatrical form. It may seem as if Goebbels’s innovation and Grotowski’s theatrical poverty are irreconcilable; however, Machover’s notion of “disembodied performance” could be a point of reconciliation. Much like Goebbels, Machover fully embraces technology—but rather than abnegating the performer, Machover mechanizes in order to close the gap between the signers and the technology. His notion of “disembodied performance” completely redefines the interface between performer and technology. Maddalena is never displaced by his robotic counterparts; on the contrary, the robots amplify every nuance of his performance.
Grotowski’s concerns aside, the live performer is anything but obsolete. “Stifters Dinge” is an innovative work of performance art that defies genre, but it hardly presages an age when performers will be quaint relics of the past. Furthermore, “Death and the Powers” suggests new ways of putting technology at the service of the performing arts. In a recent interview, Machover said, “I’ve been interested since the beginning of my career in using technology to enhance performance, to enhance artistic experience, and to do it in a way that’s not just humanly interesting but kind of brings human beings to the forefront.”
Machover demonstrates that live performance and technology are fully amenable; he embraces technology specifically to highlight live performance. “Death and the Powers” simply proves that performing artists should rest assured that their craft still lies at the heart of theater, music, and opera—even if their robotic counterparts occasionally steal the limelight.

March 23, 25, 26, 30, 31, & April 2, 8:30 p.m.
Lowell House Dining Hall
Directed by Erin Huelskamp, Lidiya Yankovskaya & Aram Demirjian
Produced by Anh M. Le ’12, Chappell L. W. Sargent ’12, & Ashley N. Kaupert ’12
“From what I understand, it’s never been performed the same way twice,” says Ashley N. Kaupert, one of the producers of Lowell House Opera’s (LHO) production of “Candide.” The LHO’s rendition of Leonard Bernstein’s comic operetta seeks to continue this tradition of innovation.
The story revolves around18th-century tutor Candide and his pursuit of Cunégonde, the love of his life. Originally based on Voltaire’s satire Candide, ou l’Optimisme, Bernstein’s operetta has been rewritten, rearranged, and reimagined by almost every subsequent director due to its initial Broadway failure in 1956. What has remained, however, is the tongue-in-cheek ridicule of optimism in the face of misfortune. The operetta chronicles a series of unfortunate setbacks to Candide’s efforts to win over Cunégonde—including enslavement, disease, and an unscheduled visit to El Dorado. “’Candide’ is actually a very funny show … it’s one of the most popular college operettas,” says Kaupert.
Harvard is no exception: Dunster House Opera performed “Candide” in 1999 and 2005. Staying true to the tradition of the operetta, this year’s “Candide” staff has opted to take their production in a new direction. Unusually for on-campus shows, this year’s cast will feature current and past Harvard students, as well as individuals from the surrounding community. “I’ve learned so much from the alumni in the show. They give ‘Candide’ diversity, and I think that the show will be better because of it,” says Liv A. Redpath ’14, who will be playing Cunégonde in three of the six performances. In addition, the set will involve rotating mirrors and marionette-like puppet strings, among other quirks. “It isn’t easy to put on a production in a dining hall, but it’s wonderful and magical when it all comes together,” Kaupert says.
These technical choices were made partly in response to the challenges of staging “Candide,” whose plot features a variety of landscapes. “We needed on the order of 200 different outfits. The chorus has to be dramatically different people in dramatically different places from scene to scene as Candide travels, including peasants in Westphalia, inhabitants of Spain, natives of El Dorado, and casino-goers in Venice, and more. We have doctors, judges, soldiers, sailors, penitents, inquisitors, farmers, etc. who sometimes have to change in the blink of an eye,” says Antonia M. Pugliese ’12, the operetta’s costume designer. With its globe-trotting comedy, “Candide” promises to be a lively and colorful production.

On “Don’t Try and Hide It” off The Dodos’ latest, frontman Meric Long sings, “What were you thinking / Writing on the rooftops / Waiting for something or maybe someone?” Whatever The Dodos were thinking when they made “No Color,” they were onto something—they have created a dreamscape of an album that is impossible to tune out. The album features frenetic drumming, ethereal guitar picking, and—to top it off—the lovely singer Neko Case; the Bay Area trio has once again put out an album that is strange and full of wonder, leaving listeners with an impression of a world only seen in dreams.
There is an aspect of insanity to The Dodos, especially when their out-of-control musicianship collides with offbeat lyrics. “In my head, it’s only laughter,” croons Long on “Good,” and this sort of deranged mentality pervades the album. Despite originating as a duo, the band managed to make their songs densely layered experimental works. Their first two albums, “Beware of the Maniacs” and “Visiter” are similar to “No Color” in instrumentation, but are much less produced, giving them a rougher feel. The band’s 2009 release, “Time to Die,” took The Dodos in a new direction, adding producer Phil Ek and a third member, vibraphonist Keaton Snyder. The album bore more than a passing resemblance to more established indie acts like The Shins and Fleet Foxes—an unsurprising similarity, given that Ek has worked with both. Despite the addition of a well-established producer, “Time to Die” was a significantly weaker album than the preceding two, perhaps because what made The Dodos special was their unpolished sound and spontaneity, elements that definitely suffered under Ek’s supervision. Thankfully, on “No Color” the band has reclaimed their former ethos, adding fancier production to the inventive instrumentation and dreamy singing that fans have come to adore.
In crafting their otherworldly songs, The Dodos rely heavily on imagery and sounds associated with dreams. The imagery of “Black Night,” the abstract “Going Under” and the tellingly titled “Sleep” all serve to lyrically represent the odd beauty of their innovative instrumentation and offbeat song structures. Long most explicitly invokes this theme on the Hamlet-referencing “Sleep,” in which he repeats “I cannot sleep, I cannot think, I cannot dream”—a statement disproven by the sheer imagination and creativity of the album.
The themes of dreams and sleep are strikingly evoked by the soaring, beautiful vocals and jerky instrumentation which are consistent throughout the album. Album opener, “Black Night,” is simultaneously abrasive and restrained; loud drumming and crazy strumming dominate the track, but Long’s smooth vocals lend a contrasting laid-back vibe to the song. The disjunction between his relaxed delivery and the frantic drums serves to disorient the listener, and the track bleeds into the excellent “Going Under,” a cheerful, poppy track buoyed by peaceful arpeggios and Neko Case’s backing vocals.
Though their sound is consistent throughout the album, the band does manage to vary slight details from time to time, preventing “No Color” from descending into colorless monotony. “Companions” features softer percussion, and uses Spanish guitar work and synths to fill the void. The song reveals The Dodos’ softer side, while “Sleep” ironically drives forward like a machine and culminates in a climactic build.
Indeed, much of “No Color” is meant to be taken in as a whole, unbroken experience in which The Dodos fully envelop the listener in the strangeness of their sound and world. The tracks easily fade into each other and as a result are hard to differentiate; “No Color” seems built as a complete, personal dream sequence, and the world they craft is stunningly evocative. Long sums it up nicely on the opening track: “Black night / Blackness / How I wanted you … All to myself.”
The Dodos invite the listener to drop all worldly cares for 40 minutes and join them on a journey through the depths of the mind. The album’s quiet melodies and jumpy instrumentation are a fanciful portal into the realm of dreams—a place where even an album whose title suggests dreariness can dazzle.

You put out a debut album, then instantly become the favorite band of teenagers the world over. The critics love you too, proclaiming your album a timeless masterpiece, leading the way for a new era of old rock. The songs are catchy and the music videos are quirky, so no one cares enough yet to think about whether the album is really worth such praise. You put out another album that’s equal or arguably better, but most people only notice that it’s not the debut. Save a couple fun singles, you lapse into mediocrity or worse. Years pass and the critics are proven right: your debut was undoubtedly a masterpiece, earning you endless good will from the millions of devotees who will continue to buy anything you put out for the rest of your existence.
If you begin in the ’90s, you’re Weezer; if it’s the 2000s, you’re the Strokes. With their new album “Angles,” the Strokes enter the next phase of Weezerdom, where the urge to measure up to past performance—specifically, 2001’s lauded “Is This It”—gives way to half-assed hyperactive goofiness. Frontman Julian Casablancas is thankfully more reserved than Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo ’06—his inoffensive lyrics and muffled delivery keep the album’s many missteps from becoming full-on novelty style parodies—but “Angles” remains uninspired, an album of antics from a band with few good ideas left.
Whereas most of 2006 failure “First Impressions of Earth” found the Strokes at their most lethargic, “Angles” is aimlessly energetic as the band attempts to hide lack of nuanced writing under dueling guitar riffs and unrelenting neon production. “You’re So Right” and “Metabolism” are the biggest offenders. The former is a sterile Radiohead imitation, complete with tinny drums and rapid-fire vocal repetition, while the latter attempts to combine the worst parts of “First Impressions” singles “Juicebox” and “Heart in a Cage” into another Fuse-ready menace. Both feigned attempts at mechanized paranoia come off as feverish moaning over the Super Metroid soundtrack.
“Angles” is flooded with these types of half-baked ideas pursued at full throttle, which were probably fun to record but make for a frustrating listen. Even the more tolerable tracks on “Angles” have awful bits that negate any sort of emotion the band might have been trying to build. Closer “Life Is Simple in the Moonlight” chugs pleasantly through Casablancas’ confessions of loneliness and envy, and the song builds to provide one of the albums’ only instances of dynamic variation only to come crashing down as Casablancas obnoxiously and arbitrarily croons “Don’t try to stop us / Get out of the way” over the sudden descent.
This isn’t the only wrench thrown by Casablancas, who never actually entered the studio with the band and instead contributed his vocal tracks over email. His strung-out Billy Joel impression on the terribly titled “Gratisfaction” and whining falsetto during the otherwise delicate “Call Me Back” make for some of his worst moments as a vocalist. Casablancas somewhat redeems himself on acrobatic opener “Machu Picchu” and the refreshingly straightforward “Taken for a Fool,” but neither song is interesting or mature enough to be considered a real triumph.
Only one song on “Angles” validates the album’s existence: the propulsive “Under Cover of Darkness.” Their best single since “Reptilia” in 2003, “Under Cover” finds the Strokes briefly rediscovering their strengths and their restraint: vocals that complement rather than mimic the music, bright but not blinding guitar riffs, and genuine enthusiasm that builds after every drum fill. “Don’t go that way / I’ll wait for you,” Casablancas sings to an “adversary and friend,” as he thankfully relies on his lighthearted charms instead of the strained vocal gimmicks that fill the rest of the album. Standing alone, the song is pure gold and deserves its place among the Strokes’ best. Sadly—like Weezer’s “Dope Nose” off 2002’s pitiful “Maladroit”—“Under Cover” seems less like a glimmer of hope and more a final farewell from a once great band as they completely surrender to their most self-indulgent impulses.

The Boston-based band Dirty Dishes might just become the next big thing in the national rock scene. The band, which consists of guitarist/singer Jenny E. Tuite, drummer Mike J. Thomas, bassist Jay S. Marcovitz, and synth player Alex F. Molini, is difficult to classify. Their style is an innovative blend of ambient rock and experimental music, and can be described generally as shoegaze. The genre, however, does not do justice to the immense variety of music the band produces. “It’s kind of hard to classify what we are,” claims Tuite, while Marcovitz adds, “we all bring our own influences to the band.” Such variety has caught the attention of numerous musicians in the Boston area, especially mixing engineer Keith E. Freund.
Freund, who first noticed the Dirty Dishes from a demo on Tuite’s Myspace page, saw so much early potential in her music that he offered to mix and co-produce her first EP. Although at this point the band was not fully formed, the members quickly forged a cohesive bond that has lasted through a successful and extremely busy two years. Soon after their creation, the band released its first EP, “In the Clouds,” which consists of five varied songs ranging from the dreamy pop of “Deer in Headlights” to the heavy metal of “Stolen Apples.” Socrates Cruz ’06, a local musician and friend of the Dishes, praises their EP. “It’s very unique,” he says. “It’s original, yet not self-indulgent.”
Surprisingly, this innovative sound arises from a somewhat standard rock songwriting process. Tuite writes lyrics last and focuses mainly on melodies and harmonies. “I want the music to create the mood rather than the lyrics. The lyrical content just has to agree with the sound of the song,” she states. The band’s sound, however, likely stems from their eagerness to create novel aural landscapes with every song. However, writing varied and novel songs is a grueling process, sometimes taking up to six months for a single track. “A couple of us will flesh out a general song idea and we’ll play with it for weeks or months until we have something ideal,” says Molini. Nonetheless, the band clearly relishes their approach, and they have just finished their second EP. Freund, again mixing and producing the EP, predicts “this next EP is going to show people that it wasn’t just a fluke … that they’re in for keeps.”
Not only successful on record, the Dishes also have a seemingly infinite line-up of gigs arranged on their current tour, which takes them from Maine to Texas. They have been on tour since January and have on average seven or eight gigs a week until April. Freund expresses that the personality of the band members makes them so appealing to audiences. “They engage your curiosity especially when you see them live. Jenny’s such an enigmatic person and front-runner for the band. There’s kind of a mysteriousness or mystique about them where people want to know more.” Freund adds that “Jenny is very much like a lot of the great artists in history that I’ve watched documentaries on. She’s possessed by her vision and the whole band has catered around the same kind of vision.”
This vision has already led to much success and publicity; the band has enjoyed frequent radio play and even short spots on two episodes of MTV’s “Jersey Shore.” The band has already opened for many famous acts, including Passion Pit and Autolux, but Freund thinks that the next stage of their career will take them touring nationally with one such renowned group. “There’s definitely kind of an air and vibe about them in Boston that they are destined for something huge.”

Sprawled drunkenly in the middle of the floor with his feet propped against an elegant mahogany desk, Dr. Frank Bryant (Andrew Long) recounts a lecture he just gave during which he took an inebriated tumble from his lectern. “I may have fallen, my dear,” he says proudly to his tutee Rita (Jane Pfitsch), “but I went down talking and came up talking. I never missed a syllable.”
Willy Russell’s “Educating Rita”—a Huntington Theatre Company production running until April 10 at the Boston University Theatre—is packed with comedic successes. At times, it’s the characters’ mannerisms, such as Frank rummaging through his books murmuring the names of authors only to exclaim “Dickens!” when he finally finds what he was looking for: not a book, but a bottle of scotch. Elsewhere, it’s the witty banter between Frank and Rita. Often, it’s Rita’s comically ridiculous facial expression, as she looks at Frank: eyes wide, eyebrows cocked, a half smile on her face. But the humorous surface of “Educating Rita” hides thematic depth: under the skillful direction of Maria Aitken, this seemingly simple comedy hammers home serious messages about change, courage, the dangers of conformity, and the value of an education.
The story begins with Rita, a hairdresser who enters the Open University in northern England to study literature because she is dissatisfied with her life. She convinces the eternally tipsy Frank to tutor her, and thus begins a complex, mutually educational relationship. As the two meet for their weekly sessions, Rita sweeps Frank off his feet with her unbridled curiosity and hunger for knowledge, and Frank transforms Rita’s world by introducing her to literature, the world of art, and new ways of thinking. Admist countless jokes, the two stumble through issues of gender, class, conformity, social and personal change, and the dangers and value of a “proper” education.
The most prominent success of “Educating Rita” is its ability to stay lighthearted and humorous while dealing intermittently with intense subjects. The effectiveness of this balance is in part due to the comic contrast between Pfitsch’s bustling, sassy Rita and Long’s scruffy, lackadaisical Frank. Even their costumes, designed by Nancy Brennan, highlight their disparities: Rita’s bright blonde hair and orange and green checkered skirt contrast sharply with Frank’s dull brown suit jacket and gray slacks.
Aitken switches to a more serious mood only when necessary. When she does so, however, the actors respond brilliantly. Late in the play, Frank is fed up with Rita’s presumptions. “I don’t think I can bear it any longer,” he says. “Bear what?” she replies. “You, my dear. You,” Long growls loudly, stretching out each word, staring at Rita from across the stage, and leaning in for emphasis. The atmosphere transforms suddenly from carefree to tense.
Aitken also uses subtle cues to drive home the play’s messages, allowing “Educating Rita” to maintain its comic front while remaining meaningful. The lighting, designed by Joel E. Silver, traces Frank and Rita’s relationship; as the two become closer friends, the lighting becomes more natural and warm, entering through the windows in the back of the set, and when the two get more combative, the lighting gets harsher. At one point, Frank switches on the ugly, bright, fluorescent light that was turned off during the first act, emphasizing the growing gap between him and Rita.
Allen Moyer’s set, a realistic and beautiful rendition of a professor’s office, also helps drive home the message of “Educating Rita.” Populated by shelves overflowing with books, papers scattered throughout the room, and an imposing desk atop an ornate carpet and backed by airy windows, its permanence provides a constant reminder of the effect of Rita’s education on her life and views.
In the end, all of these nuances come together effectively with more direct scenes that trace the transformative effects Rita’s education has on her life, herself, and her relationship with Frank. She combats gender restrictions in the form of her husband, who  wants her to stay at home and have children, as well as isolating class divides and personal inhibitions. She upturns all that she once held dear and dedicates herself to an education that, as Frank warned her in the beginning of the play, will change her, and not entirely for the better.
However, by the end of the play it is clear that education has not simply changed Rita’s life. Rather, it has given her the power to change her own life. It has given her choice. As the play comes to a close, Frank asks Rita about her plans for the future. “I might go to France. I might go to me mother’s. I might even have a baby. I dunno,” she responds, her mind bubbling with possibilities. What is important, though, is what she says after, clearly and confidently: “I’ll make a decision. I’ll choose.”

Contemporary society puts a debilitating premium on physical beauty. “Beautiful women are like athletes,” opines one of the characters in Speakeasy Stage Company’s production of Neil LaBute’s new play “reasons to be pretty.” “They have a couple good years and then their knees go.” The obsession with ‘prettiness’ is the ostensible subject of this frequently electrifying production, but its real message is altogether more subtle and closer to home.
The already small stage of the Nancy and Edward Roberts Studio Theatre, where “reasons to be pretty” runs until April 2, is aggressively compressed by a concrete wall running along it horizontally. Within this setting, the play’s multiple changes between locales—including food courts, baseball fields, and other typically American surroundings—are realized through swift changes of scenery arranged by the actors themselves. The milieu is blue-collar, and a sense of suppressed dissatisfaction with the status quo, with relationships, and with the way in which people grow up pervades the entire work.
Andy Macdonald plays Greg, a 20-something manual laborer whose overheard throwaway comment about his girlfriend Steph’s (Angie Jepson) face being “regular” destroys their relationship. The play begins with the fallout from this remark, with Steph mercilessly haranguing her hapless boyfriend and his inept attempts to salvage the situation only making it worse. What for men seems inconsequential is portrayed by LaBute as the ultimate insult to women—an attack on their beauty.
Macdonald’s performance is wonderful, his gangly physique and perpetually hangdog expression exuding perennial adolescence and a reluctance to engage in adult relationships. His grasping toward some kind of maturity—in his acceptance of the hurt he has caused Steph, his desire to quit his dead-end job, and perhaps most compellingly his rejection of his best friend, the odious philanderer Kent (Burt Grinstead)—forms the narrative backbone of the play, and Macdonald pitches it perfectly. Greg is not an especially intelligent character, but he is sensitive, earnest, and ultimately redeemable. He is well-supported by the other members of the company, all of whom offer thoughtful, nuanced performances.
LaBute’s prose helps them out with its artful inarticulacies, a fractured everyday type of speech with clumsy pauses and platitudes that feel more realistic than the carefully composed dialogue of contemporaries like David Mamet.  The writing may not crackle with Mamet’s ferocity, but the characters are more fully formed and Paul Melone’s unflashy, focused production places the emphasis on individual performance. There’s some evocative use of industrial sounds and lighting, marred slightly by some unconvincing fight choreography between Greg and Kent. This hardly matters, however, because the characterization of their clashing male egos is so well established by their speech.
Nonetheless, the play lacks much of LaBute’s old bite, the bile and venomous blackness that prompted theater critic Robert Weinert-Kendt to refer to him in a Village Voice review of “Jailbait” as “American theater’s reigning misanthrope.”Publicity for “reasons to be pretty” suggests it is supposed to be a dark look at the American preoccupation with physical perfection, but is actually about the more universal theme of growing up and dealing with adulthood. As such it is distinctly less satirical and pointed than its opening 10 minutes suggest. A comparison with his earlier works—pitch black comedies “In the Company of Men” and “The Shape of Things”—reveal this to be a gentler, more contemplative work on a gentler, more contemplative theme. Whether this is a sign of increased sensitivity, or a loss of the sting that made that earlier work so memorable, remains to be seen.
Malone focuses his attention on the interplay between characters, rather than on the brief and vaguely illustrated stabs at the theme of ‘prettiness.’ This is certainly to the advantage of the drama, though it does make the occasional return to the play’s supposed theme a little incongruous. Incidents like Greg spotting Steph deliberately prettifying herself with new clothes and make-up after they have broken up feel out of place in the context of this character-driven production.
The climax is reasonably mild compared to “The Shape of Things,” which culminated in plastic surgery and complete identity crisis, but the final scene here—Greg’s adult acceptance of Steph’s happiness with another man—seems more true to life and satisfying. By focusing so completely on performance and the inner life of the characters with compressed staging and modest technical flourishes, Malone allows their individual narrative arcs to take centre-stage, rather than attempting to convey broader conceptual points. It’s unclear whether or not this was LaBute’s intention, but the staging is impeccable. On the face of it, “reasons to be pretty” represents an intriguing new phase in his development as a playwright.

A confident and dangerous Sean Parker hovers over Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin in “The Social Network.” “You don’t even know what the thing is yet,” he says. “How big it can get, how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn’t cool. You know what’s cool?” The scene jumps back to the deposition and Saverin exclaims: “A billion dollars. And that’s what shut everybody up.”
This drive to financial success and fame that leads Zuckerberg into moral ambiguity also directs the motivations of Hollywood filmmakers. Perhaps more insidiously, the prospect of great profit encourages a stifling of filmic innovation just as it silences the legitimate ethical concerns of Saverin.
Indeed, as the economy worsens, Hollywood film studios increasingly hedge their bets. This risk-aversion has caused studios to focus on three kinds of narratives: those based on real life events, previously successful franchise films, and fictional stories already popular in our collective cultural consciousness. The high costs of production for major motion pictures have always limited creative possibility in popular cinema, but this constriction of artistic possibility may be at its most severe today.
CASH AND CALIBER
A screenplay can make its way to the screen via multiple institutional paths, but most major studio films are produced with the same goals as any other financial investment. A production company and a distribution company gather the necessary capital in order to make the film with the expectation that they will at least break even. Breaking even is worthwhile in order to establish a relationship with a specific actor or director, or in an attempt to garner prestige by winning awards. Far more often, however, the decision to produce a film is profit-based. The prioritization of commercial success is so great that a distribution company generally spends an equal amount of money producing a movie and advertising it. For major studio releases, thousands of prints are generated and shipped to theaters across the country at an unimaginably high fixed costs that create intense pressure for success.
“Movie producers want to invest in something that they know is going to be profitable, and they can tell how these movies are going to do at the box office based on how the public has already received these stories,” says Daniel J. Rubin, a screenwriting lecturer in the English Department who co-wrote the popular movie “Groundhog Day.” “The less money there is floating around in Hollywood, the more this impulse takes hold.” Only when Hollywood has a lot of money, then, can it afford to lose some.
This phenomenon has clearly been evident this year. Of the 10 movies nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, seven are either based on non-fiction accounts, remakes of previously successful stories, or new installments in franchise films. Of the five films nominated for Best Director, four fall into one of these three categories. “The King’s Speech,” a retelling of events surrounding World War II, won both awards. In other artistic media, success of this nature would be unlikely; no painting or sculpture, for example, would win such significant critical acclaim without a conceptually original premise.
The practice of adapting non-fiction events into film, however, dates to the very beginning of the film industry and became especially popular in the 1920s and 1930s. According to Associate Professor Art Simon of Montclair State University, “[During this period] producers at Warner Brothers would actually comb the newspapers regularly looking for events to adapt to the screen.” Of course, expectations for film during this period were entirely different. In an era before television, the only medium people could use to have the news to play out directly in front of them was film.
As Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) Professor Alfred Guzzetti explains, “Fewer movies are being produced now, and fewer movies are being released ... the cost of creating and releasing a movie has really, really gone up even in absolute dollars. It’s a much riskier enterprise.” When a studio produces many low-budget movies annually, it can afford to absorb the losses of a flop, but when a studio is producing few high-budget movies, the studio cannot afford these costs. This trend could potentially prove permanent as low-cost new media formats compete with films for the attention of audiences.
'THE CHILD’S PART'
Considering most moviegoers can intuit how film narratives will resolve themselves, it may not be intrigue that draws them to the theater; it may rather be the dependability provided by a narrow set of possible storylines. There is an important difference between stories with predictable outcomes and those with popularly known outcomes. In the case of “Black Swan,” an audience member can fairly accurately predict the outcome from the composition of characters, but there is still an element of suspense. However, in “The King’s Speech” the ending is already known by every audience member before he or she ever sees the film—Britain will win World War II and King George VI will find a way around his stutter.
“Films are projected in order not to require too much interpretive labor or comparative study of variation in the manner of myth and folklore,” VES Professor Tom Conley wrote via email. “Something of the child’s part is in these films for the reason [that] enjoyment comes from repetition: as children we want to hear stories over and again, no matter how their narrative might turn out.” Works of art are generally praised for originality, which by its very nature challenges the viewer. Moviegoers, instead, seem to value something else in film: the tranquility of seeing expected, logical resolutions play out in the world before you, as they so rarely do in real life.
This brand of predictability extends beyond plot arc. “Many moviegoers didn’t see ‘True Grit’ because they remember the 1969 John Wayne version,” Simon says. “Instead, many people went to see the movie because they were fans of the Coen brothers and it was merely a case of personalities.”
AUDIENCE ATTRACTION
As such, film producers do not always assume that a film’s financial success will be based on the popular attention surrounding real-life events or the success of a prior version of the same story. They also look toward projects involving celebrity directors or actors who have previously churned out large sums of money. Even in the recession, producers have been willing to bankroll movies such as “Black Swan”—directed by Darren S. Aronofsky ’91 and starring Natalie Portman ’03—and “Inception”—directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Leonardo DiCaprio—because of the trust they have in the ability of these actors and directors to attract audiences to the theater.
Depending on personalities, however, has not proven to be a surefire formula for movie producers. Guzzetti specifically cites the example of director Michael Cimino, whose 1978 film “The Deer Hunter” earned millions of dollars at the box office and five Academy Awards. This showing motivated producers at United Artists in 1980 to offer Cimino what Guzzetti described as a “carte blanche” to direct “Heaven’s Gate.” The movie was a critical and commercial flop of historic proportions, and it helped to bankrupt United Artists. “Many people look at that and think: how can we keep that from happening?” Guzzetti says. “Deal with known quantities—buy a book, deal with a director who has always made money like James Cameron, have something that’s more predictable.”
Cimino’s failure, then, demonstrates that celebrity culture is a fickle assurance in attaining financial success. The most reliable formula for making a profit in the film industry may lie in retelling a popular tale.
CINEMA OF THE SPECTACLE
Unlike conventional material products, a film’s performance is dependent on its critical reception and marketing figures such as its initial box office sales. Most commercial products, such as cigarettes, are not highly dependent on these factors. For a given brand of cigarettes, financial success isn’t determined by sales during its first week of distribution or reviews in popular literature. A film’s success, on the other hand, is subject to these external factors. “It’s like a sport,” Guzzetti says. “People root for movies. Audience members not only follow whether a movie is good, but how the movie is doing. People identify with the business end of movies ... in a way they never did in classical Hollywood.”
In other words, the film industry represents much more to culture than the sum of the products that it produces—it is a spectacle in which fans become personally attached to the commercial and critical reception of particular shows. This is why the Academy Awards is regularly one of the most widely watched annual television events: people not only enjoy watching the content of a movie, but the commercial route that the movie itself takes from the beginning of development to the end of distribution. The possibilities for profit in a well-liked movie are therefore magnified by a surrounding consumer culture that increases the gap between success and failure. The risk for a flop becomes untenable.
BRAND ABILITY
Documentaries might seem immune to the hackneyed plotlines and characters that constitute so many popular movies—in order for a documentary to exist, it must be making an original argument. The pressures of Hollywood, however, have infected the genre with many of the symptoms of the economic squeeze that have plagued studio films. This change proves the extent to which the Hollywood studio system is limiting the creative and argumentative possibilities of major films in wholly new ways. Simon believes there has been an increase of so-called “branded” documentaries. “After filmmakers such as Michael Moore demonstrated that they could draw crowds to the box office,” Simon says, “movie producers began to think about the profitability of documentary films and began to finance large projects such as ‘Fahrenheit 9/11’ and ‘An Inconvenient Truth.’”
These large budgets have allowed documentaries to experiment with filmmaking techniques previously reserved for Hollywood studio films, including polished visuals, special effects, and original soundtracks, all of which make widely-distributed documentary films in line technically with studio pictures. This trend has been especially apparent in documentaries of the last year such as “Inside Job” and “Waiting for ‘Superman,’” which have used enormous budgets by documentary standards in order to create a Hollywood feel.
This overdone approach to documentary filmmaking has increasingly taken what used to be an observational account of event and increasingly inserted the voice of the director. Celebrity culture within documentary filmmaking may allow people to come to anticipate the content of a documentary in advance, just as Conley suggested they do with studio pictures. “You know what you’re going to find in a Michael Moore documentary before you even get there,” Simon says. “In fact, the reason you’re probably even going is because you agree with his political viewpoints.” In the modern economic reality of popular cinema, the standard issue has a growing dominance.

At a 2003 assembly of the Afghan national assembly, then-25-year old Afghan parliamentarian Malalai Joya said, “Warlords [are] responsible for our country’s situation. Afghanistan is the center for national and international conflicts. They oppress women and have ruined our country. They should be prosecuted. They may be forgiven by the Afghan people but not by history!” In response, the assembly chairman Sebaghatullah Mojeddidi tried to expel her from the body.
Joya was denied a travel visa to the U.S. on Wednesday and will be unable to make her scheduled appearances at several colleges, including Harvard. She was scheduled to speak alongside Noam Chomsky at the Mar. 25 event, “The Case for Withdrawal from Afghanistan,” sponsored by a coalition of organizations, including Haymarket Books, the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, Harvard College Human Rights Advocates, and the International Socialist Organization.
After her brush with the Afghan parliament elders, Joya became a public advocate for Afghan women’s rights, traveling across Europe and the U.S. to publicize the problems faced by her fellow citizens. In an interview with PBS, she described that, in Afghanistan “women are seen as second degree citizens and the fundamentalist preach day and night that ‘woman should be in her house or in the grave,’ but as a woman I challenge the most powerful people in the country who only speak in the language of guns, and my voice is echoed and welcomed by the gross majority of my people.”
But nowadays her public appearances are dedicated to promoting the removal of U.S. and NATO troops from Afghanistan, and we hope this is not what got her into trouble with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In her most recent book, the promotion of which was to be the overarching subject of her America tour, she writes that the U.S. and NATO have constructed a benign image of the war in Afghanistan that has no bearing on reality, and that the Western media is complicit in this construction. In 2010, she gave an interview to Uprising Radio, saying, “I will never compromise with the US And NATO who have occupied my country, empowered the most bloody enemies of my people and are killing my innocent compatriots…in Afghanistan.” The anti-war nature of her tour should not influence her visa application. 
There is a difficult process for getting a visa, and no one can bypass these rules, no matter how deserving or well known. Additionally, a person whose presence in America would cause a direct threat to residents may be justly refused a visa. However, Joya's camp claims she was refused a visa because she lives "underground" and is "unemployed,”—and these reasons are suspect. It seems unlikely that, as such a high-profile figure, Joya will purposely overstay her visa or otherwise abuse her terms of visitation in this country. Moreover, as the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Joya came to the U.S. without trouble last year, and other countries such as the U.K., Canada, and France, have granted her permission to tour within their borders.
 
We are opposed to ideological exclusion and if, upon further investigation, this proves to be the case with Afghan women's rights activist Malalai Joya, then University leaders should step in and support her efforts to enter the U.S. Joya's message of humanitarianism and women's rights is an important one that we should support. We praise the nine Congressional representatives who have asked the Consul General to reconsider her visa application as well as the student groups who are to rally Wednesday on her behalf of her cause. We hope that in this process a fuller articulation of why Joya's visa was denied comes to light.

Japan’s nuclear disaster has sobered the world. What’s more is that in the age of globalization, Japan’s tragedy has morphed into a global crisis—international markets have tanked and some of Japan’s radiation has spilled into California and China.
According to the International Energy Agency, over 31 countries currently operate a total of 440 nuclear power plants. The number is likely to exceed 800 by 2025. Therefore, in the aftermath of the Fukushima plant’s very pubic display of the dangers of nuclear power, all countries must reflect on their ambitions for nuclear power.
As seen from the Japanese example, a future nuclear disaster in one country can have an adverse effect on all countries. Facing similar challenges regarding nuclear energy, the international community must work together to establish tighter nuclear protocols and standards. Internationally, the Fukushima plant disaster has provoked sharp criticism of nuclear power as a viable energy source. But regardless of criticisms, the reality is that nuclear power is here to stay.
Many developing countries have no choice but to continue with their nuclear plans. China and India alone have plans to build over 200 plants over the next 20 years. There simply isn’t enough fossil fuel-based energy or cheap renewable alternatives to fuel their energy-hungry economies. In an effort to uplift hundreds of millions of their citizens from poverty, their choice to pursue abundant nuclear power, despite its risks, may be well justified. At least in the medium term, developed countries like the U.S.—with a 20 percent dependency on nuclear power—can’t simply shut off existing plants or completely rule out the establishment of future plants.
Given the inevitable growth of nuclear power and the fact that the futures of all open economies are intertwined, it makes sense for countries to work together to establish tighter nuclear standards. The U.S. should seize this moment to lead a necessary global effort to ensure the safety of our own existing plants and the safety and sustainability of new plants in emerging economies.
To begin this effort, a team of independent, international scientists must first review existing reactor designs. Concerns about fundamental design flaws of the General Electric reactor in the Fukushima plant have been in existence for several years. There are 90 such reactors in plants around the globe—an unbiased review of GE and other vendors’ designs is clearly mandated.
Furthermore, new guidelines for suitability of nuclear sites must be drawn out to minimize the vulnerability of plants to potential catastrophic natural disasters.  Currently there are substantial plans for new nuclear power plants in natural disaster prone countries like Indonesia, which lie on the Ring of Fire. In light of the Japanese tragedy, such plans must be critically reviewed.
Nuclear emergency plans must also be established for all countries. Japan has the world’s third-largest economy and has highly sophisticated technology. Yet its impromptu efforts to deal with this crisis appear to be desperate. It’s scary to think about the level of potential inadequacy with which developing countries like India or Indonesia, that lack the necessary sophistication, experience, and infrastructure, would deal with a similar nuclear crisis. Even in the U.S., a Hurricane Katrina-type response to a nuclear accident could be equally disastrous. Disaster readiness everywhere must subsequently be improved.
Since the Chernobyl disaster fell from the headlines over two decades ago the world has dangerously assumed that we have a mastery of nuclear power. The Japan crisis clearly shows that we do not.
Given the inevitability of many more nuclear plants to come, the U.S. must lead an international effort to substantially increase the safety of nuclear power plants. If the world seriously collaborates on such an effort, Japan’s nuclear crisis will at least have served the purpose of avoiding future tragedies.

Because a Republican House of Representatives hell-bent on dismantling the safety net apparently wasn’t enough to worry about, liberals wonks have decided to freak out about robots.
In a column a few weeks ago, The New York Times’ Paul Krugman noted that technological progress won’t just threaten manufacturing jobs and other low-skill labor, but white collar jobs as well. Lawyers, for example, are less in demand as artificial intelligence has enabled software to sift through legal documents at a rate humans could only dream of. Radiologists could see themselves put out of work by software capable of analyzing medical scans.
This seems like a scary prospect at first, not least to the demographic of people who read Krugman (or The Crimson, for that matter). But it needn’t be. For one thing, technological progress allows less boring, repetitive work to be done by humans. As Krugman notes, computers are good at work that involves following explicit rules. That means the sort of menial paper pushing that law firm associates complain about, as well as menial assembly line jobs. Computers aren’t good at all boring tasks; Roomba vacuums aside, housekeeping isn’t going to be done by robots any time soon. But the change favors interesting work.
More fundamentally, talk about “losing jobs” to robots is overly simplistic. Technological progress requires humans to do less work, but it does not require fewer human workers. The same number of workers could just do less work per person. Robots could increase leisure, not unemployment.
This has long been a utopian dream of the left. As Chris Bertram noted in a response to Krugman, the late Marxist political philosopher G. A. Cohen argued for a form of socialism in which the population spent less time creating wealth and more time pursuing other interests. John Maynard Keynes, as well, believed that once basic human material needs are met, pressure for economic growth should slow and people should spend more time living for living’s sake. Technological progress could, in some respects, eliminate the dichotomy between leisure and economic growth Cohen and Keynes presuppose. It could allow us to leave the job of economic growth to the robots and let the rest of us enjoy its fruits.
As pleasing as this future is to imagine, it’s still a ways off. While the developing world’s extraordinary economic growth suggests that a world free of poverty could emerge before the century is out, we’re not there yet. More to the point, while technological progress could enable such abundance with less human effort, humans’ basic material needs won’t necessarily be met once that level of abundance is reached. If technological progress leads to economic growth that’s concentrated in the hands of a few, then the rest of us will just be left with less work for less pay.
In that respect, we should tackle a future economy where technological progress has rendered obsolete numerous kinds of human work the same way we should tackle the current economy, by using tax policy and social programs to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources.
However, some new policies should be pursued as well. Currently, the link between a high employment level and human wellbeing is pretty strong. Work is generally necessary for humans to attain basic goods necessary for survival, and work in developed countries, in particular, allows higher levels of consumption that can enable poor countries to pursue export-based growth.
But if technological progress allows economic growth to continue with less human effort, the link between employment and wellbeing becomes weaker. If economic growth and consumption can grow in developed countries even as hours worked fall, then developed country employment is less needed as a means of pulling developing countries out of poverty. Residents of rich countries could make enough to live comfortably while working less.
The word “could” is important there. While desirable, this shift toward leisure is not inevitable. Luckily, we have some idea of what policies can enable such a shift. Workers in European countries currently enjoy much more leisure time than those in America, and most economists agree that this is due to government interventions.
To be sure, there is disagreement on which interventions are responsible. The Nobel Laureate Edward C. Prescott credits Europe’s greater leisure to its higher taxes on labor income, while Harvard professors Albert F. Alesina and Edward L. Glaeser and Dartmouth professor Bruce I. Sacerdote believe the difference is due to Europe’s labor market regulations. Either way, the point stands that policy changes can allow a shift away from work toward leisure.
Technological progress’ displacement of human labor, then, need not be a catastrophe. Instead, it could lead to a society where economic pursuits are less central to human lives. To quote Keynes, “It will be those peoples, who can keep alive, and cultivate into a fuller perfection, the art of life itself and do not sell themselves for the means of life, who will be able to enjoy the abundance when it comes.”

Love it or hate it, we must deal with it: Teach For America is often at the forefront of our minds, media, conversations, and debates. For instance, Harvard students each year apply in droves to TFA, the organization that sends recent college graduates (known as corps members) to teach in some of the nation’s poorest communities. Outside of the Institute of Politics on Feb. 24, Harvard students protested the proposed budget cuts that would slash funding to AmeriCorps—the TFA parent organization—at a speech given by House Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor. The organization’s 20-year anniversary on Feb. 12 generated a wave of articles proclaiming its success. But there is no shortage of those who condemn its shortcomings. We just can’t get TFA out of our heads.
TFA may generate more criticism than any other post-graduation plan—whether that be a fellowship, graduate school, or a finance or consulting job. But TFA does not deserve nearly as much flack at it gets from these conscientious objectors. Despite its flaws, TFA is an overall positive force in American elementary and secondary education.
As TIME.com columnist Andrew J. Rotherham points out, the best quality research shows that TFA produces, on the whole, corps members that are as good or better than other teachers, and it is becoming steadily more effective at doing so. Others have argued that the education entrepreneurs that TFA counts among its alumni justify the corps’ existence at all. These alumni include former District of Columbia Public Schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the founders of the KIPP charter schools, Mike Feinberg and David Levin.
So why is TFA always in purgatory? People argue that TFA is merely a launching pad for graduate school; they lament that it’s too short of a commitment to teaching; they say the corps members are ill-prepared for the incredibly difficult task of teaching in some of America’s poorest communities.
I asked Wendy S. Kopp about these criticisms. Kopp—the founder of Teach for America, whose senior thesis at Princeton was a proposal for the corps—spoke at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on Feb. 4. I asked her: How do I defend TFA? She responded that America needs people working in all sectors to close the achievement gap. Teachers are important, but so are, for example, policymakers and education lawyers. Through TFA, individuals who plan for careers outside of teaching become more invested in education.
These are all valid points. To me, however, one of the most valuable aspects of TFA is something simpler: It shakes things up. It’s not perfect, and many criticisms of the program are well founded. But TFA has been an important part of an attitude adjustment toward America’s failing education system. It has incubated education leaders, and it has fostered entrenched interest in fixing American public schools.
It does so by offering a supply of young, enthusiastic teachers who are not unionized. It makes teaching an attractive job option immediately post-graduation. It gets people involved, and most stay involved; according to Rotherham, 52 percent of TFA alumni continue to teach after their two-year commitment, and 67 percent work in the education sector. Does TFA have its flaws? Sure. Nonetheless, it helps creates the urgency needed to close the achievement gap.
So, TFA does deserve the funding it gets from the government through AmeriCorps. It deserves the support it gets from various media outlets. And it deserves your support. By generating dialogue, by bringing the urgency of the achievement gap to college campuses, by increasing the number of non-unionized teachers working in the school system, it’s making people angry: policymakers, teachers, reformers, and whoever else decides to join the conversation. And the time is always right. When more people are debating these issues, things will change. Without TFA, education would play a diminished role in many college-aged students’ psyches. But changing and fixing the American education system must be ever-present our minds.
While TFA celebrated its 20th anniversary in Washington last month, students in the District of Columbia were still struggling to read, write, and perform arithmetic. In 2007, eight percent of public school students in our nation’s capital could do math at grade level. What matters most, certainly beyond the minutiae of the TFA debate, is that the status quo isn’t working. TFA will not fix the problem by itself, but neither will the current educational paradigm. For me, one of TFA’s most important roles is to draw attention to America’s schools. In that way, it just may move the needle.

In January, Kelley Williams-Bolar served nine days in jail for trying to get her kids a better education — or at least that’s what mainstream coverage of the story would have you believe. National Public Radio’s Kyle Olson christened Williams-Bolar the Rosa Parks of education, and Teach For America’s Kevin Huffman jumped on the bandwagon with a sanctimonious op-ed in The Washington Post. Of course, Williams-Bolar also committed a few felonies along the way—falsifying documents and lying about her address so that her children could attend schools in a different district. The punishment of jail time may have been disproportionate to the crime, but the popular support for Williams-Bolar’s cause reveals a fundamental problem with how Americans think about educational inequality.
For some, Williams-Bolar’s case demonstrates basic inequities in what Nancy Flanagan of Education Week has described as America’s “economically segregated” school system. Williams-Bolar was simply attempting to overcome this system, which is at its worst in districts like Akron, Ohio, where she lives. Sixty-nine percent of Akron students receive free or reduced-price lunch; the three schools in Williams-Bolar’s zone received the second-lowest ranking (“Academic Watch”) on Ohio’s six-point scale used to evaluate its schools. The Akron schools stood in sharp contrast to the neighboring Copley-Fairlawn district, where Williams-Bolar sent her children. Here, low poverty rates (16 percent FRPL) and high test scores enabled the district to attain Ohio’s top rating, “Excellent with Distinction.”
The existence of gaping inequities in neighboring districts is viscerally disturbing, and this explains why part of the response to Williams-Bolar’s case has been to call for greater use of “interdistrict plans.” Under these plans, states would pay for underperforming urban students to be transported to excellent suburban districts. For example, Jennifer Holmes and Amy Wells have studied eight cities that successfully undertook such plans, and blogger Halley Potter reports that interdistricting greatly increases diversity in suburban schools. Moreover, “students who won a lottery and became transfer participants scored higher than those who lost in the lottery.”
Which is exactly the problem.
Those who advocate for school choice extol its ability to ensure racial and socioeconomic diversity while reducing egregious disparities between schools separated by only a few miles. School choice would undoubtedly do both of these things, but that doesn’t make it the solution to underperforming schools—especially because choices would, in effect, have to be limited. School choice can’t be treated as the “free market” solution to education, in which parents would have unlimited control over where to send their children regardless of district boundaries; otherwise, students would flood out of underperforming urban schools and flock to their excelling suburban neighbors.
So school districts have come up with practices like lotteries and interdistricting plans that either distribute spots in better schools by chance or specifically allot them to the lowest-performing students. Last year’s documentary “Waiting for Superman” evocatively demonstrated the flaws of the first system, in which students’ life chances are literally lotteried off while tearful parents and children stand by helplessly. Allocating the spots to low-income or underperforming children avoids the lottery problem, but it creates a new one: It leaves our highest performing students in poor districts where their skills can’t be nurtured. American K-12 education fails its best students just as egregiously as it fails its worst, and the National Research Council has reported that “performance of the top 5 percent of U.S. students is matched by the top 50 percent of students in Japan.” Other international comparisons are equally disheartening—which is partly why we see an increasing proportion of foreign-born students attending our top universities. Like all American students, our highest performers deserve the best education we can provide, and some interdistricting plans condemn them to the worst.
Overall, the effect of interdistricting plans would be to cover up current underperformance by distributing low-performing students more equally; instead of being concentrated in poor urban areas, they’d now also be found in wealthier suburban schools, while test scores in urban districts left with their best students would seem higher on average. But moving students around—switching them from school to school in the hope that one will stick—isn’t the solution. Instead of providing urban students with a way out of underperforming districts, we need to improve the quality of urban education itself.
Indeed, we need to refocus the national education debate by choosing to raise performance instead of decrease inequality. We can choose either to lower the standards of great schools just as we raise the standards of poor ones, or we can simply work to bring our lowest-performing districts up to the level of their high-achieving neighbors.
I am a proponent of school choice, and parents should have as many options as possible in choosing where to send their children. But we can’t pretend that school choice is the solution to our education crisis when it’s only a solution to inequality. If we want to improve student performance, we need to look at teacher quality, at curriculum standards, and at socioeconomic conditions. If we’re focusing on school choice, we’re aiming at the wrong target.

In a continually-ailing job market, more Harvard Law School third year students applied to judicial clerkships this past fall, according to the Harvard Law School Office of Career Services.
Associate Director for Judicial Clerkships Kirsten K. Solberg attributed the increase in clerkship applications to a tougher job market, which likely prompted students to apply to many different positions to ensure employment post-graduation.
“Clerkships are continuing to grow as a nice alternative,” she said.
Solberg said that there was a more dramatic increase in clerkship applications when the economy crashed in 2008, but in the following years the application rate has continued to increase in smaller increments.
Still, she added that she thought the current popularity of clerkships was tied to the changing likelihood of obtaining law firm positions.
“I think if law firms jump back up to their hiring practices before 2008, we would see a decline in clerkship applications,” Solberg said.
While the weakened economy has affected the ability of students at other law schools to obtain employment, Harvard Law students have been largely been unaffected.
“The percentage of Harvard Law School graduates [with jobs at graduation] varies in small numbers in the boom years compared to the worst job market years,” Solberg said.
“For most Harvard students, the difference in the job market means not as many offers to chose from.”
Rachel E. Mehlsak, a third year at the Law School, will clerk next year for Maine Supreme Judicial Court Justice Jon D. Levy as “a nice way of transitioning into practice later on.”
Mehlsak said that she applied to work for over 100 judges, including judges that sit on state supreme courts, federal appeals courts, and federal district courts.
According to Solberg, applying to about 80 clerkship positions is normal for students interested in clerking—some students apply to more, some apply to fewer.
Soblerg said that the rate of students that are accepted to clerkships would be a meaningless statistic because students who could probably get a clerkship somewhere in the country sometimes apply to a very narrow pool of judges based on personal preferences or the cities where the judges are based.
“Most Harvard applicants who want a clerkship could get a clerkship—it’s a matter of how broadly or narrowly they want to apply,” Soblerg said.
Mehlsak said that most of her friends who applied for clerkships were given positions.
“I have a lot of friends who applied,” Mehlsak said, “and I would say maybe half to the majority were accepted.”

The Cambridge City Council weighed in last night on the federal budget, passing a resolution urging President Barack Obama to maintain funding for the Community Services Block Grant—the primary funding source for community action programs.
The Community Action Program was established as part of the 1964 Economic Opportunities Act and is administered by local non-profits across the country.
These organizations provide a variety of social services such as after-school programs, heating assistance, personal advocacy, and access to public benefits.
According to Irvieene Goldson, the chair of Cambridge’s local community action agency, the Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee (CEOC), over 50 percent of the agency’s budget will be eliminated if Congress passes the spending reductions recommended by the Obama Administration.
A group of close to 20 agency staff members, clients, and supporters spoke during the City Council’s public comment period.
CEOC board members said that thousands of Cambridge residents utilize the agency’s food pantry every month.
“How can we close the door on the mouths of hungry people, who are our neighbors, family, friends, or members of the community,” board member Yoko Hershiki said.
“This is not the spirit of Cambridge.”
City Councilor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 praised CEOC’s advocacy for tenants’ rights.
He credited their work with halting a local landlord from entering into residents’ apartments unannounced and permitting construction workers to use the tenants’ restrooms.
CEOC also provides services related to income tax preparation, family planning services, public benefit advocacy, financial literacy, and pre-school child care.
“Say no to the cuts, it’s the wrong direction and we just need to stop it,” said CEOC Executive Director Elaine DeRosa.
She said the budget cuts will have little impact on reducing the national deficit, while harming those struggling economically.
Mayor David P. Maher brought forth the policy resolution, which passed unanimously.

Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt will be opening at 1380 Mass. Ave—the long-vacant former location of Alpha Omega Jewelers—on Friday, April 8.
The Pinkberry corporation decided to look for a location in Harvard Square after it began its expansion to New England, according to CEO Ron Graves.
Trippe J. Lonian, the Pinkberry area developer for New England, is a resident of Cambridge and used to live in Harvard Square.
“I understand how important and historic that corner is,” Lonian said. “It’s great from an energy standpoint. It’s truly unique, and it’s always been a melting pot of people.”
Pinkberry—already a member of the Harvard Square Business Association—plans to become a part of the Harvard Square community by hosting and participating in local events and partnering with other local businesses, according to Graves.
Lonian said that the company is looking forward to being a part of the Square community.
“Our concept appeals to a lot of people. We like being near colleges, but we also like being near businesses,” Lonian said.
The chain’s yogurt appeals to a variety of customers by allowing them to personalize every order with over 30 toppings and six yogurt flavors, according to Graves.
Pinkberry opened its first New England location in Hingham, Mass., in August. Another location opened at 288 Newbury St. in Boston in November.
The Harvard Square location will be the first Pinkberry in the region to be open for breakfast. The shop will open at 9 a.m. daily, as opposed to 11 a.m. at other locations.
Breakfast options include the Pinkberry fruit parfait—which includes granola and five layers of fruit topped with original yogurt—as well as the Pinkberry fruit bowl and freshly-blended smoothies.
“We’re excited about the opportunity to offer a different breakfast option for students. Our neighbors, Starbucks and Au Bon Pain, seem to be pretty busy in the morning, and we’re interested in becoming a part of that,” Lonian said.
The Harvard Square location will be open until 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and until midnight on Friday and Saturday.
The design of the location will be standard to Pinkberry stores in the U.S.
“The design is contemporary, crisp, and creates a lively, energetic atmosphere,” Graves wrote in an email.
Graves is not concerned with competition from other local yogurt shops, such as the locally-owned and -operated Berryline.
“Pinkberry is the original. We are our own brand, and there is no product, nor experience like it,” Graves wrote.
The former Alpha Omega Jewelers location has been divided to include Pinkberry and a new Starbucks location, with Pinkberry on the left.

Surgeons at Brigham and Women’s Hospital successfully performed the first full face transplant in the United States last week, the hospital announced yesterday.
In the 15-hour surgery, surgeons attached a donor’s face, replacing tissue from “hairline to Adam’s apple,” according to lead surgeon Bohdan Pomahac, an assistant professor of surgery at the Brigham. The surgery was the second face transplant procedure at the Brigham—the first was a partial face transplant in 2009—and the second full face transplant in the world.
The patient, 25-year-old Dallas Weins of Fort Worth, Texas, suffered severe burns in an electrical accident in November 2008 that left him without a nose, lips, eyes, or eyebrows. Prior to last week’s procedure, Wiens had undergone 22 surgeries to repair damage to his face.
Pomahac said that Wiens has been stable since the procedure and does not need to be in an intensive care unit. He added that Wiens’ new face is paralyzed “like a stroke patient’s,” and that it will take about three months for him to be able to move and feel it. Wiens is expected to make a full recovery.
Weins’ new face is not expected to fully resemble “either what he used to be or the donor,” Pomahac told the Associated Press.
“Overall, [the surgery] was a resounding success,” he said.
Pomahac stressed the complexity of the procedure, which he described as unique.
Unlike the transplantations of a kidney—which only requires the correct placement of a vein, an artery, and the ureter—face transplants also require the reconnection of the facial nerves.
“There were about a dozen structures that needed to be found and re-connected,” he said. “How do you find the nerves and re-connect them so that one day you can move the face and feel it?”
Wiens’ surgery was paid for by a $3.4 million grant from the Defense Department to fund transplant research.
According to Pomahac, two other patients are currently on the waiting list for face transplants at Brigham and Women’s. The AP reported that one of the patients is Charla Nash, who was disfigured by a chimpanzee in 2009.
Looking forward, Pomahac said his team is currently working on techniques for transplanting hands and lower extremities.
Brigham and Women’s Hospital was the site of the first successful human organ transplant—a kidney—in 1954.

Irene S. Davis, an expert on the biomechanics of barefoot running, will join the faculty of Harvard Medical School as a member of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Spaulding Rehabilitation Network.
She will head the new Spaulding National Running Center, devoted to both preventing and treating running-related injuries.
Davis, herself an advocate for and practitioner of barefoot running, will leave her post at the University of Delaware this spring.
“I’ve always really wanted to develop a national center of excellence for the rehabilitation and treatment of running injuries,” Davis said.
“Boston being a mecca for medicine, science, and running, it seemed like the right place.”
Davis said the center will be comprised of a clinic and biomechanics laboratory.
Davis also said she will participate in the Harvard On The Move initiative by offering lectures and demonstrations on barefoot running.
“Her expertise will not only serve to enrich the spectrum of care we can offer, but will be a great resource to the dynamic running community that exists in our region,” Ross D. Zafonte, Head of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, said in a statement released last week.
Davis has previously collaborated with Harvard professors on research.
“I think what’s phenomenal about Irene is that she combines a really solid research perspective on the mechanics of running with practical knowledge from the physical training side,” said Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, Harvard professor of human evolutionary biology, who collaborated with Davis on research his lab conducted on barefoot versus shod running.
Their research team found that barefoot runners have a significantly different “strike,” or landing stroke, from shod runners.
They showed that barefoot runners tend to spread landing force more evenly over time because they land toward the middle of their feet.
In contrast, shod runners experience a large and potentially damaging spike of landing force because they land on their heels. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature in January 2010.
Lieberman said he and Davis have already planned further collaborative research, which he said will be aided by the fact that she will now be “just a few blocks from the lab.”

Raymond Clark III pled guilty this past Thursday to the murder and attempted sexual assault of Annie Le, a Yale graduate student who was found dead in a campus research building over 18 months ago.
According to the Yale Daily News, Clark previously pled not guilty at a January 2010 court hearing, but in light of the extensive DNA and physical evidence against him, Clark decided to strike a plea bargain with the prosecution.
He is likely to receive a 44-year prison sentence, according to the YDN.
Le, a 24-year-old doctoral student, was reported missing on Sept. 8, 2009, just five days before she was to be married. Her body was found five days later stuffed in a cavity of a research building basement.
A trail of evidence led authorities to Clark, an animal technician who worked in the same building as Le. Among the evidence compiled by police investigations was Clark’s pen, which was found underneath Le’s body. The ink was matched to the ink from the pen that Clark had used to sign in to work on the morning of Sept. 8, and the DNA on the cap matched Clark’s. He was arrested on Sept. 17, just nine days after Le was originally reported missing.
Clark will receive his final sentence at a court date tentatively scheduled for May 20. While there has been discussion as to whether or not a 44-year sentence is too lenient, according to the YDN the University “expressed relief” that the case would not be going to trial, saving Annie Le’s family from further pain that a trial might have caused.

When Harvard Law School Professor William J. Stuntz laughed, he howled. His entire body—a small frame, smaller even when in his last years when he battled cancer—convulsed.
“I do miss his laugh,” said David A. Skeel, a University of Pennsylvania law professor and former student of Stuntz’s. “There was just a joy in it. He took great pleasure in laughing.”
After a three-year battle with stage-four colon cancer, Stuntz died in his home in Belmont, Mass., on March 15. He was 52 years old.
For three decades, Stuntz studied and taught criminal justice and procedure. Throughout his career, he asserted that the United States imprisons too many of its citizens—especially the poor and minorities—and discussed the appropriate role of faith and mercy in the justice and penal systems.
After teaching at the University of Virginia Law School, his alma mater, Stuntz came to teach at HLS in 1999.
Born in Washington on July 3, 1958, Stuntz grew up in Annapolis, Md. He graduated from the College of William and Mary, and following law school, he clerked for Associate Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.
An evangelical Christian, Stuntz established for himself a unique niche at HLS as a religious leader and top legal scholar.
His colleagues remember him for always bringing fresh ideas to the table, on subjects ranging from war to religion.
“There is a small number of public intellectuals in our historical moment who can see things in a fresh and counterintuitive way, and Bill was one of them,” Skeel said.
Skeel said that after watching Stuntz maneuver through 10 years of chronic pain and disease with “astonishing grace,” he will remember Stuntz for his humble nature.
He recalled a night on campus that epitomized Stuntz’s selflessness.
“We crossed paths with the night janitor, and Bill knew exactly who he was, stopped, addressed the janitor by name, and talked about their families and [their health],” Skeel said.
“Bill for me didn’t just treat colleagues as if they were special—he treated everyone like they were special,” Skeel added.
Katheryn E. Klimko, a third year student at the Law School and member of the Harvard Law School Christian Fellowship, met Stuntz at Park Street Church, which they both attended, and later took two of his classes. She would form a close relationship with the professor, who advised her while she was writing a paper on the Eighth Amendment.
She said that when she remembers Stuntz, she pictures him mid-laugh.
“He was an extremely joyful person, which must have been so difficult with what he was dealing with,” she said.
Klimko said that Stuntz never showed his pain while he was teaching, instead making students laugh and occasionally rewarding a good point with what his students knew was his highest compliment—a pause, and then a slow, “Yeah. That’s nice.”
Klimko said Stuntz made himself available to his students even through his treatment—welcoming them into his office, where he worked with the lights out and amidst stacks of papers.
J. Mark Ramseyer, a Law School professor who started at HLS roughly the same time as Stuntz, said that teaching and helping students was Stuntz’s own kind of medicine.
“Having to prepare for class and having the opportunity to work with students helped him deal with the pain,” Ramseyer said. “He responded by focusing on other people.”
Klimko said the cultural diversity at Stuntz’s religious funeral was indicative of his accepting and tolerant understanding of Christianity.
“My dad went out of his way to build relationships with other world views and listen to them with an open mind,” said Stuntz’s son Samuel D. Stuntz ’10.
“He was a combination of being wonderfully helpful—selflessly helpful—and always being modest about it,” Ramseyer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a prelude to the robbery in Kirkland House that ended in Justin Cosby’s death, alleged gunman Jabrai Jordan Copney and his alleged accomplice Blayn Jiggetts are said to have stolen a large quantity of marijuana from two Yale undergraduates in 2008, according to court documents.
Copney allegedly told Jules E. Bolton, a 2009 Yale graduate, that he would pay $14,000 for three pounds of marijuana; instead, Copney robbed Bolton and his friend at gunpoint, taking the marijuana and their IDs, Bolton told investigators.
According to a memorandum filed by the Middlesex District Attorney’s office, Jiggetts said that the incident in New York served as a blueprint for the robbery in Kirkland’s J-entryway on May 18, 2009.
That day, Copney allegedly shot Cosby, a Cambridge Rindge and Latin graduate who did not attend Harvard, during what investigators have called a failed “drug rip.”
Chanequa N. Campbell, a Harvard senior at the time, and Jason Aquino, another alleged accomplice who plans to plead guilty to manslaughter Thursday for his role in the shooting, both told investigators that the robbery of the Yale students served as a model for the plan to rob Cosby.
Prosecutors described this alleged robbery in a memorandum that responds to a motion filed by Brittany J. Smith, who is being charged with misleading a grand jury. The motion filed by Smith asked prosecutors to drop charges against her due to a non-prosecution agreement.
In their memorandum, prosecutors say that the agreement with Smith should be nullified in part because she did not disclose that she was aware of the robbery of the two Yale students. Because of this, prosecutors say, she violated an agreement to cooperate with investigators, a claim that her defense attorney strongly disputes.
ANOTHER DRUG RIP
Bolton told an investigator in Sept. 2009 that he and Yale classmate Alexander T. King met with Copney in Brittany J. Smith’s Lowell House dorm room during the weekend of the Harvard-Yale football game in 2008, according to the memorandum.
Smith was Copney’s girlfriend at the time of the Kirkland shooting and has been charged as an accessory to the murder.
Campbell told investigators that she was friends with King before that 2008 meeting.
Bolton said that in Nov. 2008, Copney told Bolton that he planned to return to New York, where he, Jiggetts, and Aquino are from. According to the document, the two finalized the details of the drug deal and planned to meet at a Starbucks near Grand Central Station in New York City.
The District Attorney’s Office wrote that prior to their New York meeting, Copney told Bolton that he would give him $14,000 for three pounds of marijuana, according to court documents.
Bolton, prosecutors said, told investigators that it was an unusual deal for him because most of his past deals were smaller and were done in his dorm room at Yale with people he knew.
Copney was about 45 minutes late to their meeting, which Bolton told investigators unnerved both him and King.
When he arrived, Copney claimed that he had left some of the money at his home, according to court documents.
The three men then took a taxi to a Harlem apartment building. During the ride, Copney allegedly showed the Yale students $1,500 in cash and promised that he had the rest of the money in a cash box at his apartment.
When they arrived at the apartment Copney allegedly claimed that he did not have the key to the building and, according to the memorandum, said that he needed to call his friend, “Fat Boy,” whom Jiggetts later identified as himself.
Bolton told investigators that Jiggetts left him, Copney, and King. The three men went upstairs to an apartment.
Copney said he did not have the key to the apartment itself and left Bolton and King waiting outside the door.
Copney returned one minute later with Jiggetts, who had a pistol in his hand, according to court documents.
Bolton, prosecutors said in the memorandum, told investigators that Copney said something like, “Ya, this is what it is.”
Copney told Bolton to give him the bag of marijuana and also took Bolton’s driver’s license and King’s Yale University ID, the document said.
Bolton told Copney and Jiggetts that he did not have money to return home, so Jiggetts gave the two Yale men $50 to take a taxi home, according to the document.
Months after the robbery, in March 2009, Copney allegedly called Bolton at Yale and instructed him to withdraw $10,000 from his bank account and drop the money off at a location in New York City, according to the filing.
Bolton told Copney that he had stopped dealing drugs and would not pay the money. According to the memorandum, on the phone, Copney allegedly threatened Bolton by referencing several locations around Bolton’s dorm and later leaving a voice message saying, “If you like your life, you should drop off the money.”
KIRKLAND TRIAL
According to investigators, Smith did not initially disclose that she was aware of the robbery of the two Yale students. Only after later testimony did prosecutors learn that she knew of the robbery and had allegedly hidden some of the items stolen from the two students, according to the District Attorney’s filing.
In Campbell’s testimony of September 2009 described in court documents, she told investigators that she had told Smith that Copney had robbed the Yale students.
The IDs from the Yale robbery were discovered with the murder weapon from the Kirkland shooting under a bed in a Lowell House dorm room.
Smith told investigators that she placed the gun under her friend’s bed in Lowell.
Smith is accused of possessing the murder weapon and misleading the grand jury, in addition to other charges.
Campbell and Jiggetts appeared in court on Friday as prosecution witnesses against Smith. During their testimonies, both acknowledged that Jiggetts and Copney had stolen marijuana from the Yale students, according to The Boston Globe,
According to Copney’s lawyer John A. Amabile, Copney has been charged as an accessory to the robbery of the Yale students.
Amabile said that he does not think that the robbery is pertinent to the Kirkland shooting case and has asked that the judge dismiss the charge.
“Why is that relevant to whether [Copney] committed a murder six months later in the basement of a Harvard dorm?” Amabile said. “It will make the jury think [Copney] is a bad person.”
Salem Superior Court Judge John Lu—who Amabile said will preside over Copney’s upcoming trial—will review Amabile’s motions to dismiss the charges relating to the New York robbery or separate those charges into a different trial in Salem on Monday.
Both Bolton and King did not respond to phone calls yesterday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As legal proceedings move forward against the four defendants charged with participating in the 2009 killing in the basement of Kirkland House, two defendants plan to plead guilty while the two others—the man who allegedly pulled the trigger and the Harvard student who is charged with aiding the murderers—are set to stand trial next month.Prosecutors allege that Jason Aquino, Jabrai Jordan Copney, and Blayn Jiggetts—aided after the fact by Copney’s then-girlfriend Brittany J. Smith, a Harvard student at the time—all entered the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway with the intent to steal drugs and money from Justin Cosby. The three men then left together once Cosby, a 21-year-old Cambridge resident, had been mortally wounded by the gun they brought.
Yet almost two years later, the legal outlook for each defendant has taken its own trajectory.
THE ALLEGED SHOOTER
The trial of Copney, a New York resident accused of firing the shot that killed Cosby, is set to begin on April 4 in Middlesex Superior Court.
In a hearing yesterday, Superior Court Judge Wendie I. Gershengorn approved motions to allow funds for Copney to contract with an expert on fingerprints, an expert on DNA, and an investigator, according to Copney’s attorney John A. Amabile and court documents.
The court deemed Copney to be indigent in Nov. 2010 and appointed Amabile as his lawyer at that time. Yesterday, Amabile said that since the government may call forensic experts as witnesses, his client needed financial assistance to fund experts who may present an opposing view.
A lawyer familiar with the case posited two avenues on which Copney’s eventual defense may focus—the characterization of the three men’s intentions going into the meeting with Cosby, and the question of who fired the lethal shot.
Court documents allege that when Aquino, Copney, and Jiggetts met Cosby at Harvard on May 18, 2009, Cosby believed the men wanted to buy marijuana from him. But the three New York men all understood that they were going to rob Cosby rather than conduct a transaction with him, the court documents allege.
The lawyer familiar with the Kirkland shooting said that Copney’s defense could hinge in part on a claim that this meeting was indeed intended as a drug deal rather than a robbery.
In addition, the lawyer noted that Jiggetts has testified that he loaded the ammunition into the murder weapon in Smith’s Lowell House dorm room prior to the shooting, possibly linking him rather than Copney to the handling of the gun.
MURDER TO MANSLAUGHTER
Aquino and Jiggetts—the two men who allegedly accompanied Copney from New York to Cambridge and into the basement of the Kirkland annex on the day of the attempted “drug rip”—both plan to plead guilty. In exchange for pleading guilty and cooperating with the prosecution in its case against the other two defendants, the charges of first-degree murder against the men will be reduced to manslaughter.
A first-degree murder conviction entails a mandatory sentence of life without parole in Massachusetts, whereas manslaughter carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.
Aquino is expected to plead guilty when he next appears in court this Thursday.
Jiggetts’ intent to plead guilty became evident, according to The Boston Globe, when he took the stand as a witness for the prosecution during a hearing last week. He is expected to change his plea only after he aids the prosecution as a witness in Copney’s trial, according to the lawyer familiar with the case.
Middlesex District Attorney’s Office Spokesperson Cara O’Brien refused to confirm that Jiggetts would plead guilty and noted that at the moment, Jiggetts is scheduled to be tried at the end of April.
EX-STUDENT TO STAND TRIAL
Smith, the final defendant, was a Harvard senior at the time of the shooting. She is scheduled to be tried in May.
Prosecutors say that Copney, who was Smith’s boyfriend at the time, and the other two men used Smith’s Harvard ID to access the basement of the Kirkland annex, where the shooting took place. Court documents further allege that Smith hid the murder weapon in a friend’s dorm room and helped the three men flee to New York by bus after the murder.
In July 2009, Smith signed an agreement with the district attorney’s office that granted her immunity from criminal charges in exchange for her testimony against the other defendants. In March 2010, however, prosecutors said that Smith had intentionally misled investigators, violating the agreement. She was then indicted on six criminal counts, including serving as an accessory after the fact to a murder, unlawfully possessing a firearm, and willfully misleading police and a grand jury.
She appeared in court for a motion hearing last week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What defines an All-American? According to Walter Camp, the great 19th-century Yale football coach, it is defined not only as one of the best players in the nation, but also one who possesses “unselfishness, sincerity, [and] leadership in the interests of sportsmanship and fair play.”
The criteria for being named an All-American today are more based on athletic performance than the content of one’s character.
This weekend, another Walter—this one from Camp’s rival Harvard—earned the lofty distinction in the 157-pound wrestling division at the 2011 NCAA Championships.
Though sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman earned the honor with an eighth-place finish at the championships in Philadelphia on Sunday, according to his teammates and friends, Peppelman also successfully fits Camp’s 120-year-old ideal.
“He’s such a good person, always willing to help out with whatever you need,” says sophomore Steven Keith, who also competed at nationals in the 125-pound division. “Whether it’s problems with friends, family, [or] school, he’s always there for us.”
Peppelman came to Harvard as a prized recruit out of Harrisburg, Penn., and impressed teammates as soon as he arrived in Cambridge for his freshman season.
“From the get-go, we knew he was really tough, and it’s been great seeing him put in so much hard work to improve,” co-captain Andrew Knapp says.
Last year, Peppelman started off his sophomore campaign in the 149-pound class. But in December, before the heart of the season began, Peppelman suffered a partially-torn elbow ligament that put him out of commission for the rest of the year.
Due to Harvard’s eight-semester limit, Peppelman chose to withdraw from school in order to maintain his athletic eligibility.
During his time off, he returned to Harrisburg to serve as an assistant coach at his alma mater, Central Dauphin High School, where he helped coach his younger brother—now wrestling at Cornell—and the team to a state championship.
After the season, he worked in his local state senator’s office and got the opportunity to travel to Russia to work out in what Peppelman calls “the mecca of wrestling.”
The grappler returned to campus eight pounds heavier and ready to meet challenges on the mat, filling the shoes of 157-pound national champion J.P. O’Connor ’10.
Peppelman also succeeded O’Connor in the locker room, assuming the role of co-captain as a sophomore.
“[O’Connor and Peppelman] are both class acts and their relationship is tremendous,” says Crimson coach Jay Weiss, who has coached 17 All-Americans during his tenure at Harvard. “J.P. talked to him a lot in preparation for nationals, helping him manage expectations and get rid of those first-year jitters. Clearly, it made an impact on him.”
Entering the season unranked, Peppelman was able to battle his way to the No. 8 spot, an impressive feat that Weiss attributes largely to his toughness as an individual and his role as a co-captain.
“Becoming a captain as a sophomore can be tough, but I knew he was ready,” Weiss says. “He’s really embraced the notion that the more you give, the more you receive. The summer before his freshman year, I had a feeling he’d be one of our great captains, and it’s a pleasure to see him living up to that.”
Despite his accomplishments, Peppelman is soft spoken and decidedly modest in speaking of his success.
“I’m extremely thankful for my teammates and entire support network,” says Peppelman, as his tone changes from excitement over his performance to reserved sincerity. “From the starters, to the non-starters, to the injured guys, we’ve really become a family. They all traveled to nationals to support me and Steven. I’m thankful for each and every one of them.”
He is still quietly confident about his future in wrestling.
“The ultimate goal is a national championship, and this is certainly a step in the right direction,” Peppelman says. “Coming into the year, few would have expected this. I was just fortunate that things worked out for me.”
He is quick to point out that becoming a national champion doesn’t come easily, but he is not alone in setting such lofty goals for himself.
“From the moment I met him, I knew something was different,” Weiss says. “He has the ability to be a national champion.
Whether he makes it or not, he’ll always have this season to remember.”
“Everyone on the team loves him,” Knapp adds. “I really can’t say enough good things about him.”
Sounds like an All-American in the truest sense of the word.

While the rest of the Harvard student body slept away their spring breaks, junior pitcher Rachel Brown and the Crimson softball team were busy touring California for the University of California Riverside Tournament, Marina International Hotel Showcase, and the San Diego Classic II.
Harvard (8-8) racked up four wins and two losses in the UCR tournament, went 1-1 at the Marina Showcase at Loyola Marymount, and lost four times before a much-needed win to end the roadtrip. From the mound, Brown anchored the team throughout.
“Rachel pitched outstandingly throughout California,” junior infielder Whitney Shaw said. “There was tough competition, tough batters, and tough losses, but Rachel had the mentality that she was going to mow down every single batter no matter what. Nothing brought her down.”
Brown played eight of the 11 games in California, winning seven and losing four. In her 46.2 innings of play, Brown struck out 76—an average of 9.5 per game, or 1.65 strikeouts each inning.
Regardless of the result of each game, Brown maintained her composure, consistently providing strong performances for the Crimson.
“I thought Rachel was a leader in the circle for us this week,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “She kept us in all the games, even those we lost. Our offense sort of needs to step up and score runs to support her.”
While throughout the week Brown pitched impressively, the California native bested herself in the final game of the week against San Diego. The Crimson came into the last match of the week coming off a four-game team losing streak in the San Diego Classic II.
“It was a big game for us. One of the preseason goals we had set was to come out of preseason with a record of .500 or better, so we had to win this game,” Shaw said. “Also, this game set the tone for the long stretch of games coming up.”
“Another element was that it was San Diego, Rachel’s hometown,” she added.
Brown pitched a seven-inning shutout silencing the Toreros’ offense with a dominant pitching performance. In the 1-0 victory, the Crimson starter managed 15 strikeouts, and San Diego’s only hit was an infield single. The Toreros only came to the plate 22 times in seven innings, meaning Brown allowed just one over the minimum.
Brown’s pitching performance against San Diego marks a season high in strikeouts and her second shutout this year. She leads the Crimson with 104 strikeouts so far this season.
“Rachel is in a really good place right now. This is the strongest she’s looked in the preseason,” Allard said. “She just needs to keep working game-to-game and pitch-to-pitch. Rachel is physically stronger and mentally more experienced, so this is bound to be a great season for her.”
But Brown set the bar incredibly high her sophomore season: she set Harvard records for opponent batting average in a season, strikeouts in a season, strikeouts per game, and shutouts. Additionally Brown led the Ivy league in opponent batting average, strikeouts in the season, shutouts, appearances, and earned-run average, earning her a spot on the All-Ivy League first-team.
Still, Brown appears to be well on her way to breaking her records from last season, and continues to play a vital role on the Crimson, earning the decision in seven of the eight Harvard victories this season.
“Her presence on the mound is one of confidence. She definitely comes off as cool, calm, and collected,” Shaw said. “She just goes out there and gets the job done. She is never ostentatious, just strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With spring break nearing a close, the Harvard sailing team took to the water this past weekend, looking to return to campus with two more solid regattas under its belt. Although the Crimson was unable to claim victory in either regatta, both the co-ed and the women’s squads finished in the middle of the pack in what proved to be a deep and competitive field.
The co-ed squad came out of the third event of its spring season with a ninth-place finish, while the women’s team also recorded a ninth-place finish of its own.
“We’ve had two pretty stacked competitions so far this past weekend and the previous one,” sophomore crew Alma Lafler said. “The first weekend went very well, and even though we didn’t win the regatta, we did well against [first-ranked] Boston College. We wanted to bring that to the races this past weekend.”
Despite a mediocre finish, the team says it gained valuable experience over the weekend.
“Our season really just started this spring break,” junior Emily Lambert said. “Being able to practice in proper sailing conditions for the first time really helped us get started for the rest of the season.”
TRUXTUN UMSTED TROPHY
After two very strong showings to start its spring season, the co-ed team entered the 64th Truxtun Umsted Trophy Regatta as the seventh-ranked team in the nation. With a first-place finish at the Sharpe Trophy Team Race and a third-place finish at the 18th St. Mary’s Team Race, Harvard’s top co-ed sailors traveled down to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., this past weekend hoping to continue its trend of success.
The Crimson was unable to grab the win, as it faced stiff competition in the field of 19 teams, finishing in ninth place with a total of 646 points, only two points behind eighth-place Stanford.
The third-ranked College of Charleston team took the lead after the first day of racing and did not relinquish it, taking the victory with 386 points.
The regatta was divided into two parts—the A- and B-divisions raced in double-handed boats, while the C- and D-divisions were single-handed.
Harvard sent out senior Alan Palmer to skipper all 17 races in Division A, and seniors John Stokes, Meghan Wareham, and Quincy Bock as well as freshman Luke O’Connor shared crew duties. The combined effort from the five members of the co-ed squad gave the Crimson an eighth-place finish.
The team took home a tenth-place finish in the B-division. Stokes and junior Brendan Kopp shared duties as skipper, and Wareham, O’Connor, Lafler, and—when he was not skippering—Stokes handled the crew responsibilities.
Senior Tedd Himler and sophomore Jason Michas represented Harvard in the C-division and D-division, respectively, in the individual sailing portion of the regatta.
Himler finished in eighth, a team-high for the regatta, and Michas captured 12th in his division for the Crimson.
“This past weekend was hard for us,” Lafler said. “We didn’t have prime conditions weather-wise, and being a smaller team, it was harder for us in the weather that was windier than we’re used to with more waves. We were demoralized after the first day, which continued on the second day. But looking up from here on out, we have five great seniors to lead us to better results, and we will bounce back.”
ST. MARY’S WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONAL
The 13th-ranked Harvard women’s squad competed at the St. Mary’s Women’s Intersectional a week after the co-ed squad captured a third-place finish at the team race at the St. Mary’s Team Race. But the women’s contingent couldn’t repeat its performance from a week prior, and matched the co-ed team with a ninth-place finish.
Sailors from Yale took home top honors.
“We had some ups and downs as a team this past weekend,” Lambert said. “Sunday was full of tricky sailing, and we struggled a bit, but we pulled through.”
The A-division of racing saw the Crimson send out Lambert and fellow junior Alexandra Jumper, a duo that once again proved to be a dominant force on the water. The two finished in the top seven in 13-of-14 races, with three first-place finishes, and they earned first-place overall in the A-division.
The freshman trio of Morgan Russom, Isabel Ruane, and Caitlin Watson took home 14th out of the field of 18 with a score of 163, sailing against some of the toughest competition that the squad has faced yet this season.
“The team, especially the freshmen, gained a lot of experience sailing at this last regatta,” Lambert said. “The conditions weren’t all that great, and we were using fluky boats that we haven’t sailed in since last season. They have a ton of potential, and it will show as the season goes on.”

Occasionally, the housing lottery can have humorous results. Just ask Matt P. Abrams '14, who was the freshman who advocated for Crimson Yard freshmen (Pennypacker, Hurlbut, Greenough, and Wigglesworth) to gain access to Adams dining hall while he was running for UC rep. This was met by controversy by Adams residents, who went as far as to organize a protest by eating dinner in his dorm, Pennypacker.
In an comical twist, Abrams became a resident of Adams House on housing day and now has the ability to eat in the dining hall that was once restricted to him.
"I still can't get over the cosmic irony of the River Gods, but I'm very excited to become an Adams resident next year," Abrams said.

New Haven, home to illustrious Yale University, is in 12th place in CNBC's slideshow "20 Cities You Don’t Want to Live In ... Yet," sandwiched between Memphis, Tenn. in 11th place and Baltimore, Md. in 13th.
The reasons? CMBC reports that New Haven struggles from high crime, high costs of living, high taxes, a high unemployment rate, and sub-par schools. But it's not all bad. Listed among New Haven's few redeeming factors is the perk that the city is just 90 minutes away from Manhattan by train. To students of Yale University, this knowledge may bring some small comfort, as they are usually confined to the 12-block bubble of academia that surrounds campus.
Yalies may also find some solace in New Haven's initiative to "attract more videogame makers," according to CNBC, as part of their plan to diversify the economy. In a city where the alternate forms of entertainment are the Kmart down the street and the library's vast collection of 17th century German literature, a booming video game industry may help turn things around for college students looking for a more efficient method of procrastination.
CNBC also noted that the unemployment rate has fallen from 9.7 percent to 9 percent, giving Yale College graduates a slightly more secure foothold in today's competitive job market.

Alexander B. Heffner '12 has a message for prospective college students—"be careful what you wish for." In an op-ed published by U.S. News & World Report, Heffner challenges the true value behind Harvard's reputation, comparing his current schooling in the Ivy League to his time at Andover and making it clear that a Harvard education is sub-par.
"I often feel obliged to tell people, even if they don't ask, that it was Andover (not Harvard) that taught to me to think and write critically," Heffner wrote in the op-ed.
The op-ed, which claims "there is an end to genuine learning" at Harvard, was, according to Heffner's response to an email inquiry, the cumulative product of "concerns with the environment in Cambridge since freshman year." The voiced concerns, in the form of an op-ed, have attracted many comments both in support and opposition on the U.S. News & World Report website.
Heffner explained that many of the problems he has with Harvard are attributable to the size of the school and its correspondingly large lectures.
"My overwhelming conclusion is that prospective undergrads should look elsewhere first and weigh what is truly most essential to them, the classroom experience or the perceived status," Heffner wrote. "For most students in the position to decide amongst highly selective schools, prestige becomes overrated in the decision-making process."
Heffner refused to comment when asked whether he regrets his own decision to come to Harvard. In his op-ed he does warn potential students not to "make the same mistake [he did]."
Mistake or not, Heffner is here and has no plans to transfer. Rather, he intends to keep making his opinion known from inside the Harvard community.
"If in a year and a half my feeling has changed, I will document that publicly as well," Heffner wrote.
