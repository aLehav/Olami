After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professor Alberto Alesina was one of a kind. In the past few days, countless economists have mourned his untimely passing in light of his pioneering contributions to the field of political economy. Not one of them has failed to mention what a wonderful and warm person he was.
Both of us had the luck of knowing Professor Alesina as a mentor whose ability to encourage, inspire, include, and bring joy to the field of economics made our four years at Harvard extraordinary. Despite the College’s overt commitment to student life, mentorship can sometimes be difficult to find at a decentralized, research-intensive institution like Harvard. Professor Alesina’s commitment to and belief in the scholarly potential of students, regardless of their background or past experience, was both remarkable and invaluable.
That Professor Alesina was unique became clear to us from the first lecture of his undergraduate class, Economics 1018: “Cultural Economics.” Clad in a stylish velvet blazer and red round glasses, he taught us about topics ranging from empirical tests of Max Weber’s hypotheses to how historical societies’ use of the plough influenced contemporary gender roles. His studies, which drew inspiration from cultural anthropology, political science, and sociology, fundamentally expanded our perception of what economics could be.
He stood out among all professors we have encountered in his ability to engage with and include students in exhilarating discussions. He constantly asked questions, encouraging us to come up with potential explanations for the results of studies before giving us the authors’ own. “Has anyone seen ‘Good Bye, Lenin!’?” he would ask, referring to the German tragicomedy about the fall of the Berlin Wall, before presenting research on the lasting effects of communism on people’s preferences for state intervention. He introduced a unit on the intergenerational persistence of culture by relating it to the early 2000s romantic comedy “Bend it Like Beckham.”
Crucially, Professor Alesina had unparalleled respect for his students’ ideas. For him, an undergraduate’s ideas were as valuable as those of a tenured professor visiting his lectures, and he would not hesitate to stop the latter to make sure that the former could voice a question.
After a presentation in a class one of us took with him, he emailed “great job tonight !!! well done! you and emile were a phenomenal team.” Coming from him, such words of encouragement ––  common and incredibly kind –– always seemed effortless.
We both went on to write senior theses under Professor Alesina’s guidance. While we could always rely on his vast knowledge of the issues that interested us, he let us explore questions on our own terms, giving us breathing space to come to our own conclusions. He devoted a lot of effort to including us, two undergraduates, in academic discussion and making the Economics Department feel like a place where we had a voice and belonged. We could always look forward to an (otherwise unexpected) email announcing which exciting new scholar visiting Harvard we should talk to. After one of us got a post-graduate job in a field unrelated to economics, he would make a point of asking about “when the plans to apply to graduate school would come” as a gentle reminder not to let go of that aspiration. That the other will be pursuing a Ph.D. next year would have been impossible without this kind of support.
He enthusiastically agreed to do an independent study with one of us, effectively adding another full class to his schedule that semester. We met every week to discuss the newest papers on the topic of media economics, except for the rare occasions when he was skiing, which was his other great passion. At the end of our reading group of two, he remarked on how much he had learned — a testament to his enduring, exceptionally humble curiosity.
Ultimately, Professor Alesina was a most thoughtful and supportive mentor. Minor hiccups, such as a bad exam grade, did not concern him, or abate his support for our future as researchers. When either of our plans for the future seemed insecure, he offered an opportunity to continue pursuing research, without any reservations. He also generously shared stories about his own personal difficulties, including his first year in the United States as a graduate student. He managed to do all this with his renowned flair and gentle, self-deprecating sense of humor. “I too was a research assistant once — for Adam Smith on ‘The Wealth of Nations,’” he once jokingly remarked.
“Never eat carbonara in the U.S., but also not even in most places in Italy,” was his mischievous recommendation in typical Italian fashion. Asked about important articles on a particular topic, he once said “just read all the papers I wrote.” He was entirely justified in saying so — his mark on economics is as diverse as it is immense.
But our debt to him is more than intellectual. As we find ourselves at the crossroads of college and “the real world,” Professor Alesina’s absence has made what should have been a new beginning feel like a standstill. Without his unwavering support, we likely would not have wanted to pursue our passion for economics. It is difficult to envision the discipline without him. His is a tragic loss to everyone who has known him, and to all who will not have that honor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I like to think of myself as a relatively well-informed person. I keep up to date with the daily news and the happenings of the world. However, as depressing as it was for the previous couple months — still reeling from the virus, from Ahmaud Aubery’s murder and the doubtful look in my mother’s eyes each time I walk out the door to go for a run, I decided I would take a break from the news for just one day … to just read a book, play a game, watch Netflix. To take just one day to exist. But like clockwork, and with the kind of sick poetry that only America can provide, former officer Derek Chauvin reminded me that I am not allowed to just exist.
He may have told George Floyd to “relax” when he said he couldn’t breathe but the message I heard could not have been more of the opposite. He might as well have said, “Watch out n****r; this could be you spitting your last words into the asphalt,” because that’s what I heard. I heard my own voice. Straining. Calling out for my mom and my family. I feel that pain, every single day I “exist.” I feel powerless to remove that pain. I feel scared because of the pain. But more so than anything else I am enraged by that pain.
Then I can’t help but be reminded that all of what I just described is personal. All of the emotions I mentioned are just one man’s emotions. That could have been any of us on the ground in Minneapolis. My powerlessness, my fear, and my rage are all just one black person’s emotions out of tens of millions of the same emotions in the U.S. and one of the billions who feel for their brothers all around the world. That is a collective pain, a collective powerlessness, a collective fear. The rage that I feel is a rampant, collective rage.
I was having a conversation with one of my close friends about all of this and he said, “Bro, we need another column,” because “there’s pain in the black community and, today, I’m not gonna lie, it’s affected me.” And with all honesty, my initial response was that I probably wouldn’t write this piece. I told him that my column has been a space for internal black dialogues, and America’s “criminal” “justice” system is just something so big and externally imposed on us that I felt too powerless to say anything useful about it. And he understood that feeling and sympathized with the emotional burden of vocalizing the emotions and pain we all feel.
He agreed with me about our powerlessness, but in the same breath, he said something that I found so profoundly powerful: “We’ll be fine. We’ll overcome. We will overcome.” And that really stuck with me. Because that contrast — between accepting our powerlessness and having an undying faith in our improved future — is something so profoundly typical of all black peoples. Throughout history — in defiance of logic, reason, and some of the most oppressive systems ever created — we have always remained hopeful in our ability to overcome. And we have a strong track record of overcoming precisely because of that relentless hope that leads us to continue to take powerful actions — exactly like what we are seeing now.
That resilience of character is so central to blackness. Blackness in America, blackness in Africa, blackness across the entire diaspora. We may not always know how, and it may not always seem likely, but we always know that we will reach that mountaintop. Our belief is never in question. Our belief is bigger than European empires. Our belief is bulletproof. Our belief is stronger than chains. Our belief cannot be outshone by our immense rage.
Our belief cannot be choked on a street corner.
And so, as we’ve always done, with spirituals and songs, with poetry and art, with speeches and protest, with love and with courage, we should remind ourselves that we will overcome now. We must not ignore the powerlessness, fear, and rage that we are all feeling at the moment. But we must harness them, in combination with our “unchokable” belief in our power to overcome, as the impetus to change the world and the systems that we live in.
To honor our brothers George and Ahmaud, our sister Breonna, and all that came before them, we cannot, as a black community, lose hope in the face of America’s seemingly permanent systemic racism.
But, everyone, as a part of the larger Harvard, American, and global community, let us all take this moment to channel the rage we feel into analyzing the ways in which we go about the world. To truly investigate the systems, institutions, and parts of society that we support, contribute to, and take part in and ask ourselves how we are contributing to the problem, or at least, allowing it to exist.
And if you find that you are doing anything short of actively fighting systemic racism, then you are assisting its continued existence. Because one thing is certain, we will overcome. But will that be in spite of you? Or because of you?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
City of Cambridge officials held a virtual vigil Monday evening in memory of George Floyd, a black man murdered by a white Minneapolis police officer last week.
Hosted jointly by the City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Peace Commission — a city department that aims to promote diversity and cooperation — the vigil featured short statements by Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale, City Councilor E. Denise Simmons, Cambridge Police Department officials, and religious leaders.
The vigil comes off the heels of ongoing nationwide protests against police brutality and white supremacy in the wake of Floyd’s killing, the most recent in a series of murders of black people in America — including Ahmaud M. Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade.
Livestreamed from Cambridge City Hall, the vigil was simulcast on social media and local TV; on Facebook, the event garnered more than 750 viewers.
Reverend Lorraine Thornhill, who serves as the president of the Cambridge Black Pastors Alliance, delivered the invocation. She began by recognizing the pain people of color have faced in Cambridge and across the country, imploring policymakers to take tangible steps towards change.
“We pray today to give legislators wisdom to enact policies to protect black people that have been targeted for centuries,” she said at the vigil. “Hear our cry for righteousness and justice this day.”
Siddiqui then urged Cambridge residents to band together in allyship to combat racism and racial violence in the city.
“The allyship of our community members, of those of us who are white and non-black people of color, plays a tremendous role in creating the cultural shifts that we need,” Siddiqui said. “I stand with all Cambridge residents to say: not one more.”
Simmons said many families, including her own, have felt anxiety amid Floyd’s murder and others that came before it.
“I can’t breathe for my seven-year-old granddaughter, so afraid and asking me: ‘Why do they kill us?’” Simmons said.
CPD Superintendent Christine Elow said that the police department is “working hard to develop best practices in policing — arrests as a last resort.”
Two years ago, CPD arrested a black Harvard College student, and one officer repeatedly punched the student while he was on the ground. CPD later defended the officers’ actions in a tweet after students decried the arrest as police brutality.
“Are we perfect? No. But we are committed to setting a standard of what policing should look like,” Elow said Monday.
Brian Corr, executive director of the city’s Peace Commission, closed out the ceremony by invoking Floyd's name.
“George Floyd. Say his name,” Corr said. “Thank you for joining us, take care, stay safe, work for justice, and care for those around you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 7, 2020, 6:18 p.m.
Harvard’s Anthropology department has removed professor Gary Urton as the Director of Undergraduate Studies in light of allegations that he pressured a former student into unwelcome sex, per an email sent to undergraduate concentrators Tuesday.
“To clarify now that we have information: Gary Urton is no longer DUS. He has been formally removed from that position,” assistant director of undergraduate studies Zoe A. Eddy wrote. In July, Professor Ieva Jusionyte will replace Urton as DUS, the email added.
An investigation by The Crimson published last week found a former student accused Urton of sexual harassment in 2016.
According to an affidavit she filed in federal court, the former Extension School student reported to an FAS sexual harassment officer in 2016 that Urton had pressured her into “unwelcome sex” before writing her a recommendation letter in 2011, though she never filed a formal charge against him.
Eddy wrote that many undergraduates have had direct contact with Urton over the course of their time in the department.
“On the Gary Urton case. I've met with many of you: this hits home. Every single one of you has been impacted by the information that has come out about Gary Urton. He was the Director of Undergraduate Studies and lead this program,” her email reads. “For those of you in Latin American Studies and Archaeology, he is a leading expert in the field, and someone you worked closely with. Many of you were in the field with him.”
The email also addressed a number of steps the undergraduate Anthropology program is taking in response to the sexual misconduct allegations against Urton and Anthropology professors John L. Comaroff and Theodore C. Bestor. The pair will hold an open forum for concentrators on Friday, establish an undergraduate committee, and work with University offices to develop ongoing resources related to sexual misconduct.
Department chair Ajantha Subramanian and interim chair Rowan K. Flad announced Saturday the formation of a standing committee to “work to dismantle” structures that contributed to “an environment in which abuses continue to manifest and go undetected.”
Urton could not immediately be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College hosted a town hall Tuesday afternoon to update affiliates on the administration’s planning process for what is certain to be a singular fall semester.
More than two thousand affiliates tuned into the Zoom event, at which Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana spoke in conversation with Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh, Dean of Students Katherine G. O'Dair, and Registrar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Co-Director of Harvard College Emergency Management Mike Burke about how the College plans to address continued COVID-19 concerns when classes resume.
O'Dair began her remarks by acknowledging that preoccupations with the pandemic and fall planning have been surmounted in recent days by the nationwide tragedy and outcry against police brutality and anti-black racism prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade.
“I want to note that we're doing this work of preparing to return to campus while our society is literally burning,” O’Dair said.
Administrators spent most of the town hall offering insight into the highly structured planning process for the fall term. Burke said there are more than 100 people advising the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, College, and University leadership on planning for the fall term, including public health experts, faculty, staff, and students.
FAS currently has 11 working groups dedicated to different areas of preparation: decision framework; five-year horizon; financial planning; “Go for Fall”; restarting scholarship, houses and facilities; enrollment; scheduling; testing and tracing; remote experience; and Division of Continuing Education coordination.
Khurana said the working groups are each guided by four principles: ensuring health and safety, protecting the College’s academic enterprise, leveraging the “breadth and diversity” of the Harvard community, and preserving access and affordability. He said administrators intend to send students information about returning to campus by early July.
As Harvard decides the format of the fall semester, administrators said they are committed to keeping open channels of communication between the working groups and affiliates.
“Let me be very clear, preparing campus for students is our top priority,” Burke said.
Claybaugh said the coming fall semester would mark a return to normal grading. She explained that administrators designed this spring’s Emergency Satisfactory-Unsatisfactory system to address the unanticipated changes to course formats and student life after the campus evacuation.
“Emergency grading was passed for one semester only because the emergency it addressed was the abrupt interruption of the semester and the abrupt scattering of the students, the abrupt translation of courses to online formats,” she said. “None of that will be the case in the fall.”
Some students have expressed anxiety that a remote fall semester will subject them to the same inequities that prompted the switch to emergency grading in the first place, such as lack of internet access, study spots, and on-campus support resources.
Responding to those concerns, Claybaugh said the administration will ensure all students “can do their best work” in the case of a virtual fall by distributing loaner laptops and hotspots, as well as bringing undergraduates who lack quiet study spaces at home back to campus.
“This is the new normal,” she said. “We are going to have to work together as a community to find new ways of living and working until there's a vaccine. And so we can't kind of put a pause on everything, including the giving of grades.”
O’Dair said the College will not change its current “liberal” leave of absence policy, which allows students to take time off if they choose.
In recent weeks, some students have said they would consider taking a leave of absence next semester should courses continue online. However, many made the caveat that their decision was contingent upon whether the College would change its leave of absence policies, such as withholding financial aid or forcing students to take multiple semesters off.
O’Dair said she wanted to stress that College students should have the same choice of taking a semester off as they would under normal circumstances.
“The only constraint we have is a structural one, not a policy one,” she said. “In the best of times with our fully dense campus we are at capacity in our houses in the yard. So if we have a surge of students taking a leave, we may not be able to house everyone upon their return. And that's not accounting for a possible reduced activity.”
She said the College hopes to share more information regarding leaves in the coming weeks, as the planning process moves toward a final decision about the fall term.
Claybaugh said the administrators would also take steps to confront the unique challenges international students face.
She first cited time zone differences, which kept some international students from synchronously participating in classes and required others to stay awake outside of “acceptable waking hours.”
Claybaugh said the Office of Undergraduate Education is working to adapt course schedules to mitigate these problems.
“I was also very surprised and distressed to hear from some of you that you had trouble with faculty refusing to or being reluctant to videotape courses for you,” she said. “We will absolutely require that in the fall.”
Claybaugh further acknowledged that visa regulations will likely raise thorny questions for international students about if and when they will be able to return to campus.
“Here, the answers are not in our hands,” she said. “They're in the hands of the government.”
She added that the administration is actively monitoring the situation and communicating with “government liaisons,” as well as repurposing the Office of International Education as “frontline advising” for international students.
Claybaugh said it remains unclear in what capacity the student body will return to campus in the fall. The current possibilities on the table run the gamut: bringing all students back, just some students, or none.
“But one thing is becoming clear,” Claybaugh said. “Wherever students end up living, whatever kind of residential arrangements were able to make, learning is going to have to be to a large extent — if not entirely — remote.”
She said as the public health situation becomes more clear, it has also become harder to imagine how students can safely gather in large lecture halls for courses without transmitting the virus.
Burke noted that one of Harvard’s Science Center lecture halls, which can normally accommodate hundreds of students, could theoretically seat only 87 students with proper social distancing procedures in place.
“That's our biggest lecture hall,” he said. “So you can get a sense of the scale.”
The Office of Undergraduate Education has gathered information from peer universities, faculty feedback, and student course evaluations from this spring to determine how to best approach another semester of online education.
For example, Claybaugh said many students expressed that courses where undergraduates could maintain connections with classmates and faculty members were the most successful.
“That's good news for us because that's actually our brand,” Claybaugh said. “What we do all the time, residentially, is create strong connections in the classroom among students and between students and faculty, so it’s just a matter of figuring out how to translate that into an online format.”
She added that her working group is also noting the needs of classes that face particular challenges adapting online, including those in the lab sciences, language courses, and arts classes.
Claybaugh also said all faculty members and teaching fellows will be undergoing training this summer to make their remote courses more engaging and effective.
Khurana said administrators have the shared goal of safely returning all students to campus as soon as possible.
“I recognize how important our presence with each other matters for our sense of the structured serendipity of meeting somebody new, to talking between classes and after classes, to connecting on the shuttle buses, to be able to return to our dorms and to our houses, to hear a conversation and be invited into that,” he said.
Still, Khurana added that the Harvard community is deeply embedded in Cambridge.
“We don’t exist in a vacuum,” he said. “Harvard can't make its decisions without considering its impact on the broader environment that we're in.”
O’Dair said a “social compact” regarding social distancing norms would be imperative to a successful return to campus life.
“I heard from many students that they want to return to campus and are willing to comply with whatever the rules are. And in principle that sounds simple,” she said. “But in reality, we know this is complex because it relies on individual actions to support a collective environment.”
“We will need to build a culture where a physical distance and measures are respected and adhered to not because it is the rule, but because it's our shared responsibility,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences plans to take a number of additional measures — including furloughing some employees — to generate revenue and cut its budget in the face of hundreds of millions in projected financial impact due to the coronavirus pandemic, FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in a Tuesday email to faculty and staff.
FAS expects to conclude the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, with an operating deficit of $42 million due to the costs of campus de-densification, the pivot to remote instruction, and the cancellation of continuing education programs, Gay wrote.
In the next fiscal year, FAS’s net funding from the endowment — which constitutes nearly half the FAS’s budget — will be down by 6 percent, per Gay’s email. It will receive about $48 million less than it expected from its endowment distribution due to the Harvard Corporation’s decision to reduce the distribution across all Harvard schools.
As part of a one-time special assessment, however, the Corporation will also give FAS around $23 million from restricted funds. Gay wrote that FAS will use the sum to finance “some essential elements” of FAS’s pandemic response — including masks and personal protective equipment and emergency funds for graduate students.
“The full financial impact of the pandemic on the FAS will be significant, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, on par with that of the 2008 financial crisis, if not greater,” Gay wrote. “And those impacts will not be limited to one year; we are on a changed trajectory that will persist for some time.”
“Though the full extent is not yet known, the global recession is likely to have deep impacts on endowment performance, as well as other revenue sources including philanthropy,” she added. “It will also impact student aid needs, as mounting job losses affect families’ ability to pay for college.”
The FAS is now “leaning into the growth potential” of the Division of Continuing Education to generate new revenue, engaging alumni and donors, and reducing construction spending, Gay wrote. The measures come in addition to the FAS’s April announcement that it would suspend capital projects and faculty searches and comply with a University-wide hiring and salary freeze.
But she added that FAS will furlough some “fully or partially idled” workers.
“Compensation is our largest expense category, at nearly 50% of the FAS expense budget,” she wrote. “We have already taken the step, consistent with University policy, to freeze salaries and this action will provide $15M in savings next year. But given reduced activities on campus, furloughs for fully or partially idled workers will also be necessary.”
Gay instructed all FAS units to reduce or eliminate non-essential spending, including travel, entertainment, supplies, equipment, and furniture. She noted that in Fiscal Year 2019, the FAS spent nearly $100 million on these activities, with one-third on travel and entertainment alone.
She also asked faculty to “pace and prioritize” spending to begin new research, and to make teaching plans that allow departments to hire fewer visiting instructors. She also wrote that faculty and staff should approach budgeting with a focus on “mission-critical activities,” promising additional budget guidance.
Gay also encouraged faculty to support Harvard affiliates by contributing to the Harvard College Fund, the Graduate School Fund, and the Harvard COVID-19 Employee Emergency Relief Fund, which respectively support undergraduates, graduate students, and employees facing economic hardship due to the pandemic. She wrote that she will contribute 15 percent of her salary to the three funds, and members of the FAS Academic Planning Group will each contribute at least 5 percent of their salaries.
Now that Commencement and the academic year have concluded, the FAS is focusing on charting a plan for students to safely return to campus, but does so “without a full view of the resources” at its disposal, Gay wrote.
“Our collective focus is trained on one goal—finding a path to safely return our students to campus and transforming the FAS for the long term to pursue excellence within our changed context,” Gay wrote. “To accomplish this, we will need to draw on all of our resources, including our community’s ingenuity and insight, which is happening now through a fall planning process that engages more than 100 faculty and staff across eleven workstreams. We also must marshal our financial resources.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — moved to reduce the endowment payout for Fiscal Year 2021 by 2 percent and to make a special assessment of restricted assets as it projects a $750 million revenue shortfall.
In a standard year, the University draws around 5 percent of its endowment funds to cover roughly a third of its operating expenses. But given the 2 percent reduction, the payout is likely to total roughly 3 percent for FY21, which begins July 1.
The endowment was last valued at $40.9 billion in June 2019, though administrators have said its value has declined “substantially” due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Around 80 percent of the endowment — which is made up of over 13,000 individual funds — is typically restricted to a specific program, activity, or school by its donor. Harvard administrators have argued that they cannot reallocate restricted endowment funds to cover unexpected expenses.
“The vast majority of the endowment is highly restricted, and we cannot redirect funds that are restricted for one purpose to be used for another,” Bacow said in a May 22 interview with The Crimson. “Legally, we cannot do that. So, our ability to dip into the endowment is limited.”
But in FY21, the Harvard Corporation will take 3 percent of all restricted funds in the endowment and make them available for immediate use.
“The Corporation has decided to implement a one-time special assessment, an extraordinary step, taken in recognition of the urgent need for unrestricted funds to meet immediate challenges,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to FAS affiliates Tuesday.
That assessment will be applied across all Harvard’s schools.
Jonathan L. Swain, a spokesperson for the University, wrote in an emailed statement that the University will continue to use restricted funds for their restricted purposes, though the one-time assessment will provide extra funds. Swain listed room and board rebates, increased financial aid, and the protective supplies that will be needed to ensure the safe reopening of labs and campus as three potential areas where those funds may be spent.
“Similar to other institutions, Harvard’s endowed funds are subject to an annual assessment that provides financial resources for the general operations needed to support the programs or activities that are funded by the restricted funds,” Swain wrote. “Given the economic challenges of the public health crisis, the Corporation approved a one-time, additional assessment on all restricted funds to provide the University greater flexibility, through unrestricted current-use funds, in managing the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
This is not the first time the University has drawn from restricted endowment funds, according to Swain. The Corporation took a similar step in connection to a shortfall in the cost of employee benefits in 1997.
Harvard faces an uncertain financial future after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Market volatility will likely decrease the endowment's value, and revenue streams like executive and continuing education have dried up.
The University has invoked a number of austerity measures to try and mitigate the financial consequences of COVID-19, including salary and hiring freezes, cancelations and deferrals of capital projects, and the possibility of furloughs and layoffs.
Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that the University estimates it will lose $415 million in revenue in the current fiscal year and experience a $750 million revenue shortfall in FY21.
Hollister told the Gazette that although the endowment payout in FY21 will be less than this year’s, other factors may effectively render it one of the “largest in many years,” depending on how the stock market behaves, as a percentage of the endowment’s market value.
“So, although the endowment distribution across Harvard for FY21 will be 2 percent less than in FY20, the net effect is effectively 6 percent less to underlying fund beneficiaries, as the special assessment is about a 4 percent charge to begin to cover the pandemic-related costs,” he told the Gazette.
Thomas D. Parker ’64 — a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy — wrote in an email that reducing the payout by 2 percent seems “low.”
“Given the losses in the endowment, I would have thought that it would be more,” he wrote. “They look to be going out of their way to minimize the effect on the Schools’ budgets.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 3, 2020, at 7:23 p.m.
Six of Harvard’s 12 degree-granting schools will conduct classes remotely during the fall semester, they announced Wednesday.
Harvard Law School, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard Graduate School of Design, and Harvard Divinity School will hold classes online in the upcoming term; Harvard Graduate School of Education will conduct its classes and operations online for the entire 2020-2021 academic year.
Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget T. Long wrote in an email to affiliates that the school's decision “largely centers” on “disruptions to residential learning” as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
“In addition to the strong likelihood of intermittent periods of quarantine (orders to remain at home), we expect distancing measures will need to be in place through the entire academic year to continue to mitigate the spread of the virus,” Long wrote. “This scenario presents many challenges and likely multiple interruptions to an on-campus program, which would result in a severely altered experience that could compromise the HGSE learning experience.”
“Based on our specific context, programs, and diverse student body, we are not confident we can bring students to the HGSE campus in a safe, equitable, sustained way,” she added.
The Graduate School of Education already boasts a “strong track record” of experience in providing online offerings to students, according to Long’s email. She wrote that courses will be held both asynchronously and synchronously, to account for time zone differences.
“We are certain that the online learning you will undertake will be an experience you will deeply value--one that will prepare you for the changed world you will enter upon graduation,” Long wrote. “Building on our existing offerings, we are crafting online courses and co-curricular experiences that will take advantage of the best that digital learning has to offer, giving you unparalleled access to instructors and to peers.”
She added the school hopes to give students the option to come to campus for “a short residential experience,” and for Commencement, in May 2021, if public health conditions permit.
The changes the school plans to put in place will be more comprehensive than an attempt to shift its usual operations online, according to Long.
“In sum, this coming year will not simply be ‘HGSE online.’ This will be HGSE transformed,” Long said.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in an email to affiliates Wednesday that the school found it “necessary” to hold courses online in the fall.
“While we will keep you apprised as we learn more, we must now turn our focus fully to developing the best, most robust, highest-quality online academic, clinical, and extracurricular programming we can for the coming term,” he wrote.
The school will hold “comprehensive” online programming to support incoming students and work to create “meaningful interactions and connections outside the classroom and for supporting the extracurriculars that are an integral part of your law school experience,” per the email.
Manning wrote that the Law School will also work to address the difficulties some students face with remote learning environments, time zones, and available technology. He announced the school would create a Technology Assistance Fund, which will provide $1 million to help students overcome technological challenges in online learning; increase the times courses are available; and prioritize the use HLS dorms for those who need them.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an announcement to school affiliates Wednesday that the school “very reluctantly” concluded its instruction will occur exclusively online this fall.
Students will be able to choose whether they would like to defer, but tuition for the fall semester will remain the same, per the announcement.
“We are giving you another opportunity now to choose to defer before starting at the School,” Elmendorf wrote. “In contrast with our usual approach to deferrals—which requires that students demonstrate individual hardships or compelling alternative uses of their time—these deferrals are available to all of you who would prefer doing other activities in the coming year rather than being part of the Kennedy School remotely.”
School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams wrote in an email to affiliates Wednesday that the school’s own public health and infectious disease experts still observe in their work that the future is uncertain. Williams wrote the school cannot “ensure” a safe in-person semester, adding that reopening will take place in “phases.”
“What is clear is that the safety of the Harvard Chan School community is paramount, that we cannot ensure a safe return to in-person instruction in a way that would facilitate learning, and that, when the right time comes, we will bring our students and instructors together back on campus in carefully planned phases,” Williams wrote. “Our students—U.S. and international—must be able to continue their education without fear for their health, and many have expressed wanting to avoid unsafe travel and the need to care for family members.

“Our actions cannot worsen the public health crisis,” she added.
Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton wrote in an announcement Wednesday that the school will conduct all classes online this fall.
“With steps such as smaller class sizes, tuition on a per-course basis and flexible course loads, technological aides, and out-of-class virtual gathering and study opportunities, HDS faculty and staff are determined to do all in their power to recreate online the individualized instruction and community experience that are a hallmark of our educational mission,” Hempton wrote.
Design School Dean Sarah M. Whiting wrote in an email Wednesday to Design School affiliates that three factors influenced their decision: the safety of Design School affiliates, entry concerns for international students, and housing security in Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay has placed Anthropology professor Gary Urton on paid administrative leave following allegations of sexual misconduct against him, she wrote in an email to Anthropology students, faculty, and staff Wednesday morning.
The Crimson reported last week that a former student of Urton’s wrote in a sealed affidavit that he had pressured her into “unwelcome sex” in 2011.
Following the report, Jade d’Alpoim Guedes, a former Harvard Anthropology Ph.D. student, wrote in social media posts that Urton invited her to a hotel room while she was a graduate student.
In her email announcing the leave, Gay referenced both allegations. She also wrote that her office has heard from others who alleged Urton sexually harassed them.
“In addition to these public reports, my office has also received direct outreach from current and former members of our community recounting experiences of sexual harassment by Professor Urton,” Gay wrote.
“Due to the seriousness of these allegations, and in accordance with University and FAS policies, I write to announce that the FAS has placed Professor Urton on paid administrative leave, pending a full review of the facts and circumstances regarding the allegations that have come to light. This leave is effective immediately,” she added.
Urton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
