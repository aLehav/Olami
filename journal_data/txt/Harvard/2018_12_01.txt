After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 60 minutes of tight defense, staunch penalty-killing, and timely counter-attacking, the Crimson outlasted Rensselaer in a 2-0 decision.
With 4:36 left to play — as Harvard (3-5-1, 2-3-1 ECAC) clung to a 1-0 lead — the Engineers (4-8-4, 2-3-0 ECAC) drew an interference call on Crimson freshman defender Maryna MacDonald to set up a crucial power play opportunity. Tensions ran high in Bright-Landry Hockey Center as RPI seemed poised to convert on its fourth power play chance of the game after struggling on its first three. Not only did Harvard earn a hard-fought kill, however, but the squad also iced the game with a pivotal short-handed goal at the 2:58 mark of regulation.
“We stuck to the game plan,” freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere explained. “It just happened that we got a lucky bounce and just got a short-handed goal.”
Capitalizing on the fortuitous bounce, Della Rovere led the counter-attack in the dwindling seconds of the Engineer advantage. Trailing the play was sophomore forward Becca Gilmore, who opened up for a pass from Della Rovere. Deking towards the post, Gilmore tucked home a backhand finish over RPI captain and goaltender Lovisa Selander’s right pad to seal the win.
The Engineers would go on to pull Selander for the final couple of minutes in favor of an extra skater, but Harvard freshman goaltender Lindsay Reed and the rest of the Crimson defense held strong to preserve Reed’s first career shutout and the Harvard victory. In the effort, Reed was able to fend off all 26 shots that came her way.
“It was nice to get the monkey off my back for that one,” Reed said. “Hopefully there [are] many more [shutouts] to come.”
Della Rovere did not just contribute to the last goal, but she actually netted the first one herself. After about half a period’s worth of back-and-forth play, each team had generated a few scoring chances, but both defenses played physically and both goalies limited follow-up chances with careful rebound control. Nonetheless, with 7:55 remaining in the first frame, Della Rovere changed the game’s momentum and grabbed the game’s first goal.
“Coming on, working really hard, and having that urgency getting the first goal just kind of gives us that extra confidence moving forward,” Della Rovere said.
On the play, junior forward Kat Hughes hustled behind the net to earn possession of the puck before centering to co-captain forward Lexie Laing. From the slot, Laing ripped a shot to the low corner, which Selander quickly pushed aside with a last second right-toe kick. As Laing was releasing the puck and Selander reacting, Della Rovere jockeyed for position in front of the net. Positioning herself right on the edge of the crease, she potted the rebound before any Engineer could react.
“I think it started with support from my teammates,” Della Rovere said. “We were supporting each other in the corner and getting a lot shots. Just having that extra support allowed me to be open backdoor.”
The one finish would prove to be all the Crimson needed as Reed did not concede a goal throughout the contest. Notably, the Engineers generated their best scoring chances through odd-man rushes, but Reed proved to be up for the challenge. Looking to tie the game, as the second period wound down, RPI pushed forward on a 3-on-2 break only to the be thwarted by the right toe of Reed.
“[The key was] just staying calm and knowing that I’m big getting out there, presenting myself, and making the save,” Reed said.
Harvard would maintain the 1-0 edge as the teams headed to the locker room for the second intermission, but only after killing off 1:04 of penalty time at the end of the second as the officials had whistled for a hooking call on co-captain forward Kate Hallett. The RPI power play pressure would only intensify at the start of the third as Hughes took a slashing penalty nineteen seconds into the period. Faced with a 5-on-3 Engineer advantage, Crimson penalty killers managed to stay perfect and keep RPI off the board.
“I think our [penalty kill] is something that we should have pride in,” Della Rovere said. “I think we run a very strong PK.”
Despite the numbers deficit, Harvard tried to set the tempo on the penalty kill rather than try to react to the RPI attack. The approach seemed to work for the Crimson as the squad held the RPI power play 0-for-4 with only two aggregate shots.
“It starts with the faceoff at first, just trying to win the puck,” Reed said. “We’re being as aggressive as possible on the PK, so that helps. We’ve got to attack teams to get the puck out as quickly as possible.”
Bolstered by penalty-killing momentum, Harvard managed to hold the Engineers to only a couple of shots for the next few minutes of the period (and only six shots over the course of the entire period). In this time, the Crimson actually earned a power play of its own but failed to convert, leaving the scoreboard at 1-0 in Harvard’s favor heading into the closing stages of the game.
The Engineers last and best chance to even the scoreline came with their final power play opportunity, but the Crimson held RPI shotless over the 5-on-4 before Gilmore converted the game-clincher.
With the victory against the Engineers in hand, Harvard will immediately shift its focus to another conference foe in Union. The puck drops against the Dutchwomen Dec.1 at 3 pm in the Bright.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Result as of 9:26 P.M. Game story to follow.
The Harvard men's hockey team skated past then-No. 15 Cornell last Saturday at Madison Square Garden. The Big Red (5-5-0, 3-2-0 ECAC) has tripped to Cambridge hoping to taste revenge, but a clicking Harvard squad (4-3-2, 2-2-2) will have a say in that.
The Crimson has been riding the play of forwards Lewis Zerter-Gossage (8–2—10) and Casey Dornbach (2–13—15) and defenseman Adam Fox (5–15—20) on its ascent to above the .500 mark after multiple disappointing performances early on this season. Cornell will hope to return to its physical, defensive form after struggling to lock teams down in the young portion of the campaign.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Saturday’s big rivalry matchup with No. 16 Cornell, the Harvard men’s hockey team had the country’s best power play unit and fourth-best goals per game. The Big Red, despite its ranking, sat near the bottom of the NCAA in terms of penalty killing. As the contest played out, special teams were a factor — but in an unexpected way.
Cornell (6-5-0, 4-2-0 ECAC) outlasted a late push from Harvard (4-4-2, 2-3-2) to emerge with a 2-1 victory after going 2-for-4 on the power play. In fact, all three tallies in the game came on 5-on-4s. Despite the best efforts of senior net-minder Michael Lackey, the Crimson fell short after Friday’s decisive win, losing out on what would have been its first four-point weekend of the season. This loss is the home team’s last conference clash of the season, and comes just a week after it played spoiler to a Big Red-leaning crowd at Madison Square Garden.
“I thought we came out pretty strong,” co-captain Michael Floodstrand said. “[But] I think we kind of took our foot off the pedal a little bit late in the first, got dominated in the second…. Against a good team like that, they can just shut it down.”
The Crimson has had starting trouble often this year, but began the contest with jump. Instead, it was in the second period that the team faltered. Cornell piled on 19 shots to Harvard’s four in the middle frame after falling behind 1-0 in the first.
Two of those attempts were on the money, and came on remarkably similar attempts. Both were power play scores from in front of the net; the first was notched by sophomore forward Cam Donaldson, and the second came from the stick of classmate Tristan Mullins on a net-mouth scramble. The Crimson gave up three penalties in all that period while drawing zero — a considerable blow to a bottom-four penalty-killing team, as Harvard is. This dramatic momentum swing proved too much for the hosts to recover from.
“The second period, I didn’t think we played with a lot of poise,” said head coach Ted Donato ’91. “Took a couple of unnecessary penalties, we got beat back at the front of our net…. They were more determined, certainly, in the second period than we were, and that was the difference in the game.”
In the third period the tables turned somewhat in terms of pressure, as the Crimson outshot the Big Red 10-1 and prevented the visitors from getting a shot on net until over 13 minutes into the frame. Harvard also saw two man-advantage opportunities, the second coming with less than four minutes left in regulation. But it could not convert on either, and pulling Lackey for the extra attacker also proved fruitless.
The Crimson’s lone goal came at the 5:30 mark of the first period, on its very first power play attempt. As the second unit set up, junior forward Colton Kerfoot swept a pass to rookie defenseman Jack Rathbone at the left point. With Harvard skaters screening the Cornell goalie, Rathbone fired a shot that went right through the crowd and to the back of the net. The freshman’s tally extends the man-advantage unit’s streak of eight straight games with a conversion, and keeps its efficiency at the top of the NCAA.
But Saturday’s game also marked the end of several players’ point streaks. Junior defender Adam Fox, the team’s points leader, saw his season-long point streak grind to a halt, while sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh and co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage did not notch a point for the first time in seven and five straight respectively. The offense, however, was not coach Donato’s primary concern after the loss.
“I’m not as concerned about the [lone] goal as I am about our overall effort,” coach Donato said. “You’re not going to win a lot of games with 24 shots. We got the goal early, but we...can’t look in the mirror and say that we played our best or that we deserved to win.”
The Big Red, for its part, turned around its game after last week’s loss. The team has been plagued by the injury bug already this season, with several key contributors unable to dress against the Crimson. One big absence was sophomore goaltender Matt Galajda, who did not play at all this weekend after an injury sustained at Madison Square Garden. Instead, rookie Austin McGrath stepped up between the pipes — and played to his first win, stopping 23 of 24 attempts thrown his way.
At the other end of the ice, Lackey turned in another solid performance (2.08 GAA, .933 SV%). The net-minder has picked up confidence in the past few weeks, and aside from a loss to ASU, has had good numbers for his past six starts. That positive, though not enough to secure a win, is a necessary foundation if Harvard hopes to overcome this stumbling block.
“I thought he was good,” coach Donato said. “I think he gave us a chance to win the game, and that’s ultimately what you need from your goalie. I thought he made some saves in the second to keep the game at 2-1.”
The Crimson will close out its 2018 play with a game at Bentley next week before hosting the Chinese National Development Team in late December. A win on Saturday could have had ranking implications for Harvard — and certainly for Cornell — in addition to boosting the team’s confidence heading into its winter hiatus, but the team will need to look ahead for a satisfying closeout to the year.
