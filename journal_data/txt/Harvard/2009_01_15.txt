President-elect Barack Obama has clearly demonstrated that he knows the stakes when it comes to the economic crisis. In an address on the economy last Thursday, he said, “we need to act boldly and act now to reverse these cycles.”  Regrettably, his proposed action, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan, falls well short of bold. A $775 billion dollar bill  might be the best way to win bipartisan support, but threatens to leave our economy in recession for years, sell the American people short, and tarnish Obama’s presidency.
Obama’s economic team has filed a comprehensive report on ARRP. According to New York Times economist Paul Krugman’s analysis of the report, “the plan would close only around a third of the output gap over the next two years.”  Furthermore, it will only lower unemployment from about 9 percent to 7.5 percent, while the economy’s target unemployment rate, the natural rate, is about 5 percent. By the standards of the president-elect’s own economists, the plan will leave America with high unemployment and a weaker economy.
This economic crisis is widely regarded as the greatest crisis since the Great Depression. Such a crisis dictates leaning toward a stimulus that might be too large, certainly not toward one that is too small. If all goes according to plan, which is a leap of faith in itself, this plan still leaves millions of Americans in the unemployment line. In addition, unemployment statistics present an incomplete picture of unemployment. Job losses are not the only concern, but also the scarcity of job opportunities for people entering the workforce.
Obama considered a stimulus ranging from $800 billion to $1.3 trillion, he said in an interview with CNBC on Jan. 7.  By choosing a stimulus package on the lower end of that range, he avoids a fight with Republicans in the senate. Instead, Democrats like Sen. John Kerry and Sen. Kent Conrad have been critical of the bill.  Obama wants a bill passed with 80 votes, clear bipartisan support,  but that vision has shrunk the bill, rendering it much less effective. As a result, Obama risks alienating his Democratic base. Many Democratic senators have shown clear disapproval about the plan’s size and its emphasis on business tax cuts as opposed to government spending.  Obama’s admirable vision of bipartisanship should not come before what is best for the American people.
A truly effective stimulus plan jolts the economy by lifting consumer confidence, since tax cuts can only increase economic activity when people spend, not save. A bigger plan would undoubtedly lead to more consumer confidence, especially if Obama had been brave enough to break the trillion-dollar mark. The flurry of news headlines and television news stories that would accompany such a big figure would show the public that Obama is serious about bringing up the economy, and hopefully motivate them to spend.
As the plan goes forward, it is important that our money goes to the right places. Obama’s dedication to creating private sector jobs is laudable, and will avoid inflating the public sector. In this way, the jobs he creates in competitive industries will be permanent. Constant oversight of the plan’s funds is necessary to ensure that they are spent as efficiently as possible.
According to the Romer-Bernstein report, the effects of this plan will last until late 2011, with unemployment still 1.5 percent higher than the natural rate.  This stimulus package could define the first term of Obama’s presidency—there is no margin for error.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Neither garlic nor holy water could ward off the country’s taste for vampires this holiday season. The vampire/human couple at the heart of Stephenie Meyer’s wildly successful Twilight book series stole the hearts of preteen girls nationwide—studios rushed to produce a movie version, news magazines splashed headlines like “A New J.K. Rowling?”, and Amazon reported that it had sold enough copies of the fourth “Twilight” book to scale Mt. Everest eight times.
But tucked into this seemingly clear-cut success story is a harrowing prophecy for publishing. After the Twilight series became popular, an early draft of the next book was illegally posted online and downloaded rampantly. Meyer stopped writing the book in protest, much to the horror of her tween fans. 
The publishing industry largely chose to ignore this incident or to brush off Meyer’s response as overreacting, but it should have taken the downloaders seriously. For this episode contains a clear imperative: If books are to remain profitable, publishers must imitate the music industry and see artistic content as a gateway to more profitable ventures. 
Those who downloaded the book are next generation consumers, who see ducking payment for artistic content—CDs, movies, cable TV—as something no more serious than lifting paper cups from the dining hall. They get their songs and movies free and give them freely. Unlike their parents, they’re not fazed by LCD screens; they e-read on their laptops and smart phones more than they read on paper. Why pay $20 for a book, they ask, when you can download it for free? And these consumers will not suddenly become accustomed to buying books as they grow older; instead, they’ll pass this instinct on to their kids.  
So what will happen when people stop purchasing books? If they continue to do nothing, publishers will have to lean on extra-book sources of revenue that already exist. Books will be published because of an author’s book tour charisma or the price their storyline fetches from a film studio or video game maker, rather than for their innovative content. This approach does not bode well for either literature or the industry in the long run, but right now it is the only Plan B in place. 
To avoid this sad scenario, publishers should look to the music industry. Despite the ruckus it is raising over illegal file sharing, record companies have quietly adjusted themselves to the reality of downloading. CDs and MP3s are now only at the surface of what they sell; related products such as concert tours, posters, and ringtones generate a significant cut of the total revenue. In 2008, while album sales fell 14 percent, concert ticket sales rose seven percent. And next time someone’s cell phone goes off to the deepening downbeat of “Disturbia,” consider that 20 percent of Rihanna’s revenue comes from the sale of ringtones. This innovative mentality is saving the music business, without undermining the business of music. 
Publishers must do the same thing to transform books from a dead-end product to a revenue generator. Right now, consumers’ investment in books begins and ends at the Barnes & Noble counter. An average fan of “The Kite Runner” probably wouldn’t watch an online video of author Khaled Hosseini reading out loud, pay money to attend a book signing, or buy a poster of the book. It’s not that they’re against the idea; most of the time, the thought simply hasn’t crossed their mind. 
Promoting this kind of mixed media would therefore be an effective way of revitalizing the book industry, for books have so much potential to go beyond the printed page. Publishers could introduce and market new dimensions of the reading experience—promoting promising authors more exuberantly, or introducing additional online content such as e-discussion groups and original character sketches, for example.
Luckily, the industry has a grace period to make adjustments. Books are in no rush to move online; Amazon is currently the only big e-book publisher. It is tedious to manually scan hundreds of pages, and the new generation of consumers often has homework, finals, or primal screams to attend to. Nevertheless, as the demand for e-books grows, bookstores should watch their backs—someday, you may have to look for your course packs online. You might not even have to wait for someday: students deterred by the price of the $60 Ec 1010a workbook can already download a free copy on Scribd.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama approaches, every single detail of the ceremony has come under intense scrutiny from supporters and critics alike. Of all the minor controversies that have broken out thus far, the selection of Rick Warren, who has been described as “the most prominent evangelical preacher of the post-Billy Graham generation,” to deliver the invocation at this historic event has been by far the most publicized. While some have charged that Obama is merely pandering to the Religious Right, the truth is that Warren’s selection symbolizes Obama’s hopes to move into a post-partisan dialogue for believers and skeptics alike.  
There is no doubt that the Religious Right is a powerful force in American politics. Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska is merely the latest in a long series of political leaders who have exemplified its outspoken and often divisive stands on issues such as gay marriage and abortion. Since the founding of the Moral Majority in 1979, the GOP has managed to link political and religious conservatives in a surprisingly successful electoral strategy based on these “wedge” issues. But in turn, the rise of the Religious Right has deepened the gulf between secularists and believers.   
It hasn’t always been this way. Throughout American history, evangelical Christianity and more progressive political movements have often found themselves intertwined. During the nineteenth century, many who believed in a literal and inerrant interpretation of Scripture fought for an agenda of social progress, including the abolition of slavery and women’s equality. But ever since the late 1970s—when the IRS declined to grant tax-free status to fundamentalist Bob Jones University—many evangelical leaders have become increasingly conservative in their political demands. As a result, in recent years, “religious” has become synonymous with the aims of a few influential leaders in the Republican Party. 
But these religious leaders cannot claim to speak for all Christians. Much of their agenda is either extra-scriptural or plainly illogical. For example, the parts of the Bible that pro-life activists cite to justify their cause are not explicit and can often be interpreted in different ways. “Of course, nothing addresses abortion directly,” concedes Willem A. VanGemeren, a professor of the Old Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. Nor have the champions of the Religious Right bothered to explain how their support for the death penalty or the tragically costly War in Iraq lines up with the Ten Commandments.
Thankfully, some evangelicals—including Warren, the author of “The Purpose-Driven Life”—have tried to change the tone of the debate. In 2004 the National Association of Evangelicals created the “Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility,” which focused on social issues like poverty, AIDS, human rights, and the health of the environment. Other evangelicals—who believe just as strongly in the injunctions of Jesus Christ—have become eloquent spokesmen for the cause of peace.  
If anything, these “new” evangelicals—who may care more about the plight of those suffering from AIDS than the legal ramifications of the latest court case on same-sex marriage—are practicing their faith in a very real way. After all, the Bible is much more forthright and adamant on issues such as peace and poverty than abortion or sexual orientation. As Duke Divinity School professor Richard B. Hays says, “Let us stop fighting one another, for a season, about issues of sexuality, so that we can focus on what God is saying to the church about our complicity in the violence that is the deepest moral crisis of our time.” 
Indeed, there may be a deeper significance to Obama’s selection of Warren. The President-elect’s recent selection of openly gay Episcopal bishop V. Gene Robinson to give an inaugural prayer  suggests that his invitation to Warren is one of mere courtesy, not an endorsement of the evangelical leader’s political views.  In fact, there may be a distinct policy perogative at stake—winning younger evangelicals over to a more progressive position on gay rights. And there is reason for such hope as, despite Biblical injunctions, younger evangelicals are becoming more liberal on these so-called “family-values” issues.
By reaching out to evangelicals on these broader economic and social issues, secular liberals can create a much larger coalition behind a progressive agenda, and evangelicals can feel like they are not compromising the Biblical roots of their faith. In doing so, they should follow the example set by Edward O. Wilson, Pellegrino University Research Professor Emeritus, who has argued forcefully for the inclusion of environmental issues in any evangelical policy agenda. Given the importance of Barack Obama’s inauguration to the entire country, his selection of Warren is an encouraging sign. While Warren’s stances on social issues might understandably alienate some of the President-elect’s supporters, our new president should not waste any time before tackling critical issues like climate change and poverty reduction. Beyond that, a new outreach program may help liberals and progressives to persuade the younger generation of evangelicals to moderate their stance on the divisive but important issues of abortion and gay marriage.  Those who criticize  Warren’s selection are missing a valuable opportunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the most famous tangos of all time, Carlos Gardel sang about “returning, with the withered forehead; the snows of time, silvering one’s temple.”  When it comes to the Cuban Revolution, which has just turned 50, very few people can actually return to those distant days of 1959. Save perhaps the Castro brothers and a meagre number of his septuagenarian ruling elite, we have all been told or have read about Cuba and its revolutionary experience. Regardless of whether we love or loathe them, we must conceive of those memories critically, for they speak as much about Cuba as they do about us.
If something is certain about the revolutionaries that overthrew the pharaonic regime of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba 50 years ago, it is that they managed to change the world—and that they have lasted. Armed more with romantic idealists than ammunition, including men of the calibre of Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara, the guerrilla movement led by Fidel Castro slowly but steadily challenged Batista’s rule in the late 1950s, promising an end to the dismal inequality and extreme poverty in Cuba.  Following their victory, the revolutionaries became symbols of an enduring resistance against America and its values less than 100 miles from U.S. soil. Fidel Castro and his regime have since outlasted 10 U.S. presidents, the fall of the Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping’s market reforms in China, and both the civil rights movement in America and the election of the first African-American president. Despite history, it seems, Cuba marches on.
But what marches on in Cuba and who marches on with Cuba? 
Revolutionary propaganda notwithstanding, the failure of the revolution in Cuba is, at this point, obvious. A dictatorship subservient to the U.S. was replaced by one momentarily subservient to the Soviet Union, and consistently subservient to itself. In a move reminiscent of monarchical succession, Fidel Castro gave up power to none other than his brother Raúl two years ago. Despite the deleterious effects of the economic blockade on the island in place since John F. Kennedy’s administration, the regime’s economic decisions have not created tangible benefits beyond healthcare and literacy. Poverty remains widespread, education limited, and free speech censored; barges still head from Havana to Miami, not the other way around. After the 1990s reforms, Cuba has a dual economy where those who cannot access currency convertible into U.S. dollars cannot afford basic necessities. As a result, incentives are so perverted that one can see women with Ph.Ds driving 1960s vintage cabs in Havana because that is the only way to afford toothpaste and shampoo.  
Moreover, those leaders in Latin America who cite Cuba as their inspiration seem only to be moved by a similar sense of hypocrisy. Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez is a case in point. In honor of the 50th anniversary some days ago, he pledged to fly the Cuban flag forever, next to the mausoleum of Simón Bolívar, a key independence fighter of the 1810s. He said: “Cuba is part of this nation, of this union.”  But in truth, Chávez’s regime is rooted in his desire to perpetuate his own unchecked power to the detriment of democratic institutions. Bolivan President Evo Morales, meanwhile, declared his “respect…and admiration for Fidel,”  at a time when La Paz’s crackdown on political opposition and his economic policies are isolating his country from most foreign markets. Perhaps most tragically, the terrorists of the Colombian FARCs speak of equality, but fund their devious state-within-a-state through cocaine rather than communitarianism.
At the official celebration in Havana on January 1, Raúl Castro warned that, “outside forces cannot destroy the Cuban Revolution.” In a way, he is right: Aggressive but ineffective moves by the U.S. and its allies in the last 50 years, including the blockade, assassination attempts against Castro, and the Bay of Pigs, have only strengthened the autocratic regime. But Castro neglected to mention that there is nothing left to be destroyed but false memories. The Cuban Revolution was destroyed long ago by men like Fidel and Raúl Castro, men who took up the bastion of worthy ideals like education, enlightenment, and opportunities for all only to betray them for their own personal interest. As they became what they most hated, their socialism showed symptoms of the worst kind of individualistic and corrupted ethos. And those around the region who choose to remember a tragic revolution in positive light share a similar duplicity.
When asked in an interview about the greatest revolutionary force, Che Guevara said: “At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love.” Killed in battle, Guevara never got the withered forehead or silvered temple Gardel sang about. But perhaps he was lucky to go, for he was spared the sight of the utmost lack of love his brothers-in-arms, and those who still adulate them, have come to show the world. What marches on in Cuba is thus little more than apocryphal memories in support of hypocrisy.

Harvard is constantly making headlines in its community and surrounding area, but how often do Harvard and its students take note of the headlines around them? With the long-term Allston construction underway we are now, more than ever, intertwined with Boston and its communities. An awareness of what’s right and what’s wrong in those communities must be developed. The law, and the patterns of citizen’s adherence to and breaking of it are constantly changing, and Harvard is affected on some level. From the legal treatment of narcotics to the rights of prisoners; from the safeguarding of a community to the volunteering of role models, Harvard and its talents, resources, and perspectives must consider becoming more permanently involved.

Helen Vendler, Porter University Professor: “I’ve never believed in (or made) resolutions, being too much in favor of day-by-day freedom.  ‘The river glideth at its own sweet will’ (Wordsworth).” Daniel T. Gilbert, Harvard College Professor of Psychology: “I resolved to make only one resolution. And I also resolved to lose 5 pounds.” N. Gregory Mankiw, Beren Professor of Economics: “I resolve to stop responding to queries from The Crimson. (Oops...already broken.)” Howard Georgi ’67, Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics: “I am afraid that my New Year’s resolution is just to make it through February! But more seriously, I have to keep reminding myself to stay positive and look for opportunities even in the difficult economic climate of Harvard today.” Stephen Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology: “Resolutions and commitments of one’s own future behavior are a bit like one person coercing another, except that in this case the present self is trying to coerce the future self. Since Ulysses had his sailors tie him to the mast so he could hear the sirens’ song without steering the ship onto the rocks, people acting in the present have restricted or coerced their future selves for the benefit of those future selves. New Years’ resolutions don’t take the form of physical restraints like tying oneself up, but if the resolution is public, then one puts the credibility of one’s future self at stake – if your future self  blows the resolution, you are calling yourself (your future self, that is) a liar.”

Spring semester is approaching, a new set of Crimson editors is on its way, and Prestige and Mobility’s future is unclear. When we first started writing for FM, we had a list of demands. Although we still haven’t received our secretaries, our sexy secretaries, or our sexetaries, we did get the glass-bottomed hot-air balloon, the collected works of Afroman, and a commemorative photo with Registrar Barry S. Kane. Also, we received that machine which turns pennies into flattened pennies with our Queen Drew Faust’s image pressed on them, and in exchange for 10,000 Faust-marks sterling, UHS has promised to stop asking Vinnie if he’s pregnant, or how that Faust-mark got into his colon before they will treat him. But now, in order to secure our writing career, we give you our prepared pitches for various campus publications.The Harvard Advocate: Since it’s one of the most prestigious and most frequently recycled publications on campus, we would have been honored to have our work in this monument to yellow journalism. Unfortunately, we were turned away for wearing too few scarves and thus were never able to drop off our story about the older man who visited our lemonade stand.THURJ (The Harvard Undergraduate Research Journal): We respect the work you’re doing. Also, we THURJ all the time (sometimes when we don’t even mean to!), so we’re ready to come in strong.The Harvard Lampoon: On second thought…we’d like to withdraw our application; people actually like our jokes.  However, if you’re willing to hand over the keys to the castle, we can talk.College Boxes: We thought this was an opportunity to write a screenplay for a pornographic film, but it actually was just an inept storage company.Freeze College Magazine: Dear FCM, we’re sorry about the mix-up. That application was supposed to go to Diamond Magazine. We know you’re much more interested in “what’s in this winter” than pictures of our dicks.Harvard Medieval Review: In our scholarly opinion, you guys have some really trenchant material and observations. We don’t want to mess that up.Harvard Salient: Bros, you were totally the front runner for our free-wheeling prose until we discovered your comp process involved us getting a gay marriage and then being stoned nearly to death while we recite Obama’s convention speech and you scream racial epithets at us.The Crimson Arts Board: We would love the opportunity to be free from editorial constraints seeing as no one would read us enough to be offended.Harvard Independent: You’d let us say “dickswamp,” right?Satire V: We love how you parody the Crimson’s production schedule by rarely and sporadically publishing issues; we also love your strategy of choosing good Onion articles, taking out words at random, and filling them in like Mad Libs.College Events Board Apology Letter Team: Although members of the CEB seem to only commit five hours a semester to ruining life at Harvard, we assume your damage control is a much greater time commitment, and cannot accept your offer at this time.Our Queen Drew Faust’s Christmas Cards: By bearing Christmas cheer, we can change Harvard from a “republic of Suffering” to a “creation of confederate nationalism” or maybe even a “mother of invention”! We promise to spray your card to Registrar Barry S. Kane with your favorite perfume.Harvard Philosophy Review: Our school of “Nacho Cheesier Thought” is going to be philosophy’s next great wave, and we’re going to boogey board that baby right to the top!Harvard University Women in Business Magazine: We have some more  oxymorons to fill your issue: military intelligence, pretty ugly, liquid gas, and jumbo shrimp.Harvard Economic Review: We sure need a magazine like you guys in this market, right? Are we right? Right? Right!Harvard Voice: We love the free sunglasses and milkshake coupons—call us crazy, but we think that you could soon expand into publishing a newspaper.Now that you know we have some other offers, FM, let’s see if you come around to our idea of full-color Vinnie and Danny paper dolls…with outfits.

As Harvardians duel strangers for library seats and claw at one another to reach the top of the curve, students across town are tackling a different battle. Think “Bride Wars.” On Tuesday evening, the MIT Students Activities Office hosted the seminar “Gay Wedding Planning 101.”As Director of Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgendered services at MIT, Abigail Francis cooked up this guide to getting hitched. “Gay marriage has been on the radar,” explained Francis. Francis was inspired by a “cliché and kitschy” wedding planning class she attended with LBGT students last year. She came away disillusioned, and decided that MIT’s Independent Activities Period in January would be the perfect time to improve on the idea.While Francis’ class covered all the essentials, from color swatches—cream vs. beige—to place settings—linen vs. chiffon, it also targeted some of the weightier issues surrounding gay weddings and aimed to promote understanding about the different set of expectations, sources of support, and vendors for gay ceremonies compared to straight ones.A panel of students and staff spoke about planning their own nuptials. Attendees socialized and nibbled on an array of hors d’oeurves. A spectrum of colorful sticky notes adorned the walls of the room with the attendees’ reasons for coming to the event. One of the main issues? Family Drama. According to Francis, matrimonial festivities can be ideal opportunities for communication between friends and relatives. “This is sometimes an educational moment,” said Francis. “It can be a growth opportunity for people.”And, in keeping with its message of openness, the seminar wasn’t only for MIT students. Marco Chan ’11, co-chair of the Harvard-Radcliffe Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporters Alliance, agreed with its aims. “Discussing the dynamics of a same-sex relationship in an event with traditionally heterosexual context is a really healthy conversation to have,” said Chan.Nathalie P. Galindo ’07, an LGBT Proctor in Stoughton, voiced a similar response. “Being surrounded by diversity and learning to build your wedding helps you feel more comfortable creating a celebration of your love,” she said.Maybe during next year’s new “J-Term,” Harvard students will be attending Gay Wedding Planning 102?

The official themes and hyperbolic rhetoric of presidential inauguration seasons can seem to blend together. Barack Obama’s campaign for change echoes words spoken 16 years ago, when Bill Clinton reminded listeners that our nation requires “dramatic change from time to time. This is our time. Let us embrace it.” Inauguration slogans have ranged from the promising—Richard Nixon’s “Bring us together again”—to the self-congratulatory—James Madison’s “nobility of the American people” or W’s “Celebrating Freedom, Honoring Service.”Obama’s theme, “Renewing America’s Promise,” hints at a different type of inauguration, one looking towards the future with one foot firmly planted in the past. To prepare for the millions who will descend on Washington to experience Obama’s powers of renewal, FM brings those lucky enough to be in the Registrar’s good graces a map to navigate the crowds, balls and bars. National Mall: For the first time ever the entire length of the National Mall will be opened to the public during the inauguration. Formerly a staging ground for the day’s parade, it will be flanked on either side by giant TV screens allowing everyone to view the swearing-in ceremony. But those in attendance should be wary: according to CNN, if the expected 5 million people actually do show up, each person will have approximately one square foot to stand on. Inaugural Balls: Ten official balls will take place throughout the D.C. area, although this spot, the convention center, will house the unprecedented Neighborhood Inaugural Ball, which promises to be a more open and accessible (read: cheap) celebration. Obamamaniacs take note: while the ten balls won’t be the only festivities of the evening, they are the only ones that the Obamas and Bidens are guaranteed to attend.  Bars: Old Ebbitt Bar and Grill, the oldest saloon in Washington, is close to the White House and across the street from the site of Rhodes Tavern, the watering hole where British generals toasted one another as Washington burned in 1812. During the inauguration, however, Washington nightlife will be alive and well: bars will be open all night and serving alcohol until 4 a.m. Museums: In celebration of the election the Smithsonian museums will be featuring presidentially-themed exhibitions, including “Presidents in Waiting”, “President Lincoln’s Inaugural Ball,” and “First Ladies at the Smithsonian.” The Newseum, the only museum fronting the parade route, will open its balconies for viewers.

Harvard students are like dogs, especially during reading period. Not only do they refuse to bathe and eat anything they can get their hands on, but they also do disgusting things to mark their territory. Walk into Lamont on any given weekday, and you’re going to have a hard time finding a seat. You’ll scour the first floor, hope for an open carrel, but walk the length of the room to no avail.  Then you see it, the mark of a Harvard hound: a North Face jacket draped casually over the back of the chair, open books, and a half-eaten bagel cluttering the desk. Yet, conspicuously missing from this scene is any evidence of human life. I understand the frustration of finding a spot in Lamont, but I just can’t empathize with those of you who save seats for hours on end. What could you possibly be doing for ten hours? Impromptu trips to the country? All-day marathons of America’s Next Top Model? Trying to show your TFs other “talents” to make up for the fact that you’re not studying? While you’re out cavorting, I’m forced into one of the overstuffed chairs, a hot laptop on my legs, trying to balance three books with two hands. Enough is enough. The next time you can’t find a seat in Lamont, don’t be afraid to toss that half-eaten bagel in the trash and mark your own territory. If someone comes back to claim the carrel, do not panic. Give them the call number for Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species” (QH365.O2 1859a, fyi) and direct them to the part about “survival of the fittest.” Should this tactic fail, you can always just bare your teeth and go for the throat.

My biggest problem living with a Maasai family in Tanzania was not the roof made of sticks and cow shit that I slept under nightly. It was actually the nightly war against my homestay sister for space on the family cowhide where we slept. I would settle down as best I could and try to create some semblance of personal space among the five other people in bed (when I say bed, think sticks, cow hide and a log as your pillow). But my homestay sister Monika had no qualms about pushing me, punching me, kicking me or spooning me. And it didn’t take long before I learned to push back. With Monika’s arm around me, and two sharp elbows at my disposal, I managed to hold my ground. Come November, when the rains began, I would be long gone, but Monika would still be sleeping there as the rain pounded down outside the hut. It would be her first rainy season as a woman. Monika took me on as her responsibility almost immediately upon my arrival in the village of Ngare Sero (which means “Mountain of God” in the local language of Kimaa). She picked me up from the office of the village Chairman, covered me in jewelry, and from that moment on, I was hers. During my week in Ngare Sero, Monika dressed me, bathed me and explained why the young warrior men would swing their dreadlocks in our faces when we went out dancing. Each day, I accompanied Monika on her daily routine: walking to collect water, gathering firewood, and cooking for the family. Though Monika could not have been more than 14 years old, she was a woman, and perfectly capable of her responsibilities, which included me. I, on the other hand, at 20 years old, was considered to be merely a child.  In Maasai culture, boys and girls are not considered adults until they have gone through the appropriate procedures of circumcision. Once circumcised, everything in their lives changes. Villagers knew that Monika was a woman simply because of the words she used to greet people. I seemed to be the only person in the village who did not consider my pre-pubescent homestay sister to be an adult.  One hot afternoon, Monika broached the subject of her womanhood by asking me if I knew what the word “kutahiriwa” meant. I did not. If you look the word up in a Swahili dictionary, you will see that it means circumcision. But when Monika explained it, using diagrams and elementary Swahili, she told an elaborate story of her ceremonious transition into womanhood. Monika beamed with pride as she told of her experience. She pointed to the hut behind us, where her grandmother had performed the surgery. It was there that Monika learned about marriage, motherhood, and the practices and obligations of being a Maasai woman. I cringed and asked her about the pain, which she brushed off with nonchalant stoicism. Monika answered all my questions with ease, even excitement, explaining that she had wanted to be circumcised, had completely healed within a month and was thrilled with the outcome. But I could not provide a satisfying answer to her question for me: why was I still a child, and when would I become an adult? Picture this: two young women, one Tanzanian and one American, both dressed in Maasai traditional clothing (something resembling five layers of red blankets and an exorbitant amount of beaded jewelry), both talking about the same process, but one with a sense of ultimate pride and the other with a mix of apprehension and confusion. I had studied and discussed female circumcision before my time in Tanzania. I had debated what to call it—female genital mutilation, genital cutting, circumcision, etc. I had weighed the pros and cons of human rights versus cultural relativism. But never had I sat with a young girl who so had been recently circumcised, and heard her perspective on the experience as she drew an “x” on paper to diagram the cutting.  I do not support invasive female circumcision procedures that take place against a girl’s will. But after listening to Monika, I came to see her experience as a positive one. We make sweeping assumptions about female circumcision, regarding it as a horrific affliction to women, and there’s no doubt that it can be. But, speaking as a feminist, I do not think that female circumcision has to be just that.  I realize that some women reading this article, many of whom have stood up against female circumcision in defense of women’s rights, will disagree with me. But I believe that our Western intervention into the affairs of Maasai women, though well intentioned, is the true act of disempowerment towards the Maasai culture. As long as this coming-of-age process is important and cherished  among Maasai women, I think we could benefit from accepting its significance before berating its existence.  Perhaps this is my coming-of-age story, as I have returned from studying abroad in Tanzania. I can appreciate Monika’s womanhood because I have learned about it and experienced it through her voice. As I lie down at night under a roof not made of sticks and cow shit, on a bed that doesn’t include cowhide, I realize that my own womanhood may mean something different to me than it does to Monika.  My womanhood is one of many, none better and none worse.

"Obama ist mein Kandidat” reads the newspaper in the stands. I’ve stopped to visit a friend in Berlin on my way to Madrid, and all around me these words are emblazoned above a photo of Hillary Clinton. “Man, I hope he wins for a couple of reasons,” I think, convinced my experience with Europeans would hinge upon his victory.Upon my arrival in Spain, I followed the election eagerly, like so many around the world. But for the time being, it’s just far-off news. What’s been put in front of my face steals my attention: the graffiti on the walls of the Political Science Facultad at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. It is mostly ugly, and come to think of it, the walls themselves, in addition to most structural features located therein, are pretty ugly.My classes began at 6:30 p.m., so I would typically approach its hulking, rectangular silhouette in the nighttime. Perhaps I’d slip into the cafeteria first. On my left would be a poster of a young man name Carlos, admonishing its readers to “Continue the Fight.” The poster presumably depicts Carlos Javier Palomino, a young anti-fascist stabbed to death by a member of the extreme right on his way to a protest in a subway station the year prior. Continuing to scan the walls, I’d catch some of the building’s finer graffiti: cartoon people riding along on conveyor belts on their way to prison, for example. All around me would be smoke and chatter, as scarf-clad brunettes sipped the famous corn syrup-free European Coke, cafés con leche, or the beer on tap. After doing my best to participate nonchalantly in one of these activities for a while, I’d slink off to class, a few minutes too early.If one is willing to sacrifice respiratory health, meeting Spaniards is exponentially easier. I learned this my very first day, when I met Patricia. As we both waited in class, long before the professor would arrive, she invited me into the hallway for a smoke. Patricia’s severe face was framed by long dreadlocks, and her baggy outfit announced that she probably had more important concerns than clothes. Fumbling around for a lighter, we exchanged the usual first-time banter. “I’m from the States, live in Massachusetts but grew up in California, took a few Spanish classes, am an Obama fan, and study Social Studies (Inevitably, ‘¿Qué es eso?’).” She was in her fifth and final year of studies and spent much of her time working in a battered women’s shelter. Our exchange was cut short by the professor’s arrival, and I sighed in relief because my pathetic hand-rolled cigarette had gone out and I wasn’t about to ask for the lighter again. My relief was brief. I embarked on the first of many biweekly white-knuckle rides, in which my alarmingly Zach Braff-esque professor managed to make his lectures sound like a single ninety-minute long Spanish word.Fast-forward a few months to Election Day, although it was already evening in the brightly lit classroom. The professor bustled in, characteristically tardy, and turned to me, the only American. He exchanged some thoughts about the election, saying that I must be excited, asking if I’d voted. His speedy mumbling had become much more intelligible to me at this point, but I was still sweating a little from the attention.“And the electoral system? It just doesn’t make any sense.” He offered a series of condescending observations as I squirmed in my seat. “Why don’t you do something about it?”“Well, um, a few states have adopted proportional systems?” I began feebly, trying to keep track of all his complaints, but by then he had lost interest.I was indignant. For the first time in my life, I was an indignant American! I was wholly caught up in the election fervor, and his snarky attitude, usually not much worse than my own, was completely unacceptable under the circumstances. A few of my already few classmates gave me commiserating looks as I coped with these new feelings, which led me to watch CNN on my laptop all night (and maybe also tear up while watching the acceptance speech with my American flatmates at the breakfast table the next morning).Now it is the last day of class. I am shivering outside the behemoth shadow of the Facultad with friends and classmates from Spain, Mexico, Italy, and Virginia. We are waiting for the bus and talking politics again, this time about Mexican elections and the trouble the foreigners are in for not having packed. Though we’ve come here with the wildly different frames of reference you’d expect from such an assortment, and even when my left is someone else’s right we have a lot to say to each other these days.The prevailing attitude toward the United States has ridden the familiar roller coaster over the course of the semester, with more scowls when the economy took a dive and more chummy pats on the back when Obama turned the country blue. A man in Morocco even did me the courtesy of reciting the first minute of one of Obama’s primary victory speeches when he found out I was American (he may have also wanted us to eat dinner at his stall).But here and now, neither the news nor the “prevailing opinion” are any matter. We promise to visit Carlos in Mexico sometime in the hazy future. My bus pulls up, and the farewell confusion sets in. Spaniards kiss twice. I still attempt a hug. We fumble through our affectionate gestures of choice, and I wave a gloved hand as my bus rattles away from the monstrous building for the last time.

As I did my most Baudelaire flâner up the tree-lined Avenue Kléber through the sixteenth arrondissement in Paris, the Eiffel Tower at my back did little to deaden the pangs of hunger in my stomach. Fresh off my flight from home, I had been promptly abandoned by my numbingly French host family and had bravely ventured out in search of my first French meal. Unfortunately, in this astronomically expensive and quite residential quartier, baguette sandwiches with camembert or jambon simply do not abound.After an inordinate number of blocks, I could sense the blisters begin to burgeon on my heels. There I was in the City of Lights, which I had always planned to eat my way through, without a boulangerie, patisserie, or marché in sight. But I quickly forgot why I ever believed such joints were necessary when I discovered Mecca itself: La Maison du Chocolat. Too hungry to focus on row after row of ganache, truffle, or caramel, I proceeded directly to the macaron counter and promptly ordered an individual-size framboise from behind the glass.This coaster-size sandwich of chocolate-raspberry filling squeezed between two rose-colored raspberry meringue wafers should be illegal. But it’s not, especially not in France where the likes of master macaron-makers Pierre Hermé and Ladurée have raised this confection to the nationally emblematic status it deserves. That jumbo macaron was all I ate that day, but it didn’t matter—I was officially obsessed with any way of life that facilitated consumption of these suckers on a regular basis.The true Italian in me was determined to dislike the French from the moment I stepped into the living museum that is Paris. After a week of spontaneous picnics in the Jardin du Luxembourg, afternoon jogs beneath the Eiffel Tower and walks at dusk across the Pont Neuf, I told my dad over Skype that Paris would be the most amazing place in the world if we could just get rid of the French. He suggested that such negativity was perhaps not the key to optimizing my experience, so I tried hard to change my tune. Yet, amidst the riddling systems that structure quotidian life in Paris, my American sensibility and logic left me wondering what this cultural mentality was really all about.Mon exemple préféré: working out. In response to my obligation to morning croissants, I resolved to break a sweat each day by running. My scenic jog took me from my apartment in the sixth arrondissement past dead Napoleon I and the golden dome of Invalides, around mounted policemen practicing at École Militaire, and up and back the Champs du Mars. I quickly noticed that, by and large, I was alone in my athletic pursuits on the streets of Paris until I reached some form of organized green: the French would not be caught dead running in the street, not to mention sporting conspicuously American gym shorts and sneakers in the metro. This was not New York. People do laps of the Jardins day and night, but where the hell were they en route to the park? How else was I supposed to get there? I couldn’t very well teleport myself or something when everyone else seemed to arrive dressed to be sportif.When the weather turned too gray and rainy to rationalize running outside, I joined a gym. It was inconspicuously nestled at the back of a Hausmannian building on the rue de Rennes. This ex-pat in search of a good ol’ American gym complete with sweat and bad pop music found herself in a bastion of French regimentation reminiscent of both the public university system and local fromagerie. It was monitored by conseillers du sport—workout counselors—who suggested suitable speed, weight, and water consumption to gym goers. The gym enforced strict rules: two minute showers, no personal belongings in the workout room, and shorts on men only (not an official rule, but I was the only girl in shorts).As with my gym, there’s an awful lot of structuring that goes on within both French culture and language. Understanding lingual differences through translation is a direct clue to a culture’s mentality. For example, in French, one fait un rêve—makes or does a dream—in English, you simply have one. The expression faire un rêve provides the quintessential example of the active nature of the French cultural mentality: in the French mindset, you invent, design, and construct your own dream in all its organized and aesthetic beauty. We, as Anglophones, experience dreams passively: visions appear to us in spontaneous splendor. In attempting to deconstruct the mystery behind the fickleness of French, I came to appreciate Paris not an aesthetic marvel better off without its inhabitants but as a physical manifestation of French culture itself. Paris is the French.Various aspects of Parisian life continue to baffle me (namely the absurd Laundromat prices and taxing public library system.) But one’s first macaron à la rose at Pierre Hermé, a sunny afternoon at Sainte Chapelle, or the escargot at Robert et Louise in the Marais are absolutely and singularly French. And I’m happy to sit back and dream on.

The small city of Puri sits in the state of Orissa, an eight-hour train ride down the coast from Kolkata. For the past two months Orissa has been in the papers for arson, intimidation, murder, and forced conversion  of its Christian population with the tacit support of the Hinduist state government. This fact has no bearing on my experience of the place, in fact it took part in a very different part of the state. It is provided solely as the context every up-on-the-news Indian might have.Puri is a both a beach town, and a temple town. The beach stretches wide and sandy along a rather temperamental section of the Bay of Bengal; discouraging me from entering beyond knee-high. Nonetheless, a quiet gap in which to settle with a book was tough to find amongst the Bengali holiday-makers, at least in this festival time. The temple, meanwhile, honors Lord Jagannath—an iteration of Vishnu whose form, along with his two brothers’, is pulled through the streets in a 45-foot-high chariot each July by thousands of devotees. The festival is also the original source of the word “juggeraut.”Unfortunately my visit to Puri fell far wide of this celebration, and since the temple complex at Puri is closed to non-Hindus, I could only gaze within its walls from the roof of a local “private library.” And so I entered one of the more common and less insidious types of little scams to be pulled on tourists in India.For the privilege of ascending to the roof, the director expects a “donation” to the library and pulls out a book listing tourists, their host countries, and contributions ranging from 100 rupees (about $2) to 1000 ($20) or more. The solicitor, however, with a little convincing, yields to an offer of 10 rupees for the roof view even as nobody in the book has ostensibly had the gall to offer so little. On reflection, I’m sure zeroes will be added following the “10” I mark in the book in order to make it appear to the next traveler that nobody would insult the library with an offer of so small a sum, just as it was supposed to appear to me. (It’s tough to remember at one’s intent to write the sum in cursive to avoid doctoring, when faced with all the numerals above it).The priests/tour guides of a temple in Kolkata pulled this scam as well, although theirs took a more insidious form as they separated me and my fellow traveler to bless us each in turn and then solicit a “donation” for the temple charity with the same book full of past 1,000 rupee and 500 rupee donations. Perhaps I’m cold-hearted, but based on the various forms of used car salesman pressure applied I feel confident in my skepticism of this “charitable” endeavor: I was stopped from approaching my friend while he was blessed lest I wisen him to our first encounter of this scam, I was asked when I offered only 50 why I couldn’t maybe give 100, and I was told that only 1500 rupees (about $30) would buy one bag of rice.Travel scams take many other forms. I hoped, in this short piece, to describe how Puri—apparently a former stop on something called the “hippie trail” back in ancient history—had a particularly bizarre tout culture (“tout” is apparently a Briticism used for those who offer dodgy and difficult-to-evade street-corner guidance to foreigners). My first morning wandering the beach a man offered to arrange a trip for me in the canoe of a fisherman from the local village—an “authentic” experience recommended in some guidebooks. When I declined my new friends offer, he wondered instead if I might not like to buy some hash. I’d been offered hash in Delhi and Kolkata too, but the frequency of offers in Puri, (including from one especially loony rickshaw-wala), when in fact the sparse Western crowd seemed a bit tame, made me wonder if “high season” had permanently departed the town (or at least its backpacker quarter, the Indian holiday business seemed to be thriving).In Kolkata the scams had carried their own character—providing a bottle of water whose cap had already been unsealed and claiming “I just did that myself, sir” proved popular even in decent restaurants. The next destination of my journey, Bodhgaya—the spot of Buddha’s enlightenment—would house its own flavor of touts. “You think I want money; I just guide people for good karma of helping. What are you looking for?”“Umm... enlightenment. Now jayo, bhaya: get out of here.”An eight-year old kid in Bodhgaya latched onto my friend and I. Chutto told us he wanted to practice his English, and he took us to his family’s one-room hut, adjacent to the tent restaurant we were eating in and showed us his schoolbooks. Then he asked us if we wouldn’t buy him a football so he could play like the other kids.He followed us to the bookstores we were heading towards clearly seeking a commission should we buy anything, and he tried to kick a young girl who attempted to beg from us while we were under his sway, his juicy catch. The kid had launched on the path of the tout, and to encourage him could only in the long run lead him away from the school and toward the domain of the loitering young men barking out “Where are you going? What you want?”

You ever heard of that book, “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,” by James Joyce? That’s like our lives.
“What?” You might ask. I’ll tell you what. Shut up.
We’re artists. One might call us jokesters, magicians, or funny men. 
You          don’t believe it? Deal. This is our endpaper—NOT YOURS! We were asked to write it, and you are just going to have to live with it for at least 800 words.
Maybe 700 if we include lots of lengthy exclamations that don’t mean anything. Like this: Blaarrrrrrggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now that we understand each other, let us introduce ourselves. We’re Max and Walt, Movie Producers. Or at least aspiring ones. Oh, you think we aren’t cool? Uhh, well, you see those two righteous dudes over there, yeh, right next to this story? That’s us. Thank you for the apology, we won’t destroy you now.
Hey, we got a question for you all out there in dreamland: do you know where movies come from? Uteri, originally, but after that? Dragons. Dragons who make beautiful, beautiful babies. Of art.
We’ve been dismayed lately. We’re seeing so many of our fellow seniors at Harvard literally losing their minds about jobs, consulting, investment banking, saving the world. Last week, our friend bought a Venus flytrap and cut off its head. Just to teach it a lesson. That crazy.
So here’s our remedy—the creative process.
Call it the Huber-Howell project, and we’re ready to drop some D’s on this hoe. If you want to ride on this pain train, betta buy yo ticket. For $9.95. No C.O.D.’s. Twenty dollar value!
Check these ideas that we’ve got coming out of the proverbial pipeline, the proverbial pooper shooter. Just sit back and sip on a little Juicy Juice while sucking on our mind grapes!
Let’s talk shop: 
Movie #1: Vampires v. Zombies
To begin, a shoutout because we can. Our good friend, Roberto Padwan, helped us with this glorious conception. This guy is such an artist, you would probably crap your pants if you saw him. And his words? Oh, they would explode your mind grapes. So he’s not writing. You’re welcome.
FYI, this movie will be more epic than anything ever created ever, including, but not limited to, kicking the butt of BOTH the Holy Bible and Twilight. Suck it Stephenie Meyer. But, still, Go Jesus!
Imagine a world, a world much like this one, where vampires are living among us, out in the open (like True Blood, but better). Vampires comprise the highest echelons of society. Warren Buffet: vampire. Kofi Annan: vampire. Tom Brady: vampire. Booyah.
But this ain’t no crazy-ass vampires that can survive on animal blood. (Suck it, Stephenie Meyers, again!) Keeeeyyyyyahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They need human blood. The humans are like their cattle. Hence, a symbiotic relationship in this Brave New World is forged.
But then, you see, this one day, zombie invasion!
That’s right, they start infecting everyone, making humans UNDRINKABLE!
Solution: I think you know. Vampire plus human swat team to destroy all them zombies. And let’s just say something right here: the apocalypse never looked so cool.
The cast: Lead vampire: James Franco. Lead human: the Rock. Lead zombie: Your mom. Am I right??? 
Movie #2: Poodle Overload!
This, my friends, is our tour de force. Our magnum opus. Our eggs benedict, if you will.
Psyche! It’s better than that.
Imagine a world where poodles are literally everywhere. They’re in your bathtubs, in your back yards, in your local pet retailer shop. Pretty scary, right?
That’s what we thought. Then we doubled it. Then brought it to life.
Prepare to shart your pants, oh world out there, because this train is off its tracks, and IT’S NOT FUNNY!
For the residents of one small Missouri town, overrun totally with poodles, Poodle Day is not just one day of the year. It’s every day of the year.
We’re talking poodles everywhere, so many that normal capital functions are not functioning. Banaarrrraaannnnggggggggggggggg!!!!!
Like, people go to start their car for work, but they can’t. It’s a problem.
Enter Skulls McTavish, a rebel with a cause—poodle ass-kicking. This rugged, Mad Max-style savage takes prisoners and doesn’t even ask for their names.
He’s got a cool car and a cool leather jacket. Hello, Freeze College Magazine. Get on this, or prepare to die.
The cast: Skulls Mctavish: Max Huber. Love interest: Kate Winslet. Poodles: Yale. 
OK. So we know that right about now, you probably thinkin’, “Max and Walt, those movies are like, the dumbest things, I have heard. Like dumber than dining hall lentil stew.” But these are difficult times,  and what we want to leave you with is the importance of taking time to just put down that job interview, and let whatever you’re thinking ride onto the paper. We’re talkin’ make some art happen. Squeeze those mind grapes and produce some delicious, tangy art-wine.  
We have other films in the works but you’re going to have to wait. That shiz is classified.
Only those who truly believe in the Revolution (that is, our revolution) will see it, and you’re going to think they’re hilarious. And once you read them, send us your feedback to our e-mail addresses, if you can find them. They’re hidden inside a lockbox. Inside your butt.

The Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library acquired a substantial collection of materials in December centered around the musical, acting and political career of renowned Panamanian salsa singer Rubén Blades.Blades graduated from the Harvard Law School in 1985, and ran for the Panamian Presidency in 1994. He is currently Panama’s outgoing minister of tourism.The collection adds significantly to the library’s Latino music collection that has in recent years lagged  behind collections of African or East Asian musical history.“There’s been a growing interest in Latino music, and this acquisition is an important step in that direction,” said Donna M. Guerra, the curatorial assistant in the archive of world music.Included in the collection are rare recordings of rehearsals and concerts, personal papers, interviews, and books. In addition, campaign posters, newspaper clippings and magazines document Blades’s political activism in Panama.Guerra said that “these rare, one of a kind items” may be placed in a special exhibition in the library, but the entire collection may take up to five years to be catalogued.“These are irreplaceable, so ultimately their access will be limited for research uses,” Guerra said.Alison Weinstock, who created a Web site that catalogs Blades’s music, is coordinating the acquisition on the singer’s behalf. Weinstock originally approached Widener Library about holding the collection, but ultimately the work—which is primarily composed of musical artifacts—was placed in the Loeb archives.“The Loeb is a perfect home for his work,” Weinstock wrote in an e-mail. “I think the Loeb Library and Harvard are uniquely suited to the depth, breadth and variety of his work.”Blade was not available for comment yesterday.

For Harvard seniors anxious about securing a job, at least one new position has opened up: managing Britney Spears’ Facebook page.A Harvard alumni who is in charge of Spears’s digital media and online properties recently sent an e-mail to a private list-serve of Harvard alumni from California looking for a “social media guru” to oversee Spears’ presence on YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter.The news that the job posting had been sent over a Harvard e-mail list quickly made the rounds on celebrity blogs. Joanna Douglas, a columnist for a Yahoo.com entertainment Web site, questioned whether such a job calls for a Harvard diploma.“While we can’t blame Britney for taking extra care with her public image these days, does it really take a high-priced, Ivy League degree to update your Facebook status?” she said. Joseph M. Nejman ’03—the founder of Brandcasting Unlimited, Spears’ online media firm—defended the decision. He sent the job posting to the private e-mail list, he said, because using an alumni network is an effective way to fill a job.“I never said it had to be Harvard,” he said.  Nejman added that Brandcasting is just looking for someone with the right skill set—“and someone with a lot of free time,” he said.Spears’ and several other celebrities’ Twitter accounts were hacked last week.The job description sent out in the e-mail said that the social media guru would be responsible for an array of duties, including driving traffic from exclusive photos and videos, managing the social networks’ traffic reports and membership data, and analyzing community activity and conversation to advise content strategy and brand positioning.Nejman said the job would likely require more than 40 hours a week.He said he thought Spears’ decision to hire someone to manage her online presence was not unusual.“I think the majority of high profile celebrities aren’t spending their time everyday updating their profile pages” or “responding to fans,” he said. After getting numerous e-mails from his friends about the job posting, Peter C. Shields ’09 said he applied for the job.“I sent in my resume because it’s probably the only thing I’m qualified to do,” he said, calling himself a Spears “devotee.”It sounds like the “easiest, stupidest job in the entire world,” he added. “I didn’t really understand why they were looking for a Harvard student.”—Staff writer Eric P.

Harvard Law School professor Howell E. Jackson will assume the school’s top post upon the United States Senate’s confirmation of Law School Dean Elena Kagan as U.S. Solicitor General, University President Drew G. Faust announced today.
Kagan, who has led the Law School since 2003, was named President-elect Barack Obama’s nominee for solicitor general last week. Kagan’s confirmation hearing has not yet been scheduled.
Jackson, whose research focuses on financial regulation, has been a member of the Law School’s faculty since 1989 and was associate dean for research and research programs from 2001 to 2003. After Kagan rose to the deanship in 2003, he took over the role of vice dean for budget until 2006. Jackson currently serves as the chair of the Law School’s lateral appointments committee.
“Howell Jackson is a first-rate scholar and teacher who has been a core member of the Law School’s leadership team in recent years,” Faust said in a statement. “We are fortunate to be able to turn to a prospective acting dean who not only is a distinguished academic, but also has deep experience with the School’s administrative and financial matters and a close working knowledge of the ambitious initiatives the School has been pursuing.”
Kagan’s imminent departure from the Law School coincides with an estimated 22 percent decline in the University’s endowment in a four-month period earlier this year. The Law School has not yet made public its budgetary outlook, and it is uncertain whether, as acting dean, Jackson will make an announcement regarding the impact of the shrinking endowment.
“I am honored that President Faust has asked me to be available to serve the Law School and its extraordinary community of faculty, students, and staff during this transitional time,” Jackson said in a statement.
Jackson praised Kagan’s leadership of the Law School in an e-mailed statement, saying that he hoped to maintain the institutional changes for which Kagan has won acclaim from faculty and students alike. 
“We have a fantastic faculty and a terrific student body,” he said. “My goal is to continue this momentum over the next few months until a permanent dean can be chosen.”
Jackson has been mentioned as a possible permanent successor to the dean’s office. 
Several of Jackson’s colleagues commended his appointment in a time of economic turmoil, citing his experience with the intricacies of Law School finances.
“He’s someone who could have started doing the job yesterday,” said Law School professor Louis E. Kaplow, who also said that Jackson had the potential to be a successful permanent dean if selected.
Calling Jackson a “wonderfully decent human being,” Law School professor Richard H. Fallon said he expected Jackson to share Kagan’s ability to hold the respect of a sometimes-contentious faculty that had given Harvard the moniker of “Beirut on the Charles” at one point.
Jackson attended Brown before receiving a joint degree from Harvard Business School and the Law School in 1982. After graduating, Jackson clerked for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.
As an academic, Jackson’s research focuses on financial regulation and budget policy. Jackson has advised the United States Treasury Department and the World Bank, among other government agencies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a faculty member of the University of Chicago in the early 90s, poet Elizabeth Alexander worked closely with President-elect Barack Obama, whom she regarded as unusually brilliant.
“He was someone who was very warm, committed, who was unusually keen and charismatic and an unusually curious human being,” she said. 
Now Alexander has been chosen to read an “occasional poem” at Obama’s inauguration next week.
“There is no event as momentous as this in [my] past,” Alexander said. “This really is sui generis, it’s own thing.”
A former Radcliffe fellow and Cambridge resident, Alexander has composed an original work for an event that represents the end of an arduous political journey and a milestone in America’s racial history.
“I recognize the excellence in this extraordinary African American elected to the highest office of the land,” she said. “The day comes with a lot of hopes and feelings and sweat and the blood of millions of people.”
Given the expectations on her shoulders, Alexander said that the best she can do is to stay calm and collected.
“I’m just trying to stay very quiet and focused until we come to the day itself,” she said. “The occasion is literally unimaginable.”
As current Radcliffe fellow and National Poet of Wales Gwyneth Lewis said, “Poems don’t come if you put pressure on yourself, and this has to be the most pressurized commission that anybody could imagine...she must feel exposed as well as invigorated.”
Alexander, incoming chair of the African American Studies Department at Yale, has published five books of poems, one of which was a 2006 Pulitzer prize finalist. 
Exposed to politics at a young age—her father was a civil rights adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson—Alexander has used her prowess with words to write about race, class, and gender. 
“I find poets are very interesting people who look at the world from their own particular points of view and are always surprising with language,” she said. 
“That’s what I like about poets: their independence, their free-spiritedness.”
Alexander highlighted Obama’s similar ability to wrangle with words, saying that his book “Dreams of My Father,” which she has taught in a class at Yale, was a “real” book and extraordinary American narrative.
“That care with words really is a reflection of his understanding for the importance of communicating clearly and precisely to get the job done.”
For those students and writers searching for poetic direction, she said that reading is of the utmost importance.
“Never forget that in reading, you’re seeing the things you want to make, made beautifully,” she said. “[Also remember] that being a poet is not something you choose because you want a career, it’s something you choose because you have to and you’re called to make art.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Answer: A Harvard senior who makes his game-show debut on Jeopardy! next Thursday and miffs host Alex Trebek.
Question: Who is Christopher R. Schleicher ’09?
While Schleicher cannot divulge if he won—“They reserve the right to ruin my life and take my first-born child if I say how I did”—he did share that he and Trebek didn’t exactly get along. 
Trebek asked Schleicher, who is co-president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, about the organization during the contestant interview segment of the show.
Schleicher said he wanted to mock the traditional displays of modesty in this segment.
“People are like, 'Oh yeah, I’m a rocket scientist and like a brain surgeon, but you know, I think I’m a really down-to-earth person,'" Schleicher said. “But I just kept claiming I was really popular, charming, and good-looking.”
Schleicher said he didn’t think the iconic host appreciated the irony in his pompousness.
“Trebek was horrified,” he said.
A TRIVIAL PURSUIT
Even before this fall, trivia has held a constant presence in Schleicher’s life throughout his undergraduate years.  Troy C. Murrell ’09, who met Schleicher when the two were freshmen, said that they used to do New York Times crossword puzzles and play Trivial Pursuit. Last summer, they took a team to trivia night at Charlie’s Kitchen.  
Schleicher said they were sure they would win but ended up in second-to-last place. The team returned until finally, at the end of the summer, they tasted victory.
Before he started preparing, Schleicher and friends already had a tradition of watching Jeopardy! and shouting the answers.
“He’s gotten every single question right and faster than everyone on TV,” said Robert I. Padnick ’09, who is also co-president of the Lampoon.
In the spring, Schleicher and a few friends qualified for in-person tests and interviews after taking the initial online test.
This fall, Schleicher got the invite to be on the show. Initially he was “shaky and emotional,” then excited as he called his friends who had also taken the written test: “I bragged my face off to them.”
But then Schleicher became nervous about the task of learning “everything in the world.”
He sought help for his weakness in sports facts and started watching more Jeopardy! than ever before—up to three episodes a day.
Schleicher said concentrating in English probably helped a lot, but many of his answers—or rather, questions—came from information he has acquired by chance.
ANSWERING FOR BURRITOS
Though he couldn’t give away the content, Schleicher said he happened to read about one of the answers on Wikipedia right before he went to sleep the night before the taping.
“I think it made me look really smart,” he said. “Really I was just good at being on the Internet.”
In contrast with watching with his friends, Schleicher said that trying to respond before Trebek finishes reading the answer locks your buzzer out for a few seconds. 
He also said that when no one rings in, it’s not necessarily because they don’t know the answer. 
“There’s a lot of risk aversion,” Schleicher said, adding that he would imagine how many burritos he could buy with the dollars hinging on a question.
Schleicher, who performs with the improv comedy troupe On Thin Ice and the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, plans to get back on TV and start making money as soon as the six-month period, during which Jeopardy! stipulates he cannot compete on other shows, is over.
For now, though, the Winchester, Mass. native and former competitive figure skater hopes to get back to enjoying the show in front of a TV screen—starting next Thursday night, when he will watch himself compete.
“I’m hoping for a lot of Facebook wall posts the next day, ‘I didn’t know you were on Jeopardy! I saw you yesterday.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two local professors of history warmed up the sub-freezing Wednesday evening and brought listeners back to 18th century Boston with a lively reading of their collaborative novel at the Harvard Book Store.
Jill Lepore, a Harvard professor of American history, read several passages  from her new fiction book, “Blindspot,” discussed its historical background, and signed books along with co-author Jane Kamensky, also a professor of American history at Brandeis University.
The historical romance-mystery story follows the arrogant Scottish painter Stewart Jameson and Fanny Easton, a fallen woman from a powerful Boston family who disguises herself as a defiant boy named Francis Weston.
“We left the political story more backstage to focus on ordinary people,” Lepore said. “We wanted to show that the ordinary humble citizens weren’t waiting around for the Revolution to descend on their heads. They’re busy deciding: What’s for dinner?”
The novel alternates between Jameson’s memoir and Fanny’s letters. The two are also interspersed with articles from the Boston Gazette, a Revolutionary War-era newspaper. Blindspot, which was released in December, is written in “two predominant voices, by two authors,” Kamensky said.
Lepore, who was responsible for developing Jameson’s character, explained that the story was written first over weekly e-mail exchanges. Then, after the two protagonists finally met in person, so too did the authors, at each other’s houses over cups of tea.
“It’s a book full of life, sex, and dirty jokes,” Kamensky said.
“Historians gone wild. That’s us,” she added later, drawing laughter from the audience.
Writing in fiction was a significantly different experience from writing in the academic discipline, Kamensky noted. “There was a point where we—and I mean Jill—wanted to footnote every little historical detail that we knew. And finally we stopped that.”
Lepore and Kamensky have known each other since childhood and attended the same graduate program at Yale, according to Lepore. 
“We both ended up in Cambridge and had kids at the same time,” she said, adding that the narrative was originally intended as a birthday present for a mutual friend. 
The event left many listeners wanting to learn more. 
“I enjoyed hearing them explain the epistolary and picaresque forms and how they merged the two in a historical setting,” said Emily A. Click, assistant dean of ministry studies at Harvard Divinity School, referring to the novel’s mix of prose and letters.
Estimating the event’s attendance to be around 50, the bookstore’s marketing manager and organizer of the event, Heather L. Gain, called the book reading “a success, especially for 12 degrees [outside].”
After the discussion, wine was served in the children’s section as “a nice touch to facilitate conversation,” Gain said.

TA: Who I want as Commencement speaker? Oh God…
RR: Come on, you can think of someone.
TA: Well, I wouldn’t mind Conan O’Brien to come back again, I’d be okay with that. No, actually, I would love to have Stephen Colbert as my first choice.
RR: Can you think of anyone who would be even more hilarious than Colbert?
TA: I would love to have George Bush. George Bush is my #1.
RR: Okay, gimme reasons.
TA: Well, he’d be cheaper to get. It’s not like he’s Bill Clinton or Obama. Plus, I would love to learn how to deal with failure.

RR: Who would you want to be your class’s Commencement speaker?
EL: Barack Obama. Yeah. The year that Harvard takes back the White House from the Yalies.
RR: Who else?
EL: Greenspan, Bernanke. I’m just really glad we didn’t get J.K. Rowling. Oh, and I wouldn’t mind having Bill Clinton and Hillary and Bill Gates–the power triple.
RR: What kind of speaker would make the most laughs?
EL: Sarah Palin.  And Tina Fey.
RR: Together?
EL: Yeah. I would so not fall asleep. All she would have to do is get up and say, “Can you see Russia from here?” Oh, and Russell Peters is really funny, though he’s kind of racist.  
SC: But the guy who played Borat [Sasha Cohen] already came to Harvard for Class Day. And Russell Peters would be a toned-down version of him.

RR: Who would you want to be your class’s Commencement speaker?
ZS: I know the very common answer you’re getting from everyone is Barack Obama.
RR: Right, but why Obama?
ZS: Since we had someone in the humanities/arts field last year–J.K. Rowling–it’d be good to have a governmental or political figure this time.  Plus, I voted for Obama on the senior poll that was asking us our recommendations for Commencement Day speaker.  
RR: Who else can you think of?
ZS: Anyone from Bollywood would be hilarious. Or Larry Summers, that would be funny. And what about Muntadhar al-Zaidi, the journalist with a penchant for hitting outgoing presidents with his shoe! He can talk about which brand is most aerodynamic! And one last thing—who’s that swimmer guy again? What’s his name?
RR: Michael Phelps?
ZS: Yeah, I’d love Phelps.
RR: Why? What would you learn from him?
ZS: How to make the most of every hundredth of a second of your college years.
RR: But by Commencement time, you seniors will be done with college.
RR: Okay, fine. Then our youth. Or rather, our pre-senior citizenship.

Jarret A. Zafran ’09
RR: Who would you want to be your class’s Commencement speaker?
JZ: Warren Buffett.  No, the economy’s in a tailspin. Barack Obama. No, Malcom Glenn [President of The Harvard Crimson]. I’ll say he’s the love of my life. I think that Glenn’s a lot wiser than Buffett and a lot more charismatic than Obama.
RR: Is Glenn paying you to say that?
JZ: No, of course not.
RR: Well, who else if Harvard wasn’t able to get Glenn?
JZ: Ann Coulter, because she would spew hot acid at the audience. And Sarah Palin would be really fun. And Benjamin Disraeli, even though he’s already dead.
RR: Anyone who would put you to sleep?
JZ: Stephanie Myers. No, Judy Bloom. She’d read a selection from Superfudge. No, actually I take that back.
RR: Then who would be bad?
JZ: Dick Cheney. That would be fun—in a scary creepy sort of way.
