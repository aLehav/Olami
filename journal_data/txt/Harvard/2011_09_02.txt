After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We appreciate it, FAS IT. We really do.
It really was sweet of you to switch Harvard  College email accounts to Google’s email client. However, upon further reflection, it seems to us that this shift will only result in more inconveniences for the daily life of the average Harvard student, an already overburdened and drastically underappreciated demographic.
Consider: everyone already has an established Gmail already, and, with a second account, there will now have to be an annoying and delicate dance between the two. Just think of the forwarding issues! Should one forward one’s school email from one Gmail account to another Gmail account? Or should one keep—and consistently check—two separate Gmail accounts at the same time? That just seems absurd. If one opts for forwarding between the two, what about the transferring of contacts from one account to another? How on earth is that supposed to work?
Most importantly, how in God’s good name are we supposed to handle the Gchat situation this switch presents the student body? Gchat, as everyone knows, is the choice means of communication for everyone with access to free wifi, which, let it be known, we consider a human right, right up there with high thread-count sheets and the air conditioning that still has yet to be installed in our sweltering, sweaty rooms (that’s another—and far more virulent—editorial we must write for the sake of this community). It is a mode of communication—nay, expression—that requires thought, creativity, inspiration, genius, and, above all else, emoticons. Needless to say, that kind of keyboard artistry and intellectual engagement requires a focus we have carefully cultivated and are rarely able to exert on anything else. In that sense, what are we to do with two Gchats? Type on two screens at once and compromise the literary merit and the iambic pentameter of our messages? Or sacrifice one of these two outlets for essential self-expression altogether? Also, while we’re on the subject, who thought students would enjoy seeing their teaching fellows’ chat statuses change to “available” at 2:30 a.m.? Or, for that matter, seeing what drivel their professors might list as Gchat statuses?
Then, of course, there is the security issue. Perhaps FAS IT thought it would be “cute” for students to message their economics professors accidentally with an invitation to the latest rager or to gossip about who asked whom to Eliot Fête? Frankly, this is far worse than any identity theft that can be fall one on the Internet, which should never—under any circumstances—be used as a tool to increase communication between students and faculty.
Although everyone says it’s the thought that counts, we feel compelled to point out that this change—as well as any change to the status quo or, for that matter, any maintenance of the status quo—will only further inconvenience our lot as Harvard students in 2011. It seems that this, along with so many others, is yet another cross we will have to bear.

Harvard has a drinking problem.
Maybe we’re partying too much: Rising  alcohol-related UHS admissions led to a series of administrative  crackdowns on unsanctioned boozy events ranging from Pfoho Golf to River  Run. Or maybe we’re not partying enough: Last semester, the UC put up a  cool 10 Gs in an attempt to fertilize the at-times barren social  landscape, and the debate over final clubs often boils down to one  between the social space haves and have-nots. So we find ourselves with a  conundrum: Given the status quo, any step taken to solve either the  problem of social space or the problem of alcohol consumption almost  necessarily exacerbates the other.
However, there is one way to separate dangerous and illicit drinking  from responsible drinking. The current drinking age legally and  therefore institutionally severs over half of the students from the  preferred methods of social interaction, ranging from the cocktail party  to the kegger. Such legal alienation drives students to drink dangerous  amounts in unfavorable situations. As a student who shares a name with  both an alumnus brewer and a favored local lager, I feel it is my duty  to play the role of Bacchus’s advocate.
135 college presidents, those of Dartmouth and Duke among them, realized  that current alcohol policy is doing more harm than good. Hence the  Amethyst Initiative, a 2008 petition that asserts we as a nation should  rethink the legal drinking age.
President Faust, it’s time to sign the Amethyst Initiative. Harvard’s  acknowledgment that the current drinking age could be the source of the  various problems associated with alcohol here and across the country  would instigate a broad national debate, which can do nothing but good.  The initiative calls the need for a sober and honest discussion on a  political topic that almost never gets discussed beyond stereotypes and  facile appeals to emotion. To clarify, Faust’s signature would not  commit Harvard to a stance in favor of a lower drinking age.
Harvard’s unique ability to generate headlines around the world any time  anything remotely interesting happens here is a tool that should not be  ignored. While the administration’s hands are legally tied when it  comes to its on-campus alcohol policy, they do have a reasonable amount  of power when it comes to shaping the national debate about those very  same laws. Faust’s signature would push the stagnating Amethyst  Initiative to the forefront.
Were the drinking age lowered to 18, safe drinking would replace binge  drinking in the large majority of situations. Dangerous binge drinking  does not occur in house-hosted Stein Clubs or happy hours. It occurs  behind locked doors in dorm rooms and private clubs.
Dangerous drinking occurs among underclassmen who take too many shots of  cheap vodka at a pregame because they don’t know whether they’ll  encounter any more booze at their next destination. Dangerous drinking  occurs not because there are too many opportunities for drinking, but  because there are too few.
It’s easy to forget that the drinking age of 21 is a new invention.  Until 1979 it was legal for an 18-year-old to drink in Massachusetts.  The elevation of the legal age came from the 1984 extortionary  congressional act that withheld highway funds from a state unless it  raised the drinking age. The constitutionality of such a mandate is  highly suspect and made it all the way to the Supreme Court.
The drinking age of 21 entices students to procure fake IDs. In a world  with a drinking age of 18, the false identification market would hardly  exist except for those who are looking to commit serious acts of  identity theft or worse. This would make it actually worth the police’s  time to investigate and prosecute within this smaller but malicious  market. Aside from the enforcement perspective, the explosion of demand  for fake IDs erodes respect for all laws among otherwise well-behaved  youth.
Finally, legalizing drinking would eliminate its rebellious appeal.  Sure, having a couple of drinks on the weekend is fun, but at the end of  the day getting drunk is nowhere near as compelling as the average  college student makes it out to be. Many kids binge drink because it’s  new and it’s rebellious. The current law creates a reverse psychology in  which drinking is more appealing because of its illegality, a lesson we  learned during Prohibition.
If the administration is serious about addressing its dual problems of  student over-drinking and under-enjoyment, then President Faust must  sign the Amethyst Initiative. I understand the adminstration’s current  perspective; they are compelled to abide by the letter of the the law.  But Harvard has the unique ability to call attention to the  counter-productivity of a law such as this one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a new man in town, a new frontrunner in the Republican  presidential primary.  And, I fear, it will be very difficult for  Harvard students to understand him.
Spend much time at all at Harvard and you’ll see that the students are  incredibly bright. In the student body, genius and creativity are as  common as house-list emails.  And it is obvious and accurate to say the  accomplishments will continue to pile up in the years to come.  Harvard  students are successful in so many areas that we often think that if we  just carefully analyze a problem, plan, and then execute our plan, we  will achieve success.  Our confidence is often well placed, however, in  the field of politics, we have reason to doubt such ability.
For generations, the ranks of federal government officials and aides  have been dominated by Harvard graduates, the “elite.”  And why not?   The best and the brightest are the most successful, so putting them into  power might appear to be a surefire way to bring prosperity and success  to America.  As the logic goes: Elect a president with an academically  stellar record, fill his cabinet positions with Nobel Prize winners, and  the policies and schemes they devise will surely bring the good days  back again.
A look at recent history shows a starkly opposite effect of the elite in  office.  Our past four presidents have been members of this elite—all  graduating from Ivy League universities. Similarly, throughout the  federal government, the upper crust of the educated still dominate.  And  yet, during a period of unprecedented opportunity for economic growth  through technology and globalization, America finds herself in the worst  economic situation since the Great Depression, fighting in multiple  wars and with an embarrassing credit rating.  In the past few years our  elite presidents and policymakers have had a pretty poor track record in  their endeavors.  They have been overconfident in our homeland  security, as well as in overseas nation building, in the longevity of  the budget surplus, in bubbling markets and overconfidence, and in the  success of stimulus spending.  Policies in these areas crafted by the  elite have failed, often miserably.
What the federal government needs is not the misplaced confidence that  comes from the elite, but rather some humility. The nation needs someone  to lead who is not overconfident in his ability to devise a clever  program but will lead us away from government-instituted Ponzi schemes  like Social Security. Someone who does not believe government can  regulate businesses into job creation but gets out of the way so as to  let businessmen succeed.  We need somebody who does not think nationwide  one-size-fits-all policies are the best way to legislate, need somebody  who does not believe government has all the answers.
Enter Governor Goodhair Rick Perry, the man who grew up in a place  without indoor plumbing or a zip code, who had modest grades at a modest  college, and the new Republican frontrunner for the presidential  nomination.  He is the consummate anti-elite.  While he has a number of  things working against him—his distrust of scientists, political  speeches that occasionally border on rude, and questionable foreign  policy credentials.  But, he is humble.  He admits government,  especially the federal government, does not have and never will have all  the answers to the problems America faces.  He wants policies to be  backed with clear constitutional authority that doesn’t take an elite  law degree and studying 200 years of court decisions to understand.  He  wants entitlement programs to be systematically sound.  He wants less  money in the hands of the government and more in the hands of the  people.  He wants the people’s decisions to be made by the people.  I  support Perry because he is humble enough to understand his government  cannot break the laws of common sense.
Right now this humility is concentrated in the anti-elite.  The less  bright, lessser educated politicians like Perry seem to understand what  the confidence of the elite blinds that group (us)  to.  Despite our  gifts, despite our intelligence and creativity, we fail to recognize  that our elaborate schemes inevitably break down when some innocent  assumption turns out to be false.  With our elaborate plans we create  not golden days but pain, instead of achieving dreams we destroy them.
I long for the day when the elite will be humble.  For now, I’ll vote for Perry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my home state of Texas, we are experiencing the worst dry spell in 60  years this summer–one that has cost Texas farmers and ranchers several  billion dollars. While the current drought is undoubtedly a bad one, it  doesn’t begin to compare to the drought in northeast Africa. The deaths  due to famine as well as the disruption of lives and livelihoods the  African drought has caused are staggering. Tens of thousands of people  in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Djibouti are estimated to have already lost  their lives. 3.2 million Somalis—half the total population—are suffering  from extreme hunger, and nearly 1,500 Somalis are arriving in Kenya’s  Dadaab refugee camp every day. While international donors and various  nations’ governments are providing emergency foreign aid to the most  severely affected regions, the drought is also having severe ripple  effects in areas not directly affected by the dry spell.
Last January, I traveled with three other Harvard students and a  University of Texas student to Wema Children’s Centre in western Kenya  to help the orphanage stay afloat. Already barely scraping by, the  orphanage directors worked two jobs to ensure that they could feed  Wema’s 150 mouths a day. Although the orphanage, located in the Bukembe  region of Kenya, is not directly affected by the lack of rainfall, it  was hit hard by the skyrocketing food prices resulting from the damage  to crops.
One of the directors, Teresa Wati, frequently emails me in desperation  as she has had to reduce the number of meals the children receive every  day. “Food prices have gone up nearly 60 percent” she writes. “We have  started rationing meals for the kids at Wema, and other kids in the  village have stopped going to school and started working to make extra  money so they can eat.” Life is in a tenuous balance at Wema, and some  of the children were already suffering from poor nutrition before these  latest difficulties. Now, teachers and cooks are demanding higher pay so  they can make ends meet as well. Additionally, more children have been  placed in the care of Wema, as villagers in the surrounding area have  too many mouths to feed as food prices rise, and so relieve some of  their burden by putting a child under the care of the orphanage.
Amanda Nguyen ’13 travelled to Wema for the first time this August to  continue the work we started in January, and was struck by the  incredible domino effect the drought has caused in the region. Though  international aid is pouring in (and rightfully so) to the people that  need it the most in northeastern Africa, places like Wema are silently  suffering. They, too, are in great danger if the drought continues and  their needs are overlooked for too long.
It is sometimes too easy to become inured to suffering taking place  halfway across the globe when the sheer magnitude of the tragedy is  blurred by inconceivably large numbers of dead or of people seeking help  in refugee camps. Nicholas D. Kristof ’81 of The New York Times wrote  an article in Outside Magazine about the “tragedy of the masses” that  describes this effect on people who read about human tragedy from afar.   Perhaps if I had never travelled to Kenya and met those who are  affected, I would read about the drought with great, but detached,  concern.
But when I remember seven-year-old Purity, with whom I played  duck-duck-goose every day, or four-year-old Zena, who was picked on  during play time every day for being the smallest, these troubles hit me  hard. When I read about the drought and famine, I see the faces of the  children at Wema and I wonder if they are frightened and going to bed  hungry or sick from malnutrition. For this reason, I urge those who have  the means to make a donation to an organization providing disaster  relief in Africa, or to make a donation to Wema Children’s Centre.

Overflowing with honey and bee-inspired products, the new Harvard Square store “Follow the Honey” not only sells merchandise but also hosts educational Skype sessions and honey-themed concerts.
Founded by longtime Cambridge resident and graduate of Emerson College Mary W. Canning, the store, located at 1132 Mass Ave., focuses on providing many varieties of honey—local, national, and international.
A “Honey on Tap” feature allows customers to purchase jars of honey, which they refill with whatever variety of honey is on tap.
But the store’s owners seek to do far more than just sell honey. According to Caneen Canning, Mary’s daughter and the store’s art designer, the store tries to create an environment honoring the “ancientness of it all—bees and their history that is far larger than us.”
Mary hopes to educate interested visitors about the process of beekeeping and its history by hosting weekly Skype conferences with beekeepers and authors. Mary said they  plan to expand the store by adding a multimedia center and a library devoted to bee related literature.
“Follow The Honey” is also hosting a show titled “Cirque de Miel” at Club Oberon on Sept. 5. The show will feature honey-inspired acts, including a performance by aerialist Seanna Sharpe, who was recently arrested after scaling and performing on the Williamsburg Bridge, and singer/songwriter and Cambridge native Natti Vogel.
“Honey has always been an inspiration for poets and writers,” Vogel said. “There’s something incredibly...fascinating, how slowly it moves—sashays.”
The store’s design is also inspired by the creation of honey, drawing on the image of a hive.
Caneen directed a team of local artists this summer to create the interior design, which includes laced tablecloths hand-dipped in beeswax, layered beeswax furniture, and an outside area where Mary envisions having community gatherings.
“It’s great for the city to be a hive for creative types,” Vogel said. “People do have honey in common, and Mary’s bringing an energy to it. She’s a great supporter of young artists.”
Mary found her passion for bees during her late husband’s fight with bone cancer, when she found solace visiting beekeepers in central Massachusetts. She later traveled to southern India and met with female beekeepers there.
“I was touched by how beautiful working with honey is,” Mary said. “There’s such a patriarchal tradition in the sciences, but I met all these women who invest themselves in it.”
Mary started beekeeping herself after her trip to India, and she began by selling honey at local farmers’ markets, including at Harvard and at the Charles River.
Mary said she sees bees and honey as something memorable and special to many people.
“Whatever degree they have a history or a memory with bees, there’s dynamic and engaged feelings about bees and honey,” Mary said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is ramping up preparations for its 375th anniversary that University leaders say will serve as a momentum builder for the upcoming capital campaign, a fundraising effort that is expected to raise several billion dollars.
Anniversary festivities will kick off on Oct. 14 with an evening of music, local food, and house spirit, according to University Marshal Jackie A. O’Neill. The celebrations will culminate with a gathering in an illuminated Tercentary Theatre. There, roaming performers will entertain guests while they sample Taza chocolate flowing from fountains, traditional New England apples, and an 18-by-15 foot cake—serving 4,000 people—that will be prepared by celebrity chef Joanne Chang ’91, who owns the local bakery chain Flour.
Renowned cellist Yo Yo Ma ’76 will perform along with the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and Holden Choirs.
Houses will also celebrate with parades and a historical dinner that will include dishes like hasty pudding.
In the weeks prior to the kick off, banners advertising the event and an audio installation featuring excerpts of notable speeches given at Harvard will be placed throughout the Yard.
Administrators selected a date in mid-October because historians believe that the University was founded during that month in 1636 and because many alumni and parents will be on campus for the fall Alumni Association meeting and Freshman Parents’ Weekend. Sixty-thousand local alumni were also invited to attend.
Twenty-five years ago, the University’s 350th anniversary was commemorated with a lavish formal dinner and an opening speech delivered by Prince Charles.
But Harvard Alumni Association Executive Director Jack P. Reardon Jr. ’60, who was present at the 350th anniversary, said that this celebration will be a more understated event.
“We’re a different institution today,” O’Neill said. “We are conscious of budget issues.”
O’Neill said that financial constraints have translated into an event that is student-driven and “homegrown.” The Marshal’s Office has been working closely with student groups such as House Committees and the Undergraduate Council to organize the event.
The University’s finances have been tight in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis, when Harvard’s endowment plunged by 30 percent.
The 375th will showcase Harvard’s progressive side and highlight its increased commitment to diversity, sustainability, and technology, according to O’Neill.
“Anniversaries are about marking a moment in time and looking back, but also about looking forward,” O’Neill said. “There has been remarkable change in the past 25 years.”
And as it prepares to celebrate its anniversary, the University has the upcoming capital campaign in mind.
Reardon said that the anniversary, like reunions, will serve to reconnect the University with alumni who they hope will contribute to the capital campaign.
“I think you get the most support for Harvard in every way when people think about the place,” Reardon said. “When people are back on campus, they think about [Harvard] more. The campaign will be coming along and certainly we want alumni to be thinking about what goes on here and the place’s needs.”
O’Neill said the anniversary will set the tone for the upcoming capital campaign and build momentum and excitement among alumni.
“It’s a party with a purpose—I’m not going to lie,” O’Neill said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: SEPT. 2, 2011
An earlier version of the headline for the Sept. 2 story "Harvard's 375th Anniversary To Kick Off with October Celebration" incorrectly stated that the 375th anniversary would serve as a kick-off for the upcoming capital campaign. While University adminstrators say the event will be build momentum for the campaign, it is not the formal beginning of the capital campaign.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Conservative columnist William J. Buckley Jr. famously said he would rather be governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston telephone book than by the faculty of Harvard University. And Buckley’s quote captures a larger anti-Harvard sentiment in American politics—a sentiment that has often haunted graduates as they seek public office, forcing them to address an often-exploited assumption that they answer to the Northeast liberal elite.
Now, Elizabeth Warren faces the same “Harvard problem.” Warren—who has been a member of Harvard Law School’s faculty for nearly two decades—is preparing to launch a campaign to unseat Republican Senator Scott P. Brown.
But even before her official announcement Republicans have questioned whether as a Harvard professor, Warren “best represents” the views and values of Massachusetts voters.
Although she has been upfront about her ties to Harvard, Warren’s message thus far—replete with stories from her small-town childhood in Oklahoma—seems designed to counteract any reputation she may have earned as an out-of-touch Harvard elitist.
THE HARVARD PROBLEM
When did Harvard become a bad word in professional politics?
The grudge against Harvard can be traced back to the Vietnam War, when Harvard famously banned the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, according to Massachusetts Democratic strategist Mary Ann Marsh. She says that even in the ’60s, Harvard seemed like a place where “people don’t spend time with the everyday people,” and “where people are far more interested in theory than interacting with people.”
Democratic strategist Scott Ferson echoed that Harvard is now often a negative buzz word in politics—synonymous with the idea of an out-of-touch class of Northeastern elites that is unpopular with most of the electorate.
Ferson added that the University is commonly associated with progressive ideals like greater equality for women and gay rights.
Fundamentally, Harvard invokes a class tension that Ferson says Brown would exploit in a general election by trying to convince voters that there is no way a Harvard professor could understand their problems.
Ferson added that the current political climate will make Warren’s status as Harvard faculty member an especially big hurdle for her campaign.
“At a time when ‘Tea Party, no experience, never put an economic equation together’ sells, I think it is going to be particularly difficult for her.”
‘A PHILOSOPHICAL CULT’
Warren’s Harvard problem is not unique or new. Numerous politicians have highlighted their opponent’s connection to the University with hope that the school’s reputation would make the candidate appear out-of-touch, extreme, and even effeminate.
Defending a more aggressive foreign policy strategy this week, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney used President Obama’s connection to Harvard to paint him as weak on defense.
“That may be what they think in that Harvard faculty lounge, but it’s not what they know on the battlefield!” Romney said. While he doesn’t mention it on the campaign trail, Romney holds business and law degrees from Harvard.
It is a stretch to say that the Harvard name has been a detractor for all candidates with ties to the University. There are currently 31 members of Congress with Harvard degrees.
But using Harvard as a code word for an allegedly dangerous brand of liberalism isn’t a new trick, either.
In his first presidential campaign against then-Governor Michael S. Dukakis ’60, President George H. W. Bush used Dukakis’ connection to Harvard to portray him as weak and extremist.
“Gov. Dukakis, his foreign policy views born in Harvard Yard’s boutique, would cut the muscle of our defense,” Bush said.
When asked why he mentioned Harvard specifically, Bush explained that he believed Harvard to be a “kind of a philosophical enclave,” and “a philosophical cult normally identified with extremely liberal causes.”
‘I CAME UP SCRAPPY’
Warren isn’t shy about her connection to Harvard.
“There’s nothing to handle,” Warren told The Boston Globe upon being asked about her association the University. “It is what it is. I’m also 5 foot 8.”
Though Warren may be content embracing her Harvard position, her message—which has begun to emerge during an ongoing listening tour through the state—seems to aim at putting Warren’s roots front and center. Her talks to activists and constituents take on a decidedly folksy flair, attempting to expunge any reputation for liberal elitism.
In other words, Warren hopes to show that Harvard isn’t her only identity.
“Yeah, I’m a Harvard professor,” Warren told The Globe. “But I wasn’t born at Harvard. I came up scrappy. I came up the hard way.”
Warren did not respond to an interview request for this article.
At gatherings of activists and voters in August, Warren shared stories from her childhood in a small town, growing up on what she calls the “ragged edge of the middle class in Oklahoma.”
“My brother David is the best storyteller God has put on this earth,” Warren said at one event. “There’s nothing I’d rather do than sit on the back porch and listen to him tell the story of the time they put the pig on the motorcycle and ran it down the main hall of Norman High.”
In addition to emphasizing her Oklahoma roots, Warren has says she would take her “scrappy” style to the floor of the U.S. Senate.
“It’s about being willing to take a good idea and fight for it,” Warren told The Globe. “It’s being willing to throw your body in front of a bus to block bad ideas.”

With an unusual drop in larcenies in Cambridge this summer, the Cambridge Police Department says that a new statistics program that compiles and analyzes crime data has helped the force carry out more informed policing.
The program, BridgeStat, was introduced in July 2010.
“We have been able to use it more effectively to predict where/when crime is going to occur and deploy our resources accordingly,” Cambrige Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello wrote in an email.
According to the BridgeStat cumulative reports, Cambridge saw 553 larcenies from May 24 to Aug. 1, a 6.7 percent decrease from last year’s 593 larcenies during the same period. According to Riviello, larceny rates generally increase over the summer when incidents of pickpocketing rise.
But burglaries during that period increased by more than 50 percent from 2010 to 2011, with 123 burglaries this summer and 81 last summer. Overall crime rates, however, saw little change between this year and last.
The statistics program provides a monthly cumulative report of street and violent crimes that allows Cambridge police to improve intelligence-led policing strategies based on data like historical trends and breakdowns of crime by type.
The information is also made available online to the public to build community awareness.
Riviello also said the Department has used BridgeStat data to pinpoint patterns of break-ins in several neighborhoods.
In Cambridgeport, for instance, Cambridge police successfully reduced break-ins by applying a heavier police presence while sharing prevention tips with residents.
This summer, a number of arrests in Cambridge made headlines.
On July 19, a former Harvard fellow Aaron Swartz was charged with hacking into the MIT network to steal 4 million JSTOR articles and other content with the intention of distributing them for free.
In mid-June, Cambridge police made five arrests in a three-day span following three separate robberies.
In one of the three cases, Cambridge police arrested three men who allegedly beat up and robbed a man at a bus stop.
The next day, police arrested a man in connection with an armed robbery. His accomplice was arrested the day after.
About a month later, Cambridge police arrested a suspect who allegedly raped a 19-year-old woman on July 4.
And in mid-July, three suspects were arraigned for “conspiring to induce travel to engage in prostitution” after a long-term FBI investigation exposed  four brothels in Cambridge and Allston.

Harvard values success above all else.
At least that’s how members of the Class of 2014 see it. In last spring’s freshman survey, respondents ranked “success” as the value that Harvard most stands for, choosing from a list of about a dozen options that included compassion and honesty.
The 90 percent of the class responding to the survey ranked hard work, honesty, respect, and compassion as their top four personal values.
Asked to do the same for Harvard, they ranked success first, followed by hard work, respect, and community.
According to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 students ranked compassion near the bottom of the list of Harvard’s attributes, despite naming it as one of the top values they personally held.
The results of the survey were discussed in a training session for Peer Advising Fellows—the Advising Programs Office’s entryway mentors for first-year students—in relation to the introduction of the “Class of 2015 Pledge.”
The pledge, which was signed by current freshmen before Tuesday’s convocation ceremony, asks students to help make Harvard an institution where “the exercise of kindness holds a place on par with intellectual attainment.”
According to Dingman, the decision to ask incoming students to sign a formalized statement of values occurred before the results of the survey came back.
However, PAFs present at the meeting said that the survey results were presented as a justification for issuing the pledge.
Dingman said that the survey’s results reiterated that the pledge was a step in the right direction.
“We felt that compassion contributes to the well-being of the community and students didn’t see this as a value that Harvard stood for,” Dingman said. “That’s unfortunate.”
The survey results also indicated that, while students place power and wealth at the bottom of their own values, they ranked them in the middle of the pack among the values of Harvard.
Dingman pointed out that although students did not think that Harvard embodied compassion, the fact that they ranked positive values like respect and community towards the top was “very heartening.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a discovery that could potentially revolutionize the way lenses are constructed, researchers at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have reformulated some of the most basic equations governing the behavior of light.
Cameras and telescopes commonly use compound lenses to “flatten” an incoming curved image. But with the team’s discovery, these bulky compound lenses could possibly be replaced by a single flat lens, which could be used to create very low footprint cameras and telescopes, according to Yu.
“If you need to build a system of lenses, you might be able to avoid some parts of the instruments with this technique,” said SEAS Visiting Fellow Zeno Gaburro, who is the co-principal investigator of the study along with Applied Physics Professor Federico Capasso.
The researchers developed generalized optics equations, a discovery which SEAS Research Associate Nanfang Yu, who is the lead author of the study, said was “very straightforward, very basic to the laws of physics.”
High school physics students studying optics have traditionally been taught that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection—that is, light hits a surface at a certain angle and then bounces back at that same angle.
According to Yu, this standard equation “is not general enough” because it only applies to two media separated by a simple surface, such as the boundary between water and air. The boundary itself is assumed to be “passive,” having no impact on the behavior of the passing light.
“We are generalizing the laws of reflection and refraction,” Yu said.
The researchers’ goal was to generalize the optics laws to apply to both passive boundaries and non-passive boundaries—interfaces that do interfere with the path of a light beam.
To do this, the team designed a boundary of tiny oscillating resonators that functioned as a non-passive medium between silicon and air.
When the researchers directed a beam of light at the engineered surface, the resonators imparted a time delay, or phase discontinuity, that bent the light at angles not predicted by the conventional optics laws.
To account for the discrepancy, the SEAS researchers added a new term to the standard laws of refraction and reflection to represent the phase shift imparted at the engineered interface.
Yu explained his team’s discovery using the classic “lifeguard problem” of physics, which poses the dilemma faced by a lifeguard upshore on the beach who must jump into the ocean to save a drowning swimmer.
Because he moves much faster on land than in water, the lifeguard—representing a beam of ligh—maximizes his traveling distance on land so that he can reach the swimmer as quickly as possible.
But with the SEAS team’s discovery, the problem changes. The lifeguard on the beach is now separated from the water by a jagged cliff—representing the non-passive interface—which he must now factor into his calculations, changing his optimal route.
According to Yu, the lifeguard problem illustrates the increased complexity of adding the new interface.
With or without the engineered surface, Yu said that light “always chooses the smallest traveling time from one point to another,” just like the lifeguard.
The team’s research paper was published Friday in the magazine Science.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Service Employees International Union Local 615 filed a grievance against the University this summer, claiming Harvard is not following the proper protocol for job selection among its custodial staff. The issue is now under arbitration.
According to Director of Higher Education for SEIU Local 615 Wayne M. Langley, the University’s contract with the union requires managers to post certain job openings so that current in-house workers can then apply for them.
If workers do not get the job, the University must send them a letter explaining why they were not selected for the position.
Langley said that the University is avoiding posting many jobs and instead moving people into new positions without taking into account factors such as seniority, as required by the contract.
“They’re not posting jobs so that people can apply, because then they have to tell people why they didn’t get [the jobs],” Langley said.
“If they say, ‘This is not really a posting,’ they can put whoever they want in. They’re playing funny games with wording.”
Langley added that the practice has a divisive effect on the workforce. “It raises questions of favoritism,” he said.
The University said that it does not believe it is violating its contract with SEIU.
“What’s at issue is an interpretation of contract language, and we’re confident that we can arrive at a satisfactory solution with the help of the arbitrator,” Harvard spokesperson Kevin Galvin said.
Langley said that long tenured workers believe the University is not fully recognizing their commitment to Harvard.
“Many of these workers have worked for over ten years here but don’t get better jobs. If someone’s been here for ten years, then they’re not bad at their job,” Langley said. “They want the University to respect their longevity.”
One worker, who asked to remain anonymous to maintain his relationship with his employer, said that he is worried he will never be able to move up the career ladder.
“They don’t tell me [that I did anything] wrong, but then I don’t get the good jobs,” he said.
He said that he has worked at Harvard for over five years without a promotion, while some of his colleagues who have worked for less than two have received better jobs.
Ultimately, Langley said workers are looking for recognition for their work.
“The crux of the issue is respect,” Langley said.
The arbitration on this issue comes at an already tense time as SEIU and the University are negotiating a new contract. The current contract expires September 23.
But Langley said the arbitration is not greatly affecting the negotiations.
“It’s one of many factors in the negotiation,” Langley said. “There’s a good chance we might settle outside arbitration”.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College is all about time management. With only 24 precious hours each day, we are constantly making choices about how to plan our schedules so that we can pass our classes and still make room for life’s important things: racking up kill streaks in Call of Duty, sinking jumpers at the MAC, and complaining about Ron and Sam’s dysfunctional relationship.
When all the day’s hours are finally divvied up, I’m going to take a wild guess and say that, for most students, not much time is left over for attending Harvard sporting events. (If this doesn’t apply to you then you should probably comp The Crimson’s sports board this semester).
For those of you who are only planning to make the trip across the river a few times this fall, we at The Back Page are here to help out. We’ve compiled a list of the top five Harvard sporting events to attend this fall so you can be a Crimson Crazy without spending too much time away from video games (or the library).
No. 5: Football vs. Penn. Nov. 12, 12 p.m.
“The Game” may get all the hype, but if the past two seasons are any indication, the Harvard-Penn matchup will be the one that decides who takes home the Ivy League title. This year appears to be no different, as the Quakers and Crimson enter the 2011 season predicted to finish first and second, respectively, in the Ancient Eight by the members of the media. This time around, Harvard will have home-field advantage, as the two-time defending champs will travel to Harvard Stadium in November.
No. 4: Men’s soccer vs. Northeastern. Sept. 4, 7 p.m.
Fans looking to get in a few games before classes start to heat up should take a trip to the Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium this Sunday for the men’s soccer team’s season opener. The lights will be on as the Crimson take the pitch against cross-town rival Northeastern.
No. 3: Women’s soccer vs. Penn. Sept. 23, 6 p.m.
Talk about jumping right into the thick of things. The Harvard women’s soccer team kicks off its conference schedule against the reigning Ivy champions. And with only seven Ancient Eight matchups, an early loss would be disastrous for a Crimson squad seeking its third title in the last four years.
No. 2: Head of the Charles. Oct. 22-23.
While it’s not exactly clear how one should actually watch a crew race (are you supposed to run with the boats along the banks of the river or just sit there and watch for a few seconds as they pass by?), the Head of the Charles is not to be missed. The world’s largest two-day regatta will be back in Cambridge once again this October. If rowing doesn’t excite you, never fear. There should be enough free ice cream and popcorn in the tents set up along the river to keep you happy.
No. 1: Football at Yale. Nov. 19, 12:00 p.m.
I don’t think this one needs much explanation, but being in the stands (or parking lot) for “The Game” is well worth the trip to New Haven. The stakes could be even higher than usual when the two squads meet for the season finale this year, as both squads boast championship-caliber rosters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sophomore Andrew Campbell made his third world championship final in two years after he finished second in today's lightweight single semifinals at the World Rowing Championships in Bled, Slovenia. In the process, he became the first lightweight to make the finals of the event since Steve Tucker achieved the same feat in 2002.
In the first semifinal of the event, Campbell finished five seconds behind Henrik Stephansen of Denmark and posted the fifth fastest time of the day.
The result followed an impressive heat win in which Campbell pushed past Italian sculler Pietro Ruta in the final sprint of the race to take the heat by .3 seconds. Ruta, who took second in the day's other semifinal, will have another shot at the Crimson sophomore in the final.
Earlier this summer, Campbell took bronze at the U23 World Championships. The 19-year-old took silver at last year's junior world championships.
Also in the running for a World Championship tomorrow is Esther Lofgren '07-'09. Lofgren, racing in the bow seat of the women's eight, is aiming for her second straight world championship in the event.
