Netflix recently released the “Big Mouth” Valentine’s Day Special, “My Furry Valentine,” the latest addition since the release of Season Two. Fans of the show will certainly rejoice at this move by Netflix, and for good reason. The special is a masterful blend of sharp writing, beautifully crafted awkwardness, and the dulcet tones of Nick Kroll. For those who crashed right through Seasons One and Two and have been starved for new content, it will surely delight with the return of a stellar cast of voices, some witty (but slightly disconcerting) Oedipus references, and — in keeping with the past two seasons — a couple musical numbers thrown in for good measure. “Big Mouth” never misses an opportunity to show what it’s good at: the good, the weird, and the downright grotesque.
The premise of this special is the ever so important, yet eternally terrifying prospect of Valentine’s Day for middle school students. The special, roughly twice as long as a typical episode at 46 minutes, delves into the various misfortunes, anxieties, and awkwardness of the holiday felt by the show’s characters. Nick (Nick Kroll), Andrew (John Mulaney), and their friends deal with crushes, rejection, loneliness, and the notorious hormone monsters, Maurice and Connie (Nick Kroll and Maya Rudolph). The climax of the episode unfolds with a superbly juvenile eruption of emotion and frustration brought on by a Valentine’s Day rejection. Kroll returns as impressive as ever, nailing memorable character voices like the insufferable Lola and the pathetic (yet iconic) Coach Steve.
“Big Mouth” uses worn out Valentine’s Day clichés to their advantage and flips them on their head. Kroll treats viewers to several musical numbers throughout the episode, inserting scathing lyrics lamenting the tropes and frustration of Valentine’s Day into cheesy love ballads. The plot also takes common comedic Valentine’s Day bits and gives them a new dimension. The frustration of “love triangles” manifests here in the ghost of composer Duke Ellington (Jordan Peele) when he exclaims to Nick that “Valentine's Day is a game of musical chairs, and there’s never one for old Duke.”
The special is a direct continuation of the second season, and that continuity is a logical choice. Rather than creating an isolated episode, the writers take advantage of the current messy plotlines from Season Two to develop characters in what appears to be a prelude to a much anticipated Season Three. The most impactful development is the shocking revelation to Nick that his new hormone monster at the end of the Season Two finale is actually Connie.
Though the Valentine’s Day special offers loyal viewers fresh middle school awkwardness, new viewers should stay away – very far away. The show itself is golden, and the special follows well in its usual style. Watching the special, however, without first watching the first two seasons may be too much for some. It’s better to ease in, as it will make the viewer much more prepared for the ramped up innuendo and nearly overwhelming sexual humor that pervades the show. There are jokes about incestual, conjoined twins and also a rather twisted bit on one student struggling to satisfy the Valentine’s Day wishes of his boyfriend and his girlfriend — both of whom are pillows (the jury’s still out on this one). The casual Netflix watcher is likely to be unnerved by the vulgar and often crude style of the show, even though it’s what makes “Big Mouth” so uniquely hilarious. The humor, characters, and especially the plot are much easier to grapple with after watching “Big Mouth” from the beginning. New viewer should then watch from the beginning, or the special might just leave you confused, queasy, and probably a little scared. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t watch “Big Mouth,” because once you start, the binge won’t stop.
The most effective — and most intriguing — aspect of the special is its singular ability to reach its audience. The premise is simple and relatable. Everyone had to go through that awkward and confusing trial of life called middle school. As Nick puts it, “It’s a rolling, growing pink snowball of stress that no one needs.” Whether you looked forward to the cards, candy, and roses or, like most, dreaded the mention of that day, the emotions and terrors of a teenage Valentine’s Day is a connection most share. “Big Mouth” taps into those raw feelings that have definitely been hidden away in the dark back room of the subconscious. The show is a spectacular tribute to the ugly side of Valentine’s Day, and celebrates the worst of this day in the best way possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Professor Emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz has joined Harvey Weinstein's legal defense team to consult on constitutional issues, according to a Feb. 15 court filing.
Dershowitz was granted permission to consult for Weinstein’s defense team on a pro hac vice basis, which allows lawyers to participate in a case outside of their legal jurisdiction so long as they can provide a certificate of good standing for the areas in which they are licensed to practice.
The suit Dershowitz is involved in is a class action lawsuit against Weinstein’s former production companies the Weinstein Company and Miramax; the Walt Disney Company; and Weinstein himself, among others. The lawsuit alleges that Weinstein violated federal sex trafficking laws. The former film producer faces separate criminal charges of sexual assault from two women in a Manhattan case that stem from accusations that he raped one woman and forcibly performed oral sex on another.
Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr., also a Harvard Law School professor, joined Weinstein’s legal team in the criminal case last month, drawing backlash from students and calls for him to step down from his faculty deanship.
The filings, first mentioned by New York Daily News reporter Stephen Brown on Twitter, indicate Dershowitz will be consulting on some email exchanges relevant to the case.
“I was retained by Defendant Harvey Weinstein’s counsel to consult with them regarding constitutional issues concerning certain e-mail correspondence,” Dershowitz’s court filings read.
Dershowitz said in an interview that the defense counsel retained him in an official capacity after plaintiffs in the case moved to block Weinstein from releasing certain email correspondence between him and his accusers.
“Weinstein has not hired me. I was retained by his original lawyer, Ben Brafman, to consult with Brafman on the constitutional issue around the case,” Dershowitz said. “It is an issue I have litigated in a number of contexts and one I feel very strongly about; and that is that he should be getting all the tapes, all the information, and then let the judge, the jury, the public decide.”
Dershowitz said he is working for Weinstein’s defense team because he believes in providing due process regardless of who is being accused of a crime.
“I am a criminal defense lawyer. My role is to help to anybody who is charged with a crime no matter how serious, no matter how heinous, no matter how unpopular,” Dershowitz said. “I have represented O. J. Simpson, Mike Milken, Anatoly Shcharansky, Bill Clinton. Of course I am going to accept a role in helping to provide due process and constitutional protections to anyone charged with a crime.”
Dershowitz also defended Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein in the Manhattan criminal proceedings. He said Sullivan was “doing the right thing” and that the students protesting “should be ashamed of themselves.”
“They should go back and read the Constitution, and be ashamed of themselves,” Dershowitz said. “The one thing I will never, ever be pressured by students.”
Following Sullivan’s decision to join Weinstein’s legal team, Sullivan sent an email to students addressing criticisms of his participation in the case. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said in an interview that the way Sullivan handled student concerns was “insufficient.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the weekend, Harvard was 4-2 in Ivy League play and in need of at least one win to be guaranteed to remain in the top four for the next week. The Crimson did one better, sweeping Princeton and Penn and improving to 6-2, putting it on the right side of the Ivy League tournament bubble by three full games and leaving it within one game of conference-leading Yale heading into next weekend’s matchup in New Haven.
Here are some takeaways from an impressive road sweep, which was spurred by the scorching-hot Bryce Aiken, who scored 58 points on the weekend:
Lewis, Harvard Show Resilience
In both Princeton and Philadelphia, it seemed at times as if the game was getting away from the Crimson. Harvard trailed by six deep into the second half of each game and seemed to have everything going against it.
Christian Juzang airballed two second half jumpers against Princeton — although he looked to have drawn contact on one of them — and spent the rest of the game showered with shouts of “airball” from the Tiger faithful. Chris Lewis fouled out against Princeton and missed seven of his first eight shots against Penn. The referees made several questionable calls against the Crimson in the Palestra, and Harvard did not take its first free throw for more than 33 minutes against the Quakers and had just three free throw attempts in regulation.
And despite all of that, the Crimson swept what is likely the Ivy League’s toughest road trip. Lewis’s gutsy performance against Penn served as a good microcosm of Harvard’s weekend performance. Given the tough task of guarding Quaker big man AJ Brodeur, he struggled mightily early on both offensively and defensively. The Alpharetta, Ga., native was scoreless in the first half with two turnovers, and he picked up his second foul just 10 seconds into the second half.
But Lewis came up big when the Crimson needed him most. Down seven — Harvard’s biggest deficit of the game — with six minutes left, he scored out of the post and then got a steal and layup to bring the Crimson within three. He was just as important on the defensive end, getting that crucial steal and blocking three shots in the second half and overtime. While Brodeur had the edge in regulation, it was the resilient Lewis who outscored the Quaker star 4-0 in overtime and blocked his opponent’s only shot in the extra period.
Noah Kirkwood Breaks Out
While Bryce Aiken will get most of the plaudits (and rightfully so), it is also important not to underestimate the impact that freshman Noah Kirkwood had on both nights. In Princeton, he fought through the frustration of not getting some calls he thought he deserved from the officials to score 16 points on 10 shots. He then came back the next night with a well-earned 14 points in a career high 32 minutes. 
It was Kirkwood’s first ever full Ivy League road weekend, but it certainly did not look like it. The Ontario native was a team-best +17 on the court against Penn, and the 62% free throw shooter drained two clutch free throws with 49 seconds left in overtime to give Harvard a seven point edge.
The freshman still has to work on cutting down his turnovers — he turns the ball over a team-high three times per contest — but his shooting ability and knack for creating looks for himself off the dribble should allow him to continue to see ample playing time as coach Tommy Amaker looks for secondary scoring around Aiken.
Ball Movement Still an Issue 
Despite winning both games this weekend, Harvard continued to have a hard time creating easy looks from crisp passing. A night after registering just seven assists in Princeton, the Crimson’s assist total shrunk further still to a paltry four in the Palestra.
As Penn coach Steve Donahue said after the game, it is rare that a team wins a game with a 4:19 assist:turnover ratio, and while Harvard managed to do just that, the lack of assists must still be a concern for Amaker going forward.
 The Crimson’s 12.3 assists per game ranks 265th in the nation, which would be concerning enough, but Harvard’s 9.1 assists per league game would be lowest in the country if prorated over the entire season. Some of this is the natural result of being led by a score-first guard like Aiken, but the Crimson has been unable recently to capitalize on size advantages inside and to get Lewis, its second leading scorer on the season, going.
When Aiken inevitably cools off, Harvard is going to have to find other ways to get buckets, and that should start with better ball movement.
Shortening the Rotation
Earlier in the season, it was not unusual to see Amaker rotate the lineup liberally throughout the game, with as many as 12 players seeing significant playing time. As one might have expected, that has no longer been the case in recent Ivy League play.
The same nine players played in both games this weekend, and in the Princeton game Amaker rolled almost entirely with the same seven players, as eight and ninth men Danilo Djuricic and Rio Haskett played just five and four minutes apiece.
It is clear that the five starters, Henry Welsh, and Noah Kirkwood will continue to get meaningful playing time going forward, but it will be interesting to see what Amaker does with Djuricic and Haskett. 
Djuricic provides size, energy, and defensive mobility (he drew a big charge in the Penn game) as a stretch four contributor, but has remained relatively quiet from three-point land of late, one of his main fortes.
Haskett has also struggled this season from the floor, shooting just 28% on the season and scoring just seven points in Ivy League play.
The Richmond native can still get hot in a hurry, as he showed against Northeastern early in the season — and he also provides a lot to the team with his defense and energy — but he is playing less as a sophomore than he did as a freshman and must step up offensively if he wants to remain a major part of Amaker’s calculus going forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 With its first game in the books for the 2019 season, the Harvard Men’s Lacrosse Team has reasons to be proud of its fight. Strong play from newcomers against a tough Tar Heels team forecasts well for the campaign to come despite the loss.
A UNC (2-0) team ranked No. 12/14 this year defeated the Crimson (0-1) squad 16-11, powering through a well-rounded team effort from the Harvard group. The Tar Heels capitalized off of a hot start against the visiting Crimson with a pair of UNC freshman attackmen, Henry Schertzinger and Jacob Kelly, who netted three of the first four goals of the game. For Harvard, its own freshman stepped up to the challenge. Attackman Austin Madronic scored his first two goals of his Crimson career in the opening period, brining the game to 3-2.
UNC dominated most of the second quarter, scoring four of the five goals. However, in the last four minutes of play, junior attackman Ryan Graff added a pair of big goals to bring the game to a more manageable 2 goal deficit. After a strong Freshman season in which Graff ranked third on the team with points (22) and second on the team in goals (20), Graff’s sophomore season was racked with injuries. Fired up and ready to make his mark on the league fully healthy this year, Graff netted a career high five goals in Saturday's contest, overcoming his previous high of four.
The third period saw Madronic bag his third goal of the game and junior tri-captain Kyle Anderson score his first, extending his point-scoring streak to 14 games, which tracks back to last year. Anderson was a dominant force on attack last season, netting a team high 34 goals to go along with 8 assists. He hopes to build on last year’s success throughout the 2019 season. With crunch time approaching, the score stood at a manageable 8-11 with the Harvard team ready to make a final push for the win.
The fourth quarter saw a hungry Crimson team surging, as Graff added another two goals within the first 8 minutes to bring the UNC lead to only one goal. However, three straight UNC goals put the game out of reach. On a more positive note, two freshman combined to score a final Harvard goal with 2:38 left in the game. First-time starter Isaiah Dawson nabbed his first career goal, assisted by Madronic, Harvard’s points leader for the game.
“UNC was a good team and it was a very physical game,” Anderson commented on the team’s performance, “I was proud of our guys for standing tall and fighting back. With eight minutes left we were down 11-10 and it was anyone’s game.”
The tale of the tape revealed a good fight against a talented UNC squad. Three freshman — Madronic, Dawson, and Nick Loring — started their first games for the Crimson and two of them scored.
“Overall the college game is definitely faster than high school lacrosse,” Loring commented on the comparisons between the college and high school game, “but the coaches and upperclassmen have been really helpful in getting the freshman up to speed with schemes and gameplay.”
A quality performance from fellow first-time starter sophomore Kyle Mullin in goal kept Harvard in the game with a game-high 14 saves. The discipline and responsibility that Harvard coach Chris Wojick ‘96 emphasized over the offseason paid off, as the Crimson squad stayed competitive in the game all the way to the end.
“Unfortunately a couple of balls bounced their way in the end and we didn’t get the outcome we wanted,” Anderson said. “But I think everyone is excited about the start and [is] looking forward to building on it next Saturday at home against Umass.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 The Crimson men’s squash team ended its undefeated season with a dominant 9-0 win over Trinity in the National Championship to claim its 26th Potter Cup on Sunday. After losing to Trinity the past two years in the championship game, Harvard was finally able to avenge its previous defeats.
The Crimson’s strenuous weekend ultimately proved successful. It defeated Dartmouth 7-2 on Friday, Penn 8-1 on Saturday, and Trinity 9-0 on Sunday.
The team dominated the entire season, with its closest match being a 6-3 regular season victory over Penn. Sophomore Samuel Scherl and junior Timothy Brownell both attributed their dominance to a focus on “the little things.”
“We just worked hard this season and have been putting in the hours since September and we trained all over winter break so it was just about the little things,” commented Scherl. “There was a lot of talent, but talent doesn’t really go anywhere if you are not willing to put in the hard work. This season we had the combination of talent and hard work.”
Brownell came to a very similar conclusion.
“It’s all about the little things; they make such a huge difference in squash,” Brownell said. “We really took care of our bodies: eating well, sleeping well, hydrating. Everyone was really good at focusing on all of the little, kind of boring things that are easy to slack off on. I think that’s why in the end we were so good in the finals.”
Brownell has been on the team the past three seasons, and thus experienced the past two heartbreaking losses to Trinity in the Championship Finals. This team’s ability to obtain the title was especially satisfying for him.
“We’ve been here before, so it was really cool to be in my position, playing in the National Finals the last two years and coming up short,” Brownell explained. “So to be here again, feeling really confident in our abilities, it was just amazing and beyond cool to win today.”
The long journey began with the first match in mid-November. To maintain the dominance throughout the entire season takes determination and perseverance.
“I think a lot of it comes down to discipline,” Brownell said. “In the fall, it is harder to put in the work when the finals are so far away. This year we put in all the work and it really paid off later on.”
For Scherl, the weekend was about proving the team is deserving of the top spot.
“The regular season can be inconsequential because it really all comes down to Nationals where we got to show that we deserve the top spot,” Scherl said. “It was about unfinished business and avenging the losses from earlier and acknowledging the Harvard victory in the Harvard-Trinity rivalry.”
Though the team is used to high-intensity situations, the proximity to Trinity fans made the Championship venue at Yale all the more pressure-filled. Even though the Crimson was familiar with the finals pressure, the pregame routine was just as important as any regular season match.
“I need to separate and do some sprints away from the crowd and put the match out of my mind before I go on,” Scherl explained. “I get in the zone and just try to separate from the pressures because it can be very intense.”
The team thoroughly goes through all of its opponents’ strengths and weaknesses to solidify each court’s gameplan. For the final match against Trinity, a focus on complete dominance was key.
“We really wanted to come out with a 9-0 decisive win,” said Scherl. “Every match is a National Final match; there are no expendable matches… I think that speaks to the focus of the program.”
Marwan Tarek secured the win for Harvard in a five-game match against Thoboki Mohohlo, 9-11, 11-6, 9-11, 11-4, 11-4. The team stormed the court - respectfully, after Mohohlo exited - to celebrate the win. However, the Crimson remembered its original gameplan and recognized its job was not complete, even though the overall win was certain.
“Even once we had the win there was no let up of intensity; everyone was working just as hard because this is what we’ve trained for,” said Scherl, who was in the middle of his match when his team stormed Tarek’s court. “When it was already 8-0, our final player, George Crowne, beat his opponent in a game in which his opponent didn’t score any points, which is incredibly hard at this level of squash. I think that demonstrates what the goal of today was: to not only win, but win with a statement and vengeance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A weekend of classic Harvard Hockey and tremendous play by freshman goalie Lindsay Reed earned Harvard a come-from-behind win against St. Lawrence and a last-second overtime loss to Clarkson, the current back-to-back defending national champions. The 4-2 victory over St. Lawrence (13-13-6, 8-7-5 ECAC) on Friday and a 3-2 overtime loss to No. 4/4 Clarkson (24-7-1, 15-5-0) on Saturday solidified Harvard’s (11-13-3, 9-9-2) ECAC playoff standings as it looks to a final weekend of regular season hockey.
HARVARD 2, CLARKSON 3 (OT)
For the second time in its last three contests, Harvard was headed to overtime against a top-10 team. With three periods of play insufficient to determine a victor, the Crimson would need either a quick goal or an impenetrable defense to earn points in the single five-minute period of sudden death and move up the ECAC standings just in time for playoffs.
Reed, who had already seen 48 shots and stopped 46 to improve her nation-leading 0.945 save percentage, and the rest of the Harvard defense held steady, allowing a single Clarkson shot in the first four minutes of extra time.
The Crimson, meanwhile had displayed some offensive promise, with Jovanovich and Petrie getting shots at the Golden Knights. Then, with half a minute remaining, a Clarkson breakaway brought the puck end-to-end. Senior forward Loren Gabel got off the shot, but Reed corralled it.
As the clock wound down, though, a tie was looking probable — and impressive, given the opponent’s position as defending back-to-back national champion.
Suddenly, with less than ten seconds remaining, the puck found sophomore forward Elizabeth Giguere. Reed positioned to block a possible shot as Giguere glided down the right side — but Giguere passed back to an incoming Gabel.
Catching Reed out of position beyond the crease as she reached in an attempt to block Giguere’s dish, Gabel saw an open-net shot. The nation’s best goal-scorer found her mark, notching a second score against the nation’s best goalkeeper to earn the Knights a pair of points and hand Harvard its first ECAC loss of the month. A red “4.9” stared down on the Crimson from the clock.
The Crimson’s path to overtime in the Saturday afternoon contest against the two-time defending national champions had been all but certain. An early shot put Harvard’s initial offensive struggles against St. Lawrence in the past, and three minutes in a hooking minor was called on senior forward Kelly Mariani.
Just over twenty seconds later, senior defender Kaitlin Tse, in her last game at Bright-Landry, whacked a laser from the point. A deflection by freshman defender Maryna Macdonald, a tap from freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere, and the puck skimmed by former Ohio State All-American Kassidy Sauve to put the Crimson in the lead and extend Della Rovere’s goal streak to five games.
“We’re really focusing on lower shots, and since [the last game against Clarkson], we’ve really been focused in every game on getting to the net and screening the goalie,” junior forward Kat Hughes. “Traffic in front and getting those gritty goals is how we’re going to be successful.”
Twenty-two seconds later, the Knights responded — as teams studded with championship-winning veterans are wont to do. After retaking the puck from faceoff-winning Harvard, Giguere cruised down the ice. Reed positioned for the block, but a backward pass from the goal line found an open junior forward Michaela Pejzlova, who beat a stretching Reed for the equalizer.
From there, Clarkson dominated through the both intermission, outshooting the Crimson by 30-14 following the initial goal by the Knights. A post shot minutes into the second nearly gave Clarkson, but — as usual — luck favored Harvard.
Four minutes later, Giguere catalyzed another Clarkson play. Senior defender Emma Keenan picked up her rebounding shot, centering to a crashing Gabel. A slight adjustment to the puck’s trajectory, and a sprawling Reed watched it hit the twine.
Clutch Crimson play held the Knights’ lead to one, enduring a penalty-heavy period of 4-on-5s, 4-on-4s, and 3-on-4s, but Clarkson’s domination continued after the second break and through the opening half of the third.
Harvard continued to hold off the Knights, and Reed’s leg pad barely deflected a second puck to the post with less than 10 minutes remaining.
Twenty seconds after a near lead-expander by Clarkson, the puck found its way to the Knights’ ice. A pass from co-captain and forward Lexie Laing, and Tse fired from the point for a second time. On this zinger, though, there was no follow-through needed — the puck went five-hole, tying the game.
“We’ve caught ourselves in some situations where we’re coming from behind,” Della Rovere said. “We’re always so positive and we always work super hard and make sure that everything we get we earn, so even though these teams are ahead of us in the standings, as long as we’re working hard and doing the little things, we’ll be successful.”
In a classic display of Harvard Hockey — a save-heavy, offense-efficient strategy that has earned many an improbable win against top opponents — the Crimson was once again running with the big dogs. After surviving a power play in the final few minutes, and despite Clarkson outshooting the Crimson by more than two-to-one, the game advanced to overtime.
Following the conclusion of their final game at Bright-Landry Hockey Center, the team’s four graduating seniors - defender Kaitlin Tse, forward Bradley Fusco, and co-captains Lexie Laing and Kate Hallett - and their families were honored on the ice.
HARVARD 4, ST. LAWRENCE 2
 Despite falling to a 2-0 deficit in the second period and getting outshot 47-30 on the game, Harvard rallied in the final two periods to score the next four goals. The Crimson put up two goals in the second period in under two minutes before icing the game with two more quick goals in the final half of the third. The road to the 4-2 victory, however, at times seemed like an improbable one.
“I think it’s easy to get down on yourselves after a period like that [the first period], so we really focused on staying positive in the locker room and not getting too nit-picky about our play,” Hughes said. “A smart hustle is something we really focused on. Sticking to the basics really helped us transition to a better period and rest of the game.”
A pivotal moment in the game came when, on a power play with a 2-0 lead in the second, St. Lawrence drew a second Harvard penalty. Sophomore defender Kate Glover had just gone to the box for cross-checking, and after just 1:02, Tse joined her for a checking minor.
With the two-skater advantage, the Saints created a flurry of chances, most notably rattling a deflection off the crossbar. On the rebound, St. Lawrence would pounce for a follow-up, but Reed dove back to the post to keep the puck out of the net. In the game, the Saints would hit the post or crossbar a handful of times. The opposition was on the verge of a 3-0 lead, but the Crimson managed to kill off the rest of the two penalties.
“Penalty kills in general are always a big momentum shifter for us as a team,” Hughes said. “I think we really utilized that [energy] from the bench watching the kids out there killing those penalties. It was able to motivate us and get our feet going [to] put pucks in the net.”
The successful penalty kill did indeed prove to be a major momentum shift. Within two minutes of the defensive stand, Harvard added two goals of its own. What could have been a 3-0 deficit turned into a 2-2 tie game.
“Going into that second period, even getting down a goal, we kept the energy positive,” Della Rovere said. “No one got down on ourselves, so it caused us to build off that.”
After some defense-to-defense passing from Macdonald to freshman defender Kyra Willoughby, Willoughby found sophomore forward Becca Gilmore for a rush.
Matched by the St. Lawrence defense, Gilmore continued streaking forward before cutting towards goal at the last second. Completing the sharp cut, she pulled the puck to her backhand before sliding it past the outstretched leg of Saints senior goalie Grace Harrison for the first Harvard tally of the game.
Just 32 seconds later, sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich would earn possession to set up sophomore defender Emma Buckles for a one-time blast. Making pure contact, Buckles powered the puck cleanly through traffic and past Harrison to knot the game at two.
In the latter part of the first period, St. Lawrence junior defender Jacquie Diffley sprinted down the ice in a rush similar to Gilmore’s. Unlike Gilmore, however, she elected to shoot earlier rather than cut, and the decision proved to be the right one. Angling the puck to the far top-corner, Diffley was able to squeak a shot past Reed, who did get a piece of it—but not enough to keep it out of the net. At the start of the middle frame, the Saints wasted no time, scoring just 26 seconds into the period. Sophomore defender Skylar Podvey launched a point shot, and senior forward Rachael Smith positioned herself squarely in front of the net to provide a screen and deflection to put St. Lawrence up 2-0.
After the combined three-goal second period, neither squad would find the back of the net for 13-plus minutes in the third. Then, with 6:53 to go in the contest, Harvard broke the tie. Initiating offense from the defensive end, Laing created a turnover and funneled the puck to Willoughby, who contributed the secondary assist. Receiving the puck and carrying it further, Della Rovere weaved a backhand pass through multiple Saint defenders.
“[The rush] definitely started with the back-check,” said Della Rovere. “Lexie Laing made a huge back-check … picked off the puck, and followed up with a great pass, so I was able to get open and receive a pass that allowed me to use my speed … Also, Kat [Hughes] getting a second effort to get her stick on the ice and finding a way to get a stick on that puck was huge.”
As the puck slid into prime scoring position, Hughes was able to locate it despite the St. Lawrence defender’s efforts. Fighting through a stick lift from the Saints defense, Hughes managed to get her stick on the puck, chipping it over Harrison’s pad for the 3-2 lead.
“Kristin Della Rovere [and I] were kind of on a two-on-two, and she’s got great speed on an outside drive,” said Hughes. “It ended up being a two-on-one. It was a great pass—she just slid it behind the [defense], and I was able to get a stick on it. It went in, but it was a really great team effort and line play there.”
Nonetheless, after scoring the go-ahead goal, the Crimson put itself in a precarious position. Just over a minute after the strike, sophomore forward Keely Moy headed to the sin bin for a checking minor. Despite the penalty, Harvard proved unfazed and once again capitalized on a special teams opportunity.
Blocking a shot at the point, Della Rovere pushed the puck up ahead into the neutral zone. Initially, a St. Lawrence defender beat her to the puck, yet Della Rovere was able to poke the puck forward and then out-race the Saint on the second-effort. Now alone on a breakaway, Della Rovere finished the highlight-reel play with an unassisted, short-handed, game-icing goal that gave Harvard a 4-2 lead.
“After that blocked shot, just the energy from the bench — I don’t know — kind of hearing my teammates just screaming and everything was just a huge energy shift,” said Della Rovere. “Moving forward, I guess I found a way.”
Reed, who made the diving save to prevent the 2-0 deficit from becoming 3-0, proved solid as ever in net. Over the last 39:34 of the game, she held St. Lawrence scoreless en route to a 45-save performance. Reed has now made 45-plus saves in four of her last five starts.
Harvard has wrapped up Bright-Landry hockey for the regular season and will head to Brown on Friday before taking on Yale Saturday in attempts to improve its ECAC playoff seeding. The Crimson currently sits at seventh in the conference.
