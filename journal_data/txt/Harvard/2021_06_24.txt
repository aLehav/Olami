After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday, May 15 marked 73 years since al-Nakba, or the “catastrophe.” At least 750,000 Palestinians were forced out of their homes on the eve of Israel’s creation in 1948. Fifteen thousand Palestinians lost their lives, and upwards of 500 villages were ravaged to make way for the new state.
This year, Nakba day was again observed with atrocities to mourn for Palestinians. On Tuesday, May 4, assaults began on peaceful Palestinian protesters rallying against the impending eviction of Palestinian families living in Sheikh Jarrah. Days later, Israeli forces wounded over 300 worshipers at the Al-Aqsa mosque, where thousands of individuals were gathered for prayer during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. State-sanctioned aggression and right-wing vigilante violence towards Palestinians began all throughout Palestine and Israel, along with the most intense airstrikes Gaza has witnessed since 2014. At least 256 Palestinians, including 67 children, have been killed.
These killings are not isolated incidents. Israel’s apartheid regime has imposed a hegemonic, authoritarian rule over Palestinians. Not only does the state control Palestinian lives militarily and economically, but it has subjected them to a plethora of discriminatory laws that leave Palestinian lives at the mercy of systemic violence and dispossession. Israel has placed restrictions on Palestinians’ access to water, electricity, their freedom of movement, and continued its incursions onto indigenous Palestinian lands that were protected and declared free of potential Israeli encroachment by mutual treaties and agreements. The recent wave of airstrikes alone has left nearly 2,500 people homeless in Gaza, according to Palestinian officials.
As violence raged on in Gaza, Israel, and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Palestinian groups at Harvard came together to condemn the actions of the Israeli government and Harvard’s complicity in that violence by publishing a statement that now has the co-sponsorship of over 900 individuals and 92 student groups.
The statement called on Harvard to remove its nearly $200 million in investments in companies complicit in Israel’s acts of violence and illegal settlements and demanded the University publicly rebuke Israel’s use of excessive force.
The statement was signed by student organizations such as Act on a Dream, the Phillips Brooks House Association, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, the Racial Justice Coalition, the Jewish Coalition for Peace at Harvard College, and Harvard Graduate Students Union, along with faculty, affiliates, alumni, and current students.
This statement marks a promising start towards changing the narrative on Palestine and the Israeli apartheid regime — however, our work has not yet ended. While millions have expressed support for Palestinian efforts to organize on campus and beyond, we must ensure that this support is long-lasting and takes the shape of genuine allyship that centers on Palestinian voices. Even as the broader Harvard community commits itself to notions of equality, justice, and fundamental human rights irrespective of identity, our peers often make an exception for Palestinian suffering.
Universities, mainstream media outlets, and politicians are equally complicit in this double standard — often attempting to dehumanize Palestinians and regard pro-Palestinian voices as those on the fringes of political discourse and extreme in nature. It is incredibly disheartening to see people who passionately oppose regressive laws on immigration, mass incarceration, racial justice, gender equality, and BGLTQ rights dismiss Palestinian liberation as a cause not worth the same amount of discourse or attention.
Being “apolitical” or claiming that one “does not know enough about the issue” is, in fact, a political stance — especially in the face of widespread violence.
Further, the recurrent oppression is normalized in the media and often explained using anti-Arab racism and Islamophobic tropes — meaning it is imperative that future decision-makers challenge the narrative fed to them about Palestine. As students attending one of the most influential universities globally, one that stands for “Veritas” and fostering “citizen-leaders,” it is unjust of us to turn a blind eye towards incessant violence that has targeted innocents across generations.
While American voters consider ourselves far-removed from the conflict, no entity supports Israeli apartheid policies as much as the United States.
In 1995, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act despite the controversial nature of moving the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and in defiance of Palestinian interests. Diplomatically, the U.S. continues to prevent any attempt to hold Israel accountable, guaranteeing its impunity at various international organizations, including at the United Nations Security Council. Israel continues to be the largest recipient of U.S. foreign and military aid: In 2016, the United States passed the largest military aid package it has ever given to a country, providing $38 billion in military assistance to Israel over the next decade. In early May, the Biden Administration promised $735 million in weapons sales to the Israeli government by the Biden Administration. According to the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, Massachusetts taxpayers alone gives over $128 million each year in military aid to Israel.
Even though a ceasefire has been negotiated after 11 days of atrocities, bombardments near citizens have continued, and there is no guarantee that Israel’s growing settlements, blockades, and apartheid laws will be terminated. We must organize behind the cause of Palestinian liberation until equal rights are guaranteed for all citizens in Israel and Palestine. It is worth all of us considering how the funding channeled to Israel is being used. It is equally vital to assess to what extent America’s support for Israel’s “right to defend itself” is encroaching on Palestinians’ right to exist.
The Nakba never ended. It continues with every Israeli airstrike on Palestinian homes, every new settlement made on indigenous Palestinian lands, and every time Israel attempts to silence pro-Palestine voices across the globe. It will continue as long as every upcoming generation of Palestinians is denied its fundamental rights. It will continue until we hold ourselves and our representatives accountable for perpetuating war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Palestine can not afford our willful ignorance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are pleased, but not surprised, to see how much traction our Harvard Israel Initiative letter has gained: Over 1000 signatures from Harvard faculty, parents, alumni, and students across all Harvard schools, with over 100 of those from Harvard professors. Our inboxes were flooded with messages from Harvard affiliates who wanted to know how they could best spread our message in support of Israel and in solidarity against antisemitism.
We would like to thank all those who signed our letter.
We are grateful to President Bacow for his own letter denouncing the surge in antisemitic attacks across the country. We are encouraged by the abundance of people who came to speak at Cambridge City Council against a Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions-inspired resolution, which was ultimately defeated. We appreciate President Joe Biden reiterating Israel’s right to defend itself and promising to replenish Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, which performed the miraculous feat of intercepting 90 percent of Hamas’s missiles launched from Gaza, saving countless civilian lives. And finally, we are grateful that an overwhelming majority of Americans continue to stand with Israel.
A poll from the Hill and HarrisX of 932 registered voters found that roughly 80 percent of Democrats supported President Biden’s response to the recent fighting between Gaza and Israel, and a different Gallup poll found that 85 percent of Republicans view Israel favorably. These voters are likely aware that Israel’s airstrikes on Gaza were a defensive response to being bombarded by more than 4,000 missiles from Gaza-based Hamas, a designated terrorist organization with an obvious mission of genocide against Jews, as advanced in their original 1988 covenant and by Hamas leadership, one of whom just last month urged their followers “to cut off the heads of the Jews with knives.”
Why is it that the people of the United States, the President, Congress, every country in Europe, Oceania, much of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and a growing number of Muslim-majority Arab Gulf States continue to support Israel’s right to exist? Why do so many of them explicitly assert Israel’s right to defend itself? Why are these countries eager to work with Israel to explore economic opportunities and joint technological projects despite the BDS movement’s efforts to demonize and delegitimize Israel by associating it with terms like “apartheid”?
Presumably, most of them see what is obvious to us — that charges calling Israel an “apartheid state” are false. “Apartheid,” the Afrikaans word for “apart-hood,” is defined as “a former policy of segregation and political, social, and economic discrimination against the nonwhite majority in the Republic of South Africa.” Those who misappropriate the term ignore that Israel is an inclusive democracy that affords equal political rights to all of its citizens — Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Druze, and others.
The Israeli Parliament is composed of all of these groups and has shown its legal commitment to equality through legislation that outlaws discrimination based on race, religion, sex, nationality, and sexual orientation. Arab citizens are integral members of Israeli society, serving as judges, police officers, physicians, scientists, and Knesset members since the state’s founding. They, like all Israeli citizens, are entitled to health care in a national health system and are provided public education in Hebrew or Arabic. Israel also does not practice apartheid in the West Bank, where Palestinians have their own government, or in Gaza, from which Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005.
We also suspect that most Americans recognize that the charge of colonialism is patently false. Jews have been living continuously in what is now Israel for millennia. Rather than colonialists serving some foreign power, many of the Jewish communities that returned to Israel in the past 100 years have come as immigrants and refugees from European and Arab countries. These people are as indigenous to the Israeli landscape as Masada and the Mediterranean Sea.
We maintain that Israel, like all countries, has numerous problems. And, like other democracies, it addresses those problems through its legal system, its commitment to open discussion, and with a populace that has always been willing to seek peace and change for the better. We understand that some well-intentioned BDS supporters are frustrated with the conditions in Gaza and what they see as a lack of progress in implementing a two-state solution. However, BDS is no remedy to these problems.
The founders of the BDS movement have clearly stated their opposition to self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians. Instead, founder Omar Barghouti expressed that “we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine.” BDS supporters like As’ad AbuKhalil have also stated that their goal is to “bring down the state of Israel.” One can only imagine how much bloodshed that would entail, but we are not surprised that these extremes are being considered, given that Barghouti has said, “we’re not ashamed to have armed resistance as well as peaceful resistance” when talking generally about Palestinians’ actions.
We are concerned that false labels such as apartheid serve to rile up the most dangerous sentiments against Jews in America. Indeed, American Jews have long been disproportionately targeted in hate crimes, with antisemitic attacks rising by 115 percent last month from the same time last year — in step with radical anti-Israel activity and demonizing anti-Israel narratives. It has not escaped us that many antisemitic verbal and physical attacks attempt to disguise themselves as anti-Israel activism. When three men drove through Borough Park in Brooklyn, harassing Jews, kicking a synagogue’s doors down, and yelling antisemitic slurs, their cries of “Free Palestine” did not excuse or negate their antisemitism. Similarly, the assault against Jewish diners in Los Angeles by protestors carrying Palestinian flags was an act of ethnically-targeted violence. It goes without saying that attacking Jews is not activism: It is antisemitism. We urge our peers to practice extreme caution with inflammatory language that could inspire violence that you might not anticipate.
If Harvard students and faculty wish to improve the standing of the Arab citizens of Israel and advocate for Palestinian self-determination, they should follow in the lead of Dr. Mansour Abbas, the leader of the Ra’am party in Israel’s new government coalition: Identify the problems that exist, formulate solutions, and work with the government and people of Israel to assure a day when all people – Israeli, Palestinian, and otherwise – can live in peace and dignity.
