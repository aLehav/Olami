After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In case you missed Harvard’s recent cheating scandal, former Crimson columnist extraordinaire Alexandra A. Petri ’10 summed it up best when she wrote, “After all, the only thing more embarrassing than taking a course where your entire grade is dependent on open-book, open-note, open-Internet, take-home exams is taking a course like that and not getting an A. So you collaborate.” Culturally, we Harvardians fear failure, Petri says. And, I’d like to add, we particularly fear failing alone.
Harvard’s educational philosophy is—explicitly and otherwise—communal, even cooperative. We spend our time here in Houses and dining halls, with our blocking groups and advising tutors, networking away. On the one hand, our connections to others are probably the best thing we can take away from our time in college. Certainly J.K. Rowling agreed when she told Harvard seniors that what she wished them most of all at graduation was what she had herself: “The friends with whom I sat on graduation day have been my friends for life… at our graduation we were bound by enormous affection, by our shared experience of a time that could never come again, and, of course, by the knowledge that we held certain photographic evidence that would be exceptionally valuable if any of us ran for Prime Minister.” No matter how we pad our curricula vitae (or, better yet, shape our minds), our experience here is deeply defined by the community we live with: both its many flaws and its great beauty. (I hope. Otherwise, I may politely suggest that you might be Doing It Wrong.)
But like so many things of value, the key is in purposeful balance. I don’t actually mean to criticize “Harvard culture” here because culture is precisely about what we share, not the private choices of individuals. I also am not arguing that people should live individualistic lives or that they should be afraid to rely on each other. These mistakes may be even worse than relying on others too much, and life is complex and ironic enough that people are susceptible to both relying on others too little and too much at the same time.
But I have been pondering this complicated spectrum between communal and individual life from my freshman loneliness to my senior year restlessness, and the latter has made me realize that I’ve spent a lot of time absorbing the ethic of listening to and even leveraging my relationships with others and much less time contemplating how to make my own decisions. Some days, I can hardly choose a class or a paper topic or a time to eat dinner without asking the person next to me what they think. It’s not even about prolonged doubt of my own abilities as much as it is a knee-jerk reflex, the same kind of impulse as “isn’t there an app for that?”
It’s particularly ironic, in a way, because if I had taken some of my Harvard classes to heart just a little more, I would likely be better at self-direction. Philosophy and literature, two of my favorite subjects, are largely about how to live one’s own life well, and academic argumentation at its best is not just about convincing others, but also about thinking for oneself. I’d understood that intellectually all along, but only now—looming closer to departing to serve better my country and my kind—have I begun to really connect it to my everyday life.
Next year, and hopefully all the years of my life, I will have my blockmates, my friends, and the alumni network. The first two are wonderful and the last useful. But all the best guidance in the world is meaningless without one’s own self-direction. The big challenge is combining the two. Furthermore, precious as friendship and good advice are, they tend to be easier to find than internal-self assurance.
Lately, I think of a particularly stubborn Harvard graduate who rejected even the wisdom of his elders, scoffing: “They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me anything to the purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it does not avail me that they have tried it.” Life is, despite the best resources, an unpredictable life-long adventure with no external answer key. When I read his book in high school, I thought Henry David Thoreau, class of 1837, awfully strange for choosing to live alone in the woods for two years. But I can see now why he wanted to after graduating from Harvard—he was looking for the other half of his education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than any other ally relationship, the United States’ unwavering bond with Israel poses a persistent foreign policy challenge. Be it in tempering talk of an Israeli military strike on Iran or the persistent challenge of assuring the Muslim world that America is working in good faith toward peace, the United States deals with the consequences of its special relationship on a regular basis.
Standing by our nation since the fight against communism during the Cold War, Israel continues to be one of America’s most valued and trusted allies. In fact, the structure of American foreign policy in the Middle East is so centered upon U.S.-Israeli relations that it has inevitably created tension in the Arab world. Every anti-American conflagration in the Middle East—such as the recent spat of violent anti-American protests—reminds us of the consequences of our special relationship with Israel. It is clear that America must do more to decentralize its focus on Israel in order to build closer ties with the broader Middle East.
Last year, President Obama staunchly sided with Israel against Palestine’s request for full state membership, suggesting that peace would not be achievable through any decision made at the United Nations. Since granting UN statehood would give the access to the International Criminal Court necessary to allow Palestine to carry out war crime prosecutions, this response appears more to be an effort to preserve the integrity of U.S.-Israeli relations than an attempt to promote peace talks. As if that isn’t enough to frame the U.S. as an Israeli-centric nation, events from this month alone would erase any doubt. Namely, both Romney’s recently leaked remarks about Palestine’s alleged lack of interest in peace, coupled with the perceived role of the American-made film “Innocence of Muslims” in paving the way for the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, do little to construct a positive image for U.S. relations with the Middle East. Whether or not such claims hold even a minuscule degree of merit, one thing we can be certain of is that the attacks demonstrate a real anti-American sentiment which should be taken as a challenge for the U.S. to amend its foreign policy.
The United States is fervent in keeping Israel on its side for a few reasons, the most important being defense. Israel is a favorable ally in part because it is a democracy that America can rely on for security cooperation. Israel is lauded and revered for creating some of the most advanced missiles and drones along with possessing one of the best espionage agencies in the world. Alternatively, others argue that the U.S. has a sense of moral responsibility to continue nourishing Israel, a mindset that was formed primarily in response to adversity Jews have faced since time imemorial. While it is only valid to agree that Israel plays an integral role in U.S. homeland security efforts, we must not be too quick to discuss moral duties when Palestinians, despite attempts at peace such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, continue to have their lands settled by right-wing extremists. There is no question that military defense is a key topic in foreign relations and is crucial to the prosperity of our nation—but so are human rights. If promoting human rights truly is a “central goal of U.S. foreign policy,” America must demonstrate this through encouraging peace and compromise instead of taking a passive approach in the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Israel is fated to time and again find itself at odds with the Muslim world. Naturally, America’s decision to back Israel consistently has sometimes been at the root of anti-American sentiment. The U.S. does not need to completely distance itself from Israel. Rather, it must strike a balance between its support of the nation and the Middle East as a whole in order to implement fully a more holistic foreign policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many months, Harvard University and the largest union on campus have been engaged in as-of-yet unresolved negotiations over a new employment contract.
The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents more than 4,600 non-faculty Harvard workers, has called for wage increases above a standard rise to match inflation. It is unfortunate that these negotiations have taken so long, which have left union members working without a contract for over two months. Clearly, the latter are eager to settle a new contract soon, as evidenced by the more than 1,000 HUCTW members and their supporters who demonstrated last Thursday. Harvard and HUCTW should cut a deal as soon as possible, ending economic uncertainty and potential negative ramifications for all parties involved.
Naturally, bargaining and compromise constitute an important part of any contract negotiation, and both Harvard and its employees should be willing to make concessions in order to settle the contract in a reasonable time. However, Harvard should take advantage of its comparatively sound financial standing and be willing to hand meaningful wage raises to its workers.
Harvard has a history of good labor policies, and this latest contract ought to be no exception. A factsheet released by HUCTW notes that from 2002 to 2009, “union members’ pay grew at about 1.5 percentage points more than price inflation each year on average,” totaling a wage increase of between 4.3 and 5.3 percent per year. In 2010 and 2011, the union agreed to accept a lower pay raise in order to help the university through difficult financial times as it struggled to recover from the hit taken to its endowment in the economic crisis.
Last week, Harvard released a statement arguing that the administration had already offered good terms to HUCTW, pointing out that Harvard already offers its employees a very strong compensation package. The statement also argued that the University is still facing financial uncertainty, citing the fact that Harvard’s endowment recently saw a 0.05 percent drop in its overall investments.
While Harvard is correct to be cautious on major spending increases at a time of enduring economic insecurity, it must also take into account the broader implications of a weak economy. An uncertain macroeconomic outlook and continuingly high unemployment rates have created a very tough labor market in the U.S. While small employers can be hit hard by thinning profit margins and are simply unable to pay their staff more or avoid layoffs in times of recession, this is plainly not true for Harvard, which boats the world’s largest university endowment to tide it through in uncertain times.
Harvard should consider its own fortunate position amid a sea of unemployment and falling profits, as well as the financial condition of its workers and their families, and grant at least modest wage rises to its workers above a 2 percent rate of inflation. ­­­
Harvard’s endowment currently sits at $30.7 billion, a figure that is near pre-recession highs. Last year, as workers settled for limited wage increases, the endowment grew nearly 20 percent. As a non-profit, Harvard University possesses the advantage of not having to prioritize turning huge profits every year. The University’s current financial situation suggests that it should have no problem granting at least modest wage raises to the employees who are so essential to its academic mission. Indeed, Harvard could take its lead from other universities in the area: the contract tentatively settled yesterday that governs wages and benefits for 14,000 custodians around New England—including workers at other universities in Boston and Cambridge—just granted janitors a wage increase that averages over 4 percent per year.
Harvard’s primary duty is to serve as an effective educational establishment. Yet, Harvard also has a history of considering its role in society more broadly. Our University must considering how it can act in a way that is socially responsible, looking out for members of its community, whether residents of Allston or Harvard workers. This can include striving to offer its employees better pay and benefits than its peers do.
HUCTW members are hardworking and knowledgeable employees who assist the wider Harvard community in valuable ways everyday. As students, we depend on the work of library workers, House administrators, department staff, and other HUCTW members every day. Students should be vocal in their support of these workers in their contract negotiations.
As in any negotiation, both sides will have to cut a deal in some form. There is more to a union contract than wage raises, and Harvard and HUCTW will also have to bargain about healthcare costs, which members are counted as part of the bargaining unit, and other topics. We hope that Harvard is willing to bend a little and offer decent wage rises to HUCTW—and hope that the contract is settled soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly four years after the start of the financial crisis, unemployment remains high and business investment is slowing. The housing sector appears to finally be sputtering back to life, but America is still waiting for a sustained recovery.
So what are our leaders doing about it? Largely nothing.
In a country with all the economic tools to give a serious pick-me-up to its slow economy, most of the key players are sitting on their hands or actively making things worse. Congress has blocked the President’s jobs plan and is actually cutting spending before the economy has recovered.
And so America, finding its democratic institutions incapable of responding to economic sluggishness, turns to its resident technocrats at the Federal Reserve. On September 13, the Fed announced a new round of monetary stimulus in which it would buy billions of dollars in long-term assets and mortgage-backed securities to drive down long-term interest rates, including mortgages.
Past rounds of stimulus have had specific end-points, limiting their impact. In a significant shift, the Fed said this time its commitment to asset purchases would be open-ended. The Fed will continue the stimulus not just until the labor market improves “substantially,” but “for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.” In effect, the Fed is making clear that it isn’t joking around this time.
Which is nice to hear, because looking at Capitol Hill, you get the impression that our leaders think they’re playing a game in which reelection is the only goal and actually helping the economy is something nice to do if you can get around to it.
Current fiscal policy is wildly inappropriate, combining short-term tightening during a weak economy with inaction on our serious long-term federal shortfall. Congress hasn’t passed a significant stimulus bill since 2009. In fact, Congress itself has managed to create one of the gravest threats to the recovery with the fiscal cliff, which we continue to blithely sail towards. Meanwhile, leaders in both parties position themselves for political advantage in the inevitable national crisis at the end of this year instead of working to defuse the time bomb.
Republicans serve an important role as long-term budget hawks, but in their rightward lurch they’ve forgotten tried and true ways to stimulate in the short term. Cutting spending during a sluggish recovery will hurt your economy, as Britain can attest. Long-term debt matters, but it’s okay to temporarily expand borrowing to stimulate yourself out of a recession (including with tax cuts!) when your borrowing rates are effectively negative and inflation is low.
President Obama essentially got as much fiscal stimulus through Congress as he could. His economic team felt the stimulus needed to be roughly twice as large to truly fill the “output gap” in the economy, but the moderate Senate Democrats whose votes were needed to overcome a GOP filibuster demanded it be no larger than $800 billion.
The bill likely should have included more aggressive action to restart the housing market, but there is no doubt that the stimulus helped the economy, Mitt Romney’s claims notwithstanding. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it increased employment in the second quarter of 2010 by 1.4 to 3.3 million. Private economic forecasters and a consensus of academic studies arrive at similar conclusions.
Yet last fall, when Obama proposed the American Jobs Act—basically, a second helping of stimulus that would create 250,000 to 2 million jobs, depending on whom you ask—Senate Republicans filibustered it.
Clearly, the two parties have very different philosophies on how to spur economic growth. Democrats favor spending while Republicans favor tax cuts and deregulation. Luckily, those two policies are not incompatible; we could pass another large stimulus package tomorrow split evenly between new spending and tax cuts. Unfortunately, polarization has reached the point where one party refuses such compromises as a rule.
The result: Millions of Americans who could be employed search fruitlessly for work, losing skills and slipping into the ranks of the long-term unemployed. This, because politicians have lost the willingness to compromise that has kept our diverse nation together since the beginning.
And that leaves the Fed, insulated as it is from the perverse political pressures of today’s Washington, to take action. Monetary stimulus, however, is not a panacea and is reaching its limits, as Ben Bernanke has warned. Congress needs to, but won’t, do its part with smart fiscal policy, meaning both short-term stimulus and long-term deficit reduction.
I’m as much a fan of democracy as the next American, but our political system today is of the parties, by the parties, and for the parties. Somewhere along the way, the public good got lost in the shuffle. Maybe that will change someday, but until then the Fed will remain a lonely curiosity of Washington: A proactive institution that bases its policy on sound evidence rather than partisan ideology and is beholden to no one but the American people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent weeks, expanded construction to the Science Center Plaza has narrowed pedestrian access from the Yard to a winding walkway lined with cement barriers and colorful banners. Students say that these renovations have made it difficult to navigate transitions between classes.
Emiliano W. Valle ’16 said he suffers the effects of the Science Center Plaza construction zone’s takeover of walking space on his daily walks between Annenberg and the Yard.
“Dust often flies in my eyes and I have to cover my nose with my shirt to block out the smell,” he said.
Construction is underway to update the Cambridge Street tunnel roof and to renovate the Plaza into a more usable and sustainable common space that will include benches, tables, and new lighting.
Although several gates connect the Yard to the Plaza, construction has recently caused some gates to close for periods of time and narrowed the pedestrian walkway considerably.
Hundreds of students struggle through the narrow walkway on the way to and from class everyday, sometimes funneling through only one open gate to the Yard.
“It’s annoying not knowing which gates are open because when I’m in a rush to class, [the limited gate access] creates a lot of foot traffic,” said Valle.
Tony, a construction worker at the site who declined to give his last name, said that the gates are opening and closing because of “logistics,” but declined to provide more details.
Over the next few months, as construction progresses, public access to the plaza will increase and regular programming will return.
Students have said that further difficulties are posed by the fact that cyclists and pedestrians must share the walkway between the Science Center and the gates.
“I blame the bikers for the congestion,” said Samantha D. Martin ’16.
Others said that the cyclists are dangerous to the pedestrians in the walkway.
“I saw a woman nearly get run over by someone on a bike,” Herman K. Bhupal ’16 said.
The renovation to the Plaza will include new bike paths to enhance safety.
In the next few months public access to the plaza will increase and regular programming will steadily return as construction progresses.

In an effort to bring together information about yoga and meditation opportunities at Harvard, Kelly S. Robinson ’13, who teaches yoga classes on campus, recently launched the blog Veritas Yoga.
The blog, veritasyoga.wordpress.com, features a compilation of all the schedules for the various yoga classes offered on campus—at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Hemenway Gym, and in the Houses—that were previously publicized only on separate lists.
“A friend asked me when I teach yoga, and I only teach at random hours and there’s a ton of other yoga classes being taught,” Robinson said. “It’s really easy for me to compile them onto one page to give to everyone in the community.”
Robinson said yoga can serve as a form of relaxation for Harvard students.
“Harvard is a stressful place and it’s nice to chill out for a while,” she said.
In the past few years, the number of classes offered per week at Harvard has increased from approximately two to ten or twelve, according to Dawn M. Stenis, Harvard Recreation’s area fitness program manager. In the gyms, yoga classes, especially those in the evening, fill up quickly. Students must arrive 15 minutes before class to claim a spot in the class, said Stenis.
Robinson’s blog also features information about the Harvard College Meditation Club, led by Bo-Mi Choi, a former lecturer in social studies at Harvard who is currently affiliated with the Cambridge Zen Center.
Choi said she agrees that yoga can be a form of relaxation. However, she said that if students begin the practice of yoga and meditation with the sole goal of stress reduction in mind, they will miss or overlook another significant benefit.
“There’s a spiritual component. You can secularize it, but [yoga]...is a way you can figure out what’s really important in life,” said Choi. “Harvard can be a little biosphere where everyone has the same sort of view on things, and [we try] to give a different perspective on how to lead a fulfilling life, something that is outside the frame of what undergraduates usually get to hear.”
Choi leads a one-hour Zen meditation session on Wednesdays in Adams House that consists of breathing exercises, chanting, and 20 minutes of meditation followed by a question and answer session.
Last year, the club consisted of five freshmen. This year, it has grown substantially, and more than 15 people have attended the first few meditation workshops.
“I think almost every Harvard student would benefit from meditating or doing yoga once a week,” said Jen A. Guidera ’15, the co-president of the Meditation Club and a yoga practitioner. “There’s just so much going on here all the time and to be able to step back and take a break is a really valuable thing.”

A campus-wide student center will feature prominently in the University’s upcoming capital campaign, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview with The Crimson Tuesday.
“That is a priority,” Faust said of the new campus center, which she described as “a vibrant community campus-wide common space that also can serve important needs for student space.”
Faust said she envisions the space as a gathering place for graduate students, undergraduates, and faculty members. She named the Holyoke Center as a likely candidate for its location.
“We’ve been looking at Holyoke pretty strongly,” she said. “I think it could be a really exciting core for the campus, and it’s located in a place that would bring people together very effectively.”
Faust said that although no plans have been finalized, the campus center will like include “large open spaces that could be used for parties, lectures, events,” as well as smaller areas that could serve as meeting space for students organizations. According to Faust, the University will convene a committee of Harvard students and faculty to draft finalized plans for the space.
Last year, the Undergraduate Council released a report outlining the need for a student center on Harvard’s campus and asking that the University consider that need when drafting priorities for the upcoming capital campaign. The Crimson has previously reported that Harvard expects to raise more than $6 billion in a University-wide fundraising campaign set to launch publicly late next year.
“I’m really thrilled by President Faust’s comments. This is something that students have been pushing for years,” said UC Representative Jen Q. Zhu ’14. “The fact that she’s having these conversations really gives me hope.”
Zhu, who co-authored the UC report, is also an inactive photography Crimson editor.
According to Faust the University will look for a donor to support the project as part of its the upcoming capital campaign. Once a donor is identified, the project should move quickly, she said.
Undergraduates have long called for the creation of a student center, which many see as a solution to a dearth of social space on Harvard’s campus.
The UC report called for a space dedicated exclusively to undergraduates, but Faust made clear that a “campus center” will cater to the broader Harvard community.
In 2008 the University created the Committee on Common Spaces—a group tasked with identifying areas that might be better utilized by the University.
The group pinpointed the Yard, the plaza outside the Science Center, and the Holyoke Center as locations that could be turned into social space for the College. As a result of their recommendations, Harvard purchased the brightly colored chairs that have become a fixture in the Yard during warmer months.
Faust has often referenced the work of the Common Spaces Committee when confronted with student concerns over a lack of social space, but in the past she has avoided acknowledging that the University plans to create a student center in the near future.
“This common spaces initiative is one of the things that I’ve felt [is] most critical to Harvard’s development as an integrated University in which people can really reach out to one another across schools and students and faculty,” Faust said Tuesday.

A Harvard Law School student has been indicted on two counts of indecent assault and battery on a 24-year-old woman and will be arraigned in Middlesex Superior Court Wednesday.
Brandon J. Winston is charged with inappropriately touching the vaginal area and breast of the victim on Jan. 15, 2011, according to the indictment handed down by a grand jury in September.
When reached by phone on Tuesday, Winston declined to speak about the indictment.
He instead referred a request for comment to his attorney, Daniel K. Gelb, who wrote in an emailed statement, “Mr. Winston denies any wrongdoing and we do not wish to comment further at this time.”
Winston is scheduled to be arraigned in Woburn, Mass., on Wednesday morning. There, he will be read the charges against him and will enter a plea of guilty or not guilty to them.
Stephanie Guyotte, a spokesperson for the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, confirmed that the two counts concerned a single victim. She also provided the age and gender of the victim.
Guyotte declined to comment on whether the victim was affiliated with Harvard.
The Harvard Web Directory lists Winston as a current student in the JD program at the Law School.
His listed email address indicates that he enrolled as a member of the Law School’s Class of 2012, but his current listing in the Harvard alumni directory indicates that he is set to graduate with the Class of 2013.
The charges against Winston could affect his standing at the Law School.
The Law School’s Handbook of Academic Policies states that a student may be placed on an involuntary leave of absence if he or she “has been arrested on allegations of serious criminal behavior or has been charged with such behavior by law enforcement authorities.”

Last semester, Harvard students marched the streets of Boston protesting the MBTA’s proposed fare hike. But since the increases went into effect July 1, many Harvard students and employees say that the hikes have not had a significant effect on their lives.
After months of debate, the MBTA and Massachusetts Department of Transportation enacted a 23 percent overall fare hike, which increases subway fare with a CharlieCard from $1.70 to $2, to help close a $185 million budget deficit. The MBTA also increased fares on the commuter rail and cut some services.
Jackson F. Cashion ’13, a longtime advocate against MBTA fare increases, said, “The 23 percent fare increase affects us just as much as it does everyone else.”
Saying that the MBTA can exercise several options for alleviating its debt, Cashion suggested that Harvard could chip in financial support.
“Harvard gets a huge benefit from having the T station right here,” said Cashion, an inactive Crimson editor. “I think there’s a lot of great ideas out there about trying to get public institutions that really get a significant benefit from the T to try to pitch in more.”
Cambridge City Councillor E. Denise Simmons told The Crimson on Monday that she is concerned about the fare increases. “Of course this has a real impact on residents of Cambridge,” she said. “In particular, the fare increases are going to affect our seniors and are going to affect our students.”
Despite the increase, Harvard has maintained its transit subsidies for employees. Through the the University’s Commuter Choice Program, Harvard provides 50 percent subsidies on monthly CharlieCard passes for eligible faculty and staff. The rest of the cost is taken directly out of the staff members’ paychecks on a pre-tax basis.
Jaime Ayala, a dining hall worker in Lowell House, commutes for 30 minutes on the 96 bus to and from his home in Medford each day. He said he appreciates the discount from the University and the accessibility of the T for his commute. The increases in fares, he said, have not affected him significantly.
“Price changes haven’t been that big of a deal,” Ayala said. “[The University discount] is a great benefit. Otherwise it would be so much harder to get to work and find parking.”
Students at Harvard graduate schools, but not at the College, are eligible for discounted semester-long T passes. Several Boston colleges and universities participate in the semester-pass program as well, including Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern University. The schools subsidize the passes at various levels, MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo said.
At MIT, not only can students receive subsidized monthly passes, but their student IDs double as CharlieCards.
Many students at the College said that although almost every Harvard College student lives on campus rather than commuting to school, the College should still subsidize MBTA passes to encourage them to travel more in the greater Boston area.
“I think that even though we’re so close to Boston, a lot of Harvard students don’t get to appreciate that,” Cashion said.
Cashion suggested that a subsidized CharlieCard tied to the Harvard College ID, similar to MIT’s, would not only urge students to explore but also contribute financially to the struggling MBTA.
“It would be a great way for the University to help contribute to the public transportation that we enjoy here in Cambridge,” Cashion said.
Harvard is currently considering the possibility of a subsidy for College students, said Colin B. Durrant, communications manager of Harvard’s Office for Sustainability.
Some students benefit from discounted T passes from students groups or employers.
Phillips Brooks House Association covers T fare for many of the charitable programs under its umbrella, and organizations affiliated with the Harvard Public Service Network can apply for a transportation grant, which provides CharlieCards with a $5 stored value.
“It encourages students to get out of campus and experience the city,” Public Service Network program manager Varsha Ghosh wrote in an email. “The cost of getting to a program should not be a barrier to service.”
However, the application process is competitive and has a deadline at the beginning of each semester, Ghosh wrote.
The cost for Jennifer K. Cloutier ’13, who takes the Red Line to Massachusetts General Hospital to work on her thesis, is covered by her department at the hospital.
Cloutier said subsidized T passes would be great to help bring students out of the “Harvard bubble,” but she acknowledged that the cost may be prohibitive.
Students wishing to run their own student outing can apply for a grant from the Undergraduate Council for CharlieCard reimbursements.
“We fund transportation for the greater Boston area,” said UC treasurer Jonathan Y. Li ’14. “Anywhere the T goes, we’ll cover.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concluding a year-long search for the newest addition to Harvard Greek life, the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council announced Monday that the Alpha Phi sorority will begin recruitment next spring.
Alpha Phi will join Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta as Harvard’s fourth sorority. Harvard is also home to three male fraternities—Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Chi.
Last April, The Crimson first reported that the three present sororities were in the process of choosing a new sorority to join their ranks after more than 10 percent of Harvard’s female freshmen, sophomores, and juniors chose to rush sororities for the past two years.
In 2011, a record-high 268 women rushed, the largest rush class in the College’s history. This spring, the number dipped slightly to 250.
Alpha Phi International Fraternity Executive Director Linda Kahangi said that the organization submitted a written proposal last year to join the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council. Last fall, Kahangi said, the sorority was invited to campus to participate in the final round along with two other sororities.
Kahangi said that the organization is thrilled to join the Harvard women’s social scene.
“We have wanted to be there since the Greek system expanded at Harvard,” Kahangi said.
Since there are no current Alpha Phi members on campus, the recruitment and rush process this spring for the new sorority will be different than the one for the other three sororities. Kahangi said that this fall Alpha Phi will use focus groups to connect to undergraduate women and get to know the campus.
In January, it will move two full-time consultants to campus and conduct a marketing campaign for several weeks to reach out to the student body and interested groups. Alpha Phi will also hold a series of events designed to introduce interested women to Alpha Phi and to one another, according to Kahangi.
“What we are really trying to do is get women who blend well together,” she said. “We will be watching the group gel together and creating a really good group that is the core of the new chapter.”
Alpha Phi will also seek out upperclassmen to act as leaders of the new Alpha Phi chapter. The new sorority will work with the established sororities on campus to market the organization and tailor it to match the interests of Harvard women, Kahangi said.
In April, then-Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson told The Crimson that the new chapter, like existing single-sex social organizations, will not be recognized by the University. Representatives from the Office of Student Life could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.
The presidents of all three current sororities—Sarah L. A. Erwin ’13 of Kappa Kappa Gamma, Molly A. Wehlage ’13 of Kappa Alpha Theta, and Carolina I. Ragolta ’13 of Delta Gamma—could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. President of the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council, Taylor A. Compton ’13, did not respond to requests for comment.
Alpha Phi already has five chapters in the Boston area and a 1,700-person alumni base within a 30-mile radius of Harvard, according to Kahangi.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis “Bud” Riley acknowledged that students have been swapping rumors about a “draconian crackdown” on partying, he said Tuesday night that no student has been arrested this year for an alcohol violation and that HUPD has no plans to change its policy on enforcing laws against underage drinking.
At a panel on police presence and campus alcohol policy attended by about 30 students, Riley attributed the increased weekend policing to a need to be more visible and proactive in light of recent violent crimes and disruptions on campus and in final clubs.
“Rumors out there don’t seem to match with reality,” he said. “Our aim is to keep the abuse around here from affecting the neighborhood and safety of the students.”
In a span of five days over the summer, two stranger rapes—the first in 12 years—were reported on campus. Riley also said that at a meeting between HUPD and the graduate and undergraduate boards of finals clubs during the summer, the clubs expressed concerns about people unaffiliated with Harvard trying to get in their buildings.
Riley said that HUPD only plans to arrest partiers in cases of assault or destruction of property, not underage drinking.
“We don’t want students to be implicated in the criminal justice system unless it’s something really violent,” Riley said. “[HUPD officers are] not secret squirrels sneaking around to see who’s drinking beer.”
Though students can expect not to be arrested for drinking, Riley said that they can be reported to College administrators for walking outdoors with open containers of alcohol, which is illegal.
“We ask students to pour it out and take people’s name for review by the College,” he said.
Riley also responded to increased sightings of Cambridge police on campus, saying that they have jurisdiction over anything that happens in the city.
“If there is a noise complaint, the police have the right to intervene,” Riley said.
In addition to probing the likely legal recourse—or lack thereof—against underage drinkers, the panel also probed the College’s own alcohol policy, which was revised last spring.
Under the new guidelines, those of legal drinking age may sip on mixed drinks—alcoholic beverages containing hard liquor—at House formals.
Interim Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich highlighted some of the policy changes, saying that they are meant to help students socialize safely while looking out for the wellbeing of their peers.
According to the policy statement available on the Office of Student Life website, mixed drinks may be served with advance approval from the House Masters and the OSL, and the drinks must include non-alcoholic mixers and contain no more than one standard measure of alcohol.
Friedrich also added that only professional bartenders may mix and serve drinks, and that mixed drinks may only be offered for purchase or by limited drink ticket system.
The alcohol policy also emphasizes safety precautions, such as offering plentiful food and non-alcoholic beverages at parties, limiting the serving time of alcohol to no longer than five hours, and prohibiting activities that promote high-risk drinking—namely drinking games.
“You all are responsible adults,” Friedrich said. “The expectation is that you are going to look out for one another.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WOBURN, Mass.—Brandon J. Winston, a Harvard Law School student charged with sexually assaulting a 24-year-old woman, pleaded not guilty to two counts of indecent assault and battery on Wednesday morning in Middlesex Superior Court.
Winston was indicted last month for inappropriately touching the victim’s breast and vaginal area on Jan. 15, 2011.
At the arraignment, assistant district attorney Marisa Tagliareni said that prosecutors presented six possible charges against Winston at the recent sitting of the grand jury that handed down the indictment. The grand jury indicted Winston for the two counts of indecent assault and battery but did not conclude that there was sufficient evidence of his guilt to indict him for the other four charges, which Tagliareni did not name.
Winston was released on bail following the arraignment.
As conditions of his bail, Winston must have no direct or indirect contact with the victim or any eyewitnesses in the case, must surrender his passport, and must sign a waiver of extradition which would permit Massachusetts authorities to bring him back to the state for trial if he were to leave.
When reached by phone Tuesday night, Winston declined to comment on the indictment.
He instead referred a request for comment to his attorney, Daniel K. Gelb, who wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday night, “Mr. Winston denies any wrongdoing and we do not wish to comment further at this time.”
Winston, Gelb, and Tagliareni did not return requests for comment after the arraignment on Wednesday.
Stephanie Guyotte, a spokesperson for the Middlesex District Attorney's Office, declined to state on Tuesday whether the victim is affiliated with the University.
The Harvard Web Directory lists Winston as a student enrolled in the Law School’s JD program. The directory also includes an email address for Winston that indicates that he enrolled with the Class of 2012, but the Harvard alumni database lists him as set to graduate with the Class of 2013.
Winston’s next court date is scheduled for Nov. 7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball recruit Noah Allen rescinded his verbal commitment to the Crimson and reopened his recruitment on Monday, citing financial aid concerns.
“My family can’t afford 60 grand a year, and that’s what the financial aid people told us it would cost,” Allen said. “It broke my heart. I really wanted to go to Harvard, but the numbers didn’t add up.”
Allen, ranked as the 29th best small forward in this year’s senior class by ESPN, fell in love with Harvard early on in the recruiting process.
“It wasn’t even really about basketball,” Allen said. “The prestige, that’s why I committed.”
The current high school senior committed in late July, following a visit to campus.
“I got there and I fell in love with it,” Allen said. “It wasn’t what I expected, but I knew it was where I wanted to go.”
But Allen's quest to attend Harvard was thwarted at roughly the same time by the financial aid office’s projected contribution package.
“One reason I committed [in July] was that [the financial aid office] said it would cost five or ten percent of my family’s income,” Allen said. “And then they came back [asking for] the whole thing and it caught [my family] off guard a little bit. We just can’t do that. My parents can’t go into debt.”
At that point, Allen tried everything he could to get the office to reconsider their estimate, but to no avail.
“They thought they could get [the price] down, but it just didn’t happen,” Allen said. “We tried everything, but they said, ‘No, we can’t give you anything.’”
Allen, who said he has a 3.9 GPA at Palma School in Salinas, Calif.,  was confident that he would meet the academic requirements needed to  get admitted to Harvard.
But due to financial concerns, he and his family finally concluded Monday that his dream wasn’t going to come true. That night, Allen tweeted, “Doing what I just did sucks.”
This isn’t the first time that the Crimson has lost a prized recruit due to issues of financial aid, as the Ivy League does not allow athletic scholarships. In 2009, Rod Odom Jr., a top 100 prospect in the class of 2012, chose to enroll at Arizona rather than Harvard. He later recommitted to Vanderbilt.
“The thing that prevented Harvard from being in the last two was when we got the financial aid indication, which—compared to a full scholarship—couldn’t be a consideration for us,” Rod Odom Sr. told The Crimson in March.
Allen reportedly holds offers from St. Mary’s, Colorado, San Diego State,  Washington State, Utah, Rice, Santa Clara, and U.C. Davis, as well Ivy  League foes Yale, Penn, and Brown. He had been coach Tommy Amaker's second commited recruit for the future class of 2017, following the March commitment of forward Zena Edosomwan.
According to Allen, Penn has informed him that he would pay  significantly less if he enrolled there—roughly $35,000—but Allen said  he was not sure what his top choice is at this point.
“I’m wide open right now,” Allen said. “I’m back to square one.”
Despite the difficult breakup with Harvard, Allen didn’t have any hard feelings towards for the school.
“I wish [Harvard] the best,” he said.  “I’m just sorry it didn’t work out. When I was there, I loved it. If I had a choice, I’d choose to go there again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a rainy Tuesday night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, the Harvard men’s soccer team jumped out to an early lead on a well-placed header by Crimson sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi. But Boston College answered with a powerful strike from senior Kevin Mejia later in the first half.
Harvard (1-5-3, 0-0-1 Ivy) found itself up a goal before the second minute of play had even ended, but the Crimson was unable to convert later opportunities and was forced to settle for a 1-1 tie against the Eagles (5-3-2, 1-1-1 ACC).
Both teams were unable to score in the remainder of regulation and the two overtime periods, despite a number of chances for both sides. After Kobayashi’s goal, the Crimson had two additional scoring opportunities in the opening minutes but was unable to convert on a header off a lofty cross and a hard volley.
“On the whole, the game was probably a fair result in a tie,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “But I thought we had three opportunities in the first fifteen minutes to be up 3-0, where we should have—not just could have—had three goals.”
The Crimson dominated the opening minutes of the game, threading crisp passes through the BC defense that put the Eagles on their heels. Junior defender Ross Friedman sent a hard cross into the box from near the goal line that Kobayashi, soaring over a BC defender, finished beautifully to net his second goal of the season.
But after the early tally, the Crimson could not put anything in the net, despite a number of looks close to the goal throughout the game.
“We need to work on finishing goals,” Kobayashi said. “I think each individual knows what they need to accomplish to get better.”
Excitement arose in the opening minutes of overtime, as senior defender Richard Smith followed the ball into the Eagles’ penalty box when he was taken down by a BC defender. To the dismay of the Crimson bench, the referee issued no call.
If the referee had blown the whistle, Harvard would have been awarded a penalty kick that could have potentially ended the game.
“Obviously I thought it should have been a penalty; I think a lot of people did,” Junot said. “It’s rare that the ref will make a call like that late in the game. I thought he should have. I thought he missed the call, but you know in any game we say you’ve got to be better than the other team, and you’ve got to be better than the referee.”
“We had our opportunities to be up 3-1, so the message is if we had scored all our goals like we should’ve early in the game, it wouldn’t have mattered,” Junot added.
Boston College had its own chances to take the lead throughout the game. In two similar situations, the Eagles intercepted passes between Harvard defenders around the goal that led to shots, one of which came late in the game and caromed off the crossbar.
But for the majority of the game, the Crimson defense constantly pressured the Eagles and forced turnovers that enabled Harvard to maintain possession.
Junot attributed this defensive success in part to the increasing number of minutes Harvard midfielders and defenders have been playing together.
“Defensively we were good, not perfect, but I think the ability to get some continuity with our back line is important,” Junot said. “We’re finally back to full health with our field players, so we have a healthy rotation of players throughout the game that are able to come in at different times.”
The Eagles finished with a total of 12 shots, while the Crimson tallied nine. Freshman goalie Joe Festa put together his second solid game in a row after shutting out Yale on Saturday.
Boston College makes up just part of Harvard’s competitive nonconference schedule, as the team has already faced a number of top programs including Michigan State and Connecticut. The team hopes that growing accustomed to tough competition will pay off during conference play, especially since the top teams in the Ivy League are among the country’s best.
“Having one of the toughest schedules in the nation has a good side, which is that we’re ready to play any team, including the Ivy schools,” Kobayashi said.
The Crimson faces Cornell in its second Ivy League game of the season this Saturday at home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a loss last weekend at home, the Harvard women’s field hockey team (3-6, 1-2 Ivy) continues its mid-season play Wednesday night against No. 8 Northeastern (8-2, 2-1 CAA), one of the highest ranked field hockey programs in the country.
The Huskies come into the game with the benefit of having one of the top players in the country, Crystal Poland. The key match-up of the game will be between Poland and the Crimson’s co-captain and starting goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos, who have both notched impressive starts to their respective seasons.
Poland has scored 16 of her team’s 28 goals and was ranked third in the CAA last year with 27 goals at the end of the season. She has been named to two All-American teams, and prior to this season was named the 2012 CAA preseason field hockey Player of the Year. Currently, she is averaging 3.5 points and 1.5 assists per game, which has her ranked third in the country.
Harvard, however, isn’t concerned about Poland’s star caliber.
“Personally, I’m excited to be going up against her,” sophomore Noel Painter said. “She’s a fantastic forward and a player, but I think our team is going to be able to shut her down. As a defense and a team we are always able to perform against players and teams of that really high caliber.”
Tassopoulos has similarly posted some of the best stats in the country so far this season. Since the beginning of the campaign, she has averaged a 1.67 goals-against average (25th best in the country) and 7.71 saves per game (13th in the country).  Her 0.818 save percentage is also good enough to rank as fifth-best in the country.
“It’s always a motivation when [Cynthia] gets a great save,” Painter said. “It lets everyone know we need to get [the ball] out of our defensive 25 and get on the attack so that she doesn’t have to make another save. But she’s been incredibly clutch so far this season in net.”
The Crimson is facing an opponent that is nationally ranked and currently 8-2 in all play, including a 5-1 record away. Conversely, Harvard holds a 2-4 record playing in front of its home crowd. But more than that, Northeastern holds a reputation for being a tough competitor year in and year out.
“We do know from experience that Northeastern’s always a good team, and this year’s no different,” Tassopoulos said. “We know to expect a really high-paced game against an opponent that’s skilled. We’re not really looking at their record, but we already know that Northeastern is going to be a strong competitor.”
The Crimson is coming off a 3-1 loss to Quinnipiac last Sunday, winning their previous two games before that. Harvard is looking to bounce back from the defeat, continuing to improve on its season and build off of its strengths.
“We need to come out with the same energy that we’ve come out with before,” Tassopoulos said. “If we focus on ourselves and our strengths, and if we can continue to grow, then I think we’ll have a competitive team.”
The Crimson’s offense has been helped out by point contributions from almost half of the team, with eight different players netting goals in nine games. Painter currently leads Harvard with nine points and four goals, with sophomore Caitlin Rea in second with six points and four assists. Senior Emma Keller has scored two goals and has contributed five points. Freshman Elizabeth Jacobson has also tallied one goal and one assist, and was named last week’s Ivy League Co-Rookie of the Week.
For the Huskies, Poland has been helped out by teammates Lindsay Bennett and Nicky Graham, who have combined for three goals and nine assists. In net, Lizzie Priest has started every game and played all but five minutes, averaging 2.37 goals-against and a 0.716 save percentage.
The two teams met in the regular season last year when the Huskies won 1-0 despite 18 saves from Tassopoulos. The Crimson has lost the last three match-ups against Northeastern, winning its last meeting back in 2008, running the overall record between the two teams to 23-13 in favor of the Huskies. But when Harvard is playing at home, the series is tied at ten games apiece.
And even with the looming matchup with Poland and Northeastern, the Crimson is looking to improve as a team on the field.
“We can tell that certain things on the field are starting to click,” Tassopoulos said. “It’s still encouraging for us even if we don’t necessarily get the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior co-captain Peyton Johnson set up the free kick, stepped up, and curled the ball to freshman forward Emily Mosbacher, who was waiting on the back post. Mosbacher leaped and headed the ball into the top right of the net. The 52nd-minute strike, Mosbacher’s second score of the year, gave the Harvard women’s soccer team (5-3-2, 1-1 Ivy) a lead it would never relinquish in a 2-1 victory at New Hampshire (3-8-2, 1-1-1 America East) on Tuesday night.
The win was the Crimson’s second straight following Saturday’s victory over Yale.
“Another game in the win column is always a great thing for the team, especially at this point in the season because every game matters so much,” said Johnson, who leads the team with nine points.
More important than the win, though, is that the team is beginning to gel and build momentum, according to Johnson.
“We definitely wanted to continue an upward trajectory leading into the weekend,” Johnson said. “The goal was to come up strong and to get good chances. We had been having some trouble scoring, but today we got some good shots and were able to capitalize in some good spots.”
Tuesday’s contest marked the first time since Harvard’s Sept. 12 game at Quinnipiac that the Crimson tallied multiple goals in a match. The team, said junior Elizabeth Weisman, sees this as a reflection of its offensive strategy.
“It was obviously nice to get a couple goals today,” Weisman said. “We came out and tried to do what we usually do, which is create a lot of chances [to score]. Today, we were able to get goals, which is very exciting.”
Harvard was able to create opportunities by adjusting to the Wildcat defense and the wet field, explained Johnson.
“We had our best chances when we calmed down and possessed the ball,” Johnson said. “It was a wet, slippery game, and when we played direct, it wasn’t working for us. When we settled down and found each other’s feet and were able to stay composed, then we created good chances.”
It took a while for the Crimson to settle down, though, as New Hampshire controlled the early part of the game and struck first.
At 27:00, Wildcat midfielder Tara Fraprie dribbled into the left side of the box and knocked the ball past Harvard sophomore goalkeeper Cheta Emba, who was filling in for starter Bethany Kanten.
But the Crimson did not wait long to answer New Hampshire’s goal. Five substitutes entered the game for Harvard after the Wildcat score and made an immediate impact. In the 37th minute, Weisman, a substitute, passed it to Mosbacher, who took on a defender and drew the foul in the box. Johnson, a recent reentry, took the ensuing penalty kick and drilled the ball past New Hampshire goalkeeper Erin Jackson and into the back of the net.
Although many reserves took the field on Tuesday night, the Crimson’s chemistry was not affected.
“We got a lot of different people on the field, and we were able to maintain the rhythm on the field no matter who was in the game,” Johnson said. “It’s a great thing for our team chemistry because we know we can put anyone out there and still stay connected.”
Harvard coach Ray Leone decided to rest sophomore goalkeeper Kanten, but Emba was able to carry the team and stabilize the back end.
“Cheta played awesome,” Weisman said. “She talks a lot and communicates well, which makes everyone on the field feel really comfortable because she knows what’s going on. She’s our support on the back end, and she did really well today.”
Emba made several crucial second-half stops to preserve the Crimson lead en route to a career-high seven saves. She saved chances by Kristi Zarilli (53:08) and Gabrielle Sloan (76:59), and helped the visiting team survive despite being out-shot nine to four by the Wildcats in the second half.
New Hampshire out-shot Harvard 18-13 for the match, and held an eight-seven advantage on shots on goal.
The Wildcats had a few chances in the waning minutes to even the score, but Madeline Christ’s shot at 89:05 sailed over the crossbar and Monique Lamotte’s attempt 30 seconds later missed wide.
“The win was definitely great, given that we weren’t at our best,” Johnson said. “The conditions were different, and it really helps our confidence to get a win even though we weren’t playing at 100 percent. To come away with a victory proves that we can do it even if we’re not clicking. We won’t lose faith and will battle it out until the end.”

For those desperate times when you find yourself tamponless, padless, and entirely helpless (and wearing white jeans), Olenka M. Polak '15 has come up with a better solution than hiding behind a sweater tied tactfully around the waist. Her proposed iPhone app, dubbed Code Red and currently under development, aims to create a tampon exchange network to connect girls in need with the nearest free tampon or pad. Users will be rewarded with "tampon points" or "craving coupons" for every time they come to the aid of a Code Red request.
"The nature of this idea is funky," Polak said. "We know how big of a joke this is, and we want people to embrace that." The app itself adopts a light-hearted tone; for example, when a user sends out a Code Red request and needs to specify her location for potential tampon donors, Code Red asks, "Girl, where are you?"
Polak originally pitched the idea last Friday at a StartUp Scramble™ hosted by Young Impact, a startup company that encourages entrepreneurialism. Since then, she has brought together a team of programmers to work on a prototype and has contacted businesses about implementing a system to redeem "tampon points" for things like ice cream (or, of course, more tampons). Code Red has also partnered with Momba, a new series of vending machines being installed at Harvard which provide necessities such as red Solo cups, ping pong balls, and condoms. Polak predicts that the Code Red app could even be launched within the next two weeks.
The tampon industry has not, as of yet, branched out into the mobile world and taken advantage of the vast social networks created by modern technology. Ultimately, Polak hopes to create a heightened feeling of community and solidarity among women at Harvard and eventually in a larger sphere as well.
"I love finding something small and special, and showing people what there can be out of it," Polak said. "It's weird, it's uncomfortable, and it makes people giggle nervously. We are going to capitalize on that."

If we're lucky, tonight's debate between President Barack Obama (a Harvard Law School grad) and Republican nominee Mitt Romney (who holds a joint J.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School) will serve up some memorable one-liners, a couple of zingers, and maybe even a few cringe-worthy faux pas. But before the candidates give their opening arguments, here are five things we wouldn't mind seeing tonight, based on some of the most notable debate moments of years past.
A One-Sided Train Wreck
During the very first televised debate in 1960, Richard Nixon set the standard for how to look like a hot mess. In reality, he was more of a cold, clammy, perspiring mess, and it didn't help that his opponent, John F. Kennedy '40, looked like cool combination of Cary Grant and a Ken doll.
 
Faulty Information
 
Nothing is more fascinating or troubling than watching a candidate try to fudge the facts, and nothing quite compares to Gerald Ford's declaration during a 1976 debate that, "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe." Moderator Max Frankel's befuddled response ("I'm sorry, what?...") says it all.
 
Historical Allusions
Digging up the past always spices up a debate, especially when the past comes back and bites you in the butt. A certain Senator Dan "Potatoe" Quayle learned this lesson all too well during the 1988 Vice Presidential debate. When Quayle, comparing his youthful self to John F. Kennedy, tried to school opponent Lloyd Bentsen on the older senator's own period of history, Bentsen had a few words for the young grasshopper: "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."
Awkwardness
 
 The Harvard hug that never was? We're not quite sure what exactly Al Gore '69 was going for when he abruptly stood up and approached George W. Bush (HBS '75) during a 2000 presidential debate—maybe he was looking to share some Crimson loving with his opponent? We hope tonight's debaters will have better luck. The president's track record with middle aged white guys seems to be in Mr. Romney's favor.
 
A Little Bit of Sass
You could say that then-Senator Barack Obama started it when he told Hillary Clinton that she was "likable enough" during a January 2008 primary debate. But when Obama was called to defend himself against accusations that he had plagiarized parts of his speeches, Clinton wasted no time in dishing out a memorable, "That's not change you can believe in, that's change you can Xerox." Obama didn't appreciate the swipe, but we hear he's doing all right these days. Clinton, for her part, may not have won the election, but four years later, she's Secretary of State and arguably a lot more likable.
Regardless of what happens tonight, things are bound to go better than they did in 1940, when Republican candidate Wendell Willkie challenged Franklin D. Roosevelt '04 to a debate and was promptly rejected by the President. Some things (like a President Wendell Willkie) just aren't meant to be.

Arguments with empty chairs. Naked swims in the Sea of Galilee. Rick Santorum.
This election season is liable to drive just about anyone to the bottle.
Though we'd all love to be sitting on a beach in the Cayman Islands, sipping a mai tai and managing Mitt Romney's bank accounts, Flyby presents all of us in damp Cambridge a drinking game to keep you sane during tonight's candidate clash:
47 percent, 100 proof: Every time either candidate cites a percentage (e.g. "I will represent 100 percent of Americans," "8.1 percent of our country is out of work," "47 percent of the country are parasitic moochers who I personally detest") drink that portion of your current beverage.  
Hawks and Chugs: Throw back the local spirit for whatever country Mitt Romney threatens to start a war with. Shot of Stoli when he calls Russia our major geopolitical foe. Snifter of baijiu whenever he deems China a currency manipulator. Iran, as a sober theocracy, presents a challenge. Instead, honor their petro-economy by taking a shot of gasoline/turpentine/Rubinoff.  
(Toned) Body Politic: Whenever gay marriage is brought up, celebrate your lack of homophobia by taking a body shot off of a member of the same sex. It's only awkward if you make it awkward, bigots.
Man of the People: Take a sip of your favorite mass-market domestic lager every time either candidate tries to empathize with the struggling working man. Everyone knows you could share a brew with Dubya, but what about these two?
Optional: increase your intake based off how far back in time their references to the working man go. Two drinks for George Romney or for "Mama Obama" Ann Dunham, a pint of Guinness for Obama's Irish great-great-grandfather, and a 40 oz of Corona for Romney's fleeing-to-Mexico polygamist grandparents.
Veri-tasty: Believe it or not, there is a cocktail named after our fair alma mater: The Harvard cocktail consists of 1.5 oz of cognac, 1 oz of vermouth, and a couple dashes of bitters poured into a martini glass with club soda. Every time either candidate runs away from his ties to everyone's favorite ivory tower, make and consume one of these cocktails in as refined and elitist a way as possible.
Bonus: make a condescending remark about the welfare state while doing this.
Mormon-tini: Should the moderator bring up Mitt Romney's Mormon religion—which bans the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine—sip a Diet 7-Up while playing board games in the nearest rumpus room. If this is not feasible, you can, alternatively, throw back a double vodka-Red Bull while chain-smoking and blaspheming.
If you've somehow made it to the end of the debate, congratulations! Celebrate by drinking until you're no longer terrified about the country's future.
