After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The December 11 issue of The New Yorker featured “Cat Person,” a short story by Kristen Roupenian. “Cat Person” reads as an extended interior monologue of Margot, a college-aged woman whose flirtation with thirty-four-year-old Robert becomes something much darker. It is one of few works of short fiction in the recent past to have trended on Twitter, mostly for its “relatable” take on the dating experiences of millennial women—namely, the uncertainty, the danger, and the constant need to cater to men’s needs.
However, others criticized the story, claiming that Margot’s descriptions of Robert’s body as “thick and soft and covered with hair” were fatphobic, and that Margot herself was vapid and egotistical. From a purely aesthetic standpoint, its language was sparse, unlovely, blunt—one Twitter user likened it to the kind of fiction Lena Dunham’s character in “Girls” might have produced. Yes, “Cat Person” voices the concerns of women who date men. But the story only amplifies a certain kind of voice: middle class, college-educated, and most likely white. Her experience is not representative of a woman of color—had Margot been black, or Asian, or Latinx, her story would have been very different. Would she have joked so flippantly about the possibility that Robert could have murdered her? Would her friends have protected her in the same way when she encountered Robert again at the bar? Would Robert have treated her differently? It’s difficult to say. Part of me wonders, too, if such a story would even gain the same amount of online traction.
On Harvard’s campus, we interact daily with privilege. Wealth, class, and race regularly impact the way we act, make friends, and yes, date. Privilege affects whether we go to parties, what parties we go to, the spaces where we feel comfortable, and the spaces where we are unwelcome. We attend a university that champions inclusivity and diversity, whose red flags in the Yard read, “Wherever you are from… You are Harvard.”
But it is also a multi-billion dollar enterprise and a storied academic institution that only opened its doors to people of color in the past hundred years and women in the past fifty. Last year, the Harvard men’s soccer team was barred from playing for the remainder of the season when a list certain members of the team had compiled of the women’s team, ranking them by attractiveness, came to light. A few weeks later, the cross country team was penalized for keeping a similar list. Each student wants to find a home here, but it can be difficult to reconcile the idealism of Harvard’s message and the hostility of some of its realities. Privilege, as “Cat Person” reminds us, works both behind closed doors and out in the open, whether we recognize it or not.
“Cat Person” comes in the wake of a string of Hollywood sexual assault and harassment scandals, beginning with Harvey Weinstein and going on to implicate Louis C.K., Kevin Spacey, and Matt Lauer—men with means, power, and in most cases, sound reputations. There is a reason we feel so blindsided when these stories of assault materialize: the abuse of power feels like betrayal. It becomes personal. Broadly, the story of “Cat Person” is about power—about what benefits it can confer, and at whose expense. It is about who gets to exercise power, and who must face its consequences. Indeed, Margot’s struggle to articulate her disinterest to Robert amounts to more than discomfort, more than awkwardness. It is an overt struggle for dominance. “Cat Person” reminds us that privilege is not just a definition in a sociology textbook, but a perpetual and pervasive force that, whether we are conscious of it or not, governs our interactions and our place in the world. To some degree, we can view ourselves as Margot, navigating the complicated world of privilege and trying to assert our own control. But in other ways, we might even recognize attributes that align with Robert, perhaps obliviously wielding power in a damaging and dangerous way.
The role of fiction is ultimately not to offer moralistic fables starring exemplary people. It is also not to vilify the people we don’t like. Rather, fiction is supposed to identify what makes us human—to explore even the awkward, weird, and sometimes problematic parts of ourselves. And it’s there to unearth the stories that make us tick and give them a voice. But perhaps most importantly, fiction is meant to amplify the voices of the marginalized, even when what they have to say makes us uncomfortable. And as readers, it is our job to listen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alan M. Toda-Ambaras ’13 is a lifelong cellist whose passion lies at the intersection of classical music and social justice. The recipient of the Prize for Most Promising Contestant at the 2005 Rostropovich International Cello Competition in Paris, Toda-Ambaras has worked with many of the world’s leading classical ensembles and performers. Most recently, he co-founded the Eureka Ensemble, a Boston-based group dedicated to using classical music to connect with underprivileged and marginalized communities locally.
The Harvard Crimson: You attended Harvard as an undergraduate. What was your academic background during those years? 
Alan M. Toda-Ambaras: I was enrolled in the joint degree program between Harvard and the New England Conservatory. I did my bachelor’s through that program in History of Art and Architecture (HAA) and I got my master’s in cello performance. 
THC: Do you feel that this background prepared you well for the type of projects that you’ve taken on with the Eureka Ensemble?
AMT: To a great extent, yes. We have to be very comfortable integrating different aspects of our lives. It works in a pretty interdisciplinary way with how our music works, and relates to the same issues in other areas of our lives, and how we can apply our artistic knowledge and background to societal wrongs. Being in the program helped me to start thinking about those larger questions.
THC: How did the Eureka Ensemble come about?
AMT: The Eureka Ensemble is a loosely defined association of musicians in the Boston area—mostly young professionals—very heavily drawing from the New England Conservatory. The mission of the group is focused on helping underserved communities in the Greater Boston area through interactive and otherwise performative events. When we talk about underserved communities, we’re not just talking about economically underserved—also physically handicapped audiences and folks who, for one reason or another, just didn’t have much exposure to classical music.
The group started when my colleague and co-founder Christo Kondakçi and I got together. He has a lot of experience doing outreach work in underserved communities through his position at the Boston Landmarks Orchestra and the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, for which he is a conductor. I overlapped with him at the New England Conservatory, at a time when I was doing entrepreneurial work in the music world as well through a group called Project Lens. Project Lens is comprised, coincidentally, of two other Harvard-NEC joint concentrators.
That would take a whole other conversation to get into that group’s history, but essentially Christo and I were both thinking about a few ways to both engage audiences and do something that was impactful and could make a difference, and give new meaning to our art form in the modern age given all the problems that we have in society today. That’s how we got started. That’s kind of our mission.
THC: Could you speak to how the group aims to achieve these goals of community engagement and social awareness?
AMT: A big part of it, from my perspective and I’m pretty sure Christo’s as well, is that we place a great deal of emphasis on community partnerships and organizational partnerships. So for this most recent Chelsea program that was put together, we reached out to the Chelsea Collaborative, to a group dedicated to reaching out to the local immigrant community and doing social justice work there. We also partnered with the local synagogue that was trying to transition from being a religious institution towards being more of a civic institution, since they have an immigration museum dedicated to exploring the history of the Jewish community in Chelsea.
We kind of tied those two organizations together and came up with a program that could be for the local community, immigrant and otherwise, but paying special attention to the immigrants and refugees of Chelsea and the pretty huge population of people who ended up there. That’s an essential part of what we do—creating these partnerships with organizations that are also dedicated to advocacy work or advancement for marginalized people or a cause. We do that in the context of great music-making and bringing young professionals into this world. 
THC: Do you ever find that there’s tension between the music-making goals of the ensemble and those social goals? If so, how do you navigate it?
AMT: I think that part of the reason why Christo and I started this group was because there was tension. I mean, there are many angles from which you can look at it. But basically, in the classical music world in particular (I can’t speak for other genres, although I do think it is also prevalent in at least one other genre of music) there is a tendency to be a little closed-off and not always in touch with the daily lives of those who can’t afford to go to concerts or who weren’t brought up in a culture in which classical music was important. I might add here that Christo and I or anyone throughout the team don’t promote classical music as above all other art forms—it’s just our medium.
But, because we are classical musicians and we do have a certain awareness of that scene, so to speak, it’s nice to open it up and give professional musicians or aspiring professional musicians an opportunity to connect the music work with those developing causes. I think that’s both the tension, the challenge, and the promise. 
THC: So what are some of your goals for the ensemble for the future?
AMT: Long-term, I think it would be great if what we’re doing as this fledgling organization can become more of a model for musicians everywhere. We’re not reinventing the wheel here and there are a lot of pre-existing groups that have also started performing and developing causes or doing innovative, entrepreneurial things. But it would be nice if we could contribute to this movement in a way that would accelerate the emergence of that model of music and social action combined.
So that’s the long-term goal, but both short-term and long-term it would be nice to see us kind of getting a foothold in all of the communities in and around Boston, underprivileged and otherwise, and simultaneously giving professional musicians a chance to advance their careers and do things that are meaningful to them because in a way (my colleague Christo loves saying this, and I agree with him) young musicians are kind of an underserved community of their own. That’s our thinking at the moment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s more than 5,000 cows are about to change hands.
Harvard Management Company—the investment management team that oversees Harvard’s endowment—is selling the University’s dairy farms in the Otago region of New Zealand for $74 million, according to the New Zealand Herald.
Pending approval by New Zealand’s Overseas Investment Office, the deal will move roughly 5,500 cows and 8,500 acres of farmland to Dairy Otago Holdings Ltd, a New Zealand company partially owned by a Singapore-based investor. The application was filed in August 2017, according to investment office communications officer Joanna Carr, and will likely be reviewed by next June.
Harvard spent years amassing the New Zealand farmland, with much of the land acquired when Harvard purchased Big Sky Dairy Farm in 2010 for about $20 million. Andrew G. Wiltshire, a New Zealander who formerly worked for the New Zealand forest service, oversaw the purchase when he was managing director and head of alternative assets at HMC.
The latest deal follows speculation in June 2017 that the private equity firm KKR was planning to purchase Harvard’s bovine investments amid poor returns on Harvard’s natural resource assets.
In fiscal year 2016, natural resources comprised 10 percent of the University’s $35.7 billion endowment but returned negative 10.2 percent, meaning it ranked among the lowest-performing asset classes owned by the University. In the 2017 financial report, HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar wrote the natural resource assets will continue to be internally managed but “will take multiple years to reposition.”
David L. Yermack ’85, former Managing Editor of The Crimson and chair of the finance department at New York University Stern, said he thinks Harvard’s investment in exotic assets, like New Zealand dairy farms, is unconventional and a poor strategy.
“I think Harvard has been overconfident in its ability to manage an exotic investment portfolio,” Yermack said. “And I think a lot of this has boomeranged back to hurt them.”
According to Yermack, most endowments invest in natural resources indirectly through a combination of stocks and bonds. Yermack said he thinks Harvard’s endowment, too, could perform better with a simpler combination of stocks and bonds.
“Simple is better. Diversification is the rule,” Yermack said. “It’s funny how we teach these things in first year finance to freshman college students, but at the highest level these lessons often get forgotten by the genius managers.”
Carr wrote that the timeline for approval by the New Zealand’s Overseas Investment Office depends on factors like the “complexity of the application, the need for further information and the time it takes for applicants to respond to these requests.”
A spokesperson from Harvard Management Company declined to comment.
