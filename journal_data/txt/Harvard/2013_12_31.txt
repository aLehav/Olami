From bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon to bomb threats in four campus buildings, life at Harvard was anything but calm in 2013. Scandals erupted over secret email searches as well as high grades. Students and alumni celebrated a first-ever NCAA Tournament victory for the men’s basketball team but also the launch of a record-seeking capital campaign. And while the Dean of Harvard College resigned, students elected a joke ticket to run the Undergraduate Council. As Harvard’s too-crazy-to-believe year draws to a close, The Crimson looks back at ten stories that most shaped life on campus in 2013.
On April 15, over 100 Harvard administrators, staff, and students made their way across the river to participate and watch the Boston Marathon, one of the nation’s, and the city’s, top athletic events. Around 2:50 p.m., an explosion near the finish line on Boylston Street interrupted the cheers and shouts of recovering runners and spectators. Seconds later, another explosion went off a block away, filling Copley Square with screams from onlookers and sirens from emergency vehicles careening down Boylston Street to aid the more than 200 injured and three who would later die. By the week’s end, a city-wide lockdown and manhunt had paralyzed the greater Boston area and brought members of the Harvard community within miles of suspected terrorists—one who was a former University employee.
Within minutes, news of the attacks hit Harvard. Immediately, administrators tapped into the University’s crisis management structure, and, along with House staff and students, worked to track down Harvard affiliates potentially trapped in the crisis. Though law enforcement authorities ultimately deemed Harvard Square safe, concern about the possibility of further attacks triggered the evacuation of the John F. Kennedy School of Government and frequent investigations by the Cambridge Police Department into “suspicious packages” on public streets. For much of the afternoon and evening, members of the Harvard community exchanged suspicions and updates about the explosions, gathered in common spaces around campus, and waited—many say too long—for news from administrators.
While investigators continued the search for suspects and campus life began to resume its normal pace, a fatal shooting at MIT around 11 p.m. Thursday evening jolted Harvard back into high alert. Police cars raced across the streets of Cambridge in pursuit of the two men who had shot the MIT officer and were now driving away in a stolen car: Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, then 19, a former University lifeguard, and his brother Tamerlan. By morning, law enforcement authorities had concluded that the brothers were the top suspects in the Marathon bombing investigation and that Tamerlan had died in an early morning shoot-out, leaving Dzhokhar at large somewhere in or near neighboring Watertown.
Though many Harvard affiliates had stayed awake watching news broadcasts and tuning into police scanners for the latest updates on the chase, others woke up on Friday morning, April 19, to find that much of the Boston area was under lockdown and that the University had closed for the day, as municipal, state, and federal law enforcement authorities searched a 20-block area for the suspect still at large. The closure was Harvard’s third during the 2012-2013 school year but only the fourth in 35 years.
After a day under lockdown and heightened alert, members of the Harvard community rejoiced when, at 8:45 p.m., FBI officials captured Dzhokhar just outside the designated search area in a Watertown backyard.
When all was said and done, the unprecedented chaos of the week had prompted the mobilization of the Harvard community to keep its campus safe and operable, from administrators to police officers, to students standing in for staff unable to make it into work. And with the cancellation of Visitas, the College’s preview weekend for admitted students, administrators launched a Virtual Visitas on social media to engage prospective students. During and after the week, members of the Harvard community attended and held vigils on campus and in Boston to commemorate the over 250 injuries and the 3 fatalities, including that of a former Business School employee, a victim of the deadly, pressure cooker-based, shrapnel-laced explosions.
With the casebook closed on the Government 1310 cheating case and the spring semester safely underway, it seemed by early March that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences was returning to normalcy after the largest cheating scandal in memory. But on the evening of March 9, a Saturday, the Boston Globe ran a story saying Harvard administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of resident deans in hopes of identifying a possible leak of information related to the Gov. 1310 case. As insight into the searches unfolded in the coming months, the secret query became a scandal in its own right, one that eventually led to a review of the resident dean position, a loss of trust within the Faculty, and some believe, the resignation of one of Harvard’s top deans.
News of the searches and questions of administrative ethics rippled through the faculty and the student body the day after the Globe story ran online. On Mon., March 11, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds released a joint-statement offering an explanation of how and why the searches were executed, while also suggesting that administrators had followed existing protocol to conduct the searches of the resident deans’ administrative email accounts. The statement, which stood for nearly a month as the official administrative stance, proved to be erroneous. On April 2, at the monthly FAS faculty meeting, Hammonds said that, in fact, acting alone she had authorized a second, more invasive round of searches into a single resident dean’s administrative and faculty email accounts, breaking FAS privacy policy.
At the April meeting, University president Drew G. Faust commissioned both an external investigation of the actions taken in the search and a task force to review existing policy on electronic communications across the University. Students and faculty alike mourned the breakdown in communication and trust between administrators and those they govern. On April 4, The Crimson editorial board wrote an editorial calling for Hammonds’s resignation and at their May meeting, members of FAS lodged complaint after complaint against administrators related to faculty governance. Meanwhile, The Crimson reported on April 9 that the resident dean identified by administrators as having forwarded what they considered confidential Administrative Board information at the center of the search was threatened with severe sanctions.
On May 17, The Crimson broke the news that Hammonds would resign as dean at the school year’s end. On May 28, the eve of Commencement, Smith made the news official. Hammonds denied that her decision to step down was related to the scandal. In July, the independent investigation into the incident, the Keating Report, found that the account given by Hammonds and Smith after the April 2 meeting was correct, save the fact the Hammonds had notified Smith of the second, policy-breaking round of searches by email. Smith later said he opened the email but did not closely read it. By the time students and faculty returned to campus for the fall semester, though, controversy over the searches had all but died. The email policy task force commissioned by Faust is expected to give recommendations for a new policy sometime this winter.
Nearly a month after the Boston Globe broke news that Harvard administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of its resident deans, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds stood before assembled members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to tell them that the account administrators had been telling was incomplete and that she was to blame. By the school year’s end, she had resigned and an interim dean was at the helm of the College in her place.
Hammonds and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith released a joint statement on March 11, just two days after the Globe’s story, explaining the circumstances and justification surrounding the early September searches. They wrote that those searches had been limited to the deans’ administrative accounts and that no further action was taken against the single dean identified by the query. However, at the monthly FAS faculty meeting on April 2, Hammonds revealed that acting alone and in violation of FAS email privacy policy, she had authorized a second, more invasive set of searches on the accounts of the single resident dean. What’s more, The Crimson reported a week later that the dean in question was in fact threatened with severe sanctions for forwarding the original email that spawned the search.
On April 4, The Crimson’s editorial board called on Hammonds to resign. For more than a month neither Hammonds nor Smith commented on the searches or the April 2 revelation. On May 17, The Crimson broke the news that Hammonds was in negotiations to step down at the school year’s end, a development that was confirmed eleven days later by Smith in an email to the Harvard community.
On July 9, more than a week after Hammonds had officially left University Hall and ended her five-year tenure as dean, Smith named botany professor Donald H. Pfister interim Dean of the College. Pfister—a longtime professor, Dean of Harvard Summer School, former Kirkland House master, and the chair of the committee that reviewed the Administrative Board from 2008-2010—said that his goal as dean would be to build community and better marry College and academic life by strengthening the relationship between undergraduates and their dean. To that end, Pfister became known among undergraduates during the fall semester for his folksy email updates and book recommendations.
Meanwhile, in September, Smith formed an advisory body of 21 professors and House masters to help conduct the search for Hammonds’s permanent replacement. The search process, which was ongoing throughout the fall, brought various aspects of the position into question as Smith asked students and faculty members what they hoped to see in a College dean. A new dean is expected to be named sometime in the spring.
Backroom whispers became anticipatory cheers in Sanders Theatre in September as Harvard kicked off the five-year public phase of its university-wide capital campaign and set a fundraising goal of $6.5 billion that surpassed both its own historic ambitions and those of its peer institutions. “It is up to us to make sure that we continue to build, to lead, to advance in a world almost unimaginably different from the one our founders inhabited nearly four centuries ago,” Faust said in her campaign launching remarks.
The launch of The Harvard Campaign attracted prominent donors and alumni from around the world, featuring a faculty panel, speeches from campaign staff and University leadership, and a question-and-answer session with famous Harvard College dropout Bill Gates.
The public launch, which concluded the campaign’s multiyear “quiet phase” of soliciting donors and gauging alumni support, marked the beginning of a massive, coordinated effort to raise funds for University-wide priorities that include teaching and learning, bolstering financial aid, advancing HarvardX, and promoting sustainability on campus. A string of big gifts in the last few years helped big-ticket projects like House renewal and the impending move of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston get under way. But the pace of announcements quickened this fall as administrators announced campaign gifts for the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, the Graduate School of Design, and the Smith Campus Center—the University’s first ever campus center, which is slated to open in 2018—among others.
Along with these priorities, each school has an individualized set of goals and many, including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the School of Public Health, and the GSD, hosted their own star-studded launches this fall. In 2014, the remaining schools will host launches and the University is expected to continue to announce high-profile donations and other campaign developments as it adds on to the more than $3 billion already in the coffers.
Final examinations were beginning as usual shortly after 9 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 16 when alarms began to sound in four campus buildings. Test takers and administrators in the Science Center, as well as Thayer, Emerson, and Sever halls, were forced to evacuate and relocate as authorities swept in to investigate the threat of explosives placed in each building. By the next evening, the threats had proven to be empty and a Harvard sophomore was behind bars.
An affidavit filed with the U.S. District Attorney’s Office on Tuesday, Dec. 17, showed that Eldo Kim ’16, a Quincy House resident, had emailed University administrators, the Harvard University Police Department, and the president of The Crimson on Monday morning, saying that explosives had been placed in two of the four buildings and would detonate shortly. The threat, Kim later told law enforcement authorities, was meant to get him out of his own 9 a.m. exam in Emerson Hall. Shortly after Kim sent the email, his plan had worked.
Hundreds of students scheduled to take tests in the evacuated buildings found their exams postponed or rescheduled as administrators scrambled to accommodate those displaced by the threats. Many students were given the opportunity to let their partial grade stand or to take the final in the spring pass/fail. However, even as local, and then state and federal authorities rushed onto campus and the national media took notice, the threats proved unfounded. One by one, the four evacuated buildings were cleared for entry, the Yard reopened, and students displaced to Annenberg Hall and other locations allowed to return to life as normal.
That night, the FBI and other authorities traced the masked emailed threats to Kim and obtained a confession in his Quincy dormitory. Kim, a former peace essay winner and a part of many campus publications, appeared in the U.S. District Court in Boston on Dec. 18 and was released on bail. He could face up to five years in prison, three years of probationary release, and a $250,000 fine if convicted under the federal bomb hoax statute, though the prosecution said it was working with the defendant’s lawyers to find alternatives to detention. Kim is currently under the supervision of his uncle and sister, who were appointed as his guardians by the court.
When the Undergraduate Council Election Commission announced in early November that three sets of candidates were vying for the positions of UC President and Vice President, all the pieces seemed to be in place for another normal election cycle. Yet just a month later on Dec. 8, after unpredictable voting mishaps, resignations, and a special election, the UC inaugurated two vice presidential candidates from separate tickets. Once part of opposing tickets, Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15 will hold the offices of UC President and UC Vice President, respectively, for the coming year.
The three tickets began officially campaigning for undergraduate votes on Nov. 13. The two serious tickets—C.C. Gong ’15 and Goffard, and Chika-Dike Nwokike ’15 and Una Kim ’15—drew from their experience on the Council and put forth similar campaign platforms. While the members of the joke ticket, Sam B. Clark ’15 and Mayopoulos, set out on a different path, focusing on promises of tomato basil ravioli soup and two-ply toilet paper, joke tickets were common occurrences in past UC elections.
Then on the night of Nov. 18, hours after voting began and the three tickets formally debated, the Election Commission notified the candidates that due to an inadvertent error, the Commission had not allowed voters to rank all three tickets, as the rules mandated. While online voting was still live, the Commission and candidates decided to change the vote counting system to a plurality method, in which only a plurality of votes is required for a ticket to claim victory. With the error in the background, the joke campaign surged in popularity on social media in the final days of the election and garnered more Facebook page “likes” than its contenders, but Gong and Goffard nabbed many of the highly sought-after student group endorsements.
After votes were tallied, the Election Commission announced that with a plurality of votes—all that was necessary under the changed vote tabulation rules—Clark and Mayopoulos had edged out second-place finishers Gong and Goffard to win the election. Just minutes later, the duo said that they would resign from their newly-elected positions “as soon as we can.”
At the time of their resignation, UC Bylaws only provided for the situation when a sitting UC President and UC Vice President resigned their positions. Anticipating the possibility that Clark and Mayopoulos would refuse to be inaugurated, the Council voted to amend the bylaws to allow for the UC President-elect and UC Vice President-elect to vacate their positions. Later that same night, less than a week before the scheduled inauguration, Mayopoulos publicly announced that he had changed his mind: he would not resign from his elected position. With Clark still intending to step down, UC rules dictated that Mayopoulos would now be UC President-elect, leaving the UC Vice President-elect position to be filled by an internal UC vote. At the Dec. 8 UC meeting, representatives nominated Goffard and an unexpected challenger, former UC Secretary Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16, for consideration by the Council. The Council elected Goffard after an hour of deliberations, finalizing the UC leadership for 2014.
Harvard basketball’s march through uncharted territory was expected to slow in 2012-2013. Yet, a season beginning in turmoil ended later in March than ever before.
The Crimson had reached progressively loftier heights in each of its previous three seasons entering the fall of 2012, but the preseason departure of the team’s two co-captains in connection with the Government 1310 cheating scandal dropped Harvard from clear favorite to just one of multiple contenders in the Ivy League championship race. A freshman point guard, a short bench, and just one senior were left to fight for a third-straight conference title.
But Harvard found a way. Surprising success from then-freshman point guard Siyani T. Chambers ’16 and the emergence of then-sophomore center Kenyatta A. Smith ’15 during a crucial weekend in February kept Harvard near the top of the Ivy standings. Two late-season losses by Princeton sent the Crimson dancing again. Harvard’s third straight Ivy championship earned it a 14-seed in the NCAA Tournament and a matchup with the third seed in the West Region, the University of New Mexico.
The Crimson entered the game as a double-digit underdog but jumped out to a 9-2 lead and maintained an advantage for nearly the entire game. Then-sophomore Wesley S. Saunders ’15 scored 18 and then-junior captain Laurent Rivard ’14 hit five three-pointers as Harvard busted millions of brackets with a 68-62 victory. It proved to be the Crimson’s most important game of the year and, indeed, recent program history. The team’s season ended two days later with a 74-51 loss to Arizona, but the 2012-13 Crimson had already achieved another Harvard milestone, notching the team’s first-ever NCAA Tournament win.
At the December meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris was put on the spot by government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, who during the meeting’s question period asked administrators to reveal the grade distribution at Harvard College. Harris’s uneasy answer—that the median grade at the College is an A- and that the mode is a straight A—quieted the room and attracted the attention of media outlets around the world.
After Harris’s disclosure, a Harvard official interviewed by The Crimson said that not only was the information true of Harvard College, but also true for undergraduates in each of the college’s divisions—Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Sciences—as well as the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. At Harvard, worries of grade inflation are nothing new.
As students wondered if the news would affect how their fall term courses would be graded, national outlets raced to criticize Harvard for the alleged grade inflation. But many Harvard professors defended their grading practices, telling The Crimson that they were not overly concerned about the potential consequences of higher grading averages and that elevated grades do not necessarily indicate that Harvard is getting easier.
University administrators, including Harris, have declined to release more detailed grade information, ensuring that the curiosity surrounding grading at Harvard will linger into 2014.
Budget battles in the nation’s capital hit home this spring when the sequester—a set of automatic, across-the-board cuts to government spending—slashed federal research budgets, resulting in reductions that could cost Harvard tens of millions of dollars in lost funding for scientists and other researchers across its schools. The University received more than $650 million from Washington during FY 2012.
Though the cuts, designed to help curb the nation’s budget deficit, were initially meant to take effect in January, legislative maneuvers and continuing debate in Congress postponed the final decision until the end of February. When the cuts finally took effect on March 1, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, two of the top sources of research funding at Harvard, were forced to confront 5 percent spending reductions, while the Department of Defense faced cuts of approximately 8 percent.
University researchers already beleaguered by years of stagnant funding—especially researchers in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Medical School, and other schools with a high reliance on federal support—worried that new funding pressures would hinder the progress of young, budding scientists and deter students from entering research-centered fields. While many researchers have turned to private sources of funding to supplant the loss in federal support, most say that these alternative funding channels are not perfect substitutes, especially for basic, rather than applied, research endeavors.
Both before and after the sequester took effect, University President Drew G. Faust lobbied in Congress on behalf of Harvard’s researchers, calling scientific research the “a foundation of our success as a nation for the past 60 years.” The president even dedicated much of her Commencement address to the subject. For now, researchers across campus are working to adjust to the altered funding landscape, which, if left unaddressed, will mean yearly reductions for the next decade.
Harvard’s endowment may be growing again, but debate over the University’s investment decisions attracted national attention this year when University President Drew G. Faust released a letter reaffirming Harvard’s stance against fossil fuel divestment and as concerned students continued to mobilize and rally against the University’s position.
In recent years, a vocal group of students, alumni, and other University affiliates has called for Harvard to divest its $32.7 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies, and in November 2012, a majority of voters expressed support for referenda that called for fossil fuel divestment and the creation of a social choice endowment fund. Throughout 2013, these individuals, many of whom belong to on-campus organizations like Responsible Investment at Harvard and Divest Harvard, hosted events, coordinated rallies, and voiced their concerns to University officials. In February, proponents of responsible investing expressed cautious optimism when the Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s endowment, created a new vice presidential position devoted to sustainable investing concerns.
Yet a letter penned by Faust and released by the University in October reaffirmed the University’s stance against divestment. In the letter, Faust argued that fossil fuel divestment would politicize the University’s endowment, bear little impact on the fossil fuel industry, and divert attention from Harvard’s other environmentally-oriented endeavors.
The president’s letter sparked immediate outrage on campus and across the nation from divestment advocates, including student groups, alumni like environmentalist Bill E. McKibben ’82, and even the mayor of Seattle. Many activists vow to continue to push for divestment in the coming years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was only one Harvard wrestler left standing at the end of Sunday night’s session of the 51st Annual Ken Kraft Midlands Championships at Northwestern University. When the competition finished Monday evening, no Crimson wrestler had taken a spot on the podium. Harvard's team of eight finished the tournament 29th out of 47 college teams, scoring 12 points overall.
The last Harvard wrestler left standing was sophomore Devon Gobbo in the 165 lb weight class. After dropping his opening match to Purdue’s Chad Welch at 4:23, Gobbo won face-offs against Minnesota’s Nick Wanzek and Rider’s Ramon Santiago, 13-3 and 9-6, respectively.
In the quarterfinal match against Wisconsin’s Frank Cousins, Gobbo came out strong despite aggravating a knee injury during the first frame of action. After Cousins cut Gobbo's initial 3-0 lead to one point, the Harvard sophomore responded with five straight and closed out the match, 8-3, to move on to Monday’s session.
On Monday, Gobbo could not keep his win streak alive and fell to Josh Houldsworth of Columbia, 4-3. With Gobbo’s loss, the Crimson was officially out of the tournament.
“Right now everybody’s hurt and banged out, but all I ask is that the guys come out and fight,” Weiss said. “[Gobbo] is very talented, and he could beat a lot of people here.”
Freshman Tyler Grimaldi wrestled at 157 lbs and found a first round victory over Northwestern’s Dylan Marriott, 6-2, before losing to Isaac Jordan of Wisconsin, 12-3. Franklin and Marshall's Andrew Murano eliminated Grimaldi in the consolation bracket, 8-6.
“This was not my best showing, but I know what I need to work on and where I need to be going into practice for the rest of the year,” Grimaldi said. “As a team we’re on the brink of getting to the next level, and we really trust in our coaching to get us there.”
The only other Harvard wrestler to win his first round match-up was sophomore Todd Preston, who beat Ryan Fillingame of Adams State, 6-5, at 141 lbs. Preston then dropped a contest to Iowa’s Josh Dziewa, 8-4, to fall into the consolation bracket.
Preston went on to beat Shyheim Brown of Maryland, 4-0, but was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the second session with a 10-7 overtime loss to Wisconsin’s Jesse Thielke. Tied at six going into the fourth extra frame of the match, Preston quickly found himself down 10-6 after the whistle. The Crimson sophomore was able to fend off Thielke’s pin and score a point, but could not convert again.
“This is such a tough tournament…at this level of competition,” coach Jay Weiss said. “I think [the Harvard wrestlers] are ready and the other coaches think they’re ready, but they aren’t wrestling to that level yet. We are going to use this tournament as a stepping stone into the next phase of the season to push the guys to be better.”
Senior co-captain Cameron Croy went up against Jimmy Sheptock of Maryland, who was ranked second in the 184 lb weight class, in the first round match and fell, 6-1. Croy was then able to beat Peinceton’s Scott Gibbons, 5-2, before dropping his final contest to Kurt Julson of North Dakota State, 4-2.
Freshman Eric Morris dropped his first match against Wisconsin’s Scott Liegel, 9-7, before recording a win over Jimmie Schuessler of Grand View, 11-2. Morris withdrew from his next match against Brown’s Ricky McDonald due to illness.
In the 133 lb weight class, sophomore Jeff Ott dropped consecutive matches to Michigan’s Rossi Bruno and Northwestern’s Dom Malone, 11-4 and 8-5, respectively.
After falling to Virginia Tech’s Nick Brascetta, 19-5, in the opening match, junior 157-pounder Paul Liguori was able to pick up a victory against Northwestern’s David Helmer, 4-2, before losing , 13-3, to Illinois’ Zac Brunson.
Heavyweight Nick Gajdzik lost at 4:07 to Michigan’s Adam Coon in his opening match on Sunday. In the consolation bracket, the Harvard sophomore beat Princeton’s Ray O’Donnell, 8-3, before ending his night with a loss to Ty Walz of Virginia Tech. Down 5-4 with ten seconds left on the clock, Gajdzik pushed Walz to the last second of the match but could not come up with a point.
“Going into this level of competition, there’s no way you can’t come out of here with more maturity because it kind of wakes you up,” Weiss said. “I think some guys, even in losses…can stay competitive with the best wrestlers out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y.--As 2013 comes to a close, both Fordham women's basketball and Temi Fagbenle get to keep their streaks alive. The Rams, who dismantled the Harvard women's basketball team on Monday at Rose Hill Gym, won their tenth straight game, 64-44, to tie the longest winning streak in their program's history. Crimson junior forward Fagbenle notched her fifth straight double-double and 14th in her career.
“I think Fordham’s a really good team and they’re very well coached,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. ‘They’ve got inside players and phenomenal shooters. I think they’re a veteran team and very smart. I think they were the better team tonight.”
In the final of Fordham's Holiday Classic, Fagbenle was the leading scorer for the Crimson (9-4), with 11 points, and also topped the rebounds column, grabbing 12 boards. Redshirt senior guard Erin Rooney powered the offense for Fordham (11-2) with a game-high 19 points.
While Rooney led the scoring effort, teammate Abigail Corning did the same on the glass and connecting with teammates. Corning matched Fagbenle’s 12 rebounds and doled out six assists – one more assist than the Crimson had as a team. The Rams outrebounded Harvard, 47-33, through the contest.
Back in her second game after a nearly month-long break, co-captain Christine Clark improved a point from Sunday’s game to notch 10 points. Junior forward Erin McDonnell matched Clark’s mark, her sixth-straight game scoring in double digits.
“I think it’s just getting back into the feel of things,” Clark said. “I’m obviously really happy to be back playing with everyone and happy to be healthy enough to play.”
After struggling to make shots fall during the second half of Sunday’s contest, the Crimson had difficulty hitting an offensive rhythm in the first half. Harvard shot at just 15 percent from the field and hit one of six attempts from behind the arc.
Success for the Crimson came in foul shooting, where Fagbenle, McDonnell and Clark proved reliable at the line and combined to knock down all eight of their free throw attempts. As much as Harvard was successful in drawing the foul, the visitors were also mostly successful in keeping the Rams from the line, allowing Fordham just one opportunity at the charity stripe through the first frame.
But the Crimson still found trouble under the net early, as Fordham out-rebounded Harvard, 24-13. The Rams capitalized on their possessions and took advantage of open lanes at the three-point line. Starting guards Rooney and Hannah Missry each took six looks from long as Fordham drilled seven of 18 tries from behind the perimeter.
Clark said that the Crimson will have to prevent similar defensive breakdowns in conference play.
“[The Rams] were a good shooting team, so you’ve got to give them credit in that regard, but we could have done a better job [defensively],” Clark said. “There are going to be Ivy League teams that have just as good shooters if not better, so it’s good to get this one out of the way.”
A two-point lead grew to double digits as Fordham went on a 16-4 run during the middle section of the first half, and the hosts headed into the locker room with a 16-point lead.
“I thought we had a run in the first period where it went from a game to a 10 point deficit,” Delaney-Smith said. ‘That was all on our mistakes which is, again, unfortunate that we work hard but we don’t work smart. That was too much of a not-smart session.”
While Harvard’s shooting improved to 34 percent during the second stanza, it was too little too late. A layup from senior guard Melissa Mullins and a three from McDonnell drew the Crimson within 13 points at two separate points throughout the half, but the Rams continued to pull away and extend their lead.
The contest is the last for the Crimson before it opens its Ivy League season on Jan. 11 at Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Basketball is not about the quantity of minutes played, but rather the quality of those minutes.
Reserve sophomore forward Agunwa Okolie only logged 15 minutes in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s win against Fordham on Saturday, but it was how he used those minutes that earned him Athlete of the Week honors.
Despite starting the game on the bench, the second-year player notched a career-high 17 points to go along with six rebounds at Rose Hill Gym in the Bronx to help lead the Crimson to its seventh straight win, 94-86.
“We knew that this was going to be a very hard game this quickly after the Christmas break,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “So I’m pleased with our guys and the effort they gave.”
Okolie’s dunk with less than two minutes remaining in the game put the exclamation point on the sophomore’s night. The 6’8” forward used his size to make his presence known on the inside, tallying eight points in the paint to help give the Crimson an eight-point victory.
“[Okolie] was tremendous,” Amaker said. “He’s long, rangy [and] athletic.”
The Rams were neck-and-neck with Harvard through the first ten minutes, swapping the lead five times in that span. With the score knotted at 23 with 9:08 remaining in the first half, Amaker sent in Okolie for his first appearance of the game. His impact was immediate. In just four minutes on the floor, Okolie knocked down a pair of free throws and a layup to help spur a 10-2 run to give the Crimson a lead it would not relinquish the rest of the game.
“I think that’s been one of the keys to our team, our bench, and our balance.” Amaker said. “Different guys have been able to step forward for us and give us quality minutes.”
As the Harvard lead dwindled to seven with just four minutes remaining in the contest, Okolie came back into the game and went out of his comfort zone to give the Crimson the cushion it needed to help pull off the victory. The lanky forward drained his first three-point attempt of the year to help extend Harvard’s lead back into the double digits.
Okolie had reentered the game early in the second half to help fend off a pesky Fordham team that would not go away easily. Exploiting the Crimson’s advantage on the inside, the forward ripped off six straight points for Harvard to help extend its lead to ten points before coming off with just under ten minutes remaining.
Okolie was nearly perfect on the day from the field, hitting six of his seven shots. On the one attempt he missed, he quickly grabbed the offensive board and finished at the rim.
“I think that even the game before this one you’re starting to see signs of growth and confidence,” Amaker said of Okolie. “Certainly today was just about as good as you can expect for the kind of production in 15 minutes of play.”
