After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard’s dining service workers will begin an indefinite strike next Wednesday if a “fair agreement” between the workers and the University is not reached by the night before, union representatives announced in a press release.
“Instead of serving breakfast, workers will walk picket lines at more than a dozen locations across Harvard’s undergraduate and graduate campuses,” the press release, sent Friday afternoon, reads. The press release did not indicate how long a strike would last should it go into effect next week, though it did characterize a potential strike, to begin Oct. 5, as “open-ended.”
In a statement after the announcement, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that “Over the past four months, Harvard has been committed to working with Local 26 in good faith to reach a new agreement that recognizes our colleagues’ important contributions while supporting the University’s core mission of research, teaching and learning.”
DeLuzuriaga added that Harvard’s bargaining team was “disappointed” that a settlement had not yet been reached.
“We have proposed creative solutions to issues presented by the union, and hoped union representatives would contribute to finding creative, workable solutions at the negotiation table,” deLuzuriaga wrote. “We are disappointed that thus far they have been unwilling to do so.”
Representatives from the University and UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining workers, met for their 17th bargaining session Friday morning, but did not come to an agreement.  A federal mediator was present at the session to facilitate the talks.
Over the course of the negotiations, HUDS representatives have demanded increased wages and a “creative” solution to health care benefits that would not require HUDS workers to pay anymore in out of pocket costs. Local 26 has demanded that the University extend year-round work to interested employees, and institute a $35,000 “minimum guaranteed salary” for those employees, according to union spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck.
Harvard’s dining workers currently make an average of $34,000 per year, according to DeLuzuriaga—a salary she has described as  “some of the most generous wages and benefits in the foodservice industry.
After the session, dining workers, joined by a crowd of nearly 400 Harvard affiliates, took to Harvard Yard to protest stagnancy in the negotiations. At the event, Anabela A. Pappas, a HUDS worker who works in Pforzheimer and Cabot Houses, said workers did not want to strike because of the adverse effects such a move might have on the student body.
Nicholus F. Heron, another worker who works in Quad dining halls, criticized Harvard for not paying its workers more, given the size of its endowment.
“Our job is to create a second home for students, it's ridiculous in a university with so much money that we have to worry about these things, about taking care of ourselves," Heron said.
Supporters of HUDS have pointed to the size of the University’s $35.7 billion endowment—the largest university endowment in the world—to argue for increased wages. But Harvard cannot simply pull money from the endowment to pay its dining workers, several analysts have pointed out, given that the endowment is comprised largely of restricted funds.
In the weeks since the union announced its intent to strike in early September, more than 2,700 students from across Harvard’s schools have signed a petition pledging support for the workers in the event that they strike. At the rally, that support was on full display as students raised picket signs adorned with the Local 26 insignia and chanted “El pueblo unido, jamás será vencido,” a Spanish union chant that translates to: “The people united will never be defeated”
HUDS has been in contract talks with the University since the summer time. Their contract, which was set to expire on June 19 was extended into September so that the two sides could come to an agreement. The contract, which included a no-strike clause, expired Sept. 17.
On Sept. 15, HUDS workers voted overwhelmingly in favor to authorize a strike should the University not comply with their demands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 4, 2016, at 10:44 a.m.
The threat of rain did not deter nearly 400 Harvard affiliates from marching in front of Massachusetts Hall Friday afternoon in support of Harvard’s dining workers, who announced earlier in the day that they intend to strike next Wednesday should the University not comply with their demands.
Chanting “No justice, no food,” HUDS workers and students circled Harvard Yard before arriving at the statue of John Harvard, where workers shared their stories and opinions about the negotiations.
Representatives from other campus unions also attended the rally. Bill Jaeger, who heads the largest union on Harvard’s campus, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said HUCTW intends to “fully support” the dining workers if they proceed with a strike.
Harvard and HUDS have been bargaining since June, when the union’s contract was initially set to expire. Fearing that negotiations would outlast the contract’s duration, both sides agreed to extend it until Sept. 17. But contract talks have persisted to the end of September. On Friday,  UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining workers—said the union would begin an “open-ended” strike next week if they did not reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Harvard.
Following the rally Friday evening, workers, union representatives, and students converged on Harvard Law School’s student lounge for a "speakout” event hosted by the Harvard National Lawyers Guild. Several HUDS workers shared with supporters their personal experiences of working at Harvard in a discussion moderated by Law student and Reclaim Harvard Law member Marco R. Castanos.
Reclaim Harvard Law, a group of student race and diversity activists who occupied that same lounge for much of the spring, was one of 15 Law School student groups that released a statement last week supporting HUDS and denouncing the contract stalemate. Since last spring, Reclaim sought to integrate staff into their movement, and on Friday cast the potential HUDS strike as a part of their “struggle” for racial justice.
“We recognize that the struggles of people from marginalized communities and people of color are universal, they’re not just confined to students. So it wouldn’t make sense for Reclaim and the strike not to stand in solidarity with one another,” Castanos said in an interview. “The struggles that they’re going for, to me at least, they’re synonymous.”
While panelists brought up common grievances related to healthcare and wages, racial justice emerged as a theme of Friday’s discussion, as workers recounted stories of alleged racial bias by dining services employers.
Students at Friday’s Law School “speakout” announced they plan to join HUDS workers on the picket lines, and Law student organizers urged their peers to boycott the school’s pub if workers strike Wednesday.
Edward B. Childs, a cook in Adams House, praised students from the Law School and Harvard Medical School for allying themselves with the union. Childs sharply rebuked University President Drew G. Faust’s comments earlier this week praising the worker’s health benefits, calling her “unprofessional.”
Childs specifically referenced an analysis conducted by a cohort of Medical School students of the health benefits proposal Harvard has extended to HUDS during this round of contract talks.
“The Medical School students are our experts,” Childs said.

The Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate group that has rallied for campus unions before, is calling on students to bring food from the dining hall to workers during the duration of the strike, if it occurs and if the dining halls are still open, according to SLAM member Kevin E. O’Donnell ’17.
“Obviously we can’t ask people not to eat in the dining halls,” O’Donnell said at the rally in the Yard. “What we’re asking people to do is, when you get food in the dining hall, bring it out to the picket lines and eat with the workers.
Additionally, SLAM is organizing what they describe as a “dine-in,” during which students would bring their trays from their dining halls and eat dinner in front of Mass. Hall.

CORRECTION: Oct 4., 2016
A previous version of this article implied unionized HUDS employees staff Harvard Law School's pub. In fact, students work at the bar itself, and private contractor Restaurant Associates manages the food.
