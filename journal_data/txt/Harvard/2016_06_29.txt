After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before this summer, I’d never had a four-digit balance in my bank account. I’d managed to earn a couple hundred dollars that I burnt on books and dorm supplies during the first few weeks of fall semester, but that’s as close as I’d gotten. The rest of the year, I got by scrubbing toilets in the couple of hours I could find scattered beneath papers and in the cobble-stoned cracks between club meetings.
I started my trip to Manila with a full bank account thanks to an internship grant I got through the Harvard Office of Career Services. There’s been an unusual freedom in being able to grab a takeout meal or Uber around Manila—two luxuries I avoid during the school year. Here, I can enjoy them without a second thought because I know the money’s there for me.
I’ve grown as a person, traveled to Asia for the first time, and learned about an entirely foreign culture—all at the sticker price of $5,000 dollars. My mind can’t help but wonder the opportunities and life experiences that come with $10,000, or $15,000, or more. It makes me realize that making money, as much as I hate to admit it, is very important to me. This realization does not come from my summer experience alone.
Harvard is—to put it simply—rich. The campus sits on multimillion dollar real estate. The administrative offices are adorned with glowing mahogany furniture. The recent house renovations have made our living spaces look like high-end hotels. The celebrity and guest speakers that have been the gems of my time here come with a hefty price tag. Even so, I like this new, alien world I’ve found myself in. The Harvard brand and the success of this school’s alumni were major selling points. What I didn’t initially realize was that the pursuit of money means very different things to very different Harvard students.
There are students who’ve grown up in these spaces and understand what it means to interact with this kind of currency. Whether it was because of a prep school or a parent, they at least understand what their place amongst the affluence is, even if it isn’t a position of complete possession. But there are many students who don’t even know where to start navigating a new environment so saturated with cues of the wealthy elite.
These are disproportionately first-generation students of color, whose parents did not attend college. In the Class of 2019, 45 percent of first-generation students come from households with a yearly income less than $40,000, and 94 percent receive financial aid. With the proven ties between educational attainment and income, it’s no surprise that first-generation students are not accustomed to the kind of affluence that Harvard demands and exudes.
Demographically, I’m one of the most ill-equipped to navigate this money-soaked landscape. In the United States, Latino families are impoverished at higher rates than their white counterparts, and immigrant families have been experiencing economic downfall at faster rates. Out of any racial group in the Class of 2019, Latino students are the most likely to be first-generation college students. My simple cream-colored home, filled with the chatter of rushed Spanish during routine phone calls to relatives in El Salvador, is a stark contrast to the expensive white marble I walk on in Cambridge.
For first-generation Latino students, college is a place where we’re suspended between two worlds, and this builds a set of hardships based on both economic and racial marginalization. While we’re in this zone of uncertainty, Harvard supports us financially through their ever expanding financial aid program, but throwing money at a problem is not enough. Being at Harvard, especially for first-generation students, is a key step in leaving a world we love and respect in the name of socioeconomic mobility. To possess money is not synonymous with understanding the culture of wealth.
Full, comprehensive support from the administration would address the social cues and codes of this new culture. The lack of a pre-orientation program for first-generation students is a gap in the current support system. More uniformly available first-generation tutors, tailored mental health services, and mainstreamed personal finance services would strengthen the institutional support these students receive. The problem is as much about not knowing the difference between semiformal and black tie as it is about not having enough money to attend the events that require these attires.
While we may not all reach the kind of financial success of the people who name the buildings of this school, odds are we are going to be richer than we’ve ever been because we graduated from Harvard. If the American Dream is alive anywhere, it is in the story of a child of immigrant parents who made it into the gates of Harvard University. The catch is that socioeconomic mobility is not simply increased comfort. It’s also psychological and even physical stress that Harvard offers on a silver platter. When I take a bite, I just hope I’ve been provided everything I need to stomach it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard administrators rejoiced after the Supreme Court upheld race-conscious admissions policies at the University of Texas, it is unclear whether the decision will similarly apply to Harvard as it fights to protect its admissions policies in court.
A lawsuit against Harvard, brought forth in 2014 by Students for Fair Admissions—an anti-affirmative action group—alleges that the University’s admission process discriminates against Asian American applicants to maintain implicit racial “quotas.”
Thus far, the process has progressed slowly. Last year, Harvard asked to put the lawsuit on hold pending the Supreme Court ruling on a similar case, Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin. In the case, a white woman who was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin sued the university, alleging the school discriminated against her based on her race.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld the school’s affirmative action policies, but the ruling limits the potential for sweeping precedents in affirmative action litigation and may not necessarily provide definitive guidance for Harvard. 
Writing that the University of Texas’s admissions program is to be considered “sui generis,” or “of its own kind,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy noted in the majority opinion that Texas’s system represents an anomaly among race-conscious admissions programs because, at the time, it granted automatic admission to the top 10 percent of graduating high school students in Texas (applicants for the class entering in fall 2017 must be in the top seven percent). Today, under the plan, the university must make a “good faith” effort to fill up to 75 percent of seats the university’s freshman class, while others are filled by students selected using a holistic admissions criteria common among American universities—and one that factors in race.
“The fact that this case has been litigated on a somewhat artificial basis, furthermore, may limit its value for prospective guidance,” Kennedy wrote.
Both parties in the Harvard case, meanwhile, did await guidance from Fisher’s outcome. In April, both parties agreed to draft letters once Fisher’s decision was released, detailing the ways they believed the Supreme Court decision would affect the ongoing litigation. They are expected to meet again sometime in late July.
In the opinion, Kennedy, referencing University of Texas, wrote that they have an “ongoing obligation to engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection” with regard to their admissions policies. To make their race-sensitive admissions policies defensible in court, schools must prove that affirmative action is critical to their “compelling interests.” In the case of the University of Texas, those compelling interests involved fostering diversity on campus—a goal that Harvard too has undertaken with its  outreach efforts to minority students.

Whether this is your last summer as a Harvard student or only your first, at some point during these sunny months it may cross your mind how fortunate you are to be among the select few attending this renowned institution. Yes, Harvard College does have a dauntingly low acceptance rate of 5.2 percent, but before you give yourself too much credit, take a look at seven things with even lower acceptance rates: 
A job as an NBC Page: 4.6% acceptance rate
With responsibilities ranging from working in various departments to giving tours of the studio, the page program at the National Broadcasting Company has an acceptance rate of just 4.6 percent, according a 2016 Business Insider report. I mean, it’s not as cool as working at the Crimson, but we can’t all get lucky.
An analyst position at Goldman Sachs: 3% acceptance rate
Next time that annoying kid in your Econ section starts talking about how she’s a shoo-in for Goldman, whip out this statistic: the multinational banking firm reported hiring just 3 percent of applicants in 2015, including summer interns.
A job at Walmart in Washington D.C.: 2.6% acceptance rate
When Walmart first opened in Washington D.C. in 2013, the company reported that its employee acceptance rate was 2.6 percent. In other words, Walmart is twice as selective as Harvard College. Mull that over next time you’re wandering the aisles of this big box retailer.
A job as a flight attendant for Delta Airlines: 1.4% acceptance rate
It is almost four times harder to become a flight attendant for Delta Airlines than it is to be accepted by Harvard College, the company announced in 2012. At cruising altitude of 39,000 feet, their career is literally higher than yours will ever be.
Admission to McDonald’s Hamburger University in Shanghai: 1% acceptance rate 
The Shanghai branch of McDonald’s Hamburger University—a global training center developed by the fast food company—is much harder to get into than Harvard College, with an acceptance rate of only 1 percent as of 2011, according to Bloomberg News. So while you may think that your CS50 pset is a struggle, just think about the complex equations that go into making the perfect krabby patty—er, Big Mac.
A job as a Secret Service agent: Less than 1% acceptance rate 
The acceptance rate for becoming a Secret Service agent was somewhere below 1 percent in 2011, Bloomberg News reported. But you know what? We can’t even complain. We think everyone’s okay with the fact that the agency protecting our president—and our soon-to-be classmate Malia—is a little more selective than Harvard College, right?
A job at Google: 0.2% acceptance rate
