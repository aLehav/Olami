After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When news broke that a debate team made up of prison inmates had defeated the Harvard College Debating Union in competition, the story drew international news coverage and swept social media. “Someone should make a movie about this,” tweeted US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, echoing widespread praise for the debaters from a maximum-security New York State prison. The Harvard College Debating Union, which was crowned world champions in 2014, expressed their admiration for the group of prisoners over Facebook: “There are few teams we are prouder of having lost a debate to than the phenomenally intelligent and articulate team we faced this weekend.”
But in reality, the victory should not have come as much of a surprise at all. Last month’s win against Harvard marked a growing list of accomplishments for the roughly 20-member team from the Eastern New York Correctional Facility. Inmates on the team take part in the Bard Prison Initiative, which offers an undergraduate education to about 300 New York State prisoners through Bard College.
In 2014, the prison’s debate team knocked off a nationally ranked squad from the University of Vermont. They also won their first competition against the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, with whom they now have an annual rivalry. That the inmates are not allowed to use the Internet for research—instead having to make book and article requests to the prison administration that can take weeks at a time—makes their success all the more impressive.
More significant, however, is the statement the team’s victory makes about America’s criminal justice system. With over 1.5 million individuals behind bars as of 2014, the US has the world’s highest incarceration rate. This phenomenon has generated negative stereotypes about prisoners, who often have difficulty reintegrating into society after serving their sentences.
The Bard Prison Initiative is a strong sign that our thinking about prisoners and their abilities needs drastic reorientation. Of the over 300 alumni that have earned degrees through the Bard Prison Initiative, less than 2 percent have returned to prison within three years (the standard time frame for measuring recidivism), compared to a New York state average of over forty percent. The program does not charge tuition and is funded entirely by private donors. Graduates of the program have continued their studies at schools like NYU and Yale.
This success points to the need for more programs like Bard’s that work with those incarcerated to provide them with the tools to reintegrate back into society. The uptick in donations to the Bard Prison Initiative is an encouraging signal that the program will be able to start expanding beyond its current New York state bridgehead.
As Harvard’s team stated in their Facebook message, credit and praise are surely due to the prisoners from Bard. But the very fact that we find this narrative inspiring is a sign of the many stereotypes we hold about people behind bars. The Bard program shows that what most prisoners lack is opportunity, not intelligence or work ethic. We hope that national replication of the Bard program continues so that all inmates can have the same opportunities afforded to those who defeated Harvard and caused a national sensation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s almost nothing more annoying than “that kid on your newsfeed.”
You know who I’m talking about: that dude who promotes the cause of the day on social media, signs online petitions, and embraces the title of Social Justice Warrior, even though the closest thing to a war he’s ever engaged in constitutes the exchange of few nasty Facebook comments.
On the surface, this Kony 2012-inspired, #SMH-writing, tilde-abusing Internet expert appears to be as impotent as the 65-year-old protagonist of a Cialis ad. But behind what ostensibly seems like attention grabbing is a sobering truth: these posts are a necessary component of the cultural consciousness.
Some of these kids are absolutely intolerable. So, please, as I make the following defense of That Kid On Your Newsfeed, do not picture the Self-Righteous Privileged Kid On Your Newsfeed—the white, straight, cis private school student body president who laments on Facebook that the criminal justice system is giving him an anxiety attack (who, me?). He remains incomprehensibly aggravating.
But for every irritating, ignorant, or even offensive newsfeed kid I’ve seen, there’s been someone out there contributing positively to the public discourse, someone who might not have been able to do so without the Internet.
And when you look at the most important social movements of the past several years, from the Arab Spring to #BlackLivesMatter, the Internet has been a critical battleground for organization, messaging, and collective action.
As the most prolific Facebook poster from my graduating class in high school, Lanny Anais, explained to me over Facebook message: “Facebook posts seem inconsequential, until [they] get shared a hundred thousand times and then end up [on] twitter and then end up on tumblr and before you know it, a million people have gotten a message.”
But Internet activists like Anais don’t strictly use Facebook to get their own points across—they use it to report the news. “Regarding advocacy against systems of oppression, like white supremacy and the patriarchy,” Lanny explained, “news outlets and mass media let a lot of things get swept under the rug.”
Given that I’ve worshipped the news ever since watching All The President’s Men at eight years old, this is a hard reality for me to swallow. But no matter how many hours of Rachel Maddow I watch, I can't help but sympathize with the newsfeed kid on this one.
“When a black person dies, it's either not reported on at all, or the person's name is dragged through the mud on the news so as to cover up the racism and injustice behind the death,” Lanny continued. “We saw it with Michael Brown, we saw it with Freddie Gray and Eric Garner, we even saw it with 12-year-old Tamir Rice.”
“THAT’S why we have people… on the ground live tweeting during protests—sending us videos and first hand accounts, because otherwise, we get a victim-blaming version of the truth.”
On the one hand, Lanny is exactly right: Social media can give us a direct lens into live injustices without the filter of the mainstream media. But, as she admits, this is because some new-age activists actually go into the field and report, as opposed to That Kid On Your Newsfeed who writes statuses from the comfort of his bed.
That said, my previous hatred of Internet activism was misguided because I paid more attention to the lack of concrete change these movements created than the people they reached. After all, if you view newsfeed kids as modern day Woodward and Bernsteins—striving to expose, rather than simply fight injustices—their from-a-bed activism makes much more sense.
Instead of resenting movements like #BringBackOurGirls for their failure to provide results, we should appreciate them for bringing attention to the atrocities being committed in places like Nigeria. Rather than stew in frustration over the continued lack of concrete legislative changes made in response to #BlackLivesMatter, we should acknowledge that had it not been for the digital elements of this movement, millions of people might not know about Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, or Tamir Rice.
So, even if I don’t fully understand the machinations behind Internet activism, I can appreciate it, because like a 65-year-old who has just taken Cialis, when the time for action is right, That Kid On Your Newsfeed will be ready.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My biggest claim to fame is the vegetarian blog I created and ran in middle and high school. At its peak it had about 15,000 followers, and I was spending many of my wild, teenage late nights online, fielding a mailbox full of questions from meat eaters and non-meat eaters alike.
This was my first acquaintance with activism gone wrong. I didn’t have the language for it at the time, but it only took so many death threats from angry vegans before I started to draw conclusions about what it means to be an advocate, how to cope with politics and the self, how to be the best activist.
Mostly, I got a lot of concerning health-related questions about which the askers really should have sought help from a medical professional. Besides those, the questions (there are 421 unanswered in the mailbox right now) broke down in a predictable way: easy thing the asker could have googled, argument over semantics, hostile vegan, angry meat-eater.
It was perplexing to me, even then, why a meat-eater would Internet-scream at a vegetarian for making them feel sad and guilty, how a vegan would Internet-scream at a vegetarian for being a hypocrite. It felt silly and pointless to argue with random strangers, probably also children, about what the word vegetarian really meant, discussing identity politics regarding a dietary choice. I set out to complain anonymously about how McDonald’s literally sold zero solid food items that were vegetarian, and I ended up some kind of end-all be-all voice on vegetarianism. I was 14 and sitting in my bed on tumblr. I just wanted everyone to get along.
Of course, I do remember the rush of it. Typing furiously on my laptop, opening tab after tab, knowing I was totally going to crush a gross omnivore or harsh vegan with my politics, my wit. Shaking, grinning, clicking send. At first, it was intoxicating.
After a while it was exhausting. I couldn’t bring myself to check my inbox. I didn’t think about being a vegetarian nearly as much as I talked about it online. I knew what I believed, I knew what I was about, but still there was this relentless heat from all sides. I was jaded, fatigued. My laptop was an anxious place.
I’m still a vegetarian, usually. When I look back now, there are, of course, conclusions I can draw about who I was then. I was shrinking myself to fit into a “movement,” or whatever, that was pretty alienating for me. I saw enough people comparing factory farming to slavery to want to quit the Internet forever. I witnessed so many fired up white people profoundly misunderstanding race and class it took me back to my Jesus camp days, (and perhaps the day for that column will come.) Ideologically, I was at a different place then than I am now. I still love animals; I still care about the environment. I don’t eat meat. It’s not really my beat anymore, the militant vegetarian thing, but I did learn some things, at least, from when it was. Like that no one person can speak for any individual group. Back then I was a vegetarian who didn’t think vegetarians should eat gelatin, but now I’m a vegetarian who really doesn’t give a shit about that. Back then I had not yet heard the word intersectional, but now I get that you can’t argue for vegetarianism or veganism without understanding and talking about poverty, class, and culture.
If you expect the one vegetarian who runs the blog to answer for all vegetarians, you’re being silly (and when it’s with things that matter more than vegetarianism, you’re being prejudiced.) If you expect your kind of vegetarianism to be perfectly represented by one individual’s, you’re bound to end up feeling a little attacked, a little left out. But if your kind of vegetarianism genuinely, validly hurts people and their identities, you’re not doing it right either. If you are open to figuring out, though, how another individual’s identity and history must inform their personal identity as a vegetarian, you’re more likely to hear what they’re really saying, to maybe even grow yourself.
The lessons just keep coming. Whose voices were taking up the most space on all the vegetarian forums? What, at the end of the day, were we actually doing for this cause we all cared about? What are the benefits of turning inward as a community? When is it most effective to turn outward?
What does it mean for a meat eater to enter a space for non-meat eaters and yell about meat? I always just wanted to pop through the asker’s smudged laptop screen, shout, “Listen to yourself. What is it about this that is making you so upset? What’s at stake for you in my choices? Is this maybe guilt that you’re feeling? Why do you want so badly for me to unsubscribe from my ideas and subscribe to yours? So you don’t have to think anymore? Why does the thinking about this hurt you?”
Maybe it’s a stretch, maybe my vegetarian blog isn’t a microcosm for all of social justice, that’s fair. But I can at least speak to the aftertaste, that bitter exhaustion I felt at sixteen and feel sometimes now. When the self is so political, it takes real emotional acrobatics to get through a particularly heated discussion in class. To listen to a person who is literally the void of all the identities that make this body a survival say offensive shit on the internet, or in section, or straight up to my face for the sake of “engaging,” “discussing,” “playing the devil’s advocate.” To listen to a person who maybe checks some of the same boxes as me, but definitely doesn’t check all of them complain about feeling left out by my kind of activism. By my angry. By my feelings. To be expected to comfort that. Being a student, and an activist, and a functioning human being takes breaking off parts of yourself and putting a piece in the middle of the long wooden table in the dining hall, a piece on twitter, a piece in The Crimson, in Renegade, wherever. In no world is this a hobby, in no world is this easy work.
I sometimes think about the people for whom no cause is more personal than vegetarianism was for me as a kid. That’s fine, really, but it can be important to remember. There is something to be said for those of us who are working toward our own inevitable fatigue. There is something to be said of meat, of action, of kindness. And honestly, really, bless 14-year-old me for doing that shit when I didn’t even have to. Bless all of us, now, who do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard Medical School officially rolled out an overhaul of its curriculum this semester, students were met with a new system that they characterized by a heavy workload and an increased level of student engagement with content and faculty.
The curricular shift, which places less emphasis on lectures and more on pre-class learning, follows a one-year transitory period that prepared the Medical School for the rollout among the incoming first-year class this fall. 
Still, faculty said the new curriculum continues to undergo review and refinement. Medical School professor Richard M. Schwartzstein, who chaired the task force on the curriculum redesign, said the school’s administration will continue to develop the curriculum throughout the year along with student representatives.
Medical School first-years, the first group officially under the new system, said their first taste of the curriculum came in a large dose.
Gabriel E. Molina ’15 said his workload hovered around 12 hours each night during his orientation week. “The amount of prep material was really unreasonable,” he said.
Classmate Rebecca M. Hammond said she and other students initially viewed the curriculum negatively, adding that “the professors underestimated the amount of time it would take us to get through the material.”
For his part, Schwartzstein said faculty are working to ensure that assignments are the appropriate length.
But the large amount of out-of-the-classroom preparation also serves students well, said Tara Jain ’15, a Medical School first-year.
“Since we have the basics down before we come to class, we can apply the material to problem-solve and learn so much more from our professors and peers,” she said.
First-year Daniel A. Curiel, whose experience with the new curriculum is his first with the flipped classroom model, said he generally enjoys it as well.
“It really helps to learn the material beforehand and...go in and work through problems that stimulate my memory from the night before,” Curiel said. “Then I can actually apply it to an actual patient case.”
To balance the benefits of the new curriculum with its rigorous workload, Schwartzstein’s committee is continuing to supervise the implementation of the curriculum, and upperclassmen are monitoring assignments to gauge their appropriateness.
“Our class is the transition class. Technically, we are still in the old curriculum, but a lot of the faculty have been implementing some of the new pedagogical approaches,” said Jordan D. Anderson, a second-year at the Medical School who works with faculty to review the curriculum.
“[The curriculum is] not something you just put in place and leave there,” Schwartzstein said. “We make assessments. We revise and make it better the next year. We’re all hoping to make things better and ... we don’t expect perfection the first time around.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lowell House is hosting a series of discussions for students about sexual assault prevention throughout the rest of the month in response to the results of Harvard’s recent sexual assault climate survey.
While administrators have already hosted several town hall discussions since the results of the climate survey came out late last month, the Lowell House-specific meetings come with the expectation that all residents will attend, with meeting groups divided up by entryways. 
In an email to Lowell undergraduates, House administrators pointed to data from the climate survey that showed few undergraduates knew about the University’s sexual assault policy and how it handles complaints. The survey results also indicated that many undergraduates did not know about the College’s peer counseling resources.
“One of the main things that I heard from students in the meetings after the AAU’s release was that they felt that [freshmen] get a whirlwind orientation to sexual assault and relationship health issues but then no one mentions it again for their four years,” Lowell House Dean Caitlin M. Casey wrote in an email. “That isn’t good enough.”
Peer counselors with the group Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators, or CARE, will lead the meetings, which a House-wide email—co-signed by Casey and House Masters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin—described as “conversations.”
“No lectures, just a real discussion about how to create a campus that feels safe,” Lowell House administrators wrote in the email.
CARE falls under the purview of Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. According to Lindsey Baker, a spokesperson for Harvard University Health Services, professionals with OSAPR “assist with the content development and facilitation of all workshops to ensure consistency throughout.”  She referred further questions to Lowell administrators.
House administrators strongly encouraged undergraduates to attend the discussions in the coming weeks, writing in their email to students, “if you can give 12 hours a week to a cappella and 40 to Netflix, you can give 50 minutes to having a conversation about preventing sexual assault in our home.” They also scheduled a Saturday make-up session for students who cannot attend their assigned entryway meeting.
Students across the College have asked for continued sexual assault education, said Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College’s assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion. College administrators are considering ways to bolster Title IX training, dela Peña said earlier this month.
“There’s a commitment from the College: Let’s put some teeth into this, let’s put some skin in the game,” she said.
Casey, for her part, wrote that Lowell is open to doing something similar next year if it works well and making changes if it does not.
Undergraduates are also organizing wider town hall discussions throughout October geared toward specific undergraduate identities, including gender and sexual orientation focused discussions.

Historians discussed the impact of technology on historical archives at a panel Tuesday afternoon to celebrate the digitization of five collections in the Blackwell Family archives, a recent endeavor by the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute.
The almost 190,000 pages of material spanning from 1784 to 1981 reveal the activities of a family of notable leaders in several social movements during the 19th and 20th centuries, such as abolition, prohibition, and women’s suffrage.
The four experts on the panel expressed their admiration for the online archival material in terms of facilitating access and use, but said that the digital transition requires greater effort to place documents in context.
“We don’t escape by moving to digital. If there’s any thought that this is going to hasten the process of research, I think that’s a little foolhardy, honestly,” said panelist John F. Bell, an American Studies Ph.D. candidate in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. “I think if we’re going to do research in a meaningful way...we still need to recognize the importance of careful reading, of spending time with sources, of having a knowledge of context.”
For her part, panelist Melanie S. Gustafson, an associate professor in the History department at the University of Vermont, said that archive digitization did have some drawbacks in minimizing the experience of visiting an archive and meeting fellow researchers.
“Archives are where you meet people dead and alive. It’s also where you make those discoveries,” Gustafson said. “I’m not saying you can’t make discoveries at the computer, because you can, but that sense of ‘Oh my god, look at that cross hatched letter’...there’s something about that happening in the archives.”
Pablo Morales Henry, an archivist and programmer at the Schlesinger Library, walked attendees through the features of the site, showcasing different online filters and search tools to aid in research. Features included a ‘Finding Aid’ to navigate through documents, tools to increase readability of old papers, and a folder system that allows the user to personalize how his or her information is stored.
The event culminated in a group discussion in which audience members suggested ideas for furthering the impact of digital archives, such as expanding it to high schoolers and linking archives from various universities together to form a large database.
Attendee Suvi E. Karila, a visiting fellow from Finland in the History department, said she felt a personal positive connection to archive digitization.

Two Harvard faculty members received MacArthur Fellowships—commonly referred to as “Genius Grants”—at the end of September, giving them $625,000 each in unrestricted funds for future research.
The two winners were recognized for showing promise in their respective fields. Associate sociology and social studies professor Matthew S. Desmond studies eviction and poverty, and assistant Medical School professor Beth Stevens researches brain cell functions. 
Desmond wants to use the grant money to expand his research on the problem of affordable housing in the U.S. to a global scale.
The housing crisis is “an incredibly acute problem, but not ours [in the U.S.] alone,” Desmond said. “Trying to understand what this means on a global level and why cities are responding to the crisis in really different ways is something that I’m interested in doing. I think the grant will be enormously helpful in furthering that project.”
Bruce Western, a professor of sociology and one of Desmond’s colleagues, said that the MacArthur Foundation made a good decision by selecting Desmond as one of the award winners.
“Matt is just a remarkable and original scholar of American poverty,” Western said. “It’s infused with great moral purpose, so there’s this very rich humanity that he’s able to penetrate and represent.”
In his earlier research, Desmond lived in a trailer park and low-income housing in order to study how eviction and poverty affect each other.
“We’re in a situation in the U.S. where half of the renters below the poverty line are dedicating at least half of their incomes to their housing, and about one out of four are dedicating at least 70 percent of their income to housing,” Desmond said.
Across the Charles River, Stevens said she is unsure about exactly how she will spend the money, but added that it opens new opportunities for her and her lab into answering the key neurological questions that have defined her research.
“I think one thing this award will certainly do is enable us to delve into these questions, but in many ways we’re going to go after more high risk questions that the lab is interested in,” Stevens said.
These “high risk” questions include problems that might not be feasible, or might take years to get going under normal circumstance.
Stevens’s previous research showed that one type of brain cell called microglia helps regulate the connections in the brain. In a healthy brain, when there is an excess of synapses—which form the connections between nerve cells—in one area, the microglia help reduce the total number. When this microglial pruning process doesn’t occur normally, diseases such as autism or Alzheimer’s may be the result.

UPDATED: October 14, 2015, at 2:34 a.m. 
Secretary of State John F. Kerry spoke on a vast array of foreign policy issues at a discussion sponsored by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs on Tuesday night.
In a packed ballroom at the Charles Hotel hosting hundreds of attendees, the event was moderated by Harvard Kennedy School professor Graham T. Allison, director of the Belfer Center. 
The wide-ranging discussion featured Kerry reflecting on topics like the recent nuclear deal with Iran and prospects for environmental cooperation with China. Throughout the event, however, Kerry emphasized that the U.S. increasingly finds itself in a complex and interconnected world to which it has to react.
“I can’t think of a time where the United States of America has been leading in as many places simultaneously, engaged in as many life and death challenges around the world,” Kerry said.
Speaking about U.S. involvement in the Middle East, Kerry said that he refuses to give up on finding a solution to the conflict and strongly condemned the notion that Americans can be isolated from or unconcerned about the developments in the area. He specifically pointed to the conflict in Syria and the activity of radical militant group ISIS as having broad-reaching effects. 
“For all of you who sit in the United States and say, ‘Well I don’t need to worry about that, it doesn’t affect me,’ you’re wrong,” Kerry said. “Because if it does explode, we will inherit that. We may need to send young Americans, men and women, to the region as a consequence for not having done things to solve it otherwise.”
Speaking on the recent spate of violence in the Israeli-Palestinian area, Kerry expressed concern that the ultimate American goal of achieving a two-state solution is facing more challenges.
“What’s happening is that, unless we get going, a two-state solution will conceivably be out of the question. There’s been a massive increase in settlements over the course of the past years, and now you have this violence, and there’s this frustration that’s going,” Kerry said. “What always perplexes me is that we’ve been through countless negotiations, and most people have a very good sense of what has to be done, but it’s a question of having the courage and making the judgments to go there.”
Overall, Kerry said the biggest, long-term challenge for the U.S. is religious extremism and its influence on young people particularly in countries with fragile and corrupt governance, such as several countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
“The problem of religious, radical extremism is the challenge of our generation, and we’re going to need to do a lot more to help countries help themselves,” Kerry said. “If we don’t do a better job of taking our values and our interests and marrying them and engaging with the rest of the world to give greater capacity to international multilateral efforts, it’s going to come back to haunt people."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard publicly launched its capital campaign in 2013, it set out for the record books. The first fundraising drive to take place at every school across the University simultaneously, it aimed to raise $6.5 billion, more money than any previous effort not only at Harvard, but in the history of higher education.
To match the big figures were big goals. Some money will fund major capital projects, such as a new campus for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and an overhaul of Harvard’s undergraduate House system.
And with more than $6 billion raised barely two years into the campaign’s public phase, Harvard is showing no signs of slowing its fundraising ambitions.
Except at Harvard Law School. Fundraisers there are preparing to launch the public phase of its segment of the University’s larger fundraising drive on Oct. 23, making it the last of Harvard’s schools to do so.
For Steven Oliveira, the Law School’s dean for development and alumni relations tasked with coordinating the effort, this fundraising drive is “awkward.” The school just finished a $476 million capital campaign in 2008, funding major construction, and administrators there are wary of over-soliciting their donors.
But with the University’s larger campaign in full swing, Oliveira and his colleagues feel compelled to launch their own earlier than they had planned, but not without adjusting their fundraising strategies. Instead of trying to break a record, they have set a smaller goal and will focus on funding existing priorities, rather than creating new ones, in less time.
“We would not be in a campaign right now if it wasn’t for the University’s desire to have the ‘One Harvard’ campaign, which of course we want to be a part of, but again creates an awkwardness,” Oliveira said.
‘AWKWARD’ TIMING
For Harvard Law School, 2015 is an odd year to start a capital campaign. Beyond its close proximity to the end of its last fundraising drive, it follows the financial crisis and is only two years ahead of the school’s bicentennial in 2017, a major opportunity to solicit donations from involved alumni.
While Law School Dean Martha L. Minow described her and her colleagues as “excited” to participate in their first University-wide campaign, administrators acknowledge that doing so required some adjustments. University President Drew G. Faust emphasized the importance of total participation.
“We really thought it was important to have a University-wide campaign and to all be a part of the messaging of what Harvard is and how this supports all of Harvard, so there never was a moment when the Law School said, ‘We’re not going to be part of it,’” Faust said. “But there was always the sense that we had to be sensitive to the fact they had completed a campaign so recently.”
Given that timing, according to Oliveira, Law School officials decided to postpone the public launch of its upcoming campaign—two years after the centralized kickoff—for fear of otherwise overburdening benefactors. The campaign that concluded in 2008 exceeded its goal of $400 million, addressed many of the school’s needs—such as the construction of a new student and academic center—and drew from many of its most eligible donors.
To start another fundraising drive so soon, Oliveira said, risks double-dipping and asking too much of some alumni. In many cases, according to Oliveira, donors pledge gifts that they then pay off over several years. By the time Harvard began to prepare for its University-wide launch, many Law School donors were still making gifts toward the school’s last campaign.
Law School officials had also wanted to time their next campaign around the upcoming celebration of the Law School’s 200th year, Oliveira said. They are still calling the effort “The Harvard Law School Campaign for the Third Century.”
“It was an unusual bit of timing, because the Law School had just finished its campaign and therefore understandably did not want to go back to donors and say, ‘Gee, we just finished a campaign, thank you very much for your generosity, and we’re ringing your doorbell again,’” added Morgan Chu, a former president of Harvard’s Board of Overseers and a Law School campaign co-chair.
As other individual school campaigns launched throughout 2013 and 2014, then, the Law School waited. It also set a smaller goal than it raised before. According to Oliveira, Faust, and several donors, the Law School has set a campaign goal of less than $400 million—the sum the school sought to raise in its last fundraising drive.
“What we couldn’t do is essentially mortgage our future by trying to have an overly aggressive campaign when we weren’t in line to achieve that in this moment in time,” Oliveira said.
‘A REVERSE STRATEGY’
Most capital campaigns begin with a “quiet phase,” when fundraisers solicit donations at a slower pace a couple years before the official launch. According to Oliveira, schools usually use this time to engage some of their highest-profile donors in the hopes of soliciting large gifts, and later cast a wider net from the broader alumni base.
The Law School’s 2015 campaign is operating on a different schedule. Oliveira said he and his colleagues started with the broader base a couple years ago, when their quiet phase began, and will reach out to larger donors in the campaign’s latter stages.
“It’s just completely reversing the way you would do a traditional campaign so that we could be part of the University campaign,” Oliveira said.
Chu, an intellectual property lawyer who graduated from the Law School in 1976, said the school’s best option is to avoid returning to high-value donors too quickly given the circumstances. “The timing on how to approach various donors certainly makes a lot of sense to me,” he said.
Oliveira attributed the difference between the Law School’s fundraising strategy and the broader University’s approach to the timing of their respective campaigns. Harvard’s last central capital campaign wrapped up in 1999, a gap that Oliveira ascribed in part to the unexpected departure of former University President Lawrence H. Summers.
“In a lot of ways, they all had pent up demand, and we had expended demand, so for us, we’ve had to do this campaign differently,” Oliveira said.
‘CORE PRIORITIES’
Within this adjusted framework, Harvard Law School fundraisers are focusing their efforts on furthering pre-existing and tangible goals—what Oliveria called “core priorities”—instead of a major reinvention of the school. At the top of that list of priorities, according to Oliveira, is more funding for financial aid, an initiative many Law School alumni said they are eager to support.
For alumnus Jerome E. Hyman, who is also a member of the dean’s advisory board, it is important for the Law School to have a student body that is “not just composed of rich people.” Other donors share the sentiment.
“As the law school’s buildings have so substantially been recently upgraded, I think the emphasis should be on aid to support students, especially those going into public interest careers, and programs at the school that encourage that focus,” Mike Klein, chairman of the Sunlight Foundation and a Law School alumnus and member of the dean’s advisory board, wrote in an email.
In addition to financial aid for current students, Oliveira and donors such as alumnus Peter L. Malkin ’55 advocated fundraising for the Law School’s Low Income Protection Plan, which offers loan relief to students who take jobs in lower-paying public sector and public interest work.
In addition to the top priority of financial aid, Oliveira said endowing professorships—particularly clinical professorships—is another major fundraising goal. At Harvard and around the country, hands-on clinical practice has started to replace and supplement the more traditional Socratic style of legal instruction.
While Oliveira was enthusiastic about the value of that kind of more personalized, practice-based education, he emphasized that it is also quite expensive, given small student-faculty ratios. Fundraising for clinical education presents more of a challenge than pitching something like financial aid, he said, because many alumni donors have no experience with clinical education and simply do not know much about it.
Minow, who was not available for an interview, pointed to “interdisciplinary teaching and learning,” research, and “student entrepreneurship and innovation” as other fundraising priorities in an email.
Some alumni are also hopeful that the campaign will provide an opportunity to fundraise for other projects. Charles Hieken, a 1957 alumnus who specializes in patent law and endowed a professorship at Harvard in the area, said he would like the study to receive still more support with this campaign.
A NEW GUARD
As much as this capital campaign, if awkwardly timed, provides an opportunity for Harvard Law School to fund some of its priorities as a school, it’s also a time for Oliveria and his team to continue another project for the school’s future: cultivating its next generation of donors.
Over the Law School’s last couple fundraising drives, Oliviera said, the school has drawn from the same generation of donors. With that group now aging and having served the school already, Oliveira and his team are looking for the next crop to step up. This process, which can take some time, is just another reason Oliveira said the campaign has a later start date.
“We need time to replenish our pipeline and convey the message that those generous benefactors did a great deal for the school, but now it was time for others to step forward,” Oliveira said.
“Planting those seeds, continuing to do that cultivation, watering and fertilizing those seeds as they grow 15 to 20 years from now, will yield rich dividends,” added Chu, one of the campaign’s co-chairs.
An important part of that courting process, according to Oliveira, is bringing alumni back to the Law School and showing them how it has changed and how it could improve further.
In some ways, then, this campaign is a sort of interlude to larger, more developed fundraising initiatives in the future.
“In some ways we are like a sports team that had its championship run and had a lot of veteran players retire, and then we basically had to build the farm team and get them playing at the major league level,” Oliveira said. “And so for us our next campaign is going to be the one that is much more comprehensive. And again we’ll create the opportunity of getting a deeper group of people supporting the school and then having them mature as donors and then being able to maximize what they can do for the school.”
For now, though, Oliveira is confident in the success of this current campaign within its defined scope. He said the inverted strategy has so far been successful and that he expects to surpass the goal, though he said the school would not raise it.
“Maybe we can do significantly better than we would have anticipated when the campaign was first planned,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 14, 2015, at 1:46 a.m.
After launching “Early Christianity: The Letters of Paul,” which claims to be the world’s largest Bible class with more than 32,000 participants, the Harvard Divinity School is aiming even higher with the introduction of its second online course called “Scripture,” which one Divinity School faculty member said she hopes will attract 50,000 students.
The class, which will be taught by six faculty members and focus on the texts of the world’s major religions, will premiere this spring through edX, the non-profit MOOC provider that Harvard and MIT founded in 2012.
Divinity School senior lecturer Diane L. Moore said she hopes for 15,000 students in each of the six modules and 50,000 unique students for the course as a whole.
“There’s a lot of misunderstanding about religion that has profound consequences both intellectually and civically,” she said. “We know how interesting the scriptures are to lots of people, and so we thought that organizing a course that would have a subtheme of better understanding religion through scripture would both attract a large audience and also be fun for us to put together.”
Moore, who will be teaching about religious literacy, said she had the idea for the course in spring of 2013 and was motivated by her work on the public’s understanding of religion.
For Faculty of Arts and Sciences professor Ali S. Asani, who will focus on the Quran in his lectures, the recent spike in Islamophobia was a driving factor in his participation.
“There are all kinds of wild stereotypes about the Quran in the light of Islamophobia. Some have claimed that the Quran is the work of the devil or that it is a book that espouses terrorism,” he said. “What I’m hoping is that my module will provide an informed and educated framework with which to think about this text.”
Despite the diverse range of texts and religions in the course, Asani noted that the teaching team has been planning to use comparative frameworks to highlight commonalities among the texts.
“We had several meetings in spring where we discussed key themes that we are going to be bringing up in each of our modules so there can be consistency across the modules,” he said. “I can imagine that in my module there may be a session with a panel discussion about themes and ideas that are shared by the scriptures.”
For Charles S. Hallisey, a senior lecturer at the Divinity School who will teach about Buddhist scriptures, the course also presents an opportunity to try out the edX platform.
“Part of my getting into this class was because I had misgivings about the phenomenon of online teaching,” he said. “Since getting involved, I’ve started to rethink the misgivings, and it’s been an interesting endeavor to rethink what is it that you want to do when you’re teaching.”
Overall, Moore says she hopes that the course will lead to a more nuanced understanding of scriptures and religion.
“Scriptures are wonderful religious resources that do have impact throughout all of human experience, and we’re excited to be able to share that knowledge and to hear from participants about their own experiences as they respond to the course,” she said.

UPDATED: October 14, 2015, at 1:51 a.m.
In a year of many changes at Harvard Management Company, Amy Falls, chief investment officer and vice president of investments at The Rockefeller University, was recently elected to HMC’s Board of Directors.
Falls, whose appointment was effective Sep. 28, worked at Morgan Stanley and Phillips Academy Andover before managing The Rockefeller University’s approximately $2 billion endowment. HMC announced the move on its website.
HMC manages the University’s now $37.6 billion endowment, which returned 5.8 percent last year and was again outpaced by many of Harvard’s peer institutions. 
New HMC CEO Stephen Blyth has vowed to make changes at the company in an effort to put Harvard in the top quartile of University endowment returns—a feat not accomplished since 2008. This year, two top level HMC executives have departed and a third, Andrew G. Wiltshire, announced plans to retire from his alternative assets managership at the end of the year.
“We have set ambitious investment objectives and I look forward to working with Amy and the HMC Board to deliver improved investment performance for Harvard University,” Blyth said in a press release. 
Paul J. Finnegan ’75, the University’s treasurer, a member of the Harvard Corporation, and the chair of HMC’s board, credited Falls as an important get for the Management Company.
“Amy is an excellent addition to the HMC Board. She joins at a particularly important time as we implement a new portfolio and organizational strategy, and I’m confident she will add significantly to our future growth and success in the years ahead,” Finnegan said in a press release.
Falls is an alumna of Georgetown University and the Kennedy School of Government, where she earned a master’s degree. She also serves as the treasurer of Phillips Academy Andover’s board of trustees, on the investment committee of the Peterson Institute of International Economics, and on the board of the Ford Foundation.

The divide between presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, frontrunners in the Democratic race, came to life beyond the Las Vegas venue on Tuesday night when supporters from both sides gathered for a debate watching party hosted by the Institute of Politics.
Cheering and applause was about even for the two leading Democratic candidates in a packed John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. 
Perhaps the loudest and most unified response in the room was to Sanders’ declaration to Clinton that “the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn email,” which elicited widespread laughter and applause from the crowd.
Support for the other candidates who participated in the debate—Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley, Virginia Senator Jim Webb, and former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee—was scant.
One of the strongest reactions to O’Malley was applause when he rebuked “Donald Trump folks.”
Other major topics touched on during the debate were gun control, race, inequality, and the Iraq War. When moderator Anderson Cooper mentioned consumption of cannabis, the room exploded with laughter.
“Tonight we saw candidates who have real visions for this country and can offer great leadership,” president of the Harvard Democrats Jacob R. Carrel ’16 wrote in an email. “Tonight’s candidates’ willingness to explain the reasons behind each of their policies underscores why they are legitimate candidates, and why many of the candidates in the Republican debates are simply not viable leaders for the American people.”
David K. Kilstein ’16, a member of Harvard United For Bernie, said, “support for Bernie has been doubling since May…quicker than for any other candidate.” 
President of the Harvard College Republicans Aaron I. Henricks ’16, who attended the IOP watch party, said he was underwhelmed by Sanders’ performance and the debate overall.
Peter C. Wright ’19, who identifies as a libertarian, also said that he was disappointed in Sanders’ performance.
apparently jokingly — that he would vote for O’Malley in 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 30 undergraduate students traveled to Long Island, N.Y. over the weekend to put on “Karisma,” a song-and-dance showcase that aimed to raise funds for Nepali earthquake relief as well as cancer research and treatment this year.
According to Meenakshi Krishna ’17, president and founding director of Karisma, the Office of Student Life gave funding to the students—most of whom belong to Harvard Bhangra dance company and Dharma, Harvard’s Hindu student organization—to travel.
“[Karisma] started off as a community arts showcase with people from local high schools dancing and participating,” Krishna said. According to Krishna, the organization has two central goals: To raise money for charities through artistic performances, and to bring together some of the best South Asian performers on the east coast.
Founded in 2012 by a group of college and high school students, Karisma has raised a total of $18,000 for various charities. This year, the showcase featured over a dozen dance and a capella groups and broke the organization’s records, garnering a total of $20,000 in one event. The proceeds from ticket sales and sponsorships will be donated to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and Help for Desperate and Needy People, Krishna added.
“With the recent earthquake in Nepal, HDNP Nepal takes the funds and manages immediate relief efforts including helping rebuild infrastructure and homes that have been destroyed in the earthquake,” Krishna said.
Performers included Yale Sur et Veritaal, an a capella group, and Columbia Bhangra, as well as Cornell Bhangra, which has been featured on America’s Got Talent, and Wanted Ashiqz, which has appeared on So You Think You Can Dance.
“This is one of the only showcase where these teams come together and perform for free,” Krishna said
Although Harvard Bhangra did not have a routine ready at the competition level to perform and will make its Karisma debut next year, Harvard still had a large presence at the event, according to Krishna.
“It was a wonderful celebration of South Asian culture and especially how it can blend with mainstream American culture, and of course it was great working for the benefit of such great charities,” said Neel Mehta ’18, one of Karisma’s co-hosts.
The event came together after nearly a year of planning on behalf of Karisma’s board, which currently includes 11 members, four of whom are from Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 60 minutes into play, the Harvard field hockey team found itself down one goal to Brown in a crucial conference tilt. The outcome of this game would be a big decider for Harvard in the Ivy League standings; a win would place them at third with a 4-3 record, while a loss would have them in the bottom half of the league with Penn and Dartmouth below .500.
But at a critical stage in the game, co-captain Elizabeth Jacobson took fate into her own hands. After drawing a penalty corner, junior forward Sarah Finnemore fed the ball into the attacking circle and Jacobson wasted no time in faking a pass to shake off the defense, firing a backhanded shot to find the back of the net to tie the game.
“That goal was not studied or practiced,” said coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “She just followed her intuition that led to the third goal…I think that shows her talent and capabilities.”
Only four minutes later, the Crimson was awarded yet another penalty corner. Jacobson again faked another pass and a spin before slicing a forehanded ball past the Bears’ goalkeeper Katie Hammaker to take the lead.
Jacobson’s two unassisted goals were the turning point for Harvard in the game against Brown. An insurance goal from sophomore forward Ellie Cookson later, the Crimson had sealed a 4-2 victory.
Jacobson is not only an influential player on the field, but off the field as well. Her transition into co-captain has been a seamless one.
“[Jacobson] is great on the field…she has awesome shots and is always accurate,” co-captain Caroline Code said. “Playing wise, she covers all the bases. But she’s also a great leader and co-captain – off the field she’s down to earth and fierce at the same time. She’s a powerhouse.”
Jacobson’s ascension to co-captain seemed natural to her peers and coach. Having frequently played the mid-fielder position in her previous years for the Crimson, Jacobson has seemed to truly find her place as a starting forward. With 41 shots this year, Jacobson only trails Balleza for the lead in Crimson shots.
Her move into more of an attacking position also signified her acceptance of a larger leadership role on the team.
“She has developed tremendously over the past few years,” van Herwaarden said. “She was always trying to become a team player as a midfielder, but I think [in] her role right now as captain and one of the starters up front she has matured as an athlete.”
Throughout the season thus far, Jacobson has totaled eight goals and four assists. Despite her numerous statistical achievements in field hockey, Jacobson would like her legacy to be about something other than points on a score-board.
“I want to leave my work ethic behind,” Jacobson said. “Just to be remembered as giving it my all, not holding back. Hopefully if Caroline and I give everything 100 percent it leads the team to give 100 percent. I think it’s definitely something I strive to leave behind.”
The team is scheduled for four more Ivy League matches later in the season, with a game against Cornell this weekend. To establish the Crimson field hockey program on the national stage is also something that Jacobson hopes to see.
“Our main goal for the season is growth and progress,” Jacobson said. “To get Harvard on the map for field hockey in the country. Winning Ivies is definitely awesome and a goal for us, but our main goal is to set up for the season to come.”
Making an impact on the Ivy stage is something that seems within reach for Jacobson and the team.
“Eli is having the best season of her career so far,” van Herwaarden said. “She seems to have the right energy week in week out for each game. Hopefully we’ll enjoy seven more games of this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­On a two-game road trip this past Sunday, the Harvard men’s water polo team (7-7, 4-3 CWPA) easily handled Connecticut College (0-8, 0-5), winning 16-7, but fell short at No. 12 Brown (13-3, 7-0), 16-12, in what amounted to a day of pretty familiar results.
Earlier this season, Harvard cruised past the Camels, 17-5, but lost a heartbreaker to the Bears, 10-9, on a deflected last-second shot in overtime. This time around, a seven-goal fourth-quarter rally against Brown still was not enough for the Crimson to pull off the upset.
“We played well, but we’ve got some work to do,” said sixth-year coach Ted Minnis. “We’re not peaking at this point.”
BROWN 16, HARVARD 12
The Crimson rode its balanced offensive and defensive effort against Connecticut College into Providence to face the Bears, taking a 4-3 first-quarter lead on goals by co-captain Ben Zepfel, junior defenseman Dan Stevens, junior co-captain Joey Colton, and freshman attacker Grayson Judge.
But Brown junior goalie Luke Weiser shut the game down after that, allowing only one more goal through the second and third quarters, frustrating the Harvard offense and enabling the Bears offense to go on a 9-1 run, at one point scoring seven goals in a row. Weiser finished the game with 17 saves.
Senior Crimson goalie Colin Woolway, meanwhile, was unable to stop the onslaught, recording only one save in the second quarter.
“We have to tighten things up defensively, especially on our help defense,” Minnis said. “We could use a little more work on our special teams.”
Down 12-5 heading into the final period of play, Harvard surged forward once again with another balanced attack, rallying with pairs of goals from Zepfel, Colton, and senior attacker Blake Lee, in addition to another from Judge, but the late surge fell short as Harvard was unable to overcome the deficit.
“We definitely don’t give up,” Stevens said. “Despite whatever the score says, we go out there and fight for the goal every single time.”
The Crimson’s leading scorer, senior attacker Noah Harrison, was kept off the scoreboard, but Zepfel, Colton, and Lee all ended the game with hat tricks.
For Brown, sophomore standout Tyler Kirchberg scored a game-high five goals, while junior utility man Warren Smith netted a hat trick.
The Crimson remains at .500 overall on the season, but the squad has won three of its last four and six of its last nine matches. The loss dropped Harvard to 4-3 in conference play ahead of its match against MIT and the Ivy championships next weekend.
“We’ll get some rest tonight, get back to practice early tomorrow, watch some film, and figure out where we need to tighten up our phases of the game,” Minnis said.
HARVARD 16, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 7
In its first game of the day, Harvard raced out to a commanding 12-2 halftime lead, spearheaded by scoring from Zepfel—who entered the day as the team’s second-leading scorer—junior attacker Viktor Wrobel, and sophomore utility man Colin Chiapello.
“We executed on the offensive end,” Minnis said. “We did a good job of getting good shots off.”
The Crimson’s attack picked up where it left off after last week’s 22-score performance against Iona. Since its September 19th home win over Connecticut College, the Harvard offense has averaged a mark of over 14 goals per game.
The defense also contributed its fair share to the victory, holding the winless Camels to only three goals through the first three quarters. Over its last seven games, the Crimson has held its opponents to single digit tallies four times.
Shutdown defense also led to more breakaways the other way.
“Our counterattacks spurred our offense,” Stevens said. “They created a lot of great opportunities to score.”
Harvard led 5-2 at the end of the first quarter before pouring on seven more goals in the next frame. Meanwhile, the Crimson’s defense put up a zero-spot in the second quarter.
Harvard closed out the game after halftime, briefly extending its win streak to three games before its game against Brown snapped it.

Take a drink…
for every candidate you don’t recognize (wait, people other than Hillary and Bernie are running?)
Seriously though, who are these guys?
for every time Bernie gesticulates wildly
 for every bad joke about Donald Trump
Finish your drink…
 for every mention of Hillary’s email scandal
 for every shameless appeal to young voters that falls flat 
 for every issue Bernie accuses Hillary of flip-flopping on
 for every time Bernie says the word “socialism” and people get uncomfortable
Take a shot…
for the first time someone in the room complains that Lessig isn’t debating
for any mention of Benghazi or the Benghazi committee
for realizing that you really haven’t been following politics well at all
