After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past few months, I’ve written a half-dozen columns examining the ethics and rationale behind a variety of space initiatives. But there’s one central question that I have yet to tackle: Why should we care about space exploration in the first place?
Some space enthusiasts choose to ignore this question altogether. If you ask them why you ought to care about space, they might look at you like you’re crazy — “Well, why wouldn’t you? Are you, like, against science or something?” But when billions of taxpayer dollars are going into space-related research every year, and the benefit to the public is not always evident, the “why” question needs to be addressed.
Unfortunately, the common arguments in favor of space exploration have glaring holes in their logic.
Take a hypothetical space enthusiast. He might begin his defense of space spending by citing all the useful technologies that have been created as a result of space exploration. This point is indisputable — the list of technologies that NASA has produced or refined is extensive, ranging from portable laptops to baby formula. But if our primary desire is the production of useful consumer technologies, a space agency doesn’t seem like the most intuitive place to invest. Plenty of other industries could produce similar technologies if given NASA’s multi-billion dollar budget, and they likely could do so more efficiently, given that the development of these technologies is only one small part of NASA’s overall mission.
The space geek might then point out that going after NASA for financial reasons is misguided. After all, NASA’s funding only makes up 0.5 percent of the total U.S. budget; if you really wanted to save money, you’d best look elsewhere. But this is where we wade into politically divisive waters — what exactly can we scale back instead of NASA? If you said (as I’m inclined to) that the military is the most deserving of a budget cut, you’d immediately lose the attention of many conservative listeners. A call to slash social spending would be dismissed by the progressive bloc. It would be nigh-impossible to find any element of the U.S. budget that could be slashed with bipartisan support — that is, perhaps, besides NASA itself.
At this point, the space fanatic might pull out one last desperate card: Space research is necessary in order to protect the human race. If we never branch out to other planets, then we’re all sitting ducks waiting to be wiped out by the next extinction event. And, indeed, this might be true in the long term. But in the short term, we don’t have the capability to transport humans to another planet en masse, and making a distant planet fully habitable is certainly out of reach. So, for now, it’s more important to keep Earth safe than to start colonizing another planet; fighting existential threats like climate change is actually feasible, and climate research could certainly benefit from an annual budget of $22.6 billion.
So, it seems, our space enthusiast has failed to provide a convincing defense of space spending.
Now for the dramatic twist — that hypothetical space advocate was actually me, about two days ago, when I sat down to write this final column. At first, I wanted to write a traditional defense of space spending, but I quickly realized that every argument I constructed or encountered online had major holes in its logic. As a result, I was forced to ask myself: Does my deeply-held passion for space exploration actually have no logical basis?
And, I realized, the answer is yes. The very act of exploring space — launching humans on giant hunks of metal to go wander around distant space rocks — is a deeply illogical undertaking. Still, millions of humans across the globe are inspired by daring space missions, even if those missions offer no tangible benefit to their own lives.
To me, this is because space research — from the search for extraterrestrial life to figuring out how to get humans to Mars — is more of a spiritual pursuit than a pragmatic one. It excites and fascinates us; it satisfies our collective desire to learn more about the unknown — to go where we’ve never been before. Space allows us to explore our deepest questions about the nature of our role in the universe.
Asking why we should fund space exploration is like asking why we should fund art. Arguments rooted in pragmatism miss the point — that space exploration is for the heart and soul.
That said, not everyone will get the same fulfillment from space, like not everyone finds value in the same work of art. So, it’s important that we space advocates be flexible in order to keep our dream alive.
When pragmatists point out that the money currently going towards space seems excessive, we should say, “You know, you might be right,” and look for alternatives — like an emphasis on less-expensive unmanned space exploration or partnerships between NASA and private companies. When they tell us that some space initiatives — like terraforming — are unrealistic, we should abandon those goals. And when they ask what tangible benefits can be reaped from outer space, we should point out the potential opportunities to turn a profit — like asteroid mining.
These are all ideas that I’ve explored in this column. I’m obviously one of the people who finds great spiritual fulfillment through our exploration of space, but I completely understand that not everyone feels the same way. I urge my fellow space enthusiasts to recognize that our passion is not shared by everyone; in response, we should always be looking for cheaper and more efficient ways to carry out the big goals that we would love to see accomplished.
If we want to take the next giant leaps, we mustn’t step on too many toes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the question on everybody’s mind, whispered in Zoom sessions, texted surreptitiously to half the members of a group chat, relegated finally to the Harvard Confessions Facebook page: “Are you willing to do another semester of online classes?” And the results of the recent Undergraduate Council survey offer some jaw-dropping numbers — over 45 percent of undergraduates are “very likely” or “already planning” to ask for a leave of absence if the fall semester will be online.
All eyes now turn apprehensively to see the reaction from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences planning team, led by Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs and Registrar Michael P. Burke. Rumors are already swirling that administrators will try to stem the exodus by drastically limiting access to leaves of absence. I don’t want to assume the committee’s decisions, but it’s important to be clear on one point:
Restricting leaves would be a huge and unnecessary mistake. Here’s why.
First, even a simple quantitative model makes it evident that the problem isn’t as big as it seems. My initial intuition was wrong and, if you’re panicking, yours is probably wrong too. If 50 percent of the student body takes a leave of absence, that does not mean 50 percent overcrowding when they come back. Overcrowding is a result of students sticking around longer than they otherwise would — if half the student body takes a semester off, Harvard is looking at a shortfall of 800 beds every fall for the next three years, as half of the just-graduated class stays for an extra semester. Instead of a 50 percent problem, we’re looking at a 12.5 percent shortfall.
Not only would restrictions create bad blood by signaling (I believe incorrectly) that FAS cares more about its bottom line than about the students that vivify its community, such restrictions would be unnecessary. Yes, there’s a resources crunch on its way — when students return from leave, the College can expect overcrowded houses, classrooms, dining halls, health, and mental health clinics — but proactive steps can manage the burden without the need to reduce students’ choice. I made some quick models to help me think about the problem, and I want to offer one set of solutions.
For these sample calculations, I assume that each class is 1600 students, and I imagine the worst-case scenario in which 50 percent of current students elect for a one-semester leave — 800 per class. As a side note, later returns of the UC survey showed lower interest in leaves, so the actual rate is probably under 45 percent. Also notice that the assumption of one-semester leaves puts the burden entirely on the fall, with no extra students in spring semesters.
To start, the College needs to smooth out leaves of absence so the burden doesn’t land entirely on fall semesters. Much of this will happen naturally. I would set a target of having 200 additional people from each grade take a fall gap semester before graduation. This will allow many students to graduate on-cycle and participate in normal hiring and graduate school application cycles. If distributed evenly, it will also smooth the resource crunch to a 600-bed shortfall in the fall and a 200-bed shortfall in the spring for each of the next three years.
Next, the College should loosen its future obligations. It sucks to say that incoming classes have to be smaller, but that’s the easiest way to relieve strain. If we have a one-time 200-person reduction in the size of the Class of 2025, we then reduce the bed shortfall from 600 in the fall and 200 in the spring to 400 in fall and zero in the spring for the three problem years.
With a crunch of 400 students remaining each fall, it’s time to get creative. I offer the following proposals to get the conversation started:
First, let some students pull the plug early and graduate after seven semesters. This will help accommodate those who need to enter the job market or apply to graduate schools at a particular time in the year, but who would otherwise be off-cycle. If "credits" are an issue, the College should move to expand advanced standing, recognize more high school classes, and be more lenient about the (already deeply dysfunctional) general education requirements (don't get me started on how my three departmental courses about science in society apparently aren't enough to fulfill the “science in society” requirement).
Second, give students the opportunity to spend a fall semester “abroad” as part of non-competitive cohorts at Harvard graduate schools like the Kennedy School and the Graduate School of Education — almost like studying abroad, but still in Cambridge. Open to juniors and seniors, this program would give experience and a resume boost to students who are considering related career paths, without too much distance from their current academic support networks. Students would be responsible for their own housing, but they'd be close enough to remain affiliated with their undergraduate house. To make this even more appealing, Harvard could cap tuition at the College rate and pledge to transfer financial aid.
Finally, open competitive slots for seniors to leave Harvard College a semester early to join professional schools, like Harvard Medical School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Business School. For students who are off-cycle, their skipped eighth semester would otherwise be in the fall, so they would join professional programs on the normal schedule. Again, tuition (for that one semester, at least) is capped, with financial aid transferring over. By keeping admission competitive, this program would be a way for Harvard to demonstrate that it has students’ best interests in mind, while also maintaining the value of professional school degrees and reducing the College resource burden.
Rather than making any quick policy announcements about leaves of absence, the FAS planning committee should commit to making decisions based on detailed quantitative models. Crises are a test of compassion. Instead of opening Pandora’s box by ignoring students’ reasonable and deeply-held preferences for leaves of absence, Harvard should seize this golden opportunity to ease the resource crunch while also demonstrating its commitment to students’ personal, academic, and career goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a virtual bargaining session with its graduate student union Friday, Harvard proposed creating a one-year contract that addresses compensation and health care provisions, according to email updates from both parties.
The proposed contract reiterates Harvard’s original offers: granting student workers a 2.8 percent wage increase and establishing funds for health and dental insurance and child care, associate provost Doreen Koretz and director of employee and labor relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an emailed announcement Friday.
Koretz and Curran wrote that the University decided to shorten a multi-year agreement to a one-year pact “due to the economic uncertainty for future fiscal years” in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
“The reality of the University’s economic position does impact our negotiations with HGSU-UAW,” Koretz and Curran wrote. “This was not a decision the University made lightly.”
Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers is considering the University’s offer, union representative Justin Bloesch wrote in an email update to members Monday.
“We are waiting to hear about more dates from the administration and are evaluating these changes,” Bloesch wrote.
Friday’s development follows nearly a full academic year of bargaining sessions between the union and the University. In early December, the union went on strike over three key issues: compensation, health insurance, and discrimination and sexual harassment procedures.
But after nearly four weeks on the picket line, the student workers returned to work without a contract on January 1, enlisting a federal mediator to facilitate bargaining. Despite agreeing to several other tentative provisions since then, the two parties remain in gridlock over HGSU-UAW’s three key demands.
In their Friday message, Koretz and Curran wrote that the University “continues to have concerns” about the union's demand for a “traditional labor arbitration” procedure for allegations of workplace harassment and discrimination.
“As we have shared previously, among other things, the University believes the proposal would not be consistent with current or proposed federal Title IX regulations in that it would create a separate process for HGSU-UAW members that is not available to other members of the Harvard community,” they wrote.
Before Friday’s bargaining session, the union and the University had engaged in one remote bargaining session, on March 25, since Harvard closed its campus and switched to remote instruction due to the coronavirus outbreak. The union has expressed concerns about graduate students’ workload, health care, and research funding amid the public health crisis, and graduate students have called on the University to provide them with a fully-funded “COVID-19 bridge year” to compensate them for research projects disrupted by the pandemic.
In response to the coronavirus outbreak, Harvard guaranteed regular pay and benefits to University employees through June 28, and Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences launched an Emergency Support Initiative to provide funding and fellowship opportunities to students impacted by COVID-19.
Still, the University faces numerous economic challenges in light of the pandemic. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences was unable to cover its budget for Fiscal Year 2020 due to experiencing $30 million in losses related to the outbreak.
In March, HGSU-UAW alleged Harvard asked to suspend bargaining for several weeks while the University reevaluated its financial situation — a claim Harvard denied.
Koretz and Curran wrote Friday that Harvard is evaluating the unfolding financial obstacles posed by the pandemic as it continues negotiations with the union.
“In the face of the very real challenges brought to the University and the wider community by the global pandemic, these offers, which come at a time when many other University employees are undergoing a salary freeze, represent the limit of the University’s capacity for salary increases and financial support to student workers at this time,” Koretz and Curran wrote.
Correction: May 5, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard was unable to cover its budget for Fiscal Year 2020 due to experiencing $30 million in losses related to the outbreak. In fact, it was the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is unlikely to “return to normal” by September, University President Lawrence S. Bacow told the Faculty of Arts and Sciences over Zoom during its final meeting of the academic year Tuesday.
“It’s pretty clear to all of us that we are unlikely to see things return to normal, ex ante, by September,” Bacow said. “People are just working nonstop as we sort through the alternatives as we plan for the fall, reimagining new ways to be excellent.”
At the faculty meeting, Bacow reiterated the University’s plan to reopen its research facilities in phases, after ordering all FAS-affiliated laboratories to ramp down to only essential functions in March.
But he said the return of students to campus en masse will likely come later.
“We are working to stand up our research operations as fast as we possibly can,” he said. “We think it is possible to get this going faster than bringing students back in large numbers.”
He added that the effects of the pandemic on Harvard have only begun to materialize, and said more sacrifices will likely be necessary.
“To use a baseball metaphor, if this is a nine-inning game, it’s unclear if we’re in the bottom of the first inning or the top of the second,” he said.
At a meeting that FAS Dean Claudine Gay termed “unlike any other that has come before,” faculty attended from their homes via Zoom and used the “raise hand” function to be recognized to speak. They voted on motions via Zoom’s polling function.
The faculty unanimously approved the proposed courses of instruction for the fall semester for the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Harvard Extension School. They also passed a proposal to simplify the College’s rules for simultaneous course enrollment, allowing some courses to receive a three-year blanket waiver for students to simultaneously enroll in them without petitioning to do so.
While Harvard has announced that it will hold classes in the fall — whether online or in person — the FAS still has not decided what format its upcoming semester will take. Gay wrote in an email to faculty in late April that the FAS will reach a final decision no later than July. Meanwhile, the Extension School will likely hold its fall courses exclusively online, interim dean Henry H. Leitner said during Tuesday’s meeting.
Faculty have since begun planning in earnest for the possibility of continued online teaching, working with departments and FAS administrators to find ways to ensure academic continuity for students.
In Tuesday’s meeting, the faculty also approved changes to the College’s student handbook for the 2020-21 school year. They agreed to move the deadline by which students can withdraw from courses from the seventh Monday to the eleventh Monday of the term, and to prorate course requirements for students who conduct term-time study abroad.
The faculty also briefly discussed the issue of fossil fuel divestment. The FAS overwhelmingly approved a resolution in February urging the University to eliminate its investments in the industry; in response, the Harvard Corporation in April adopted a commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from its endowment by 2050.
Philosophy professor Edward J. “Ned” Hall said during Tuesday’s meeting he and a number of his colleagues welcome decarbonization as a “very important first step,” but are concerned about the plan’s timeline and efficacy.
“Our concern is that this pace is too slow, and suggests an unrealistic hope that the climate system won’t force our hand well before then,” Hall said. “Climate scientists are continually shortening the time horizon for effective action, and a 2050 target date does not jibe with the urgency of our situation.”
Hall also questioned how the University could achieve decarbonization while still maintaining investments in fossil fuel companies.
In response, Bacow said the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — ultimately found the decarbonization plan, rather than divestment, to be in the University’s best interest.
“We believe we can have a greater overall impact if we can curb demand for fossil fuels rather than focusing on supply,” Bacow said.
Bacow also said decarbonizing the entire portfolio was an “ambitious goal” even on the current 2050 timeline.
“If we can meet that goal faster, we will,” Bacow said. “We pledged to report on our progress, and we will plan to do so on a regular basis.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School immigration experts said a recent executive order suspending immigration to the United States will especially harm young children and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.
United States President Donald Trump issued the order on April 22, pausing immigration for a 60-day period with certain exceptions, including for health care workers temporarily migrating to assist with the ongoing pandemic. Its aim is to preserve healthcare resources and jobs for American citizens, according to the order.
“In the administration of our Nation’s immigration system, we must be mindful of the impact of foreign workers on the United States labor market, particularly in an environment of high domestic unemployment and depressed demand for labor,” it reads.
Law School professor Gerald L. Neuman ’73 — who teaches immigration and nationality law— called the order an abuse of power that would separate the children of permanent residents from their families. The proclamation includes an exception for children under the age of 21, but only if their parents are U.S. citizens.
“The proclamation appears to use the current crisis as a pretext for imposing limitations that the White House has proposed in the past and that Congress has shown no interest in adopting,” Neuman wrote in an email. “Moreover, even on its own stated rationale, there is no conceivable justification for suspending the immigration of young children of lawful permanent residents.”
The executive order also contains an exception for those already living in the county seeking naturalization.
Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic staff attorney Jason M. Corral said he thinks that exception significantly limits the order’s scope.
He added, however, that the suspension could incite xenophobia by directing blame for the economic crisis and high unemployment on immigrants. Corral also noted that the Trump administration issued the order shortly before the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which offers temporary protections to hundreds of thousands of qualified undocumented youth across the country.
In Oct. 2019, Harvard and 18 other colleges and universities filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of DACA, warning its termination would damage the institutions’ recruitment and retention of undocumented students.
Corral explained that many DACA recipients receive permanent residency through a procedure called consular processing, in which a case is reviewed at a U.S. embassy abroad.
“We've seen some students be able to take advantage of implementing this, and they have to leave the country and come back in and process from the embassy abroad,” he said.
With the executive order suspending the processing of cases abroad, Corral voiced concerns that DACA recipients could lose another avenue to achieve residency.
“At the same time that we're seeing the possibility of DACA being taken away, it's also eliminating the opportunity for those folks to regularize their status in such a way where they would no longer need DACA,” he said.
Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School, echoed similar concerns in an online statement. He contends the executive order is likely to encounter legal challenges.
“An executive order suspending all immigration into the United States is outrageous and likely unconstitutional,” he wrote. “We have never done that before, even during world wars.”
Corral said that the United States should not impose harsh restrictions or uproot immigrants during a time of crisis.
“We should be trying to make sure that people are able to stay and continue working and help rebound the economy once we all do get back to work,” he said.

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council voted to fund a partnership with meditation app Headspace at its final general meeting of the semester on Sunday.
The new partnership provides a free one-year subscription to Headspace for 1,030 students and offers a 90 percent discount — $7 for the yearly subscription — for all other students.
The legislation states the Council will hold a lottery for the free subscriptions and prioritize students eligible for the Student Events Fund, a program that provides certain students on financial aid with discounted event tickets.
UC treasurer Noah Harris ’22 sponsored the legislation along with Ryan V. Sears ’22, chair of the Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee, and Jenny Y. Gan ’22, chair of the First-Year Class Committee.
“We just wanted the UC to always be looking out for ways to increase the mental health of students and find ways to support students especially during the summer or, if we won’t be back, in the fall,” Harris said. “We see Headspace as a really awesome tool that can meet some of those needs that students are having.”
The Council allocated $7,200 from its budget to fund the partnership.
Gan said the Council is doing its best to share mental health resources with students. She said that, ideally, every student who wanted a counselor from Counseling and Mental Health Services would have access to one, but that some students may not be able to take full advantage of CAMHS resources.
UC members argued that Headspace could potentially fill the need for mental health resources.
“Meditation and mindfulness, which is what Headspace does, has been shown to significantly decrease mental health effects,” Gan said.
Some representatives raised questions about the number of undergraduates who would be interested in a Headspace subscription, as well as the app’s focus on mindfulness and meditation.
Lowell House representative M. Thorwald “Thor” Larson ’21 spoke against the legislation. He said Headspace may not meet the needs of those the partnership aims to help.
Larson contended that a student group on campus devoted to mental health — Student Mental Health Liaisons — want text-based counseling and support groups.
“There is really not widespread enthusiasm for just mindfulness stuff even though some of the members there use Headspace and other apps,” Larson said. “We need to make sure that we are providing things these communities want.”
At Sunday’s meeting, held virtually on Zoom, the Council also voted to submit its recommendations for the recognition status of provisional student organizations. The Council is authorized to make recommendations to the Committee on Student Life, which then makes the final decisions.
Rules Committee chair Carter H. Nakamoto ’21 discussed the details of specific provisional student organizations after the Council moved into an executive session, which is private and off-the-record.
The Council recommended all 33 provisional organizations that interviewed with the Rules Committee to obtain full recognition status.

Comedian and television host Conan C. O’Brien ’85 will speak at the Class of 2020’s virtual Commencement celebration on May 28, Harvard wrote in an email to College seniors Tuesday afternoon.
After the coronavirus crisis sent undergraduates home and shuttered campus in March, the University announced that it would award degrees and honor the graduates with a virtual ceremony on May 28.
O’Brien is best known for hosting the late-night talk shows “Late Night with Conan O’Brien,” “The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien,” and, since 2010, “Conan.” As a Harvard undergraduate, he served as president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
O’Brien last came to campus in 2016 for a sit-down discussion with former University President Drew G. Faust about his career and the value of a liberal arts education. He also delivered the 2000 Class Day speech, during which he humorously warned graduates that they were “in for a lifetime of ‘And you went to Harvard?’”
The live-streamed celebration for graduating seniors will immediately follow a University-wide event, which will begin at 11:00 a.m. During the larger celebration, Harvard will confer degrees, mailing diplomas to students’ permanent addresses shortly thereafter.
Aside from O’Brien’s speech, the undergraduate event will feature a video made by class members, remarks from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, appearances by the 2020 Class Marshals, greetings from faculty deans, and a number of “student-driven” features, including festive videos and musical performances.
The celebration will also honor seniors who have done “extraordinary work” to serve the College at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis.
In addition to the virtual commencement programming, University President Lawrence S. Bacow previously assured the Class of 2020 that Harvard would host “traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement” as soon as large gatherings are considered safe. The canonical festivities include the Class of 2020 photograph, the Class of 2020 family reception, and the Class Day picnic, among other events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge real estate market’s pricing and demand has remained mostly steady amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to area brokers and landlords.
Though the virus has forced property owners to conduct virtual showings and some are allowing for greater flexibility, the market has not seen a major shock.
“Cambridge isn’t just Harvard students. Cambridge is a mix of people from all kinds of places doing all kinds of jobs,” said Alan Savenor, who manages Plum Properties, LLC. “And so there’s still pretty good demand out there.”
Jeremy Raynor, a rental agent for Apartment Rental Experts, said the cancellation of in-person summer programming at Harvard has not had a noticeable effect on demand for rentals.
Summer housing at the DeWolfe Street Apartments, which are normally available for license to Harvard undergraduates, has been suspended due to the pandemic.
Raynor said some landlords have opted to lower rent slightly and are allowing for greater flexibility on some policies.
“Definitely on the time, the move-in date, the price, and pet policies, I’ve personally noticed a fair amount of flexibility,” he said.
The City of Cambridge enacted an emergency order last month barring evictions and “non-essential entry” by property owners and agents. Landlords have now switched to showing properties virtually.
“You need to point out not only the pros of the apartment, but you need to point out the cons as well,” Raynor said. “You want to make sure that when people do move into an apartment in September that they know what they’re getting, and they’re going to be happy in that apartment.”
Myra von Turkovich, a Cambridge realtor with Leading Edge Real Estate, said the showing process is “a different animal” amid the coronavirus. Despite a decrease in inventory, she said properties put up for sale on market are selling at or above the asking price.
For short-term Airbnb renters, however, the virus has been more disruptive.
Robert Najarian, a Cambridge-based actor who rents out his room via Airbnb while he travels for work to help with mortgage costs, said he has seen demand fall to zero amid the pandemic. After the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Najarian said, all of his scheduled reservations were cancelled within days.
“There has been radio silence for any kind of reservations,” he said.
The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Airbnb is expected to lose $1 billion in the first half of 2020 as many hosts are struggling amid a mass surge in cancellations.
Patricia Mazza, a longtime Cambridge real estate broker, said that, as the state of the fall semester at Harvard remains uncertain, so too does the property rentals market. Mazza said many of her tenants are academics and visiting scholars at the University.
“It’s just not a predictable market for anyone,” she said.
George Zygouris, director of sales and operations at Cambridge Realty Group, said he has seen a dip in the market but expects it to recover.
“Obviously, the universities affect the markets. They always do around here,” he said. “Usually when the economy dips, people go back to school. So the Cambridge market is always going to maintain, if not survive. We may have a little dip right now, but in general, it’s a strong market and it always will be.”
Savenor, the Plum Properties manager, said he isn’t concerned about the impact of a potential remote fall semester.
“I think it will affect less the demand for my apartments, but it will probably more affect the mix of people that I get,” he said. “Cambridge is a melting pot for people from all over the world, whether they’re in school or not. I expect that if a graduate student doesn’t take it, then some young professional person will take it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 170 members of the Harvard Medical School faculty and their supporters sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow on Sunday criticizing the school’s plan to commit its $40.9 billion endowment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Bacow wrote in an announcement to faculty last month that the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — asked the Harvard Management Company to formulate a plan for achieving a greenhouse-gas neutral endowment by 2050 and present it to the board by the end of 2020.
The Medical School faculty members wrote in a letter, that as physicians and scientists responding to the coronavirus pandemic, they understood the consequences of delayed public health action, and called on administrators to divest entirely from fossil fuels.
“We are extremely concerned that the plan described in your letter detailing Harvard’s response (4/21) — i.e. to continue investing the endowment in the fossil fuel industry with a plan for a carbon neutral portfolio by 2050 — is both inadequate and far too delayed to mitigate the catastrophic environmental and health consequences of climate change,” they wrote.
On Feb. 12, the Medical School’s faculty council joined the choir of faculty voices advocating for divestment, voting 23-5 in favor of the Harvard Corporation removing investments in the fossil fuel industry. This vote occurred days after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted overwhelmingly in favor of divestment.
In their letter to Bacow, the Medical School faculty wrote that lives are at stake with the increasing rise of temperature, a product of climate change.
“We are already experiencing increasing heat-related illness, trauma and displacement from intense storms and wildfires, and climate-related increases in infectious diseases, lung disease, and cardiovascular disease,” they wrote. “These consequences will only worsen without prompt forceful action. In response to this unprecedented crisis, we must act swiftly.”
The letter also implores Harvard to act as a leader in the fight against climate change. The faculty referenced the University of Oxford’s decision to divest as a model for Harvard.
“Despite repeated queries, no evidence has been shared to date to support the contention that Harvard’s engagement with the fossil fuel industry has fostered substantive changes in these companies’ behaviors or intent to continue to profit from exploration, extraction, transport, and sales of fossil fuels,” the letter reads. “We also question the claim that divestment will unjustly vilify the individuals working within fossil fuel companies and prevent forward-thinking collaboration.”
Asked for comment, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton referenced Bacow’s original letter to faculty.
In his April announcement, Bacow said the University’s commitment aims to reduce the demand for fossil fuels.
“As noted, the strategy we plan to pursue focuses on reducing the demand for fossil fuels, not just the supply, an action consistent with the University’s overall commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our operations,” Bacow wrote.
Medical School professor Caren G. Solomon ’84, who signed the letter, wrote in an email to The Crimson that climate change requires “prompt and aggressive action.”
“We want to convey to President Bacow and the Corporation that physicians and scientists at Harvard certainly agree with a plan to decarbonize the endowment and the university, but believe that to protect health, we must move to achieve this rapidly and definitively,” Solomon wrote. “As we note in the letter, Covid-19 has underscored the risks of a delayed and inadequate response to a crisis.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Lowell House tutor Evander L. Price, having students to support is what keeps him going during the coronavirus pandemic.
“I, as a tutor, have built a lot of my identity around the fact that I've got these 400 some undergraduate students who look up to me for no particularly good reason except for the fact that I have the word tutor next to my name,” Price said. “That's an awesome, awesome superpower. It gets me out of bed.”
Price is among the ranks of resident tutors who remain in Harvard’s undergraduate houses after most students vacated campus in March due to the growing concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. Joined by the several hundred students still residing in the Houses, they have carried on their duties as tutors while their students have scattered across the country and the globe.
Since students’ departure, House resident tutors have balanced their responsibilities for their students, Houses, and jobs — all the while taking care of themselves in the middle of an unprecedented time in the history of Harvard’s campus.
In March, the Dean of Students Office began enforcing strict social distancing guidelines in residential spaces, including restricting gatherings of more than two, assigning individual living spaces and bathrooms, and reducing dining service. Tutors living under these guidelines are experiencing House life differently from any other time they’ve known.
Lowell tutor Hannah R. Shaffer described the House as a “ghost town” and said she rarely interacts with other tutors in person.
“Typically I would hang out with other tutors, just because we're all friends,” she said. “So, like everyone else, I've been struggling with the isolation that comes from quarantine.”
Though typical tutor responsibilities such as connecting regularly with her entryway have become more difficult, Shaffer said other duties remain relatively normal, such as her role as a Lowell fellowships chair.
“Around this time, we would always need to write letters for students who are being nominated for House prizes,” she said. “That obviously didn't change at all, I spent many hours writing recommendation letters.”
Khin-Kyemon Aung ’14, a tutor in Dunster House, said that much of the difficulty in performing tutor duties remotely is due to lack of personal interactions with students.
“So much of what a resident tutor does is not only the advising sessions that are formally scheduled, but it's really about those interactions in the dining hall where you catch up with someone and get a pulse on how things are going,” she said. “It's really where you become a family.”
In addition to shouldering responsibilities to students, tutors continued to perform jobs outside of the Houses. Ranging from research to residencies to teaching, resident tutors have also made the often bumpy transition to working from home.
After finishing her Business School classes this spring, Aung will begin a year of residency at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. She said preparing — both physically and mentally — for the assignment has taken up much of her time in the last month.
“It's very much in the front of my mind of: How do I prepare to become a good doctor to prepare for my intern year?” she said. “Can I brush up on my skills and be ready to go on day one of intern year? And so that's what I've been thinking about a lot in the past couple of weeks.”
Lowell tutor Kelly A. Miller said that teaching has kept her focused and grounded. Miller teaches ENG-SCI 96: “Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project,” and said she checks in on her students’ progress multiple times a week.
“Having the classes and the teaching to focus on has been really helpful, it's provided like some structure to my day,” she said. “I'm a little bit nervous about what it's going to look like after this is over. Just going back to regular research and stuff is going to be tough.”
Shaffer said working on her research — which concerns the criminal justice system — “saved” her. Shaffer also said she spent roughly 10 hours every day on Zoom working with a colleague for the past month.
“I've mostly been working, which has been nice to have something,” she said. “I’d say motivation is very high on that front, which I'm very lucky for.”
Outside of House responsibilities and job demands, tutors say they are struggling to cope with empty Houses and a lack of daily interaction with their students.
Price said that he built his “identity” around his role as a tutor. Without students in the House, however, he feels that identity has been damaged.
“All of the things I normally do for fun that I have incorporated into things that are too for students are just gone,” he said. “So, for me as a tutor, I feel like a tremendous structure of things that I've built my identity into has been temporarily erased.”
Price also said he has struggled a “tremendous amount” to maintain a daily routine.
“I think I'm disappointed in myself with what I've come up with to do in that time and also I'm not sure what precisely I am supposed to do,” he said. “I think unmotivated is the word, I think we're all a little depressed. I think it would be unhealthy if you weren't.”
Aung said the lack of students left her feeling like there was a “hole” in the House.
“When I come back to my room, you look at empty halls with some of the name tags still left on the doors and you can't help but wonder how those students are doing,” she said.
“You might send them a text message just checking in on them, but not to be able to just say, 'Hey, what's going on?' and know that you have students living next to you who could come by and say hi at any time. It's something that I definitely miss,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 16, 2020, 12:52 p.m.
The Harvard Extension Students Association — the official student government of the Extension School — shared Monday that Jacob Khan would serve as the next President of its executive board, after defeating his opponent Dale A. Manzo in a runoff election characterized by controversy.
On April 28, Extension School student Nor M. Rizek raised allegations of assault against Khan in a post in the Extension School Facebook group.
Rizek said Khan had invited her to The Sinclair, a Cambridge music venue, in November. Shortly after she arrived, Rizek alleged Khan began “forcefully” grabbing her arm, physically forcing her to leave the premises.
Rizek said she repeatedly told Khan to stop touching her and leave her alone. She said she eventually broke away, at which point another student at the venue grabbed Rizek, leaving bruises, blood, and scratches on her body. Khan then pulled that student away.
After calling 911, Rizek said she filed a report with the Harvard University Police Department that night. She said she filed another report about the incident with the Cambridge Police Department in January because the incident occurred off campus.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick confirmed in an email last week that Rizek filed a report on January 17 regarding an assault and battery incident that reportedly occurred on November 3.
Khan contested Rizek’s account of the November 3 incident in an emailed statement last month.
Khan wrote that after Rizek asked him for his location via text message the evening of November 3, he responded stating that he was at The Sinclair with other people from the HESA general assembly meeting earlier that evening.
He wrote that when Rizek arrived, he asked her to apologize to the other HESA members present for her behavior at that night's meeting, which Khan said had been received as “rude and distracting.”
“She responded that she wouldn't apologize,” Khan wrote. “She then indicated that she would not leave, which was fully her right, but I was uneasy given the tensions created due to the aforementioned experience at the assembly.”
“She screamed at me, I remember she said ‘I am a student, and I can be with you guys,’” Khan added. “At this point, Nor pushed me out of the way and left some scratches on my arm from her nails.”
Khan wrote that Rizek later began arguing with another student, which he said escalated to a “physical altercation.”
He wrote that a stranger stepped between them and the bouncer eventually escorted Rizek out of the venue. He added that none of the other people in the group, including himself, were forced to leave the venue.
Khan wrote that Rizek later repeatedly asked her friend and fellow Extension School student Anna M. Ray to request that Khan testify that the other student hit Rizek first so that Rizek could press charges against the individual.
Ray confirmed Khan’s account in an interview last month and identified the other student as former HESA president Carmen Gardner, who also goes by the name Carmen Hines. Warnick confirmed that Hines also filed a police report about the incident on November 12.
Hines did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“Nor has a great deal of frustration with me for not ‘taking her side’ in this matter,” Khan wrote.
Rizek said she was distressed for several months after the altercation.
“I was traumatized. I just stayed away from campus after that. And that's why I never said anything or press charges because I just wanted to be done,” Rizek said. “I just wanted it all to go away.”
However, after Rizek learned the HESA race had come down to a tie between Khan and Manzo upon reading an email from the school reminding students to vote in the election, she said she recalled the incident.
“I came forward when I saw that Jacob and Dale were tied for presidential candidate. And when I saw that, I just got sick to my stomach,” Rizek said. “Even though the event didn't happen on campus property — and that's why the school stated that they couldn't do anything for me or the situation — I knew that students had to know what had happened.”
Khan repeatedly declined to comment directly on Rizek’s allegations.
“I am very sorry to hear that a fellow student is under duress, particularly as we prepare to enter finals,” Khan wrote in an email.
Division of Continuing Education spokesperson Harry J. Pierre wrote in an email that administrators would not comment on specific matters in respect of student privacy.
“We take any allegation of assault seriously and have a student conduct policy that we expect all students to adhere to,” Pierre wrote.
Those who violate the Extension School’s conduct policy — which expects students to conduct themselves “responsibly, honestly, and with due respect” — may face disciplinary action including withdrawal or suspension.
Soon after Rizek’s post went live, her allegations immediately drew backlash. Several students in the Extension School students’ Facebook group accused her of colluding with Manzo to pull voters from Khan, according to Rizek and Manzo. Rizek said many students accused her of being a “liar” and having ulterior motives.
Both Rizek and Manzo denied knowing each other personally prior to Rizek’s post. Manzo said he does not have enough information to determine what occurred between Khan and Rizek.
“I want to be extremely clear that I presume innocence here because I don't want it to appear that I either think that she lied or think that he's an assaulter,” he said.
Manzo said he first communicated with Rizek when she messaged him on Facebook just before posting about Khan.
“She messaged me through the Facebook Messenger, where I had been fielding lots of messages from people regarding the election platform questions,” he said. “She said I support you based on your platform issues, but even more so because of what Jacob did to me.”
Rizek said Manzo had no prior knowledge that she would publish a post endorsing him.
“He had no idea who I was,” Rizek said. “I had added him on Facebook that day.”
In an April 28 email, Mark Addison — interim assistant director for Student Activities at DCE — asked Manzo to immediately remove Rizek’s post in the Facebook group or risk the elections committee withdrawing his candidacy, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Crimson.
Addison cited an election rule that barring candidates from engaging in “negative campaigning” in his email.
Manzo eventually emailed a statement to Addison on April 30 denying that he knew Rizek personally, suggested she publicly express her grievances against Khan, or had advance notice of that post being published, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Crimson. He also wrote that he was neither a member nor an administrator of the HES Facebook page when the post was published.
When Rizek learned administrators had threatened to remove Manzo from the election, she said she also immediately sent them a statement confirming that Manzo did not know her beforehand and never requested she publish her allegations. She also attached a screenshot of her and Manzo’s first conversation over Facebook Messenger the day she made her post.
Hours after Rizek’s message went live, a moderator eventually deleted her post and removed her from the group, preventing her from viewing and publishing content on the page.
Asked to comment on Addison and Manzo’s correspondence, Pierre, the DCE spokesperson, wrote in an email that the school would not comment on “supposed private” conversations between a staff member and a student.
“DCE does not have any control over student-created websites and therefore would not be able to edit or control the content,” Pierre also wrote.
Some students involved with the election expressed disdain at the Division of Continuing Education’s role within the HESA election process as a whole.
A HESA executive board member said DCE officials instructed the board to direct media inquiries to Pierre. The board member spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to speak to The Crimson.
“I heard from Mark that there was someone from The Crimson writing a story. I emailed Mark to be sure: what are the conditions or limitations that we have to talk to The Crimson?” the board member said.
“He only said, literally, ‘Refer everyone to Harry from the media department,’” the student added.
The board member said many others on the HESA executive board shared a sense of frustration with the administration and elections proceedings.
“Every single board meeting that we've had, it was kind of discouraging to hear the new things, the new events — but not only the election, pretty much our whole process,” the board member said.
Manzo said he believes the controversies over the HESA election unfairly distracted from Rizek’s allegations.
“I always thought that the Harvard community was better than that,” Manzo said. “That at least if a woman came forward — though I would actually discourage you from all of a sudden wanting to crucify the guy accused — we wouldn’t silence her.”
“The bigger story here is not the HESA election,” he said. “It's on how we treated a woman coming forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard pledged to transition its endowment to carbon-neutral by 2050, fossil fuel divestment activists wrote a letter to University administrators Wednesday urging them to take “drastic climate action.”
In a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee ’72, and members of the Corporation, student, alumni, and faculty groups who favor fossil fuel divestment called on Harvard to divest by 2021 and to adopt more transparent investment policies.
The letter, which was signed by Divest Harvard, Harvard Forward, Harvard Alumni for Divestment, and Ad Hoc Committee on Harvard Divestment, was endorsed by Harvard Faculty for Divestment and Harvard Medical School Faculty for Divestment.
The groups called on the University to divest from all direct holdings of fossil fuel investments by June 2021 and all external holdings by 2025.
“Commit now to full divestment of direct and co-mingled holdings in the fossil fuel industry,” the letter reads. “Ensure that divestment of assets under Harvard’s direct control is carried out as soon as possible, and by June 2021 at the very latest, and that all external investment managers and consultants comply as soon as possible, and by 2025 at the very latest.”
Asked for comment on the demands, University Spokesperson Jason A. Newton referred to Bacow’s original letter to faculty announcing the school’s commitment.
“As noted, the strategy we plan to pursue focuses on reducing the demand for fossil fuels, not just the supply, an action consistent with the University’s overall commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our operations,” Bacow wrote at the time.
The signatories wrote that Harvard’s carbon-neutral pledge “failed to represent the overwhelming majority of the student body, along with thousands of alumni and faculty members. "Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted overwhelmingly in favor of divestment in February; days later, Harvard Medical School professors also passed a resolution urging the University to divest.
The letter also calls on Harvard to disclose “the scope of Harvard’s fossil fuel investments,” and its holdings’ “carbon footprint,” on a regular basis.
“Commit now to interim goals that include reducing the endowment’s carbon emissions by at least 45 percent by 2030 as compared to 2010 levels,” the letter states. “This should account for all emissions — from resource extraction to end use — involved with Harvard’s indirect and direct investments.”
The letter states that Harvard should not include carbon offsets in its calculation of carbon neutrality. It also calls for a more transparent selection process for students, faculty, and alumni who sit on the Presidential Committee on Sustainability and Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility.
Harvard Forward, an alumni organization advocating for the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry, has previously campaigned for increased transparency in the University's governance board elections. The campaign has put forward five candidates for the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body.
The signatories also demand that the University “stop hiding the imprint of the fossil fuel industry on Harvard’s campus.” They wrote that faculty should be required to disclose research and event funding and professional ties to the fossil fuel industry.
The letter calls on Harvard to be a leader in clean investment.
“Seek out and take advantage of investment opportunities that support a rapid and just transition to a clean energy economy,” the letter reads.

Establishing a good morning routine can be a helpful way to combat the languor of our shelter-in-place days. Plus, maybe seeing the sunrise one day instead of waking up past noon will remind you how beautiful the world can be. Getting out of bed is hard, though, so here are a few ways to rip off the band-aid, eat the frog, and leap out of bed:
Go To Bed Early The Night Before
We know you’ve been up late solely to look up memes or see if your ex texted you back. It’s not worth it; just go to sleep. Even better if you can stay off your phone late at night — the blue light isn’t good for your Circadian rhythm.
Or... Don’t Go to Bed at All 
Here’s a philosophical question to keep those eyes open wide: Is it really waking up if you never went to bed? (Hey, at least you’re thinking of this from the comfort of your home instead of Lamont.)
Use an Annoying, Persistent Alarm
If we were on campus, this would be the Mem Church Bells letting you know you’re late to your 9 a.m., or the Lowell Bells jolting you awake every Sunday at the early hour of 1 p.m. For an at-home alternative, you could try chasing this alarm clock around your room instead.
Pretend You Still Have Your 9 a.m.
Imagine your strictest professor glaring at you, or that your attendance is absolutely crucial. If you can convince yourself that you’re a freshman all excited for their first ever Shopping Week 9 a.m. again, you’ll be able to wake up.
Shock Your System
Try going for a run in the morning, even if it’s just around the block. (No one expects you to run the 5k you were capable of pre-quarantine.) Alternatively, check out this Flyby article about the benefits of trying cold showers (#shamelessplug).
Make a List of Your Goals
I don’t mean your five-year plan. Literally, try to think about the reasons you signed up for this class. Maybe you actually liked organic chemistry in high school, needed to fulfill that Gen Ed requirement, or just don’t want to hate yourself tomorrow. Life is more complicated that the idealist college essay you wrote to get in here, and that’s okay.
Take solace in the fact that in a matter of two weeks or less, the semester will be over. It’s the final push, and a hastily written paper or an average final is better than not doing it. Though the trauma of Spring 2020 will probably remain, at least you will have nothing to do soon but think about it while blissfully doing nothing.

Dear freshmen: An online housing day doesn’t mean you can’t make fun of the annual housing day videos. Want a better housing day video? Spend quarantine learning how to video edit and songwrite! In all seriousness though, your upperclassmen houses are very excited to host you in your new home. Without further introduction, here are the rankings for the 2020 housing day videos.
1) Cabot
Cabot brought the heat this year with larger crowds, a witty rap, and lively video editing. It’s similar to the Adam’s house one from last year — meaning that it’s filled with smooth transitions and colorful illustrations — but there are some notable differences like an energetic dance sequence towards the end. With a cameo featuring Dean Khurana, this Housing Day video is sure to make all the residents proud and freshmen excited!
Rate: 5/5
2) Lowell
Lowell has a fun, energetic, and woman-centric Housing Day video that’s undeniably full of pep and confidence. With an original song and enough blue outfits for a century, Lowell is strong competition with their cool and confident crowds. Plus, let’s face it — most of us miss those Lowell bells that once rung so proudly at school.
Rate: 4.9/5
3) Adams
Adams again makes an impressive video using a flowing and unique rap. With a clever integration of the theme song from “The Addams Family,” the video is nothing short of smooth and confident. There’s even a switch in style towards the end as they feature a Rihanna-esque tune and stylish outfits.
Rate: 4.8/5
4) Currier
Currier started strong with a cute video game intro as they went into proving that they’re a birch, a boss, and that their housing rocks. The song is admirably catchy and sassy and we get to see a variety of locations from all around the house. Filled with BGLTQ+ pride, dancing, clever lines, and a digital Bill Gates, Currier’s video is undeniably full of spirit.
Rate: 4.7/5
5) Leverett
Leverett did an admirable cover of Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” and its corresponding music video. Whether the three central bunnies are scooting down a bridge, hanging on a gate, or simply having fun at Stein, it’s easy to agree that Leverett made a light-hearted and silly video. They funnily admitted they were “alright” but also had no problem flexing. Plus, the last scene is a must-see recreation of Eilish's music video.
Rate: 4.6/5
6) Pforzheimer
Pforzheimer shook things up with a mashup of various popular songs, using everything from “Low” by Flo Rida and T-Pain to “Can't Hold Us” by Macklemore. It includes some very aesthetic scenes, which shows off their eccentric and neon arcade. Who wouldn't want to spend a few afternoons there? Extra points for the “Hotline Bling” scene that featured a dramatic montage of everyone’s faces.
Rate: 4.5/5
7) Winthrop 
Whether we’re seeing a lion costume emerge from a dollar bill, a saturated sky, or strong neon lights, the video editing is vibrant and memorable. Winthop comes in strong with clever verses and a speaking interlude, and amusingly tells Lowell, “We been renovated man, get with the times.” Plus, that scene with the sun clock and staircase was gorgeous.
Rate: 4.5/5
8) Mather
Mather came in strong with a laid-back but smooth beat. They also feature a switch-up as they go from a slow ballad to an easy but fun tune. The party scenes look genuinely fun and high-spirited, and the blurry/kaleidoscopic effects are funny. Extra points to the person who managed to sit on a basketball hoop, and for that Spongebob cartoon of a roach.
Rate: 4.4/5
9) Kirkland 
With a flower-filled and sunny video, Kirkland makes their mark with a Lizzo tune that everyone loves. Their video is energetic and features all the signs of a happy House, like fun photo booth scenes, a classy Senior Common Room, and even a resident dean. It also features the obligatory Kirkland dogs, which makes it all the more cheerful.
Rate: 4.3/5
10) Dunster
Dunster uses elegant lighting, Lizzo’s gym moves, and gorgeous House shots to make their point. We’re supposed to “blame it on their moose” if we ever feel jealous, which is easy to do with all the food shots they have of their grille and dining hall. Extra points for impressive flips and moose selfies.
Rate: 4.3/5
11) Eliot
Eliot brings classy outfits and sunglasses as they rightly sing about a few Eliot commodities like a giant HoCo budget, backdoor swipe, and beautiful river views. Since everyone’s a little jealous of Fête, they even threw in a few pictures of their famous formal for everyone to see. One spacious dining hall and many sunglasses later, Eliot goes to lengths to show off.
Rate: 4.2/5
12) Quincy
Quincy’s video felt a little disorganized, but had a unique idea as they started with a prank and slowly transitioned to a song. You can’t go wrong with “Old Town Road” — or rather, “Old Town Rhodes” — so you know that it’s now stuck in everyone’s head. The Rhodes Scholar headline is definitely a flex, but maybe they could’ve integrated that more in the video? Extra points for unlimited penguin costumes.
Rate: 4/5
All in all, every housing day video did a great job of showing off their house and the spirited students within it. We saw more mashups and style switches than before, and everyone’s excited to see what the moves are for next year. “Tiger King” parodies? Zoom the musical? Guess we’ll have to wait and see!
