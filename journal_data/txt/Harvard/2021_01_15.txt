After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Based on Kemp Powers' stage play of the same name, Regina King’s directorial debut “One Night in Miami…” is a thoughtful (if conventionally plotted) thesis on power and civil rights in America. While it’s high-minded and dialogue-driven, King’s film never loses steam because it’s propelled by an intelligent script, deft direction, and a strong ensemble cast.
Set against the backdrop of the 1960s civil rights movement, “One Night in Miami…” follows a fictionalized meeting of four old friends: heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali, activist leader Malcolm X, soul singer Sam Cooke, and NFL player Jim Brown. While they initially gather to party and celebrate Ali winning the world championship, Malcolm X soon unveils his plans for a much deeper agenda. He engages his companions with a discussion on how Black artists and athletes — with relatively newfound power — can enact political change.
While the film steers audiences through a myriad of nuances in that discussion, Powers (who also adapted the film’s screenplay) siphons the complex debate into one overarching question: Should Black activists work within the white capitalist system, or fight it from the outside? This is most prominent when Malcolm X accuses Cooke of pandering his apolitical content to white audiences so he can line his own pockets, instead of producing music that overtly fights for civil rights: “You will never be loved by the people you’re trying so hard to win over. Never. You’re just a wind-up toy in a music box.” In contrast, Cooke argues that by working within the system, he can use his money to usher other Black artists into prominence.
Powers’ screenplay effectively balances each member of the ensemble — not just in screen time, but also in narrative weight. As iconic as these characters are in real life, and considering how ideological their dialogue is, it’s remarkable that these portrayals never feel like caricatures or mouthpieces. Each has his own fears, their own dreams, and their own insecurities — details which Powers builds to create comprehensive character arcs. What’s incredible is that Powers manages to construct multiple stories within a story, all framed with a larger thematic message in mind.
Thankfully, “One Night in Miami…” doesn’t succumb to common pitfalls other stage-to-screen adaptations suffer. Theater is designed for a static observer, and uses limited locations to keep audiences focused on stage. But in film, a static camera removes audiences from the action — a unique problem for “One Night in Miami…” which largely unfolds in a cramped motel room. Given the spatial constraints, it's remarkable that King and cinematographer Tami Reiker were able not just to keep the film moving, but embrace visual nuance with creative shot composition. For instance, King makes gorgeous use of mirrors to make sure characters are always in frame. When characters panic, Reiker’s camera movement mimics that mood; in a scene where Malcolm X searches frantically for hidden bugs, it was surprising to see a handheld tracking shot from a camera that somehow managed to careen around the diminutive motel room.
Another pillar of he film's success is its powerful ensemble cast, led by Kingsley Ben-Adir as Malcolm X and Leslie Odom Jr. as Sam Cooke — both of whom are electric in the film’s climax. However, it’s not always smooth sailing in the acting department. The first act celebration feels uncomfortable and bumpy. Perhaps the biggest perpetrator is Eli Goree, who plays Muhammad Ali: He imbues the film with over the top charisma, but often comes off as unnatural and staged.
In the wake of calls for racial equality and political unrest in the United States, “One Night in Miami” is undoubtedly timely and important. But it should also be celebrated as an achievement in filmmaking in a year where such films have proven scarce. Look for “One Night in Miami…” to pick up serious awards consideration, including possible nominations for Best Director (Regina King), Best Adapted Screenplay (Kemp Powers), and some acting nods. King’s film is currently screening in select theaters in Cambridge, and is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video on January 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard-affiliated hospitals began vaccinating health care workers against Covid-19 in December as hospitals across the country race to shield workers from the infectious disease.
The Mass General Brigham hospital network had administered 39,309 first doses and 4,602 second doses as of Tuesday, and as of Wednesday, Boston Children’s Hospital had administered 7,606 first doses and 2,306 second doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to its employees, according to hospital administrators.
Still, Harvard hospitals’ initial vaccine distribution yielded several issues, including a vaccine sign-up website that crashed and complaints from employees that hospital administrations did not prioritize workers most exposed to Covid-19 to receive the vaccine.
Similar to guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Massachusetts divided its vaccine distribution timeline into phases, prioritizing patient-facing healthcare workers who are at high risk of exposure to Covid-19 in phase one, followed by residents and staff at long-term care facilities, first responders, and medical workers who do not treat Covid-19 patients.
Massachusetts’ largest healthcare provider, Mass General Brigham, experienced issues with its vaccination program beginning the day before workers were eligible to sign up. On Dec. 16, the enrollment app crashed. The next day, available slots were booked within minutes of the website going live at 3 p.m.
Mass General Brigham nurse Jennifer M. DeVincent, who works in the neonatal intensive care unit, said she was caring for a baby at the time the website opened for sign ups and was thus unable to secure an appointment.
DeVincent said she comes into contact with mothers who have contracted the coronavirus and was initially excited about the prospect of getting vaccinated. She soon grew frustrated with the hospital’s vaccine rollout, however, as she felt it did not prioritize frontline workers.
“People got angry whenever we started hearing who got the vaccine, and who didn’t,” she said. “There [were] doctors and nurses and respiratory therapists that work in the emergency room and in the Covid ICU that weren’t able to get appointments, but people who don’t do direct patient care did.”
Katie E. Murphy, a charge nurse who works night shifts in the special pathogens unit at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, also said she faced challenges scheduling a vaccination appointment despite working in an intensive care unit for coronavirus-infected patients.
The first shipment of Pfizer vaccine doses Brigham and Women’s received on Dec. 17 were all used by the end of that day, according to Murphy, who said she was not able to book a vaccine appointment until her third attempt.
Murphy likened the process of trying to schedule a vaccination appointment to buying concert tickets.
“It reminds me of getting Rolling Stones tickets on the phone years ago — you waited until they went on sale and quickly got on the phone and started re-dialing,” she said.
Since the first round of signups, both DeVincent and Murphy said they have received the first dosage of the vaccine and have booked appointments for the second dose.
DeVincent said she believes most frontline medical workers at the hospital have since been able to secure vaccination appointments, adding that she appreciated that the hospital acknowledged and resolved initial problems.
Paul D. Biddinger, director of emergency preparedness at Mass General Brigham, said he attributes improvements to the hospital’s vaccination program to an increased supply of vaccines and better management of staff expectations.
“The biggest challenge for us was at the very beginning, where the initial allocation that we received from the state was not enough to cover what we call Wave A, which is our emergency departments, intensive care units, inpatient areas caring for Covid patients,” Biddinger said. “We didn’t message the fact that we would have to subdivide Wave A.”
Biddinger said vaccine distribution is challenging because hospitals do not know in advance how many vaccines they will receive from the state in each shipment. The state receives the vaccines from the federal government, which has faced its own problems with distribution.
Mass Gen Brigham, which has 81,000 employees, is currently ahead of its original vaccination goal, per Biddinger. The hospital had scheduled vaccines for at least 75 percent of eligible workers as of Jan. 6. Biddinger said he believes the hospital will begin to vaccinate high-risk patients as part of Phase Two as soon as February.
At Boston Children’s Hospital, hospital epidemiologist Thomas J. Sandora said he witnessed no issues regarding vaccine distribution. The hospital established teams to oversee its coronavirus vaccination program, including one group that categorized workers based on their exposure risk.
Boston Children’s Hospital pediatrician Aaron Bernstein and nurse practitioner Keri Sullivan agreed the vaccine rollout has gone smoothly. Though he was not in the first priority group, Bernstein said he received two doses of the vaccine earlier this month.
As the majority of Americans remain ineligible to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, elite hospitals, including Harvard’s, have come under scrutiny for inoculating medical staff who are not patient-facing, raising ethical questions, which surfaced in a recent report by The New York Times.
Biddinger explained that Mass General Brigham included researchers in its initial vaccine rollout because they are involved in the hospital’s staffing plans in response to a surge in Covid-19 cases. He said researchers are redeployed to ICUs to help nurses and doctors monitor patients.
Mass General Brigham will vaccinate any Harvard medical student working clinically in eligible areas, including ICUs and ambulatory clinics, Biddinger added.
Biddinger, who also chairs Massachusetts’ Covid-19 vaccine advisory group, which counsels the state on vaccine distribution, emphasized that the order of who gets vaccinated first does not suggest the state values some lives more than others. Instead, he said, the order is intended to maximize the number of lives saved from the virus.
“The advisory group, and I think probably everybody involved in this effort in general, wants to vaccinate as many people as quickly as they possibly can,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 30 Harvard workers and supporters called for contracted employees idled by the pandemic to receive paid leave in the spring during a rally in Harvard Yard Thursday.
32BJ Service Employees International Union, the union representing approximately 1,000 Harvard custodians and security guards, and Local 26, the local chapter of UNITE HERE that represents Harvard dining workers, organized the rally.
The rally occurred one day before some contracted workers at the University will become ineligible to receive emergency pay if their jobs are suspended due to the pandemic, while idled workers who are directly employed by the University will receive up to 70 percent of their pay.
From mid-March 2020 through Jan. 15, all idled workers — contracted and directly employed — received full pay and benefits under Harvard’s emergency excused absence policy.
Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement, among other student organizations, helped galvanize supporters and publicize the rally. It circulated a petition that has received more than 1,100 signatures from Harvard affiliates demanding the University extend the emergency excused absence policy.
The Labor and Employment Action Project — a student advocacy group at Harvard Law School — and other student groups also sponsored a petition calling on the Law School to “keep with its mission of advancing justice and well-being” by paying its idled contracted dining workers. LEAP also hosted a call-in event Thursday, encouraging supporters to call Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82.
Individual schools will decide whether to continue paying idled contracted employees, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement.
“As the various Schools and Units at Harvard have moved forward with their planning for the spring semester, they will notify contractors if they intend to continue to contract for services that may still be idled due to the pandemic,” Newton wrote.
The Business School and the Graduate School of Education have already agreed to extend the 70 percent paid leave policy to all their idled workers, according to Roxana L. Rivera, vice president of 32BJ.
“At this point, we’d like Harvard to make the decision to include contracted workers, but short of that we impress upon each of the schools to be willing to follow the example of the Business School and the Graduate School of Education,” Rivera said in an interview at the rally.
Many union members and their allies have two broad justifications for extending the policy’s coverage: the University’s financial resources and a moral duty to workers and the communities they live in.
Rivera pointed out that the University’s endowment has risen to $41.9 billion despite the pandemic.
“Now that we have a vaccine in sight, we’re asking Harvard to just hold on and help these workers into the spring semester,” she said.
Law School chef Eugene Van Buren, a contracted employee who attended the rally, said that he may be laid off despite having worked at the Law School dining hall for nine years. Van Buren is a chief shop steward and serves on the executive board of Local 26.
“I have a daughter,” he said. “She’s a senior. She’s in her senior year in college and my son’s going into high school next year. This is paramount for me.”
Van Buren added that contracted workers are essential to Harvard and its students, noting that “we’re the people that supply that experience.”
Kennedy School lecturer Richard Parker, who also attended the rally, called extending the paid leave policy “the right thing to do” given Harvard’s relative financial stability during the pandemic. Parker said that students and faculty should “take leadership” from unions and their representatives.
“Let their leaders tell us what we can do to help,” he said. “Many of us are prepared to act right now.”
In addition to the ongoing economic crisis, Rivera also noted that it is important to recognize the racial aspect of who is most at risk of losing their pay and benefits, especially with Martin Luther King Jr. Day coming up on Monday.
“They come from some of the hardest hit communities — and we’re talking about East Boston, Dorchester, Mattapan, Brockton, Everett, and Chelsea that have had the highest rates of COVID, that have seen the highest unemployment rate,” she said. “They are Black and Brown communities.”
At the rally, organizers with megaphones quoted King, saying, “‘The time is always right to do what is right.’”
32BJ spokesperson Amanda Torres-Price wrote in an email that organizers and workers expect Harvard’s individual schools to announce their plans for contracted workers and layoffs more broadly in the coming days.
