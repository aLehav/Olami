After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Valentine's Day is almost here, so let's remember some of the weirdest couples to have ever graced a book, a play, or our Netflix screens.
5. “Twilight”: Edward and Bella: It’s cute when a guy looks over at a sleeping girl and smiles. It’s not cute when he does this every minute of every night. If that doesn’t bother you, just remember that it isn’t necessarily her beauty or personality that draws him to her. It’s the scent of her blood. For some reason, this isn’t a red flag for her.
4. “Arrested Development”: Lindsay and Tobias Fünke: Two people could not be more different. Also, Tobias’ condition as a “never-nude” (yes, it means just what it sounds like) seems to keep them from becoming closer. Fights break out often between these two extremely impulsive characters. Tobias tries, and fails to be an analrapist (both an analyst and therapist, but you can see why it didn’t take off) while Lindsay attempts to champion causes just to prove something to her family. This is not exactly a “healthy relationship.
3. “Oedipus Rex”: Oedipus and his mother, Jocasta: You can’t talk about the weirdest couples in art without mentioning the original motherlover himself. Guys are always so nervous that they’ll end up marrying their mother, but Oedipus is literally told that he will. Does that stop him from doing it? No. Is he surprised when he finally figures it out? Absolutely.
2. “The Office”: Angela Martin and Dwight Schrute: From secret rendezvous in the warehouse to countless awkward moments in front of coworkers, Angela and Dwight are one of the weirdest couples on TV. As odd as they are, they do have one thing in common: no sane person would want to be with them. It all works out though, just as long as Dwight will allow cats on their beet farm.
1. “Game of Thrones”: Jaime and Cersei Lannister: It’s almost universally agreed that incest is weird. But incest is even weirder when it’s with your twin. As a knight, Jaime can pretty much have any lady in the land, yet he chooses his sister. On top of it all, this relationship has the potential to send the entire realm into complete chaos. What else would you expect from the Lannister family though?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At last Tuesday’s faculty meeting, Dean of Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser presented on the current composition of the faculty, focusing particularly on trends in the hiring of women and minorities. Given recent comments by administrators surrounding female and minority faculty, it is evident that there is still much that can be done to improve faculty diversity. Having a faculty that reflects Harvard’s increasingly diverse student body is critical, but unfortunately Harvard could be losing numerous qualified minorities due to the current hiring and tenure process. The loss of talented female applicants and applicants of color is an urgent issue to which more attention must be paid.
Zipser noted that while more women were hired this year than last, there are still additional factors that make it more difficult for women to thrive in an academic environment. These include a lack of mentorship and increased pressure to serve on committees. Given that female junior faculty leave at higher rates than their male counterparts, there is still much to be done to ensure the faculty better approaches gender parity.
In addition, Zipser described a plateau in the hiring of minorities, including underrepresented minorities. That is a deeply troubling trend. Minority faculty members already can feel that they must work harder to have their scholarship taken seriously because they are the only racial minority in their department, underscoring the importance of finding more scholars of color.
While Harvard should prioritize excellence in offering jobs, it must make the process of tenure transparent to all applicants. In the past decade, there have been clear indications that this process, while inherently difficult, is also riddled with latent biases and allegations of discrimination. Before 2003, there was no defined tenure track at all, and a  lack of clarity still surrounds the process. Steps like the ad hoc committee meeting are described as “greatly shrouded in mystery” with “remarkably little [being] written about it,” keeping the process from being fully open. These challenges make it harder for minority professors to invest in the tenure track.
This issue is not an unimportant one. Lack of faculty diversity leaves minority students without a sufficient number of mentors who can relate to them. Faculty of color also tend to fall into roles supporting those students of color, even though that labor can overwork those faculty without necessarily leading to rewards in the tenure process.
We recognize the inherent obstacles to a broader range of professors—of Ph.D. holders, only 5.9 percent identify as African-American and 5.4 percent identify as Hispanic—and that the challenge of faculty diversity begins at the undergraduate level. But this just heightens the importance of getting the tenure process right for the relatively few minority and female junior faculty that are already here. At the end of the day, Harvard can do more to draw back the curtain, and in so doing, hopefully level the playing field for all scholars, regardless of gender or race.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: I do my own laundry. It’s tempting to pay HSA to do it for me, but it’s an expense I can’t justify to myself. In one of my first weeks in Leverett, as I was bringing two weeks’ worth of dirty clothes to the laundry room, I heard a surprisingly familiar Spanish drawl. It carried the way my abuelita’s words carried through her adobe house in rural El Salvador. It sounded like my tios and tias gossiping around a table at one of countless family cookouts, their words finding a rhythm with the sizzling of pupusas cooking in the background. In my dorm that day, thousands of miles from home and even further from El Salvador, the words came from a conversation between a cleaning lady and a maintenance man. Their Spanish was distinctly Salvadoran.
Zoe: Sometimes, I feel lost. It’s as though I’m on this impossible quest attempting to find something that reminds me of home. I’m constantly seeking out the hints of color in the otherwise blinding sea of white, because when the cold sets in and I’m reminded of how far away I am from home, I just want the comfort that comes from those moments of familiarity. I was walking out of a section for my Social Studies class when beautiful, lilting Spanish words immediately transported me to images of the paleta man coming down the street, hardworking brown bodies, and food so spicy that water can never be very far away. I turned the corner and found the source in two of Mather’s Latinx custodial workers joking and laughing with each other. The familiar sounds of rolled r’s and rapid-fire words fell from their lips, providing me with a warmth I fail to find in predominantly white syllabi and classrooms where the moments I find a face that looks like my own are few and far between.
R: I saw myself and my family reflected in them. And this wasn’t the first time I’d found myself reflected in my university’s labor force. Many of the Harvard University Dining Services staff are brown and black people, and, in their accented English, it isn’t too difficult to hear my father and mother when they first moved to the United States. When the HUDS workers went on strike last fall, I joined the picket lines and demonstrations not only because healthcare and living wages are human rights, but because they are rights I wanted for those who feel like family. Chanting with HUDS felt like Sunday morning sermons, and, in rallying with them, I felt amongst family again. University administrators try to create a sense of home for incoming students, but exchanging hellos with the labor staff feels more like home than most classrooms and student organizations.
Z: Home is a place filled with people of color, inside of Houston where the signs and advertisements are just as likely to be in Spanish as English. It is the joy I felt when I was wearing my Harvard Latina shirt and one of Mather’s HUDS workers pointed at it and told me she loved it, because she was a Latina, too, a Dominicana, and proceeded to make me feel as comfortable as she could. Yet the reminder that my roots are in stark contrast to those of the majority of Harvard students came in the form of conversations centered around the strike, when a girl told me that she just couldn’t quite understand why the HUDS workers were striking. Didn’t they know, she proclaimed, “that certain jobs just make certain wages?” I felt sick. Her words haunted me as I yelled “Harvard, escucha, estamos en la lucha,” as I became a part of the we, a we dominated by faces with skin painted a color so similar to my own, nuestra comunidad.
R: And when people disrespect labor staff, by leaving their trays in the dining hall or not cleaning up their puke after a night out because they know a brown body will come in the morning to clean, it feels painfully personal. When people opposed the strike on principle, failing to see the HUDS staff’s humanity, it felt like a denial of my own humanity. When my peers ignore labor staff, it feels like they could just as easily ignore me in the classroom. And given that in 2014, only 14 percent of FAS executive, administrative, and managerial jobs went to minorities—compared to 61 percent of maintenance and service jobs—it makes sense that students would associate brown skin with nothing but labor. It’s a narrative fed to us by movies and television shows, and the vast underrepresentation of Latinx individuals in most major professional careers. Fixing the issues of misrepresentation and underrepresentation benefits all Latinx individuals, regardless of the socioeconomic background from which they come.
Z: We were fighting. Fighting a Harvard, a world, that said that we deserved to make “certain wages” because we were in those “certain jobs.” I wondered if that girl would have sung a different tune if she could see her community reflected in the brown hands roughened from serving the privileged students at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. If she could see her roots reflected in the eyes of people who were in some way the products of a hope for a better life, only to be forced to fight for the basic right to affordable healthcare and more than just the “certain wage” that the privileged have deemed nuestra communidad worthy of receiving.
R+Z: Disrespect towards staff members, or disregard for their livelihood, shouldn’t be tolerated, regardless. Compounded on the way that we relate and hear ourselves in the Spanish staff speak, it becomes an attack on your peers as well. We constantly claim to strive for a campus community that is inclusive of all, regardless of ethnicity or background, but until we start acknowledging labor staff as part of that community, students of color will continue to struggle to feel fully included.

“You’re so lucky. I can’t get any financial aid.”
My friend expressed her jealousy in a way that I didn’t understand―Lucky? For what? Because my parents couldn’t afford to pay for college like hers could? I expected her to grab my glasses next and tell me how jealous she was that she couldn’t have her own pair on account of her perfect sight.
My friend and I grew up in two different worlds. Harvard recognized this but decided to give me a chance anyway―diagnosing me as “low-income” and prescribing me with financial aid. With this financial aid, I assumed I was somehow cured of this disadvantage. It wasn’t until later that I realized I was just receiving something to make life more bearable.
Growing up, my family and I lived in a small apartment in Connecticut. We’d rarely eat out or go on vacation. I happily accepted my sister’s hand-me-downs and would hold my mother’s hand as she pulled us towards the clearance aisle at Old Navy or Kohl’s. I explored colorful bookshelves as we waited for appointments at the clinic that could treat us without health insurance. I ate burgers and fries from the McDonald’s dollar menu when my parents got home too late to make dinner.
My siblings and I knew not to demand too much because we couldn’t have all the things that we wanted. Our family got by, but our future was always up in the air. We therefore looked for a cure in education: My parents pushed my siblings and me to work hard so that someday this disease would release its hold on us.
Their push ended up paying off. Feelings of fulfillment rushed through my body and escaped in the form of tears as I read the word “Congratulations” on my laptop screen. I was left speechless as I thought about what this opportunity would mean for my family. My mom hugged me as I cried tears of joy but waited no longer than five minutes before asking when I would receive the financial aid package. Money was the deciding factor. We couldn’t afford to be happy yet.
I wasn’t able to commit to Harvard until I was notified that not only had I gotten in, but also that I was going for free. I rejoiced in the news that Harvard would provide me with health insurance, a startup grant, and even a winter coat fund.
For the first time in my life, I can present my health insurance card when asked for it. I can pay for books, and even enjoy occasional dinners with friends. I can return home with long-deserved Christmas presents for my family and stories of how my first semester went. I share these stories with my parents of how much my life has changed for the better, but am met with the same stories of hardship I left behind six months ago.
While I buy blazers for business formal meetings at Harvard, my dad buys white t-shirts and matching painters’ pants, a uniform that is rendered useless for several months when winter comes and work doesn’t. My mom buys boots and thick socks to protect herself from the snow that hits unforgivingly as she walks to the bus stop to get to work. I find out that my dad pulled his shoulder at work and is still in pain. My mom shares her worries as she wonders how they will pay for the next month’s rent. I feel guilty and helpless. As I enjoy everything Harvard gives me, my parents continue to struggle.
Although Harvard has provided me with so much, it has not changed the fact that I continue to test positive for poverty. Harvard uses its financial aid blanket to try to stop us from seeing it, but we can’t be cured so easily. We continue to struggle to keep up. We continue to check the price tag first before buying anything. We continue to call back home to hear about the same struggles that plague our families.
And we continue to strive to use our education as a cure to poverty the way our parents wanted. But it’s hard to focus on our classes when this disease gnaws on our brains.

Valentine’s Day has me thinking about love and lace. Love, because now is the time to declare it. And lace, because according to one magazine's “Fashion Girls” (what?), it should be a part of my love-declaring outfit.
It’s hard to miss the pattern: articles that give advice on what to wear for Valentine’s Day say that lace—on a dress, in a coat, as a skirt, or randomly in the middle of your legs—is the way to look irresistible. And I’m just sitting here in Dunster House’s dining hall wondering why.
The thing is, I think that each passing generation finds lace less and less sexy. I don’t mean to play dumb. I know, I know. Underwear is made of lace, and underwear is sexy. The Victoria’s Secret fashion show didn’t draw 6.7 million live viewers last year because the models wore confusingly large angel wings. It’s because there’s a lot of lace and not much else. Sex sells.
But, in my defense, the Victoria’s Secret fashion show has been losing viewers each year since 2012, and one of the hottest trends of 2016 was those Calvin Klein “logo” underwear that look like men’s briefs. No lace in sight.
Kylie Jenner’s Instagram is like a love-letter to the "logo" underwear—she regularly posts photos of herself in Calvin Kleins or similar briefs. In the most popular of these photos, which garnered over 3 million likes, she and her boyfriend seem to reenact a legendary Calvin Klein ad featuring Mark Wahlberg and Kate Moss. In 1992, when the original ad ran, the image of two mega-hot superstars—one a buff dude, the other a waifish supermodel—lounging in identical Calvin Klein underwear grew sales exponentially. Unisex underwear was undeniably in. Sporty was sexy. Cotton was cool.
Brilliant though she may be, Kylie didn’t spontaneously bring back the Comfortable Unisex Underwear trend. Back in spring 2015, Calvin Klein itself ran an ad campaign that looked unmistakably like the Wahlberg/Moss one. The new photos featured of-the-moment superstars Justin Bieber and Lara Stone, but the effect is identical: A woman and a man are wearing the same underwear, and both of them look sultry.
Briefs are clearly back. This is useful information if you care about being on trend. But more importantly, it might be evidence that we, collectively as Americans, are tired of the lacy, formal, gussied-up definition of what it means to be “sexy” or “appealing” or “attractive.” We’re making it a little more comfortable, or at least a little less delicate. If lace could talk, we’re re-writing what it would say.
This has already happened at least once. Before people wore lace to look sexy, they wore it to look rich. The first samples of lace were hand-woven in Italy the 1400s, centuries before machines existed. Women who wove lace often went blind from the detail-oriented work. It could take two hours to make just one inch of the stuff.
Needless to say, lace was insanely expensive. Only the wealthiest nobles could afford it, and even they sometimes spent their entire fortunes on lace collars and cuffs in order to look rich. By the 1700s, nobles bought lace like today’s one-percent buy vintage sports cars.
Then, suddenly, it all stopped. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, it became incredibly uncool to buy and own luxury goods like lace. By the 1800s, with the Industrial Revolution in full swing, machine-made lace hit the markets and rendered the handmade stuff less valuable. Over time, it became easy and cheap to produce lace that was lightweight, breathable, and easy to wash—perfect for making underwear. The rest is history.
Which brings me to the present: I see Americans rethinking the meaning of lace once more. If Kylie Jenner fell right into Calvin Klein’s marketing trap, she’s just one of many gullible consumers to jump on the boy-briefs bandwagon. At Bloomingdale's, the underwear are a top seller. Urban Outfitters now carries Calvin Klein in their stores, American Apparel made their own version, and even high-fashion designer Moschino copied the look and sells it for six times the price.
Instead of creating barely-there, pin-up worthy lingerie, designers like those behind the brand Zimmermann are now layering lace on top of itself to create very voluminous dresses that are anything but revealing. They take elements from underwear design—which would classically be visible only in private—and make them totally obvious so that they’re less sexualized. There’s criss-crossed ribbon that laces up like a corset, but it’s on the outside of the dress, obscuring rather than accentuating its wearer’s chest. It’s just sheer enough to remind us of what we can’t see. All we get for free is this woman’s wrist. If the Victoria’s Secret outfits say “come hither,” Zimmermann’s dress says “I dressed up as a rugged Disney princess today because I wanted to.”
The lacy Zimmermann dress and not-at-all lacy Calvin Klein underwear are two interpretations of the same definition of attractiveness—one that recognizes that benign details are the most intimate. One that wants us to dress for ourselves. If you feel most confident in a dress that kind of looks like a tablecloth, then you’ll look stunning in it.
And by the same token, you don’t need feathers and sparkles and glitter on your underwear to be appealing. Calvin Klein cotton would be much more comfortable under your Zimmermann dress anyway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: February 14, 2017 at 3:20 p.m.
Dozens of protesters assembled in front of Harvard Medical School’s Gordon Hall Saturday called on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to relocate a Feb. 18 fundraiser at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.
Dana-Farber, a Medical School teaching hospital, announced Thursday that it will keep this year’s annual fundraiser at Trump’s Palm Beach resort but vowed to “avoid controversial” venues in the future. In January, thousands of Medical School affiliates signed a petition supporting the relocation of the event after Trump signed an executive order barring immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
Brandishing signs and wearing warm clothes on a chilly afternoon, the protesters cheered on patients, doctors, and students who spoke at the rally. Many discussed their immigrant backgrounds and thoughts on how Trump’s immigration executive order has negatively affected the medical field.
Celeste Royce, a doctor from Dorchester, said some immigrants have been deterred from seeking medical attention due to fear of prosecution after the presidential order. She urged audience members to advocate for vulnerable patients.
“If we do not speak out against the discriminatory policies, then who will?” Royce said.
Senan Ebrahim, a fourth year M.D./Ph.D. student whose mother is a Syrian immigrant, said he was concerned that many patients abroad—including his own grandmother—cannot seek quality medical care in the United States because of the executive order.
“Today, we are complicit in a grave and growing injustice,” Ebrahim said.
In a statement Thursday, top Dana-Farber administrators thanked patients, faculty, and staff for “their respectful and constructive concern,” but wrote that cancelling the fundraiser “would also be seen as a political statement.” Dana-Farber has paid Mar-a-Lago $150,000 every year since 2011 to hold its annual “Discovery Celebration” fundraiser.
“Our decision last year to continue to rent that facility for this long-standing fundraiser was never meant to be, and does not now intend to be, any type of political statement or endorsement of any political figure or policy position,” President of Dana-Farber Laurie H. Glimcher and Board of Trustees Chairman Joshua Bekenstein wrote.
At the protest, student activists challenged Glimcher and Bekenstein’s statement, which Medical School student Omar Bayomy said focused on “appeasement rather than the issues at hand.”
Bayomy said he respects and supports the Dana-Farber Institute and its mission, but challenged the hospital’s statement that the decision to hold the fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago was not intended to be a political endorsement.
“In my opinion, these issues are not political,” Bayomy said. “We are speaking about human life and the respect and dignity we uphold for such life—this is not politics, this is humanity.”
Wearing stethoscopes to indicate their medical backgrounds, student organizers thanked the crowd for braving the cold temperatures.
“We will be cold and be uncomfortable because this matters that much,” said student organizer Colleen M. Farrell to the crowd, which cheered in response.
Several Dana-Farber faculty members made closing remarks and said they were concerned about the Mar-a-Lago controversy.
“When many of us heard about the issue, we thought it would go away,” said Julie-Aurore Losman, a Medical School assistant professor who said many at Dana-Farber were “deeply troubled” by the Mar-a-Lago decision. “We have a moral imperative to not only stand up for our colleagues and families, but our patients.”
Dana B. Sarvey, a Medical School assistant professor who participated in the protest, described herself as “uncomfortable with sitting at home and doing nothing.”
“More physicians need to be involved in healthcare policy,” Sarvey said. “At times in the past, individuals in the medical profession haven’t always spoken up for patient interests for a variety of reasons, but now is the time to speak up. ”
At the conclusion of the event, Farrell encouraged the audience to keep “standing up for all the people in our community.” She described herself as “heartened” and “energized” by the support from not only students, but also faculty members for whom protesting is more “delicate.”  Organizers will schedule a town hall meeting in the near future about the Mar-a-Lago event.
“Thank you and this is just the beginning,” Farrell said to the crowd.

Harvard’s Memorial Church held a festive reception for around 90 students Friday night to celebrate the re-opening of the Church after months of renovations.
In a ceremony punctuated by musical performances and speeches, invited students attended the ribbon cutting and a formal dinner in the new “student oasis,” the 2,500 square foot centerpiece of the revamped basement. The downstairs area also contains two newly designed conference rooms and a kitchen for student use.
“This is an all-student event,” said Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church. “Just like the actual renovation project itself, we wanted to privilege students, so we wanted to start off our first shebang with the student population.”
According to Walton, the Memorial Church renovations focused on improving accessibility for the student body. The refurbished kitchen is now compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and new accessibility ramps run to both entrances of the Church.
“Now, students, everybody in the community, can enter through the same door together,” said Walton.
“We are made for everybody,” Walton added. “Everyone at Harvard may not belong to the Memorial Church, but the Memorial Church belongs to everyone at Harvard.”
Technical improvements to the Church include adding air conditioning as well as a heating and ventilation system. On the first floor of the church, the pews were removed and refurbished and the floors refinished, said Adrienne Yapo, Creative and Communications Lead for Memorial Church.
The bulk of renovations took place in the basement area, which Walton said he hopes will provide a collaborative social space for students. According to Harrison Phelps ‘18, who attended the reopening, the Memorial Church staff envisions the “student oasis” as “an area where students in the larger Harvard student body can get to know each other better.”
“That’s one of the things that Harvard lacks—social spaces,” Phelps said.
The “student oasis” will be open for all students to hold meetings, cook, and study between classes, Walton said. “We are a space of grace at the center of Harvard Yard. We appreciate you as you are, and for that reason we wanted to create a space of radical hospitality,” Walton said.
The grand opening’s theme was “Mem Church Moments,” emphasizing role of students in creating the future of Memorial Church. Evening activities included an interactive photo display and conversations about students’ memories and hopes for the future.
“Mem Church moments are not just about the past, they’re not about tonight, but we are literally writing our future of the Memorial Church, beginning right now,” said Walton.
Several members of student groups that perform, practice, and meet at Memorial Church said its reopening was a welcome change after months of gathering at alternative locations.
“It’s really nice to be back,” said Micah Walter, a graduate student who attended the event. “It’s nice to have a home.”

Facing budget constraints due to an underperforming endowment and dwindling cash reserves, Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences has reduced the number of admissions slots for graduate students this year by 4.4 percent, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
In an interview Friday, Smith said the decrease in admissions is attributable to “the flat endowment distribution that we will see next year and the drying up of some funds that we’ve used in the past to help admit some students.”
In fiscal year 2016, Harvard’s endowment dropped almost $2 billion in value after Harvard Management Company returned negative 2 percent on its investments, prompting concern from University President Drew G. Faust. In November, a report on the University’s finances warned University budgets could be “significantly constrained” for years to come. 
With these constraints in mind, Smith said he must focus on students currently attending the University before potential new students.
“Those [admissions cuts] are painful because there’s some fantastic individuals out there that are trying to come into our graduate school, that we’d love to have a part of our community,” Smith said. “But I also have to be thoughtful about the individuals I already have on campus, making sure that they have as outstanding a student experience as possible.”
Beyond cuts to GSAS admissions, other FAS priorities will also feel pressure of diminished financial resources. The renovation of Lowell House, slated to begin this summer, will in part be funded by debt taken out by FAS, according to Smith. However, Smith said he was confident that the debt funding will not affect the current Lowell renovation timeline.
“We’re definitely going forward on Lowell,” Smith said. “It will be renewed unless the whole world collapses tomorrow.”
This marks the first time in the University’s years-long series of House renewals that a project will be partially funded by debt, though Smith said that FAS had been planning to take out debt for some time.
As other areas of the University’s record-breaking capital campaign have surpassed their goals ahead of the campaign’s scheduled 2018 end, FAS has made a concerted effort to focus on House renewal funding, which has still falls short of its fundraising goal.
FAS has had mixed success securing funding for House renewal. Last year, Winthrop House, which is currently under renovation, renamed a building following a donation of an undisclosed sum by Robert M. Beren ’47. Last year, Smith suggested that FAS may soon allow donors to endow Faculty Dean positions in the House of their choice to raise funds.
“We’re into the projects now that are quite expensive and we’re not getting $100 million dollar gifts. Those are few and far between,” Smith said. “We use some of our reserves in this space and we use some of this endowment. The purpose of having an endowment is being able to use it in times like this.”
Lowell, the fifth house to be renovated as part of FAS’s House renewal project, will be the longest and most complicated renovation thus far. Students are slated to return to a renovated Lowell in the fall of 2019.

Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow sharply rebuked President Donald Trump’s “radically disturbing” criticisms of the federal judiciary in an op-ed published Friday in the Boston Globe.
Minow co-authored the op-ed, called “Standing up for ‘so-called’ law,” with Yale Law School Dean Robert C. Post ’69. The piece condemns Trump’s “attack” on James L. Robart—a federal judge who blocked Trump’s executive order barring refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States—and warns that the president  “may become a tyrant” without the rule of law.
“If Trump believes he can make an enemy of the law and of the Constitution, then he has truly become a foe of the Republic, despite the oath he swore at his inauguration,” Minow and Post wrote.
Trump has signed three immigration-related executive orders since his inauguration, sparking widespread protest and a series of legal challenges across the country. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared Thursday that it would uphold the stay on Trump’s seven-country immigration ban, and the case may reach the Supreme Court.
Minow and Post’s op-ed comes after weeks of resistance and response on campus to Trump’s immigration  orders, and Harvard has bolstered the resources it offers students impacted by them. The Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic has ramped up its activities since the order, hiring a full-time attorney to address students’ immigration-related concerns and helping the University file an amicus brief challenging the order. At least four Harvard affiliates have experienced travel challenges as a result of the orders so far.
In an emailed statement, Minow said Trump’s comments about the law—”The opinion of this so-called judge... is ridiculous and will be overturned!” the president tweeted of Robart’s ruling Feb. 4—prompted her and Post to pen the op-ed.
“Dean Post and I were writing as scholars, lawyers, and teachers, and our roles leading two of the nation’s top law schools compelled us to speak out,” Minow wrote.
In the op-ed, Minow and Post criticize what they characterize as the “pointless confusion and massive heartbreak” caused by Trump’s executive order and the consequences of his attacks on the judiciary. Arguing that Trump views the law as “simply one more enemy to be smashed into submission,” Minow and Post close the op-ed with a call to stand up for the country’s legal institutions.
“It is time for all who care about this nation to worry when the nation’s most powerful office is used to intimidate the institutions of law that have maintained American stability and prosperity since the founding of the Republic,” they wrote. “Trump’s attack on the ‘so-called’ Judge Robart and his ‘ridiculous’ order exposes just how fragile our democracy is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will be “deeply involved” in the faculty committee reconsidering the current policy on final clubs and Greek life, though Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith has not yet determined its membership.
In interviews Friday, both Smith and University President Drew G. Faust said that Khurana will maintain a leadership role in crafting any potential changes to the initial policy.
The committee, which Khurana announced Jan. 25, could “revise or replace” the current policy. Faculty, staff, and students will serve on that committee and submit recommendations to Smith in fall 2017.
Khurana led the effort to craft the initial policy, which, starting with the class of 2021, prohibits members of single-gender social organizations from holding leadership positions in clubs and on sports teams and receiving College endorsement for certain selective fellowships.
The policy has been the subject of controversy among the Faculty. Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 penned a motion opposing the policy, and some professors charged that they were not properly consulted about crafting it. The new faculty committee will now allow professors to have significant input on the sanctions.
Smith said he has not picked a date for the announcement of members of the new committee.
“I hope to get that done as quickly as possible, because as we said in the message, I’d like to get that group working,” he said.
Committee members will come from across FAS, Smith said. Members could include professors on the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest elected body; the Education Policy Committee, headed by Khurana; or committee crafting recommendations about how to implement the initial policy.
Smith also said that professors who had signed the  motion opposing the sanctions could be included in the faculty committee’s work. At last week’s Faculty meeting, Lewis’s motion was officially withdrawn without objection, ending official discussion of the sanctions at Faculty meetings for the foreseeable future.
“I’m looking at this from a point of view where we need a diversity of opinions, if we’re going to have a productive  conversation about what changes the Faculty should consider,” he said.
While the committee will submit its final recommendations to Smith, Smith said he plans to draw upon work the College has already done to inform those recommendations. The policy implementation committee has worked on crafting its recommendations for months, though members were unaware of the formation of the new faculty committee until soon before its announcement.
“I don’t think that we’re starting from ground zero here. I think there’s a lot of information,” Smith said.“The knowledge that we already have from the implementation committee, the knowledge the College has, all the reports we’ve talked about over the fall, all that is going to feed into this process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved a revamped General Education program in March 2016, University President Drew G. Faust hailed it as a “historic moment.” The overhauled program, scheduled to take full effect in fall 2018, will replace a Gen Ed curriculum described in a 2015 FAS report as “failing on a variety of fronts.”
But for students currently attending the College, the gradual move to the new program has been less momentous. Among current juniors and seniors straddling the transition between the old and new Gen Ed programs, the changes have been met with a range of reactions.
The overhauled Gen Ed program will require students to complete classes in four new Gen Ed categories, fulfill a distribution requirement, and take one numerical reasoning-based course. For the Classes of 2017 and 2018, though, the old requirements are still in place—though the selection of classes that count for Gen Ed credit has expanded to allow those students to “benefit from the spirit of the new program,” according to the Gen Ed website.
Over the summer of 2016, the Office of Undergraduate Education retroactively changed some students’ academic records so that courses previously not listed as Gen Ed courses now fulfilled requirements.
Daniel V. Banks ’17, a former Undergraduate Council Vice President, said the change penalizes students who fulfilled their Gen Ed requirements before the change.
“They reward people who did not do their requirements earlier on in their college career,” Banks said. “I would have had a few more classes at Harvard that were actually important to me and educationally fulfilling, and instead I was retroactively told that what I did two years ago was a waste of time.”
Others, including Liz Kantor ’18, said their records had not changed under the new system.
“Before the transition, I had six Gen Eds and I have two left to do, so it hasn’t really affected me at all, “ Kantor said. “Obviously, I want to take fewer Gen Eds,” she added.
Mary Jiang ’17 also said the Gen Ed changes had not impacted her academic record, and said she hoped students would continue to take classes outside of their comfort zones under the new program.
“I’m guessing the administration wants to make it more flexible students for students. I really hope that doesn’t come at the cost of students not being required to confront classes they have wanted to take before,” Jiang said.
Sean J. Kinyon ’18, though, was more optimistic, praising the new program for allowing students to take divisional classes to fulfill Gen Ed requirements.
“I think it’s really cool to provide some more flexibility for kids so that they can stay within their comfort realm but study it within other realms as well,” Kinyon said.

With Harvard Management Company readying to undergo the most dramatic change to its investment strategy in decades, some alumni said they are cautiously optimistic about the shift towards external management, while others remain focused on compensation structures at the firm.
Last month, HMC announced it would all but gut its internal management teams and reduce its workforce by nearly half by the end of 2017. The firm managing Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment will also make critical changes to its compensation formula, tying the pay of its executives to the overall performance of the endowment instead of to the performance of individual asset classes.
Some alumni said they are hopeful that the changes will improve the firm’s performance, which has faltered in recent years. In fiscal year 2016, Harvard posted the worst returns on its investments since the height of the financial crisis at negative 2 percent, contributing to a nearly-$2 billion drop in the endowment's value.
Robert B. Shetterly ’69, a member of a group of alumni which has long criticized “excessive” executive compensation at HMC, said laying off the firm’s internal managers is warranted “especially if they weren’t doing that good a job in the first place.”
But others are doubtful that the changes are the cure-all for HMC’s investment woes. Paul J. Zofnass ’69, a donor to the University, said he does not believe one investment model is inherently better than the other.
“I’m not convinced that internally is any more or less effective than subcontracting it out for somebody else to do,” Zofnass said. “The real issue is—whether you’re doing it internally or subcontracting it out—are the right decisions being made in terms of the investments?”
For years, HMC had stuck by its unique “hybrid”  investment strategy, managing most of its assets internally. Experts predicted HMC’s new investment chief N. P. Narvekar would align the firm’s investment strategy with the external models in place at peer institutions, like Yale and Columbia.
Laurence L. Brunton ’69  said he is not particularly worried about the endowment’s lackluster performance, but rather the “immoral” payouts the Company’s managers receive.
“I still would wonder what they’re going to pay for these services,” Brunton said, referring to the new external managers.
Although some Harvard alumni have voiced support for change in investment model, others maintain that HMC’s executive compensation formula, if not seriously addressed, might undercut any positive changes to the firm.
According to Narvekar’s announcement, the firm’s new pay structure “fully aligns the generalist investment team with the performance of the overall endowment.” In response to criticisms of executive compensation at HMC, administrators have argued that they are making changes to improve the system.
David E. Kaiser ’69 said he and members of his class have sent “dozens” of letters to University President Drew G. Faust and members of the Harvard Corporation in an effort to learn more about the firm’s pay structure. While University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan defended HMC’s compensation model in a Dec. letter to the group, Kaiser said he is unsatisfied with Harvard’s replies to his concerns.
“They’ve never, in their responses to us, given us a response,” Kaiser said.

Datamatch 2017—the Harvard Computer Society’s annual Valentine’s Day matchmaking survey—drew criticism from students for what some called its “disconcerting” presentation of a non-binary gender response field.
A Valentine’s Day tradition on campus since 1994, Datamatch partners annual with Harvard Square eateries—this year at El Jefe’s Taqueria, Flour Bakery, BerryLine, and Zinneken’s—to pay for the meals of the couples it matches. For Datamatch, Students complete an online survey and receive "matches" with compatible results.
This year’s Datamatch, however, has sparked criticism from students for including only “male” and “female” gender response options, and requiring students to choose one option to complete the survey. Participants who wanted to include more information about their gender could do so in a section designated for “extra” information at the end of the survey.
“I saw that the options were male, female, and then you had to put any other gender identity markers into this ‘extra’ section that was at the end of it,” Darius A. Johnson ’18 said. “That wording—or that separation—was super disconcerting to me, of the two binary options being the ‘normal’ options, and anything else being the extra. I thought that was a huge oversight on their part.”
Raynor J. Kuang ’17, a leader of the Datamatch development team, said HCS received feedback about the interface and hopes to work with students to rectify concerns about gender identification in future iterations of the program. The survey’s open-response entry has since been moved to an earlier section, adjacent to the gender field.
“Datamatch did not do enough to include people of non-binary genders—that was abundantly clear,” Kuang said. “We want feedback; we take this extremely seriously.”
In a Facebook post to the HCS Datamatch page, Kuang proposed adding a non-binary choice to the “gender” and “match with” fields in the future, as well as allowing participants to select multiple options for both.
“Whatever the answer is, we need to try and discover it, and we need to try our best to be inclusive,” Kuang said in an interview. “Everything is still in the process right now. I have this proposal and I need to contact campus groups.”
For Johnson, the gender option is significant because Datamatch is a “quintessential” part of Harvard’s culture. At the weekly meeting of the Undergraduate Council Sunday, representative Nicholas Whittaker ’19 gathered signatures for a petition criticizing Datamatch and its binary gender options.
As of Sunday evening, over 3,500 students had registered for this year’s Datamatch.
“Calling gender non-conformity or any gender non-binary identity ‘extra’ is sort of tactless nomenclature,” Johnson said. “You can’t put a part of someone’s identity in parentheses and say that’s ‘extra’ information about them.”
Last February, 4,195 students participated in the collaboration between HCS and Satire V, representing over 60 percent of students at the College—in contrast, less than half of the student body cast online ballots in the most recent two Undergraduate Council presidential elections. Datamatch closes on the midnight of Valentine’s Day and results will be sent out the next morning.
This year, Satire V created its own parody of the Valentine’s Day algorithm called “NumberSex.” Daniel J. Kenny ’18, editor-in-chief of Satire V, said the humor publication thought it could make a funnier version that mocked Datamatch at the same time.
“What is the basic thing that Datamatch is always implying? They’re trying to use their numbers, so that you have sex,” Kenny said. “Why don’t we just mock them by being totally up front: It’s called NumberSex.”
Although Satire V did not initially intend to create an algorithm for their 18-question Google form, Kenny said that NumberSex participants will receive matches after an unexpectedly large number of students chose to participate. Over 1,000 undergraduates were registered by Sunday evening, even though the Satire V version will not come with the possibility of free food.
“It was definitely inspired by the inner machinations of a wise old Furby, but we also have people who know how to code,” Kenny said. “It’s going to match people up based on similar responses, so kind of the same thing, but with less Steven Pinker.”

The Undergraduate Council voted to form an “identity coalition” at its general meeting Sunday and create an avenue for minority students to communicate with the Council and administration, fulfilling a campaign promise made by its leaders.
The identity coalition, spearheaded by UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, will operate in partnership with the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ Student Advisory Committee.
Although UC representatives did not detail in the legislation specific student populations that will be represented in the body, Sachee and Khansarinia have said they see the group as an outlet for students of color, first-generation students, and BGLTQ students. Legislation proposing the identity coalition said it will represent the College’s “underrepresented minorities and marginalized communities.”
The Council voted unanimously to create the identity coalition.
Dylan R. de Waart ’19 and Yousra Neberai ’18, two co-chairs of the Harvard Foundation’s Student Advisory Committee, spoke at the meeting to address UC members’ questions about the prospective partnership between groups. After the meeting, de Waart said he was excited to see the cooperation between the UC and its partners.
“This partnership between the Harvard Foundation SAC and the Undergraduate Council marks a new chapter in student issues advocacy on campus—integrating affinity groups, the administration, the Harvard Foundation, and the Undergraduate Council,” he said.
Cabot House representative Christopher B. Cruz ’17 proposed an amendment to the legislation to ensure that groups without members in the coalition will still receive resources and support from the UC.
“If a group is not part of the coalition, we’re not going to exclude them from...being able to speak, getting connections to the administration,” he said at the meeting. “I think it should be a duty of ours to be as inclusive and welcoming to any groups that want to be connected to those resources, whether or not they choose to join the identity coalition.
Earlier in the meeting, Javier Cuan-Martinez, representing the Harvard Computer Society, addressed some students’ concerns that Datamatch—an algorithm meant to connect students on Valentine’s Day— reinforced a gender binary by forcing students to check a box with “male” or “female.”
Currently, though, students may elaborate on their gender identity in a text box below. Martinez said he empathized with students’ concerns and apologized at the meeting.
“I, on behalf of the Harvard Computer Society and on Datamatch, take full responsibility for the exclusion that we have created on campus,” Martinez said. “It was a poor design decision and we look forward to working with all the organizations and making sure that Datamatch is as inclusive as possible in the future.”
Adams House representative Nicholas Whittaker ’19 proposed signing a letter from Council members admonishing Datamatch and its binary gender options. After the meeting, Whittaker collected signatures from fellow UC representatives for the cause.
The UC has previously partnered with Datamatch to help fund dates to local eateries in the Square.
“I’m proposing an undersigned letter, a statement of support with the gender non-conforming and gender queer community after Datamatch implicitly excluded them from the experience,” Whittaker said.

UPDATED: February 14, 2017 at 4:08 p.m. 
Harvard signed an additional amicus brief challenging President Donald Trump’s immigration order Monday, joining 16 other universities to argue that the order has damaged their institutions.
The brief, filed in a Brooklyn, N.Y. federal court, is the second amicus brief the University has filed opposing the order, which aims to bar immigrants from seven countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—for 90 days. An appeals court ruling last week upheld a temporary stay of Trump’s order.
In the brief, the universities list their global missions and argue that the order impedes their abilities to fulfill them.
“While the Executive Order is currently limited to seven countries, its damaging effects have already been widely felt by American universities,” the brief reads.
Specifically, the universities point to students and scholars who were stranded outside of the country, negative effects on the institutions’ ability to attract foreign scholars in the future, and “institutional anxiety” plaguing their international affiliates as a result of the order.
“These costs are significant and directly affect amici’s ability to pursue their missions,” they wrote. “And they are being experienced absent any evidence that amici’s lawfully-present students, faculty, and scholars—all of whom have already undergone significant vetting by the government—pose any threat to the safety or security of the United States or amici’s campuses.”
At least four Harvard affiliates have had difficulty entering the United States as a result of Trump’s order, and more than 100 total Harvard scholars and students come from the seven listed countries.
Harvard joins Brown, Carnegie Mellon, University of Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Northwestern, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Stanford, Vanderbilt, and Yale.
The amicus brief is the latest in a series of actions Harvard has taken to oppose Trump’s order. Harvard’s General Counsel filed the first amicus brief in a Boston suit on Feb. 4. University President Drew G. Faust joined 48 other university presidents in signing a letter to Trump opposing the immigration ban, and Harvard’s Immigration and Refugee Law Clinic has provided legal counsel to impacted affiliates and filed an amicus brief in the Washington State suit that reached the appellate court last week.

A halftime proposal. The return of the program’s storied alumni. Breast cancer awareness night. The atmosphere was raucous, and it helped propel the Harvard women’s basketball team to a 69-59 win at Lavietes Pavilion over visiting Brown.
“The [atmosphere] was wild,” said captain Destiny Nunley. “In the beginning in our huddle, right before we go on the court, I said ‘Let’s play for everyone who’s worn a Harvard jersey.’ I hope that inspired everyone. We wanted to win for the alumni.”
In front of its largest crowd of the season, the Crimson (17-3, 5-2 Ivy) was able to overcome a number of runs by the Bears (13-7, 4-3) to break its two-game losing streak. It was, in a sense, a matchup that would help decide which of the two teams would contend for the conference title this season, and it appears Harvard answered that question.
The game was tight throughout, and it wasn’t until late in the fourth quarter that the Crimson finally put the nail in Brown’s coffin. Six straight points from Bears freshman Justine Gaziano, their leading scorer on the season and deliverer of 16 on the night, cut the lead to just one with 7:53 remaining. A clutch three by sophomore guard Nani Redford followed by a trademark Nunley baseline jumper provided some breathing room before Harvard suffocated the game, allowing zero points between the 6:31 and 1:47 marks of the final quarter.
“For us, we put most of our emphasis on defense,” said Nunley. “Every game that we won, it was because of our defense. I think that must be something that is different from other teams, because we put an emphasis on defense.”
Both teams pushed the pace at the start of the game, averaging a shot attempt every 15 seconds. Freshman center Jeannie Boehm was effective finding the open teammate early on, with all three of her assists coming in the first quarter. Boehm finished with 11 points, five rebounds, three blocks, and two steals on the night.
As Brown settled into the game and made adjustments, Harvard struggled to react. Turnovers and poor outside shot selection allowed the Bears to come back into the game after a tough start. A pair of threes by freshman guard Katie Benzan tied things up at 16 as the first frame expired.
“We want to go inside, but [our guards] were shoving it down Jeannie’s throat and they weren’t seeing the floor,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I’d like a little less of that since she’s a freshman… she doesn’t always compose and look and then make her decision. She found [players] diving, but then Brown took it away, and Jeannie wanted to still make that pass and it wasn’t there. She needs to find the composure and look for the shooters on the perimeter.”
The Crimson started the second quarter strong, forcing Brown into offensive mistakes and taking advantage at the other end. Benzan and junior forward Taylor Rooks combined for Harvard’s first 11 points of the frame and helped stretch the lead to nine, 29-20, midway through the quarter. A trio of Bears threes, fueled by sophomore guard Shayna Mehta, who had 12 points, 10 rebounds, and four assists on the night, helped cut the halftime deficit to just three.
Gaziano, Benzan’s main competition for Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and sophomore guard Taylor Will combined to reverse the Crimson’s strong start to the third quarter, propelling Brown to a 10-2 run which saw the Bears take their first lead since the first quarter with 2:33 left in the third. Allowing opponents back into games has been a common theme for Harvard this season, something that has prevented the Crimson from blowing teams out.
“[Extending leads] is what we need to learn how to do,” said Delaney-Smith. “This week I think we’ll spend working on stretching the lead.”


Lockdown fourth quarter defense and a couple of big buckets by Nunley helped seal the deal for the hosts, allowing Harvard to return to its winning ways after seeing its 16-game win streak end in disappointing fashion last weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experience being the best teacher, the Harvard track and field team is trying to get as much of it as possible with a mere two weeks left until the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. Friday’s and Saturday's competitions represented the final weekend of meets before the make-or-break event. To prepare, the teams traveled to five meets on Friday and Saturday.
Forty athletes competed locally over the weekend at the Valentine Invitational hosted by Boston University. On the opening day of competition, freshman Micah Meekins got the ball rolling with a personal best of 24.76 seconds in the 200-meter dash, earning a sixth place finish. Another freshman, Livia Gauntlett, also achieved a personal best in the sprints with fourth place in the 60-meter hurdles.
“The team is really starting to come together with Heps approaching,” freshman sprinter Jacob McLennan said. “We have had some outstanding performances these past couple weeks. I'm really looking forward to see what we can accomplish.”
It was in the field, though, that the team really excelled. Senior Nikki Okwelogu opened up for the women with a 16.28-meter throw in shot put on her last attempt, good for first place. Her teammate, sophomore pole vaulter Nicole Trenchard, cleared 3.65 meters on her way to the podium with a bronze medal.
The second day of competition would be less fruitful for the teams, though more athletes surpassed individual landmarks. The top finish of the day came courtesy of junior Jay Hebert in the 60-meter hurdles. The consistent hurdler climbed to second place on the podium with a strong 8.11 second finish. In the version of this event minus the hurdles, junior Malcolm Johnson claimed the 10th place position with a time of 6.99 seconds. Junior Alexander Moore tied a personal best in the 200-meter dash as he finished in 22.03 seconds to claim the 24th position.
Claiming a personal best of his own, Freshman Michael Kolor finished in the 21st position after a 1:51.81 800-meter run. Senior James Heckendorn put out a season-best 48.64-second 400-meter dash on his way to a 19th place finish.
The long distance team also achieved a pair of personal bests. Gabe Montague, a junior from Newton, Massachusetts, finished seventh in the 1000-meter run with a time of 2:24.70 for his personal record and the fourth best time in school history. It was in the 3000-meter run that sophomore Kieran Tuntivate claimed his own best, with his time of 8:09.85 earning an eighth place finish.
In the field events, only two seniors, each holding fifth place medals, were standing in the end. Captain Julian Nunally starting things off with a 16.72 meter shot put to claim his medal. In the weight throw, Josh Whitener reigned supreme with a 17.78 meter toss.
“I am feeling really good about our men's team,” McLennan said. “Everyone has been putting in a lot of work at the track this school year, and the amount of support we are giving one another is second to none.”
Down south at the Tyson Invitational hosted by the University of Arkansas, only a half-dozen Crimson runners competed. Of those six, four finished near the top of the podium. Kicking things off Friday was sophomore Ngozi Musa in the 60-meter dash. The Washington native performed her personal best for an indoor meet with a 7.52 second preliminary run. The other sprinter, senior Jade Miller, took eleventh after a 54.63 second 400-meter dash performance.
Last week, Miller was selected as one of three spotlighted women’s athletes by HepsTrack.com. This honor came as a result of Miller recording a personal best in the 400-meter and season best in the 60-meter hurdles. She was also a member of the 4x400-meter relay team that clocked the best time of the 2017 season at 3:39.50.
In the field, Friday’s competitors nearly mirrored each other. Freshman long jumpers Simi Fajemisin and Zoe Hughes both hit the 5.75-meter mark to finish 14th and 15th, respectively.
Things picked up on Saturday for the group of competitors. In the 200-meter dash, Miller clocked a season best at 24:67 seconds and claimed the 33rd spot. Teammate Gabby Thomas took seventh in the same race with a time of 23.57.
Seven student athletes traveled across the country to the University of Washington for the Husky Classic. The highlight of the event was the 5000-meter race, in which freshman Judy Pendergast placed second and subsequently clocked the third-fastest run in school history and the sixth-fastest in Ivy history.
At the Millrose Games, sophomore Myles Marshall traveled from the Valentine Invitational to compete in the Mel Sheppard 1000-meter run in New York. In the race, Marshall ran the race in 2:29.23 to place eighth.
Only two weeks remain for the teams to prepare for the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. There, Harvard will hope to continue its recent success, namely the women’s Ivy League championship earlier this season and the track team’s success last year.
“The team is definitely taking steps forward,” Pendergast said. “We are all focused on just consistently improving throughout the season and this past weekend was a good checkpoint. We still have work to do, but we are pleased with this past weekend for sure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (4-18-5, 4-11-4 ECAC) traveled to New York for its final away games of the 2016-17 season. The front half of the trip saw a milestone achieved, as head coach Katey Stone picked up her 450th career win with the Crimson on Friday against Union College (4-25-1, 1-17-1). However, the team was unable to keep up the momentum and dropped Saturday’s contest against Rensselaer (10-20-2, 7-12-1).
RENSSELAER 4, HARVARD 1
Though Friday’s victory over Union gave some momentum to the road team heading into Saturday, Rensselaer still took down Harvard with a three-goal second period to cruise to a 4-1 victory on RPI’s senior night. The Engineers’ three-goal outburst in the span of 10 minutes also put a huge dent in the Crimson’s playoff hopes, as Rensselaer now stands three points ahead of Harvard for the final playoff spot with two games to play.
“The second period was a bad dream for all of us,” said Stone in a Harvard Athletics interview after the game. “I thought RPI did a good job to weather our pressure and played good defense. We kept running around on our defensive end today, and it hurt us.”
RPI junior Whitney Renn scored twice in the game, and her second goal at 5:03 of the second broke a 1-1 tie. The home team scored again on a power play less than three minutes later, and finally, at 14:51, the Engineers closed the scoring with their third goal of the period to open up a decisive 4-1 lead.
In the final minute of the period, Tse nearly scored one for the Crimson to bring the score to 4-2, but her shot ricocheted off the post.
Rensselaer struck first in the first period, as Renn’s shot sneaked past Larcom, but Harvard responded quickly just 21 seconds later. Freshman forward Kat Hughes picked up the puck at center ice and forwarded it to junior forward Lexie Laing, who got entangled with an RPI player. Freshman forward Val Turgeon gathered the loose puck quickly, however, and broke free down the left side, firing into the top right corner for the tying score.
In the final frame, the Crimson fired off 10 shots to Rensselaer’s 8, but neither team was able to net another score.
“We have to win two hockey games, one at a time, and hope now that we get some help,” Stone said, describing the team’s playoff chances with two games left.
The win gives Rensselaer its first season sweep over Harvard since 2009-10, as the Engineers also defeated the Crimson earlier this season in Cambridge.
HARVARD 2, UNION 0
In the team’s first matchup of the weekend, Harvard outshot Union 38-12 en route to a 2-0 win, giving Stone her 450th win at the helm of the Crimson. Stone currently stands as the winningest coach in the history of women’s Division I hockey, with her next closest competitor 10 wins behind.
After firing off 15 shots in the first period, co-captain Briana Mastel opened Harvard’s scoring less than two minutes into the second period with a shot from the left faceoff circle while falling to her knees. On the play, sophomore forward Kate Hallet took a pass from freshman defender Kyra Colbert and backhanded it across the crease to Mastel, who fired it home for the score. The Crimson, playing on a one-goal lead, went onto outshoot the Dutchwomen 11-1 in the second period.
In the third period, Harvard’s defensive dominance continued, as the team conceded only four more shots to Union. With 11:07 remaining in the third, sophomore defender Kaitlin Tse found junior forward Haley Mullins, whose shot into the top left corner doubled the Crimson’s lead.
Freshman goalie Beth Larcom tallied 12 saves on the day in her first career victory.
Harvard returns to action next weekend at home, playing its final two games of the regular season with matchups against Yale and Brown on February 17 and 18.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Devin Tringale has never played in a Beanpot championship game. But the local boy from Medford, Mass., has certainly dreamed of winning one.
“I think we’ve all pictured it 1,000 times,” the former Lawrence Academy star said. “It’s something that would be a true highlight of the season for us. It would be one of the highlights of our careers.”
Tonight, for both the first and final time, Tringale has an opportunity to convert that dream into reality. Having beaten Northeastern, 4-3, in the semifinals last Monday, the Harvard men’s hockey team (17-5-2, 12-4-2 ECAC) now stands 60 minutes from a Beanpot trophy for the first time in almost a decade.
But to actually end its championship drought—one that’s lasted since 1993—the Crimson will have to fend off a team that’s far more familiar with playing for hardware. A program that has reached 18 Beanpot title games and won 13 since the club from Cambridge last seized bragging rights over the Hub.
That opponent is Boston University, a 30-time Beanpot champion who narrowly edged out the Crimson at Agganis Arena back in November.
After that contest, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said he hoped to see the Terriers again. But of course, Donato’s ‘hopes’ have to be far different from his captain’s. There’s no doubting that Tringale wants a trophy in his hands, but the Crimson coach of 13 seasons probably wouldn’t have minded avoiding a rematch with BU, a popular preseason pick to win the national championship.
The youngest team in college hockey, the Terriers (19-8-2, 11-5-2 Hockey East) enter Monday ranked third in both the polls and the PairWise—just one spot ahead of Harvard. The Crimson—fresh off a resounding 6-2 victory Friday night against No. 6 Union—could stand to move ahead of BU in the new polls released this afternoon, but in reality, no one’s keeping track. Regardless of how you look at it, tonight’s championship game features the two best teams in the East.
The two rosters feature a total of 19 NHL draft picks, the most highly touted of which was absent when the teams met earlier this season at Agganis Arena. Terrier freshman Clayton Keller, the seventh overall pick a year ago, is now back from an injury and has logged at least a point in 18 of the 21 games he’s played for BU. A shorthanded goal in a 3-1 semifinal win over No. 7 Boston College was just the latest highlight of his 15-game point streak, which began on Nov. 4 and finally ended on Friday.
Another Terrier getting set to play Harvard for the first time tonight will be freshman goaltender Jake Oettinger, who owns the third-lowest goals against average (1.80) and the fourth-highest save percentage (.935) in the country.
“We have to get second and third looks at it with him; he’s so big and so strong,” Donato said. “They have so many talented guys that I think we’re better served really focusing on playing our own game and doing what we do as [well] as we can to maybe nullify some of their great teamwork and talent.”
Donato’s club has done well to hang with talented Terrier teams over the last few years, but since knocking off a top-ranked BU team at Agganis in 2014, the Crimson has come up short against the Terriers in three consecutive contests: a 4-3 double-overtime heartbreaker at the 2015 Beanpot, a 6-5 battle at the Bright where the Terriers stormed back from two-down late, and a 5-3 thriller earlier this season.
But in tonight’s TD Garden nightcap, the stakes are strikingly higher. And with a trophy on the line, especially one that’s been coveted for so long by so many, you might as well throw out the two sides’ recent history.
“Growing up as a kid, there were a couple of goals we would dream of—a Stanley Cup goal, a national championship goal. [O]ne of the big ones was a Beanpot goal,” sophomore Ryan Donato said. “Obviously playing for a championship and being able to put something back in one of the cases in here would be a great thing.”
The last time Harvard deposited a Beanpot trophy was 1993, when the Crimson topped a red-hot BU team that had won 16 of its last 18 games. Similarly, the Terriers head into this year’s final as winners of 11 of their previous 14.
But BU has stumbled a few times in recent weeks. The Terriers let a 2-1 lead slip away at No. 9 UMass-Lowell on Friday and were shockingly swept by Merrimack in a two-game set towards the end of January.
Meanwhile, Harvard, whom BU coach David Quinn labeled as a serious national title contender back in November, heads into the game of the year riding a seven-game unbeaten streak. Since suffering a week-long setback that included losses to Rensselaer and Dartmouth, the Crimson has righted the ship and gotten back to playing quality hockey.
For Harvard to win its 11th Beanpot in program history, however, that ship now needs to withstand its toughest test to date. But the Crimson knows what’s at stake. And despite coming up on two weeks of age, the words of Tringale remain relevant.
“Being here isn’t good enough, right? I mean, we want to win it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend’s doubleheader for the Harvard men’s volleyball team (3-4, 1-1 EIVA) concluded with mixed results. The same weekend that saw the Crimson squeeze by No. 15 George Mason (5-5, 2-1) in an exciting comeback on Saturday night also saw Harvard fall to the same Patriots team in straight sets on Sunday afternoon.
NO. 15 GEORGE MASON 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson’s enthusiastic three-set comeback victory did not carry over to Sunday afternoon’s performance, as the Patriots defeated Harvard in three frames to break even on the weekend series.
Going into the match, the Crimson pushed to maintain a high energy level and stay patient on defense.
“You never know if they are going to keep coming with the same strategy,” Coach Baise said.“We will try to slow them down and get their hitting percentage down.”
Harvard was unable to fulfill Baise’s points of emphasis Sunday, as the team allowed 43 kills from the Patriots and an average hitting percentage of .380, compared to the Crimson’s 28 kills and .189 hitting percentage. Defensively, Harvard was a step behind as well, finishing with seven fewer digs than George Mason had over three sets.
A hard-fought loss in the first set by the Crimson was followed by a disappointing 25-18 defeat in the second set, and Harvard eventually ran out of gas, unable to muster up the strength to repeat Saturday night’s comeback. The .103 hitting percentage in the second set was the lowest from both teams on the night and Harvard’s lowest in the past six sets.
“I think going forward in this year, we have to play with a lot of energy,” sophomore blocker Spencer Scott said. “That was really key for us in the performance.”
A 6-1 run in the middle of the second set by the Patriots drained the Crimson of any energy it carried from the previous night, as Harvard was incapable of stopping George Mason’s aggressive attacking duo of Jack Wilson and Radoslav Popov, who finished with 16 and 14 kills, respectively.
With a .500 record in conference play, the Crimson will look to improve from the weekend’s performance as it heads to Pennsylvania to take on highly ranked Penn State and St. Francis.
HARVARD 3, NO. 15 GEORGE MASON 2
Harvard kicked off the start of EIVA play with a resounding victory over George Mason at the Malkin Athletic Center Saturday after falling behind 0-2.
“As the game progressed, we made some adjustments as far as how we were playing defensively and how we were running our offense,” co-captain Samuel Murphy said. “We brought some more energy...which made all the difference.”
With the Patriots ready to finish the match in the third set, the Crimson buckled down and grinded out a 25-22 win. Co-captain Casey White, who ended the game with seven kills alongside six assists, completed the rally in set three with two kills.
“The first two sets were pretty one-sided,” Baise said. “We weren’t playing well; we were out of sync, and our communication wasn’t great.”
Starting off neck-and-neck in the first set, Harvard fell apart after a 16-16 score, allowing six unanswered points and settling for a 25-18 final set score. The second set mirrored a similar pattern, as the Crimson fought to an 18-18 tie only to allow George Mason to go on a 7-3 run to conclude the set.
As Harvard gained momentum through the third set, it was clear that the game was shifting in the Crimson’s favor. Hitting only .074 in the first set and .286 in the second set, Harvard finished the fourth set with a dominating .417 hitting percentage, banking off a game-high thirteen kills.
The team fed off the raucous energy of the home crowd Saturday night, helping to propel the Crimson to a 3-2 victory.
“Crowd size was at the max. It was fun getting some extra people out,” Murphy said. “When the crowd’s getting loud, that definitely gets the guys on the court going.”
Harvard finished the hard-fought comeback with a 15-10 fifth set victory, hitting .290 overall to close out a high-ranked opponent in George Mason. Baise applauded the resilience of the team and noted in particular the strong performances by junior setter Marko Kostich, freshman hitter Erik Johnsson, and White.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team (18-3, Ivy 6-2) capped its weekend with a dominant victory over rival Yale (11-10, Ivy 2-6) with a the 76-56 victory, its largest margin of victory over an Ancient Eight team this season. The Crimson has struggled to capitalize on early game leads for much of the season, but after a rough road trip the previous week Harvard sought to bounce back against their rival.
“I think we played really well, we moved the ball really well, and everyone got their touches,” freshman Katie Benzan said. “It was feel-good basketball. No one was ball hogging, no one was playing selfishly—it was just really fun.”
Strong performances by Benzan and sophomore guard Madeline Raster led the Crimson to its sixth Ivy League win. Benzan recorded her first career double-double with 19 points and 10 assists, while Raster recorded a career-high 24 points to propel Harvard to the decisive victory.
“I love playing with [Madeline]. She’s such a great shooter, scorer, and she’s great in the sense that when she messes up, she’s says ‘Oh that’s my bad.’ I love that responsibility of her,” Benzan said. “She doesn’t care who shoots, who scores, she just wants the one score up on the scoreboard. We complement each other really well—I give her good passes and then she kicks ahead to me. We’re just two peas in a pod.”
The entire unit appeared to march to the beat of the same drum, as the Crimson’s stifling defense along with lights out shooting (57 percent) overwhelmed the Bulldogs and resulted in Harvard doing something it has yet to do against an Ivy League opponent all season—get ahead and stay ahead.
“First time we beat someone by 20 in the Ivy League—[it’s] something we’ve been wanting to do, so we feel really proud about that,” co-captain Destiny Nunley said. “We moved the ball and we had our shooting percentage back to what we wanted it to be. We got a lot of shots up [in practice] this week so it definitely paid off.”
Nunley, who had 12 points and led the team with six boards, lead the effort on the defensive side of the ball as well, recording three blocks, a component that has been crucial to the Crimson’s success.
Similarly, Harvard’s improved shot selection was an equally vital part of its successful game-plan. Last week, the Crimson shot under 35 percent from the field, costing the team not only the winning streak, but the top spot in the Ivy League as well. Learning from last week’s tough losses was a focus in practice, according to the team.
“We know what we did wrong last weekend and we worked on it all week, so I did see what we worked on show up in the game,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “That’s why our shot selection was better, that’s why our shooting accuracy was better—it was because we executed better.”
As Harvard looks forward to a road trip to the Empire State, it hopes to be able to continue to build off huge leads, something it was unable to do against either Cornell or Columbia two weeks prior.
“I don’t want to say we’re not worried, but we’re expecting to play like we did tonight,” Nunley said. “Defense and rebounding was our top priority, so as long as we stick to that and keep that in mind, we’ll be fine.”
The relationships the young squad has formed over the course of the year has resulted in the Crimson being a legitimate Ivy League championship contender, and, although not the focus, has initiated whispers at a possible trip to the big dance in March.
“It starts off the court. We just make these great relationships off the court, whether it’s staying up really late in the library doing work together or singing karaoke together,” Benzan said. “It’s just making those relationships off the court and [moving them] onto the court. Building that trust and playing together is just icing on the cake.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With an undefeated Ivy League regular season on the line, the No. 1 Harvard men’s squash team set out to an early 4-0 lead against the defending national champions, No. 8 Yale. However, that scoreline was no indication as to where the match would end up.
As senior Dylan Murray, junior Bradley Smith, and co-captain Bryan Koh each went down in consecutive fashion at the seventh, second, and sixth positions, respectively, momentum shifted drastically towards the Bulldogs (8-6, 5-2 Ivy League). It was up to freshman Saadeldin Abouaish and sophomore Alexi Gosset to put an end to the loss streak and clinch the match winning fifth victory for the Crimson. Gosset did just that, besting his opponent, 3-0, in a drawn out three game bout.
“We knew that Yale wasn’t going to give it away easily today,” co-captain Devin McLaughlin said. “They’re a strong team with a bunch of experienced players, so we didn’t take anything for granted even when we were up 4-0. They clawed their way back to 4-4, but our number nine Alexi Gosset was able to seal the deal for us.”
With the 5-4 victory in hand, Harvard (11-1, 7-0 Ivy) claimed sole possession of the Ancient Eight title by posting its second undefeated Ivy season in the past three years. Earlier in the weekend, the Crimson had clinched at least a share of the title after its 8-1 win over No. 20 Brown (3-9, 0-7 Ivy).
HARVARD 5, YALE 4
Harvard was missing one of its most consistent performers in its match against Yale on Sunday at the Murr Center, as junior David Ryan went down with an illness earlier in the day. The players below the Dublin, Ireland native performed soundly in his absence, going 3-2 on the day.
When it counted, the contest’s final result came down to Gosset and Abouaish. Thrust into the ladder as a result of Ryan’s aforementioned illness, Gosset performed admirably. The Ontario, Canada native executed coolly under the pressure of needing a match win, as victory never seemed to be out of the question after his dominant first game. Gosset ultimately achieved a solid tally, 11-2, 11-8, 11-9.
Today was an example of our ability to compete when things didn't go to plan,” freshman Timmy Brownell said. “We lost a top player to illness right before the Yale match, but our number ten player Alexi Gosset stepped up and clinched the match and the Ivy League title in a very impressive performance.”
At the first position, Abouaish played quality shots throughout his match, but the rookie was unable to best his older competitor in a three-game loss. With the result, Abouaish completed his rookie campaign at the ever-difficult top slot with an 8-4 record.
Led by decisive play from McLaughlin, Brownell, junior Madhav Dhingra, and freshman Sean Hughes, the Crimson sprinted out to a quick lead.  Hughes, Ryan’s replacement at the fifth position, was able to grind his way to an 11-7, 11-3, 11-9 victory against hard-hitting Bulldogs junior Max Martin. Brownell and McLaughlin also bested their opponents in simple 3-0 victories, while Dhingra took four games to put away his challenger, 3-1.
Still slightly hampered an injury to his right calf, Murray was the first Harvard player to concede defeat. Playing at the eighth position, the senior fought his way to a fourth game after having lost the first two sets, 11-7, 11-9. His competitor proved to be too much for Murray, as he subsequently lost the fourth by an 11-7 score.
Smith and Koh successively followed Murray to defeat. Playing consistent, methodical squash in his contest at the sixth position, Koh couldn’t seem to match the fire of his competitor when it counted, ultimately losing three consecutive tight sets to Bulldogs junior Thomas Kingshott.
Smith also suffered a three game loss, 11-6, 13-11, 11-2. The junior got into more of a rhythm in the second game of his match, but couldn’t break through late in the second and ultimately faded in the third.
HARVARD 8, BROWN 1
The Crimson’s match against the Bears at the Pizzitola Squash Courts in Providence, R.I. on Friday was largely a routine affair by comparison. Harvard easily took the top eight matches with each of its players in those positions on the ladder handily besting their opponents, 3-0. The Crimson’s lone loss came from its ninth position player, as senior Gordon Michas and Brown senior Alexander Baldock went down to the wire in a five-gamer.
“Against Brown, I think our team played very professionally,” McLaughlin said. “While on paper we were the stronger team, no one underestimated their opponents and it was all business out on the court, so we were happy with the result.”
Both coming off triumphs against Cornell on Sunday, Gosset and junior Mandela Patrick were again among Harvard victors. Abouaish, Brownell, Ryan, Hughes, Koh, and McLaughlin also put in dominant performances at their respective positions to set the match’s final result.
With a season goal of claiming the Ivy League title having been completed, the Crimson turns it attention to CSA Team Nationals next weekend, where it hopes to claim its first Potter Cup since the 2013-2014 season and the 32nd national championship in the program’s storied history.
“Heading into the final week of the season we're going to try to stay healthy and fit for the nationals, but regardless of the eventual outcome, this is a great team and we've had a tremendous season thus far,” Brownell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since 2003, Harvard women’s squash is a back-to-back Ivy League champion.
The result emerged from a busy weekend in which the team played three days in a row. After a quick away contest at Brown (5-5, 0-5 Ivy League), the No. 1 Crimson hosted Stanford and Yale at home.
The clash with the Cardinal (4-6) marked the second matchup this season, which was the first time that the two teams had played a home-and-home series. Meanwhile, the Sunday date with the Bulldogs (11-4, 4-3) gave Harvard a chance to clinch the crown with a win.
Ultimately, there was little suspense. The top-ranked Crimson (12-0, 7-0) breezed through a trio of sweeps and glided its way to a second straight crown.
Despite the team’s long string of dominance, it had not won the Ivy League crown twice in a row since 2003. This time, Harvard used the weekend as preparation for College Squash Association (CSA) National Team championship coming in two weeks, getting a final preview of possible opponents and gaining experience dealing with a demanding cluster of games.
But arguably the most important item on the agenda was the celebration of the final home games for the four seniors on the team, including co-captains Dileas MacGowan and Caroline Monrad, along with Keegan Mendez and Katie Tutrone.
“The team did really well this weekend, especially because it was the last matches of the season for the seniors,” freshman Gina Kennedy said. “So everyone was really pumped to play for them and help make sure they were sent off on a fine note. The seniors are a big part of the team, so it’s going to be really weird without them.”
HARVARD 9, YALE 0
With the Ancient Eight championship at stake, the Harvard underclassmen did their best to drain any drama from the final home match for the team’s seniors. Collectively, the youngsters did not drop a game and decided the contest early on Sunday afternoon.
With no pressure to perform for the team, the seniors were simply playing for pride and channeling their emotions into one last match on home court.
“They’ve definitely like sisters to me—people that I always know will be there,” Tutrone added. “One of the other seniors is like my closest friend, my roommate.”
MacGowan and Tutrone easily dispatched their opponents, while Monrad dropped the second game by a wide margin before recovering her form and winning in four. The most intense match of the competition came at the end, as Mendez dropped her first set.
But in this final pairing against the Bulldogs, the veteran rallied when the entire home contingent migrated to cheer. Mendez proceeded to take the match in four games over Yale junior Ashley Suan, thriving off the support from spectators and teammates alike. Exiting the squash court, Mendez, like every other victorious senior, received appreciative rounds of applause to end the afternoon of play.
For the past four years, the classmates have played together, and yesterday they won together.
“It’s a social scene a little bit, like people I would hang out with, not just in squash but also outside,” Tutrone said. “We’re all pretty close. We all have pretty similar intentions in life.”
HARVARD 9, STANFORD 0
Making the cross-country trip to face Dartmouth later on Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal stopped by in Boston for a morning match. But the Palo Alto program might have preferred to skip its rematch against Harvard, who provided another 9-0 thrashing.
The top eight players kept the score sheet flawless, not giving up any games. The Crimson had the opportunity to best its Jan. 16 match when it dropped just one game.
An exciting game at the No. 9 slot saw Mendez face off against sophomore Anna Marie Manning in a game that went to the maximum. The pair split the first four games in competitive fashion before Mendez took the final game, 11-8.
Stanford represented another mid-level team that Harvard has recently dominated, although the Cardinal is ranked No. 6, which would provide elite competition in just about every other sport. For the Crimson, the visitors stood as just another team to beat in order to maintain a perfect regular season.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
Before 2017, Harvard had faced Brown in 47 matches. The Crimson had won 47 times.
On Friday, Harvard took the short trip down Route 95 to face No. 6 Brown for a 48th time. As it turns out, nothing has changed.
The Crimson as a unit dropped just two games total in the thrashing of its conference opponent. The top two slots were won handily by British freshmen Gina Kennedy and Amelia Henley, who got bumped up in the lineup as the team faced a lesser opponent.
“We have been playing against each other since we were like ten years old,” Kennedy said. “We grew up in the same area so we were always rivals, now on the same team. We always represented England in stuff with each other, and we’re such good friends. It’s really nice to be on the same team.”
Further down the lineup Harvard was able to fight for wins, but the competition was tighter than the next day against Stanford, despite Brown’s lower ranking. Two matches went to four games, and other matches had smaller point differentials than the matches against the Cardinal. The results show that the rankings are imperfect, which is something that the Crimson must be careful about in the national championships, especially against teams Harvard has not faced.
The weekend acted as a tune-up for Nationals, giving good practice and confidence to the the Crimson squad. For the time being, there is no time to stop and reflect. The focus remains on winning a third straight collegiate squash championship.
“It wasn’t as sad as I thought it was going to be, I guess because I know I’m going to play at Nationals,” Tutrone said. “My friend was crying, but I didn’t feel it as much. I was just trying to play my best.”

Skiing at the Dartmouth Carnival in Hanover, N.H., the Harvard Ski Team braved the snow and tough competition to take 10th overall out of the 15 teams competing in the weekend’s races.
At the Craftsbury Outdoor Center, the fresh, hard-packed snow and cool temperatures made for ideal conditions for nordic skiing.
Led by senior captain Rachel Hampton and sophomores Hannah Hardenbergh and Nina Armstrong, the Crimson finished the 3X5K FS relay with a combined time of 44:05.4 to take home seventh place overall.
“We weren't able to achieve the results we were looking for,” junior Kelly Steeves said. “Dartmouth is a relatively flat hill and unforgiving hill that leaves no room for mistakes.”
A second trio, Junior Charlotte Cole, sophomore Lily Koffman and freshman Tegan Thorley, also had a strong showing in the 3X5K FS relay, placing 18th with a combined time of 46:29.2.
For the men, seniors Ian Meyer and Devlin Shea, along with freshman William Rhatigan, skied to an impressive eighth-place finish in the men's 3X5K FS relay with a time of 37:57.4.
Also in the 3X5K FS relay, juniors Connor Green and Haakon Sigurslid and freshman Mackinley Fitzpatrick finished 18th overall with a total time of 39:14.3.
Individually for the women, Hampton led the way in the 5K classic as well, taking home 15th place with a time of 16:14.0. Hampton was followed by Hardenbergh in 32nd, Thorley in 34th, and Armstrong in 35th.
In the men’s 10L classic, Meyer finished first of the Harvard skiers and 39th overall. Also scoring in the event were Rhatigan in 46th place and Fitzpatrick in 52nd.
For the alpine events at the Dartmouth Skiway, Steeves finished 47th overall in the giant slalom against a tough field of racers.
The Crimson will compete next weekend in the last EISA Carnival of the year in Middlebury, Vermont.
"It was a challenging weekend for the entire team,” Steves said. “We skied well. However, there was a very high level of competition at the race. We are all looking forward to the race at Middlebury next weekend where we have had success previously.”

The No. 21 Harvard women’s water polo team (4-1) brought home a trio of victories at the Bison Invitational at Bucknell University. The Crimson opened with a 5-4 win against No. 19 Wagner (2-7) and went on to dominate George Washington (2-1) 16-6 and Gannon (0-4) 17-2.
“I think the key area that we were able to improve upon this past weekend was our defense,”  sophomore Kristen Hong said. “Once our defense shut down our opponents offense, the rest came a lot easier.”
HARVARD 17, GANNON 2
On Sunday morning, Harvard cruised to a 17-2 win over Gannon, taking home its fourth consecutive win and forth game limiting its opponents to six goals or less. The Crimson kept Gannon to two goals, its lowest scores-allowed total since a 15-1 win over Notre Dame in 2015.
The victory was a true team effort with seven Harvard players scoring multiple goals and nine players recording assists.
Hong led the team with four finishes, while Carrera-Justiz recorded the first hat trick of her collegiate career.
Captain Martinelli and freshmen Ribordy, Harrison, Angie Varona, and Lana Gorlinski each found the back of the net twice against Gannon.
“I couldn’t have scripted it any better,” Minnis said.
HARVARD 16, GEORGE WASHINGTON 6
Showing their offensive strength, five different Harvard players scored multiple goals throughout the game, leading the Crimson to its first of two double-digit wins on the weekend.
Junior Sami Strutner led Harvard’s offense with her first hat trick of the season. Additionally, Senior co-captain Zoe Osborne, Martinelli, freshman Sofia Carrera-Justiz and Hong scored two goals each throughout the game, along with multiple assists each from Strutner, freshman Julie Harrison and senior Eela Nagaraj.
“We continued the momentum [from the Wagner game] when we played George Washington in the afternoon,” Minnis said.
HARVARD 5, WAGNER 4
Looking to rewrite last weekend’s 10-5 loss to Wagner, Harvard came out prepared for a defensive battle. Controlling the game from the beginning, co-captain Michelle Martinelli and freshman Mathilde Ribordy led the Crimson to an early 2-1 lead in the first quarter.
“We came out and really dictated the tempo against Wagner,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said.  “We did a good job executing our defensive game plan.”
Anchoring the Harvard team, junior Cleo Harrington recorded 15 saves in the net, limiting Wagner to only 4 goals.

Valentine’s Day is just around the corner…and by “around the corner,” we mean tomorrow! Don’t panic, you still have a few hours to snag a special someone. But if you’re forever alone like most of us, you know how annoying the lovey-dovey couples can get. If you’re in love, good for you, but you need to know when PDA goes too far:
Snuggling in the lecture hallJust because Sanders Theater has “theater” in the title does not mean that you can treat it like a movie date. So please, remove your arms from around each other, take your head off your beloved’s shoulder, and for the love of Mankiw, quit the back stroking. Especially if you’re sitting near the front. Some of us are here to learn.
Dining hall datesIf you and your significant other don’t want to spend money on food for date night, we support you. But please treat the dining hall like the safe space that it is. That means no lap sitting, no Lady-and-the-Tramp-style spaghetti slurping, no whipped cream play. It’ll make the single ones among us too grossed out to stomach our lonely food.
Hallway make-outsMaybe you’re into the drama and spontaneity of the pushed-up-against-the-wall thing, but the dorm hallway (and stairwell? You’d be surprised how many times we’ve seen it…) is not the place. You have a room in the building. So when we tell you to “get a room,” there really is no excuse.
Under the seminar tableWe see you. We know you thought it was sly when you two were holding hands (and thighs?) under the seminar table. But we all saw. And it was distracting, and plain disrespectful to your single classmates who have a date with their seminar reading tonight.
So Happy Valentine’s Day! Spread the love and avoid these blatant moments of PDA. Otherwise, be prepared for your lonely friends to say: dude, that’s rude.

Welcome to this semester’s first date recap for Flyby Matchmaker. With Valentine’s Day quite literally around the corner (t-minus one hour), here’s to hoping we can spread the love a little bit.
Milan Sani is a freshmen from Port Washington, N.Y. She said she finds funny, intellectual and artsy men attractive, but doesn’t care much for athletes. Gunnar Plunkett, also a freshmen, hails from Murrieta, CA and was “really into” cross-country in high school. He enjoys listening to alternative, indie, blues, and classic rock. Milan and Gunnar recap their Matchmaker date, which took place at the Harvard Art Museums (a really neat location to hang out and maybe find love) below:
Milan: My roommate put the link in our group chat and so we all filled it out together one night… We did it on a whim.
Gunnar: My friend from my FOP group told everyone to do this. And I was like, I might as well. Seemed a little more comprehensive than Datamatch…
Milan: I got to [Jenny’s Café at the Harvard Art Museums] and I saw so many different guys just by themselves. So I was writing my roommate group chat, “guys I don’t know what to do.”
Gunnar: I walked up to the museum and I was trying to figure out where the café was and I made eye contact with… I think it was her. But I thought “this isn’t the café so it’s not her.” So I went to the café.
Milan: I saw this guy… and he was kind of roaming around. And I saw him go into the art museum and then walk into the café and I [thought] OK, I think that’s him. And so I walked over to him… and was like “are you here for flyby?” I was the one to approach him.
Gunnar: First impression was that she was cute and that she seemed really friendly.
Milan: He was really warm the whole time and not awkward, so I was just kind of like “hey what’s up?” I think we were both equally like, what’s happening?
Gunnar: We didn’t hug; we just kind of said hi.
Milan: I just got a coffee and he got a cookie and coffee. We just sat down and talked and we both went through our applications… like a “why are we matched?” kind of thing.
Gunnar: There was a question about what you would change about Harvard and I said I would want her answer to be ‘nothing at all’ or something very specific. She said something very specific about the social scene.
Milan: We had very similar music tastes, like same bands. And we both had a floating interest in literature and he kind of likes Shakespeare. I’m super into Shakespeare. We had totally different academic interests.
Gunnar: I thought it was interesting that she was really into art. Also, I thought she had a cool interest in government and women’s studies as well.
Milan: After we talked for a bit… we walked through the art museum. I’d been there before but he’d never been so I took him around…We [looked at] everything on the first floor. He was really interested in it, which was cool…. He had a radio show [though] so he had to head out.
Gunnar: At the end when we were saying goodbye to each other… both of us were like “should we hug each other?” and that lasted like thirty seconds and we didn’t end up hugging. So that was awkward.
Milan: We friended each other on Facebook, so there’s that.
Gunnar: We were messaging on Facebook a little bit yesterday. We’re going to grab coffee.
