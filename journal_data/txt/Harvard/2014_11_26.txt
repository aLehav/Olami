After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nothing I have seen in recent memory is more heartbreaking than watching Michael Brown’s mother overcome with the realization that her son will not be getting any justice. Brown’s untimely death is the kind of tragedy that leaves you without words, and the kind that makes you sure any words you can find—to say, to post on Facebook, to tweet, to Instagram—will not be enough.
How do we start to make sense of this senseless tragedy? In the aftermath of the grand jury’s decision, people have looked to the details of the case—of which there are many—in order to process the implications of Michael Brown’s death and the lack of an indictment for Darren Wilson. But focusing on the technicalities of a grand jury proceeding masks the hard and fast truth underlying events in Ferguson. Here’s what happened, plain and simple: Another unarmed black teenager was shot by a white police officer.
The minutia of the evidence presented by the county prosecutor Robert McCulloch, I think, is irrelevant to our understanding of Brown’s significance in American society. Lost in the mountains of papers and photographs is the basic fact of Brown’s human value. Nobody in his or her right mind would suggest that Brown deserved the fate Officer Wilson handed him. Brown was slain, and no amount of political or legal maneuvering will change that simple, tragic fact.
Questions about the truth of Officer Wilson’s claim that he felt his life was in danger, or the nature of the altercation he and Brown had in his car, lead us down a path that does not ask or answer any of the right questions. This is what we should be asking: What is the nature and purpose of a system that has taken and continues to take the lives countless black men? That question, along with the terrifying fact that black men are 21 times more likely to be fatally shot by the police than white men, is impossible to answer or comprehend.
And the impossibility of comprehension runs rife throughout Brown’s case. Consciously or unconsciously, people everywhere are trying to reconcile Brown’s death with the ideals of American democracy. But Brown’s death wasn’t an unfortunate consequence of impartial law; it was the result of a police system that sees black lives as collateral damage, and blacks as somewhere below the status of full human beings.
Many shirk from confronting the reality that the odds are stacked against people of color in this country. If we acknowledge that the system failed Brown, and every other unarmed black male shot down by our police officers, then we must acknowledge that the system is broken. And a broken system for black men is a broken system for everyone, no matter the color of your skin. Accepting the compromised state of the democratic ideals about equality and non-discrimination we hold so dear is deeply disturbing. It shatters our faith in everything on which our country was founded. But it’s also the truth.
Let’s not forget: Brown’s teachers described him as a “gentle giant.” He graduated from high school just eight days before his premature death. Put yourselves in the shoes of Lesley McSpadden, Michael Brown’s mother, for just one moment. That feeling is what this system has wrought.
Black lives do matter. And until the American justice system holds that truth to be self-evident, the democracy we are living in is no democracy at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 30, 2014, at 9:15 p.m.
Computer Science 50 will officially expand to Yale in the fall of 2015, the popular introductory course’s instructor, David J. Malan ’99, confirmed this week.
Harvard’s approval was the final step necessary for a joint Harvard-Yale CS50 venture, which was first reported in The Crimson in October and approved by Yale faculty in early November.
Yale students will be able to watch CS50 lectures streamed live or as archived videos, with sections and office hours taking place in New Haven, Malan said during a course lecture on Monday. In addition, Malan wrote  in an email to The Crimson that Yale will recruit a team of teaching fellows and course assistants to aid Yale computer science professor Brian Scassellati in creating a course with a similar structure to that on Harvard’s campus.
Jason C. Hirschhorn ’14-’15 will take on a full-time position at Yale to oversee the course alongside Scassellati, Malan wrote.
According to Hirschhorn, Malan approached him a few months ago when conversations between Malan and Yale Computer Science Department Chair Joan Feigenbaum ’81 about a joint course were just beginning. Though Hirschhorn said “details are still being worked out,” students at Yale can expect a similar version of CS50 implemented on their campus.
“I certainly hope that people in New Haven are as excited about the course as people in Cambridge,” Hirschhorn said. “We don’t know what exactly [the interest] is going to look like.”
The CS50 employment website currently does not list any open positions in New Haven, though the course website’s front page advertises potential opportunities to “join the staff” of CS50 in Cambridge or New Haven.
Yale students will also be invited to partake in CS50’s annual Puzzle Day in September and its hackathon in December. Malan wrote he anticipates  “epic” CS50 fairs at the end of the fall 2015 semester displaying Yale and Harvard students’ work.
Yale faculty had already “overwhelmingly” approved of a joint Harvard-Yale Cs50 venture at a meeting in early November, according to Feigenbaum, leaving the proposal in the hands of Harvard’s faculty to approve. According to Feigenbaum, Malan first emailed her over the summer to propose the joint course.
Malan had previously declined to give specifics about the proposal.
CS50’s website’s color scheme has now changed from its regular bright pastels to Harvard- and Yale-inspired reds and blues. The website also features a Youtube video titled “Movin’ Right Along,” in which two muppets—one clad in a red CS50 t-shirt—drive from Harvard Yard to Yale’s campus.
The announcement of the new venture comes just days after the 131st Harvard-Yale football game, which Harvard clinched with a final score of 31-24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior wing Wesley Saunders had 24 points and 10 rebounds as the Harvard men’s basketball team defeated the visiting Houston Cougars, 84-63, for the hosts’ 52nd win in its last 55 home contests. The Crimson held the Cougars to just 33.3 percent shooting from the field while making just under 53 percent of its own attempts, including 46 percent of its threes.
“I was really pleased with our defensive effort and intensity,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Against a team that’s very athletic and good at creating in transition, I loved how we played in transition throughout the game…. I thought everyone that played really bought into that [defensive effort], knowing that would be the key for us.”
Harvard (3-1) spread the wealth on offense, with four players finishing in double digits. Sophomore Corbin Miller had his best performance of the season, knocking down four threes in 13 minutes of action to help the Crimson spread the floor. Overall, Harvard had 15 assists on 28 baskets as Saunders and junior co-captain Siyani Chambers (nine combined assists) found wide-open shooter after wide-open shooter on the perimeter.
“A lot of times when I’m driving the lane [the Cougars] like to collapse, and that’s when I try to kick it out to the shooters,” Saunders said. “I don’t get the ball with anything in mind, just react to the defense.”
The Crimson suffocated Houston (2-1) from the start, holding the Cougars without a field goal for the first seven minutes of the game and quickly building a 10-point lead. Houston broke through on a Jherrod Stiggers trey and warmed up quickly, sinking three more deep balls in the next three minutes to close the 10-point deficit to seven.
Overall, the Cougars lived and died by the three, putting forth a shot chart reminiscent of the NBA squad of the same name. Houston, which took 25 threes on the day, took nearly all of its shots behind the arc or in the paint. The Cougars often took treys with 20 to 25 seconds left on the shot clock, firing away before the Crimson could set its defense.
“They’re a dangerous, lethal team when they are in transition,” Amaker said. “When we made some bad shots or we turned it over it becomes a track meet for them at the other end. We talked about how limiting the mistakes on the offensive end for us would hopefully keep them out of transition.”
The prime beneficiary was guard Eric Weary Jr., who led the team with 19 points—including 14 in the first half. Weary Jr. sunk nearly everything he put up in the first half, including both of his threes, but struggled when Amaker placed Saunders on him, going just two-of-seven in the second.
On the other end, Saunders continued his season-long offensive tear. After the Cougars closed to within six near the end of the first half, Saunders had his fingerprints all over the 17-6 second-half stretch that put the game away, showing every asset in his multidimensional game.
First came the pair of streaking layups, drawing contact and finishing at the rim to jump-start a personal 5-0 run that pushed the lead to 14 just 40 seconds into the period. After Houston called time out, Saunders hounded Stiggers into a miss and corralled the rebound—one of three defensive possessions he closed out with a rebound in the next two minutes.
Later he played the role of facilitator, driving on consecutive possessions before whipping passes to wide-open shooters. The run put Harvard up by 20, and Houston never got the lead down to single digits the rest of the way.
Afterwards, Amaker was effusive with his praise of Saunders, who has drawn comparisons to Crimson greats throughout the first four games of the season. The wing is the first Harvard player to lead his team in scoring for four consecutive games since Jeremy Lin ’10 and the first to record three double-doubles in the season’s first four games since Keith Wright ’12.
“I think he’s got a chance to go down … he could be as decorated as any player who has ever played at Harvard,” Amaker said. “That’s saying something.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the marathon that was the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Tournament, Harvard started strong and finished stronger, with two last-minute victories giving it a winning tournament record.
Coming off a last-second one-point loss to Boston University the previous week, the Crimson (3-2) was determined to make any close game a victory.
HARVARD 79, HOLY CROSS 76
Harvard made its last performance a dramatic one, slating a winning tournament record with its 79-76 overtime win over Holy Cross (0-6).
Throughout the first minutes, it looked like the Crimson was going to have a handed win. Junior forward AnnMarie Healy dominated the first half, scoring 15 points to lead the team. The Crusaders trailed the entire half but could not surmount Harvard’s lead. At halftime, the Crimson led, 36-27.
Like the tournament’s two previous games, the second half provided a close contest. Holy Cross tied up the score, 58-58, with five minutes left. The waning moments of the game saw five three-pointers, two from Harvard’s senior point guard Ali Curtis. Curtis made her presence known in the second half, finishing the game with 22 points and six rebounds.
The last five seconds of the competition saw a trey from Holy Cross sophomore guard Kate Gillespie, to tie the game, 69-69. After three full back-to-back contests, this game was going to overtime.
“We always say that fatigue is a mental state not a physical one,” Curtis said. “We had to mentally prepare and overcome.”
Overtime saw the lead repeatedly switch multiple times. Gillespie netted another three pointer to give the Crusaders a lead with less than a minute left in the game. However, co-captain Erin McDonnell put up her fifth three-pointer of the game, and senior forward Temi Fagbenle made two free throws to solidify the Crimson’s win.
“With an overtime after a full game, it wasn’t easy,” co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “It was definitely our will and determination.”
NOTRE DAME 97, HARVARD 43
Tournament host Notre Dame (6-0) upheld its national No. 2 ranking on Monday night, defeating Harvard, 97-43.
The Crimson had a brief lead in the game’s opening minutes. McDonnell showed no fatigue from her performance the night before, putting up a jump shot and three-pointer. By the end of the game, McDonnell had registered double-digits for the second time in the tournament, leading the team with 10 points and six rebounds.
“We came into it knowing this is a fight, and we are the underdogs,” Dinkins said. “We gave it everything we could.”
Notre Dame spent the first half’s final 13 minutes outscoring the Crimson, 50-4.
However, trailing after halftime, 59-13, the Crimson rallied, giving the Fighting Irish an opponent it would have to fight against. Harvard more than doubled its shooting percentage from 17.2 percent to 40 percent, netting 30 points in the second half.
Even with this effort, Notre Dame continued to dominate, with five different players putting up double figures. Sophomore forward Taya Reimer led the host, scoring 14 points. This performance is nothing new for the Fighting Irish, which has beaten three teams by 54 or more points in this year’s undefeated campaign.
Ultimately, the Crimson was unable to catch up to Notre Dame, and it would have to enter day three of the Hall of Fame Challenge with a 1-1 record.
“It didn’t result in a win, but we learned a lot from that game [against Notre Dame],” Dinkins said. “When we have games like that [in the future], it will have a different outcome.”
HARVARD 87, QUINNIPIAC 83
In the first game of the tournament, Harvard took on Quinnipiac (3-2), beating the Bobcats, 87-83.
The close score fails to indicate the impressive performances made by forwards Fagbenle, McDonnell, and Healy. Fagbenle’s 28 points and 11 rebounds, McDonnell’s 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Healy’s 18 points and 11 rebounds marked the first time a Crimson trio has notched double-doubles since 2000.
“Those three players having double-doubles—that’s just will,” Dinkins said. “They knew that they needed to do that to win and that was really just sacrificing and doing it for our team.”
The game started when Fagbenle’s jumpshot found the net 20 seconds in. Both teams continued to put up points, and Harvard began increasing the lead on Quinnipiac.  Scoring 12 consecutive points, the Crimson was up, 18-6, five minutes into the game.
As the first half continued, the Bobcats managed to bring the score to a two-point margin, despite not being able to close it. As the buzzer sounded, Quinnipiac trailed Harvard, 37-41.
The second half proved a more heated contest, with a seemingly transformed Bobcat team taking the court. Quinnipiac quickly overtook the Crimson for the first time in the game.
The competition became even closer in the last 10 minutes. The neck-and-neck battle lasted until the last two minutes, when Fagbenle sunk a three-pointer and a free-throw, giving Harvard a one-point lead that the Crimson would not relinquish.
“It was that mental state of knowing that we’re there for each other and [that] we had to play as a team to pull out the win,” Curtis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The season began less than two weeks ago, and yet one storyline has already become old news for the Harvard men’s basketball team. On Tuesday night, senior wing Wesley Saunders once again shouldered the offensive burden for the Crimson, carrying it to its 26th home win in 27 attempts, a streak dating back to December 2012. After senior center Kenyatta Smith laid in a basket 21 seconds in the contest, Harvard did not trail for the duration of the game, ultimately earning the 84-63 win over Houston.
The Crimson went to its wingman early and often against the Cougars (2-1), and Saunders responded with a performance that coach Tommy Amaker called “tremendous.” The senior had a hand in 43 percent of Harvard’s made field goals, ending the night with 24 points, 10 rebounds, and four dimes.
While Saunders tallied 12 points in the first half, it was his offensive spurt to begin the second period that broke the game wide open.
On the first play of the second period, with Harvard (3-1) holding a 43-34 lead, Saunders threw the rock to co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi, who was waiting near the first hash mark. Saunders immediately slashed to the paint along the right baseline, and Moundou-Missi found him under the basket. The wing laid in the ball, finishing the back-end of the give-and-go and drawing contact on the play. Moments later, Saunders drained the free throw.
On the next Harvard possession, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers connected with Saunders on the break. Saunders put the ball on the floor just once between the three-point line and the basket, and rolled in the layup.
Thirty-eight seconds had elapsed in the second half, and Saunders had already added five points to his halftime mark.
Minutes later, Saunders knocked in a pair from the charity stripe. Then he collected a rebound, brought the ball up the floor, penetrated into the paint, and found sophomore Corbin Miller floating on the right wing. Saunders passed, Miller shot, and Harvard went up, 60-40.
In the eight minutes that had passed since intermission, the senior had outscored the entirety of the Houston team, 7-6.
“In the locker room, Coach told us we wanted to get out to a good start the first four minutes [of the second period],” Saunders explained. “So we just wanted to come out with a lot of energy and try to separate us from them, which I don’t think we were able to do in the first half.”
MIRROR IMAGE
Fittingly, it was the Cougar player wearing the same jersey number as Saunders that led the visiting team’s efforts on Tuesday night. Junior Eric Weary Jr., who came off the bench at the 14:37 mark of the first half, put up a team-high 19 points, shooting the ball at a 53 percent clip. No one else on Houston managed to shoot over 40 percent.
The 6’4” guard had 14 points in the 15 minutes he played before intermission, converting everything from treys to put-backs. Weary’s baskets in the first half were bookended by two threes from the left wing, at the 11:58 and 00:55 marks of the period, and the junior connected on a lefty layup following a quick, slicing backdoor cut, two put-backs, and a couple of free throws in between the treys.
“He’s an active player,” Amaker said. “He got on the offensive glass, made things happen, and was very aggressive.”
It was a battle of the No. 23’s, and while Saunders’s squad may have come out on top, for much of the first period the two playmakers were essentially trading baskets, with Weary outscoring the senior, 14-8, from the moment he checked into the game until the halftime buzzer rang.
ROLE TIDE
While Harvard was led by the guy that Amaker has deemed “the best player” on the team, Saunders found consistent support from the role players that surrounded him, both on the perimeter and in the paint.
Moundou-Missi and Miller, particularly, gelled with Saunders on the court on Tuesday. While No. 14 Moundou-Missi had 14 points and 14 rebounds, the sophomore gunner drained four of the six three-pointers he attempted, totaling 12 points on the night.
For Miller, Tuesday’s contest looked as if it were the first time since returning from his two-year mission that he was truly in his shooting rhythm. And with the clock running down in the first period, he showcased the form that led him to be known as a sharpshooter three seasons ago.
With 20 seconds to play before intermission, Chambers held the ball near the half-court circle. The point guard handed off the rock to Saunders on the right wing, who missed a contested shot with just ticks remaining on the clock. Moundou-Missi was able to tip the rebound out to Chambers, who immediately sent it to Miller. The sophomore had been waiting on the right wing and didn’t hesitate to release the ball as soon as it touched his fingers. He let it go just in time, and the ball was still in the air when the halftime buzzer rang.
“I thought that [shot] was big,” Amaker said. “That [led to] a momentum change…[to] momentum switching to our side.”
Moundou-Missi also made noise by hitting timely shots. After the Cougars had scored consecutive buckets to cut the Crimson’s lead to 11, Moundou-Missi matched his opponents by knocking in two straight baskets of his own. With 15:30 remaining in the game, Saunders drove on the baseline and found Moundou-Missi waiting in the opposite corner, about 17 feet from the hoop. Showcasing a deeper range than normal, the forward proceeded to sink the long jumper.
Then, on just the following possession, Moundou-Missi slipped behind Houston’s 6’10” big man Danrad Knowles to collect an offensive rebound, stuffing the ball home without ever touching the floor.
“I think when you think of Steve’s growth throughout his time here, I think of confidence,” Amaker said. “He’s playing like a senior…[and that’s] very encouraging.”
The Cougars didn’t come closer than 14 points the rest of the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday night, the only thing standing between Jimmy Vesey and an overtime victory over the top team in the nation was the goaltender.
Streaking up the middle of the ice, the junior forward came inches from lifting the No. 18 Harvard men’s ice hockey team over No. 1 Boston University at Agganis Arena, only to have his breakaway attempt sent aside by Terrier goaltender Matt O’Connor.
But Vesey would not be denied. Just minutes later, the forward dished a pass to junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo in front of the net, who muscled a shot past O’Connor to complete the upset for the Crimson (6-1-2, 3-1-2 ECAC) by a score of 3-2.
“Our guys dug deep towards the end there,” Harvard coach Ted Donato said. “I thought in the overtime, the attitude on the bench was great. I thought our guys really tried to dig deep and go after it.”
After Boston University (8-2-1, 6-1-1 Hockey East) created some chances of its own in the extra frame, the Crimson found its response after junior defenseman Patrick McNally pushed the puck ahead to Vesey behind the goal.
Calling for the puck, Criscuolo darted towards the crease, taking the pass from Vesey and squeezing it past O’Connor to seal the victory.
The goal was one of two on the night for Criscuolo, as Harvard’s top line accounted for all of its offense against the Terriers. Sophomore forward Alex Kerfoot notched two assists, while Vesey—a Mass. native—had a goal and an assist against the team’s crosstown rival.
“We’re just thrilled about the win,” Criscuolo said. “[We have] a ton of guys from Boston, so it’s a huge game when you play Boston University. And with them at No. 1, it’s even a bigger game coming in here.”
The first goal of the night for the co-captain gave the Crimson its first lead with just under two minutes remaining in the second period.
With Harvard on the man advantage, Criscuolo took a pass from McNally at the top of the left circle and unleashed a slap shot towards goal. With traffic in front of the net, the puck soared over the right shoulder of O’Connor, giving the forward his ninth straight game with a point.
The Crimson carried that lead into the final frame, but the Terriers found an equalizer 6:43 into the period.
Moving up ice in transition, BU defenseman Brandon Hickey delivered a pass to junior forward Ahti Oksanen on his left. From the top of the left circle, the junior threw a low wrist shot on net that caught Harvard goaltender Stephen Michalek off guard, evening the score at two goals apiece.
That, however, would be the only real mistake Michalek would make all game long, as the junior netminder finished the contest with 40 saves. Over the last four games, Michalek has made 130 saves, allowing just four goals during that span.
The goalie set the tone right out of the gate, stopping all 13 shots that came his way in the first period, including a quick wrist shot by the nation’s leading point-getter—freshman forward Jack Eichel.
Eichel, who entered the contest with seven goals and 12 assists through 10 games, was held without a point for the first time all season.
Donato joked that to keep the forward off the board, he had been carrying a rosary bead in his coat pocket.
“It certainly didn’t feel like he didn’t have any points tonight because he’s dynamic,” Donato said. “[With] his skill level [and] his ability to control the tempo of the game, he’s a tough matchup.”
While trying to contain Eichel and the rest of BU’s top line, the Crimson struggled offensively in the opening period. Harvard totaled just five shots on net in the frame—the first of which did not come until almost nine minutes into the contest.
Nonetheless, the Crimson emerged from the locker room at the start of the second period looking like a different group. Harvard recorded 11 shots on target in the stanza, earning its first score of the game at the 11:46 mark courtesy of Vesey.
Trailing 1-0 following a goal by Terrier forward Matt Lane, the Crimson lined up for a faceoff in the attacking zone. After winning the draw, Kerfoot got the puck to Vesey coming off the right wing, who made his way to the crease and poked a shot past O’Connor.
With the victory, Harvard has knocked off two top-ranked teams in the last three seasons, as the Crimson defeated No. 1 Quinnipiac in overtime in 2013. Dating back to that same season, Harvard has also now won its last five games against BU.
“For us, we were trying to make a statement to ourselves,” Donato said. “I think BU is very worthy and will be a great team throughout the rest of the year. But I think our guys are really trying to get ourselves established. And we knew that [this] was a good opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than two minutes remaining in overtime of Tuesday night’s contest at Agganis Arena, Kyle Criscuolo muscled for a pass on the left side of the crease.
His first swipe at the puck sent it into the air. His next swipe sent it into the net.
With the junior co-captain’s second goal of the game, the No. 18 Harvard men’s ice hockey team (6-1-2, 3-1-2 ECAC) stunned No. 1 Boston University (9-2-1, 6-1-1 HEA) on the road in overtime, 3-2.
The game was the Terriers’ first since displacing Michigan Tech as the top-ranked team in the country. For most of Tuesday night, the hosts looked the part. Terriers coach David Quinn praised his squad following the team’s first overtime loss of the season.
“From start to finish, I thought that was as thorough a game as we’ve played in awhile,” Quinn said. “I thought we played better tonight than we did [in wins last weekend] against Maine and UConn. It’s a funny game.”
BU controlled the first and third periods and outshot the Crimson, 42-24. Another standout performance from junior goaltender Steve Michalek kept Harvard alive, and the team’s top scorers provided offensive sparks at key moments.
Terrier freshman center and top draft prospect Jack Eichel buzzed around Michalek all night but was held pointless for the first time in his college career. The Crimson, meanwhile, collected its fifth consecutive win over BU.
BEST OF THE BEST
After the Crimson upset of then-No. 8 Boston College on Veterans’ Day, Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 provided a simple observation: “Our best players were our best players.”
Two weeks later, the same held true as Harvard claimed another victory in the house of a Beanpot rival. Harvard’s top four scorers—first line forwards Alex Kerfoot, Jimmy Vesey, Kyle Criscuolo, and junior defenseman Patrick McNally—were on the ice for all three of the team’s goals on Tuesday.
Each skater had an important hand in the overtime winner.
Kerfoot skated circles around defenders in the BU zone before cycling the puck to a teammate.
McNally kept the puck under the blueline and pushed it along the boards behind the net to Vesey.
Vesey flipped it back to Criscuolo.
Criscuolo took a couple of whacks in front of the crease.
That was the game.
The most compelling match-up of the night was between the two teams’ first lines.
BU’s top combination of junior Danny O’Regan, Eichel, and junior Ahti Oksanen—the “OREO” line—had accounted for 42 percent of their team’s scoring before Tuesday. Against Harvard, Oksanen’s eighth goal of the season allowed BU to draw even in the third period.
Harvard’s first line currently lacks a nickname yet out-produced its counterpart, sandwiching the OREO line with a couple of Criscuolo classics. Criscuolo, who now has five goals and 12 points on the season, has thrived on the ice with his new linemates. All three rank in the top 15 in points per game.
“When you’re playing with two guys as creative and potent as Jimmy Vesey and Alex Kerfoot, a lot of things are going to happen,” Criscuolo said. “I think it’s kind of just a mix of work and heart and realizing that our success comes a lot from getting pucks in deep and then using our skill down low.”
McNally, meanwhile, has emerged as one of the greatest scoring threats in the country among defensemen. With his two assists on Tuesday, McNally vaulted into a tie for most points scored by Division I defenders and leads the nation outright in points per game.
IN AND OUT
Victor Newell appeared in the Crimson’s line up for the first time this season. The sophomore defender from British Columbia skated alongside junior co-captain Max Everson on the second defensive pairing.
Last season, Newell missed most of the first three months of the season but impressed in the 16 games in which he appeared. The rookie led all Harvard blueliners in scoring with 10 points.
On Tuesday night, Newell returned in fine form. Thirty seconds into overtime, he set up Vesey on a breakaway that nearly clinched the game minutes before Criscuolo’s decisive strike. On the defensive end, the sophomore helped keep Eichel off the scoresheet for the first time this season.
“It’s not easy to play your first game and see No. 9 coming at you at 300 miles per hour,” Donato said. “I thought [Newell] played very well.”
While Newell’s return is a plus for the Crimson, the team is still waiting to return to full strength.
After making his own return against Bentley last Friday, Colin Blackwell was a scratch on Tuesday.  The drafted junior forward missed all of last year because of post-concussion trauma.
“We’re hoping that he gets healthy,” Donato said of Blackwell.
Harvard is also waiting to suit up sophomore center Sean Malone, the reigning co-Ivy League Rookie of the Year, in addition to junior forward Greg Gozzo and sophomore defenseman Kevin Guiltinan.

One thing I’ve learned here is that when people talk about “The Game,” they’re not necessarily referring to The Actual Game of American Football Between Harvard And Yale. Most of the time, “The Game” actually means tailgate antics, half-time pranks, and ridiculously hilarious signs.
Saturday, November 22 marked the 131st incarnation of The Harvard-Yale Game. This year in particular has been rife with practical jokes and Facebook wars, ranging from On Harvard Time’s newest “Harvard Pranks Yale” video and Yale’s uncomfortable video responses to the notorious Harvard-Yale mock debate during which current Yale student body president Michael Herbert made a surprise, visor-clad appearance.
Ultimately, Harvard reinstated tradition and won out against Yale with a final score of 31-24 (so close, Yale, so close), clinching both a H-Y victory and the Ivy League Champion title for the eighth consecutive time, which according to ESPN is the first time either school has won that many times since the 1880s.
Here are some overheard conversation highlights from The Game 2014, an afternoon of blue skies, freezing winds, and sweet, sweet, victory.
In response to Yale’s spontaneous stripping spectacle mid-way through the Game:“The Yale kids are so done that they’d rather be naked than in Yale gear.”
(Shunella G. Lumas ’15)
Upon the Harvard University Band’s entrance onto the field:“HEY YOU! YOU WITH THE CLARINET! THAT’S A NICE CLARINET YOU GOT THERE!”“YOU PLAY THAT F---ING OBOE!”They did.
(Melanie Y. F ’18)
“F--- STANFORD!”“Hey!”“What?“That was my top school.”Girl. Girl.
During the game, students discussed the relative dangers of football and other sports.“You know what’s really intense? Ping pong.”“No, no, full-contact chess.”“No—wizard’s chess!”I’m not sure if we want to know what full-contact chess is. But you know what they say about wizard’s chess.
New love seemed to blossom at the game.“Obama?”“Obama.”Maybe “Obama” will be our “Always”.
The appearance of several large sticks with a certain face printed on them led an elderly alumnus to ask, with heightening panic:“Who is the head guy? Who is he? Do you know?”???
(Melanie Y. Fu ’18)
During the raucous post-victory field-storming:“Oh my god, let’s take a picture!... Oh my god, I’m bleeding.”Oh my god, are you okay.
Students were deep in thought as they walked out of the stadium in the rosy pink sunset.“I wonder how it feels to be second all the time.”What a thought. 
The moral of the story:“Now I know why everyone likes athletes… They’re so cool.”Love you too, bro.
Until next time, Yale!
