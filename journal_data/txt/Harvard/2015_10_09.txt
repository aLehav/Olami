After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The epigraph of Margaret Atwood’s “The Heart Goes Last” consists of quotes from three texts: “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Pygmalion and Galatea,” and “I Had Sex with Furniture.” At first glance, these three works seem unrelated. However, the three together effectively encompass the themes of Atwood’s novel: control, yearning, and detachment. Atwood effectively develops ambiguous characters who alternate among each of these three moods, as they frequently change their moral positions and respond to difficult situations in ways that can be equally understandable and disagreeable. By morphing the narrator’s voice to take after a given character’s, Atwood often encourages empathy in the reader. However, having to identify with the same person in so many different states, to switch between different characters, and to keep pace with the many parallel flip-flops in plot revelations, can leave the reader to feel much like the ending sentence of the novel: still in doubt.
The novel’s world is drenched in uncertainty, a quality which Atwood also skillfully develops within her characters’ internal contradictions. The most significant of these characters are a seemingly typical married couple, Charmaine and Stan, who happen to live in their third-hand Honda in a barren Western landscape of the near future. Society’s crumbling economic and social orders have left once-content people, now with no resources or laws, to fend for themselves. As a result, to say the least, Stan and Charmaine’s marriage is constantly on edge. In a move to survive Charmaine convinces Stan to join the Positron Project—a dubious utopian experiment—but after joining they are each swept up in their animal instincts, sexually drawn to others, and unable to point fingers at villains or applaud for heroes. Charmaine, the former housewife, takes on a secret job as the Project’s hospital executioner, finding her comfort in the comfort she offers her victims. Stan initially seems like a hero, but by showing Stan’s ridiculous plans to have an affair, Atwood also reveals how the morally upright hero can bend his principles.
The brilliantly presented climax of the novel exemplifies Atwood’s skill at conveying the harrowing idea that when society deteriorates, the most ordinary people are driven to unimaginable lengths. When Charmaine goes into the hospital room at this moment, she is informed by “the head” that her loyalty will be tested depending on whether or not she can carry out “the Procedure.” As the executioner, she is left confused. It isn’t until she slips on her gloves and steps over to the gurney that she realizes that her husband is the one who she is tasked to kill. Despite her love for Stan, from fear of punishment she slides the needle into his neck. In this scene, Atwood powerfully displays Charmaine’s feelings of helplessness, guilt, and desperation: “She strokes Stan’s head. ‘Shhh,’ she says to him. ‘It’s okay.’ She always strokes their heads, but this time it’s not any old head, it’s Stan’s head, with his bristly haircut.” Atwood’s sharp tone and wit are complemented by her ability to include vivid but simple details to ground the story. At its best, her prose can make even characters as unsettling as Charmaine relatable.
Unfortunately, however, because Atwood makes finding a hero so difficult, her accumulating plot twists can become tiresome and confusing. Some characters switch sides in their loyalties and are difficult to sympathize with consistently. The writing becomes especially disordered and fractured when Atwood shows Charmaine attempting to keep track of who is with or against her: “You promised, you promised, Charmaine wants to say. It must have been the water, something Jocelyn put in. Oh heck! You lying witch! But she can’t get the words out. Her tongue feels thick, her eyes are closing. Her whole body leaning sideways.” In addition, Atwood introduces a blue teddy bear fetish and prostitution robots, and while she keeps reinventing perceptions of her women and men with each added detail, it becomes a great challenge to keep a solid hold on the novel’s reality.
Nevertheless, “The Heart Goes Last,” amidst its tiring plot twists, is a captivating read. At the novel’s end, Charmaine is surprised by a visitor who forces her to come to terms with her own agency. “You prefer compulsion? Gun to the head, so to speak?...You want your decisions taken away from you so you won’t be responsible for your own actions?” This question is only met with another question, an apt illustration of the sort of novel this is. Its moral standards are unclear, but when Atwood is successful, “The Heart Goes Last” brings shameful thoughts, the things kept hidden, to the surface for illumination and redemption.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman year is a turbulent time. The sheer number of new opportunities and obligations is, to a degree, overwhelming for everyone. But student testimonies and the student body’s vote to fund a “Freshman Enrichment Program” last year demonstrate that many new students, especially those matriculating from public schools and abroad, feel as though they are entering the college disadvantaged—socially, economically, and academically.
No accepted student should feel inherently unprepared for the first year at Harvard. First-year students often find themselves overburdened with coursework and extracurricular activities and unaware of the College’s resources. A bridge program or enrichment program that aims to make the academic and social transition to college easier is welcome and necessary.
An enrichment program of this sort should not, however, prevent a student from participating in the existing pre-orientation programs—namely the First-Year International Program, the Freshman Arts Program, Fall Clean-Up, the First-Year Outdoor Program, and the First-Year Urban Program. These pre-orientation programs help to ease the social transition to college by forming close communities early in the academic year. In order to be most effective, the Freshmen Enrichment Program should either be available to students before the pre-orientation programs or be integrated into Opening Days programming.
One central challenge of such an enrichment program lies in the difficulty of avoiding stigma. While the primary goal of the enrichment initiative should be to bridge the academic and expectations gap between students from different backgrounds, the organizers should be careful not to let undue connotations of unpreparedness attach to the program. The enrichment program should be inclusive and free, available to any student—regardless of socioeconomic or educational background—who desires an introduction to social life, academic strategies, and on-campus organizations before they step foot in the Yard.
Stigma would be unavoidable if what might someday be called "FEP" were offered as an alternative to FIP, FAP, FCU, FOP, and FUP. Likewise, if the college encouraged certain students to enroll in FEP, or recommended the program based on some sort of evaluation, the program could establish an unhelpful division among students. The best policy is to make the enrichment program available to all students without compromising a student’s ability to participate in other social programs.
If the College addresses issues of stigmatization, FEP could be successful in preparing students for the academic and social scene in college. Freshmen would benefit greatly from seminars and discussions about time management skills accompanied by genuine student testimonies about work-life balance at Harvard. The program should also feature workshops and sessions on writing in various disciplines so as to acquaint students with the rigor of college writing.
In addition, presentations on the extra-curricular resources available to students should occur during FEP, possibly through sessions with the student groups themselves. Programming should also introduce students to Harvard’s social life and the resources available to help navigate it. Such information on campus resources, major social events, and other central aspects of student life would make it easier for all students to adjust to the Harvard community.
Finally, the proposed enrichment program must be able to establish itself among existing initiatives for first-year students. The College should make a comprehensive and compelling pitch to incoming students about the program so that every student understands its benefits and can make an informed decision about whether to attend. A program like FEP is long overdue; the College must ensure that flaws in conception and execution do not hamper its very real potential.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The streetlights on Mount Auburn popped on underneath a cloudy sunset sky on Monday night. I stopped on the sidewalk and took out an earbud, hoping that by devoting all of my senses to the pastel pinks above me, I could later remember what this felt like. I felt some sense of ownership over it all, a strange feeling of home.
I’ve been listening to the song “This Must Be The Place” by Talking Heads on repeat. In an attempt to be a cooler version of myself, I got into '80s music last semester. I hoped that the synths and big hair would somehow transmit into a more chill, skinny-jeaned Brianna.
“Home is where I want to be / but I guess I’m already there.” I walked back to Winthrop, passing the familiar brick-walled final clubs, willing the sunset to last for hours and hours. What does it mean to think of Harvard as home?
I swiped into Annenberg earlier this semester for the first time since freshman year. I don’t really know why, but looking up at the high ceilings, I almost cried. I remember what it meant to walk down rows of long tables, hoping to catch the eye of every attractive, high-achieving freshman classmate of mine as I took my mug up for more coffee. I remember the fear of dining alone among the stained glass and the chandeliers. Harvard wasn’t home back then.
“I feel numb, born with a weak heart / I guess I must be having fun.” This past Saturday was my birthday party. I wanted to surround myself with people that I liked on this campus—mostly people who were cool in that '80s sort of way, effortless in their nonchalance and thoroughly unfazed by the chaotic nature of this place. Of course, my closest friends and I don’t quite fit that description, but I wanted a celebration that embodied the low, throbbing synths and tight pants of an era that had passed before my own birth.
The room filled with people that I knew too well intermingling with people that I wanted to know better. I found myself hugging and dancing with almost-strangers, bonding over the cheesy playlist I had made, and hoping that they were having fun. It felt so good to be in a room of individuals who were connected by the fact that I had asked them to come. I saw freshmen walk through the door nervously, and I ran over to greet them. I remember walking into parties during my first year, at once fearful and exhilarated at the thought that an older student wanted to celebrate something with me around. I found myself sincerely thanking people for their presence at this party—it was probably weird to them, but I legitimately needed to say it. I felt loved—numbingly loved—in a way that I haven’t felt in a long time. My heart was overwhelmed.
“Feet on the ground, head in the sky / It’s okay, I know nothing’s wrong.” One of the most challenging things about this place is the shared feeling of solitude—the mutual aloneness. Last week in Winthrop dining hall, I sat one table away from a kid in one of my classes, each of us on a laptop, able to see each other over our screens, but avoiding eye contact or any acknowledgment that the other existed. I remember the first time that someone shared with me the words of Assata Shakur: “We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.” Then why is Harvard such a harsh place?
How am I supposed to feel at home in a place that was literally built by ancestors of mine in chains? How am I supposed to feel at home in a place where we share Crimson articles about mental health and compassion on Facebook, sitting across the room from each other and avoiding eye contact? How am I supposed to feel at home when this mixed girl doesn’t ever feel black enough or queer enough or anything enough to go to identity-based student organization meetings anymore? How have I managed, despite these things, to try to make Harvard my home?
“Home is where I want to be / Pick me up and turn me ‘round.” In one of my freshman classes, I learned that womens’ liberation groups used a tactic called consciousness raising, adapted from civil rights activists. Consciousness raising was a means of teaching feminists how to understand themselves individually in relation to the society they lived in. I want to do that with people here. I’m not being facetious when I say the cliché phrase, “Let’s grab a meal this week!” I actually mean it. Let’s build some kind of collective consciousness of ourselves and each other. Let’s build a home at Harvard.

Would you pay $790 for a pair of jeans? Dior believes that you might.
You’re on a budget? How about a pair of “sun bleached, destroyed” jeans from AG? For just $255, they’re yours!
Still too pricey? You want to drop as little cash as possible? You could try Levi’s, where you’ll spend $54.50, or Target, where jeans cost $10.48.
The Denim Disparity: I think about it often. Why is it that I could feed myself for a month for the cost of Dior’s cotton-pants-dyed-indigo? How can that product coexist in a market where Target sells something similar for just over 1 percent of that price? And where does AG fit into this equation? $300 is no small fee. But if I compare that price tag to Dior’s, it looks like I’m getting a good deal.
When I buy a pair of jeans—or any garment for that matter—what am I paying for? In other industries, more money usually buys better quality. But in fashion, parsing prices is perplexing.
Retail prices represent a multitude of completely qualitative variables, things like aesthetic appeal and brand name. Kanye West can design a sweatshirt that is nothing but “Japanese stretch French terry [cloth…washed] down to where it keeps its original qualities but then feels so thin,” and sell it for $560 because he conceived it and he’s Kanye. AG can charge $300 for their jeans because Kim Kardashian wears them. If Rihanna sports jeans with slashes on her knees, buyers willingly pay more to own the trend.
Labels like Dior have the added bonus of legacy on their side. A 70-year-old fixture in the luxury goods industry, Dior not only promises well-designed, beautifully made garments, but also serves as a badge of honor for wearers. When someone dons jeans with a Dior logo, they intentionally—albeit subtly—allude to their own wealth, prestige, and class.
But an expensive price tag isn’t necessarily an indication of unfair mark-ups and corporate cunning. Retail price also covers the material and labor costs incurred in producing a garment. When I see that Levi’s sells some of its jeans for over $50, I’m still worried and confused.
Here’s why. In the book “Women in Clothes,” journalist Julia Wallace interviews two Cambodian women who work in the Levi’s production factory. From their accounts, Levi’s grossly underpays its laborers. One, named Vantha, explains that if she gets “sick, then there is no money... The most sick leave we are ever granted is two days. Even then, we have to bring a doctor’s note proving we are getting medical treatment. It’s not easy to prove this, so usually our wages get deducted.”
The other, named Sophal, writes: “When I’m sewing seams, I always think that these jeans must be very expensive, they cost at least $40 to $50 per pair, and I’m wondering how those people afford those expensive jeans while my salary is so small. I sometimes wonder how I could ever afford them. They look beautiful, and I think how beautiful I would be if I wore them...Sometimes we feel like our hearts hurt.”
I would happily pay more for a pair of Levi’s jeans if I knew that the price reflected improved labor conditions and increased wages for their employees. But most haute-couture labels and mass-market brands are cagey when explaining their prices. And when a shopper walks into a Levi’s, Vantha and Sophal are not there to explain why the jeans are affordable.
So if you can’t afford to systematically avoid reasonably priced clothing stores, you’re stuck supporting stingy companies.
And this troubles me. Because shopping responsibly is already difficult. It shouldn’t also be a privilege reserved for the well-off or elitist.
Recently, a few shrewd entrepreneurs have identified this problem.  Everlane.com is a company that commits itself to complete transparency. When you buy one of their garments, you see a breakdown of its cost in terms of materials, hardware, labor, duties, transport, and their markup.
In Los Angeles, a start-up named DSTLD taps into the city’s extensive, well-established denim manufacturing industry to produce jeans responsibly and sell them for reasonable prices. As CEO Corey Epstein explains, “people have become more interested in sustainable and conscious consumption…[they want], fewer, better things from brands that speak to [them] stylistically.”
It’s true! I’m “people,” and that’s what I want. I’m willing to pay more than $30 for a pair of jeans if they’re made well. Heck, charge me more if you give me a wacky wash, quirky crop, or an aggressive knee-gash. But I want the fashion industry to make my affordable, attention-grabbing trousers humanely. Sustainably.
And if this proves too difficult, we can just ask Kanye for help. If he can get designers to rearrange their showtimes at New York Fashion Week, he can do anything.

The Very Bad Thing began with broken glass. Full to the brim with blue raspberry Rubinoff and wobbling through a sea of sweaty teenagers, I didn’t notice the shattered lamp on the floor in front of me until it sliced into my sole. Before that point, the party made me feel like I was doing high school right. Then I started bleeding.
Cue The Boy. He noticed me, drunk and woozy next to the staircase in the front hall, and sat me down on the steps. He left briefly and returned with a wet paper towel for my gash and a Band-Aid. He was a varsity athlete with an impressive reputation around school. I was grateful, flattered, and 16.
He held my hand and gestured me up the stairs. I trusted The Boy to take care of me, so I crawled up behind him. He led me into a bedroom and shut the door.
Without warning, he threw his mouth on my lips and my shirt on the ground. My arms felt numb and foreign as I tried to keep his hands off my bra clasp and my body. I was unsuccessful. I tried to push him, but my strength failed me. My “I don’t want to” was slurred and futile. As his hands reached my shorts, the door flew open. My friend and his girlfriend stumbled in, saw us, and apologized. I thanked them, grabbed my shirt, and tripped out the door.
The next morning, I found the friend who had interrupted The Very Bad Thing. I needed him to know that I didn’t want it to happen, and I felt sick that he might’ve thought—or worse, told—a version of the story that painted me as an eager participant.
I let the contents of The Very Bad Thing spill out of me, desperate for him to see it for what it was. He didn’t.
“No, don’t say stuff like that,” he said. “The Boy’s a good guy. You were both just drunk.”
This was a slap, and I felt The Thing seep back into me like poison. Shaking, I found my best friend and handed him The Very Bad Thing.
“It’s not a big deal,” he said. “The Boy’s a good guy.”
My friends grew angry with me for telling them, and when they begrudgingly passed on to The Boy why I didn’t want to be at parties with him, The Boy hated me. “For good reason,” my best friend said.  The Very Bad Thing ripped through my stomach and settled there for three years.
A few weeks ago, I sat in on an OSAPR workshop, and the two women who ran it made clear that many women at Harvard experience Bad Things and are told they aren’t serious or real. That night, I spoke to three people I love, and they each told me The Very Bad Thing Was Not Okay. “It Was a Big Deal,” they said. I cried as my stomach loosened and expelled The Very Bad Thing.
Last week, I handed my Bad Thing to another friend, and she handed me hers. This month last year, during a time known as The Red Zone for women, she was raped. She told A Boy that she did not want to have sex, and he responded with The Very Bad Thing. No one interrupted him. A few months later when she confronted The Boy, telling him she was still spiraling from what had happened, he responded with an answer that seemed designed to shield him from legal harm.
“I don’t think it was his first rodeo,” she said.
The other day, another friend got into an argument with her boyfriend. He shoved her to the ground and left. Scraped and bleeding, she asked his friends to help her. “He’s just stressed out,” they said. “The Boy’s a good guy” is what they meant. “Boys will be boys.”
According to Harvard’s Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, about 31 percent of undergraduate women are sexually assaulted by the time they graduate, and the numbers are even worse in the LGBQAN community. Only 16 percent of Harvard undergraduate women think the University would be very or extremely likely to take action against offenders. Roughly 75 percent of women who experience non-consensual penetration do not file a formal complaint. The report also noted, “the most frequently cited reason for not reporting [sexual assault] was the belief that it was not serious enough to report.”
About a third of respondents said they didn’t report because they felt nothing would be done in response.
I’m not surprised. Harvard—everywhere, right now—has a systemic problem. And it won’t be fixed by telling women to come forward. Publicly, everyone can agree that sexual assault and violence against women are abysmal. Large community conversations or newspaper statements encourage women to report, but the message that hits home most is heard in passing conversation, over dinner, at parties. Every “I don’t believe you,” every “she was drunk” or “he’s a good guy” or “boys will be boys” reaffirms the belief that men who do this always have an excuse, that the women who are forced to hold onto Very Bad Things have caused trouble.
The Boy is many men, and he will do it again, he will show others they can do it again, if we keep talking like this. If we want to fix this problem, our community must carry the burden of proof. We must take these stories at face value because the stakes are too high; the practices we will perpetuate otherwise are just too horrible. We need to show those around us that we will be different, that we will be the friends who listen, that The Boy never has a right to do this, that The Very Bad Thing is not okay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Monday, the Institute of Politics at Harvard held their first event in a pilot series for students entitled “Moments to Movements.” The series is billed as “a workshop on building strong and sustainable movements,” and the publicity email that was sent out to students was generally unremarkable, noting only that the panel would explore gun control as a case study.
Unremarkable, I should say, only if you have not memorized the names of former chairmen of the National Rifle Association.
If you have memorized those names, however, one name on the panel may have caught your eye. David Keene was the chairman of the NRA from 2011 to 2013. Notable events of these years include the 2012 presidential election, in which the NRA spent $19 million —and, in addition, the date of December 14th, 2012, when a gunman burst into Sandy Hook Elementary School and murdered 26 people, 20 of them children, with a semiautomatic rifle and semi-automatic pistols as backup.
I did not go to the event, nor did I talk to anyone who went, so I don’t know what was discussed.
But I do know that just about a week ago, a gunman entered a classroom on the campus of Umqua Community College in southern Oregon, opened fire, and killed ten people. I know that beyond the horrifically consistent stream of mass shootings, on an average day, 88 Americans are killed by gun violence. I know that more Americans have died from gun violence since 1970 than have died in every war dating back to the American Revolution. I know that lax gun regulations in the United States have led to this startling statistic: Between 2009 and 2010, 20,000 American firearms were found at Mexican crime scenes, and thousands more weapons from this side of the border are currently in the hands of Mexican drug cartels.
Anyone can learn these disturbing statistics, and so many more, from a few simple Google searches. You might conclude from this information that we need to pass comprehensive gun reform in this country, now. I certainly do. You may even conclude that inviting David Keene to speak on a panel at Harvard, five days after the latest mass shooting in our country, is disrespectful to the victims and their families. I would go even further and say that is not only disrespectful, but also that it is unacceptable.
That said, even if you and I reach all the same moral conclusions, what about the event series’ stated purpose of exploring “sociopolitical movements… not in terms of ideological position, but rather as a vehicle” for learning skills about building movements? Might David Keene’s experience with the NRA still offer eager, movement-ready Harvard students a chance to build their grassroots organizing skills and strategic capacities?
It’s true that the NRA has been highly successful in recent years in blocking public gun safety research, capitalizing on anti-government sentiment, and building vehement popular support, even as the numbers of gun deaths only continue to rise. But this level of success is not due to grassroots organizing. True social movements call into question the prevailing status quo. They are collective efforts that require sweat, tears, and sometimes even blood. Leaders of social movements organize communities into building political power, in order to make their voices heard on the issues that are most salient to them. Social movements, therefore, rise from the ground up, forcing the political and economic elite to acknowledge an injustice and perhaps act differently.
Nothing about that description applies to the NRA. The National Rifle Association has been so successful in maintaining lax gun regulations because of its highly effective lobbying arm. So far in 2015, for example, the gun lobby has spent $1,795,000 in Washington. Of course, polls reflect increasing opposition to gun control legislation: when the NRA can pour money into television ads, campaign strategies, and political lobbying machines, the message starts to take hold, and democracy is corrupted. We’ve seen the ramifications of that money already, since even the collective grief after Sandy Hook failed to result in a single federal law regulating gun sales or use, and we are sure to see the ramifications of that money in the upcoming campaign season as well. Thus, the event mistakenly positions the National Rifle Association as a justice-seeking grassroots social movement.
The National Rifle Association is not a social movement; it is a political lobby. Every day that we forget the NRA’s mission in order to learn from its political savvy, more innocent Americans are killed by guns, and we are even farther from the possibility of justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a chilly night in 2013, as the stress of the semester was coming to a peak, I had the most scarring experience of my life. In the moment, I wasn't aware that it was happening. Yet I will always remember the trauma. Being sexually assaulted—raped—shattered my self-image and confidence in my own voice. My self-worth was stolen from me by someone I previously trusted. In hindsight, it’s painfully obvious that he did me wrong. He violated me. He is to blame.
Still, I was the one who dealt with the repercussions.
Since then, I have healed. I went through a process of denial, acknowledgement, sadness, anger, therapy. I now love myself more than ever before. Though I will always carry the burden of my experience—and the knowledge that human beings are capable of exploiting each other without the slightest hesitancy—I have healed.
I want to share my story for several reasons: to paint an accurate picture of how rape happens at this prestigious institution, to encourage my peers to take an active role in prevention, to dispel the notion that sexual assault is a spectrum, and to tell other assault survivors that they are not alone and they are not to blame.
*****
It’s first semester sophomore year. A friend and classmate asks me to be his date to his team’s fall formal, held at a final club. My first date event! How could I say no to dressing up and getting free booze with Harvard athletes?
I agreed, but despite my anxious desire to experience what the chosen few did, I had reservations: On the second-to-last afternoon of freshman year, we had been smoking weed in his barren single, and his body language screamed of interest in initiating a make-out. I asked another guy friend on the same team whether, by going to the event, I’d be sending mixed signals where I wanted none. He assured me that my friendship with the soon-to-be perpetrator was solid enough such that I wouldn’t feel pressured to “do anything.”
That night, we get to the final club, and we’re each handed a bottle of Rosé. I look around and don't recognize any of the girls. Take a sip from the bottle. I have a handful of friends on the team, but they’re lost in the sea of made-up girls and rowdy guys. Take a sip from the bottle. I stay by his side. We mingle with other couples, take a sip. The guys start singing a repetitive chant, I don’t know what to do. Smile and nod with the beat, I guess. Take a sip. The bottle is gone. I’m 5’3”, 115 pounds. I don’t remember leaving the final club.
I also have no memory of the walk to his House, or the walk up the stairs, or the walk to his room. Next thing I do remember, I’m naked in his bed. I see his face—he’s on top of me, he’s inside of me, he’s sweaty. I vaguely realize what’s happening, and I explicitly realize that I don’t want to be where I currently am. Despite my confused state, I have an overwhelming instinct to leave. I get him off of me, and look for a way out. I walk into his roommate’s single, still naked. Wrong place. I walk through the common room, still naked, out the front door and into the hallway. I walk down the hall. I sit down and lean on a wall, maybe someone’s door. I black out again.
The next morning, I wake up alone in a foreign common room in a t-shirt that isn’t mine. I have bruises staining my sore legs, evidence of a nasty fall or two—evidence to anyone I was with that I was too drunk to consent. Still drunk, head pounding, throat dry, I quickly remember, in blurred bits and pieces, what happened. I’m confused, I don’t have any of my belongings, and I want to go home. So I do.
*****
I’ve always been a strong woman. Like many of my peers, I’ve been the captain of a team, I’ve been the president of a club, and I’ve been confident in my academic and social abilities throughout my entire life. Perhaps so firmly believing in my power and worth as an individual made being a rape victim more difficult to accept.
But even more powerful was the nauseating notion of sexual assault inhabiting a “gray area” in which alcohol blurs previously clear boundaries: What if he didn’t notice I was that drunk? Why was I that drunk to begin with? He was drunk too, so how can he be to blame? The gray area is bullshit.
Alcohol is an integral part of the college experience and the society we live in, for better or for worse. Alcohol also makes people more vulnerable. But everyone has the right to get as drunk as they want to without the threat of being raped. It’s easy to understand, but not so easy immediately after you’ve experienced an assault: Victims are not guilty for being drunk. Victims did not “put themselves in that situation” as a result of having been drunk. Victims should not ever feel ashamed of having been drunk.
In my case, and in many other cases of sexual assault on campus, alcohol played a role for the perpetrator as well. This does not excuse his guilt. Whatsoever.
Look at it this way: Everyone that consumes alcohol is aware that it distorts cognitive function. When a drunk driver enters a car, he knows he is impaired, which is why he is responsible for the death of the person he runs over. Likewise, at a party, a perpetrator knows he is impaired, and should be held accountable for the drunken assumptions he makes and acts on. He alone is to blame for the assault—not the alcohol, and certainly not the victim.
Of course, while I believe ending drunken hookups would be an extremely effective way to prevent sexual assault on campus, I’m not naive—this is an unrealistic goal. More importantly, while alcohol is a risk factor, it is not the ultimate cause of the sexual assault epidemic. Rather, the social factors underlying the manner in which we engage each other create an unhealthy party environment that far too often leads to assault. Education that emphasizes mutual respect and camaraderie among the student body, as well as the responsibility and accountability of the perpetrator, is indeed realistic. It’s also essential, and it’s also lacking.
To avoid being a rapist, learn how rape happens, and don’t do it. There are no gray areas.
Take active steps to seek consent before you and the other party begin drinking. As sexual assault education on campus increases, we should develop the maturity, respect, and compassion to overcome the social awkwardness of asking someone how they feel about engaging in a physical relationship. The discomfort of soberly communicating that you’re “down to sleep together tonight” is nothing compared to the discomfort of being penetrated against your will. If this approach does not align with your party habits, then stop having sex with people after parties. If you feel like you need the aid of alcohol to convince someone to hook up with you, then you shouldn't be hooking up with that person to begin with.
At a school that breeds goal-oriented individuals, it’s no surprise that this characteristic seeps into our hierarchical social scene where many seek and thrive on the self-validation of getting laid. Rather than hunting for the immediate gratification of sex on a Saturday night, here’s a thought: Get her number on Saturday, invite her over the next day to watch a movie, and see where it goes. We must curb the short-sighted perception that party nights are the only nights to have sex, and understand the fact that we are all equals in the same community with unique human desires and boundaries. It is imperative that we respect each other to make our school safe again.
Yes, it’s on Harvard to provide better education. Yet it’s also on individual students to be better people.
Primarily with the support of my loving sister, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and Mental Health Services, I did accept what had happened. I did accept I was raped. Upon doing so, I felt even more pain. But then, I felt relief.
If you feel unsettled or wronged after any sexual interaction, you are absolutely entitled to your reaction. It’s your body. If you feel unsettled or wronged, or confused, or unsure—much like I felt the days following what was clearly a case of assault—reach out. It feels so, so, so much better to do so. Reach out to OSAPR, to MHS, your family, your blockmates, even to me. You don’t have to carry the weight of your experience alone, because you’re not alone. And no one should ever have to handle sexual assault alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday afternoon, transportation companies and Harvard organizations gathered in the Science Center Plaza to showcase options for sustainable travel in Cambridge. The event was organized by CommuterChoice, a Harvard program that provides information for Harvard affiliates about commuting options and planning.
Among the wide variety of booths featuring sustainable transportation groups were some well-known names such as Hubway and Zipcar, as well as other lesser-known programs and businesses.
Ben A. Hammer, an administrator of the CommuterChoice program, said that the annual event aims to “let [the University community] know [about] all the stakeholders that are promoting sustainable transportation across campus.”
Kurt A. Belhumeur of Bern Unlimited, a business that sells bike and multi-sport helmets, manned a table advertising its products. He said the business encourages people to bike more and to bike safely.
“We’re a local company … trying to promote a healthy and active paradigm shift in lifestyle, and trying to do it in a fashionable and safe manner,” Belhumeur said.
At another table, a representative of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation encouraged attendees to sign up for a program that rewards commuters who use public transportation or walk. A representative of Park and Pedal provided information about its network of parking lots on the outskirts of Boston, which allow employees to park their cars for free and bike for the remainder of their commutes.
The Harvard Office for Sustainability and Harvard Transportation and Parking was present at the event as well. They explained the University’s efforts to improve sustainability, such as the more environmentally-friendly fuel the shuttles use and the University’s five-year sustainability plan.
Jennifer L. Lawrence, a sustainability planner for the city of Cambridge, said the city as a whole is striving to become more environmentally efficient. She explained that Cambridge is one of 50 communities across the nation competing for the Georgetown University Energy Prize, which will award $5 million to the city with the greatest reduction in energy use in the next two years.
The city also aims to have a net zero carbon footprint by 2070.

Amid caviar, jazz music, and animated conversation, 16 Harvard Innovation Lab ventures presented their products and services to a packed house at the i-lab’s “Stand Up Start Up Showcase” Wednesday evening.
The showcase was held as part of Boston HUBWeek, a series of events throughout the Greater Boston area organized jointly by Harvard, MIT, The Boston Globe, and Massachusetts General Hospital.
HUBWeek, in its first year, organized events that reflect a diversity of ideas from art and technology to science and culture. According to i-lab managing director Jodi Goldstein, HUBWeek mimics what the i-lab does every day to “bring together all that is Harvard in a cross-disciplinary way” and produce “amazing” results.
“The best way to celebrate HUBWeek was to have a showcase of all the startups that are working out of the i-lab,” she said.
From a robotic hand to an athletic sensor to insect-based food, the startups were chosen to represent “a diversity of ventures, a diversity of schools, a diversity of stages of development,” according to Goldstein.
The event was open to both Harvard affiliates and the Boston community, though non-Harvard individuals were required to reserve tickets online. These tickets were sold out well before the day of the event, Goldstein said.
After Goldstein’s opening remarks, each participating startup presented its project. Attendees could follow up with specific start-ups at booths allotted to each group.
“Few communities care as much about stories, ideas, and start-ups as Cambridge does,” said Carolina Aguilar of Bounce Imaging, one of the startups at the showcase. The company sells a softball-sized throwable camera that transmits images taken with six separate lenses when thrown into hidden areas, which can be stitched into a single 360-degree image.
The product was conceived when company founder and Aguilar’s brother Francisco Aguilar ’05 visited Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake.
“We thought, ‘There has has to be a better way to look through the debris for people,’” Carolina Aguilar said.
She added that the i-Lab, through showcases such as these, “amplified” their story on social media, giving them increased exposure. Katherine M. Manzi ’15 of Artlifting, another venture at the showcase, echoed this sentiment, saying that these types of events were great at “getting your brand out.”

Harvard faculty members have demonstrated an increased interest in the “flipped” classroom model, the practice of moving some material previously taught in lecture to pre-class video recordings, according to faculty involved in pedagogical research.
Robert A. Lue, faculty director of the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, said faculty members interested in an “active learning” model have recently consulted the Bok Center in increasing numbers, though the center does not keep statistics on flipped courses. To support interested professors, the Bok Center holds weekly “Active Learning Lunches.” 
The ramp-up in faculty interest comes as researchers publish more studies on the active learning model and others internally raise concerns about faculty and student workload under the flipped model.
Last month, a Yale and University of Massachusetts Amherst research group published online a study suggesting that the flipped model has an even greater benefit for women and students with lower grade point averages.
Though researchers conducted that analysis with just one higher-level physical chemistry class, Lue said it makes sense that a flipped classroom model would benefit groups who historically underperform in more traditional classrooms.
“It’s very true that active learning is far more inclusive. It’s a given,” Lue said. “In lecture, you just sit there and listen to someone. If you have a deficit in your background, or difference in your background, there’s very little opportunity in that kind of lecture to either engage the material in a different way or to ask a question or get help.”
But despite the enthusiasm among researchers and faculty, logistical challenges and student concerns around flipping the classroom remain.
Students have previously complained that online lectures provide inadequate explanations of course material and noted that flipped classrooms require them to spend more time on work outside of class.
Dustin Tingley, a Government professor and the head of the newly created Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Research Group, adds that adapting content for online learning comes with its own challenges, as does deciding what to do with the class time freed up by the approach.
“We’re replacing lecture, but we’re replacing lecture with what?” Tingley said.“There’s a lot of uncertainty about exactly what should be happening.”
Tingley also reiterated student concerns about workload.
“We are now asking students to do all the readings and watch the lectures at home and then come to class. And in order for the flipped class to be successful, students need to attend class,” Tingley said.
And while students might see an uptick in their coursework, he also said faculty must commit substantial time to moving lecture material online, echoing the concerns of professors who have adapted their courses for HarvardX, the University’s branch of virtual education platform edX.
“It’s a huge time investment,” said Tingley, who is in the process of taping some lectures for Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation,” a course he has taught in the past, to free up class time for active learning activities.
But to Lue, “flipping the classroom” does not necessarily mean moving all lectures online and entirely revamping a course. “Active learning,” the term Lue prefers, is any pedagogical technique that allows for more in-class feedback.
“There’s no such thing as [strictly] flipped and non-flipped [classrooms],” Lue said.

While the buildings of Harvard Law School are often the site of academic legal debate, Austin Hall saw a rarer occurrence Thursday: members of the federal bench hearing oral arguments in real cases.
Judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard 30-minute oral arguments for a series of patent and technology law appeals in a public event that was guarded by police officers and security personnel.
In a series of four cases, the panel of three judges heard oral arguments on topics ranging from neurological damage allegedly related to a vaccination to patents on cardiac defibrillators. The Law School was one of several Boston-area locations to host oral arguments for the court, which has sole jurisdiction on federal district court patent law cases and often hears appeals related areas of law like intellectual property.
The first case, Hirmiz v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, focused on the neurological degeneration of a young child. The appellants argued that a flu vaccination was the cause of the damage, a claim which the appellees contested.
“She was clearly injured by the flu shot,” said John McHugh, the lawyer who represented the girl’s parents.
The second case, Koninklijke Philips N.V. v. Zoll Medical Corporation, revolved around the question of patents for defibrillators. The largely procedural and technical argument was at times interrupted by moments of levity from the lawyers and judges.
“Fortunately, we haven’t heard anything here that is shocking,” Judge Alan D. Lourie ’56 said to laughs at the end of arguments about the resuscitation devices.
In the third case, SightSound Tech, LLC v. Apple Inc., judges heard arguments on the validity of SightSound’s patents on electronic music distribution. Apple’s iTunes service was accused of infringement by SightSound, which is contesting two previous decisions that effectively rendered its patents useless.
The final case involved an appeal to the court by Globus Medical, Inc. which claimed that it had not infringed on the intellectual property of private doctor Sabatino Bianco. Bianco claimed that Globus illegally reproduced an artificial medical device he designed to repair spinal injuries.
Attorneys for Globus pressed that though their client had capitalized on Bianco’s initial idea, Bianco had not contributed to the actual development of the product.

UPDATED: October 9, 2015, at 2:52 a.m.
The Signet Society, an off-campus social club primarily composed of members of Harvard’s arts community, moved to an open-application process earlier this semester following internal membership calls for diversity and inclusivity.
The co-ed club, which was founded in 1870, elected new members using the open process this month. Out of around 90 applicants, 17 new members were elected, according to Daniel A. Citron ’16, the Signet’s president. The club’s yellow-tinted Mount Auburn Street house, nicknamed the “Beehive,” hosts weekly lunches and socials to “celebrate the arts and letters,” according to its website, and also serves as a social space. 
Traditionally, current members of the Signet have “put-up,” or nominated, one to two of their peers for admission. But beginning last spring, Signet members began questioning the ability of this process to properly represent the Harvard arts community.
“At the beginning of last semester, when the list of ‘put-ups’ came out, I brought up to the membership that we didn’t have that many people of color on our ‘put-up’ list, and that I thought it was an issue we should address,” said Reylon A. Yount ’16, a member of the Signet.
Members also considered the club’s reach within the campus arts community. According to Maya M. Park ’16, the Signet’s vice president and a Crimson Fifteen Minutes writer, the nature of the traditional nomination process favored those who were in campus arts organizations, like the Harvard Advocate and Harvard Lampoon, and excluded artists in less established communities.
“It makes it no longer about the arts, but instead about who you know and whether you’re in the established communities,” Citron said of the ‘put-up’ system.
After these concerns were raised, board members organized membership-wide discussions over the efficacy of the club's admissions procedures. From those conversations came the idea of an open application.
“We felt that over conversations about diversity, access, exclusivity, and safety we recognized that in a way the Signet represented the things that made people hurt,” Park said.
According to Park, the number of first-round applicants this year exceeded traditional levels. The process still includes one round of cuts, followed by a round of voting by members to decide final membership.
Current board members emphasized that the shift is a work in progress, and according to Park, this alteration is only one step in an incomplete process of future changes.
“We are undertaking something that is very large, which is trying to make a space that was traditionally one of Harvard’s exclusive spaces something that is more open, accepting, and not only for a specific group of arts students,” Citron said.

Former Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta discussed his relationship with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama along with critical moments in his more than 40-year career in public service at the Kennedy School on Thursday.
Panetta, who was unanimously confirmed as Secretary of Defense by the Senate in 2011, previously served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Obama, Director of the Office of Management and Budget and later Chief of Staff under Clinton, and as a Democratic Congressman representing what was then California’s 16th congressional district.
As CIA Director, Panetta oversaw the SEAL Team Six raid on Osama bin Laden’s safe house in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a mission now considered one of the major achievements of the Obama administration. At the event Thursday, Panetta recounted how the operation came about, with the tracking of one of bin Laden’s couriers to a suspiciously large, walled compound in which a man was seen pacing about, as if a prisoner.
“I said...to my people, ‘We need to get an ID on this person — you know, put a telescope on a mountain, give me some cameras on a wall, do something,’” Panetta said. “And they said, ‘You know, it’s very tough, Mr. Director, the walls are there, we can’t get a good angle, it’s dangerous.’”
“I said, ‘You know what, I’ve seen movies where the CIA can do this!’” Panetta added, jokingly.
When asked to compare Clinton and Obama, Panetta said that Clinton was better at reaching out to the American people and briefing them about his vision for the country from the bully pulpit of the Oval Office.
Perhaps even more importantly, Panetta said that Clinton enjoyed the internal politics of presidency much more than Obama, such as listening to and negotiating with different people and viewpoints. 
“President Obama doesn’t like that process, really doesn’t like the process of engaging with the political types on the Hill,” Panetta said. “I think his approach is to present something that he believes is logical and that is good policy, and that others ought to embrace that. Unfortunately, logic doesn’t work in Washington.”
Panetta also criticized Obama’s decision to back away from the “red line” he set in Syria, where Obama warned that there would be “enormous consequences” should the Assad regime use chemical weapons.
Reflecting on the budget sequestration in 2013 that slashed defense spending across the board, Panetta said political authorities on Capitol Hill today govern less by leadership and more by emergency.
“Today what’s happening in Washington is that policy is being driven by crisis,” Panetta said. “You’ve got to have a crisis, you’ve got to be at the edge of the cliff—the government’s going to shut down, the debt limit is not going to be raised, all hell is going to break loose.”
And as for any possible future work in Washington—perhaps even as Secretary of State—the longtime public servant simply remarked that he was happy to now be living 3,000 miles away from Washington.
“We have a walnut farm that my father planted back in California, and I enjoy working with a different set of nuts,” he joked.

Course staff for Harvard’s flagship undergraduate economics course have renamed the practice exam portion of the class to reflect its role as a place for academic support.
Formerly called “Unit Tests” and now called “Unit Reviews,” the optional exams for the course, Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” will still function as practice tests for students to demonstrate their knowledge of the material, said Anne Le Brun, the course’s new head teaching fellow.
Le Brun succeeds Ec 10’s longtime head TF David W. Johnson, who left Harvard at the end of last school year.
Undergraduate students who previously served as Ec 10 peer “graders” are now are called “tutors,” and students who oversee the tutors are called supervisors.
“The change in terminology is just to make students aware of the support function of this program,” Le Brun said. “The word ‘test’ and ‘graders,’ I think ... it potentially could stress people out.”
Ec 10 has five of these optional “Unit Reviews,” each with several versions and offered eight times. If students wish to participate in the review, they are assigned a deadline based on who serves as their teaching fellow.
Depending on how students demonstrate knowledge of the course material, they receive passing or failing marks from the peer tutors on duty. Regardless of students’ grades, those tutors subsequently review the practice exams with the Ec 10 students.
James M. Graham ’17, formerly a course grader and a supervisor of the program this year, said he appreciates the new Unit Review name.
“The program really focuses on solidifying economic concepts through tutoring based on a test,” Graham wrote in an email. “As such, it's more about the tutoring than the test itself, hence the name change.”
Le Brun described the program as “really nice, informal walk-in tutoring.”
Over the summer, Rachel Deyette Werkema, the course staff member responsible for coordinating Ec 10 Unit Reviews, suggested the name change, an idea that “seemed like a lot of sense,” Le Brun said.
Werkema referred The Crimson to Le Brun and course instructor N. Gregory Mankiw, writing in an email, “the economics department would prefer that you speak directly to [them].”
Apart from Unit Review tutors, students who serve as Ec 10 tutors through the Bureau of Study Counsel said the name change highlights how well the program complements the course.
“As far as the program goes, I think it’s very helpful to go over the material, and I encourage all of my tutees [to participate],” BSC tutor Eric J. Hollenberg ’17 said, adding, “If they’ve changed the name to make it more accessible, then great—I think that only helps.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust has allocated a lump sum to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana to fund undergraduate social events, including a large party this Friday, a move that comes on the heels of calls for the College to create more on-campus social spaces.
Faust said she freed up the money—she declined to specify the amount—to Khurana in response to students and administrators who have asked to bolster on-campus social spaces in light of recent campus events. 
Students, alumni, and administrators have spent the better part of the semester so far debating the role of the College’s off-campus final clubs, with Faust herself criticizing the eight all-male groups and raising concerns about the potential for alcohol abuse and sexual assault to occur on their properties. Shortly after her comments, the Spee Club moved to go co-ed.
Just weeks later, Harvard released the grim results of its sexual assault climate survey, again sparking the debate about social space—especially alternatives to final clubs—as students argued that the College should provide safe and open places in which undergraduates can socialize.
Faust, for her part, said the new funds fit into Khurana’s broader goal of increasing undergraduate social events. “One thing he’s emphasizing and putting some attention to is social spaces and safe social events, and so I’ve transferred some funds to him to help support that effort,” Faust said.
Khurana, who described the fund as a “generous amount,” said Faust offered the money as a preliminary measure “to be used alongside College funds to support a variety of different student social activities” as administrators begin discussing a long-term plan to further fund the College’s social life.
College administrators will decide how to distribute the resources in coordination with undergraduates, Khurana said. Already, the dean—who is also the co-master of Cabot House—has directed a portion of the money to fund part of a large party that women’s groups on campus plan to host on Friday night. The event, dubbed the “Blank Party” and free and open to all undergraduates, will take place in the Science Center Plaza.
Khurana could receive more money for such initiatives in the future, according to Faust. “It’s going to be an ongoing conversation about how much more he needs,” she said. “This was just meant for an initial start.”
It is not usual course for Faust, who as president also oversees all of Harvard’s graduate schools and travels the globe to fundraise for the University, to allocate funds specifically for undergraduate parties. But administrators at the College level have taken other steps to bolster the student social scene. Most recently, some Houses, including Khurana’s Cabot, opened renovated spaces where undergraduates can host parties and other events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beginning with graduating seniors in the College’s Class of 2016, leaders at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education hope to redefine American standards and practices for educator preparation with a new model of teacher training.
With the program, dubbed the Harvard Teacher Fellows, Harvard will join institutions like Yale, Brown, Stanford, and the University of Texas in offering prospective educators an alternative to organizations like Teach for America.
On-campus student groups, including Students for Education Reform and the Student Labor Action Movement, have been vocal and active in both their support of and objections to various programs.
In particular, TFA has faced criticism regarding its two-year commitment for corps members and what detractors call the lack of adequate support and training it gives educators before placing them in schools. In protest of TFA’s alleged faults, SLAM publicly demanded that Harvard sever its ties to the organization last fall.
While still maintaining collaborative partnerships with TFA, Harvard’s pre-professional Undergraduate Teacher Education Program, the Cambridge-Harvard Summer Academy, and the graduate-level Teacher Education Program, the architects of HTF seek to improve upon shortcomings in existing models for teacher preparation, as well as to recruit College students dedicated to the field. Meanwhile, teaching-minded seniors face a vast array of options in pursuing the best route towards becoming impactful educators themselves.
MOVING AWAY FROM ‘SINK-OR-SWIM’
HTF is designed to address what organizers call a relative lack of support in most teacher training models, both during the program and after its completion, HTF’s directors said.
“There’s too much sink-or-swim in teacher education,” said Stephen R. Mahoney, the program’s associate director. “That’s very much the chapter that’s opening about school improvement and school reform. How do we make it so that every school has great teachers? Because right now, we don’t have that.”
HTF, which will accept applications from the Class of 2016 until Oct. 28, will engage Harvard students in the second semester of their senior year, with selected students taking a foundational course in the spring and remaining at Harvard for a summer-long training program following Commencement. In September, they will be deployed to partner school networks and districts where they will teach in a classroom, though with only a 60 percent workload.
Fellows will then come back to Cambridge for a second summer of professional development for additional support before they return to classrooms. Upon a second year of teaching and program completion, fellows will continue to have support and connections to HTF for the next few years of their careers.
HTF Director Eric H. Shed lauded the program’s ideological approach to what has been a partisan area in the field of education.
“Philosophically, I think Steve and I have a shared belief in that we’re interested in what works,” Shed said. “That’s one of the ways in which we can really take the lead, is borrowing from everybody and breaking down the typical schisms that you see in education policy and practice.”
According to Ed School senior lecturer Katherine K. Merseth, the director of the graduate-level Teaching Education Program, HTF has been in development since 2003. She attributed administrative support for the program’s launch to Dean James E. Ryan’s arrival two years ago. But even with a decade of planning behind the program, more financial resources were ultimately necessary to get HTF off the ground.
“It’s funding-based. I think if our prior dean had found $15 million in 2008, we would have done it,” Merseth said. “It’s a happy ending.”
For her part, University President Drew G. Faust said students reached out to her requesting more opportunities for teaching beginning when she was first named president in 2007.
“What students wanted to talk to me about was...[how] no one told them that it was a valued and respected thing to be a teacher,” Faust said in an interview this month. “I’ve felt that we could underscore the value of this career choice and also provide really excellent preparation for students given the strength of the Ed School.”
HEAD TO HEAD
Although both HTF and TFA say they seek to recruit and place high-quality, devoted teachers in low-income communities around the country, they differ in their implementation methods, as well as their expectations for teachers upon completion of the programs.
Merseth said that while TFA conducts six weeks of intensive training, which can overwhelm some corps members, HTF provides a more paced, in-depth training model over two summers to maximize the time fellows have with master teachers in residence.
By investing more time and resources into the experience and training of fellows, a greater time commitment is expected of them following program completion than at other prestigious teacher preparation programs, Merseth added.
“One of the criticisms of Teach for America is that it was just a resume-builder and that people were using disadvantaged children to their own advantage,” Merseth said. “We’re not looking for a lifetime commitment, but something more [than two years].”
Laura K. Brennan ’16, who completed UTEP last year and intends to pursue teaching upon graduation, said she sees HTF as a better alternative to TFA, pointing to the smaller, more personalized model and the larger resource base for fellows.
“A lot of [TFA] teachers quit after the first year because they feel like they’re drowning and...don’t have a lot of support,” Brennan said. “Regardless of whether or not you’re for or against TFA, it’s undeniable that Harvard Teacher Fellows does eliminate the parts of TFA that are very controversial.”
For her part, TFA Chief Executive Officer Elisa Villanueva Beard defends her program, saying that most young college graduates realistically do not envision holding one form of employment indefinitely. In under-resourced school districts, she said in an interview on a visit to Harvard, there is a high rate of turnover and more difficulty in attracting talent.
“Those days are over when we’re asking anybody to commit to anything for a lifetime,” Beard said. “I think it’s easy to critique an organization because we’re organized...but I don’t think it’s fair.”
Beard added that TFA gives special focus to public service, encouraging what she described as passion to serve children and schools in low-income areas, regardless of whether corps members ultimately decide to continue teaching as a career. TFA alums entering other fields like government, policy, or medicine can apply their understanding gained from working in underserved communities, and that benefits education on a more nuanced level, Beard said.
“Our entire theory of change is not that folks are going to stay in education for the rest of their lives,” Beard said. “It’s going to take people at every level of our society and sector beating a drum about this.”
While HTF and TFA each target Harvard undergraduates for recruitment, the leaders for each program expressed mutual sentiments of support.
Bryan S. Sohn, the TFA recruitment manager for Harvard, said having another teacher training program recruiting from the senior class advances improvements in education.
“It’s not a zero-sum game,” Sohn said. “If anything, both of our organizations will get more people into our respective organizations because we’re contributing to a growing public service consciousness on campus.”
Characterizing the relationship between TFA and HTF as complementary rather than adversarial, Shed, the HTF director, said TFA’s longer history, compared to HTF’s inaugural year with a smaller class of fellows, places the two programs in different arenas.
“TFA has a national reach in terms of the students they deal with and deals with thousands and thousands of students. We’re trying to grow from a program of about 25 students to 100,” Shed said. “I don’t think there’s ever going to be that sort of real, direct competition.”
Beard also said that she has been in communication with Ryan, the dean of the Ed School, as HTF and TFA hope to meet different demands in education preparation.
“We’re deeply supportive of each other's’ charges and missions, which are quite different,” Beard said. “There really is no silver bullet. Not one solution is going to solve this.”
Beth A. Simpson, the director of UTEP, said she encourages her advisees to choose whichever model best fits their learning styles and interests, whether that is UTEP, TFA, HTF, or some combination of more than one program.
‘THE LIGHTHOUSE EFFECT’
Leaders in HTF’s development aim to make a larger impact on teacher education beyond Harvard’s campus, and even beyond Cambridge. By utilizing a system of national partner networks, HTF has the potential to set new standards in teacher education on a national level, Merseth said.
“There’s a bigger role here which is for Harvard to play, as a respected leader, and people look to Harvard and see what we’re doing,” Merseth said. “There’s a bit of what I call a ‘lighthouse effect.’”
Former HTF Interim Director Jon R. Star said a broad geographic reach in finding the best partner networks and mentor educators remained critical for the placement of fellows, regardless of location.
“Finding high quality mentor teachers to help train novice teachers is very difficult to do. It’s a tough job not only to be a teacher, but also to be a teacher of teachers,” Star said. “We’ve decided to try something new, which is to not be limited by that geographic proximity and to just look for the right kind of partners in terms of schools or districts.”
Fellows will be placed in clusters within the partner network schools based on a combination of fellow and school preference and equal distribution of subject areas, according to Mahoney. Thus far, Leadership Public Schools in California has been solidified as the first partner work, and several others are in negotiation in cities like Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, New York City, and most recently Boston. Every school network is located in urban, under-resourced communities, Mahoney said.
“Every school network or district that we’ve contacted is absolutely interested in being a part of HTF,” Mahoney said. “The trick here is to have some geographic diversity so that we do have a national impact as a program.”
Fellows will also be encouraged and expected to remain teaching at their partner schools or districts for a four to seven year commitment, Mahoney said.
“The schools and the fellow should see the fellowship there as a prolonged interview. The fellow’s interviewing the school, and the school’s interviewing the fellow,” Mahoney said. “The schools are absolutely seeing this as a pipeline.”
Merseth highlighted the increasing adaptation and implementation of the University of Texas’s UTeach Institute model in schools as an example of how HTF’s influence might spread to other universities.
“My dream is that other universities will look at the model that we are developing here with the Harvard Teacher Fellowship and do their own,” Merseth said. “There’s precedent for this kind of ‘copy-catting,’ and I think that’s great.”
An information session for HTF will take place on Oct. 19, and the program will accept applications from the Class of 2016 until Oct. 28.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High school point guard Bryce Aiken, the No. 78 recruit in the Class of 2016, announced his commitment to Harvard Thursday afternoon on Twitter. Aiken is the second member of the Scout.com's Top 100 to commit to Harvard, a first for the Crimson.
"We have a high caliber recruiting class and talented kids,” Aiken told Scout.com. “We all went on the visit together so it was nice to get to know them. I’m looking forward to get up there with those players and helping make history.”
The talented point guard is the first four-star recruit Harvard has had at the position under coach Tommy Amaker. He is, along with freshman Tommy McCarthy, one of the long-term candidates to take over the position from senior Siyani Chambers, who is taking a year of leave to rehab his ACL injury.
Both represent a change in recruiting strategy for the team, which has loaded up on highly touted forwards and centers in years past. Since Amaker arrived, the team has recruited 13 players who earned a three or four-star rating from ESPN: just two were classified as guards. The strategy has had measurable effects on the court: over the last three years, just two players—Chambers and Wesley Saunders ’15—have played nearly all the backcourt minutes for the team.
Aiken, whom an ESPN high school scouting report called “a complete point guard”, noted that the team pursued him relentlessly.
"[All the coaches] were on me through the entire way," Aiken told NJ.com. "And Coach Amaker just did a tremendous job of explaining how he would use me in his system, and how he believed in me and trusted me to be the next great one from Harvard.”
Aiken is Harvard’s sixth verbal commit in the Class of 2016, joining fellow top-100 recruit Chris Lewis, four-star recruit Robert Baker Jr., and four other three-stars. The class is Harvard’s largest since the class of 2011, which included three-year starters Steve Moundou-Missi ’15 and Wesley Saunders ’15 and five rotation players overall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unstoppable force, meet immovable object.
Something will have to give this weekend, when the Harvard women’s soccer team and its leading scorer, junior forward Midge Purce, meet the nation’s top-ranked scoring defense when it travels to Cornell on Saturday.
The current Ivy League Player of the Week, Purce is coming off of a two-game spell in which she tallied four of the Crimson’s last six goals. Her hat trick propelled Harvard (5-6-1, 2-0-0 Ivy) to a 4-0 win over Yale this past weekend before Purce tallied the first Crimson goal in a 2-1 victory over Boston University on Tuesday.
“We’ve been playing much better as a team of late, and Midge is a big part of it,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “She had a rough start, but she’s really playing at a top level right now.”
Harvard sputtered slightly out of the gate, winning just one of its first six games against tough nonconference opposition, but it enters the weekend brimming with confidence. The team began Ancient Eight play two weekends ago with a 2-0 triumph against Penn before defeating the Bulldogs and Terriers in rapid succession on the road.
“We are very confident as a team,” junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack said. “We go into every game confident; it has nothing to do with who we are playing. Everyone is happy, playing well, scoring goals, and we’re defending well…. At the same time, every Ivy League game is tough, and Cornell is undefeated, which is an impressive feat at this point in the season.”
The Big Red (8-0-3, 1-0-1), however, possesses an airtight defense, with junior goalkeeper Kelsey Tierney boasting a 0.086 goals-against average, the best in the nation. Cornell’s back line has conceded just one goal all season, shutting out its other 10 opponents.
Unlocking the stubborn Big Red defense will be a stern test for the Crimson attack, a group that seems to be gelling at just the right time. After scoring just twice in five games leading up to Ivy League play, Harvard has netted eight goals in its past three games.
Purce is not the only one finding her rhythm, with classmate Rachel Garcia slotting the game-winner home from 25 yards out against BU after assisting Purce on the equalizer.
Junior right back Bailey Gary has been an especially important part of the Crimson’s offensive resurgence, recording a goal and three assists in the team’s two Ivy League games. Her increased production has been part of a shift in the way Harvard has attacked, with the fullbacks pushing forward more often to link up with the wingers.
“[Gary] has had an unbelievable season so far,” Durack said. “She’s a great defender. She’s taken on more of an attacking role, and her experience in the Ivy League is really starting to show through. She’s always had it in her, but with confidence and experience, she’s showing it all now.”
Cornell’s offense, however, has not been quite as consistent as its defense, with the Big Red dropping points in a 0-0 draw at Penn last weekend. Sophomore forward Paige DeLoach and junior midfielder Elizabeth Crowell are tied for the team lead in goals with three each.
Harvard’s defense seems well-equipped to handle this weekend’s opponents, with the back four finding chemistry as the consistency of Ivy play sets in. Senior central defender Alika Keene has formed a formidable partnership with sophomore Marie Becker, supported along the flanks by fullbacks Gary and senior Brooke Dickens.
“I think we’re all just really familiar with each other,” Keene said. “We all just know how to work well together, and it comes from spending a lot time on the field together. We don’t really have to talk as much...the chemistry is finally coming together.”
Harvard continues to have a target on its back, having captured its second straight Ivy League title in 2014. The Crimson defeated Cornell, 2-0, in this fixture last season on its way to conference silverware.
“We have to bring our best because everyone that we play brings their best,” Leone said. “Our team is experienced and understands that. This is the challenge for them, to play everyone’s absolute best for seven weeks in a row. That’s what makes the Ivy League so exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­For a team that only lost two seniors to graduation, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (6-7, 2-1 Ivy) has had to suddenly rely on a lot of its underclassmen in the first few games of its Ivy League slate.
Back ailments led to the early retirement of senior middle blocker Jennifer Shults over the past offseason, forcing rookies such as Jocelyn Meyer to fill in the vacuum of space that were Shults’ 139 kills last season.
A high-ankle sprain also sidelined senior Kathleen Wallace for a few weeks before her return last week, thrusting the likes of freshmen Anna Uhr and Christina Cornelius into prominent roles in their rookie years.
But just as Wallace had recovered and things seemed to be looking up for the Crimson at the perfect time—with matchups against archrival Yale (8-4, 3-0) and Brown (8-6, 2-1) on the horizon—the squad was just dealt another blow that will alter the team’s course from hereon out.
Junior outside hitter Grace Weghorst has just been ruled out for the season to tend to a “stress fracture in my lower back as well as developing arthritis in [her] spine,” according to the Texas native herself.
The junior tried to cap her time early in the season to try to keep playing in some capacity, but even in limited action, the ailments began to be too much to continue on.
“A lot of time was spent with my trainers discussing my options,” Weghorst said. “I got a cortisone shot in my back but nothing worked. I’m just trying to take some time off to heal before next season.”
Now, the team heads into a critical matchup with perennial power Yale with a loss already on its record and without one of its two All-Ivy players from last season.
“Grace was one of those people who I could look at and really say ‘We need to win this, and I need your help,’ and she would get us the win,” junior Corie Bain said. “And she would get us a win.”
The team’s last memories of Yale came in the Malkin Athletic Center the night before The Game, losing both the game in straight-sets and a chance to go to play in the NCAA Tournament representing the Ivy League.
Despite two wins early in the season against its archrival, the third matchup saw Yale adjust to the Harvard attack and record ten more kills than its Crimson counterparts.
Now, a loss in this game all but ensures that the team will have to win out to have a chance to win a share of the Ivy League.
“That was a whole different team,” Bain said. “We don’t dwell on our past, even if it’s an amazing past like last season...It’s not relevant at this point.”
Yale did lose Ivy League Player of the Year Mollie Rogers to graduation this past offseason, but the Bulldogs have not missed a beat, starting off the conference slate on a three-game win streak.
Senior Kelly Johnson has averaged over 16 kills in the trio of Ivy League games thus far on the season.
Newcomer Kelley Wirth has burst onto the scene for the Bulldogs, averaging just under 13 kills per conference contest.
Despite Yale’s pedigree, however, the team isn’t intimidated.
“There’s nothing about Yale that scares me,” Bain said. “It’s more about the fact that they’re our rival institutionally that really inspires me to want to beat them.”
After an all-important conference game with Yale that would give Harvard control of its destiny going forward, the team will finish the weekend with a tilt against Brown.
Last year, Brown dealt Harvard one of its two losses in a straight-set loss the day after an emotional, five-set win over the Bulldogs.
The Bears have also got off to a hot start, its only conference loss having come at the hands of the Bulldogs.
Brown also boasts a highly-touted freshman in Sabrina Stillwell, who took home ECAC and Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors after recording 32 kills in a five-set win over Columbia, only two kills away from tying the school record.
“I’m more anxious about playing Brown than I am Yale,” Bain said. “It’s harder for us to match up and know how to defend them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday, the Harvard football team (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) will experience the longest bus ride of its season.
Six hours—that’s how long it will take the Crimson coach to wind from Cornell’s stadium in Ithaca, N.Y. to a reserved parking spot in Cambridge, Mass.
If Harvard defeats the Big Red (0-3, 0-1 Ivy), earning a 12th consecutive road win, the trip may well whip by in a blur of celebration and rest.
But if the Crimson exits with a loss, the players will have lots of lonely medians to stare at as they contemplate the result—and those six hours may feel more like 60.
Any road trip threatens a deflated bus ride home, but in this case, the stakes of deflation are especially high, both because the trip is so long and Cornell is so winless.
In the first three weeks of play, the Big Red has dropped three defeats in demoralizing, if not heartbreaking, fashion.
At homecoming on week one, Cornell held a four-point lead over Bucknell for most of the fourth quarter before conceding a fourth-down touchdown pass with less than two minutes left. The Big Red lost that one, 19-14.
The next Saturday, Cornell built a 26-7 lead at Yale before wilting in the second half, giving up 27 unanswered points en route to a 33-26 defeat.
And this past weekend versus Colgate, the Big Red faced a 28-7 gap, narrowed the score to 28-21, got the ball back, marched to the Raiders’ 10-yard line, and ultimately missed four straight passes to seal the result.
No, it has not been an easy season for Cornell.
By contrast, Harvard has paraded from one blowout to the next. Thus far the Crimson has played Rhode Island, Brown, and Georgetown and won 41-10, 53-27, and 45-0, respectively.
In order to flip this script, the Big Red will rely on senior running back Luke Hagy. A second-team all-Ivy selection in 2014, Hagy has topped 100 yards rushing in each of the past six games, including 117 in the league matchup against the Bulldogs.
“They run a lot of under-center stuff, which is kind of an anomaly now in the modern football game,” said senior right end Dan Moody. “I like to think they’re a run-first team with the great running back they have.”
Meanwhile Harvard has stiffened against the run since giving up 141 yards to the Rams in the first week. In the two contests since, the Crimson has held opponents to an average of 80 yards on the ground.
Some of this improvement relates to the increased comfort of Harvard’s defensive line, a unit that restructured from last season after graduating seniors Obum Obukwelu and Zack Hodges.
“The energy of the defense has been fantastic,” Moody said. “We’re playing at a really high level.”
However, the strength of this year’s defense remains in the secondary and linebacker corps, where the Crimson starts only seniors.
On offense Harvard also boasts enviable experience. Four seniors man the offensive line, and these veterans have merged into a unit that has yet to give up a sack.
“We should be good up front,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “In terms of experience, ability, and leadership, that’s as good a group as we’re going to have.”
Hagy’s counterpart, running back Paul Stanton, is also a senior, and he has seen significant snaps since his freshman year. Over four years, Stanton has tallied 31 career touchdowns on the ground, placing him second in school history.
When the two teams met last season, Harvard used a 150-yard rushing attack to pull away for a 24-7 victory. But the final result belied a tense affair in which neither team scored before halftime.
“They bring a lot of pressure,” said senior tight end Anthony Firkser. “They did last year. They stopped us in the run in the first half.”
Still, that 2014 game was one of nine defeats on the season for Cornell, which finished second-to-last in the Ivy League. This season sportswriters didn’t even grant the Big Red that position, as the preseason Ancient Eight poll banished Cornell to the cellar.
A last-place ranking, a three-game stretch of misery, and a long losing streak—all these facts pile into chips on the shoulders of Big Red players, who almost certainly view the Crimson as the toughest test to date.
Meanwhile Harvard bears a different weight, namely a streak of 17 consecutive wins and nine straight against Cornell.

Guess who's back, back again
Turkey’s back, tell a friend
It’s officially that time of the year: the Harvard Square turkey is out on the streets once again. This is big news.
I saw it two days ago in the Adams House courtyard. After chasing it for a few seconds, it gobbled at me. I gobbled back, but the turkey was unimpressed and waddled away with purposeful vigor.
While the turkey isn’t quite ready to lay down classic hip-hop rhymes like Eminem, its own guttural, aggressive gobble seems to point to a bright future in the music industry.
I’m really confused about this turkey’s living habits. Where does the turkey go during the summer? It’s not like turkeys fly away (or waddle?) during the warmer months because Boston summers are too hot. And what about winter? Turkeys don’t hibernate or fly south during the winter either. So where does he/she/it go?
Such is the turkey’s cunning and sharp intellect...
The turkey is simultaneously the most popular individual on campus, appearing on my Snapchat feed at least five times each day, yet nobody really knows anything about this mythical creature.
Where does it live? Does it eat food that might get dropped on Mass Ave? Did it get punched by the Spee this year?
So many questions.

Dear Mysterious Admin(s),
In a world where the most beloved Clover is closing and there is a weird absence of swai, there is a Facebook page that can bring back joy into a Harvard student’s life. Well, at least a little. That hero is you, Harvard Compliments. So when I saw that you requested me out of the blue, I have to say I was shocked and immediately pleased.
I’m not talking about this Harvard Compliments page, nor this one. I’m talking about you, the one with 4,462 (and counting) friends on Facebook and you, who "studied Happiness at Harvard University" according to your Facebook profile. None can compare to you with your popularity and choice of a concentration, other than Economics or Government.
Being added by you was a pleasant surprise, like HUDS serving Happy Birthday cake on my actual birthday. Since you are a place where you post, " just good-hearted compliments," I was eager to see what you had in store for me.
But sadly I soon learned, getting friend requested by you does not mean that you have a compliment waiting for me at the time. I was heartbroken, crushed even. Why mysterious admin? I wanted “the kindness to begin” with me too!
But while I comforted myself with my tenth Ranger cookie, at least I know you’re doing a great service to this campus, like the petting zoo near the Science Center or Tomato Basil Ravioli. With midterms coming back to back, temperatures dipping past comfortable sweater weather averages, and Harvard life in general, we all need a little reminder of the many great people on this campus and how much we do actually (I mean actually) love each other.
So keep on doing your thing, make thousands of posts, or at least 1738. Harvard Compliments, thank you.
