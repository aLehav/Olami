After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 11, House Representative Peter T. King of New York, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, commenced a series of Congressional hearings about “homegrown Islamic terrorism,” or the radicalization of American Muslims. Ironically, the sensational Congressional hearings set the stage for a potential shift in American public opinion from uneasiness toward the estimated 2.5 million Muslims in the United Sates to a willingness to engage with this small but politically significant demographic. The shift may have major repercussions affecting the Muslim-American community and the domestic radicalization that Representative King wishes to eradicate.
Although a rarity among liberal civil rights proponents, anti-Islamic sentiment has seen a resurgence in recent years. Perhaps this resurgence is related to the onset of the recession, which has prompted a national anxiety that has helped give rise to the arguably Islamophobic Tea Party movement. As a Muslim who grew up in conservative, rural Appalachia, I can attest that unease toward Islam is alive and well among certain demographics. Currently, 52 percent of Americans believe that the congressional hearings are appropriate; this includes 69 percent of Republicans and 40 percent of Democrats. As the hearings proceed and presumably continue to generate civil liberty concerns and parallels to McCarthyism, approval may very well decline.
In contrast to other recent Islamic-Western controversies, King’s hearings may unwittingly improve the image of Islam in the West. In this case, Muslims are not the instigators; the hearings have not been caused by anyone’s plans to build a mosque at Ground Zero, or anyone’s refusal to remove a hijab in France. The hearings were not crafted in response to a specific action, but planned by King even before he became the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. After these plans were set in motion, Muslims and non-Muslims gathered peacefully in Times Square to protest the hearings; King repeatedly dismissed their concerns as an adherence to “political correctness.” The net product of these factors is the perception of a passive community under fire from unrelenting politicians. Indeed, King’s adamant crusade has widely been compared to McCarthyism, as evidenced by the surging popularity of the satirical Twitter hashtag #MUAC, or “Muslim Un-American Activities Committee.”
In consistency with McCarthyist radicalism, much of the defense for the legitimacy of the U.S. Muslim hearings relies on murky, emotional logic. “To back down,” King stated at the first hearing in response to criticism, “would be a craven surrender to political correctness and an abdication of what I believe to be the responsibility of this committee.” In reality, the ethical grievance of singling out a religious demographic to prove its loyalties before Congress is far more consequential than mere political incorrectness. Further, despite his committee’s broad focus on homeland security, King has rejected calls for the hearings to address domestic terrorism by sources other than Islamist extremists.
Representative King has inadvertently turned the tables on the Islam-in-America debate, providing non-Muslim Americans with a highly visible example of the threat of political discrimination against their neighbors. Supporters of King’s ideology will nonetheless continue to assert the legitimacy of the hearings and their anti-Islamic implications. As for the American population at large, which is nearly evenly split on approval of the hearings, King’s grand trials could decide the toss-up on Islam in public opinion. On one side of the coin is a continued trend toward misconception of the Muslim-American community; on the other side is the disentanglement of politicized fears and civil liberties. Ideally, popular opinion would espouse the notion that in order to properly investigate the phenomenon of “homegrown terrorism,” Congress, or a more suitable institution of government, must first elicit the cooperation of the American Muslim community via ethical engagement.
In the tug-of-war between civil rights and national security concerns, it would be easy to cast Representative King as a single-minded Islamophobe or, conversely, a right-wing champion of justice. To do either would be a gross simplification. Should we avoid ascribing an equally simplistic role to the Muslim-American community in the context of domestically bred terrorism, we stand to gain a more sophisticated understanding of the issue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My brother, a freshman, had been saying for weeks that he wanted to be in the Quad, but I could tell that he was visibly relieved when screaming Quincy-ites rushed into Hollis where his blocking group was anxiously awaiting their assignment. Not only has Quincy been my home for the past three years—our matching placements a freak coincidence—but Quincy is also slated to be the first house to undergo renewal, beginning in fall 2012. While House Renewal will undoubtedly improve the physical quality of housing at Harvard, without careful attention, renovations in Quincy (and, eventually, the rest of the Houses) may limit students’ access to House life. Planning for House Renewal must pay close attention to the effects of massive construction and relocation on the students like my brother who will endure the process.
By eliminating walk-through rooms, increasing the amount of common spaces, modernizing bathrooms and heating systems, and even bringing cable television into dorm rooms, House Renewal will undoubtedly bring much-needed improvements to dormitories built for a different era of student life. I am envious that my brother will be among the first students who have the opportunity to reap the benefits of what is sure to be a transformational and vastly beneficial process, one that, after reading the university’s Report on Harvard House Renewal[EM1] , has clearly been thought about critically and creatively. And I have no doubt that physical improvement will translate into increased ability for House Committees and House administrators to build community following renovation, providing better, more flexible space for House events and more informal gatherings.
However, the actual process of House Renewal—i.e., what happens during renovation—will pose an incredible challenge to the maintenance of House community. While many students opt out of meaningful social involvement in their houses, trading Stein Clubs and intramurals for athletic teams, their extracurricular groups, or final clubs, for some, the House community is at the center of social life.  It is where certain students spend much of their time, it has provided them with some of their closest friends, and it offers a sense of comfort, belonging, and ownership over space on campus. Discussions of how the Houses can be even more central to campus-wide student life prevent us from recognizing that the process of House Renewal itself threatens whatever community, however limited, currently exists.
As questions of where students will move during House Renewal begin to swirl—my brother and his blocking group wondered out loud about what Old Quincy’s renovation would mean for them—it is difficult to expect that House communities will not be shaken by impending relocation. When entire incoming classes are relocated into swing spaces, it is likely that geographic distance from the House will isolate even more students from House community. DeWolfe stands as an example of how geography can hinder House involvement; students opting to live there generally recognize that, despite better housing, additional effort and commitment are needed to remain involved in House life. As increasing numbers of students are dispersed into swing spaces, distance and distraction caused by renovation may limit involvement by those students who could benefit most from House life. During renovation, the administration and the House administrators should do everything in their power to ensure that swing spaces are as geographically close as possible to their residents’ Houses. HoCos operating in Houses undergoing Renewal should receive additional support and resources in order to overcome the inconveniences and difficulties imposed by large-scale renovation. And the university should announce plans for swing housing as soon as possible. This way the Houses can begin to identify ways to maintain a connection between existent House community and students living in swing spaces
I welcome House Renewal and am thrilled that my brother will be part of the first group of students to reap its benefits. However, attention needs to be focused on ensuring that, for those students who do look to their House for a sense of belonging, the physical disruptions caused by the process of House Renewal do not hinder students’ House experiences. While one year of renovation may not be significant in the history of the University or even the overall House Renewal process, a single year of banishment to a distant swing space can dramatically reshape a student’s connection to his or her House and experience of Harvard. The University must pay as much attention to what happens to students during the process of Renewal as it does to House Renewal’s eventual benefits for students who enter an already-redesigned House. I am envious that my brother will see House Renewal during his time at Harvard, but, as he transitions into our House, I am less confident that he will have access to the same resources and community that I have had. Only if students like him can access House community during Renewal, not just before and after it, will Harvard succeed in building the social, residential, and academic community that all students deserve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The end of this school year will mark the one-year anniversary for Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, and the four-year anniversary of the tempest that swept him to the helm of one of the University’s most prominent professional schools. Nohria took charge at a time when HBS faced charges that its graduates played an outsize role in facilitating the financial crisis, and when the positive social value of an HBS education was in question. As Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana told the Wall Street Journal in February 2011, “It's not clear what the purpose of business education is. It's got to be more than high-paying jobs and more than a place to build elite social networks."
Nohria has since been a vocal advocate for business schools that teach “judgment” skills as well as traditional analytical skills. Thus, in January, HBS announced that it would considerably retool its existing M.B.A. program to include a new set of course requirements that stress teamwork and ethics. As of now, one out of the ten required courses, Leadership and Corporate Accountability, deals with questions of ethics.
True, a short-term review of Nohria’s tenure is somewhat facetious. Institutional change is not easy to effect, let alone at a place like Harvard in which so many have a stake. It would be fairer to rate Nohria and the HBS leadership at ten years out rather than one. In that sense, then, the question that the aspiring managers across the river should ask is this: If HBS continues on its present path, what will be its projected social value in ten years?
Frankly, we are not certain it will be much more than it is now. Firstly, HBS has yet to articulate that social impact is part of its educational mission, and, additionally, the change HBS seeks to make cannot be effected without changing the composition of its student body.
Like all of Harvard’s professional schools, the business school should be a tool to stimulate social cohesion rather than individual advancement. This seems obvious—why invest institutional resources in a professional school that actively or passively hurts society by funneling its resources for the benefit of a chosen few? However, HBS’s rhetoric regarding its expectations of its graduates is appallingly neutral when considered on the spectrum of Harvard schools in general.
The Graduate School of Education writes that its mission is: “To prepare leaders in education and to generate knowledge to improve student opportunity, achievement, and success.” The Medical School articulates that what it means to be a Harvard doctor is “innovating, educating, discovering, serving.” The Law  School says that “public service [is] at the heart of the experience.” Even the College, which largely suffices with being a mechanism for social advancement by reaching out across the world to the most talented potential undergraduates from a plurality of backgrounds, writes, regarding its outcomes, that, “Harvard students are very well prepared for service to society.” In contrast, “service” is conspicuously absent from the rhetoric and mentality with which HBS markets itself to prospective students. In this sense, it will be difficult for HBS to work toward increasing its social value if it never explicitly sets this as a school-wide goal and positions itself this way to prospective students.
Along these lines, the best way to promote the M.B.A. with social value is to admit students who believe that business should have a positive social impact, and who show promise of using new management skills to facilitate hard skills. As a professional school, HBS still produces mostly consultants and financiers; 34 percent of 2010 graduates went into the financial services industry, and 24 percent went into consulting. By the same token, only 23 percent went into the healthcare, nonprofit/government, entertainment/media, and technology industries combined. And these statistics are even more notable when one considers that only 14 percent of the HBS Class of 2012 comes from the financial services industry to begin with, and only 22 percent comes from a consulting background.
HBS continues to educate leaders of a very specific subset of the American economy, and in this context, changing the curriculum is a small detail . A handful of required courses cannot moderate the instincts cultivated in many of the preceding industries that dominate HBS classrooms.
Instead, HBS should look to educate students who will use their business educations for the best ends. This means seeking to admit more students from backgrounds in industries such as technology, healthcare, and media who will use their skills for the benefit of society at large.
HBS is already starting to do this with its 2 + 2 program, which accepts undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds to HBS on the condition that they do two years of work experience first. This program seeks to engage students who might have otherwise not considered a business education, such as students from technology or healthcare backgrounds. In a testament to its ability to temper the otherwise-homogenous aspirations of the business school student body, HBS is expanding the 2 + 2 application process; there are now four different rounds of applications and decisions to which rising juniors or seniors can apply.
This is a definite step in the right direction, as the business school should be more than just a finishing school for consultants and financiers. Business is the operating hand of economics—in layman’s terms, the mechanism by which things get done in our society. In that sense, the business school's role on our campus is particularly important, and it should continue to take special care to facilitate the public good. To that end, emphasizing fair play through class is a notable but inadequate step toward accomplishing this goal. More must be done.
Two weeks ago, Nohria spoke in the “Conversations with Kirkland” series, and stressed that HBS students should think globally and aim to be global leaders. In one of his first addresses to the HBS community last year, he said many of the same things, asking, “How can we best bring the world to HBS? How can we best bring HBS to the world?” But before we bring the Business School to the wider world, we must ensure that its mission and its students are committed to serving that world well.

The Undergraduate Council voted unanimously to pass the Harvard for Japan Act at last night’s meeting.
The act offers tentative financial support for the various campus initiatives that are aimed at providing aid to the victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
The act—which was created to provide funds and manpower for the various student initiatives that have taken shape—was passed in the wake of week long efforts by various student organizations.
The Council did not designate a specific amount of money that they would offer groups.
“Hopefully we will be able to provide additional funding if it is requested,” Senan Ebrahim ’12, UC President, said.
Harvard for Japan Movement and the Harvard Asian American Association co-sponsored the act and have already begun to work with the Council to publicize events.
“We have already been working with various student organizations, whether or not we had the sponsorship,” Ebrahim said.
With the official sponsorship now in place, Ebrahim said he hopes to see an increase in the publicity of various events and the provision of more funding if it is requested.
The Harvard for Japan Movement, whose main sponsor has been the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, could benefit from an additional funding source as its leaders plan events for this week and next.
The movement will launch tonight with a candlelight vigil at Memorial Church, which Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds is expected to attend. Later in the week, other events will include an origami workshop, a movie screening, and a benefit concert in Sanders Theatre.
Hiroko Kumaki ’11, a leading figure of the Harvard for Japan Movement and co-sponsor of the act, said she was impressed with the responsiveness of not only the UC, but the entire college community.
“We didn’t think the response would be this big,” Kumaki said. “Even when everyone was out on spring break, it has been great.”
While the movement has gained momentum quickly and will continue to grow over the course of the next two weeks, Kumaki said she hopes it will be able to last for two years if necessary—however long it takes for Japan to fully recover.
“We are hoping this will be a long term effort,” Kumaki said. “The destruction has been indescribable and we are hoping that this can provide an alliance that can help other organizations come together and keep going.”

After months of deliberation and planning, the Boston Redevelopment Authority—which oversees the City’s development projects—unanimously approved Harvard’s plan to replace the currently vacated WGBH radio station building with an Innovation Lab.
The $20 million I-Lab will provide a space where local businesses, non-profits, entrepreneurs, and University affiliates can discuss and realize their business plans through collaboration and coaching.
“The Innovation Lab is an entirely new model for Harvard. It is an innovation in and of itself,” said Gabe Handel, the managing director of the Harvard Business School Dean’s office.
The Small Business Administration, Service Corps of Retired Executives, Center for Women & Enterprise, and Massachusetts Small Business Development Center Network will work with the I-Lab to provide coaching, counseling, and workshops.
“We are thrilled that this incredible resource is coming to Allston,” wrote BRA spokesperson Susan Elsbree in an email. “Boston, our local businesses, neighbors, and the entire region will benefit from the programs and resources that Harvard University will provide through this lab.”
The I-Lab is equipped with a coffee shop and a 24/7 public meeting space, and will host networking events, presentations, and lectures for residents, small business owners, faculty, and students across Harvard’s schools. Harvard will provide transportation to and from the Lab.
“For Harvard to offer their services in any way they can to the surrounding community benefits anyone,” said Jason Patnode, the incoming president of the Brighton Board of Trade. “The help people might not otherwise be able to receive will be great.”
President Drew G. Faust wrote in a letter to Allston-Brighton residents that the Lab, slated to open in September, supports Mayor Thomas Menino’s “innovation agenda” intended to find new community solutions through interdisciplinary collaboration.
“I think it’s a good plus to the community because there’s a component that will be available to people who want to take advantage of those services,” Allston Task Force Chair Ray Mellone said.
Mellone, though retired himself, said he could envision the advantages it will provide the community.
The Lab will occupy 125 Western Ave., sitting almost directly across from the now paved-over five-acre plot that was intended for the Science Complex, a project now indefinitely halted due to financial constraints.
“It will invite the community and the academic constituencies of Harvard to learn and work together,” wrote Handel in an email. “Harvard has powerful incentives for ensuring that community members participate in the Innovation Lab’s programs.”

University President Drew G. Faust wrote in a letter to Allston residents last week that Harvard continues to make progress on a three-phase plan outlined in her last letter, adding that Harvard continues to lease land in the neighborhood, extend short-term lease contracts, and make plots more attractive to buyers.
But residents also continue to express frustration about the pace of progress and what they say is a lack of transparency in the planning process.
After the halt on construction on the $1 billion Allston Science Complex in December 2009, administrators said that Harvard would focus on property stewardship and community engagement, planning and greening, and campus development.
Faust wrote in her letter last week that the number of properties available for leasing has increased and the length of short-term contracts has been extended. Over the past year, 11 new leases have been signed. Harvard also anticipates that the opening of two new restaurants—Stone Hearth Pizza and Maki Maki—and a new retail and commercial bakery, Swiss Bakers, which recently signed a lease with the University will create 90 new jobs in the neighborhood.
“Ours is a common future,” Faust wrote. “We are working toward that future, and along the way, we will be investing in the health and well-being of this unique, historic neighborhood and the City of Boston.”
But residents said that while the University has made progress on some issues in the community, it has remained mum on long-term plans about its large property holdings.
“The letter didn’t say a whole lot about the questions everyone in Allston have, which are ‘What is Harvard going to do with the Science Complex site? The Charlesview site? The dozens of acres of properties that Harvard has?’ We’re still waiting for answers to those questions,” Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said.
Faust wrote that the Work Team—created shortly after the University announced that it would halt construction indefinitely on the Allston Science Complex due to financial constraints—is currently gathering information to determine the most effective ways of expanding into Allston and reinvigorating Western Ave. The team’s recommendations are due this summer and will be delivered to Faust.
The University is also working alongside the Boston Redevelopment Authority on putting together a series of public discussions that will focus on how to best provide benefits for the Allston community in the next two to five years while the University determines how to move forward on its plans to develop property in Allston.
The discussions will also cover what standards should be included in leasing guidelines and what types of properties should be pursued.
Allston residents said yesterday that they found the proposed dialogue between the University and the community an encouraging sign.
“What we need is some strategic thinking, so I applaud Harvard for finally coming to the table with that,” Tim McHale said.
The University also has plans to build an Innovation Lab—a space where residents and University affiliates could meet to discuss business plans—which Faust has said she hopes will spur economic innovation and generate jobs in the community.
“We believe that these discussions ... will provide tangible near-term results while being consistent with any longer-term path to a comprehensive revitalization of Western Avenue and key locations where campus and community will intersect in the future,” Faust wrote.
But Mattison said that community members had sent a letter that included a list of features that they hoped to see in the I-Lab but that University administrators had ignored their suggestions.
“It shows that it’s a Harvard project for Harvard people. But the project is and always has been for Harvard people to start great businesses,” Mattison said. “There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s certainly not a project creating local businesses in Allston.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two male graduate students were robbed on Friday, March 11, according to a community advisory sent by the Harvard University Police Department.
The victims were walking along Mass. Ave. near the 1700 block at about 1:45 p.m. when two unidentified males approached them from behind and demanded their money and cellphones.
According to the Cambridge Police Department’s report, one suspect asked for the time, and one victim responded that it was 1:45 p.m.
The two graduate students started to walk away, but the two males approached them again and asked what types of cellphones they had.
One graduate student said they did not have cellphones, and the two students started crossing the street. The suspects then told the graduate students to turn around.
One suspect told the victims “my buddy has a big cannon.” The other suspect placed a hand in his pant pocket, and the victims reported that they believed this “gesture was meant to insinuate the presence of a firearm.”
The victims then tried to negotiate with the suspects so that they would not have to give up their cellphones, offering money instead.
One victim handed the suspects $60, and the other victim handed the suspects between $100 and $200. The two suspects left the scene heading northward on Mass. Ave. toward Porter Square.
A witness reported that the two suspects were seen in the area about 15 minutes prior to the robbery.
Neither victim was injured during the incident, and both refused medical assistance.
HUPD reminded students that if someone approaches displaying a weapon and demanding property, it is recommended that the victim complies with the request and not resist.

Blayn Jiggetts and Jason Aquino—two of the three men implicated in the May 2009 Kirkland House shooting—have made an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for cooperating with the district attorney’s office.
Originally charged with first-degree murder, Aquino now faces the lesser charge of manslaughter after agreeing to cooperate with Middlesex District Attorney Gerard T. Leone, Jr. ’85 in a case against Jabrai Jordan Copney—who allegedly shot Justin Cosby—according to the Boston Globe.
Aquino now faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail after making the agreement with prosecutors.
Although Jiggetts will also face prison time, George Murphy, Jiggetts’s attorney, declined to comment to the Globe on the nature of his client’s sentencing.
Jiggetts took the stand Friday against Brittany J. Smith, a former Harvard student and Copney’s former girlfriend, at the Middlesex Superior Court, according to the Globe. During her arraignment last March, Smith pleaded not guilty to charges of accessory after the fact of murder and several other charges related to the shooting.
At Friday’s hearing, her defense attorney, John Osler, tried to get the court to throw out all criminal charges against her, according to the Globe.
Smith originally signed a non-prosecution agreement in exchange for agreeing to divulge everything she knew about the shooting. Prosecutors allege that Smith withheld information related to the case and therefore reneged on her agreement, the Globe wrote.
Aquino, Jiggetts, and Copney all previously pleaded not guilty to the murder.
Copney allegedly shot Justin Cosby, a Cambridge Rindge and Latin graduate who did not attend Harvard, on May 18, 2009 during what investigators have called a failed “drug rip.”
Leone said in 2009 that Copney, Aquino, and Jiggetts had initially planned to steal drugs and money from Cosby.
Cosby allegedly sold drugs to Harvard students.
Police reportedly recovered a pound of marijuana and approximately $1,000 from the crime scene, Leone said.
The four men met in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway shortly before 5 p.m. that night.
According to a police report, a struggle broke out between Cosby and the three suspects. Jiggetts allegedly drew a gun, which he then passed to Copney.
Copney allegedly fired three shots, one of which fatally wounded Cosby.
Cosby fled Kirkland House and travelled up Dunster Street towards Mt. Auburn Street.
Witnesses reported that Cosby, who was bleeding from his lower torso, collapsed on the ground and asked for water.
He was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where his mother Denise Cosby, said he died hours later.
Smith called a cab and used the driver’s phone to help Copney, Aquino, and Jiggetts escape, Leone said in a March 2010 press release.
The three men then took a bus from South Station to New York, where all three men are from.
Smith allegedly hid the murder weapon, lied to the police, and misled the grand jury when she testified.
When Smith returned to Harvard the day after the shooting, she told the police that her boyfriend’s name was Jordan Coombs and that he left the University hours before the murder, according to Leone.
Chanequa N. Campbell, a former undergraduate, previously denied any involvement in the incident and has not been charged to date, but on Friday, according to the Globe, she admitted to making drug deals with Copney.
The University denied both Smith and Campbell their diplomas in 2009.

One man was pronounced dead after a shooting in Cambridge on Saturday, March 12, according to a press release from the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, representing the first murder in Cambridge in more than a year.
Two victims were transported to area hospitals after a double shooting occurred at the intersection of Watson and Brookline Streets at 12:15 a.m.
The two victims initially drove away from the scene and flagged down a fire truck. The police were alerted, and the two victims were taken to area hospitals. James Lauture, 30, was pronounced dead. The second victim is expected to survive.
According to a statement from Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello, Cambridge Police officers and detectives “canvassed the neighborhood and spoke to residents in the aftermath of the homicide this weekend.”
The investigation is currently being investigated by CPD and State Police. No arrests have been made, and authorities do not believe the shooting was random.
The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will be conducting the autopsy. The investigation remains ongoing.
“Although this investigation is still very active, our investigators are more certain than ever that this was not a random event and the public should not fear for their safety,” said Riviello in a statement to The Crimson.
In early February, the Cambridge Police Department announced that Cambridge had no murders in 2010—the fourth year to do so in the last 50 years.Other years without a homicide include 1985, 2004, and 2007. Between 1960 and 1989, Cambridge averaged less than five murders per year, and since 1990 the annual average for the city has fallen to two murders per year, according to Cambridge police.
The police report for the incident is being held because the investigation is still open.

After an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan on March 11, Harvard students have been fundraising and planning events, including a banquet two nights ago and a week-long schedule of events which begin today.
Since the natural disasters devastated Japan, Jessica W. Li ’14 decided to host a small banquet to raise money for the Japanese Red Cross.
“A lot of events were happening after spring break, but why not now?” Li said she asked herself at the time.
Li posted her idea on her Facebook, and in a few hours preparations were underway for the “Harvard Students for Japan: Banquet.”
Sakura Huang ’13, who volunteered for the banquet, said she thought the event was perfect for spring break since dining halls were closed.
“There’s no food on campus, so this is definitely the way to do it,” Huang said.
At the event Saturday, there were more than 60 volunteers and donations from 15 restaurants in Harvard Square and Boston’s Chinatown.
Li said that the event was well attended, despite taking place during spring break.
“We expected 200 people. There were well over 300 people in attendance,”  Li said.
Raising $3,246, Li and her team of volunteers said they considered the event a success.
Like Li, another Harvard undergraduate, Hiroko Kumaki ’11, wanted to find a way to help.
Kumaki, who is from the earthquake devastated city of Sendai, met Keisuke Ishihara, a graduate student. The two organized a team to create the Harvard for Japan movement—an umbrella movement to help coordinate the University’s response to the disaster. As of Sunday afternoon, the movement had co-signatures from more than 50 organizations.
Currently partnering with the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies and the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at the Weatherhead Center, the Harvard for Japan movement is spearheading Harvard for Japan Week.
The week will begin with a candlelight vigil at 8 p.m. tonight on the steps of Memorial Church. The daily events, which are posted online, include an origami workshop in Quincy and Pfoho dining halls, a faculty panel discussion, a film night, and a Bach Society Orchestra Charity Concert. The week ends with a Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association Benefit Concert on Saturday.
All week, there will be fundraising activities in front of the Science Center, during which time students can receive “Hope for Japan 2011” bracelets in exchange for a donation.
Hiroko and her team also provided a space in the conference room of the Reischauer Institute for inter-school dialogue for the entire Harvard community.
The various Harvard Graduate Schools came to talk with Kumaki’s team about various initiatives which were taking place across campus, including an off-campus comedy show hosted by the Graduate School of Design and a sushi party sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School.
Student organizers acknowledged that spring break has made organization difficult at times, but said they felt encouraged that the student body, Harvard administrators, and Harvard faculty seemed to be paying attention to the disaster and willing to help.  “I’m encouraged that my resident dean, my House Master, and my friends all have contacted me showing their support,” Kumaki said. “Dean [of the Colllege Evelynn M.] Hammonds emailed me directly. For the college, she’s been great, literally great.”
Huang said she was shocked by the enthusiasm and energy that brought students together.
“I’m inspired by what happened,” Huang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though dangerous levels of radioactivity still pose a threat to the population around the deteriorating nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Power Plant in Japan, Harvard professors say that while the disaster may cause dangerous pollution, its consequences will not reach the most dire predictions.
According to Physics Professor Emeritus Richard Wilson, the fallout from the nuclear reactor explosions in Japan should be nowhere near the level of the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, when a Soviet nuclear power plant suffered a meltdown and irradiated many in the area.
Wilson said that the catastrophe in Japan, caused by a 9.0 earthquake that rocked Japan on March 11 and triggered a massive tsunami, is not as bad as it could have been.
“It’s not completely out of the woods, but it’s almost so,” he said. “It’s certainly not as bad as some said it would be.”
Currently the greatest risk to the population is radioactive isotopes of gases like iodine-131 and cesium-137, both of which can contribute to an increase in cancer rates and the possible contamination of food, Wilson said.
He also said that there is little chance of acute radiation sickness in areas surrounding the power plant. According to Wilson, current levels of radioactive pollution being emitted by the plants are insufficient to trigger the sickness.
But radiation levels are significantly higher for workers inside the plant. The Japanese government recently increased the permitted level of radiation exposure for workers in order to allow for a skeleton crew to remain on the site of the stricken reactors.
But according to Medical School Associate Professor Jeffrey R. Garber, a nuclear disaster like the one playing out in northern Japan can also include dangerous ramifications from counterfeit medicines that are peddled as a preventive counter-measure for radiation sickness.
Garber said that potassium iodide that has began to circulate in response to the demand for the compound for its properties that keeps peoples’ thyroids from being contaminated by radioactive iodine.
“The three largest suppliers have sold more of it in three days than three years,” he said. “This created a vacuum in the market that led to an opportunity for some to put out counterfeits into the market.”
These black market counterfeit drugs can have fatal consequences and could cause a number of unforeseen consequences as they are not regulated by the government and could contain any combination of unknown substances.
While iodine-131 can be neutralized by potassium iodide, radioactive cesium-137 carries greater long-term risks. The latter isotope can pollute the soil and enter the food supply through milk. If cows ingest, for example, grass that has been polluted by cesium-137, the milk that they produce also becomes toxic, which poses a health risk for the general population.
Radioactive milk was one of the main causes of death in the aftermath of the disaster in Chernobyl as the population unknowingly ingested contaminated milk.
Cesium-137 also has a half-life of more than 30 years, meaning that the isotope could pose a long-term threat to the environment and the population.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the Islamic leader who rose to prominence through his proposal to build a mosque near Ground Zero and the first imam to speak at Memorial Church, called for spiritual unity at a time of conflicts among different faiths during a sermon yesterday.
“There is more than one right way to love God, more than one language, more than one liturgy to love God in. This is part of the divine intent,” Rauf said, emphasizing a spiritual brotherhood of the “Abrahamic faith traditions.”
In his sermon, Rauf drew upon his own complicated personal history and upbringing. Born in Kuwait, Rauf has lived in the United Kingdom, Malaysia, and now the United States. Constant moves from one cultural context to another, Rauf said, led to a lack of spiritual identity in his early life.
“I didn’t know who I was,” he said. “I always asked myself, ‘Who am I? What am I?’ This is what prompted the beginning of my spiritual journey.”
But Rauf—the chairman of the Cordoba Initiative, which seeks to improve relations between the West and Muslim communities—said that his geographic journey from led him to see parallels between different world religions, which he used to urge for cooperation and sympathy between followers of different faiths.
“The longing to reconnect with God,” he said, “is what this journey is all about in all religions.”
According to Associate Minister Dorothy A. Austin, Memorial Church has invited Muslims to speak to its congregation in the past, but Rauf is the first imam to give a sermon.
“This is a great moment for interfaith relations,” Austin said, adding that in the past rabbis and the Dalai Lama have spoken at Memorial Church but never an imam—until now.
Rauf said that he was originally invited to give a sermon at Memorial Church over a year ago by the recently deceased Reverend Peter J. Gomes, but Rauf fell ill and was unable to speak at the church until yesterday.
Though Rauf acknowledged the historic political upheaval currently playing out in the Middle East, he said his presence at Memorial Church is more a testament to interfaith relations than politics.
“[Being here] feels historic. It feels we are breaking the walls that divide us,” he said, adding that sooner is better than never. “If not now, when?” Rauf said.
Rauf’s sermon was mostly devoid of political content and did not address the controversy surrounding a proposed mosque near Ground Zero that catapulted him onto the national stage.
But Rauf also addressed the escalating crisis in Libya and said that American values would aid the protestors there.
“The more we do to stand for these principles—fight for the rights of the people, the rights of the masses—the more the world will love [the United States],” he said.
Bridging the gap between Muslims and Christians, Rauf’s sermon, which was heavily interfaith and focused on the quest to discover one’s spirituality, garnered support and praise from Harvard University students and faculty in attendance.
Diana L. Eck, professor of comparative religion and Indian studies, said Rauf’s sermon was “extraordinary spiritual advice preached by a Muslim but on the basis of a common word that Christians and Muslims share—love of God and of neighbor. It was a real sermon.”
Rauf began his sermon by singing the Islamic call to prayer, which surprised attendee James W. Dewhurst, an exchange student from England at the College.
“I thought, this is incredibly risky ground,” he said, concerned about how the congregation would react to such a call. “It sets a breathtaking paradigm. I’ve never seen anything like that before. It’s refreshing.”
Austin said that by opening his sermon in a traditional Muslim fashion Rauf had broken new ground in the history of Harvard’s church.
“As I sat there,” Austin said, “I thought, I have lived to hear the call to prayer in Memorial Church.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last few games of its trip down South, the Harvard men’s baseball squad (1-13, 0-0 Ivy) looked to improve upon a difficult start to the season against a talented Charlotte team.
Despite a strong defensive effort, the 49ers (15-5, 0-0 A10) won three straight games at home over the Crimson, as scoring droughts continued to plague Harvard.
“I think we improved over the [course of the trip],” said senior right-handed pitcher Max Perlman. “Obviously it was a tough weekend for us, but there were a lot of positives...It’s all there, we just need to put it all together.”
CHARLOTTE 7, HARVARD 2
After a two-inning stalemate, Charlotte was first to light up the scoreboard in yesterday’s matchup, as sophomore infielder Justin Roland crossed the plate for the 49ers in the third.
Charlotte stretched its lead to three by the end of the inning and took a commanding 5-0 advantage by the end of the fifth.
It wasn’t until the ninth inning—after the 49ers had increased their comfortable lead to seven—that Harvard scored its only two runs of the weekend.
After being hit by a pitch, junior second baseman Jeff Reynolds stole second as another ball got away from Charlotte sophomore Wes Hatley, and a double from freshman center fielder Steven Dill sent the junior home.
Senior right-handed pitcher Andrew Hatch crossed the plate for the Crimson soon after, taking advantage of yet another wild pitch from the 49ers.
For the third straight afternoon, Harvard had its chances—including seven hits—but was unable to capitalize on a majority of scoring opportunities.
“We’ve been hitting okay,” Reynolds said. “We just can’t string a few together. When we do get on base, we’ve been hitting it right at people.”
CHARLOTTE 7, HARVARD 0
The 49ers continued to shut down Harvard’s attack in Saturday’s game, holding Crimson batters to just four hits in 31 at-bats.
“We faced really good pitching this weekend,” Perlman said. “We need to communicate...and focus on the little things. We showed flashes of great play, and we played good defense the entire week. Now it’s about putting it all together.”
The second game was much closer than indicated by the score, as Harvard and Charlotte were tied, 0-0, until the 49ers earned a 1-0 advantage in the fifth.
A six-run seventh inning by the hosts pushed the game out of reach for the Crimson. Harvard rallied for two hits in the seventh and one in the eighth but did not share its opponent’s scoring success.
Senior left-handed pitcher Eric Eadington played well for the Crimson, allowing just one run in six innings and keeping the Crimson in the game.
CHARLOTTE 2, HARVARD 0
In what was perhaps the best defensive effort of the weekend, Harvard held Charlotte to just two runs but lost a tight matchup last Friday.
“Defensively, I think we played really well,” Reynolds said. “All of our pitchers threw well and gave us a chance. We just have to figure out ways to score, how to push it across the plate.”
Crimson hurlers—led by Perlman—had an especially strong showing, striking out six batters and allowing just one run in seven innings of play.
Despite the disappointing losses to Charlotte, Harvard saw a lot of positives in its performance at the end of break.
“Our pitching is going to be solid and has been pretty solid,” Reynolds said. “Our defense has gotten much better. We’ve been making fewer errors in last few game.”
“We went into this season with pretty high hopes and we still have those,” Perlman continued. “This week has humbled us, and I think the experience will prepare us for the Ivy League season. We need to work hard this week and we’ll be ready to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second weekend of spring break proved to be less than perfect for the Harvard softball team, as it traveled to Southern California for the San Diego Classic II.
After losing its first four games, the Crimson (8-8) was finally able to pull out a win with a stellar performance from junior pitcher Rachel Brown in the weekend finale.
The team remains optimistic about its chances in its next few games as it heads back to the East Coast.
“I think we were in a lot of tight games,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We played against a lot of tough teams, but we were in all the games.”
HARVARD 1, SAN DIEGO 0
On Saturday, the Crimson battled San Diego (8-11) in a pitching duel between Brown and Toreros freshman pitcher Cassidy Coleman.
Brown held San Diego to one hit while recording 15 strikeouts. She would have completed the no-hitter, but Toreros freshman left fielder Dana Prelsnik was able to tag an infield single in the final inning.
“We had terrific pitching from Rachel Brown,” Allard said. “I thought she did a really great job. She worked well with her catcher [sophomore Mariel Sena], and the two of them were terrific as a battery today.”
A timely double by junior infielder Mari Zumbro in the second inning gave the Crimson its lone run, and its fielders did their part to keep the San Diego offense in check.
“We played flawless defense today,” Brown said. “Honestly, we were tired of losing. We were hungry to win.”
OHIO STATE 4, HARVARD 1
In the second game on Friday, Brown held Ohio State (7-16) scoreless through four innings, but late offense from the Buckeyes gave them the three-run victory.
In the fifth, Crimson junior infielder Jane Alexander hit a double to left center, and freshman infielder Kasey Lange followed later in the frame with a double of her own, scoring Alexander and putting Harvard up, 1-0.
But the Crimson could not muster any more offense, and the Buckeyes broke through and scored two runs each in the fifth and the sixth inning.
Harvard left six runners on base, and the offense managed only five hits.
“We just need to capitalize on our opportunities,” Allard said. “We have to learn to convert the opportunities on base into runs.”
OHIO 2, HARVARD 1
The Crimson faced off against Ohio (10-7) in another pitcher’s duel in Friday’s first game, but its offense again came up short in a 2-1 loss.
The Bobcats jumped out early with an RBI double from senior outfielder Melissa Bonner in the first inning and a run on a fielder’s choice in the third.
Harvard responded with a run of its own in the bottom of the third with a sacrifice fly from sophomore outfielder Stephanie Regan, but the Crimson was blanked for the rest of the game after the score.
Harvard freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone only allowed five hits, but Ohio’s two runs were enough to secure the victory.
Crimson captain Ellen Macadam finished with two hits and a run scored.
SAN DIEGO STATE 4, HARVARD 3
On Thursday, Harvard squared off against a strong San Diego State team (16-14), but a late-inning comeback wasn’t enough for the Crimson in the loss.
The Aztecs were able to break a scoreless tie in the fourth when junior infielder Justeen Maeva homered off Brown, who delivered 11 strikeouts and only allowed four hits and one earned run.
The Crimson responded quickly in a big fourth inning with Regan’s two-RBI single, but San Diego State found a way to score three more runs in the sixth and the seventh, putting Harvard down 4-2 heading into the bottom of the last inning.
In the seventh, Alexander doubled to left field and scored on a fielding error by the Aztecs. But the final two Harvard batters struck out, ending the Crimson’s comeback bid.
WISCONSIN 7, HARVARD 4
In the opener against Wisconsin (15-9), Harvard faced a familiar foe, having played the Badgers two days earlier at Loyola Marymount.
The first two innings were costly for the Crimson, as three errors allowed Wisconsin to jump out to a 7-0 lead.
In the fourth, Harvard was able to cut into the lead, scoring three runs.
An RBI single by Lange led to another run in the sixth, but the Crimson offense could not rally to erase the seven-run deficit.
“We were certainly disappointed that we didn’t win more games,” Brown said. “Still, we stuck with every team that we played.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The graduation of J.P. O’Connor ’10—last year’s NCAA national champion in the 157-lb class—and Louis Caputo ’10—a two-time All-American—left the Harvard wrestling squad with a lot to live up to.
And at this year’s NCAA Championships in the City of Brotherly Love, two Harvard wrestlers, sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman and sophomore Steven Keith, did their best to match those expectations.
The Crimson finished 35th overall with 12.5 team points, but the No. 11 seed Peppelman earned eighth place and All-America honors for the first time in his collegiate wrestling career, while Keith went 1-2 for the tournament and ended his sophomore year with a 23-17 record.
Peppelman capped off his season with a 33-7 record, the seventh-most wins in a season in Harvard history.
“Our whole goal of the program is to make an impact at the national tournament,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Coming back with an All-American with only two guys out there is a huge success. That’s what we shoot for.”
Competing in the same weight class as O’Connor, Peppelman had a lot on his shoulders heading into competition. But he seized the moment early on and breezed through his first-round match, pinning Vincent Salminen of North Dakota State in just 32 seconds.
Despite the easy victory, Peppelman could not carry the momentum over into the second round against No. 6 Derek St. John of Iowa.
St. John started out with an early lead over Peppelman and never let up against his opponent on his way to an 8-2 victory.
Peppelman turned things around the second day of the tournament.
The No. 11 seed went 3-1 for the day, starting out with a 10-7 win over DJ Meagher of Cornell. Peppelman secured the victory in the third period by taking down his Ivy opponent in their third match-up of the year.
Next Peppelman displayed another dominant performance over Northern Iowa’s David Bonin, pinning him in a mere 39 seconds.
He followed that up with a come-from-behind 6-4 victory over No. 12 Paul Young.
In his fourth match of the day, Peppelman had the edge against No. 1 seed Adam Hall with a 10-4 lead, but then Hall pinned him 40 seconds into the second period when Peppelman went in for a takedown.
“It was really disappointing,” Peppelman said. “It is a learning experience, and I won’t let it happen again. It was just a lack of focus.”
Due to the loss against Hall, Peppelman was battling for seventh place. Peppelman stayed close to No. 7 Bryce Saddoris, but ultimately lost, 4-3.
Peppelman had led, 3-2, with just three seconds left in the match, but Saddoris pulled out another takedown to eke out the win.
The loss meant Peppelman landed in eighth for the tournament.
“I was happy with coming out with All-American,” Peppelman said. “It showed me some things I could work on for next year. It was a lot of fun and really exciting.”
Keith was not as fortunate as Peppelman, starting out the first day of the tournament by splitting two matches at 125 lbs.
In the first match, Keith pulled out a 1-0 decision against West Virginia’s Shane Young.
The only point of the bout came in the third period, when Keith earned an escape for a point.
Keith had a much tougher challenge against top-seeded Anthony Robles of Arizona State. The senior—who went on to win the 125-lb title—commanded the entire match, dominating Keith, 15-0.
Keith’s sophomore season came to an end against Eastern Michigan’s Trent Sprenkle the next day when he lost, 10-5. Sprenkle took the lead early on, but Keith fought back to bring the score to 9-5.
Despite his comeback efforts, it was not enough, and Keith lost his second match of the tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in its first Ivy League matchup of the season, the Crimson men’s lacrosse team (5-1, 1-0 Ivy) outlasted Brown (2-3, 0-1) on the road in Providence, R.I., on Saturday afternoon, 11-7.
Harvard’s current record marks the team’s best start to the season since the 2000 campaign, when it began the year 5-0 but lost six of its final eight.
“We’re excited about the start [to the season],” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “But we still have our best lacrosse to come...we’re certainly happy with how we started, but we as a team are not about how we start, but how we finish.”
Coming off three straight wins beginning with a victory over the 20th-ranked Georgetown Hoyas, Harvard again kept things tight in the first three periods but used a strong fourth period—in which the Crimson out-scored the Bears, 3-0—to pull away.
Led by hat tricks from co-captain attack Dean Gibbons and sophomore midfielder Ryan Stevens, Harvard notched its first win over Brown since 2007.
“It’s our first time beating Brown in three years, losing in close games each time,” junior attack Jeff Cohen said. “So it’s important to start the Ivy League season off with a win.”
The Crimson came out of the gate shooting, accounting for the first six attempts of the game.
The attack was capped with a goal by Gibbons to give Harvard an early lead with 12:11 remaining in the first period.
The Bears won the ensuing faceoff and traded possessions with the Crimson until finally putting it away on a goal by Brown sophomore midfielder Johnny DePeters with 7:30 on the clock.
Within two minutes, Gibbons added his second tally of the game to give Harvard a 2-1 lead going into the second period.
“I was really impressed with how we played today,” sophomore goalie Harry Krieger said. “Both our offense and our defense seemed to really be clicking.”
In the opening four minutes of the second period, the Crimson extended its lead on goals from Cohen and junior midfielder Terry White to open up a three-goal advantage.
But the Bears were not quite ready to roll over.
Brown responded with four goals of its own, including two from senior Andrew Feinberg, to take the lead with 2:14 to play in the period.
For Harvard, which had to come back from an early deficit against Holy Cross earlier in the week, it seemed it would take another similar effort to come out with the win on its rival’s field.
The comeback began with a Crimson goal just 40 seconds later by junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan on a second-chance opportunity after a missed shot by White.
Although the game went into the locker room tied, 5-5, Harvard would never be down again.
“Keep doing what were doing,” said Wojcik of what he told his team at halftime. “We have confidence in our strategy and our players, and we knew our shots would start to go in.”
The second half began with two straight goals by Stevens—both second-chance tries coming off his own misses. The goals helped the Crimson regain control and open up a two-score lead.
With 6:32 to play, sophomore Peter Schwartz committed a penalty, creating an extra-man opportunity for the Bears, which responded within 10 seconds to cut the Harvard lead to 7-6.
Both teams exchanged goals to end the third period, 8-7, with Stevens picking up his third score of the game.
The final period proved to be the end of the road for Brown, which could not match up with the swift attack of the Crimson offense and the strong defense of Krieger.
The sophomore added five saves in the final period, giving him a season-high 13 total saves on the day.
“I think the main reason for my performance was how well our defense played,” Krieger said. “That number also reflects how well the entire defensive front played all game.”
Within 40 seconds of the whistle starting the fourth period, White added his second goal of the game, followed by another Harvard goal just two minutes later by freshman midfielder Daniel Eipp.
The next 12 minutes featured a total of 12 shots, six by each team. The final Crimson shot was the one that found the net, completing the hat trick for Gibbons.
Harvard out-shot the Bears by a margin of 52-33.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After coming up one goal short against both No. 6 Penn and No. 8 Stanford, the young Harvard women’s lacrosse team was still looking for its first signature victory of the season heading into yesterday’s matchup against Johns Hopkins.
An 8-1 run to close out the first and finish the second half gave Harvard what it was searching for and secured a victory over the visiting Blue Jays at Harvard Stadium.
The Crimson’s (2-3, 1-1 Ivy) 12-8 comeback win against the well-respected visitors marked a turning point as Harvard deals with one of the toughest schedules in the country.
“We’ve been very competitive all season long, but I told them at halftime, we have to compete to win, not just compete to compete,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said.
Following a late counterattack goal by Johns Hopkin’s Sarah Taylor, junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind sparked the run with seven seconds left in the first half, scoring off a free-position shot to make the game, 7-5, heading into the break. Baskind would score again in the second half to move her season point total to 11.
Coming out of the break, the hosts kept momentum on their side, rattling off a 7-1 run to close the match.
In contrast to the Harvard-dominated second half, the opening period was a back-and-forth affair. Sophomore attacker Jenn VanderMeulen notched two first-half goals, giving her a team-leading 13 goals on the season. Blue Jays attacker Taylor D’Amore put two in the back of the net as well, including one off a beautiful one-timer assist from Rachel Ballatori.
Junior goalie Kerry Clark kept the Crimson in the game in the first half, only allowing Johns Hopkins to succeed on two of its five free-position shots while notching six saves. With the game in striking distance, Harvard to maintained its confidence and came out of the break with a dominating attack, led by junior Jess Halpern—who finished with a game-high four goals.
“We kept possession of the ball, and it gave everyone more options,” Halpern said. “We spread the defense out and made a lot of space for one another, and I was just fortunate to be in the right place at the right time.”
What Baskind started at the end of the first half turned into four unanswered goals for the Crimson, as Halpern, VanderMeulen and junior Tyler Petropoulos also chipped in to put Harvard ahead, 8-7.
The Blue Jays did not stop the drought until D’Amore scored with 18:10 left in the game to tie it up.
Halpern responded with two goals in less than three minutes, both unassisted and off quick drives coming from the right of the net, putting the Crimson ahead for good.
“I knew they could do it,” Miller said. “They’ve worked hard and they really take care of each other. I’m really happy for them. I’ve had young and talented teams like this before, and it’s great to see things click.”
After Halpern’s goal with 11:40 left, both goalies exchanged big stops, before Harvard instituted a clock-killing offense.
Winning possession with 7:09 left, the Crimson passed the ball around the attacking third before finally getting Baskind open one-on-one with the goalie for a game-sealing goal with 4:09 to go.
An important draw control secured by sophomore Micaela Cyr following the goal allowed Harvard to continue to kill the clock, as the Johns Hopkins defenders hopelessly chased the ball. The victory already in hand, freshman Chelsey Newman knocked one into an open goal with 1:49 left on the clock.
“It felt really good finally getting over the hump,” Halpern said. “We all felt we could have beaten Stanford and Penn, and now, moving into the Ivy season with some momentum, we’re all really excited.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard students were enjoying the final days of their spring break, the women’s water polo team was busy wrapping up their seven-game road trip in California on Friday and Saturday in games against Cal State East Bay and UC Berkeley.
The Crimson (10-9, 1-0 CWPA) only managed to come out of the trip with a 2-5 record, and despite dropping both of this weekend’s matchups, Harvard’s two most recent games were helpful in exposing areas that stil need improvement.
“The week has been a great learning experience,” said sophomore attacker Aisha Price. “We came away with some big wins and also had some tough losses, but through all these wins and losses we were still able to come together and play as a team.”
Junior attacker Shannon Purcell said that the biggest lesson learned over the week was how to handle teams that have a more physical style of play.
“Being in California and playing some of the more aggressive teams was something we needed to get used to,” Purcell said. “So it was nice that we were able to adjust and handle a harder press over the week. We’ve only had one conference game thus far, so we’re in a great position going forward.”
UC BERKELEY 12, HARVARD 4
Harvard was consistent on offense by scoring in all four quarters, but No. 2 Cal (16-3) outscored the visitors, 12-4.
Purcell opened up the offense for the Crimson by scoring the team’s initial goal in the first quarter, cutting UC Berkeley’s lead to 2-1.
“They were double-teaming my teammate, so I was able to sneak past my defender,” Purcell said. “Then I got a pass form the weak side and just shot it right off the pass.”
The Crimson was down 7-2 at halftime, after sophomore two-meter guard Elise Molnar scored Harvard’s only goal in the second quarter. Molnar scored again in the third frame, but the Crimson was unable to mount a comeback.
Freshman attacker Shayna Price gave Harvard its final goal of the game in the fourth quarter, but her efforts were not rewarded, as the homecoming for Crimson assistant coach Jessi Wood, a 2008 Cal graduate, turned bittersweet with the defeat.
CAL STATE EAST BAY 12, HARVARD 8
With great plays on both ends of the pool, Harvard was able to keep up with Cal State East Bay (14-7) through the first three quarters of the game. But the Crimson’s efforts in the final period were not enough to save the team from dropping its fourth game in a row.
Tied 2-2 after the first quarter and 6-6 at halftime, Harvard was outscored, 4-2, in the third quarter and held scoreless in the final frame.
“Both teams came out with great intensity,” Purcell said. “But they were able to push us a little harder and capitalize on their opportunities more than we were.”
The Pioneers were able to fight back from deficits of 2-1 and 5-3 in the first half, and eventually added two goals in the fourth quarter, while the Crimson’s offense struggled to find its stride.
“It was a combination of having a couple of opportunities on goals we couldn’t quite put away and we didn’t get some calls for us,” Price said. “But it was a good learning experience.”
As disappointing as the loss may be, junior Monica Zdrojewski provided a couple of highlights with three goals and a steal. Price also turned in a strong performance with one goal, two assists, and a steal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a solid indoor season, the Harvard track and field team kicked off its outdoor season with a spring break trip to the Lone Star State.
Hoping to carry its momentum, the Crimson competed against Rice University at the Shirley Crowe Combined Events Classic. Harvard’s performance lived up to its post-indoor expectations, as the Crimson finished the meet with event winners on both the men’s and women’s sides.
The Shirley Crowe Combined Events Classic was held at Rice University in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday and Thursday. The dual meet has been a long-standing tradition for the universities, and, due to the two schools’ prestige, has been dubbed, “The Meeting of the Minds.”
Harvard freshman Christina Twicken started her collegiate outdoor career in impressive fashion.
The sprinter from San Clemente, Calif., raced to a win in the 400-meter dash with a time of 55.47.  Classmate Meisha Brooks was hot on Twicken’s tail, finishing a mere 10th of a second behind her counterpart.
“I thought Christina and Meisha ran well,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “Both freshman are having outstanding beginnings to their collegiate careers. I’m very excited for them.”
Following Twicken and Brooks were two more Harvard runners, junior Magda Robak and sophomore Carlyle Davis, giving the team a rare one-through-four finish.
The visiting team also had the top-three finishers in the 400-meter hurdles. Sophomore Melissa Bellin paced the Crimson, finishing with a time of 1:03.54, just off her personal-best time of 1:01.05.
Three of Harvard’s athletes competed in the heptathlon at Rice this week. Of the trio, junior co-captain Nicole Sliva had the best outing.
The multi-event specialist from Monte Sereno, Calif. finished third overall in the heptathlon with a score of 4,433.
On the men’s side, co-captain Brian Hill had a strong meet, as he won the 600-meter run. A pack of five followed Hill for the Crimson, earning third through seventh place. All six of Harvard’s runners finished within five seconds of each other. Hill and the other middle distance runners for the Crimson ran both the 600-meter run and the 4x400-meter relay at Rice. Though it may have been exhausting, competing in two events is something that the senior embraced.
“Most of us doubled up with the 4x400 and the 600 that day,” Hill said. “It was a good training tool that all of us could use to gauge where we are.”
Saretsky said that Hill has been a major contributor for the Crimson for four years.
“[Hill] is our senior captain,” Saretsky said. “He’s a great leader, he always goes out there and competes hard. What he does was on display this week.”
But what was perhaps most demonstrated in the Meeting of the Minds was the strength of Harvard’s throwers. Six Crimson throwers finished in the top two of their individual events.
Sophomore Shannon Watt earned first place in the women’s shot put with a toss of 13.86 meters.
A pair of Crimson throwers, freshman Hannah Mayer and senior Jessica Fronk, took the top-two spots in the javelin with throws of 46.88 and 43.67 meters, respectively.
Not to be outdone by their female counterparts, the Harvard men’s throwing squad also performed well at the invitational.
Senior Eric Clayman threw 56.05 meters in the hammer for first place in the event, while junior Nick Farnsworth picked up a win in the javelin with a 64.65-meter hurl.
“The throwers are really the backbone of our team,” Saretsky said. “I thought they competed extremely well this week.”
Even the Crimson’s runners were quick to compliment the performance put on by the throwers.
“We have a really good throwing squad,” Hill said. “This week, they had a good performance with some [personal records.] They just love getting after it.”
The team is glad to have made the travel to Texas, not just because it gave them an opportunity to escape the New England weather.
“It’s fun to go down to Houston,” Hill said. “We got some warm-weather training in and got to gel as a team. It is a great was to start the spring. We’ll be ready to compete when we get back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson bounced back at the Hilton Mission Valley Spring Classic this weekend in San Diego, Calif., to earn the championship in the consolation bracket.
Harvard (9-7) fell to East Tennessee State (10-6) in the first round of the tournament but then rebounded in consolation play with a 6-1 victory over University of Alabama-Birmingham (4-7) and a 4-3 win over the University of Denver (3-10).
“[Playing against East Tennessee] was a good chance for us to see high-level, patient tennis on a slow hard court,” said Harvard assistant coach Andrew Rueb. “We learned a lot of from that match and used what we learned in the next two matches. We were better at building points and waiting for the right opportunities.”
HARVARD 4, DENVER 3
Harvard wrapped up its second win of the weekend to take the consolation championship. The Crimson quickly moved ahead of the Pioneers by earning the doubles point. The duos of captain Aba Omodele-Lucien-freshman Casey MacMaster and junior Ali Felton-sophomore Andy Nguyen both won their matches
In the singles, the bottom of the lineup was key for Harvard, with the No. 3, No. 5, and No. 6 players each pulling out victories.
Sophomore Josh Tchan earned his second win of the weekend by double bageling his opponent, Angel Alvarez.
“I definitely had a change of strategy against my opponent,” Tchan said. “I think, strategically, I was just playing a lot smarter. I didn’t necessarily overpower him. I just strategically placed my shots well, and then, when the opportunity presented itself to win the point, I took it.”
Omodele-Lucien also toughed out another crucial victory for the Crimson. He rolled through two sets, 6-4, 6-2, against Jens Vorkefeld, for Harvard’s third point of the matchup
MacMaster was the only other player who was able to win for the squad. The victory did not come as easily, but he prevailed, 6-4, in the third set over Alex Clinkenbeard to earn the final point for the Crimson.
HARVARD 6, UAB 1
A day after losing five singles matches in the first round of the tournament, Harvard turned things around to display the same type of dominance over the Blazers.
The Crimson got off to a quick start by winning two of the three doubles matches to earn the first point. Felton and Nguyen cruised through their match, 8-2, over opponents Lucas Dirube and Daniel Moser, while Pearlman and Tchan toughed out an 8-6 victory against Chris Helliar and Danny Manlow.
Harvard continued its command of the matchup in the singles portion of the encounter. Five of the six players won their matches, three doing so in straight sets.
Pearlman won a tight first set, 6-4, against David Zimmerman, but then bageled his opponent in the second. MacMaster won his match in similar form, dropping just six games in two sets.
Playing at the No. 2 position, Felton came out victorious in two tie-break sets, taking the first, 7-3, and the second, 7-5. Nguyen also managed to pull out the victory in tie-break fashion, this time in the third set after he and Tom Puetz split the first two.
ETSU 5, HARVARD 2
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead with the doubles point, but things took a turn for the worse when the squad dropped five of its six singles matches.
In the doubles, the pairs of MacMaster-Omodele-Lucien and Pearlman-Tchan secured the point for Harvard, 8-4 and 8-6, respectively. Felton and Nguyen dropped a close matchup against Jesus Bandres and Sander Gille, 8-6.
Tchan was the lone Crimson player to earn a point for the squad in the singles. His opponent trounced Tchan in the first set, 6-1, but Tchan came back in the second to even the match at one set apiece.
“[After the first set], I saw that everyone was just putting their heart out and I asked myself if I was doing the same thing, and clearly I wasn’t,” Tchan said. “I went into the second set…and just promised myself that I would battle like the rest of my teammates.”
Tchan used the momentum from winning the middle set to battle back and win the third, 10-6.
Felton was the only other Crimson member to snatch a set from his opponent, with four of the six players losing in straights sets.
Felton won the first set in a tie-break, but then lost the next two sets, 6-3 and 6-4.
Omodele-Lucien dropped a tight matchup to Bandres, 7-6, 6-3. At the No. 1 position, Pearlman lost his second straight match, 7-5, 6-2. Nguyen and MacMaster also lost their matches in straights.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard women’s tennis team’s match against the University of San Francisco on Thursday afternoon, junior co-captain Holly Cao found herself in an unfamiliar situation: She was tied with her opponent, junior Julia Wartenburger, after dropping the second set.
No. 67 Cao held an 8-0 singles record at the No. 1 spot coming into the match at Golden Gate Park. The last time Cao split her first two sets was on Feb. 5 against Boston College.
Yet Cao wasn’t fazed, fighting back to win the third set and the match, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1, to maintain her undefeated singles record.
“We all know she’s a fighter,” Crimson coach Traci Green said.
Cao’s victory at No. 1 singles was just one of the highlights of the afternoon, as No. 51 Harvard (5-6) earned a convincing 6-1 victory over the Dons (1-11) during a rainy week in California.
“Given the circumstances, we had a pretty productive spring break,” Cao said. “Everyone adjusted to the weather pretty well.”
The Crimson picked up the No. 2 and No. 3 singles matches in straight sets, as sophomore Hideko Tachibana defeated freshman Cecile Duriez, 6-3, 7-5, and sophomore Kristin Norton defeated sophomore Yurie Hashiguchi, 6-1, 6-2.
Harvard’s only loss of the afternoon came at the No. 4 spot, where junior Samantha Gridley dropped her match to senior Cecilia Gratian, 6-4, 6-0.
But Green was especially proud of freshmen Natalie Blosser and Hannah Morrill, who both prevailed after splitting their first two sets at the No. 5 and No. 6 spots, respectively. The Crimson coach noted how both freshmen were able to find ways to win when their backs were against the wall.
Despite facing junior Alana McMahon, who Green described as “a streaky and fast opponent,” Morrill was able to come away with the win, 6-4, 2-6, 10-7.
Blosser, who was shut-out in the first set, was able to rebound and pull out a victory over senior Jessy Mekpoh, 6-0, 6-4, 10-5.
“Natalie made some adjustments in her game, and she was able to pull off the victory,” Green said.
The Crimson won five of the six singles matches, and it had just as much success in its doubles matches, sweeping all three contests over San Francisco.
Tachibana and Norton played No. 1 doubles, downing Duriez and Hashiguchi, 8-1. Cao and Morrill played together at the No. 2 spot, beating Gratian and Wartenburger, 8-5. Rounding out the doubles matches at the No. 3 spot were co-captain Samantha Rosenkrans and Blosser, who defeated junior Andrea Gaitan and sophomore Melinda Akerbrant, 8-1.
Despite the success of the week, Harvard still had to fight against a few lingering injuries and the rainy weather on the West Coast.
“We were not able to play as much as we wanted to outdoors because of the rain,” Cao said.
In fact, the Crimson had three contests scheduled for its trip to California, but its matches on Tuesday against No. 7 California and on Friday against No. 48 St. Mary’s were both cancelled due to inclement weather.
The match against the Golden Bears would have been a rare opportunity for Harvard to play a highly-ranked opponent.
“That would have been a great match for us and a wonderful building block for the Ivy season,” Green said.
While there was disappointment due to the cancelled matches, the Crimson was able to get in a lot of practice, fitness, and conditioning while it was on the road. Harvard looks forward to returning to the East Coast as it prepares for its next matches at Virginia Commonwealth on March 27 and at Ancient Eight foe Cornell on April 1.
“We’re gaining more and more confidence as we head into the Ivy season,” Green said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After waiting five months, the Harvard golf team will have to wait a little longer for a rematch with Columbia. Originally scheduled for Saturday, the dual match between the Crimson and the Lions was cancelled on account of rain at Meadow Club in Fairfax, Calif.
“We got to the course, and there were just puddles everywhere,” junior Mark Pollak said. “It kept raining all day. There was no way we could play.”
The last time Harvard and Columbia took to the links, the Lions edged the Crimson by nine shots for a victory in The Classic at Shelter Harbor, the fall season finale for both teams.
The tournament, which took place on Oct. 16-17, had been a breakthrough weekend for the Crimson, as the team faced every other Ivy squad and fell only to the Lions, the three-time defending conference champions. Harvard, by contrast, took fifth at last year’s Ivy League  Championship.
Harvard’s next shot at Columbia will come in three weeks at the Princeton Invitational, which will take place at Springdale Golf Club.
The Crimson next takes action at the Yale Spring Opener on April 2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League may have earned a double-digit seed in the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, but the Ancient Eight did better than that in the men’s hockey equivalent.
Yale (27-6-1, 17-4-1 ECAC) earned the No. 1 overall seed after capturing the ECAC title on Saturday, beating Colgate by a resounding 6-0 score.
The Bulldogs had little difficulty closing out the ECAC playoffs, rolling through Colgate twice, St. Lawrence, and the Big Red by a combined score of 19-2.
Despite all of Yale’s postseason successes, the Bulldogs had a tougher time against Harvard (12-21-1, 7-14-1), a team that struggled throughout the early part of the season.
Yale beat the Crimson, 4-2, in their first meeting on Jan. 8, but the second matchup was more competitive. Harvard, which came into the Feb. 4 meeting near the bottom of the ECAC, kept pace with Yale for the first two periods. But a Bulldogs’ goal early in the second frame was enough for Yale to take the 1-0 win.
Harvard was knocked out of the ECAC tournament in the third round, losing to Dartmouth in a decisive third game. The Crimson has not appeared in the NCAA Tournament since 2006 when the team last won the ECAC.
Yale, which takes on Air Force in the tournament’s first round this Friday, is looking to earn a spot in the Frozen Four, being held in St. Paul, Minn. Harvard has not made it to the NCAA semifinals since 1994, but the team appeared four times in the ’80s, winning the national title in 1989.

As senior spring nears an end, many set to graduate at the end of the semester are accepting that the fun of college is coming to a close and choosing a path of consulting or banking. A new tumblr created by Jessica S. Lin '09, a former Crimson editor, W. Hugo Van Vuuren '07, and Mark D. Khanin '12, an inactive Crimson business editor, suggests that, on the contrary, jobs should be found elsewhere.
The tumblr, Apprent.is, aims to provide Harvard and MIT students in the Cambridge area with opportunities to connect with and personally learn from specialists in fields like visual arts and film, rather than business and marketing.
The co-founders believe that at a place like Harvard where students often pursue careers in business, students have less access to creative job opportunities and internships.
"We want to create a connection between students and awesome people in the world," Khanin said. "If you want to follow your passion, this is an awesome way to do that."
Apprent.is is their attempt to do just that, offering career and internship opportunities that are exciting and unconventional post-graduation options.
