After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unless you’re among the one percent of America that is Native American, then immigration policy has fundamentally changed your life (after all, you live here now).  In recent months, immigration has deservedly garnered much attention as President Obama has made it a key second term priority.  Reform legislation, though, is still up in the air.  A proposed bipartisan bill that passed the Senate is currently the subject of intense controversy in the House.  Passions on both sides tend to fixate on the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.  But reform isn’t just about illegal immigration: Although relatively invisible in the public conscience, fixing our broken legal immigration process is just as critical for America’s future.
The current system is embarrassingly slow and complex.  As of last November, more than 4.4 million people, including 1.1 million professionals, were waiting for the green card that provides them permanent residence; some have been waiting for more than twenty years.  Many first came to the U.S. through F-1 student visas.  However, the number of work permit visas that allow these students to work in the U.S. is far lower.  According to the Brookings Institution, 668,513 F-1 student visas were approved in 2010, while a mere 76, 627 H-1B work visas were approved in the same year, only 34.6 percent of which were for F-1 students.  Simply obtaining a work visa may take months or even years due to paperwork.  This means many people educated in America are unable to contribute their skills to the American economy.
Many who do obtain work visas are subsequently unable to obtain green cards.  Much of the problem comes from our rigid immigration rules.  Despite the millions of eligible immigrants in line, only around 120,000 green cards are granted each year, with a strict quota of at most 10,000 green cards from any one country.  This means populous nations such as China, India, and Mexico are allocated the same number of spots as much smaller ones, resulting in massive backlogs of immigrants from the largest countries.  Such a flat quota that doesn’t account for population size or applicant numbers makes little sense.  In fact, the very concept of an artificial quota in general is an antiquated policy that essentially discriminates between immigrants solely based on their national origin, instead of considering what benefits and skills they could offer the U.S.
Because of such inane laws, millions of would-be Americans, people who already live and work in the U.S., are stuck in limbo without a green card.  Those who hold work visas constantly have to renew these temporary permits, and because U.S. residency is tied to their employer, changing jobs can negatively impact immigration status or green card application.  Many return home out of frustration—roughly one in three Indians and one in five Chinese who left the U.S. cited visa issues as a strong factor in their decision.  This trend has been growing in recent years, threatening to create a “reverse brain drain” in which talented, educated individuals leave the country.
Thankfully, the Senate’s immigration bill seeks to significantly expand and streamline the legal process.  It calls for an increase in the number of H-1B work visas for foreign students and professionals.  It would also significantly accelerate the green card process, stipulating that all backlogged applications be resolved within seven years, giving priority to those delayed the longest.  In addition, the bill sensibly ends the by-country quota policy.  Meanwhile, undocumented immigrants in this revised system would be eligible for green cards, but only after meeting certain requirements and going to the “back of the line” behind legal residents.  This is an equitable resolution, providing a tough but constructive answer to a tricky problem without penalizing those who followed the proper immigration procedures.
The long-term economic benefits of reform are clear.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the current proposed bill will increase U.S. GDP by roughly $1.4 trillion in today’s dollars by 2033.  A large part of this boom would be from additional highly educated immigrants who are subsequently able to live and work here.  Some opponents argue that these immigrants will increase unemployment or drain our resources.  However, this objection fails to recognize that the economy is not a zero-sum game.  More than half of engineering and technology companies in Silicon Valley and more than a quarter of those across the nation have foreign-born founders.  Google co-founder Sergey Brin, an immigrant from Russia, is one of many who exemplify this trend.  As a whole, immigrants contribute an estimated $37 billion per year to U.S. GDP.  By utilizing their talents here, they create tremendous value and by extension jobs for the American economy.  If anything, if economics is the primary concern, we should be trying to encourage even more legal immigration.
Of course, for the foreseeable future, the controversy of illegal immigration will continue to dominate headlines and command a lion’s share of public attention.  However, whereas the phenomenon of “illegal” immigration has arisen only in the past few decades, general immigration policy has had an impact on the character and economy of America for centuries.  In the long run, our approach to legal immigration will more likely be what defines our future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like most of his predecessors, President Obama surely keeps a keen eye turned toward his historical legacy. Nearly every modern president since Truman has become associated with a particular doctrine, an articulation of foreign policy attitudes and positions in relation to the international circumstances of the moment. No matter how future journalists and scholars define the Obama doctrine, it has become clear that the current events over Syria will change their analysis of it in an important way.
While the Obama Doctrine has no specific definition yet, it seemed clear up until the past month that it would involve the transition to a “light footprint,” a strategy that minimizes the public visibility of the mechanisms of American influence. Rather than the use of forces on the ground and intensive nation-building efforts, the Obama administration emphasized the use of covert operations, drone strikes, and cyber-warfare as the means to address perceived security threats.
Of course, the light footprint always appeared more of a public relations tactic rather than a significant strategic shift. The priorities of the Obama administration, to the dismay of progressives everywhere, were always more similar to his predecessor than they were different. What changed were the means of combat and the visibility of American force throughout the world. Still, these changes were effective enough to sustain the President’s reelection campaign.
Up until this month, it also seemed clear that the Obama doctrine would incorporate some sort of emphasis on international institutions and a rebuke of the unilateralism that defined the Bush administration. His campaign speeches in 2008 spoke of a need to engage the world and act through international institutions. His later speeches in Egypt and, recently, Germany have affirmed that principle, as did the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya.
To be clear, his first term never rebuked unilateralism out right. In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize, he implicitly defended the ability of the United States to use force under particular circumstances. In fact, the anticipation of multilateralism may have always been something of a liberal pipe dream. Multilateral engagement mostly came through rhetoric. In this way, it also appeared more as a public relations tactic than a significant shift in strategy. While the president has cautiously cultivated this global perception of multilateralism, he has continued to follow the general strategic framework established by his his hawkish predecessor.
The current crisis in Syria, however, threatens to undermine these policies. At the moment, it remains unclear whether the president will be able to maintain the semblance of a light footprint and of multilateral engagement.
In terms of the light footprint, it is true that President Obama has made it clear that he will not deploy soldiers to Syria. Instead, he envisions specific strikes as punitive measures against the Assad regime. Leaving the merits of that particular action aside, these strikes would still represent a shift away from the light footprint as Obama has articulated it.
The light footprint involves significant realpolitik calculations about the nature of particular threats in relation to America’s strategic interest. As Tufts professor Daniel Drezner noted back in June, these calculations would explain the rationale for President Obama’s actions over the past couple of years. The proposed strikes, particularly given their liberal internationalist justifications as a punitive measure against an international norm, represent a significant shift away from the previous strategic calculations about America’s strategic interest and the use of force.
In terms of multilateralism, the current crisis in Syria presents the first explicit instance in which the President might reject multilateral institutions outright by acting directly against the will of the United Nations Security Council and many sovereign states. While the administration’s rhetorical attempts to continue some form of engagement (it appeals to a norm rather than to an actor), the actual decision to use force would still present a reenactment of the unilateralism that defined the Bush administration.
If Congress provides him the authority to act, these strikes will still remove the veneer of international engagement that he has developed throughout his presidency. If Congress does not provide him the authority to act and he chooses to do so anyway, then he would have narrowed the definition of unilateralism from the actions of United States as a nation to those of the executive branch as an actor.
Both the light footprint and multilateral engagement are two ways in which President Obama has attempted to develop a coherent doctrine that allows the United States to continue the use of force in a particular manner while appearing more genial and beneficial to the world. He has cultivated this image strategically and cautiously. The current debate over Syria has produced a variety of strategic casualties by the administration; Obama’s foreign policy legacy may just be another one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Approximately 25 percent of college women have survived rape or attempted rape in their lifetime. Some of those women go to Harvard.
From 2011 to 2012, the number of rapes on Harvard’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses reported confidentially rose from 12 to 23, according to the Harvard University Police Department’s annual campus security report. Though the spike in numbers may be attributable partly to an increase in reporting, the change certainly does not indicate a declining incidence of rape.
This upward trend underscores the need for Harvard to respond appropriately and effectively to student rape reports. Rape, by virtue of the social stigma associated with it and psychological trauma resultant from it, is often handled outside of the criminal justice system. As we have said before, Harvard ought to ensure that effective mechanisms exist on campus to provide victims who seek on-campus disciplinary action with fair treatment. But the University also must support rape survivors in filing official reports with the police.
A rape victim has the opportunity to report his or her assault confidentially—without revealing the victim’s name, address, and additional identifying information to the police—because rape and other forms of indecent assault differ in nature from garden variety crime. Victims of sexual assault may fear retaliation by the crime’s perpetrator or re-victimization during the criminal justice process, whether that means living the experience over while recounting details or facing police doubts. In fact, over half of rape victims nationwide do not report the assault. 16 percent say they fear reprisal, and 6 percent point to perceived police bias.
For these reasons, Harvard chooses—and chooses wisely—not to force students who have been assaulted to file official reports with the police. All the same, perpetrators of rape often do not face the punishment they may deserve when victims do not take their cases to the police. Even when assaulted students authorize on-campus investigations, rapists rarely face severe punishment: From 2005 to 2010, not a single case of sexual misconduct that went before the Harvard College Administrative Board ended in permanent expulsion, though Harvard has since begun reexamining its policies regarding sexual assault and Ad Board deliberation.
Insofar as it can do so sensitively, Harvard should encourage victims to move forward with their cases and press criminal charges. The University could accomplish this by explaining the criminal investigation process in depth to survivors, reassuring them—among other things—that in 95 percent of cases the prosecution and defense reach a plea agreement that spares the victim the ordeal of testifying in court. Harvard must also stress and strengthen the systems it has in place that guarantee a survivor’s safety on campus in the midst of an investigation.
Slowly and steadily, Harvard has been taking steps to revise its response to rape on campus. But as always, more work remains to be done, and this year’s HUPD report is an indication of just that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I thought about writing a postcard this summer. But it seemed wrong to send one from my home.
Postcards carry greetings to home from faraway lands. Covered margin to margin in the writer’s hurried hand, they convey tales of the unfamiliar to the very familiar—parents, siblings, friends, that guy you’re kind of seeing.
To me, the District of Columbia is filled with the familiar. Or at least it used to be. Spending this summer there, I wondered if it might now be filled only with memories.
When I first came home over Thanksgiving break, I felt lost, in limbo between my new life behind Johnston Gate and my old one inside the Beltway.  I went to sit on my living room couch, a piece of furniture on which I’d spent enough nights poring over 19th-century floor speeches (for history) and vectors in n-space (for math) to have created what I thought was an indelible, Molly-shaped dent in the cushion. But the imprint had faded, at least as far as I could make out underneath the papers my little brother had strewn across my former home-within-a-home.
“Yeah, I sit there now,” announced the 15-year-old intruder smugly.
“This is my couch,” I replied, my tone marked with far too much emotion to befit the situation.
“Molly,” my father said in the voice he reserves to explain things to the very young or very stupid. “He lives here.”
Naturally, I burst into tears.
It was only a few days later that I accidentally referred to returning to campus as “going home”… and cried again. My Freudian slip and subsequent mini-meltdown forced me to do something I should probably do more often: think. This summer, the phenomenon repeated itself.
I was living in my house, sleeping in my bed, and, yes, sitting on my couch. But in the morning, instead of donning jeans and a t-shirt and driving off to school, I put on my grown-up clothes and blended in seamlessly—or so I liked to think—with the weary commuters who travel down the Red Line weekday after weekday. And in the evening, instead of staying up late ostensibly completing last-minute homework, but mostly watching Seinfeld, I shared tales from the office with my parents before collapsing (sometimes still in those aforementioned grown-up clothes) in a tired heap and drifting off to sleep.
I was living in my house, but was I really living at home?
It took 11 hours, 650 miles, and one snail making its slow, sticky way up a rocky beach in Belfast, Maine—my final summer destination—to convince me of the answer: yes.
A snail takes its home with it. Shell planted firmly on its (lack of) shoulders, the creature I spotted was at home when it crawled out of the ocean. It was at home when I saw it dragging itself over the high tide line. It would remain at home whether it turned back toward the sea or found a cool, comfortable tide pool to rest in on the shore. And no matter if that home gets roughed up along the way—bruised by a barnacle, slimed by the seaweed, stained by the sun—it will still be home.
So really, I was home this summer, I was at home in Maine, and now I’m at home once again on the banks of the Charles (or, more realistically, a little ways up Garden Street). Each home is a little different because, each time I relocate, I am a little different. Home moves when I do, accreting with every place I go, every job I work, and every person I meet.
The same is true of every Harvard student, though it might not always feel that way—especially not at first. Within Harvard, undergraduates find themselves caught in a culture of transience. We move quickly and constantly, from class to class in the mornings, from dining hall to dining hall in the afternoons and evenings, from final club to final club at night (if you’re into that sort of thing).
But in each new spot, we pick up something lasting. We realize the wonders of Gilbert’s electrifying psychology lectures, the horrors of HUDS red-spiced chicken, and the somewhere-in-between of a Thursday throw-down at the Delphic. These small things become part of our own shells. And one fine morning, we wake up knowing what’s been true all along: We’re at home, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, till even after graduation do us part.
Of course, that doesn’t mean I’m ever going to give up my couch.

UPDATED: September 9, 2013, at 6:56 p.m.
A man was stabbed near the intersection of Memorial Drive and John F. Kennedy Street at about 9 p.m. Sunday night, police said shortly after the crime occurred.
In an email to The Crimson, Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello also confirmed that the crime had occurred.
Early media reports said that the crime had taken place in John F. Kennedy Park, but a statement released by state police Monday morning said that it had occurred on Memorial Drive.
State police found the victim “conscious and alert,” after which the victim was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, according to WCVB.com.
The Boston Globe reported late Sunday night that the victum was stabbed multiple times.
It was not possible to confirm whether the victim or the aggressor have any University affiliation.
Riviello wrote in an emailed statement that while the CPD initially responded to a report of stabbing, the investigation was later determined to be the responsibility of the state police, since the crime occurred on state property.
Five state police vehicles were present at the crime scene at 10 p.m. Sunday night. The corner of the intersection across from the University’s Weld Boathouse was cordoned off and attended by a state police officer.
Several passersby gathered around the cordoned-off area inquiring about the night’s happening, but the state police officer in attendance declined to comment.
Reports of assault in the Cambridge area are not unknown. Last year, 28 cases of aggravated assault were reported in the area surrounding Harvard’s Cambridge campus, according to statistics disclosed in the Harvard University Police Department’s annual crime report. That number represents a drop from the 36 aggravated assaults reported in 2011.

The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology subpoenaed data last month from a Harvard School of Public Health study that has been used to justify nearly two decades of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on air pollution.
The researchers who authored the 1993 study—Douglas W. Dockery of HSPH and C. Arden Pope III of Brigham Young University—have refused to disclose the data, asserting concerns about the privacy of the study’s 8,000 subjects and citing a history of scientific analyses that have produced similar findings. But the Committee may eventually demand that Harvard release the information.
The government-funded, peer-reviewed study, which concluded that air pollution “contributes to excess mortality in certain U.S. cities,” has been a target of politicians opposed to pollution restrictions. According to the Boston Globe, the subpoena is the first filed by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee in 21 years and was approved on a party-line vote, with all Republican committee members voting in its favor.
The HSPH study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, additionally addresses a 1995 American Cancer Society study, also authored by Pope, that ties air pollution to a higher rate of emergency room visits.
A Committee aide said in an emailed statement that data the EPA uses to support its regulations should be subject to review by Congress. The aide also stressed that the Committee has promised to keep the data private and work with the EPA to ensure that subjects remain anonymous.
The EPA missed the subpoena’s August 19 deadline to disclose the study’s data. Committee chairman and Texas Republican Representative Lamar Smith told the Globe that he will pursue further action if the EPA does not comply by the end of September, which could include a subpoena issued to Harvard.
Dockery, now the chair of the Department of Environmental Health at HSPH, said in an email that while he and his colleagues are generally in favor of open access, they are wary of releasing any information that could identify individuals.
“Public release of the personal data of people who have volunteered to participate in these studies is unethical and would undermine all future research involving human subjects,” Dockery wrote.
Pope, who was at Harvard when the study was published, agreed, noting that the release of private data violates both confidentiality agreements with research participants and mandates from institutional review boards.
The study’s findings, Pope said in an email to The Crimson, have also been “reproduced, replicated, extended, and documented in multiple peer-reviewed publications” in the two decades since it was published.
Pope additionally stated that data from the study has been made available for independent data audits. A 1997 review by the EPA-funded nonprofit Health Effects Institute, which was allowed use of the data after the Institute pledged to keep it private, validated the results of the study.
Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey, who lobbies members of congress on behalf of Harvard, said in an email that the University has complied with every request for the study’s data that it has received from the EPA.
“Unfortunately, due to the ease with which one could potentially identify participants by linking the personal health information we have collected with death records, this is not a simple matter,” Casey added.
Science and Technology Committee Republicans have said that they want to ensure the study’s validity, but others claim that the subpoena was filed for other reasons.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Robert N. Stavins, an environmental economist, said that the subpoena was “driven by ideology more than science” and serves as “just another manifestation of the highly polarized political climate” that now surrounds environmental policy.
“More information about the science is not going to change anyone’s minds,” Stavins said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As you may have noticed, there is no separate sports section this Monday, as there has been for years. Many of the stories that would have been in that section appear in today's flagship daily paper, but some do not.
We have decided to eliminate the weekly sports section in favor of focusing on online content to continue providing the Harvard community top-notch sports news in as timely a manner as possible. We hope this shift will allow The Crimson to play as large a role on campus 140 years from now as it has in its first 140 years.
When The Crimson created a weekly sports section, the goal was to produce the go-to source for Harvard sports news each Monday. Today’s world is very different from the one that saw the creation of the Monday section. Box scores from almost any intercollegiate competition are accessable at a whim, often immediately after the contest concludes.
You can now expect to see full stories with pictures and other multimedia content online the same day as the game takes place. Many times, that content will go online throughout the game, before the final buzzer sounds or the field clears.
Our time and energy will now be shifted away from creating the print product and instead toward larger-scale projects to ensure that the biggest stories in Harvard sports receive the attention, in print and online, that they deserve.
All of that said, the printed paper will still play a large role in our mission going forward. Each Monday, we will provide stories from the most recent, important, and exciting weekend games. We will also continue to print a page in the other four days a week.
The decision to eliminate the sports section was not made lightly, but we felt it was a necessary one. The weekly creation of an exclusively print product  has become a misallocation of resources for this organization in this time. A shift in our focus allows The Crimson to continue to serve as  your go-to source for Harvard sports news.

Travelling cross country to compete in the University of San Fransisco tournament, the Harvard women’s soccer team faced No. 19/20 California in the opening round. In its first game of the season, the Crimson fell short against the Golden Bears, losing 2-1.
California, who had already played four games this season, struck early against Harvard when Ifeoma Onumonu buried a ball from the top of the box in the third minute.
“We probably were on our heels a little bit,” senior Elizabeth Weisman said. “The first five minutes of the game is a big moment of the game.”
Harvard however, was able to come back and be aggressive, out-shooting California, 12-10.
Although the Crimson put shots on net, California struck next. In the 68th minute, the Golden Bears’ Celeste Boureille finished off a cross from Kaitlyn Fitzpatrick.
The two-goal lead would prove insurmountable for the Crimson.
“I felt like we had possession of the game for most of it, but they had the counter-attack on some plays,” Weisman said.
The possession time finally paid off with Crimson sophomore Lauren Varela coming off the bench to get Harvard on the scoreboard for the first time of the season, finishing off a rebound for a goal.
It was her fourth career goal. It was not enough though, as Harvard was only able to place one more shot on net the rest of the game.
Junior goalie Kanten Bethany had five saves on seven shots on goal for an 83 percent save percentage.
Although Harvard didn’t win, the young team was proud of its performance against a ranked opponent, especially one of such size.
California, a school of over 25,000 undergraduates, is nearly four times the size of Harvard.
“I think a lot of times we and other people see Harvard in a different kind of light as other big schools and we need to consider ourselves like them,” Weisman said. “I think we come out a little bit timid.”
The size discrepancy mattered less to others, including coach Ray Leone, who believed the major difference was the Crimson’s later starting date to the season, which led to less practice time for Harvard.
“The only difference right now is that they’ve been training longer than us, so it took more time to get acclimated to the speed of play,” Leone said.
The lack of any previous games provided Harvard no time to find itself.
“We just want to use the first four or five games to get game fit, to work on our system, and maximize our potential.”
Many freshman earned their first starts Friday.
Midge Purce and Bailey Gary started in their first game in Crimson uniforms and Karly Zlatic came out hot, putting a shot on net a mere 13 seconds into the contest.
“They brought tenacity to the game,” Leone said. “There are plenty of 21 and 22-year-olds in a college game and they will get used to that as they play more.”
The freshmen replace the six seniors lost to graduation last year. All of those seniors started at least a game last season.
“Overall all our freshman have done an amazing job.” Leone said. “I think that we really stepped up to the plate with it being our first official game. We really showed we could keep up with a team like that.”
The Crimson continued its season in the University of San Francisco tournament Sunday, facing the host team. It lost, 2-1. The team has nearly a month to work out kinks and acclimate its freshman before it faces Penn in the Ivy League opener Sept. 27.
Certainly not discouraged, the team believes its first game showed it could succeed later in the season. Two years removed from its last NCAA tournament berth, many current players know where talent combined with chemistry can take a team. Coming off a .500 season, this year’s team is excited, even coming off a loss.
“The potential is good, we are pleased with where we are at this stage,” said Coach Leone. “We have the talent to compete with anyone in the league.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 3-13 campaign last year, the Harvard field hockey team dropped its first two games of this season under second-year coach Tjerk van Herwaarden.
The Crimson lost its season opener Friday night at Richard F. Garber Field in Amherst, Mass., against No. 14 Massachusetts before falling to Bryant on Sunday in its home opener.
BRYANT 2, HARVARD 1.
After an opening game loss to Massachusetts, Harvard (0-2) scored early against Bryant (3-1) as it looked for its first win of the season.  But, the team was unable to hold on, losing 2-1 in a game that came down to the last play.
Less than three minutes into the game, freshman Marisa Balleza had a shot ricochet off the post, allowing fellow freshman Sarah Finnemore to rebound the shot for her first collegiate goal.
“It was pretty exciting,” Finnemore said. “Actually four of the players on Bryant, including the goalie, were on my team in high school so that was a fun way to score my first goal.”
But Bryant chipped away at the Crimson’s lead, scoring off a penalty corner in the 27th minute.
Harvard’s defense was able to limit Bryants’ opportunities inside the scoring area, holding Bryant to eight shots but in the 54th minute the Bulldogs scored again off a penalty corner.
The Crimson continued to get opportunities until the end of the game, culminating with a penalty corner as time expired. Harvard got one free play, until the ball left the scoring area, but was unable to convert.
Play ended on a controversial kicking penalty call, where it appeared the goalie kick-saved the ball, but Harvard was called for the penalty.
“The official didn’t think [it happened that way], so you win some and you lose some,” Herwaarden said. “It was an unfortunate game. We got fifteen shots on goal, which is high for us since we are not an offensive powerhouse.”
MASSACHUSETTS 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard started its season Friday night against No. 14 Massachusetts (4-0). The Crimson did not register a shot until the 37th minute of the game and failed to record a shot on goal all night in a 3-0 loss to the Minutewomen.
The UMass offense took 12 shots and received nine corners in the first half.  Though senior goalie Jenn Hatfield had six saves in the first stanza, it was not enough to keep the Minutewomen off the board as Massachusetts scored twice off of corners in the span of six minutes.
Junior back Lauren Allymohamed started the scoring for the Minutewomen in the 25th minute off an assist from freshman midfielder Charlotte Vereist.  In the 31st minute, sophomore midfielder Brooke Sabia made the score 2-0 in favor of Massachusetts.
“Playing a tough opponent early on really exposes your weaknesses and shows you what you need to work on,” junior forward Noel Painter said. “We came in with the mentality of trying to upset them and start off the season strong, and though it didn’t work out we saw a lot of stuff in the game film that we can work on moving forward.”
Harvard came out stronger in the second half and immediately received back-to-back shots from Balleza and junior forward Kaitlyn Boudah.
The increased presence of the Crimson’s attack would have no effect in the outcome of the game however, and the Minutewomen put the game away in the 69th minute with a goal from freshman forward Izzie Delario.
Harvard’s offense finished the night with only four shots, and two of those occurred in the final 10 minutes with the game out of reach. Balleza led the Crimson with two shots in her first collegiate action.
Harvard’s defense allowed Massachusetts 20 shots, but Hatfield came up big time after time on her way to nine saves on the night in only the third start of her career.
“Jenn Hatfield really stepped up in the goal,” sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson said. “She had to face a lot of corners and she made some huge stops.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson (1-4, 0-0 Ivy) rounded out the weekend splitting its matches on Sunday in its games against Washington & Jefferson and No. 9 UC Irvine. Harvard won its first game of the season against W&J, 17-10, but then fell to the UC Irvine Anteaters to finish out the weekend with a 1-4 record.
“We’re incorporating a lot of young freshman talent,” sophomore Chris Miao said. “So this weekend was all about building our team and building our chemistry. I know we made good strides this weekend, but it was just one step, and you have to keep climbing the stairs.”
UC IRVINE 18, HARVARD 9
In its final game of the weekend, Harvard lost to the Anteaters to finish 1-4 at the Bruno Fall Classic. The Crimson fell behind 4-0 in the first quarter and trailed for the rest of the competition.
Robbie Fluegge led the Crimson offense with three goals, while sophomore Noah Harrison and classmate Blake Lee contributed two apiece. Harrison also had four assists and two steals. Jimmy Woolway anchored the defense with seven saves in goal.
UCI was the third top-ten ranked team that Harvard faced in its matches over the weekend.
“The whole point of having us play five games in two days was so we could build chemistry, get that conditioning in, and for us to really get to know each other before we go and play these tournaments,” freshman Dan Stevens said. “That’s why we play teams like UC Irvine; so that we can understand our limits, how we can push ourselves.”
HARVARD 17, WASHINGTON & JEFFERSON 10
Harvard netted four goals in the first quarter against the Washington & Jefferson Presidents and kept the lead going for the entire game.
Six different Crimson players contributed to the goal total, with Harrison leading the pack with four.
“Noah really contributed both days,” Stevens said. “He had some mental slips, but he really came back. He’s been working his tail off, even before preseason, and you can tell that he works really hard every day.”
Freshman Viktor Wrobel and junior Max Murphy both contributed three goals apiece, and Lee led the team with four assists.
Harvard led 9-3 at halftime and scored five more goals to hold a commanding 14-5 lead going into the final quarter. The Crimson were outscored 5-3 in fourth frame but held on for its first win.
No. 16 BROWN 9, HARVARD 8
In the nightcap Saturday, Brown staged a come-from-behind victory, denying the Crimson a shot at their first victory of the season with a fourth period comeback. Harvard was in control for much of the contest, and entered the fourth holding a 6-3 lead. After the Crimson extended the lead to 7-4, the Bears began their rally. Sophomore Matty Gallas notched the tying goal for Brown, and freshman Warren Smith scored the eventual game-winner. Senior goalie Walker Shockley, who had 11 saves, kept Harvard’s offense at bay, and the Bears’ 12 steals helped him do so.
No. 3 STANFORD 17, HARVARD 5
Earlier, the Crimson took on the Cardinal, which finished the 2012 season ranked fourth nationally. Harvard trailed just 6-3 at halftime, but Stanford then posted seven goals in the third, and added four more in the fourth for the win. The Crimson had just two scores in the second half. Senior Jimmy Field was in goal for Harvard and had 11 saves, and Lee assisted on each of the Crimson’s five goals.
No. 10 ST. FRANCIS 10, HARVARD 7
In Harvard’s season-opening match, it took on the Terriers, which finished third at last year’s NCAA Championships. St. Francis’ freshmen were too much for the Crimson, as Ilija Djuretic posted two scores to go with seven steals while his classmate Lazar Komadinic tallied four goals. Still, the match remained tight, as Harvard trailed 4-3 at the half and 5-4 heading into the fourth period. The Crimson tied the score at seven, but the Terriers pulled away down the stretch. St. Francis held Harvard scoreless during the final two minutes of the game. Harrison had four goals for the Crimson, and Woolway had 11 saves.

It's 1 a.m. and you're trying to sleep, but the kids next door are being loud and rambunctious. You can't tell them to quiet down, because you want to look fun-loving, but you also cannot put up with it, because you are, in fact, not fun-loving. So here are some tips to help you deal with the noise in an effective manner that will not ruin your reputation as someone who enjoys deafening noises and doesn't need to sleep—because somehow vampires and insomniacs are still trendy.
1. Play Your Own Music
If your hallmates have bad taste in music and you find yourself listening to a bad combination of Avril Lavigne and the frat basement (believe it or not, there are good combinations) you may have to respond in kind. Move your speakers directly against the wall and blast your own music so that your neighbors get a taste of their own medicine. Personally, I like will.i.am's "Big and Chunky" from "Madagascar 2," but any song that at one time featured a large singing herbivore should do. Bonus points if it's a hippo.
2. Become Anonymous
Especially if you have been playing music from DreamWorks movies, you probably don't want to be associated with your room. So stop using your front door and remove any incriminating information from it. Replace your name and hometown with a picture of a criminal or thug. No one will dare bother you if you have a picture of Al Capone or Swiper on your door.
3. Invite Yourself
If your hallmates have already met you or if you can't find a flattering picture of Jack Sparrow, then try this amicable approach: Threaten to crash any future party. If your reputation is anything like mine, trust me, they will never throw a party again.
4. File a Complaint
Write an in-depth letter to your neighbor and outline all of your complaints in a comprehensive yet respectful fashion. This is a clear and effective way to communicate your thoughts. Then tear it up or burn it. Wasting paper always makes me feel better about things.

So the course of your dreams—convenient time slot, knocks out a Gen Ed, cross-counts for concentration credit—has been lotteried, and the professor writes to you: "Looking forward to a great semester of this class—except without you in it." No need to panic just yet, though. On this Study Card Day Eve, Flyby's got you covered. 
You didn't get: CS 105: "Privacy and Technology"
Guess Waldo didn't think your video application was ready for prime time. 
You should take: GOV 1430: "The Politics of Personal Data." Meets Tuesday/Thursday 10:00-11:30 in CGIS-Knafel K-107. Same general topics as "Privacy and Technology," and a "data lab component" that may make this even more of a CS class than 105. 
You didn't get: GOV 1510: "American Constitutional Law"
We scoured the entire internet for traces of its near twin, Laurence Tribe's United States in the World 18: "Thinking About the Constitution"—but unfortunately, that course seems to have vanished completely. 
You should take: ER 31: "The Philosopher and the Tyrant." But only if you need an ethical reasoning class that meets at roughly the same time (Tuesday/Thursday 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Sever Hall 203). We know it's not the same. 
You didn't get: USW 30: "Tangible Things: Harvard Collections in World History"
If you can wait, you should take: Anthro 1130: "Archaeology of Harvard Yard," offered next fall. 
If you can't wait, and you're looking for a U.S. in the World, take: USW 13: "Medicine and Society in America" It meets at the same time (Monday/Wednesday 11 a.m. in Yenching Auditorium).
 
You didn't get: SPU 27: "Science and Cooking"
If you're just looking for the SPU requirement, you should take: PHYSICS 15c: "Wave Phenomena," which meets at the same time just one room over in Science Center D. But somehow, that doesn't strike us as too natural of a replacement. 
If you just want to be able to snarkily respond that you're "studying" whenever you're stress-eating, take: 
Anthro 1040: "Origins of the Food We Eat." Meets Monday/Wednesday at 11 a.m. in Peabody Museum Putnam Lab (59-D) or
EMR 22: "Nutrition and Health: Myths, Paradigms, and Science." Meets Monday 2 p.m. - 4 p.m. in Harvard Hall 104.
 
You didn't get: GOV 1540: "The American Presidency"
You should take: GOV 30: "American Government: A New Perspective." Meets Monday/Wednesday 1 p.m. in CGIS-South S-010 Lecture Hall or
GOV 1060: "Ancient and Medieval Political Philosophy" — a great way to sneak an ER in! Meets Tuesday/Thursday 11:30 p.m. - 1 p.m. in CGIS-Knafel K-050.
 
You didn't get: HIST-LIT 90at: "The Postwar American Road Narrative;" HIST-LIT 90au: Zombies, Monsters, and Super Heroes: The Fantastic in 20th-c. America;" or another small English, History, or Hist and Lit seminar
You should take: HIST-LIT 90aj: "America Through European Eyes" Meets Tuesday 2 p.m. - 4 p.m. in Barker 118. or
HIST-LIT 90ax: "Africans in Europe." Meets Thursdays 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. Barker 118. or
HIST-LIT 90aw: "Life Narratives in Postcolonial Africa." Meets Monday 3 p.m. - 5 p.m. in Barker 118. 
 
You didn't get: USW 36: "Innovation and Entrepreneurship: American Experience in Comparative Perspective"
You should take: We looked really hard for something similar that you wouldn't have to cross the river to take but couldn't find one. Harvard, this is a pretty popular topic—what's going on? 
 
You didn't get: Folklore and Myth 128: "Fairy Tale, Myth, and Fantasy Literature"
Huh: We looked pretty hard but somehow couldn't find another class that has Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows on the syllabus. We could look for other classes in this time slot that meet Folk and Myth requirements, if any of its handful of concentrators would find that helpful?
Amidst the flurry that is the college application process, it’s hard to keep up with what’s going on in the news, and even to keep up with the constant stream of information that should help you find the right school for you.
Well now, The Admissions Blog is here to keep you informed and sate your curiosity with the first installment of our weekly news series. Check back each Friday in order to stay abreast of scandal, drama, and shenanigans (or, you know, policy changes) of college admissions.
BY THE NUMBERS. Do you want to know how many Harvard freshman are virgins? Do you want to know how rich their parents are? For all those prospective students out there curious about what the Harvard College Class of 2017 is really like, The Crimson has recently  released a four part survey of the new Harvard freshman class. This  survey, taken by nearly 80 percent of the class, covers a wide range of topics  in and out of the classroom. Income and cheating and drug use, oh my!
THE PERFECT APPLICATION. It seems like this book about a private (and very well paid) college admissions counselor would make a wonderfully bad reality TV show.
TESTING TALK. This time, high school juniors aren't the only ones fighting against standardized testing. The president of Ithaca College wrote against the practice and highlighted what he and other college administrators are doing to drive the SATs to extinction.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. This past June, the Supreme Court ruled on a case that had the potential to end consideration of race in college admissions. The court mostly avoided the issue, sending the decision back to a lower court and leaving affirmative action as it was. Though affirmative action has not been struck down at a national level, voters in some states have placed state-wide bans, meaning that in Arizona, California, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Washington State, colleges and universities cannot consider race in admissions decisions. But this year, the Supreme Court will hear a case about the constitutionality of Michigan's law banning affirmative action, and the result could potentially strike down both Michigan's law and similar laws in other states.
RANKINGS. As the world waits with bated breath for the famous (or infamous) US News & World Report’s annual ranking of colleges and universities, US News has announced that there will be a shift in their methodology. Plot twist!
WORDS FROM THE WISE? US News rounded up some well-meaning college students to give advice for the application process. Read only if you want to feel bad about your lack of motivation.
 
College visits can be daunting. You’re thrown into a place for just a few hours and forced to decide if you'd like to spend four years of your life there. Everyone else on your tour is your “competition,” and they all look so much older, wiser, cooler and less stressed out. But visiting doesn’t have to be stressful, and it can also be one of the most helpful tools for picking out where you want to go. Here we have a “to do” list to aid you in making the most of every visit.
1. Start early and make a list of all the colleges you want to visit. Plan to visit colleges near each other in the same day or weekend to minimize the amount of time you’re stuck travelling.
2. This one seems like a no brainer, but always check when and where tours and information sessions are. Sometimes the information changes, so double check the day before your visit.
3. Many schools offer both information sessions and campus tours, and some require pre-registration—make sure you register if necessary.
4. Don’t be afraid to ask questions—this is a big decision you’re making, and you need to be well informed.
5. Look up classes you’d want to check out, especially large lecture ones where you won’t feel awkward walking in. It could also be beneficial to email professors beforehand not only to make your presence is acceptable, but also to put you in touch with someone at the school who is an expert in something you’re interested in.
6. This might be the only time you get to talk face-to-face with a student at the school, so make sure to ask things that admissions officers wouldn’t be able to answer—inquire about dorm life, dining halls, social events, etc.
7. If the school allows it, schedule an on-campus interview, even if you have had another interview. It doesn’t hurt to have more people speak about how amazing you are to admissions committees.
8. Go on specialized tours of things you’re interested in. Sometimes schools offer engineering tours, arts tours or other categories that highlight what facilities and programs are especially good at the institution.
9. Make sure to leave time to wander around. Try to get a feel for not only the campus but also the surrounding area. Are there cool shops nearby, good date spots, convenience stores in case you run out of shampoo? Ask your tour guide where students like to hang out and ask for lunch recommendations.
10. Stay with a student overnight, especially if you’re a senior. This will really give you a feel for what it is actually like to go there.
11. Eat a meal at a dining hall. If you’re going to spend a few years somewhere, hopefully you’ll like the food. Or at the very least, know how many instant noodles and canned soups to stockpile in case you go.
12. Consider what students are wearing, what events are happening on campus and other aspects of student life. It will help you understand what it is like to live there in addition to just taking classes. Don’t underestimate the vibe of a campus; if you feel uneasy and overly nervous, then chances are that school isn’t the right fit for you.

Dear Reader,
They say knowledge is power, and that’s especially true in the college admissions process. But when that knowledge is for sale, the system breaks down. Those who can afford it spend thousands of dollars to obtain this information from private college counselors, and those who can't spend hours on websites like College Confidential, browsing through hundreds of posts from uninformed users to help them make a crucial life decision.
Our goal is to fix this problem.
This is The Harvard Crimson Admissions Blog. We'll use this space to write about colleges and the college admissions process, probing everything from athletic recruiting to standardized testing. We’ll be focusing on the most selective American colleges and universities, about which there exists a great deal of misinformation and speculation, but we won’t limit ourselves to these schools. We’ll also examine other private and public institutions, community colleges, online education models, and alternative post-high school options.
With this blog, The Crimson seeks to disseminate useful, unbiased, and accurate information about what, for some, will be the most important—and the most expensive—years of their lives.
We’ll strive to provide you the information you need by answering the questions everyone encounters in the college admissions process—how to study for the SATs, what to wear to an interview, and when to visit college campuses.
We’ll seek to be objective in how we investigate and how we write. We’ll conduct quantitative analyses of academic rigor and qualitative assessments of social life on campuses.
And, above all, we’ll make it our mission to deliver the truth. We’ll take a critical eye to the information that colleges put in glossy pamphlets—because there’s much more to a school than smiling students sitting beneath a tree in a grassy quad.
We'll investigate the rumors spread, not just through word of mouth and the internet, but also by college admissions offices around the country. If a school has an optional essay—that it promises is 100 percent optional!—should you write it? Some schools say that you don't increase your chances of being accepted if you apply early. Should you believe them? When an admissions officer says that you should "just be yourself" in your interview, does that mean you should talk at length about your obsession with trashy fan fiction?
This blog is run by Harvard College students on the staff of The Harvard Crimson, and at The Crimson we take pride in the fact that we are financially and editorially independent from our university. Because of this, we can promise our readers fair coverage of Harvard and other institutions of higher education. The Crimson has a 140-year history of reporting accurately and objectively, and a staff of 400 writers and editors who deliver that information every day.
Navigating the college admissions process can be tricky. And while we can’t provide you with a formula to get into Harvard or any other school, we can deliver the facts you need to make the most informed decisions possible.
