After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In fencing, it’s rare to have a perfect performance and even rarer to have that perfect performance at the first match of the year.
But that is what the women’s fencing team did its home and season opener. The Crimson (1-0) routed Wellesley (7-7) by a 27-0 score at the Malkin Athletic Center on Thursday evening. Harvard’s foil, sabre, and epee weapons all posted perfect 9-0 bout records in an impressive start to the season.
This was the second competition and first team matchup for the Crimson, which sent fencers to compete in the Penn State Open individually in November.
“On a team your result counts for the team result and not just your own,” sophomore foil fencer Hellary Zhang said. “And I personally think it’s a lot more fun that way. It is a lot more pressure, but at the end of the day you are fencing for something that is bigger than yourself, and that’s always really exciting.”
For the five new freshman on the Harvard team this was their first collegiate team matchup, but they held themselves like veterans en route to holding the Blue to zero match wins on the day.
“I’m really proud of how the team did today finishing 27-0,” junior foil fencer Liana Yamin said. “To be able to do that every bout even when more and more pressure adds on as you’re getting closer to the goal of 27 really shows how well we came together and supported each other.”
This team win builds upon strong individual performances at the Penn State Open, where six fencers finished in the top 10. The Crimson dominated the sabre division at that event, with senior Aliya Itzkowitz, junior Adrienne Jarocki, and freshman Gabby Tartakovsky placing first, second, and sixth, respectively.
This dominance continued as the same team of Itzkowitz, Jarocki, and Tartakovsky allowed just 11 touches to their Wellesley opponents. Foil fencers Yamin, Zhang, and junior Hali Nelson were close behind, giving up only 13 touches as a trio. The epee team of freshman Shawn Wallace, sophomore Claire Dinhut, and freshman Sharon Ra helped to round out the perfect 27, not dropping one bout either.
The last time Harvard defeated its opponent by a margin as large as in Thursday’s matchup was December 2010 against North Carolina. The group also had never opened a season with such a lopsided score.
The Crimson entered the match with no recent experience playing the Wellesley team. Harvard had not hosted Wellesley since 2000, in which the Crimson came out on top by a 23-4 margin. Harvard now leads the series overall, 20-5, and 11-1 at home.
Although Harvard does not usually play Wellesley in its opener, it does keep it local. The past two seasons were kicked off with victories against Tufts, 22-5 and 25-2, respectively. These strong performances then translated into a sweep of five wins at the Tradition Tournament hosted by Sacred Heart.
“We’ve been training really hard in the preseason,” Yamin said. “And it’ll be good to go into Sacred Heart with this confidence that we got from today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SCHENECTADY, N.Y.—After scoring the game’s first two goals and appearing comfortably in control, the No. 8/8 Harvard men’s hockey team (6-1-2, 4-1-2 ECAC) struggled to a tie here on Friday night against conference foe Union (4-6-4, 1-5-1), mounting two third-period comebacks to earn a 4-4 draw.
“That’s a good hockey team. Teams like [Boston University] and Michigan have come in here and had their hands full, so we knew it was going to be a battle,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 after the game, which Union led twice in the third until the Crimson’s Wiley Sherman equalized the contest with 2:29 remaining. “I thought our guys stayed with it. I thought we had a very good third and overtime, and we were pressing there. There’s some things we can certainly do better, but the effort was there.”
Hitting the road for the second consecutive weekend, Harvard got off to a fast start in front of a near-capacity crowd at Messa Rink when co-captain Jimmy Vesey quieted the fans with a goal just 10 seconds into the first period. The strike, Vesey’s eighth of the season, came after a Union defensive zone turnover gave Harvard co-captain Kyle Criscuolo the puck in the slot.
“I knew their [defensemen] was going to be coming back thinking I was going to shoot, so I heard Jimmy calling for it back door, and when you have a goal scorer like him, you’re going to give it to him,” Criscuolo said.
Criscuolo them tacked on another goal for the Crimson, helping Harvard to take a 2-0 lead 17:22 into the game.
The momentum shifted quickly, however, after Dutchmen winger Spencer Foo dampened the Crimson’s energy with an unassisted strike with 15 seconds remaining in the first period. The tally brought the crowd to its feet and killed Harvard’s two-goal buzz.
“Can’t give up a goal in the last minute of the first period, so that was pretty tough for us going into the locker room,” Criscuolo said.
“We had several chances to extend it, and then we give up a goal—I know the shots were pretty close, but I didn’t feel like the play was close or the chances were close,” Donato said.
The Dutchmen took the energy and ran with it, tying the game in the second when Vesey went to the penalty box and Union sophomore forward Ryan Scarfo notched a power-play goal, his seventh of the year. Union took the lead a minute later when top-line forward Sebastien Vidmar scored his first of the year.
“[In the first period] the goalie made some great saves and we hit some posts, but then Union really played well in the second period.” Donato said. “We helped out by just fundamentally not being as sound as we were in the first period.”
Playing from behind, Harvard kept the pressure on, peppering Union’s Alex Sakellaropoulos with 38 shots on the night and battling for position around the net. The push paid off early in the third when Crimson freshman Michael Floodstrand tied up the game at 3-3 with his second goal of the season just 1:25 into the period, assisted by fellow freshman Ryan Donato and junior Luke Esposito.
The tie was short-lived, as a power-play shot from Scarfo found the back of the net again two minutes later, allowing the Dutchmen to quickly retake a one-goal lead. With the third period ticking away, Harvard continued its offensive-zone onslaught, and Sherman eventually leveled the score with under three minutes to play. His goal, just his second of the year, saved the Crimson from recording just its second loss on the season, with its only defeat coming against No. 3/2 Quinnipiac (14-0-2, 5-0-2).
Harvard will face Union once again at home on February 13, but not before it plays Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on Saturday in Troy, N.Y. Harvard handily defeated RPI over the Thanksgiving break, 4-0.
Friday’s draw, though, was made even more sour for Harvard after junior Alexander Kerfoot suffered an upper body injury late in the third period. Kerfoot had to be helped off the ice, and Donato would not comment on the injury after the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 6, 2015, at 6:45 p.m. 
TROY, N.Y.—In a rematch of last Sunday’s bout at Notre Dame, the No. 8/8 Harvard men’s hockey team (6-1-3, 4-1-3 ECAC) and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (8-6-3, 4-1-3) finished the game in a scoreless tie despite an offensive onslaught from the Crimson.
Sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen made 32 saves for his fourth shutout in seven starts while RPI keeper Jason Kasdorf turned in the performance of the night with 43 stops of his own.
After yielding four goals in a tie with Union on Friday, Madsen resumed building upon his otherworldly early season numbers. The 6-foot-5 California native entered the season without a single career NCAA start but now leads all Division I goaltenders in goals against average (0.98) and save percentage (.966).
“This is a little bit of a learning curve for Merrick,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He looked very calm and composed tonight and gave us a lot of confidence on the bench.”
Madsen, by all accounts, has been unfazed by his stats and was quick to praise his defensemen.
“Those guys have been so supportive time and time again,” Madsen said. “Everything that I have given up up front, they’ve been the first ones on it and getting it out of the zone.”
Despite a 54-second five-on-three opportunity for RPI late in the first period, Madsen’s toughest challenge would come in the third period, in which the Engineers outshot Harvard, 16-8. For most of the game, the ice tilted in the other direction, as the Crimson pinned the hosts in their own zone early to capture a 33-12 advantage in shots through two periods.
Kasdorf turned away a breakaway opportunity by freshman Ryan Donato early in the first period and remained uncrackable. Through nine starts, the senior sits just 10 spots below Madsen in the national save percentage rankings with a .937 success rate.
Crimson co-captain Jimmy Vesey came the closest to beating Kasdorf with a shot off the crossbar late in the third period.
Harvard finished the night 4-for-4 on the penalty kill and 0-for-2 on the power play. Following the game, Ted Donato hinted that his team could have used more opportunities on the man advantage and alluded to his frustrations with the night’s officiating.
“In this game, it is tough to score just five-on-five,” Donato said. “I know we all have great goaltenders, but if you’re asking me, it’s not healthy to have so many zero-zero games.”
Harvard skated Saturday without the services of junior center Alex Kerfoot, who left Friday’s game late in the third period with an upper body injury. Junior Tyler Moy took his place on the first line. Senior forward Colin Blackwell missed his sixth straight game.
