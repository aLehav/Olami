After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During this time of the year, the bulletin boards by Harvard Yard are usually brimming with multi-colored posters. Advertisements range from themed dances to event announcements, from calls for research study participants to auditions. This year, the boards stand barren with meager posts on organic chemistry tutoring and saxophone lessons. A few yards further, beyond the University’s high walls, men with bohemian beards, blankets, and help signs sit by the campus center singing or playing chess. Harvard’s high walls not only separate the University from its homeless neighbors, but also from the non-affluent students who otherwise could attend.
Amid the pandemic, the school welcomed a new class onto its campus — one that reflects the enormous strides Harvard has made on racial diversity. The Class of 2024 includes record numbers of Black and Asian American students. However, as usual, students from affluent households and private schools are overrepresented. The student bodies in selective colleges do not reflect the population of high achievers, who are dispersed across income brackets. Admissions practices inclined towards accepting students from the top income quartile produces sustained inequality — which has only been exacerbated by COVID-19.
Harvard can respond to these inequities. It can be a catalyst in generating intergenerational mobility for students with acute needs and particularly in the era of Zoom classes. To do so Harvard must expand on its commitment to diversity by eliminating legacy admissions, ignoring family financial contributions in admissions considerations, and most importantly, establishing quota-based affirmative action for class. The quota can be based on household income brackets, so that, for example, 1 percent of the student body would come from the top one percent.
Why should Harvard do this? Because of its own long-standing commitment to diversity, as reiterated in its compelling legal brief in its high-profile admissions trial, which Harvard won. The purpose of affirmative action is to have a student body that represents the diversity of the nation — diversity defined not just by race, but by class, region, sexual orientation, and other important facets of people’s identities. Class-based admissions would complement current race-based affirmative action and further Harvard’s goals of diversity, equity, and inclusivity.
Coronavirus is not need-blind, and neither is education. Nor are either equalizers. The supposedly neutral meritocratic system does not deserve veneration when we examine the glaring but overlooked disparities that are created by current admissions practices.
“Merit” is not earned, but passed down as privilege. Wealthier parents’ children tend to have higher incomes post-college. This merit cycle sustains an admissions system based on inheritance, often relegating poorer students to lower resourced community colleges (if they attend college at all), mirroring segregation in other segments of society and restricting intergenerational mobility. In this struggling economy, limiting world-class education to a higher socioeconomic group would lead to even larger class and racial inequities.
Yale Law School professor Daniel Markovits, in his book “The Meritocracy Trap,” notes that more students at Harvard and Yale come from households in the top one percent of the income distribution than from the entire bottom 50 percent. This statistic raises eyebrows: Is merit concentrated in the students from the top one percent of all households?
Even with the current system of affirmative action, minority students, not just white students, at Harvard largely hail from wealthy households. Are wealthy students of color smarter than economically disadvantaged students of color? The singular focus on race in affirmative action disproportionately benefits the most privileged among the minority, too.
Harvard can escape this trap by implementing class-conscious admissions policies. The school could thus make a strong commitment to welcoming students from lower-income brackets with generous financial aid. Administrators may object to this policy for financial reasons, citing the pragmatism in admitting affluent students, but money alone cannot be a driving force in determining institutional priorities at the world’s richest university.
Higher education institutions should strive for class diversity. With the largest endowment of any university, Harvard is best suited to answer this call for change and set a new trend. It is time that universities take economic diversity seriously so that students from all walks of life are fully represented in higher education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What’s the point of a lie when everyone knows we’re lying? Why do we often resign to lies we’re told, aware of their falsehood? When it comes to our habits of dishonesty, it’s not always clear why we behave the way we do. As early as 395 A.D., Augustine of Hippo started questioning the intention of a lie and contemplating what constitutes a true liar — is it one who “wished to say a false thing?” Or “the other, because he wished to deceive?” Today, even still, our motives remain unclear. Particularly when technology makes us all the more liable to getting caught red-handed.
I asked my friends once “why didn’t you tag us in your Instagram story?” after they had posted a photo of our group excursion including some but not all group members’ names. Surprised by confrontation, they averted their eyes and scrambled to explain with variations of “can I edit it? I will try to add you guys!” They pleaded innocence while feigning to address the action and without actually doing so.
Being excluded from the post was far less insulting than the dismissive comments that followed. Within a group of well-educated students, albeit overly educated on the topic of social media, their excuses were flimsy. It’s elementary knowledge for the majority of those our age, and for my avid Instagramming friends especially, that a story can’t be edited after it’s posted. For them to lie — to suggest they didn’t know how to operate the app — was patronizing.
Excuses surrounding online actions are familiar to us all. People tell us they didn’t get our texts, emails, didn’t see our social media requests. The list goes on. We imagine our communications symbolically “got lost in the mail,” for the sake of moving on. It’s hard to actually believe that, though, when we know this “mail” is an advanced network viewable from anywhere on earth by so much as glancing at our watches – not one that runs on pieces of paper getting torn or lost.
Of course, we’re flooded with so much information daily, it’s perfectly possible some things go unseen. I’m not criticizing people for being busy. But, when we start pointing fingers at hackers for inappropriate posts, for example — when we blame the internet for our faults or forgotten tasks, we offend those on the receiving end. Not because of the mistake itself, but because of the underestimation of others’ intelligence. We all know just how glued we are to our phones and laptops. On many platforms, we can literally see when others are active, invasive as this is. We are so ultra-connected, we know so much, that excuses lose validity. They become lies.
I have lied. We all have. We do so very often, according to leading expert on the psychology of lying Bella DePaulo. In a study published by the American Psychological Association, DePaulo reported college students lie in one of their every three social interactions. Through several social experiments, she concluded that lying is an everyday behavior — “a fact of social life”. Our loss of honesty is a natural, in fact healthy, stage of human cognitive development.
DePaulo asserts that we lie for any of several major reasons, including to promote our own image or protect the feelings of others. But lies concerning virtual affairs can be verified far more easily than those pertaining to real life. Lies are only lies when the liar has more information than the person being lied to. The point of a lie is to deceive. If we all have knowledge of it — that the text delivered because our phone tells us so, for example — it defeats the purpose. So my question remains: why do we really do it?
Behavioral economics professor Dan Ariely clarifies our seemingly senseless behavior. He sees lies less as deliberate, discrete actions and more as subtle methods of cheating the system. He says lying is an exercise in cost-benefit analysis. We lie just enough to profit as much as possible while maintaining an honest enough perception of ourselves.
In other words, our lies are ambiguous, so we could get caught but often won’t. We cheat just a little when we say things that are believable enough in our own eyes and those of others. In doing so, we can tell ourselves we’re not bad people. Because honesty feels like a harsher and less convenient choice when it boils down to something like “I didn’t reply to you because I didn’t want to.”
In my situation, there was no way for me to prove my friends genuinely didn’t know they couldn’t edit the post. Similarly, we’ll never log into our email recipient’s account to check if he really didn’t get that email. We have to live with uncertainty, and in the meantime, try to reign in our cynicism. The internet is clouded with strange ambiguity, and as long as we’re lacking evidence, our suspected deception will remain speculation rather than confirmation.
For better or worse, we have internalized that these daily events are mostly minor offenses. We don’t want to make waves or accuse others every time we feel that doubt. But I believe confrontation on this front is occasionally warranted. I don’t regret having been direct with my friends; repressing ourselves when an offense, like exclusion, is clear will only lead to more anxiety. Judging whether confrontation is appropriate, it seems, is just one of our many balancing acts.
All said, it may be unnatural how much we monitor each other. Perhaps we know and share too much. Regardless, engagement requires accountability. We can receive so much information and education from the internet; we can share our lives and connect so easily through social media. These are, no doubt, enormous privileges.
But with great knowledge comes great responsibility. A resource that allows for connection and opportunity is a gift, but we cannot expect to take without giving. Nor can we be selectively accountable. With summer internships, job applications, or schoolwork, we are at our most responsible – we let ourselves down when we fail to be.
Our sense of duty relaxes, though, when it comes to what we owe others. Their disappointment in our actions, or lack thereof, is virtually painless to us when we aren’t looking them in the eyes. And when we are faced with a human rather than a contact, it’s easier to evade conflict altogether. But if we’re capable of one difficult task, we must be of the other. We should grant, if not more, just as much importance to humanity as we do our personal objectives. Ultimately, our own successes will be worthless if we don’t preserve the human relationships that make life truly rich.
So complete honesty is too much to ask for, and it might even go against our nature. Increased accountability and estimation of others, however, especially when we have nothing to gain – now that would be an earnest goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2019-20 academic year marked a five-year low for overall disciplinary action at Harvard College, according to Administrative Board statistics updated Thursday.
The number of students admonished for conduct violating the College’s social behavior or academic procedure policies dropped from 42 during the 2018-19 cycle to 17 this past year; probations for such violations fell from 30 to 17.
The number of undergraduates required to withdraw for misconduct, meanwhile, declined more modestly, inching downwards from 10 in 2019-20 to nine this past year. The requirement to withdraw — the most serious disciplinary sanction short of the rare dismissal — obliges a student to fully disengage from Harvard and find full-time, paid, non-academic employment for at least six months before petitioning to return.
The Ad Board — chaired by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and composed of around 30 College administrators and faculty — is charged with disciplining students whose conduct violates College policies, approving student petitions, and enforcing academic standards.
The number of undergraduates the Ad Board put on probation or required to withdraw for unsatisfactory academic records also reached a five-year low this past year. In 2019-20, the Ad Board’s academic review landed 54 students on probation and required 17 to withdraw — down from 121 and 40, respectively, in 2018-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic put significant academic stress on students this past spring, forcing a rapid switch to all-remote classes. Students returning to distant time zones, struggling families, or home environments without a quiet place to work faced extra hurdles completing the semester. The College attempted to ease some of this pressure — and promote educational equity — by adopting a universal satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system for the spring.
The Ad Board statistics on student petitions also suggest the College allowed a flexible approach to final examinations. It approved an unprecedented 323 student petitions for “special” time extensions last year — up from just 22 during the 2018-2019 cycle, per the report.
The Ad Board also approved 103 petitions for study abroad — again, the lowest figure in the past five years. Ultimately, Harvard suspended all study abroad for the fall 2020 semester due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Climate researchers discovered that changes in Northern Hemisphere sea levels contribute to the shrinking of the Antarctic ice sheet, according to a study published in Nature on Nov. 25.
The study — led by Natalya A. Gomez, an assistant Earth and planetary sciences professor at McGill University — expands the scientific understanding of the global interconnectedness of climate change.
“Just by understanding how the system works better and how the ice sheets respond to past climate, we can better understand how to build a model of how it might respond in the future,” Gomez said. “This is particularly important because we haven’t seen the kind of warming that we’re headed toward in the future.”
The research team also included Jerry X. Mitrovica, an Earth and Planetary Sciences professor at Harvard; Michael E. Weber, a geology researcher at University of Bonn; Peter U. Clark, a Earth sciences professor at Oregon State University; and Holly K. Han, a graduate student at McGill.
Gomez initially began studying ice sheets as a graduate student in the Mitrovica Group at Harvard, where she found evidence of the relationship between sea levels and melting ice sheets. She found that melting ice sheets in Antarctica lead to lower sea levels nearby — a counterintuitive finding — and higher sea levels in the Northern Hemisphere.
Gomez extended this research by asking how melting ice on one pole of the Earth affects sea levels on the other side of the world. The researchers modeled how Antarctic ice sheets change size in response to atmospheric shifts and combined these insights with data on global sea level changes.
“If you melted the ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere that raises sea level in the Antarctic and the Antarctic ice sheet dynamics actually depend on the water levels they’re at,” Gomez said.
The team also looked at different types of geological records to study patterns of ice sheet movement. They identified periods of accelerated ice loss — known as “ice sheet discharge events” — as well as periods of accelerated rise in sea levels.
“Our research linked these two types of records together where we saw that the increased sea level rise at the Antarctic was actually driving the increased output of ice at those times,” Gomez said.
Han said the team’s findings highlight the importance of considering the “bigger picture” of regional warming.
“The implication of this study is that under our warming world, we have now two remaining ice sheets in Greenland and in the Southern Hemisphere,” Han said. “Once an ice sheet in one hemisphere starts to go, then the ice sheet in the other hemisphere is also in danger.”

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said she is “hopeful” that Harvard will be “close to, if not entirely, fully operational” by the fall of 2021 in an interview with The Crimson Thursday.
“I’m hoping that 2021 will just be completely different,” Gay said. “I am just so ready to turn the page on this year, and I’m kind of optimistic by nature, so I’m really hopeful that we will be close to — if not entirely — fully operational next fall.”
“At the end of the day, we have to take steps that both allow us to pursue our teaching and research mission, but also protect the health and safety of our community,” Gay added.
Gay and other administrators announced Tuesday that Harvard will expand the number of undergraduates permitted to live in the dorms to 3,100 — roughly half of all College students — in the spring of 2021, prioritizing upperclassmen and those facing challenging learning environments.
“Our ambition for the spring is to continue to make progress toward our goal of returning to a full residential experience for our undergraduates and taking that next big step on that path, and also to continue to support graduate students and their academic progress,” Gay said Thursday.
Harvard administrators had said since July that seniors would receive priority for housing on campus in the spring of 2021 should any students be invited to the dorms.
One of the reasons Harvard decided to bring back juniors rather than sophomores for the spring was to allow juniors to research on campus in preparation for senior thesis work, according to Gay. She said during a faculty meeting Tuesday that she had “not foreclosed” the possibility of allowing non-resident students to research on campus as well.
Gay said Thursday that the pandemic is “too unpredictable” to say whether she anticipates FAS will make adjustments to its spring planning before students move in, but that they are prepared to do so.
“We are continuously monitoring the public health conditions both on our campus and beyond our campus around the country,” Gay said. “We’re prepared to revise our plans in light of what we learn, especially if it’s in advance of any scheduled move in.”
Asked whether Harvard would give students more time to move out than the five days it gave students to vacate campus in the spring of 2020 if it were necessary to de-densify campus during the spring of 2021, Gay similarly said the unpredictability of the pandemic prevents her from speculating.
“Everything about the pandemic is so unpredictable, so I really just can’t speculate,” Gay said. “The guidance for the students who will be coming to campus in the spring and we’ve provided in the fall was that they should pack light and they should arrive with a rapid move out plan in their back pocket.”
This fall, campus life was markedly different for the roughly 25 percent of undergraduates — including non-international freshmen and select upperclassmen — living in the dorms.
The College asked those students to sign a Community Compact promising to abide by public health guidelines, to submit to testing three times each week, and to eschew most social contact in favor of Zoom. It also established a group to adjudicate violations of social distancing rules, the Community Council, which at one point dismissed three freshmen from the dorms after they held an illicit gathering of at least six people.
Students living on campus in the spring will also have to sign a Community Compact and abide by similarly strict public health protocols.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three political strategists joined the Harvard Institute of Politics’s director of polling John Della Volpe on Thursday to virtually discuss the impact of youth voters in the 2020 elections as well as the upcoming Senate runoff races in Georgia at this semester’s final John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
Della Volpe, who also advised on youth engagement for Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign, posed questions to the panelists, who included Ashley Allison, the Biden campaign’s national coalitions director; Peter D. Hamby, the host of Snapchat’s Good Luck America; and Nsé Ufot, who serves as CEO of the New Georgia Project, an organization dedicated to increasing voter turnout in the state.
Ufot said a surge in political organizing helped turn Georgia blue in the 2020 presidential election.
“I would say that the demographic shift that we’re seeing in Georgia is the fire, but organizing has been the accelerant,” she said. “It is the demographic shifts, for sure, but it is the sustained, sophisticated, long-term, multiple cycle organizing effort that is designed to harness the power that is coming out of that demographic shift and turn it into real policy and political changes.”
Statewide efforts in Georgia to mobilize young people to become involved in politics led the state to achieve the nation’s highest jump in youth voter turnout from the 2016 to 2020 presidential election cycles.
In the 2020 presidential election, Georgia flipped Democratic for the first time since 1992 — an outcome largely credited to high voter turnout paired with demographic changes that favored non-white residents. As of the end of November, Georgia voters had requested more than 940,000 absentee ballots for the Senate runoff elections.
At the event, panelists looked ahead to January, when both of Georgia’s Senate seats will proceed to runoff elections. Democratic challengers T. Jonathan “Jon” Ossoff and Raphael G. Warnock will vie against incumbent Senators David A. Perdue Jr. (R-Ga.) and Kelly L. Loeffler (R-Ga.), respectively, in an election that will determine which political party will secure control of the Senate.
Allison, who worked on the Biden campaign, said Democrats should invest in grassroots organizing to clinch Georgia’s Senate races.
“I think we have to be careful in letting our motivation be rooted in a person, and our motivation is actually rooted in movements,” she said. “Regardless if we have the Senate, the White House, and the House, we still need to resource our local groups that are building the trust and community so that our movement, and our efforts, and our mobilization aren’t rooted on one person but in a real collective sense of power and self-ownership.”
Hamby shared ways to politically engage young people, who “don’t think politics works for them.”
“Among young voters, there’s low levels of social trust,” he said. “The ads that they found worked in their creative testing were ads that took something like the movement for Black Lives, it took something like climate change, and turned it into an affirmative message around voting.”

A team of researchers from Harvard and the University of Cambridge unveiled new research last month that uses novel techniques to examine how and when early tetrapods — four-limbed animals — transitioned from living in marine environments to terrestrial ones.
In the study published Nov. 24, Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Stephanie E. Pierce and graduate student researcher Blake V. Dickson used an analysis program that modeled and quantified changes in the humerus — a bone in the arm — over time. They then made predictions about how these evolutionary changes might have eased terrestrial movement.
“It's not surprising that the humerus changed in morphology. We were expecting that to happen, because you can see it in the fossil,” Pierce said. “The trick was trying to capture that in a quantitative fashion. And then once we have that, how do we actually predict what the function was?”
“We had this prediction that the longer the humerus gets, the better the animal would be at moving limbs back and forth, which is of course really important when you're walking on land,” she said.
Pierce added that these changes were gradual, though.
“These early tetrapods came up essentially with a solution to be just good enough to venture out onto land but maintain their ancestral ties to water, so that they can continue to feed, they could continue to breed — all the things that are associated with having that ancestral habitat.”
She noted that, in the study, she and the other researchers concluded that tetrapods underwent an intermediate period between living on water and living on land.
“[Tetrapods] were being sort of pushed up this terrestrial landscape but also being pulled back into their ancestral aquatic habitat,” she explained. “They had pressures that they still needed to feed in water; they still needed to reproduce in water. So, they have most of their biology still tied to water.”
Pierce said she believes the methods and findings of this study may help inform further research into evolutionary biology, as the process can be extrapolated to other bones besides the humerus.
“We still have much more to learn, because we've only looked at one bone. And the signal that you get from one bone might be different than the signal you get from another,” Pierce said.
University of Cambridge paleontology professor Jennifer A. Clack and paleontology researcher Timothy R. Smithson were co-authors on the paper.

Zaosong Zheng, a former researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to lying to customs officials following charges he tried to smuggle cancer research to China.
Zheng, a 31-year-old who arrived in the United States from China in 2018, was arrested Dec. 10, 2019 at Boston Logan International Airport. Customs officials found 21 vials of biological material in a sock packed in his suitcase which allegedly came from a lab at Beth Israel, where he worked.
Zheng agreed in the plea to leave the country following his Jan. 6, 2021 sentencing hearing, though a judge will ultimately decide whether Zheng should face further penalties. The false statements charge comes with a potential of up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
As part of the plea deal on the false statements charge, prosecutors agreed to drop the charge of smuggling goods out of the country.
Customs officers had flagged Zheng as high-risk for smuggling biological material; when they were searching his luggage, he repeatedly denied carrying research materials, according to an affidavit. He later said the vials “had nothing to do with his research,” then said a friend gave him the vials. He eventually confessed to stealing them from his lab and said he planned to take the materials to his own laboratory in China and publish a paper in his name.
Norman Zalkind, one of Zheng’s attorneys, said Thursday he was glad the two sides were able to reach a joint recommendation for the judge.
“We’re never happy with any kind of a guilty finding, but we’re happy that the government and us came to a resolution we both agreed on and both felt was fair,” he said.
Beth Israel fired Zheng following his arrest. In an emailed statement Thursday, hospital spokesperson Teresa M. Herbert wrote that “any efforts to compromise research undermine the hard work of our faculty and staff to advance patient care.”
“We are grateful for the diligence and professionalism of federal law enforcement in this case,” she added.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton and Harvard Medical School spokesperson Laura DeCoste declined to comment.
Zheng’s arrest formed part of a recent crackdown on intellectual property theft and was followed by authorities arresting then-Harvard Chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber on allegations that he lied to federal authorities about his research affiliations in China. Lieber has pleaded not guilty and vowed to fight the charges, which include making false statements and tax offenses, at trial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Source, a farm-to-table pizzeria, opened to the public last month in Harvard Square.
The restaurant — located on Church Street at the site of Cambridge’s first fire station — is what first-time restaurant owner Daniel Roughan calls “a modern take on the local gastropub and traditional pizza parlor.”
“We are a farm-to-table Neapolitan pizza restaurant,” Roughan said. “What I pride myself on and what I built this concept off of was attempting to source 90 percent of all of our product from within 100 miles of our front door.”
“It's just all about putting back into the economy that supports us,” he added.
In addition to featuring spirits from local distillers and a beer list from local breweries, Source relies on local farms to shape its menu, Roughan said.
“We are doing hyper-local sourcing as much as possible, and with that, our menu is a hyper-seasonal menu because, of course, living in New England, our temperature tends to fluctuate. So, one week we might be able to get produce from one farm and then they might have a frost, so we have to pivot and grab it from another farm,” he said.
Roughan said the restaurant — which opened shortly before Thanksgiving — has encountered a difficult first couple weeks.
“In the restaurant business, you rarely ever want to open the weekend of Thanksgiving, and then, of course, you rarely want to open heading into winter, and you never want to open during a pandemic,” he said. “So I guess I have the hat trick on that.”
“There's just not a lot of people out there and the people that are out there are hesitant about going out dining,” he added.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said despite these obstacles, Roughan has “done everything right.”
“He's just been such a positive, optimistic guy, and he really believes in his product,” she said. “He worked so hard on building up a location and making it look really fun and beautiful and taking advantage, really capitalizing on the location.”
“We're excited to have him and just wish him all the best because he could not be opening in a more challenging and difficult time,” she added.
Roughan said, despite the difficulties around opening his restaurant, he had his eyes set on the first Source restaurant opening in Harvard Square.
“Harvard Square, as most people know, is, in my opinion and many others’, one of the most famous and well-known squares in the world,” he said. “It's bathed in tradition and history and culture, and I just really wanted our first restaurant to be a part of that, as a symbol of something that hopefully will be around a long time.”
“It's something that is about the locals and the local economy,” Roughan added.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Thursday that Harvard aimed to bring as many students to campus as possible in the spring while allowing for public health guidelines.
The University's plan — which Bacow, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced on Tuesday — preferences seniors, currently enrolled juniors, and students with learning environment or time zone challenges.
Bacow said he, Gay, and Khurana “concluded collectively” that they wanted to afford the maximum possible number of students the opportunity to reside on campus, so long as they could maintain the limit of one student per bedroom.
Though the choice of which subset of students to allow back on campus fell to the College, rather than the University, Bacow said the decision was “largely determined by considerations of academic progress.”
Bacow also elaborated on the University’s choice not to expand undergraduate housing beyond current dorms, which could have enabled more students to return.
“We have a tradition of housing undergraduates on campus, and we think that's an important part of the Harvard College experience,” he said. “If we put undergraduates in housing throughout the city, they would not have the kind of support that they have on campus.”
“We also recognize that we've had far less issues with community spread of the virus on campus than we have had off campus, so putting more undergraduates off campus potentially would put more people at risk,” he added.
Administrators waited as long as they could to release the decision to maximize available information, including about possible vaccine distribution, Bacow said. He also emphasized the plan is subject to change should conditions in Massachusetts worsen.
“We are always going to prioritize public health,” Bacow said. “If we don't think we can have approximately 3,100 students on campus safely, then as we said in our message, we will revisit our plan.”
Bacow said he understands why students who will not be allowed to return to campus are frustrated by the announcement.
“We understand why they're upset,” he said. “We wanted to bring everybody back. If we could have brought everybody back safely, we would. But we had to ask everybody to sacrifice.”
As for sophomores, the only class year not specifically invited to campus in either the fall or spring, Bacow said the University is looking to Harvard Summer School “to try and give them additional time on campus, recognizing that we have not been able to accommodate them under the current circumstances.”
“We're trying to do our best in a difficult situation in which it's literally not possible to make everybody happy,” he added.
Nonetheless, Bacow said he empathized with sophomores and their current situation.
“If I were in their position I would also be disappointed,” he said. “But I hope they'll also be understanding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu ’07 spoke about her background and public service work at a webinar hosted by several Harvard student organizations Thursday evening.
Wu shared her experience as a student at Harvard College and Harvard Law School at the event, which was organized by Harvard Kennedy School’s Asian American Pacific Islander Caucus, Harvard Law School’s Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association.
Wu, the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, is the first Asian-American woman to serve on Boston’s city council and the first woman of color to serve as the council's president, a role she held from 2016 to 2018. Wu is also running for mayor of Boston in 2021.
Wu never expected to end up with a career in politics, saying she had been shielded from it growing up.
“Politics was corruption. Politics was all these things we were not supposed to be getting involved or getting in trouble with,” Wu said. “I think if you had found me at the end of undergrad sitting with a group of my blockmates and said, ‘Which of you in the circle would be least likely to run for office?’ Everyone would have said ‘me.’”
Wu concentrated in Economics while at Harvard College and initially worked in consulting after graduation.
“I wanted to do Psychology and I really wanted to do Social Studies, but my parents insisted that it was impractical. So we kind of settled on Economics,” Wu said.
Wu soon had to leave her consulting job and return to her childhood home to help raise her sisters and care for her mother, who began to face mental health struggles. That experience made Wu realize “how much people are dehumanized” in places of service.
She then attended Harvard Law School to explore how the law shapes experiences like the ones her mother had. There, she met Elizabeth Warren, who was then a professor teaching commercial law.
“By my 3L year of law school, she was running for Senate. So I showed up at office hours, asked how I could help and she put me to work just organizing in Boston — my first political experience,” Wu said.
Wu remarked on the “power” of a broad coalition and mobilizing minority groups to vote, emphasizing what she views as the necessity of using her own story as a “vehicle” to connect with others’ needs and experiences.
“The [Asian American and Pacific Islander] population of Boston is only nine percent of the city’s total, and Boston is a city where no single ethnic group or racial group is a majority,” Wu said. “To represent the entire city, you truly need to understand, reflect and build a multicultural, multiracial, multigenerational coalition.”
Oliver Ma, a joint-degree student at the Law School and the Kennedy School, and the co-president of the Pan-Asian Graduate Students Alliance, wrote in an email that many aspects of Wu’s story were “relatable,” and that a large turnout of Asian-American students at the event was “heartwarming.”
“Councilor Wu has been my hero for years,” Ma wrote. “In 2016 and 2020, Trump made inroads among Asian Americans. So I am really glad we could have Michelle, a powerful, progressive, Asian American voice, to come speak. I am inspired by Michelle's public service attitude and her willingness to forge her own paths in law school and beyond.”
Likewise, Kyle J. Witzigman, a Kennedy School student and representative of the Asian American and Pacific Islander Caucus, wrote in an email that Wu’s work to promote coalitions and empower individuals overlaps with the AAPI Caucus’s on-campus mission. Additionally, Witzigman remarked that Wu demonstrated how she applied her life experiences to public service.
“You have a unique vantage point to view how policy is shaped upstream and understand its effects downstream. When she described her upbringing - how her mother struggled with mental illness, how she became her mother’s caregiver and raised her sisters - I could see how her foundational grit, passion, and compassion fuel her work today,” Witzigman wrote. “She demonstrates how leadership can be grounded in humility.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Brammy Rajakumar ’23, pursuing a joint concentration in English and Chemistry was an easy choice.
Rajakumar, an inactive Crimson news editor, was one of more than 1,300 sophomores to declare their concentration last month. She said she wanted to merge her passion for the humanities with an ultimate desire to pursue a career in medicine.
She realized she could achieve her goal after taking Humanities 10a: “A Humanities Colloquium: From Homer to Valeria Luiselli” and Humanities 10b: “A Humanities Colloquium: From James Joyce to Homer,” two introductory survey courses in literature and expository writing.
“I was able to get a lot of experiences and background knowledge for my humanities interests from Hum 10,” Rajakumar said, referring to the courses and “I really took to heart the combination of STEM and humanities.”
She is now one of the leaders of the “Hum Alum” program, which helps freshmen navigate the humanities at Harvard by providing insights into wide-ranging topics such as class and career choices.
Yet, despite the popularity of courses like Hum 10, humanities departments have found themselves with fewer concentrators each year; contrastingly, students have increasingly flocked to concentrations like Economics and Computer Science.
“As is true nationally, at Harvard, the humanities have struggled to maintain their historical levels of concentrators since around 2008,” Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey said.
Of the 18 concentrations in the Arts and Humanities division, 10 have experienced significant decreases in numbers of concentrators, six remained relatively steady, and two saw slight increases between 2015 and 2019.
“The concentration numbers in the humanities have been on the decline in the College, and that's just something that's just been a reality for some time,” said Courtney Bickel Lamberth, director of undergraduate studies in Comparative Study of Religion.
For concentrations with smaller numbers of students, however, trends alone are not enough to predict the number of concentrators in future years.
Gojko J. Barjamovic, director of undergraduate studies in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, said looking at numeric trends is not as helpful for his department, which has had fewer than 10 concentrators for the past five years.
“We have had sort of a slight increase in the number of concentrators over the last five years. But we're dealing with such low numbers,” Barjamovic said. “Counting numbers doesn't make all that much sense.”
In contrast, faculty in other fields noted an increase in the number of students who choose to do secondaries and joint concentrations in the humanities.
Music professor Suzannah Clark said that relatively easy requirements allowed new students to explore their interests through secondaries in Music.
“A broader range of students are getting secondaries, and they're doing a broader range of things in order to get their secondary,” Clark said.
According to Linguistics professor Kathryn Davidson, her department has found that students are able to explore their interests from an “interdisciplinary” perspective through secondary fields.
Still, as interdisciplinary studies become more common, the numbers of students concentrating solely in the humanities remains in flux. Despite the risk of future decline, Bernhard Nickel, the director of undergraduate studies in Philosophy said he is not concerned about concentration numbers in the Philosophy department.
“For a lot of students, it’d be wonderful if they took three, four, five courses in Philosophy, and used the tools that they can learn in Philosophy courses and took them elsewhere,” he said. “Our work really has been much more garnering that kind of interest, as opposed to trying to increase the raw concentration numbers, because having about 30 to 35 students is a really nice size for us.”
Kelsey said the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a “challenging year for every concentration,” as they all experienced lower numbers as compared to previous years. This decrease is particularly noticeable in humanities concentrations, according to Kelsey, who noted concerns that students may have about their career prospects.
“I think the more anxious people are in the world about their financial futures — the more precarious they feel materially — the more challenging they may find it to commit themselves to a humanities concentration,” Kelsey said.
Debra J. Levine, director of undergraduate studies for Theater, Dance, and Media, said the pandemic has affected not only concentration numbers but also the program’s techniques for reaching out to students.
“It was much easier when a student took a class in Farkas Hall, meandered into my office and just started to talk about their interests, and realized that they could do this,” Levine said. “Having something in real life and centralized is really helpful.”
Kathy Richman, director of undergraduate studies in Romance Languages and Literatures, agreed.
“I think the spontaneous word of mouth doesn't happen as easily right now,” she said.
Although the pandemic has presented challenges to concentrations across the College, many humanities professors remain optimistic about the learning opportunities virtual education can provide.
“It has been fairly successful, but it does make demands on everybody,” Peter K. Bol, professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, said of the online teaching.
Ruth S. Lingford, director of undergraduate studies for Art, Film, and Visual Studies, said faculty in her department have found creative solutions to the challenges of online learning during the pandemic.
“It's true we really miss our wonderful studios and our wonderful film equipment,” she said. “But at the same time, when we're shipping equipment out to students remotely, we're finding ways of teaching effectively in a remote setting.”
Kelsey said humanities students and faculty have worked diligently to overcome the limitations of online learning.
“We are using this time of the pandemic to do a lot of innovative thinking about the future of the humanities at Harvard,” he said.
Though many faculty and students cited concerns about humanities concentrations not being conducive to career opportunities, other students and faculty disputed this claim and defended the value of the humanities in providing analytical skills necessary in the job market.
Audrey N. Dilgarde ’22, a Romance Languages and Literatures concentrator, said following her passions has not negatively impacted a potential business career.
“It certainly hasn't hindered any opportunities. I've never been laughed out of a room because I study RLL and not Economics,” Dilgarde said.
Joseph F. Nagy ’74, the interim chair of Folklore and Mythology, agreed that concentrating in the humanities does not automatically hinder career prospects for students.
“The range of careers and the range of ways in which people found familiarity with the study of folklore mythology is really quite remarkable,” Nagy said. “It forms a very sturdy underpinning to a lot of fascinating career trajectories.”
Richman, the Romance Languages and Literature director of undergraduate studies, argued the humanities can provide students with a flexible background for the changing job market.
“You learn to analyze and write well, and those skills are valuable in any career or in any field,” Richman said.
Kelsey said a goal of the Arts and Humanities Division is to add value to every student’s college experience, regardless of passions or concentrations.
“The humanities are not simply for people who are going to become professional humanists,” Kelsey said. “Humanities add value to every life. And they add a value that sticks with people from cradle to grave.”
