After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Police are investigating a Harvard staff member’s report that he was robbed by two men early Tuesday morning on Church Street.
The complainant told authorities that he was walking on Church Street with two new acquaintances around 2:50 a.m. on Tuesday when one of the men pinned him against a wall and the other brandished what may have been a firearm. The complainant, who has not been named, was not injured. He said that the two assailants fled down Brattle Street in the direction of Fresh Pond.
Steven G. Catalano, a spokesperson for the Harvard University Police Department, announced the investigation in an email to the Harvard community on Tuesday afternoon.
Catalano wrote that the Cambridge Police are handling the matter because it did not occur on University property.
In the advisory, Catalano included the department’s standard instructions to those who feel that they may be being followed. Those instructions advise heading for well-lit areas, contacting the authorities, and not resisting if an assailant flashes a weapon or otherwise acts in a threatening manner.
The Cambridge Police said that they had no additional information to release on Tuesday afternoon.
