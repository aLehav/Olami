Back in April, we here at Flyby got wind of HUDS’ plan to replace the coffee served in dining halls.  HUDS coffee rarely lights a fire in even the most sleep-deprived eyes, being the kind of beverage one consumes out of necessity rather than for pleasure.  But what is Harvard if not a place where our dining options are constantly changing—what ever happened to swai, anyway?  We here at Flyby welcomed the prospect of a new brew to wake us up halfway through our 10 a.m. lecture… we mean, bright and early at a dignified hour of the morning.
The competition was fierce among our 4 worthy contenders: Peet’s, Pierce Bros., Sun Coffee Roasters, and the incumbent Seattle’s Best.  Our Flyby coffee experts came down in Peet’s corner, for sound and legitimate reasons, and then along with the rest of the student population, patiently awaited (and probably forgot about) the result of the competition.
Well, wait no longer folks, because we finally have a verdict for you:
Yes, the winner was Pierce Bros. coffee.  The Greenfield, Mass. company uses only organic and Fair Trade beans.  Their air-roasted beans apparently provide a smoother and less bitter taste, two attributes we can all agree our coffee choices at breakfast could do with having.
