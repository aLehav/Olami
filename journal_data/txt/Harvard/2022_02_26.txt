After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s never been a better time to be Dua Lipa. Since the release of her highly acclaimed second album “Future Nostalgia” in March 2020, her career has only grown. She’s spent much of the past two years promoting the album, which won her a third Grammy Award and saw its fifth single, “Levitating,” be named the top song of 2021 on the Billboard Hot 100. And after several delays due to the pandemic, Lipa is finally embarking on the worldwide Future Nostalgia Tour.
In the midst of what must already be an extremely busy string of months, Lipa has also managed to launch a new weekly newsletter, “Service95,” and her podcast “Dua Lipa: At Your Service.”
In both Instagram posts and interviews, Lipa has pointed to her love of lists as a key motivation for creating the newsletter. In the newsletter, these short “listicles” are written both by her and invited authors. So far, she has outlined her favorite London restaurants, tricks for overcoming insomnia, and book recommendations, while her guests have dished about everything from their favorite things to do on a day off in Paris to their favorite lingerie brands at the moment. Often including no explanation, the lists simply give a seductive glimpse into what makes a wealthy pop star and her close friends tick.
Placed between these lighthearted listicles are essays by a number of authors highlighting pressing social and political issues. These include a call on Russian legislators to better protect women and girls from domestic violence, an essay arguing for changes to the modern approach to feminism, and a discussion of the importance of making the world accessible to all people. Each piece is interesting, well-written, and well-argued — successfully balancing calls to action with opportunities to learn from qualified authors.
This balance of content is on brand for Lipa, who often encourages her nearly 80 million Instagram followers to take inspired action, as she frequently speaks out about issues relating to her identity as both a woman and the daughter of two Kosovan immigrants. Her ability to casually interweave this activism between glamorous shots of her donning yet another fantastic outfit beside the pool or performing at an awards show merits praise. In doing so, she makes space for all parts of herself to come through, on her own terms and her own platform.
But the issue with “Service95” is not the individual pieces themselves. Each standalone list or article is at the very least fine, if not great. However, the combination of silly lists and serious articles in a weekly email is jarring. While some lists clearly intend to indulge the privileged by highlighting businesses and activities that come with a high price of admission, the works of journalists making legitimate and often time-sensitive calls to action stand in opposition to these.
One can — as Lipa clearly does — value both. But randomly including a little bit of each in her newsletter, though certainly true to her brand, is at best a noble attempt to expose her wealthiest subscribers to global issues, and at worst utterly tone deaf. It is difficult to imagine anyone who takes these activist pieces to heart being able to immediately switch gears as they read a lighthearted listing of the top online jewelry brands of 2022 without feeling like something is amiss.
A similar issue plagues her “At Your Service” podcast. Her first two guests, Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of French fashion house Balmain, and bestselling American author Lisa Taddeo, are given ample space to tell their stories and thoughtfully answer Lipa’s questions. But even still, hearing Rousteing speak about his experiences of racism in the fashion industry or Taddeo discuss the true stories of the women who inspired her novel has a realness to it that, when transitioned at Lipa’s prompting into lists of their favorite West Village restaurants and similar topics, becomes unsettling.
Ideally, Lipa will continue to develop these platforms creatively and give the same, if not more, space to others to share their own thoughts and experiences. But while this random assortment of insights and tidbits may work well in a shorter form, like Instagram, this new era of content creation that Lipa is hoping to enter will demand an additional layer of planning. With more preparation, Lipa will hopefully alter her projects in ways that feel more sincere and intentional.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Joe Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 to the Supreme Court on Friday, paving the way for the first Black woman to sit on the bench.
If confirmed, Jackson would be the 11th Harvard College graduate and the 18th Harvard Law School graduate to sit on the Supreme Court, which currently includes four HLS alums. She would be the eighth justice to attend both the College and HLS.
Prior to serving as a Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals judge in 2021, Jackson served as a United States District Judge and as Vice Chair and commissioner on the United States Sentencing Commission. In addition to being the first Black woman to serve on the court, Jackson would be the first former public defender to sit on the bench if confirmed.
Jackson currently serves on the Harvard Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body. Experts say Jackson could face calls to recuse herself from a high-stakes affirmative action lawsuit the court is set to hear in the fall that challenges Harvard College’s race-conscious admissions process. Her six-year term on the board expires later this year.
Biden nominated the Harvard alumna in a speech at the White House Friday.
“It’s my honor to introduce to the country a daughter of former public school teachers, a proven consensus-builder, an accomplished lawyer, a distinguished jurist on one of the most prestigious courts,” he said. “My nominee for the United States Supreme Court is Judge Ketanji Jackson.”
Following Biden’s speech, Jackson said she hopes to inspire future generations of Americans if confirmed.
“If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed as the next associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, I can only hope that my life and career, my love of this country and the Constitution, and my commitment to upholding the rule of law and the sacred principles upon which this great nation was founded, will inspire future generations of Americans,” Jackson said.
Ivy League alumni dominate the Supreme Court. Of the bench’s nine current justices, only one, Amy Coney Barrett, attended law school at an institution other than Harvard or Yale.
If confirmed, Jackson would join three other Harvard Law School graduates on the bench: Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76 and Justices Elena Kagan and Neil M. Gorsuch. Retiring Justice Stephen G. Breyer also attended Harvard Law School.
Earlier this month, over 170 Black Harvard alumni penned a letter to the White House urging Biden to nominate Jackson to the Supreme Court.
Jackson’s nomination comes as the Court prepares to hear a slew of high-profile cases — including the admissions suit against Harvard seeking to strike down affirmative action in American higher education.
She will need all 50 Democratic votes in the Senate, and a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris for confirmation. Democratic leaders say they hope to confirm Jackson by the April 11 recess.
Correction: February 28, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 would be the first Black justice to sit on the United States Supreme Court. In fact, Jackson would be the first Black woman to serve on the court.
