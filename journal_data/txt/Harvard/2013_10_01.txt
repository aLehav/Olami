About midway through the action of Sony Pictures Animation’s new “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,” the main protagonist, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), has a brief exchange with another character that is strikingly indicative of the audience’s viewing experience.  “How is that even possible?” the character asks Flint as they make their way across the abandoned island from the first film, now inhabited by animal-food hybrids. Flint responds, “It’s best that we don’t think about it,” and he couldn’t be more right. “Cloudy 2” is definitely a film better appreciated the less it’s dissected. And to be fair, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. After all, it is a children’s movie, and though recent animated kids’ flicks such as “Wreck-It Ralph” have set a high standard of being able to entertain both children and the adults that bring them, “Cloudy 2” does a fine job of amusing its target audience despite a simple plot and even simpler humor.
The sequel, like the original, is based on the children’s picture book of the same name, though the relation seems to be in name only. Actually, “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2” has very little to do with food-themed weather, the basis of both its predecessor and the book. Instead, the movie picks up where the last one left off, after Flint’s food-weather-producing machine (the “Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator,” comically shortened to the unpronounceable acronym “FLDSMDFR”) triggers a food storm that forces the whole town to relocate. Soon thereafter, Flint is summoned by the famed scientist Chester V (Will Forte), who informs him that the “FLDSMDFR” is still acting up. This time, instead of just producing food-weather, the machine is spawning living food-animals that are learning to swim in order to travel to New York City and destroy the Statue of Liberty. Again, don’t think about it too much. So Flint springs into action, gathering together a rag-tag team of friends, family members and one very enthusiastic and very masculine local police officer, Earl Devereaux (Terry Crews). The rest of the movie chronicles the gang’s travels to the dangerous food island, their attempts to shut down the “FLDSMDFR,” their realization of the importance of friendship, and one heavily foreshadowed plot twist. It’s a plot that only a child could love, and thankfully for the audience, it’s pretty easy to ignore.
One thing that isn’t so easily overlooked is the amount of food puns employed by the film. Sometimes they’re downright groan-inducing, with lines like “cut the cheese” and “holy guacamole,” while at other times they’re indisputably clever. For example, a leek frequently appears aboard the characters’ ship, causing them to exclaim “there’s a leek in my boat!” When it isn’t dishing out the dinner puns, “Cloudy 2” goes straight for the admittedly funny physical and bathroom humor guaranteed to make any fifth grader keel over. Though the jokes don’t always land with the rest of the audience, when they do, it’s often because of the outstanding delivery by the voice actors. In particular, Officer Earl, a Mr. T-esque character who was actually voiced by Mr. T in the first film, will undoubtedly be one of the audience’s favorites, mostly due to a genuinely humorous voice performance by Crews. In addition to Crews, Bill Hader and Andy Samberg also please in their performances as Flint Lockwood and his bully-turned-friend, Brent McHale.
The voice actors are great, but it is the art direction of “Cloudy 2” that shines the brightest. The film creates an entire ecosystem composed exclusively of food. Among these food creations are crashing coconut milk waterfalls, towering cheese mountains, and most enjoyably, a whole host of food-animal hybrids. These often cute, always impressive “foodimals” populate the island and interact with Flint and his friends during their journey. The 3D viewing of the film only adds to the artistry of the island and largely avoids the items-flying-in-your-face gimmicks of many children’s 3D films. In one particular chase scene, the island is nothing short of breathtaking, with its creative foodimals and food landscape advancing toward and folding away from the viewer. In fact, the third dimension causes the island to bear a strong resemblance to a food-themed version of Pandora, the highly celebrated setting of James Cameron’s “Avatar.”
What “Cloudy 2” lacks in plot, depth, and sometimes writing, it often makes up for in artistry and likeability. Though it certainly doesn’t master the duality of maturity and lightheartedness exemplified by the likes of “Toy Story” and “Up,” it will almost certainly please the little ones, and that’s what it was made to do. Along the way, it throws in a quick lesson on the importance of being kind to friends and offers up some really imaginative imagery, a principal reason for the success of the original picture book.  By today’s standards especially, that’s not bad at all for a children’s film.

Do misbegotten metaphors make your hair stand on end? Are awkward sentences the stuff of your nightmares? Do you find unnecessary italics distracting? If so, Marisha Pessl’s new novel, “Night Film,” is not for you. The majority of this novel’s 587 pages brim with writing that is unabashedly bad. But in an unexpected and frankly perplexing twist, Pessl pairs shoddy prose with a hugely inventive plot, intriguing characters, and material that is downright fascinating. It’s a case of missing the trees for the forest: the question is not whether “Night Film” is a technically good book (it’s not), but whether you are willing to chuck your binoculars, step back, and enjoy the poorly constructed yet captivating spectacle.
Pessl’s chief achievement is her tortuous plot. Ashley Cordova, the 24-year-old daughter of legendary horror film director Stanislas Cordova, turns up dead in an abandoned warehouse. The incident is quickly ruled a suicide, but journalist Scott McGrath, whose previous attempt to expose Cordova as criminal has landed him in disgrace, decides to investigate. He quickly picks up a pair of sidekicks: Nora, a 19-year-old aspiring actress, and Hopper, a smoldering, 20-something drug dealer. Their quest to uncover the truth behind Ashley’s death takes them to a series of bizarre locales that includes a psychedelic Long Island drag club, the backroom of a “Witchcraft and Goddess Supply Store” called Enchantments, the mold and fan letter-infested penthouse of a washed-up actress, and finally to The Peak: Cordova’s terrifying estate in Upstate New York, dotted with secret tunnels, preserved sound stages, and the paraphernalia of backwoods pagan worship.
It’s nutty, mesmerizing material, and in spite of the novel’s considerable length, Pessl’s pacing is positively chipper. Readers are given little time to ruminate on the lunacy that has attended one investigative outing before a hairpin turn whisks them away to the next. There are, consequently, a lot of threads twisting their way through this book, but Pessl staves off impatience to arrive at answers by making the particulars of her mystery interesting unto themselves. Whether McGrath and Co. are soliciting advice from a witch doctor in Enchantments, or getting a lesson in Japanese mythology from a hulking tattoo artist, Pessl makes it clear that she did her research, dishing out a host of arcane, often frightening factoids. At Enchantments, witch doctor Cleo describes a substance called “goofer dust” as follows: “The H-bomb of spell materials…It comes from the Congo, the word kufwa, which means to die. The powder’s usually a yellowish color, but you mix in the graveyard dirt so it’s dark and can’t be spotted.” It’s the kind of trivia that’s bizarre enough to distract your attention from the fact that, close to 300 pages in, a conclusion regarding the mystery of Ashley’s death is nowhere in sight.
If only Pessl had seen fit to relay this information in the third person, rather than place Mr. McGrath at the helm. In spite of the best-sellers and writerly accolades Pessl plants in his home office, Scott McGrath seems to come from the same school of journalism as the fellow who covered the sinking of the Lusitania. His prose is characterized by facile one-liners, unimaginative descriptions, dubious metaphors, and italics galore. The character himself is not unlikeable. Droll and brooding, yet good with a capital G, McGrath has all the makings of a classic pulp hero. He just happens to be a terrible writer. Recounting his ruination at the hand of Cordova, McGrath would be hard-pressed to find a more hackneyed analogy: “I was down, knocked out, the fight over, a winner declared—before I’d even stepped fully into the ring.”
It is perhaps in order to compensate for McGrath’s inability to hold our attention via innovative prose that Pessl spangles “Night Film” with italics. Caught in a mildly frustrating situation, he whines, “Jesus Christ. Sartre really wasn’t kidding when he said Hell is other people.” Inveigled in a genuinely interesting situation, he reflects, “It was stupefying—not just that Hopper had broken in, but he was now trapped inside a personal residence of Cordova’s.” This is indeed an intriguing prospect, but McGrath’s compulsion to beat his reader over the head with just how intriguing is tiresome, and vaguely patronizing. A nadir of ludicrousness is achieved when Pessl attempts to utilize McGrath’s favorite heuristic in company with foreign words: “Ashley said she was inconosciente. Unconscious. But not from drugs. She called her una mujer de las sombras…No clue what that meant.” Was Ashley inconosciente, or merely “inconosciente”? The world may never know.
Groan-worthy moments also abound when McGrath delivers summaries of Cordova’s films. Usually, the substance of what McGrath is saying distracts from how dreadfully he is saying it, but Pessl appears to have something of a block when it comes to dreaming up fictional horror stories. Cordova is supposed to make Hitchcock look like Walt Disney, but the synopses Pessl offers up are laughably unpromising. In “Wait For Me Here,” the killer totes around an impenetrable box containing “the thing that had destroyed him as a child.” “Thumbscrew” revolves around one woman’s quest to ascertain the contents of her husband’s briefcase.
Pessl’s stellar plot is almost enough to make your forgive all this. And yet, like an amusement park built on quicksand, “Night Film” is doomed to fail by its foundation. Pessl weaves heavy themes through this novel. It is meant to evoke contemplation of the nature of evil, and the shadowy nature of the line that separates an artist from his art. But 600 pages with Scott McGrath are more likely leave you pondering whether a narrator with a taste for sensationalism is an acceptable excuse for bad writing (short answer: no). This is the rare book that fails expressly because it is a book—if “Night Film” were actually a film, it would be fantastic. Take that as a cue and wait for the movie.

There’s a scene in the musical biopic parody “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story,” where the movie’s fictional rock star protagonist is attempting to make the leap from pop sensation to artiste. He’s brought in a full orchestra and band into the studio to record his masterpiece, but he’s still not satisfied. “I want an army of didgeridoos!” he screams. “Fifty thousand didgeridoos!”
This is somewhat how I imagine producer Timbaland in the studio working with Justin Timberlake over the last few months. “I need an army of synthesizers and beatboxers!” he probably said while listening to playback of the track “True Blood.” “I want fifty thousand vamps! Fifty thousand backing vocal tracks! Fifty thousand animal noises!”
And so led to “The 20/20 Experience, Part II of II,” an album weighed down by misplaced ambition and excess. It’s not terrible, especially compared to other current pop albums, but it still feels like the half-baked leftovers of the excellent “Part I,” which came out in March. The two-part “20/20 Experience” was supposed to cement the Timber-duo’s status as timeless pop innovators, but this release instead shows that even the best run out of steam.
If Timbaland’s vague exoticism was on the verge of sounding tired on “Part I,” it’s exhausted by now. It seems he simply rehashed production snippets from across his career, modified them slightly, and mashed them together. When Timberlake summons the guitar on “True Blood” it enters, with the same figure it did on “Sexyback.” The heavy beatboxing groove on the opener “Gimme What I Don’t Know (I Want)” was swiped from the 2007 Nelly Furtado hit “Give It To Me,” and the jangling Indian tumbi used on Missy Elliott’s “Get Ur Freak On” was imported for “Murder.”
Worse than the recycling is the clutter. On “Part 1,” each instrument was distinguishable and noteworthy—just listen to “That Girl” to hear how clearly the slick bass and punctuated horn hits come through. Songs on “Part 2,” however, are largely overlong, jumbled washes of god knows what kind of instruments. “True Blood,” for example, clocks in at nine and a half minutes. Some of the discernable parts are: bongo-like drumming, ambient jungle noises, electro-whines, evil laughter, and truncated vocal snippets. It sounds like some kind of tribal sex nightmare.
“Drink You Away” tries even harder to be a genre amalgam. Its three-chord melody and lyrical content are country, its snare hits are pop, and its harmonies are R&B. What results is less an innovative blend than an identity crisis as organ flurries drift in and out without direction.
Timbaland’s production can be alluring when there’s musical or lyrical substance underneath. Unfortunately, there’s not too much to be found here in the way of melody or hooks. Too many of these songs are based on one-note melodies and forgettable choruses—come on, can you really do very much with the chorus lyric “T-K-O”? Timberlake’s lyrical regression certainly doesn’t help the cause. His nativity allusion on “Cabaret”—“I got you saying Jesus so much it’s like we’re laying in a manger”—is unfortunately the tip of the iceberg.
Every one of Timberlake’s solo releases has included both a classic jam and a classic ballad. “Part 2” unfortunately has neither. The best song on the album, “Take Back The Night,” is catchy enough—it’s driven by soulful horns, string flourishes, and a Michael Jackson bounce. But the stagnancy of the melody line and unoriginality mean that it’s less of a triumph in its own right than a resume padder; it’s the kind of song you might skip over on a Greatest Hits album in favor of “My Love,” “Mirrors,” or “Cry Me a River.”
It feels a little ungrateful to critique this album. After all, this is been our first year of musician JT since 2006, and we should cherish anything we get from him, lest he decides he’s an actor for the next seven years. But this album adds very little to his canon and even diminishes the greatness of “Part I.” “How did the sound get so amped up?” Timberlake asks on the blaring “Only When I Walk Away.” I’m not sure, but I wish he and Timbaland would turn it down.

"Cool Song No. 2"
MGMT, "MGMT"
Where have the cool “Kids” gone? With MGMT’s new album release comes their single, “Cool Song No. 2,” and a wave of disappointment as the band that brought “Electric Eel” to the music scene does not live up to its psychedelic rock standards.  As a tambourine-led percussion beat dies down to welcome the chorus, the louder voices and thrashing piano chords do little to add interest. If there is any silver lining of this subpar single, it’s that “Alien Days” and “Your Life is a Lie,” also from the new album, at least manage to  provide surging vocals that will keep you awake if not entertained.
"Applause"
Lady Gaga, "Art Pop"
Lady Gaga is at it again. With her newest single, “Applause,” Gaga does just as nearly every other pop artist does: focuses on none other than herself. Sung to Gaga’s usually electronic style, this is one dance-ready track you can feel free to miss. With lyrics such as “One second I’m a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me,” trying to find meaning in the words is futile. Little substance comes across beyond how the diva likes attention, and the tune is only as good as cold pizza: you’ll eat it when you’re starving, but you desperately hope never to be in that position.
"Don't Matter"
Kings of Leon, "Mechanical Bull"
It “don’t matter” if you listen for this song or not because soon enough you will be hearing it everywhere. From Kings of Leon’s new album “Mechanical Bull,” the dominance of popular summer hits “Supersoaker” and “Wait For Me,” still leave room for the up-and-coming “Don’t Matter.” As recently performed on the David Letterman show, this song with a strong rock feel features Caleb Followill’s somewhat raspy vocals and a strong guitar presence that brings a refreshing change to the mechanical trash that has come to define nearly all popular music these days.

Charlie’s Kitchen in Harvard Square isn’t the tamest scene. Juicy burgers and free-flowing beer contribute to a rowdy atmosphere. However, most nights at Charlie’s are probably not as chaotic as the time that Viva Viva played there live. In the middle of the set, the ceiling started falling apart. Stray electric wires popped out of the cracks, and the band was quickly asked to shut down the show. “We may or may not have broken things,” lead singer Vicini says slyly. “I figure people were just rocking too hard.”
Harvard Square, meet Viva Viva, a Boston rock band through and through. Though you hear fewer and fewer musicians these days professing their allegiance to the seemingly outdated genre, the members of Viva Viva proudly wear a rock 'n' roll ethos on their sleeves. There’s no pretense about it: Viva Viva revel in stomping grooves, gritty guitars, sweaty bars and basement shows.
They’re all about Boston pride, too. Most of the band members are from the area; two of them went to the Berklee School of Music. The band’s origins can be found in an apartment in Jamaica Plain, where Vicini and guitarist Chris Warren moved in together in 2005. They were both in bands at the time that were fueled by “tons of angst and distortion,” according to Warren, and found a kindred spirit between them that had been missing from their previous projects.
“I used to write my songs in one room, and he used to write his songs in another. One day, we were just like, ‘let’s meet up in the middle room,’” Warren says. The two clicked as friends and musicians, even to the detriment of previous relationships—Warren called in sick for a show with his own band in order to see Vicini play a gig.
Viva Viva formed shortly thereafter, playing their first gig at the Middle East. They soon dove onto the local circuit, playing at T.T. the Bear’s, Great Scott, and the Paradise Rock Club, to name a few. They even made a stop at Harvard, headlining the Mayfair Festival in the Square. “That was amazing,” says keyboardist Fumika Yamazaki-Burdett. “We love to come into Harvard.”
Among their constant gigging, the band gained a reputation for their raucous showmanship. When asked about performance details, the band members exchange knowing smiles and stay tight-lipped, only divulging that “there may have been some fights.” Their work ethic paid off, though; in 2011, they were named Best Rock Band at the Boston Music Awards.
Viva Viva’s music is hard-nosed and propulsive. “We’re not a retro band—it’s just good music, I’d like to think,” Vicini says. “We’re just doing what we like to hear.” Vicini grew up on the Kinks, the Velvet Underground, and of course, the Rolling Stones; the band’s devotion to the latter is made apparent by their musical viciousness and blues sensibilities, as well as their original song title “Sympathy for the Devil’s Little Helper.” That song is built on an insistent three-note guitar lick, while Warren and Vicini harmonize in the manner that Jagger and Richards did forty years ago. 
“Dead in Yr Tracks,” the band’s latest music video, is a near perfect representation of the band’s taste and style. A woman with a throwback floral print jacket grooves to the song on a vinyl player while Warren roams the Boston T and plays a bluesy riff on the downtown streets. Smoking, drinking, and dancing abound in a dark, jam-packed nightclub.
Nowadays, it seems that people are dancing and drinking more to hip-hop, pop, and dance music. The band acknowledges that rock as a genre is going through a tough period and that gimmicky showmanship has replaced craft. Still, Vicini admires the few rock bands who keep churning away, like the Black Keys or the Arctic Monkeys: “it’s better than hearing Limp Bizkit on the radio.”
 Vicini and company hope to join those bands on the national stage in representing a genre that is still very much alive and kicking. The band recently played at the Boston Calling music festival and is currently working on its second album, which is set to come out next year. Still, they make a point to always acknowledge their rowdy Boston beginnings. “When I was 13, I would drop off my tape with the bartender at the Middle East,” Vicini says. “Now, it’s our home.”

Sometimes “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” can be very difficult to watch. The show rarely holds back in its emotional heaviness: serial rapists, sociopathic criminals, and murders of children are common topics. And while it is entertaining to see how the investigations unfold, sometimes it does end up being truly disturbing. I’ve had one too many SVU nightmares after mistakenly watching it before falling asleep.
But in each and every episode, even in the most nail-biting moments, it is impossible to lose faith that justice will prevail because of the main heroine, Detective Olivia Benson. The other detectives also bring much to the table; Munch is shrewd and dedicated, Fin, played by Ice-T, is well…Ice-T. But it is Benson’s strength and passionate willpower that drive each episode. Elliot Stabler also had this quality of embodying courage and passion when he was on the show. But especially now that he is gone, Det. Benson is the reason that you feel safe by the time the mournful jazz music begins to signal the end of a particularly grueling episode.
This is perhaps the best explanation for why the season 15 two-hour episode premiere of “SVU” was so gut-wrenchingly distressing. Season 14 ended with Olivia Benson trapped in her apartment with William Lewis, a serial rapist-killer, holding a gun to her head before the screen went black. It was unclear to all if she would live—especially as it was unknown at first if Mariska Hargitay, who plays Benson, had re-signed her contract.
When season 15 picks up, we see Benson tortured, assaulted, trapped, and drugged at the hands of a heartless sociopath. While she does survive and breaks free (more on that later), the viewer has to watch for at least 40 minutes while she is abused verbally and physically. All at once, Benson, the protector and fighter for the weak, who makes each victim and us feel safe, becomes the victim herself. She is suddenly the one who needs saving.
As a viewer, seeing Olivia at the hands of an unmerciful rapist was a very powerful experience. By making her the victim, “SVU” turned the tables on its audience. Suddenly, Benson, normally the symbol of protection and safety, was trapped herself, leaving the viewer with nothing to do but watch, petrified, that it would be too late. “SVU” put the audience members in the role of the detectives scrambling to find her. Like them, we love Olivia and were thinking desperately the whole time of ways she could possibly escape.
Uncomfortable as it is to realize, it’s easier to watch “SVU” when each victim is a fresh character who you don’t know. It was much harder to watch the show when they tortured someone that I care about. This is perhaps an interesting reflection on how we all think about crime on a daily basis. We read a horrible story and feel pity, empathy, even disgust and then quickly move on. I can’t count the times I’ve read some horrifying story in the New York Post and shuddered at the evil of it. But by the time the day’s over, I’ve forgotten the name of the person killed. It’s very easy to just see a tragic situation as a “story” when we don’t know the people involved. We’ll be gripped by the shocking tale of Ariel Castro and yet not know much about the girls that he tortured. The newest episode of “SVU” forces us to process crime differently, putting viewers in the shoes of people that are directly impacted by crime and not just indifferent bystanders.
Of course, Benson does escape, and then she is left with a choice—she can kill Lewis or she can wait for the police to arrive. In the end, Lewis’ taunting becomes too much for her. She loses control and beats him with an iron rod, almost killing him. Reading the commentary on Hulu about this episode, I found that many viewers expressed that they thought Olivia’s choice at this moment showed she had gone to the dark side. On the contrary, I think it shows Benson is human and in the end a realistic character. It would’ve been very hard to believe that a dedicated sex-crimes detective, after being tortured and abused for four days, would have been able to rein in her fury at such a sadist. Benson’s behavior is of course not commendable—it would’ve been better if she had maintained control—but as her therapist tells her later, she is “not superwoman.” (Plus, can you imagine how much worse Lewis would’ve suffered if Stabler had been there?)
Benson is not perfect, but she is almost always noble and just. If she does ever die on the show, it will be as crushing a blow to the fictional fight for human good as the death of Albus Dumbledore in “Harry Potter” or Ned Stark in “Game of Thrones.” She is a reminder that real heroes can exist—people who constantly try to help others and yet at the end of the day, are human and susceptible to mistakes. In the end, it is Benson’s imperfect heroism that makes us all tune in at the end of the day to hear the “dun-dun, dun dun dun dun dun” music one more time.

This past Saturday, Mindy Kaling of “The Office” fame was featured on the cover of Parade Magazine. Wait for it, I haven’t gotten to the exciting part. Yes, she is one of the few female leads on television—as the creator and star of Fox’s “The Mindy Project”—and one of even fewer non-white leads. And yes, the magazine industry is notoriously reluctant to use non-white cover subjects. Even the gorgeous Halle Berry’s turn as a Cosmopolitan cover girl was described as an “improbable feat” by David Carr in the New York Times.
Despite this context, Kaling’s appearance on the cover was less surprising than what she had to say. When asked about the attention paid to her appearance, Kaling replied, “I always get asked, ‘Where do you get your confidence?’ I think people are well meaning, but it’s pretty insulting. Because what it means to me is, ‘You, Mindy Kaling, have all the trappings of a very marginalized person. You’re not skinny, you’re not white, you’re a woman. Why on earth would you feel like you’re worth anything?’” 
Kaling’s response to Parade’s line of questioning is understandable, and as she states later in the interview, the attention to what makes her different from the average TV heroine is not just “insulting” but distracting. “There are little Indian girls out there who look up to me, and I never want to belittle the honor of being an inspiration to them,” Kaling says in Parade. “But while I’m talking about why I’m so different, white male show runners get to talk about their art.” 
I’m not singling out Kaling’s statement because I think it’s rare for someone in television to want to be an artist more than a role model. I also don’t think it’s rare for a talented, attractive woman like Kaling to have a healthy sense of self-esteem. Judging from the name of her Fox series, I would say she is pretty proud of herself. But sentiments like Kaling’s are rare in an industry that is attempting to embrace more diversity but isn’t sure how to do so.
Kaling is aware that she doesn’t fit the television industry’s idea of what is attractive. This awareness even inspires a lot of “The Mindy Project’s” humor, since Mindy Lahiri—Kaling’s onscreen persona—hardly resembles the rom-com stars she envies. In one of the most priceless moments of the series, Mindy’s romantic morning with her boyfriend Josh is ruined after Josh accidentally wears her jeans and finds they are bit large on him. Mindy replies, horrified, “This is adorable. That is like a lap band surgery ad.” 
“The Mindy Project” may acknowledge that Mindy doesn’t fall into the Katherine Heigl mold, but it’s fitting since the series doesn’t aspire to cliche, formulaic romance either. Mindy Lahiri may be a sucker for romance, but she has studied the genre so extensively to avoid the typical ingenue’s naivete. When she realizes the man she is dating is secretly in love with his best friend, rather than breaking down or bemoaning her circumstances, she tells it to him straight: “I’m like the Joan Cusack character in the romantic comedy of your life.” Mindy dreams of finding her soul mate, but until she does, we can look forward to how Mindy comments on the ups and downs of her love life with wit and awareness. There is romance to be found on “The Mindy Project,” but it’s not airbrushed or saccharine as the movies it often references. After all, the series focuses on how Mindy keeps searching for her own Prince Charming in spite of setbacks, rather than how her life has failed to meet her romantic expectations. In keeping with this more realistic depiction of romance, “The Mindy Project” doesn’t fixate on how Mindy is different from most chick flick stars. Mindy may not be an expert at dating, but the series never blames her relationship problems on her figure.
Ultimately, the discrepancy between Mindy Kaling and most box office babes doesn’t demean Kaling but instead underscores her confidence.  In an episode of “The Mindy Project,” a handsome date tries to impress Lahiri by telling her about how he takes models to parties and she responds with, “Well, lucky for you, I was featured in my college admissions brochure holding a test tube. So I guess you have a thing for models.” Mindy Lahiri is a far cry from Gracie Hart, the homely CIA agent played by the stunning Sandra Bullock in “Miss Congeniality” and even further from the self-deprecating Liz Lemon. (If Tina Fey ate all the things Liz Lemon claims to, she would not be nearly as svelte as she is today.) One of the funniest moments of the series’ pilot is when Mindy Lahiri—who drowned her sorrows at her ex-boyfriend’s wedding—shouts “I’m Sandra Bullock!” while riding a bicycle drunk. Mindy Kaling may not be the typical starlet, but she isn’t pretending she is one either. The real and fictional Mindys both convey a genuine sense of confidence that might surprise magazines, but it is inspiring to see artists who not only display self-acceptance but don’t need to ask others for it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nicole Aquillano, a ceramic artist and former engineer from Fort Point, Mass., creates pieces of pottery inspired by the architecture around her. Using photographs of her favorite buildings, she copies the designs onto her work and fills them in with blue and clear glaze, creating a dripping effect that she feels gives the works a sense of nostalgia. After giving a talk at the Harvard Ceramics Studio on Thursday, Aquillano spoke about her work, her upcoming projects, and her recent transition from environmental engineer to full-time entrepreneurial ceramicist.
The Harvard Crimson: What first got you interested in ceramics?
Nicole Aquillano: In college, I was going to school for my degree in mathematics and civil engineering, and I had to take a liberal arts credit. So I took a clay class, and of course, I loved it and I spent all my free time in the studio. Then after that class my professor approached me and asked me if I was thinking about maybe taking the second-level clay class and encouraged me to do that, so I ended up taking a clay class every semester and getting a minor in art because I kind of knew that was what I really wanted to do.
THC: What gave you the idea to combine architecture with ceramics?
NA: I had always used architecture as my inspiration for my work, but going into grad school I was translating that into abstract patterns with lines and dots [and] a lot of repetitiveness, because you see that a lot in architecture. And then halfway through grad school I had a critique where someone told me to be more specific in what I was referencing, to try that out, and so I did.
THC: How do you achieve the dripping effect you utilize on many of your ceramics?
NA: It was kind of an experiment. I had some work [and] I didn’t really like how they’d turned out, so I threw them in a high fire glaze kiln. It was a mid-range glaze, [and] putting a mid range glaze in a high-fire kiln makes it run. But I really like how the clear [glaze] that I used pulled the color out from the drawing a little bit, and...kind of makes it look more like a memory or gives it a feeling of heaviness, or just seriousness.
THC: How do you decide what buildings or structures to draw?
NA: I like to use imagery that is important to me—that way it makes sense to me that I’m drawing it. Although I do a lot of custom work [too], which is really fun [because I] get to hear someone else’s story. But I tend to gravitate toward imagery from my surroundings. I live in Fort Point, so I use a lot of Fort Point imagery and places that have had a big impact on me. I use a lot of North End scenes…because really the North End was the whole reason I moved to Boston. I just fell in love with it—it was exactly like Italy. Like, how could I not move? I also draw my childhood home over and over again.
THC: Can you tell us anything about any future projects that youhave planned?
NA: I am doing a workshop in Brockway, Pa.…at the Brockway Center for Arts, and a show there too, in conjunction with the workshop…. [We also have] a really fun event in Fort Point on the 18th, 19th, and 20th of October. All the artists in Fort Point…open their doors to their studios and let the public come in and see what they’re working on and what they’ve made in the past couple months.

 The indie Robin Wright film “Adore” made waves (or at least mediocre splashes—33% on Rotten Tomatoes and a modest box office haul) when it hit theaters last month due in part to its controversial storyline involving two mothers who engage in carnal relations with each other’s sons. Despite our most sincere intentions to move out of an SNL-centric pop culture paradigm, we couldn’t help but recognize that the plot of the film was identical the Lonely Island and Justin Timberlake collaboration “Motherlover.” And so the Arts Blog presents our ideas for the most compelling hypothetical films based on other Lonely Island tracks.

“The Creep”
 
An intensely disturbing and surreal character study by David Lynch, “The Creep” explores three middle-aged brothers’ (Kyle MacLachlan, Bill Pullman, and Jackie Earle Haley) pervasive sexual ritualism. Seemingly successful small-town Michigan grocery store owners by day, the cousins engage in varied forms of peeping-tom voyeurism by night. As the brothers fall deeper into erotic obsession, they begin to be haunted by increasingly Dali-esque flashbacks (or flash-forwards?), which ostensibly trace the origins of their sexual deviance. As the line between reality and fantasy becomes blurred, the viewer is confronted with the possibility that all three brothers are in fact a single entity.
 
“Dick in A Box”
 
From acclaimed director Julian Schnabel comes “La Vierge dans la Zone” (American title: The Penis in the Enclosure), an inspiring and ultimately tragic true story of overcoming unthinkable odds to create timeless art. Starring the always-charismatic Olivier Martinez as Jean Voudin, a 1980s porn star who suffers a rare full-penis paralysis while on set, the film traces the construction of Voudin’s innovative splint and his improbable return to work. A polemic on the fleeting nature of fame, Schnabel’s newest work would attract major buzz after receiving a standing ovation out-of-competition at Cannes.
 
“Like A Boss"
 
A flashy corporate thriller from Steven Soderbergh set shortly before the 2008 financial collapse, “Like A Boss” stars a fast-talking George Clooney as the CEO of a massively successful international investment firm and Matt Bomer as a highly ambitious and charming analyst quickly making his way up the rungs of the company ladder. As Bomer’s character’s cocaine addiction, obsession with sexual encounters with both sexes, and suicidal thoughts derail his sense of self, he decides to send a series of anonymous letters to Clooney’s character detailing his dangerous lifestyle in an attempt to emotionally disturb him to an extent that his power structure might tumble.
 
“Threw it On the Ground”
 A mumblecore film from Joe Swanberg, “Threw it On the Ground” stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Orson, a bipolar San Francisco hipster who returns to Beverly Hills to attend the 60th birthday party of his estranged millionaire producer father (Jeff Daniels). Set in a single day, the film shows Orson’s expressing his contempt for L.A. vacuity in a series of scenes on the way to his father’s house. He wanders through downtown L.A and, in an especially revelatory episode, throws a borrowed cell-phone on the ground in a moment of frustration at the instant access to communication and information. Upon arriving at the party, Orson argues with two Hollywood actors over their egomaniacal lifestyles. He then gets into a contentious debate with his father over the implications of his excessively large cake and, out of spite, pushes it off the table. Gordon-Levitt is both heartbreaking and oddly lovable in the role, often spouting semi-coherent mantras about “not buying into the system.” Swanberg ultimately presents an all-too-realistic view of potential alienation in the iPhone age.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The question of how to revitalize struggling neighborhoods on a limited budget is among the great challenges of 21st-century urban planning. Today, Boston’s "gateway cities”—municipalities on the city’s fringe such as Brockton, Lawrence, and Lynn, many of which are reeling from the departure of manufacturing jobs—are seeking to generate civic engagement, improve urban livability, and make their streets safer.
These communities, as well as neighborhoods within Boston, are using public art initiatives and youth art education to engage their citizens and give their economies a boost. Such programs have managed to have an unmistakable impact of young people, even in the face of budget cuts and policy changes. Though not a panacea, arts programs have shown themselves to be an important part of a long-term economic strategy for urban renewal.
A CITY REBUILDS
The city of Lynn, Mass., is an industrial city located 10 miles north of Boston. Though once a thriving manufacturing town, the collapse of the shoe industry in the 1980s has had major repercussions for its economy, and Lynn’s violent crime rate is now significantly above the state average. Centerboard is a community organization based in Lynn that seeks to support the city's revitalization and believes the arts can help effect that change.
“Not only are we giving artists a chance to show their work and be supported, we're also giving community members the chance to see some high-quality artwork in their hometown," says Carla Scheri, Centerboard’s special projects coordinator. In addition to a public gallery which exhibits works by New England artists, Centerboard has installed a series of enlarged photos on the side of the Commuter Rail stop. “Much to our delight, the photos have never been touched or defaced, and I think that speaks volumes to the value that people are placing on this public art," Scheri says.
Among the arts projects run by Centerboard is a "traveling piano" which is moved to various places in the city to encourage people to gather. Two summers ago, Centerboard hauled the piano to a train station, where it attracted a crowd of 60 weary rush hour commuters to take a break and listen to some music, or even to play some themselves.
Due in part to the efforts of groups like Centerboard, Lynn has begun to turn a corner. Recently, the Massachusetts Cultural Council designated Lynn as a Cultural District, an honor that recognizes its blend of the arts and economic potential. Scheri sees a role for the arts in building the sense of community necessary for lasting economic progress. "When you have a strong local community, everybody wins. The youth win, the homeowners win, the business owners win."
HEALING BOSTON
In the late ’80s and early ’90s, Boston was hit by a historically unprecedented wave of gang violence, with many youth representing the perpetrators and the victims. In the wake of this tragedy, community groups like the nonprofit organization ZUMIX sought to use arts to prevent similar events in the future.
“We started with 24 youth[s], $200, and the idea of connecting the youth with the arts, in particular to music,” says ZUMIX program director Jenny M. Shulman. “These original programs were intended to involve youth in an open dialogue about societal issues like gang violence as an inspiration for original songwriting and public performance.”
Since its foundation, ZUMIX has expanded to serve 1000 kids a year under a $2 million operating budget. It hosts a number of community events, including a summer concert series, concerts in the firehouse, community dance nights, film screenings, and open mics. This season's ZUMIX programs teach youth to play and record music, produce their own radio stories, and learn the foundations of acting and stagecraft. In addition to its founding mission of giving troubled youth a space for open dialogue, ZUMIX has also had an economic effect—the organization's Z-Tech program teaches young people how to engineer audio, and some graduates go on to work as paid sound technicians at Boston-area concerts.
Despite the runaway success of the ZUMIX project, Shulman acknowledges that there were many factors at play in the revitalization of East Boston, which is now no longer the violent area it was when the group was founded in 1991. “There is definitely less crime, the neighborhood has been cleaned up a lot, and there have been many public projects that have improved quality of life,” she says, citing the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center and the refurbishment of Maverick Station. “We certainly couldn't take credit for the change.”
Looking ahead, ZUMIX, whose projects mostly take place outside of school hours, will have to tailor its programming to changing public school policies. “The biggest challenge is and continues to be extended school days because it cuts into after-school programming,” Shulman says, speaking of the currently heavily debated “Expanded Learning Time” initiative in Boston Public Schools, which would increase the length of the school year by at least 300 hours, cutting into students’ free time.  If the initiative passes, Shulman says ZUMIX will adapt. “We are hoping to spend more time working in schools or continue credit-earning programs where kids can fulfill their arts requirements through us.” Nevertheless, the longer school day may have an effect on ZUMIX’s enrollment and program structure.
Jean S. Whitney is the executive director of the Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family Foundation, which funds projects such as these. “These projects are not just focused on developing artistic form,” Whitney says. “They're also pulling in families and helping them to experience some of this art and give them higher aspirations for their kids. That's why we're interested in continuing to support these organizations.”
COMMUNITY ARTS GETS ELEMENTARY
Acrylic painting and papier-mâché may seem like childhood staples, but they are at risk of becoming a rarity due to budget cuts in Boston Public Schools. In the face of BPS art class funding cuts, some charitable groups are stepping in to fill the gap. Nicole Murray is director of the school partnership program at the Eliot School of Fine & Applied Arts. She also works on the Roslindale Arts Initiative, a project that works with eight public and charter schools to create a cohort of schools in the Roslindale neighborhood with extensive arts programming. The program, which is a partnership with the Eliot School of Art, started offering in-school and after-school programming in Boston Public Schools.
“Our goal would be for every school to have a full time Boston Teachers’ Union art teacher, but now with budget cuts and school funding being what they are, schools have made decisions that have made that impossible,” Murray says. “Our goal is to show schools the value of arts education so that at some point, in the future, they might hire their own art teachers. In the interim, we fill a gap.”
The Roslindale Initiative culminates in two public art exhibitions every year, one in June and one in November, where students, families, and communities can see student art displayed at the Roslindale Community Center. “Every art teacher has challenges—maybe they're the only art teacher in the building, or they don't have money for supplies...and [the exhibition] makes it a community that is more united through the arts. it makes it so teachers feel proud, parents feel proud, students feel proud, principals take note,” Murray says. “Families are struggling so not everybody comes, but enough come to demonstrate that people are excited about the arts.”
Murray says some clear markers of success from the program are already visible, such as starting a conversation about the need to fund the arts and getting students excited about classes. “We've had several students who were middle school kids who took our classes [for free]. The next year, we gave them a job working as a classroom aide in our program and they've gone on to Boston Arts Academy or to high school, really with the sense that they are an artist.”
According to Murray, the biggest impact is on children’s self-confidence. “The value of art as not another test is huge. It just makes kids happy. We see that again and again in our surveys. Especially when we hear from teachers that someone who is struggling in their classes is doing well in art class, that's a serious impact. And for that child—that's immeasurable. And that happens every day.”
GETTING THEIR ACT TOGETHER
Many clubs at Harvard, including CityStep and HARMONY, seek to enrich the lives of Boston’s youth through exposing them to dance, music, and art. The Student Theater Advancing Growth and Empowerment—or, as it's more commonly known, STAGE—is one such group that uses arts as a vehicle for social justice. STAGE’s after-school theater program addresses the same loss of arts funding that Murray speaks of. The program, which works with five schools in the Boston area—two of which are in Dorchester, an area with a reputation for crime—teaches young kids how to act and write their own plays, helping them to develop public-speaking skills and confidence.
On the group’s Campus Day in the spring, elementary students are invited to come to Harvard to work on their plays and sets. In May, the year of work culminates in a public performance for students from other schools, teachers, and the Harvard project team.
Erin A. Lotridge '15, STAGE co-president, says the program offers students a rare opportunity to join a structured extracurricular activity.
"[In the] second semester, the kids actually write a play themselves, and then they come to Harvard and perform it. Their parents come to Harvard to watch the plays and we all gather to watch the performance," she says. Many of the STAGE students come from low-income families with working parents for whom taking time out of the day to attend a performance can require sacrifice. Still, Lotridge says, many parents make the effort to drive over and support their children.
According to Lotridge, the program has a substantial effect on the young students it mentors. "It really does inspire their confidence and social skills. A lot of the after-school programs are homework-based, and even if they have other programs, they're not clubs, they're activities that vary day to day. STAGE is special because it's something structured that they get to do all year, and at the end they have this performance."
DOLLARS AND CENTS
In 2002, Richard Florida, former correspondent for TheAtlantic.com and current American urban studies theorist at the University of Toronto, published "The Rise of the Creative Class," a sociological study of what he termed the "creative class"—a category that includes not just artists but anyone who works with ideas and intellectual properties. His study sheds light on the ways that investing in the arts can lead to economic benefits through sales revenue, advertising profits, tourism, and job creation.
Florida claims that there are three factors that attract creative talent to a region: existing talent, technological innovation and the capacity for further technological growth, and cultural tolerance. Cities that position themselves as attractive places for artists along these three axes stand to benefit economically from the industry. “The economic benefits [creative clusters] provide are less direct, but nonetheless significant,” says Florida.
Though some had speculated that this trend was limited to pre-recession times of economic prosperity, in 2012, Florida updated the statistical analyses in his work and found that the increasing economic importance of creative clusters continues to be a reality supported by data.
Florida emphasizes that the arts are not a magic bullet for struggling communities and that a major university, hospital, or natural resource will have a more immediate effect on economic growth than an arts cluster. Still, he asserts the importance of the arts as an economic driver. “Creative clusters give rise to creative businesses—art galleries, clubs, performance spaces, publishers, recording studios,” Florida says. “That in turn attract[s] people who might not be culture workers themselves, but who are educated, aesthetically attuned, and very likely work in creative professions.”
All across Boston and the surrounding area, youth in programs like ZUMIX, the Roslindale Initiative, and STAGE take part in an art education system whose cumulative effect is to materially change their communities. For these kids, focused on producing a catchy new song, memorizing their parts in a play, or completing a painting assignment using materials more exciting than standard markers and crayons, the arts are a way to express themselves and work with peers. Focused on their individual projects, these students aren’t necessarily aware of the community-level effect of these initiatives—but they are unmistakably there. While art is not a universal cure for urban economic woes, it is an increasingly common part of comprehensive revitalization strategies. These initiatives hold that art has the power to engage youth, both intellectually and in the form of art-related jobs, and to be the spark for a creative economy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gruesome images of Biblical figures abutted vibrant paintings of flowers last Thursday at a reception at the gallery space of the Allston Education Portal, a joint partnership between Harvard, Boston, and the Allston-Brighton community that aims to foster learning and new educational experiences for residents of the neighborhood. The event celebrated an exhibition curated by the Unbound Visual Arts Committee  that opened at the Allston Education Portal on September 9. It consisted of the work of two painters with dramatically different styles.Heidi Lee, a teacher at the Boston Trinity Academy, is one of the two artists whose work is on display. Her brooding and intense paintings stand in stark contrast to fellow artist Diana Weiske’s paintings of bright poppies and beach scenes in the adjacent room, titled “Petals & Places.”
According to Lee, her exhibit, “Inner Journeys,” is an ode to the power of resilience and the paradoxes of the human soul. One of Lee’s central pieces, titled “Sacred Sinner 1,” consists of textured square canvases depicting a gruesome scene between Mary and Jesus in which Mary whips Jesus in front of a crowd of displeased onlookers. “This piece grapples with the potential of each human soul to possess great holiness and great evil at the same time,” Lee says.The paradox of the human soul that the artist describes is a consistent theme in her artwork. “Sacred Sinner 1” is the first of a collection of paintings addressing the corruption of the church. Lee says that her work is often a social commentary, but that she allows viewers to come to their own conclusions about her pieces. Many of the artist’s works include both recognizable and abstract elements for this reason. “
I want people to use their imagination to construct the abstract portions of my work,” she says. “That’s why I don’t give an artist statement for every piece. I think it takes away some of the imaginative quality.”Lee’s visual style complements her dark subject matter. She uses a subdued palette accented by bright reds and deep blues. Her paintings almost always have a distorted human figure present. She says the inspiration for these figures and her paintings come from what she likes to call “visual words”—collages that she creates using newspaper cutouts and lines of poetry.One of the pieces in the exhibit was shown in its intentionally unfinished state surrounded by the artist’s collages. John A. Quatrale, who curated the exhibit and came up with this unique display, says that he wanted to highlight Lee’s creative process.
“Sometimes galleries can seem too sterile, like the art is too perfect,” Quatrale says. “Many people walk away not knowing that art is a messy process.”Quatrale is one of 60 members on the board of Unbound Visual Arts. The board chooses artists every year for 20 exhibits. He says that the board’s concept behind this current exhibition, which is on display through November 3, was to underline the contrast between two artists.Walking from Lee’s exhibit to Weiske’s exhibit feels like passing into a different world. While Lee depicts shadowy images of abstract figures, Weiske favors sunny street scenes and bright poppies, which she has been painting for 15 years. Her exhibit was curated by Ruth Rieffanaugh, who is herself a Boston visual artist specializing in paintings and collages.Lee and Wieske’s creative processes are, not surprisingly, extremely different. Although Lee and Weiske have very different approaches to art, they both agree that risk-taking is important to the creative process. Weiske admits that she is most comfortable with bright colors and few people in her paintings, but she has experimented in the past with different palettes and drawing figures. Lee also sees a value in risk-taking.
“If we don’t take risks then we never learn,” Lee says. “I feel like I’ve learned more from my mistakes than my successes. That’s why I try so many different techniques.”
While both artists use oil as their medium, their styles are starkly different. Lee focuses more on dark images and recognizable figures from religion and popular culture; Wieske’s paintings are more impressionistic and vibrant. “I don’t do a lot of sketching or planning,” Weiske says. “I take a lot of pictures.” Weiske’s exhibit is inspired by her own travels and those of relatives. These influences are translated into a heightened reality of the brightest blues and reddest reds she uses in her works.  “I always think that I’m trying to get the colors as I see it, but they always turn out brighter than they actually are,” Weiske says. “I automatically make things brighter because I just love bright colors.” This exhibition is the first in the 2013-14 Unbound Visual Arts season. On November 9, the Unbound Visual Arts Committee will collaborate with Boston Open Studios, a community event in which artists display their work for a small fee in a variety of nearby venues. The exhibition is the latest in a series of EdPortal events that seek to encourage dialogue about art between Harvard and the communities that surround it.

“You start a conversation, you can’t even finish it. You’re talking a lot, but you’re not saying anything.”
David Byrne of the Talking Heads was not referring to freshman senator and Harvard Law School graduate Ted Cruz when he sang “Psycho Killer.” But the lyrics aren’t a bad fit for the 21-hour, 19-minute speech on the Affordable Care Act the Texas Republican gave last week.
Cruz’s faux-filibuster came in response to the House’s passage of a short-term spending measure that called for the defunding of President Obama’s signature health care legislation. Cruz’s stunt could not have prevented a vote on the continuing resolution (when he had finished speaking, the self-styled defender of conservatism himself joined in the 100-0 decision to end debate and proceed to a vote). As predicted, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid added an amendment removing the language that gutted the ACA.
The spotlight then turned back to the House, which passed another bill that would delay the health care law for a year, remove a tax on medical devices, and permit employers to opt out of contraception coverage. Some version of the budget had to be passed before midnight on Monday if the federal government was to avoid a shutdown. No such compromise was reached and as of press time the government was in shut down.
Cruz’s tactics—though perhaps a career boost for Cruz—were distinctly nonstrategic for the GOP. The Texan, ignoring the reality of constraints set by procedure and time, threw fellow Republicans under the bus, likening America with Obamacare to the Third Reich (and representatives who demonstrated any leniency towards the health care law to Hitler’s appeasers).
But rhetoric like Cruz’s serves only to divide the GOP from within; performances like these play into the hands of those who criticize the party as obstinate and impetuous.
Of course, the vast majority of Republicans support the senator’s objective of defunding Obamacare. It was his approach—his gunning for an effectively impossible outcome, a kind of celebration of the budget-health care impasse—that any reasonable person should have found off-putting.
What might the Republicans have done? They might have pushed for a one-year delay of the individual mandate, or the elimination of what’s been criticized as an unfair federal subsidy for lawmakers’ insurance. These demands would have forced Democrats into the uncomfortable position of defending the mandate on private citizens (when the mandate on businesses to provide insurance to employees has already been delayed for a year), as well as what some perceive to be a special Congressional “carve-out.”
Had these provisions been included in the temporary spending bill instead of a comprehensive defunding, Reid and the Democrats would still have rejected them; Republicans would have still faced a choice between a “clean” spending bill and a government shutdown. But we’d have encouraged the Republicans to exercise reason and restraint (just as we hope they will when they vote on the debt-ceiling). For a shutdown would be detrimental for the country and the GOP alike (a default, likely, calamitous).
If Republicans hope to be successful in repealing the ACA, they’ll need to win elections. Some, like Cruz, may have believed the ill-planned and ill-fated scheming of the last week was part of an effort to win the latest battle against the health care law. But we find it baffling that Republicans would sacrifice their war to win a battle.
As for Ted Cruz (to quote the Talking Heads once more): “[he is] vain and [he is] blind.” And, while we could go on—“say something once…why say it again?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Warning: The following article contains several large spoilers.
I’ve spent the past year convincing most of my family/friends/anyone I meet that Breaking Bad is the closest that television as a medium will ever come to Shakespeare. And yes, I received a lot of ambivalent stares, bewildered faces, and half-hearted nods. But I was convinced. “Just wait until the end,” I would say when met with any face that wasn’t enthusiastic agreement, “you’ll see what I mean.”
For those patient enough to hear my extended monologue, I would tell them that two of the central aspects of the show directly mirror Shakespearean tragedy: the structure of the show’s dramatic arc and the driving force of its main character’s personality.
After Sunday’s series finale, I still stand by my argument. Yet, in true Breaking Bad fashion, the complete sequence was much more complicated than any one could have guessed.
The structural parallels seemed relatively simple. Five seasons paralleled five acts, each of which propelled the story into a new chapter where destruction and tragedy appeared imminent. As others have pointed out, the show even operated its own clockwork universe that caused us to ignore, if not willingly accept, the stranger aspects of its plot. For a TV show, that singlehandedly made Breaking Bad revolutionary.
And then there was the character of Walter White, whose unbridled ambition and narcissism directly channeled the likes of King Lear, Macbeth, or Richard III. His ascension to the top of the criminal underworld and his complete transformation from mild chemistry teacher to ruthless murderer made Breaking Bad one of the best character studies to ever grace television screens.
It became clear a long time ago that Walter White would die. It was just a matter of how. The final episodes seemed to reaffirm my suspicions. All of Walt’s lies would come crashing down, his sins would be avenged, and everything that he built would evaporate. That moral arc and its karmic inevitability propelled the show. We may be sympathetic to Walter and repulsed by him in turn, but we knew that it would all eventually end. And we assumed that it would end badly.
In the hours following the finale, however, my news feed revealed a mixture of contentment and relief. Breaking Bad ended happily, as much as it could have anyway. Walt’s children will get his money. He destroyed the neo-Nazis that enslaved Jesse, killed Hank, and continued cooking his product. He even won a small victory over Elliot Schwartz, simultaneously emasculating and manipulating his incredibly wealthy former partner. It was not the tragedy that we had expected.
Yes, Walter White died. But he ended the show on his own terms, having defeated everyone around him and accomplishing his own goals. In this way, the finale resembled more of the show’s first episodes rather than the ones directly preceding it. Granted, he was not the same person who cried while having to strangle Crazy 8 (which is partly why Jesse being able to strangle Todd was so significant), but he was not Heisenberg either.
Like the beginning, Walter White was defeated by fate and, like the beginning, he became the underdog we could root for. The climax of the episode, a final moment of action-movie awesomeness in a series of action-movie awesomeness, resembled Walt’s confrontation with Tuco at the end of the first season rather than his confrontation with Gus Fring at the end of the fourth.
The reversion of Walt’s character to these initial episodes came from a significant break the show made with the typical protagonist in a tragedy. Character flaws are usually the protagonist’s undoing and the final act demonstrates the ways in which those flaws destroy the character.
For Walter White, that happened two episodes ago. The protagonist of the finale was someone who had already come to terms with his own flaws, who had accepted that he did everything for himself and not his family. His character traits had destroyed him, yes, but he would dictate how they destroyed him.
Walt’s agency in the finale changed the structure of the last two episodes and broke the Shakespearean expectations I had hoped for in the conclusion. And that may actually be one of the finale’s greatest strengths. It surprised all of the many predictions in the past few weeks and changed our expectations of what could possibly occur. It made us once again feel like we could sympathize with, or at the very least feel happy for, Walter White.
That would also explain the conflicting emotions and uneasiness that accompanied the finale. After all, there was very little focus on anyone but Walter White, whether his family or his victims (the closest we got was the satisfaction of Jesse finally breaking free).
In the end, we too were forced to accept the ending on Walt’s own terms. Like all tragedies, he was finally defeated but, in true Walter White fashion, he still got the last word.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This must be the sophomore slump,” I thought to myself as I sat, literally slumped, in a chair marked “free” on someone’s lawn in a neighborhood near the Quad.
The first few weeks of sophomore year have been great, but certain parts of it have definitely put me in a bit of a funk. The transition from the glamorous life of a socialite in the bustling metropolis of Harvard Square to a rugged cabin lifestyle in the rural Quad wilderness has been harder than expected. The consequences of treating shopping week like freshman week hit me in the form of a pile of catch-up work that I have yet to fully address. And, until very recently, I found myself absentmindedly lining up outside Annenberg for 12 o’clock lunch on a regular basis.
Other than schoolwork, I did two things of note last weekend. First, I went to a party sporting a sweatshirt, leggings, and my backpack. And second, I acquired a free chair from a stranger’s lawn. I should probably start acting more like a Harvard student and less like a wandering rogue. Sometimes, I long for the days when I cared about my appearance and the cleanliness of my furniture. But, for today, the unsophisticated and vaguely smelly nature of my weekend is one part of sophomore year about which I feel no need to be slumpy.
During most Friday and Saturday nights of freshman year, my friends and I would assemble some sort of plan to go out and see people at parties. Mascara and socially acceptable clothing would usually be part of the routine. This Friday, on our way back to our room after a wild night of p-setting and reading in the Currier dining hall, my roommates and I walked by a party and ran into some of our friends outside. After glancing down at my fuzzy socks and hesitating for a second, I looked at my roommates; we all agreed to enter the dark, drunk room.
The following afternoon, an upholstered chair and ottoman beckoned my roommates and me from the side of the street. And then, almost as if directed by fate, a middle aged woman walked by, stated her credentials as an interior designer, and told us that this was an invaluable piece of furniture we would treasure for the rest of our lives. For some reason, my roommates and I decided that it would be a great idea to take this chair from the side of the street, think about laundering its upholstery, and share it for the next three years. So, we delayed the return to our textbooks and spent the next  30 minutes staving off laughter as we hauled our new booty back to our dorm.
A good friend of mine once said that she loves it when people are “game”—willing to make spontaneous decisions and commit to unexpected things. It would have been easy to shoot out excuses about why it would not make sense for us to walk our messy buns and mascara-less eyes into a room full of cute guys, or why we didn’t have time to pick up a chair that would be unlikely to even fit in our suite. But, in both situations, we were game, willing to commit to something that provided no foreseeable benefit to us (no Gen Ed credit!), other than maybe a glimpse at good-looking boys and a piece of furniture for which we have no use.
So, my roommates and I, along with our heirloom chair, are embracing the sophomore slump. Personally, I am feeling pretty pleased about what is supposed to be the most unremarkable year of my college career. Because as much as life can be about putting one’s best foot forward at all times, it can also be about stepping one’s foot into a party even if there’s a fuzzy sock on it. Or walking one’s feet down the street with an ugly, useless chair.
I am certainly not advising everyone to pay as little attention to appearance and hygiene as I did this past weekend. After all, if freshman year is about trying to figure out how to do Harvard right, then sophomore year is about realizing that there is no “right” way to do Harvard. If we assume this postulate to be true, then it seems the key to success would be surrounding yourself with those who are game to do Harvard your way. At school, I rarely have a good-looking foot to put forward. I constantly wage battle against sleep deprivation, my addiction to HUDS “Funilla” froyo, and my ignorance as to when exactly “Harvard Time” does and does not apply. Add a group of girls with vagabond-like tendencies similar to mine, sprinkle in a healthy dose of peer pressure, and voila! I’m game for (almost) anything.
The word “sophomore” is a compound of the Greek words for “wise” and “moronic.” I find no oxymoron here. After all, it is wise to be a little moronic sometimes, and doses of stupid spontaneity are good for the soul. So, if you’re ever feeling sophomoric, why not go ahead and bushwhack your way to the Quad for dinner ? You know I would be game. And the best part? No mascara necessary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Exclusive organizations at Harvard are omnipresent, loud, and anxious to make themselves visible. If it is a day of the week that ends with y, chances are you will run into someone (or two people, or three) wearing a pullover with a giant Pegasus emblazoned across the front. And if it’s the weekend (no matter the time of day), you can probably expect to find the final clubs blaring music so loud that you can hear it across campus. But, despite their ostentatious self-presentation, the membership of these organizations actually comprises a very small percentage of the student body. Only about 15 percent of the student body is in final clubs, and all indications are that exclusive publications like the Advocate and the Lampoon—though statistics are unavailable—accept small numbers.
So with such a small part of the student body as members, why do we pay these groups so much attention?
As for the publications, the Lampoon doesn’t actually produce a humor magazine, and in my experience the Advocate is not widely read on campus. I would argue that the reputations these organizations have for exclusivity precede their content. We know about them simply because they want to make themselves known as something desirable solely for its unreachability.
Final clubs run along the same lines, except they don’t even have magazines to point to as their nominal purpose. Being chosen for a final club is not an indicator of skill or ability. It simply means that the person in question was able to perform “cultured” and “wealthy” well enough that a group of—on the large part—vastly privileged people decided they were worthy of being in their exclusive friend group.
We live in a society where money privilege (and other kinds of class privilege) is seen as a large indicator of worth. We are taught to be ashamed of poverty, ashamed of not knowing certain words, ashamed of having certain accents, and ashamed of not having had access to certain kinds of experiences.
Part of the draw of the clubs comes from the fact that they’re seen as an almost reachable form of money privilege, since acceptance into one of them is seen as improbable but not impossible. And the not-impossibility tells us that maybe if we are friendly enough, or meet enough of the right people, we’ll be able to get in! But this is largely an illusion.  Yet, as long as it is seen as a possibility, not getting punched (or getting punched and not being accepted) seems like a failure, an indication that you’ve done something wrong: not been socially likeable enough, not dressed nicely enough, not talked well enough.
But no one has the right to determine your adequacy based upon these factors. No one. Just because certain fellow students were raised with certain kinds of arts training, in certain linguistic registers, with certain kinds of social capital that taught them how to tell the difference between an oyster fork and a non-oyster fork does not mean that these people are in any way above you. It does not mean that they have the right to assess you, and it does not mean that you should feel at all indebted to them. Whether you were punched, or not, whether you know people in these clubs, or not, says exactly zero about your worth, potential and future.
By choosing to punch, you are reinforcing and legitimizing this system of shame, where people are made to feel inadequate and ashamed solely by dint of being poor, of color, queer, or a whole host of other things that don’t fit with the socially reinforced norm of being a wealthy white straight man. This is a system that exists to make clear that some are wealthy and some are not, some learned to talk a certain way at Dalton and some did not, and to make even more spatial and entrenched the socioeconomic inequalities in our school. This is a system that gives only men full access to eight of the most prime pieces of real estate on campus, and a system that has historically marginalized LGBTQ folk and people of color.
But the second we are able to collectively convince ourselves that being able to perform “wealthy” and cultured” are not necessarily things we want to be aiming toward, and that getting to be a part of something solely because another is excluded, is not in and of itself an appealing thing and, instead, unappealing in its inadequacy-making nature, we are closer to stripping these groups of a lot of their power. We need a sea change, and that will only come as the sum of small acts of resistance.
So if you were punched, don’t punch. Choose against punch because you respect your fellow students and want to see a community where people are valued, instead of constantly judged because of their ethnicity, sexuality, and (lack of) wealth.
And if you weren’t punched by a club, congratulations! You aren’t any worse off by not being a part of one. You are a Harvard student, and you have the world, in all of its infinite iterations, at your fingertips.

Advocating For Activism
Let’s face it: Harvard University dismisses even the faintest murmur of student activism. As activists at Harvard, we have experienced this first hand. But the Undergraduate Council has been one of the most supportive bodies for student activism on campus, devoting resources and energy to student interests. Denouncing the Undergraduate Council is callous and counterproductive.
Over the last two semesters, UC President Tara Raghuveer and Vice President Jen Zhu have dedicated themselves unconditionally to supporting and magnifying student voice on campus. The UC has maintained students’ faith that we can change Harvard for the better, and for this they deserve our support and gratitude.
Tara and Jen have served as invaluable advisors to and advocates for both Divest Harvard and the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition. They were the calming voice of support during the Boston Marathon tragedy and its aftermath. They were instrumental last spring in giving students space to channel their concerns about mental health issues on campus.
Without students like Tara, Jen, and all UC representatives who we rely on to speak up for the student body, Harvard is a brand and a $32.7 billion endowment managed by bureaucrats. Instead of grumbling about the well-intended work of our fellow students on the UC, all students should come together and demand that our voices be heard by our university.

The UC Matters
Have you ever studied in Lamont past midnight? Swiped into a House other than your own? Grabbed lunch at Flyby? Received funding for a student-organized event? As routine as these conveniences all seem today, they exist thanks to the steadfast efforts of past UC representatives.
Depicting the institution as “irrelevant” ignores its many vital functions and important successes, especially in recent years. We distribute over $500,000 in student group grants annually. It was the UC that brought 24/7 Lamont Library hours, as well as the student-run Lamont Cafe in 2006. Major UC advocacy and a student referendum in 2007 led to substantial reform of the academic calendar, including final exams before rather than after winter break. Harvard’s Secondary Field in Ethnic Studies was borne out of a campaign spearheaded by the UC and a cross-campus coalition. Our long-standing push for an undergraduate student center helped secure a major donation for its development. Just this Tuesday, the UC and Office of Student Life announced the long-desired return of weekend morning shuttles. With all this in mind, a more fair statement would be: “The recent advocacy efforts and their subsequent results demonstrate that the UC is very relevant on campus.”
We also respectfully disagree with the claim that elections indicate some kind of UC “irrelevance.” The fact remains that, in the majority of Houses, representative races were competitive and characterized by substantial campaigning. It should be expected that House elections are less competitive than their Yard counterparts, since upperclassmen tend to be more heavily involved in prior commitments. That a few candidacies were left undeclared should not overshadow the UC’s numerous accomplishments in the past year alone.
To end on a broader note, we urge the Crimson staff and readers alike not to let the arduous, long-term nature of our work give way to cynicism or disillusionment about the UC. Ultimately, when it comes to advocating for change at an institution as historic as Harvard, we must accept that progress is gradual but achievable. Now more than ever, the UC matters.

Against Conventional Wisdom
I am a junior, and I ran for UC for the first time this fall and was elected to represent Mather. That’s not supposed to happen. The conventional wisdom is that as upperclassmen, we are supposed to become jaded and disillusioned with the UC, and we are supposed to dismiss it as an irrelevant institution that is not worth our time or attention. So as a junior, why did I run for the UC for the first time? Because I still believe in the UC, and I think it’s about time that we rethink this conventional wisdom.
As each semester wears on, it is easy for everyone to hunker down into his or her own world of schoolwork and extracurricular commitments. But I think that the UC as an institution gives us a chance to step back from the hustle and bustle of everyday school life, reflect, and think about what we can do together as a student body. At the heart of the UC is a commitment to service, and service is about being part of something that is bigger than you and will outlast you.
I still believe that the UC has the capacity to bring together the student body in meaningful ways to achieve big picture changes. These big picture changes take time, but just because their impacts will be felt well into the future do not mean that we should not start right now. If you witness a problem such as low voter turnout at UC elections, the solution is not to continue not voting, but to take the initiative to vote and encourage your friends to do the same. If you think that the UC is not addressing the issues that you want it to address, then the solution is not to dismiss the UC as irrelevant, but to take the initiative to join the conversation.
There is so much excitement around the University right now about how we can reimagine the Harvard undergraduate experience. Now is not the time to sit on the side-lines and wait. The four years we spend here at Harvard are such a special time in our lives, and the UC can play a critical role in empowering students and giving students a sense of agency in shaping their undergraduate experience. I have a hunch that we will all be amazed by how much we can accomplish together when we genuinely listen to one another. That’s why I still believe in the UC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent book written by Ben A. Urwand, a junior fellow at the University, and published by Harvard University Press elicited a storm of contention within the past week on its claims about Hollywood and Hitler.
Urwand, who is in the last year of his fellowship with the Society of Fellows, has been criticized for making unsubstantiated claims that Hollywood film studios actively colluded with the Nazis to promote propaganda.
In addition to attacking Urwand’s book, “The Collaboration: Hollywood’s Pact with Hitler,” critics have questioned Harvard University Press’s review process.
In a blog post, New Yorker critic David Denby called Urwand’s work “recklessly misleading” and expressed his surprise that “Harvard University Press could have published anything as poorly argued as Urwand’s book.”
Urwand and representatives of Harvard University Press did not return emails from The Crimson, but a statement on the Press website defended the organization’s peer review process, stating, “We stand by the integrity of our refereeing and editorial procedures…[We] take very seriously the imprimatur of the University’s name.” The website also stated that five scholars engaged in a “rigorous review process.”
The word collaboration was a focal point of debate, according to Urwand.
“Collaboration is a word that had been used from the very beginning,” Urwand said in a video interview on the Press website. “The studios worked with the Nazis on the movies, which were screened all around the world all the way through the 1930s.”
Thomas Doherty, film professor at Brandeis University and author of “Hollywood and Hitler: 1933-1939,” pushed back against Urwand’s characterization of Hollywood as collaborating with the Nazis.
“The word collaboration evokes an active alliance with the Nazis in World War II. It’s totally out of line with how Hollywood did business in the 1930s,” Doherty said.
He added that Hollywood’s goal in the 1930s was  “100 percent acceptability. They didn’t want to alienate any customer no matter if you were a KKK member or a communist they didn’t want to offend you.”
The overall content and historical methods of the book, which allege that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  financed the production of German armaments before World War II began, have also been subjects of controversy.
James L. Hoberman, a Harvard visiting professor of visual and environmental studies who is currently working on his own review of Urwand’s and Doherty’s books, also objected to Urwand’s characterization of the period.
“I found his characterization of Hollywood to be extremely monolithic,” Hoberman said. “He seemed surprisingly insensitive to the cultural climate in the United States in the 1930s.”
Yet, Hoberman found strength in Urwand’s research.
 “I found the material from the German archives—the censorship discussions, the reviews that movies got in German press, Hitler’s personal taste—this was all very interesting to me,” Hoberman said. “It was not something that I was aware of as someone who knows something about the period and the issues.”

A packed audience filled Science Center Hall C on Monday, passing around samples of spherical gelatinized spinach during a public lecture entitled “Diffusion and Spherification.” The lecture was the fourth in a series associated with the popular course Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science.”
 
Ever since the inception of the series four years ago, the public lectures have been drawing crowds. This year was no different, with a line forming more than two hours before the start of the event. The immense popularity of the series came as a surprise to the course’s instructors.
 
“Years ago, we had our lecture at Jefferson 250. We had set the lecture for 6:30 but by 4:30, the room was packed, and we had to deal with overflow,” said applied mathematics professor and course instructor Michael P. Brenner.
 
According to Brenner, one of the main aims of the lecture series is to shed light on the culinary process by using fantasy foods to illuminate scientific processes that are important in everyday life.
 
The lecture was intertwined with videos and live preparations of spherical mojitos and round yogurt.
 
The speaker, award-winning, Spanish chef José Andrés, shared his take on the history of gelatin and treated the audience to amusing quips. Andrés has presented every year since the public lectures began.
 
“I could do presentations like this every other day. I love this one for a different reason. At Harvard, you can make it very serious, and you can make it funny,” Andrés said.
 
Andrés presented a video showcasing clips of his trips to Haiti, which he took to explore the country’s culinary riches as well as its culture and history. He encouraged the audience to travel to the country and “not to give Haiti pity but...respect.”
 
In an interview after the event, Andrés shared a list of recommendations for foodies in the Boston area, which included Salts in Central Square, Toro in South End, and Drink in South Boston.
 
Along with Ferran Adrià of the famous Spanish restaurant elBulli, Andrés plays an active role in recruiting chefs for the series. Joanne Chang ’91 of Flour Bakery and Ted Russin from the Culinary Institute of America will be featured in upcoming lectures.
 
The lecture series will continue every Monday at 7 p.m. until Dec. 9.

Amidst a backdrop of national unease regarding the fiscal drama playing out in Washington, D.C., Cambridge City Council announced a free cash balance of slightly over $142 million in this year’s budget, a triple-A bond rating, and the minimizing of residential tax rates at Monday’s meeting.
 
The atmosphere in City Hall was a happy and congratulatory one with City Council members praising City Manager Richard C. Rossi for his team’s stewardship of the city budget. Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, chair of the finance committee, noted that Cambridge citizens will directly benefit from this advantageous financial position.
 
“This is the ninth year in the row that 75 percent of residents can expect a tax increase of less than $100,” Decker said.
 
Rossi said that this year’s unusual budget surplus was due in large part to the relatively small quantity of health insurance claims filed, “the lowest [the City Manager’s office] could remember.”
 
But the tone of discussion at the meeting shifted to one of caution when Councillor Leland Cheung emphasized the misleading nature of the term “free cash.”
 
“It is not free. It came from the taxpayer,” Cheung said, adding that the money is effectively the City’s “insurance policy against disaster.” Cheung said that he instead preferred the term “unencumbered fund”—a phrase which caught on at the meeting.
 
City Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 also stressed the necessary role of the funds in financing upcoming projects such as public school building renovations, given the highly unlikely status of state and federal funding.
 
Terrence F. Smith, director of government affairs at the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce, urged the City Council to adopt the city manager’s tax rate recommendations in the public hearing.
 
“On the behalf of my members, I thank the City Council and the administration for providing an excellent service while keeping taxes reasonable for residents and businesses,” Smith said. 
 
Not all citizens were unabashedly positive about the city manager’s tax rate recommendation. Despite being satisfied with “the rosy financial situation,” Cambridge citizen Gerald Bergman said, “I’m going to say maybe the be-all-end-all for our moral and civic responsibilities is not the lowest possible tax rate, but how we meet the human needs of our residents.”
 
Bergman continued his critique by highlighting that MIT and Cambridge’s top ten real estate developers would be big beneficiaries of the $11 million in free cash if the City Council approved to lower the tax rate even further—not early childhood education and affordable housing. 
 
The City Council also approved policy orders concerning the quality and long-term care of inclusionary zoning units and continued debate on the issue of elementary school classrooms.

Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison and officers from the Cambridge Police Department and the Harvard University Police Department descended on the Harvard party scene Saturday night, responding to complaints regarding a number of final clubs, including the Owl and the Spee.
At one point, 19 officers from HUPD and CPD were gathered outside of the Owl, where one member of the male final club and and a student from another school were arrested for violating open-container laws, according to a CPD police report.
According to the report, two CPD officers requested to enter the club after receiving several noise complaints, but two males resisted the officers’ demand. Following this, CPD notified Ellison, who later arrived at the scene.
The police report cited the “numerous calls for service, the active disturbance, lack of cooperation from the individuals in the club, and blatant disrespect of students and patrons of the party” as the reason for informing Ellison of the disturbance.
HUPD was also present at the Spee Saturday night, according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
The presidents of the Spee and Owl Clubs declined to comment.
According the police report, Cambridge police responded three times to noise complaints over the course of Saturday night regarding the Owl Club, which was hosting its annual “Jersey Party.”
At the scene of the “Jersey Party,” one of the Owl’s larger events of the year, Cambridge police reported seeing “8 kegs in plain view” at the rear of the building, and partygoers at such a level of intoxication that it would have been “difficult and time consuming” for first responders to provide assistance during an emergency.
The police responded to a number of complaints regarding the Owl beginning at 10:36 p.m. on Saturday and ending at 12:13 a.m. on Sunday. CPD’s final response came after HUPD explicitly requested assistance, according to the police report.
An Owl member present at the party characterized the police response as normal for a weekend night up until the final complaint.
Officers arrested a member of the Owl for possession of alcohol and violating open-container laws by drinking in a public area after he had exited the club, according to the police report. Shortly thereafter, CPD also arrested a non-Harvard student for drinking in public out of a red Solo cup.
After the arrests occurred, more police arrived at the scene, bringing the total number of officers at the scene to 19—14 from CPD and 5 from HUPD.
Ellison wrote in an email to The Crimson Monday afternoon that he arrived at the scene only after the arrests were carried out and was asked to speak to the party organizers.
“By the time I arrived, the party was already shutting down,” Ellison wrote. “I was able to talk to the club leadership about the appropriate ways to respond to police requests and the serious consequences of failing to respond appropriately.”
In a phone interview with The Crimson Monday evening, Ellison said that officers typically ask tutors and proctors to help with disturbances at in-house parties, but because this was a college-wide event where students from a variety of Houses were present, the police decided to call Ellison.
After Ellison’s arrival, the Owl member said, club members talked to the police while partygoers slowly dispersed.
“I wasn’t called in to break up the party, the police were doing that. I was just asked to interact with students,” Ellison said by phone. “I was also there to help [the police] to avoid conflict and prevent things from escalating.”
Ellison wrote in the email to The Crimson that he also responded to another final club immediately after the incident, though he declined to identify which club.
According to the Owl member, Ellison has come to parties in the past that were being shut down and talked to members of the Owl’s board afterwards.
The Owl member added that he thought there was nothing unusual about Saturday night’s party other than its large size and high level of noise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 1, 2013 at 10:45 p.m.
As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences continues to chart tight budgets in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and his lieutenants are looking to the Harvard Campaign, the University’s first capital campaign since 1999, for financial relief, according to the Dean’s Annual Report for academic year 2012-2013.
The report was presented to faculty at their first meeting of the year Tuesday afternoon and is scheduled to be released to the public Friday.
Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 reported a budgetary shortfall of $3.7 million for FY 2013 in FAS’s “unrestricted core operations”--those funds available to Smith for FAS’s strategic initiatives and day-to-day activities. She characterized the figure as “a very modest deficit.” FAS’s total budget for the fiscal year, according to the report, was approximately $1.2 billion.
Also in the report, Kirwan wrote that FAS’s portfolio of long-term investments jumped six percent from last year, to $14.3 billion from $13.5 billion. Even so, Kirwan pointed out that the portfolio had not yet recovered to its pre-recession peak of $16.6 billion.
Both Kirwan and Smith wrote that FAS’s financial situation is “precarious” and that, to keep from running large deficits, FAS has had to dip into its reserves at an “unsustainable” rate.
“The budgetary balance we have achieved together is a huge accomplishment, but our financial situation remains precarious given the nation’s and world’s unstable environment,” Smith wrote in the report.
At the height of the global economic crisis in the fall of 2008 and the spring of 2009, Smith instituted a hiring freeze and across-the-board budget cuts to help remedy a projected two-year budgetary shortfall of $220 million. But years of careful guidance have allowed FAS to largely avoid projected deficits, and in FY 2012 the school managed to balance its budget for the first time since the financial crisis.
Yet Smith and Kirwan lamented that years of conservative budgets, while necessary to remain fiscally secure, forced unwelcome tradeoffs within FAS.
“This year we were able to cover our core expenses, but this same budget provided very little in flexible funds with which we could invest in the many priority needs of our faculty and students,” Smith wrote in the report.
Kirwan and Smith wrote that as a result of the budgetary difficulties, FAS will rely on support from the Harvard Campaign, which was launched in September and is the University’s first major fundraising drive since 1999. Smith said at Tuesday afternoon’s Faculty Meeting that the FAS portion of the Harvard Campaign will launch on Oct. 25 and 26. Identified priorities for FAS mirror those specified by the University and include Financial Aid, House Renewal and the Student Experience, Leading in Learning, Faculty and the Scholarly Enterprise, SEAS, and the Dean’s Leadership Fund.
“In response, we have constructed the Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences to support directly our academic priorities and to help offset our financial pressures.”
Kirwan wrote that this forward thinking, combined with the planning and priority-setting that FAS has undertaken in preparation for the Harvard Campaign, will encourage the campaign’s positive impact.
“The planning and preparation we have done during this period will ensure the Harvard Capital Campaign—while not a panacea—will directly address both academic priorities and financial pressures in the FAS,” she wrote.
The annual report, which runs 88 pages, covers a number of major trends and themes from within FAS over the last year, including faculty diversity and tenure and promotion practices. The document includes detailed reports from each of FAS’s major academic divisions, as well as the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Division of Continuing Education, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
While the overall size of the faculty stayed virtually the same in FY 2013, at 711 active ladder faculty members, the report notes that FAS conducted 73 tenured or tenure-track searches in the past year, the highest number since the financial crisis. 46 job offers were extended in total—21 to women and 15 to minorities. Of those offers, 28 candidates accepted, nine declined, and the statuses of another nine are classified as pending.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 3, 2013, at 6:11 a.m.
An armed robbery occurred at knifepoint on Garden Street along Cambridge Common Monday evening, according to a community advisory issued by the Harvard University Police Department Tuesday afternoon.
At 8:25 p.m. Monday, the male victim, who is reported as not affiliated with the University, was approached by a male who drew a knife, placed it against the victim’s throat, and demanded his property. When the man resisted, two other males approached and began to punch and kick the victim, the advisory stated.
After this occurred, the victim fled from his attackers and called the Cambridge Police Department. He was not “seriously injured,” according to the advisory.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Daniel M. Riviello, spokesperson for the CPD, wrote that “after the robbery in the Common, CPD responded and identified a group of several individuals nearby who may have been involved.”
The victim did not want to participate in a “show-up” with the identified individuals—in which he would have to confirm whether or not they were his aggressors—so CPD will continue to investigate the case, Riviello wrote.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email that HUPD has increased the amount of patrols in Harvard Square in response to the incident.
The advisory was the second community advisory to be issued in the past four days, the first having announced the assault of three women in Cambridge last Saturday. HUPD also increased its patrols in the Square after that incident.
A Harvard alert was also released by HUPD last Saturday regarding the stabbing in JFK Park.
 
According to Riviello, both of those cases will continue to be investigated, the stabbing by the Massachusetts State Police and the assaults by CPD. Riviello wrote that CPD does not believe this latest robbery or the stabbing in JFK are related to the “two women who were robbed of their cell phones last week.”
Since the armed robbery did not occur on University property, HUPD has advised anyone with information about the case to contact CPD.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Timothy M. Yang, a postdoctoral fellow in Harvard’s Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, examined the influence of private drug companies on the Japanese colonial sphere during the interwar period in a talk on Tuesday afternoon at the Center for Government and International Studies.
“The general question of medicine today in the global economy and in the world of the 19th and 20th century is really important, and I think he’s doing interesting work,” said History professor Andrew D. Gordon ’75 in an interview before the event.
Yang painted a picture of Japan’s imperial expansion through economic means and the consolidation of the Japanese Empire through public medicine by focusing on one case study: Hoshi Pharmaceuticals and its dealings in the quinine market.
The presentation shed light on three main themes: the role of relationships between public and private interests, the impact of global influences on local issues, and the Japanese Empire’s self-sufficiency. Ultimately, Yang argued that Hoshi served as a prime historical case in examining globalization today.
Yang, whose dissertation focused on the company, is officially a modern Japanese historian, but also has knowledge of Chinese and Taiwanese history, calling himself a “Transnational Historian of East Asia.”
For his dissertation, Yang mainly researched in Japan at the Hoshi University Archive, but also travelled to Taiwan and China. In an interview after the event, he said that his work is relevant to modern globalization, which he calls “one of the buzzwords of today.”
Globalization, he emphasized, is not just a phenomenon of the past: “like any other multinational firm, [Hoshi] has issues and global reach through a global network.”
Yang said his goal is to complete a manuscript by the end of the year and turn his dissertation into a book. After his fellowship, he said he will serve as an Assistant Professor at Pacific University in Oregon and is tentatively considering pursuing a project about Japanese and Chinese immigration to the West Coast of the United States.
According to Gordon, the purpose of Harvard’s program on U.S.-Japan relations is to bring together “a mixture of scholars and practitioners…to learn about social science, to learn about issues they deal with in their professional life back in Japan, [and] to interact with our students.”
“It’s a great benefit to our students because a lot of these organizations host our students as interns, so there’s kind of a reciprocal relationship that’s developed after the last 30 or 40 years,” he said.
Yang also had kind words for Harvard’s  U.S.-Japan program.
“It’s a great opportunity for people like me—who are academics—to have the time and space to research at a university like Harvard, which has the best resources in the world on almost anything related to East Asia and probably the best university library system in the world,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After sending his highlight tape to 252 schools, senior safety Jaron Wilson was not expecting a call from Harvard defensive coordinator Scott Larkee during his senior year of high school to let him know that the Crimson were “going to take a shot” on him.
“They weren’t quite sure they wanted to take a chance on me, but thankfully they did,” said Wilson, whose second quarter interception helped turn the tide in Harvard fooball team’s 41-23 victory over Brown on Saturday night. “That call was unbelievable. The type of call that brings tears to your eyes and you know it’s going to be a life changer. And it has been.”
After the Crimson ended the first quarter down, 13-0, Wilson and his teammates remained calm on the sidelines as their coaches reminded them that it often takes exactly one play to change the course of a game.
And that is exactly what happened.
After Harvard rallied to score two touchdowns in the second quarter to take a tenuous 14-13 lead, Wilson found the end zone on a 51-yard interception return, bringing the Crimson up a full possession.
“That was an unbelievable play by Jaron,” senior linebacker Joshua Boyd said. “It was a big momentum shift. Jaron was in the position where he was supposed to be and he was doing his job. Once the ball was in his hands, he switched from defense to offense, and seeing all the guys out front blocking him, it was natural.”
As a returning starter, Wilson had been trying to do his part to get his team hyped up on the sidelines, but he recognizes there’s only so much talking one can do.
“I was on the sideline trying to get them motivated and excited, but there’s no greater motivation than leading by example and doing it on the field,” Wilson said. “We were able to switch from playing not-to-lose to actually playing to win and playing to be aggressive. There is no greater feeling for a defensive player than to find yourself in the end zone holding the ball and to actually be there myself was unbelievable.”
Boyd has seen his Wilson’s leadership develop in both his play and his comfort level in motivating younger players.
“With all the seniors, there’s  sense of urgency with this being the final season,” Boyd said. “We’re the leaders of the team. Being a safety and defensive back, communication is key for the defense. Jaron’s always done a great job of being vocal and making sure everyone’s on the same page. He prides himself on being a hard hitter and it’s all coming together for him.”
Though Wilson scored his first collegiate touchdown last Saturday, but it wasn’t his first time in the end zone. The senior played receiver, quarterback and safety at Del Campo High School in California, where he also lettered in basketball and baseball.
He has taken much of what he learned as a high school point guard onto the football field.
“As a point guard, you have to be extremely vocal, calling out the plays as they come down court and taking charge of the offense as a whole,” Wilson said. “As a safety I’m the furthest one back on the defense. I’m the only one who can see absolutely everything. Being able to communicate what I see and what other people are supposed to do as well as what I’m doing all at once is something that I’ve implemented into my football career.”
Wilson is not the first successful athlete in his family—the senior’s father was formerly a cornerback at Air Force.
“I wanted nothing other than to be him from a young age,” said Wilson, whose family has traveled to multiple games every season. “As a little kid I was always into sports. Football was my dream. Playing collegiate football was my dream especially. Our positions are so similar so being able to pick his brain on certain techniques has been great.”
He might be far from home, but Wilson is determined to make the most of his final season playing for the Crimson.
“It’s been a life-changing experience to say the least,” Wilson said. “The education that I’m receiving just by being here is the best in the world. But the ability to play football on top of it is such a blessing. Football at Harvard is where football began. The game itself changed because of Harvard Stadium. I’m just super appreciative to be a part of it and trying to make the most of it in this last year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In just its third week of competition, the Harvard sailing team proved its mettle by finishing in the top-five in all three of its regattas this weekend. The greatest standout came from done by freshmen Juan Perdomo, who has guaranteed himself a spot at Nationals in November.
31st HOOD TROPHY
The Crimson finished the weekend strong on Mystic Lake in Medford, Mass., where it took home second place overall.
Despite the unfavorable wind conditions on the enclosed water, Harvard was able to finish with 97 points. Tufts, the host of the event, took first with an impressive 45 points.
“It ended up being a pretty good weekend for us despite the conditions,” said sophomore crew Jacob Bradt. “It was a tough event because of both the conditions and venue, as well as the boats—lark regattas are unique fleets.”
Teamed with junior skipper Brian Drumm, the duo’s performance looked barely affected. They finished in the top seven for every rotation except one in the A division. Additionally, they had a resounding first place finish in the regatta’s finale.
“We were able to be consistent, which was important,” he said. “We only had one outlier in our scores.”
Junior Gram Slattery and freshman Emma Wheeler were able to take second in the B division.
“We did a really good job working together,” she said. “Figuring out where the shifts were on the water and choosing the path accordingly.”
REGIS BOWL
The women used their home waters to their advantage this weekend as they finished in fifth place for this in-conference regatta on the Charles. Boston University, the hosts of the competition, finished in second, behind Yale and just ahead of Bowdoin.
The lack of wind on both mornings delayed racing and sailors were using FJs in this regatta.
Senior Caitlin Watson took to the water with two freshmen, Julia Lord and Olivia Kjorlien, finishing eighth in the A division. Junior Ashleigh Inglis and sophomore Sophie Bermudez finished fourth in the B division.
“The women… had a great performance up in Boston,” Bradt said. “In general, on all fronts, it was a great weekend.”
NEISA MEN’S SINGLEHANDED CHAMPIONSHIP
It was an exciting two days for two Harvard male sailors who competed in the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association Championship for singlehanded lasers. The Crimson sent sophomore Marek Zeleski and rookie standout Perdomo to Yale, which was hosting the event.
In only his second collegiate regatta, Perdomo finished in third place, thereby qualifying for nationals, which will be held in November. The freshman is the first to qualify for nationals since Kyle Kovacks ’08 did so during his senior fall season in 2007.
Yale Freshmen Ian Barrows and Joseph Kiss, University of Vermont Junior Michael Zonnenberg, and sophomore Avery Fanning of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy finished on either side of Perdomo and also qualified for Nationals.
Zeleski, despite matching Fanning at 78 points, lost in the tiebreaker and did not make the cut to join his teammate. Last year he placed in 10th in this regatta.
Perdomo finished three rotations in second place and the final round in first. Zeleski also racked in a first place finish in his fifth rotation.
Despite the results, Perdomo believes he could have done better.
“The conditions were not the strongest and we would have liked to finished stronger,” he said. “The wind was really weak today, a lot weaker than the winds I’m used to back home in Puerto Rico.”
Racing alone is Perdomo’s forte, as he has always competed in lasers. Last weekend he competed in the Nevins Trophy in a boat with which he is not familiar, a 420.
“My starts were a lot better this weekend,” he said. “But my speed wasn’t as great as the other guys; the wind was light and choppy.”
Perdomo stressed the critical role of practice on the water and exposure to new and challenging conditions in his success.
“Overall, the team is pretty happy with how we did,” Bradt said. “We are improving, and this has really been seen over the last three weeks. But on the finer details we could definitely improve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Jordan sat scrolling through new emails during an informal team meeting in August of last year, one message on the laptop screen stood out.
It was from the Office of the Secretary of the Administrative Board, and about 125 other Harvard students—many of whom had not yet arrived on campus or had graduated that past May—had already or would soon receive emails very much like it. It told them they were being investigated by the Ad Board regarding their work in a government course they had enrolled in the previous spring and instructed them to meet with Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison as soon as possible.
Jordan, a fall varsity athlete who requested a pseudonym to avoid association with the cheating case that would become known as the Government 1310 scandal, was not the only person in the room that day to receive the bad news.
“My face turned pale, and I noticed a lot of other kids on my team looking over at me,” Jordan recalled. “And they had this look on their faces like they knew what was going on.”
It was the beginning of an ordeal that sidelined the co-captains of the men’s basketball team, created significant turnover on several varsity rosters, and, some student-athletes said, changed the way that Harvard athletics are perceived both on campus and further afield.
Today, with many departed athletes now back on campus and with their teams, the spectre of Government 1310 no longer looms in quite the same way over Harvard’s athletic courts and fields. But as members of Harvard’s athletics community try to put the saga behind them, the memory of the scandal remains fresh.
AFTER THE EMAIL
For some students, receiving the dreaded Government 1310 email meant talking to parents, weighing financial considerations, rethinking academic plans, and perhaps preparing to move back home. For many athletes like Jordan, particularly those who compete in the fall, it meant an additional set of calculations—deciding whether to take the field, stay in school but sit on the sidelines, or preemptively take a leave of absence.
Faced with these added burdens, some athletes also received support and advice from members of the Athletic Department.
The day after receiving the Ad Board email, Jordan was called into the Athletic Department to meet with a compliance officer to discuss possible routes forward. In the meeting, the compliance officer urged Jordan not to play with the team in an upcoming organized sporting event. If Jordan played in that event and then was required to withdraw in connection with the scandal, Jordan would lose one of four possible seasons of eligibility, the officer said.
Jordan opted to sit out for a third of the season before receiving a packet detailing the evidence the Ad Board had compiled concerning Jordan’s case. It was only then that Jordan felt informed enough to make a decision about whether to start playing or to withdraw.
But even before that, Jordan and other accused teammates faced the issue of communicating the situation to the rest of the team.
“It was something that we went through as a group,” Jordan remembered. “We addressed the team as a group, we explained the situation as a group. It was really a group thing. Within the next 24 hours, it was really becoming a thing that we realized was not contained to our team.”
As rumors of other classmates being investigated started to swirl in the last days of the summer, Jordan remembers that things were “quieter” than expected. But that silence was short-lived, when, on August 30 of last year, Harvard proactively announced that it had a massive cheating case on its hands.
ATHLETES IN THE SPOTLIGHT
As the scandal unfolded, athletics assumed a central place in the public’s perception of the incident.
Reporters gathered in front of Currier House after news broke that the basketball co-captains and Currier roommates Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry would withdraw from the College for a year in connection with the Government 1310 scandal in order to maintain their academic eligibility.  They quickly became the face of the scandal under the glare of the national spotlight.
With two of Harvard’s most prominent athletes publicly branded as cheaters, the scandal piqued interest in discussions about the role of athletics at Harvard. Accusations of lowered academic standards were levied at men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, Athletics Director Robert L. “Bob” Scalise, and the administration.
Suspicions that this was an athletes’ scandal were raised as it became increasingly clear that Government 1310’s reach was not just limited to Curry and Casey, or even just one or two sports.
On September 10, 2012, just five days before the football team’s season opener against San Diego, a report surfaced that Harvard’s team was bracing for potential roster changes as a result of the investigation. The news about Curry and Casey broke on Sept. 11, and the Sept. 12 leak of Platt’s initial complaint letter identified members of the baseball team as among the accused students. Media outlets also soon reported that men’s hockey had been affected by the scandal.
“The scariest thing with the whole situation was how public it got,” Jordan said. “Now I’m going back home for Thanksgiving, and people are asking me if I was involved in the cheating scandal.”
Despite this attention paid toward athletes, the number of student-athletes affected by the scandal could not be definitively confirmed. Even as rosters appeared seemingly depleted, all reports that missing players were gone due to their involvement in the scandal ultimately amounted to speculation.
It should be noted that student-athletes set to return to a team choose instead to leave their sport for any number of reasons on a regular basis. In 2009, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy estimated that the retention rate of recruited athletes across all sports was roughly 70 percent over the previous 15 years. An analysis of Harvard’s varsity rosters from the previous three seasons shows that somewhere between 125 and 150 non-graduating athletes who would be expected to return to a team’s roster do not the following year. Student-athletes leave teams due to injury, personal issues, or just to pursue other interests. 
COPING ON AND OFF THE FIELD
Even as it runs the most varsity athletic programs of any university in the country, the Harvard administration prides itself on a commitment to maintaining academic standards in the pursuit of athletic success, according to Jerry R. Green, political economy professor and chair of the Faculty Standing Committee on Athletic Sports.
“It is important to recognize that all Harvard students are treated equally and all are held to the same standards of academic performance and integrity,” Green wrote in an email. “That is one of the things that makes Harvard special.”
Yet in the case of Government 1310, it became quickly apparent that despite a formal commitment to equality, athletes being investigated would be forced to grapple with a series of considerations that their non-athlete classmates would not. Foremost among these was the issue of athletic eligibility.
“No other student who was being investigated was forced to put off doing the thing that they love because they might get in trouble,” Jordan said. “That wouldn’t have happened for someone on the Quiz Bowl team. It’s crazy.”
Though a voluntary withdrawal was not necessarily equivalent to an admission of guilt, in the eyes of many, it constituted as much.
Geoffrey B. Stearns ’82—a member of the Friends of Harvard Basketball, a group of alumni supporters of the program—said he felt particularly sympathetic towards Curry and Casey, who he believes were singled out in media coverage of the scandal.
“You heard Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey’s name over and over again,” Stearns said. “I felt badly for those two individuals.”
REACTING FROM WITHIN
WIth the fates of accused athletes uncertain as season openers approached, coaches started to prepare for the worst. Many were forced to try to predict the outcome of various investigations with little to no knowledge of an end date. Though none of the coaches asked for comment were willing to discuss the specifics of this procedure, Green applauded their professionalism in the middle of an unexpected situation.
“I am proud of our coaches for upholding high academic standards and for their understanding of how the College was going to handle the matter,” Green wrote. “Faced with some unanticipated roster changes, they were 100 percent  professional in a very difficult time.”
Beyond the struggles faced by particular teams in the aftermath of the announcement, the Athletic Department immediately confronted internal communications decisions and an external public relations crisis.
The Athletic Department faced the challenge of disseminating clear and accurate information to coaches, accused students, and administrators regarding the specific considerations facing student-athletes implicated in the scandal.
Student-athletes interviewed for this story said the Athletic Department informed all of the varsity coaches of the scope of the investigation in a single briefing, though the context in which the brief was conducted could not be confirmed. Sources in the Athletic Department neither confirmed nor denied that the briefing was delivered in a meeting, stating that department-wide meetings are fairly common and such a topic could have been on the agenda.
On Aug. 16 of last year, Ellison sent an email to the resident deans advising them on how to counsel student-athletes implicated in the scandal. Though the content of the email only contained general advising recommendations, the email helped set into motion a series of events that had reverberations far beyond the scope of the cheating scandal. A leak of Ellison’s email to The Crimson was part of administrators’ justification for secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts that some have suggested led to the resignation of former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, though she has disputed that account.
Throughout it all, the Athletic Department opted for official silence on the issue. In the year since the scandal broke, the department has maintained a stance of no comment on the incident, and a handful of coaches interviewed by Crimson sports reporters over the past year have declined to talk on the record about implications of the scandal for their team’s season.
Even a year later, sources within the Athletic Department informed The Crimson that an email was sent to all 42 varsity coaches instructing them to refer all inquiries regarding this Crimson article to Tim Williamson, director of athletic communications. Williamson did not respond to requests for comment, though he referred questions regarding athletic eligibility to the Ivy League Office.
LOOKING FORWARD
More than a year after the announcement of the investigation, Green suggested that it is time to move past the scandal.
“Now that time has passed and the students who withdrew have returned to campus, I think we should warmly welcome them back,” Green wrote. “There are many lessons to be learned from this episode and I hope that we will keep these lessons in mind as we move forward.”
Yet not all athletes feel warmly welcomed back. One athlete told The Crimson she feels uncomfortable telling her professors that she is an athlete due to fears that she will be treated differently in the classroom.
John E. Dowling, neuroscience professor and member of the Faculty Standing Committee on Athletic Sports, disputed the idea that faculty members are treating student-athletes any differently in the wake of Government 1310.
"I do not feel that faculty sentiments regarding athletics were changed at all by the scandal,” Dowling wrote in an email. “I have never heard any faculty member saying anything along these lines.”
Despite the ordeal of the past year, Jordan too has found reason for optimism. Even following an experience Jordan would rather forget, Jordan is still proud to play a sport at Harvard.
“I wouldn’t say I’m hesitant to tell professors that I’m an athlete,” Jordan said. “I don’t think they would put any judgments on me. I know some people that feel differently, but not me.”

With punch season now in full swing, it’s time to present the results of Flyby’s first-ever Final Club Survey. In this first installment of a six-part series on the survey results, we take a look at just who apparently answered our questions.
 
In an online survey conducted from Sept. 12-18, we asked upperclassmen a variety of questions about their perceptions and beliefs regarding Harvard’s eight male and five female final clubs.
 
We emailed out the online survey to 4,838 sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and received responses back from 1,927 fully or at least partially completed surveys. To ensure that the survey was truly anonymous, respondents were in no way linked to their answers; as a result, it is possible that individuals could have taken the survey more than once.
 
We relied on self-reported demographic data to better understand who filled out the survey.
 
Respondents to our survey were evenly split by class year—31 percent said they were members of the Class of 2016, 34 percent identified with the Class of 2015, and 33 percent said they plan to graduate with the Class of 2014. Women were slightly more likely to respond than men—54 percent of respondents identified as female, while 46 percent said they are male. And the vast majority of respondents, 90 percent, identified as heterosexual. An additional 5 percent identified as homosexual, 3 percent as bisexual, and 1 percent as questioning.
 
Sixty-six percent of survey respondents identified as white, 9 percent as Black or African-American, 15 percent as Asian, and 8 percent as Hispanic or Latino. In comparison, the College reports that among members of the Class of 2017 (who were not polled in this survey), 11 percent are African-American, 20 percent are Asian-American, and 12 percent are Hispanic or Latino.
 
Forty-two percent of respondents reported no past or present affiliation with final clubs. Twenty-one percent of respondents identified as current club members, and 7 percent said they used to be part of one but no longer are. An additional 30 percent said they have punched a final club but did not or have not joined one. Since final clubs do not report their membership numbers, we do not have a way to compare these numbers to the actual percentage of Harvard students in final clubs.
 
Sixteen percent of respondents said that one or both of their parents had attended Harvard College.
 
We don’t claim that the responses represent the opinions of the Harvard College student body at large; rather, they reflect the opinions of those who responded to our survey. Check back on Flyby each day this week for respondents’ thoughts on everything from the clubs’ alcohol selection to their members’ intellect.

Well, it’s a jungle out there. Every Thursday from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., the grass outside the Science Center Plaza is gifted with the presence of farm animals.
This “Plaza Pet Therapy Zoo” is put on by Harvard’s Common Spaces initiative, which aims to foster a stronger sense of community through events like these. The animals featured include chickens, ducks, goats and the occasional kitten or two. But sadly, there are no squirrels.
What kind of therapy do these pets provide? Cuddling these cute animals could help people get over missing their pets, help those who are mad about a terrible B+ realize it’s not the worst thing in the world, and remind those who are suffering as a result of the series finale of "Breaking Bad" that it’s not the "Dexter" series finale.
So if you want to cuddle with someone cute and don’t want to spend your time searching in your lecture class, come visit the petting zoo.

That is the approximate number of meals a college student has in the dining halls of their college each year. If you start the day with breakfast, that number jumps to 504. Despite this, few prospective students know more about how colleges conduct dining life than the general reputation of their food.
 
Harvard sets itself apart from many colleges in that it has one and only one meal plan: unlimited meal swipes and a $65 charge each semester that can be spent at a number of campus cafes. According to Harvard University Dining Services, the establishment of the single-plan option was meant to ensure that all students could participate in House activities on equal footing. 
 
At schools like Harvard, where students are part of a complex residential system, the college dining experience is about far more than food. It is intensely social. According freshman Angela Jiang, because freshmen all eat together in a single dining hall, “you get to know a lot of people in your year. It’s a nice place to meet people, even if you don’t become friends with them.”
 
Dining halls continue to be social spaces even for upperclassmen. When asked what her favorite aspect of dining life at Harvard was, senior Lindiwe Rennart commented, “Since everyone is on a meal plan and generally eat where they live, when you sit down in your dining hall, the chances that you’ll know at least 10 people in the room are at least 95 percent.”
 
This arrangement works at Harvard because more than 98 percent of its students live and dine on campus. At the University of Chicago, where 45 percent of students live off-campus, the school offers meal plans tailored to students’ various dietary habits.
 
The University of Chicago utilizes a meal system similar to that of most colleges. Students choose from a number of different meal plans, which consist of two components in varying ratios: meal swipes and credit that can be used at a variety of locations on campus.
 
Boston University employs such a system. Rajeshwari Jakkam, a freshman at Boston University majoring in neuroscience, articulated one of the greatest drawbacks to the limited meal swipes system: “I’m on the 14 meal per week plan, and I don’t like how if I skip a meal, it doesn’t roll over to the next week.” She said, “I wish I had known [that].” Although Boston University does offer a more flexible semester limited meal plan, the excess meal swipes still do not roll over to the next semester. Like most colleges, it also offers an unlimited meal plan, but it is costlier than the basic one.
 
Another issue prospective students may wish to look into is how well a school accommodates dietary restrictions. Jakkam noted that despite how much she enjoyed Boston University’s many food options, “I don’t eat beef or pork… [and] there are not that many options for vegetarian food."
 
Some colleges will accommodate most dietary restrictions, but might require that students register. At the University of Massachusetts Amherst, students must sign up in advance for the Kosher Meal Plan or individual kosher meals.
