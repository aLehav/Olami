After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It’s always important for students creating any type of art to try to figure out what they are hoping to achieve from their art and to find out how their art affects other people,” says Freshmen Arts Program (FAP) director Dana E. Knox. Knox serves as the faculty advisor for the Harvard Arts Showcase, an informal arts exhibition created by Maya S. Sugarman ’12 and Elliott J. Rosenbaum ’12.
Sugarman and Rosenbaum, who participated in FAP and starred in the Freshmen Musical together as the romantic lead couple, conceived the Harvard Arts Showcase last spring. Both had been invited to sing in a senior recital organized by Beth G. Shields ’10, who was heavily involved with technical theater during her time at Harvard.
During the summer, Sugarman and Rosenbaum recalled their experience in FAP and of performing with students from varying musical and theatrical backgrounds during Shields’ recital. “We remembered how cool it was to see work people had been doing on their own outside the classroom: with their voice teachers, in practice rooms, or even just singing in the shower,” Rosenbaum says.
The founders of the Showcase left the recital with a desire to create a vehicle for artistic effort in any stage of development. “We thought the OFA [Office for the Arts] would be a great place to go to use some of their resources and their space to sort of reignite the artistic spark on campus,” Rosenbaum says. Over the summer, Sugarman and Rosenbaum deliberated about the name and logistics of the event. ‘Showcase’ seemed to best fit the intentions of the exhibition, as it avoided a title like ‘open mic,’ which would exclude displays of visual art, photography, and other installations.
Originally, Sugarman and Rosenbaum imagined the Showcase as an event for singers, but they were then inspired to include artists from other disciplines. “Ideally we would love this to be something that all artists on campus would go to,” Rosenbaum says. “You would walk in, and in the lobby you have someone’s VES [Visual and Environmental Studies] work on display or someone’s photos or someone’s painting, and you’d go upstairs to the studio, and there would be dancers and singers performing alongside musicians and playwrights.”
Sugarman and Rosenbaum have expressed a desire not only to include representatives from all different art forms on campus, but also to involve audiences in dialogue and feedback regarding the performances. “What we really want it to be like is an environment with active participation so we can see how we can work together to improve our art,” Sugarman says.
“I’m excited to see how [the Showcase] develops,” Knox says. “Right now it’s very much a blank slate... I don’t know what to expect nor do I want to project what to expect.”
The first Showcase was held last Friday in the New College Theater Studio. While some students exhibited pieces they had prepared, others chose to perform impromptu. The Showcase featured a diverse array of genres, including indie folk, pop, and classical violin. Patrick W. Spence ’12 shared a hymn for “exiles in the Quad,” a rap about Classical Greece, a tribute to Reverend Peter Gomes, and a poem about the closing of the Quad Library. Founders Sugarman and Rosenbaum sang show tunes from “Minnie’s Boys” and “Lucky Stiff.” Additional performers included Chad R. Cannon ’11, Isabel Q. Carey ’12, Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’10-’11, Christine E. Gummerson ’12, and Emily B. Hecht ’11, with David R. Sawicki ’12 as piano accompaniment. At the event’s close, all participants and attendees gathered around the piano to sing “When You Believe” from “The Prince of Egypt.”
Isabel Q. Carey, ’12, who performed Bon Iver’s “Skinny Love,” says, “I would like to see this become a monthly staple. I think it’s a great opportunity for casual presentation.”
“The objective of this showcase is to provide a safe environment to go out on a limb,” says Knox. “Give it a try! You never know what hidden talents you may have.”

As a quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons in 2004, Michael Vick led his team to the National Football Conference championship game. That season he passed for 2,313 yards, and ran for 902 yards, more than many other starting running backs that year. He was an up-and-coming star and one of the most electrifying players in the National Football League. However, all the fanfare, endorsements, and emulation ended after Vick was indicted for his central role in a dog-fighting ring that went under the name of Bad Newz Kennels. As more and more gruesome details came out about the treatment and killing of the dogs, Vick’s fall from grace came swiftly. The public and the Justice Department had every right to be disgusted at his behavior, and there was substantial cause for his subsequent imprisonment. What does not follow reason, however, is the negative sentiment that still follows Vick, who abided by all of the sanctions put on him.
Vick was sentenced to 23 months in federal prison and after he voluntarily surrendered early to authorities he served 19 of those in prison. Because of good behavior, he spent the remaining months on probation at his home. During that time he maintained employment (as part of his probation rules), by working for a construction company and as a summer youth aide at a Boys and Girls Club. Following his release Vick has spent a large amount of his time on tour with the Humane Society of the United States, speaking at events aimed at ending urban dog fighting. He has continued this partnership into 2010. As for the dogs that were discovered in Vick’s kennel, he has also followed court orders by paying for their rehabilitation and adoption.
While his volunteering and repenting words and efforts received little attention, he did regain national recognition when the Philadelphia Eagles signed him in August 2009 for a one-year contract. The public reaction to this move was no different than his treatment than that preceding his jail time, with protests, outrage, and shock over the Eagles’ decision.
This continued pernicious treatment of Vick is void of any forgiveness or any recognition of his concordance with his sentence. Michael Vick committed a crime, a violent and gruesome crime, and was punished for it by our legal system. But, Vick has fulfilled the exact punishment given to him, served his jail time, completed his probation program gracefully, and has since gone on to advocate for the exact opposite of his criminal actions. By not developing a more nuanced view of this man, opponents devalue and discredit the severity of imprisonment and the genuine effort put into rebuilding one’s character and reputation.
If there is no chance for Vick, or anyone who has done wrongs to receive public forgiveness, then no incentive exists for them to make up for their misdeeds. We should not forget or hide Vick’s past, but tying him only to his mistakes veils the positive steps he has taken for himself, for the animal-rights movement, and for the rehabilitative capacity of the American justice system.
Michael Vick is again in the news, when recently, as a back up for the Eagles, the starting quarterback was sidelined due to a concussion. Stepping in, Vick once again is a starting quarterback in the NFL, 44 months since the last time he has held that position. As quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, Vick has passed for 750 yards and six touchdowns in just three games. Mindful of both his troubled past and improving present, I am amazed at his ability on the football field. Just as in 2004, I root for Michael Vick.

Google Street View has seen some controversy lately. The Czech Republic has recently decided not to allow Google to continue taking photographs for the company’s data-mapping system, which offers users a panoramic view of an area from the street level. This decision was made in response to concerns regarding the privacy of citizens, although existing pictures are still available for use and negotiations between the two sides are still in progress.
Google says that it protects citizens enough by blurring faces and taking down images that are subject to complaints, and we agree. We believe that the service is useful: It provides a public good and therefore should be allowed to continue providing people all over the world with information about what different parts of the world—or even their own streets—look like. We hope that the Czech Republic will come to terms with the fact that what Google provides will not seriously compromise any of its citizens, considering that if they ask for it to be taken down, it will be.
The Czech Republic, however, is not alone in its concerns regarding Google Street View. In Germany, where the service will be implemented in November of this year, the government has accused Google of collecting wi-fi data that was sent over unencrypted networks while gathering pictures for the service. Taking a cue from the Czechs, the government has also asked that citizens be given a period of time to opt-out of being photographed before the service is launched. This means that besides faces and license plates being blurred and the option of applying for removal of an image—all standard procedure for Street View in America and elsewhere—German citizens can decide to prevent photographs of their property from appearing on the website before the service even goes live.
However, some opponents of Street View are not satisfied even by Germany’s demands and want the service to be opt-in. This would mean that, in order for a picture of one’s house to be posted, one would have to give explicit permission—an unrealistic expectation. Making the service opt-in would dramatically decrease the amount of information available on it and would make the program basically worthless. Although we do not even think that opting out is entirely necessary, it is a much better compromise than forcing all content to be opt-in.
In the United States, citizens do not reserve the right to privacy in the public domain, where it is understood that requesting permission for a picture to be taken is a courtesy rather than a legal obligation. It is our hope that other countries trend toward a more progressive outlook in regard to this service, allowing similar technologies to be put in place in their nations as well.

The Park51 mosque continues to be the focus of most mainstream media outlets, but last week, it was a controversy around a smaller mosque located in Roxbury, Massachusetts, that truly illustrated an important point about the role of religion in America. The Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center became the subject of fierce local debate when a video showed that several Wellesley  Middle School students had bowed their heads and prayed while on a field trip at the mosque. There was immediate outrage in the surrounding community, and many invoked “separation of church and state” to suggest that the school should not have been permitted to take children to a mosque at all. While it seems clear that students shouldn’t have been allowed to participate in a religious prayer ceremony while on a school field trip, the controversy more broadly illustrates Americans’ irrational fears about acknowledging religion in the classroom.
The Supreme Court has been clear about a crucial distinction between “the teaching of religion,” which would violate First Amendment rights by indoctrinating children, and “teaching about religion,” which would not violate rights but objectively address issues of historical and cultural significance in a secular context. This distinction acknowledges religion’s historical importance and recognizes that it forms an essential component of any complete education. Religion has been cited as a motivation for crucial historical occurrences, as a cause of war, as a factor in the rise and fall of cultures; events from the Inquisition to the Crusades cannot be comprehended apart from an understanding of comparative religions and the beliefs behind each.
More significantly, educating children in the beliefs of the major world religions broadens their worldviews, expands their cultural knowledge, and promotes understanding of diverse perspectives—the fundamental underpinnings of a successful and open-minded education. As the political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset eloquently expressed it, “Education presumably broadens men’s outlooks, enables them to understand the need for norms of tolerance, [and] restrains them from adhering to extremist and monistic doctrines.” Toleration cannot be conveyed unless students are taught about the religions to which their tolerance must be extended, as well as the beliefs those religions hold.
In this regard, the class at Wellesley  Middle School seems exemplary. Entitled “Enduring Beliefs in the World Today,” it studies Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, and Judaism and includes accompanying trips to a mosque, a gospel music show, and a synagogue, as well as a meeting with Hindu representatives. Schools in Modesto, California, have successfully implemented a similar program, requiring a religion class for all high school students. For most, such classes probably seem uncontroversial, but the vitriolic outcry against the trip to the mosque demonstrates that not all Americans are comfortable with an acknowledgement of world religions in our public schools.
This argument for teaching about religion in the classroom necessarily extends further. It also means that courses teaching the Bible, and possibly other religious texts, should be included in public school curricula. The Bible has influenced not only the history, but also the language and rhetoric, that has defined America’s development; like world religion classes, it therefore deserves a place in the nation’s classrooms. Nonetheless, courses on the Bible are open to one objection not available to those who protest classes on comparative religion: Some, like lawyer Wendy Kaminer, have argued that teaching the Bible “outside of close conjunction with other religions” amounts to preferential treatment of the text and an abandonment of government neutrality.
However, different religions have had disproportionate influences on world history, and teachings about these religions will naturally reflect their role in the period of time or topic under consideration. Textbooks need not be tailored to devote equal pages to all religious beliefs, as was suggested by members of the Texas State Board of Education who cited a “pro-Islamic” bias in current teaching tools. History cannot be altered to account for concerns about political correctness. The Bible deserves to be taught in our classrooms, whether it be in a class solely devoted to the biblical text or in one that analyzes a broader array of religious documents.
In the case at hand, however, participating in a prayer ceremony in a mosque goes beyond teaching students about religion. Teachers should have prevented the students from taking part in the ceremony, not least because these middle schoolers may not have known exactly what they were doing and their parents might not have approved of their actions. Allowing students to participate in a religious ceremony clearly crosses the line between “teaching about religion” and “teaching religion.” The goal of the field trip was not to teach students how to pray, but to teach them how others pray.
Although students should have been prevented from engaging in the prayer ceremony, the incident also demonstrates Americans’ unfounded fears of any interaction between religion and education. Acknowledging religion’s role in shaping world history and cultures is an essential function—even a duty—of America’s educators. In this sense, taking students to a mosque offers them an invaluable opportunity to experience another religion’s place of worship. More schools should be taking advantage of similar opportunities in their own communities, breaking down what Thomas Jefferson referred to as the “wall of separation between church and state." This wall is constructed only out of irrationality and intolerance for the diverse world faiths that could be discussed in its absence.

The latest round to jump start the Palestinian-Israeli face-to-face negotiations that President Barack H. Obama, along with Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu, President Mubarak of Egypt, King Abdullah of Jordan, and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas ushered in with so much fanfare is already lingering between political apathy and half-hearted optimism. Owing to the faltering of this new phase of the peace process I have decided to hone my political skills so that I may shed new light on this 502-year stretch of conflict and negotiations to reach a solution or solutions that would be accepted by both sides. It finally dawned on me what this process needs is essentially two simultaneous and complementary approaches. The first includes leaps of faith over the many hurdles standing in the way of an enduring peace. The second involves discarding all other schemes to achieve peaceful settlement utilized since the Camp David Agreement and the Oslo Accords and instead adopt new measures to tackle the paramount issues first and not last.
The giant leaps I have in mind are similar to those undertaken by the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the late Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Rabin. The Egyptian President Anwar Sadat took a giant yet risky leap when he decided to bypass all the unnecessary details of peacemaking and opted instead to go directly to Israel and deliver a speech before the Israeli Knesset thereby breaking every taboo that kept his predecessor and many other Arab leaders shackled for years. This was also the case with the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who also took a leap of faith when he decided to conduct direct negotiations with the Palestinians. Rabin, like Sadat, was a military man who along with the Egyptian President had the courage to, as the bible says to beat “Their swords into plowshares” and transformed themselves from warriors to peace makers. The assassination of Sadat and Rabin precisely because of their audacious approach was truly a tragedy that befell two men who had the vision to look beyond the immediate circumstances and instead reached out to a future that others could not imagine let alone realize. Daring ventures and leaps of faith such as these could save both sides the agony of haggling over minor issues and spare them countless years of poring over less significant details.
The second approach is a pyramidal method to problem solving. If we think of the Arab-Israeli problems as a pyramid naturally we would think that the immediate or urgent problems form the top of the pyramid and the other less urgent problems form the middle and the base of the pyramid. The top problems form a first category and the rest form a second category. The problems or issues in category one include the status of Jerusalem, the creation of a viable Palestinian state and the recognition of Israel as a Jewish state. Once these issues are settled all other issues in the sub-categories ranging from a gradual normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states to economic and cultural cooperation, and from sharing water resources to whether the Jews or the Palestinians were the first to come up with the recipe for humus, can then be worked on.
When those involved in peacemaking and tackling major obstacles to permanent peace become deadlocked or find themselves hemmed in by immediate demands and pressures they could always find inspiration and guidance in their holy scriptures, whether they are Christian, Jewish, or Muslim that urge them to pursue peace no matter how steep are the sacrifices. While the Muslim holy Quran promotes peace by advising Prophet Muhammad that, “If the enemy inclines towards peace, do thou incline towards peace also, and trust in Allah (God)” (Quran ch. 8:61), and the Bible proclaims, “Blessed are the peace makers, for they shall be called sons of God” (Matthew ch. 5:9), in the Psalms of David God commands him to, “Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace and pursue it” (Psalms ch. 34:14).

Students, scientists, and businessmen gathered in Boylston Hall this past Saturday for an inspiring display of what good one can do with the right tools at “Igniting Innovation: A Summit on Social Entrepreneurship.”
The conference was an effort to inspire students “to solve problems—applying creativity not just for profit but for public service,” said one of the organizers, Elliot Ikheloa ’11.
The summit, an all-day event organized by Willa P. Zhou ’12 and other Harvard students involved in public service, featured focus groups centered around education, design, social reform, water sanitation, and art and activism, in particular geographic regions.
Along with these panels, various organizations, including Nika Water and Ashoka Youth Venture, gave presentations to participants.
“There is a water crisis. Over 1.2 billion people don’t have access to clean water, and even more lack access to water infrastructure like sewage systems,” said Kara M. Kubarych ’13, who co-founded Nika—which means “to give” in Zulu—Water.
Kubarych helped start the organization as a senior in high school with Jeffrey D. Church, who graduated from Harvard Business School in 1988. Church explained the financial workings of the company, which sells bottled water and donates the profits to countries in need of clean water.
“It costs $20 to bring clean water to someone for life, so $1 million a year provides water for 50,000 people,” Church said.
Another student venture represented at the summit was Sweetbag, created by Marjorie Lacombe ’13.
Lacombe sells handmade commodities such as purses and jewelry online, using the profits to donate toys, school supplies and medical instruments to children in Ghana, Kenya and Bolivia.
“There was a lot I could do, even as a young person,” said Lacombe, echoing the common theme of the summit: using innovation to solve social problems. Bret D. Carr, who manages the Boston office of Ashoka’s Youth Venture, spoke about the organization, which provides seed funding for youth projects.
The goal of Ashoka Youth Venture, and social entrepreneurship as a whole, said Carr “is to cultivate social entrepreneurs by encouraging youth to mesh a social problem with their talent.”
Carr started working for the funding program after his inspiring experience working with local children in Madagascar, who made soccer balls out of trash bags and tape.
About 150 students attended the event, which is in its inaugural year.
“I think it’s really fantastic and necessary that there be a sustained dialogue about social entrepreneurship on campus,” said participant Tara Suri ’13, who also helped organize the conference.

Cancer screening programs might be less effective than previously thought, according to a study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Oslo University Hospital in Norway. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week, used data from four groups of Norwegian women diagnosed with breast cancer.
Researchers found a 4.8 decrease in the number of deaths from breast cancer per 100,000 person-years in the group of women followed from 1996 to 2005 not offered mammograms versus women in another non-screening group followed from 1986 to 1995. They found a decrease of 7.2 per 100,000 person-years in the 1995 to 2005 group who were offered mammograms compared to the 1986 to 1995 group.
Person-years refers to the number of people in the study cohort times the number of years they were followed.
School of Public Health Professor and lead author of the study Marvin Zelen said he was aware that his team’s findings would be controversial, but that the study was not criticizing the effectiveness of the mammogram itself.
But Daniel B. Kopans ’69, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School, said that the study slights the real benefits of mammograms.
According to Kopans, one of the major flaws of the study was that it followed women for 2.2 years after they were diagnosed with breast cancer, counting only those who died within those 2.2 years as a death.
“This is a trivial amount of follow-up for almost any cancer study, but for breast cancer it is totally unsupportable,” Kopans wrote in an e-mail. “Mammography does not save lives instantaneously. With breast cancer at least 5-10 years of follow-up are needed to have legitimate data.”
Kopans also criticized the fact that while Norwegian breast cancer data is available through at least 2008, the present study stops at 2005.
“The New England Journal has had a major, undeclared, publication bias, since 1993, against mammography screening, but particularly with regard to screening women in their forties,” Kopans wrote.

By isolating aerosol particles from an area in the Amazon basin nearly untouched by humans, a team of researchers led by Harvard Professor of Environmental Chemistry Scot T. Martin was able to examine how plant emissions,  cloud formation, and precipitation affect each other in an unadulturated ecosystem.
About 500 years ago, the clouds over the continents and the clouds over the ocean were similar to each other, Martin said. This is no longer true in most areas due to pollution. Martin added that the results of this recent study showed that this resemblance can still be seen in the Amazon, the “Green Ocean.”
Martin left Harvard  for the 2007-08 academic year to study first at the Max Planck Institute in Germany and then at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, where he began to work on the project, the findings of which were reported in a recent issue of Science.
Martin and the team collected data about environmental particles in a 40-meter tower, sucking the air down in tubes with a vacuum pump on the ground. The particles were then measured and analyzed by online mass spectrometers.
The study, because it was conducted in an area devoid of most human activity, could provide a starting point to investigate how humans affect the climate, said University of Colorado Postdoctoral Fellow and contributor to the study Delphine K. Farmer.
“In pre-industrial times, this cycle was really important,” said Farmer, referring to how plants and rainfall affect each other. “But by human activity, we are changing the importance of cycle.”
Martin pointed to the potential implications of this study. “We are understanding how the science system of the earth operated before human influence,” said Martin. “That’s important for two reasons: we can understand how we have changed the earth system, and, as we think about global climate change and technological solutions, we want to be sure that we don’t have unintended negative consequences.”
Martin hopes to continue the study next year.
“We don’t know how the pollution changes this dynamic cycle and what that means for climate change,” said Farmer. “But we got a starting place to think about it so that’s really the key.”

A competitive buzz filled the air as 40 lbs. of spinach were rolled out onto Dunster St. in preparation of b.good’s seventh annual “Garlicky-Greens Eating World Championship” on Saturday afternoon.
Jon J. Olinto, co-owner and co-founder of b.good, said that the restaurant created the competition seven years ago to encourage a sense of community around the business.
“We wanted to get the customers engaged and build a family,” Olinto said. “We didn’t want to be just one more restaurant.”
To commemorate their loyal patrons’ unique tastes, b.good decided upon the strangest item on its menu—garlicky-greens—as the focus of the competition. The rules are simple: eat as much of the vegetable as possible in five minutes, and the victor wins burgers for an entire year.
But for many of the competitors, the event was about much more than wholesome family fun.
“I’m doing this for the pride and glory. I detest spinach. I just don’t plan on chewing,” said Neil T. Curran ’12, who also participated in this year’s Chickwich Challenge and emerged victorious.
But another competitor—a student from Yale who goes by his stage name “King Hungry VIII”—made clear his intentions to topple Curran, along with all other Harvard students.
“I’ve been training very hard. I want to stick it to all these snooty Harvard people and show them that Yale is number one,” he said, leaning back to stretch out his stomach just minutes before competitors were called to the stage. “I’m in it to win it.”
But Curran said that he was more concerned about local elementary school teacher Alysa M. Breyer, a 5-foot-2 vegan weighing about 95 lbs.: “This is all she eats,” Curran said, referring to the spinach. “I think she’s the dark horse.”
Curran, it turned out, had every right to be worried. Breyer won the competition by shoveling down 2 lb. 4.5 oz. of b.good’s garlicky-greens.
“The spinach was seasoned really well. I actually enjoyed eating it,” said Bryer, who had prepared for the competition by increasing the amount of food she consumed to expand the size of her stomach.
But other competitors did not share Breyer’s sentiments. Nearly halfway through the competition, Curran’s defeat seemed inevitable as his fierce look of focus slowly melted into a nauseated grimace.
“It was disgusting,” Curran said after the competition. “I nearly hurled three times.”
Meanwhile, King Hungry VIII struggled to finish even half a pound. “Yale will continue to be second place,” said Collin A. Jones ’12, an avid supporter of Curran who placed second in the Chickwich Challenge. “They have never been good at math anyways.”
When asked if he would participate in the competition next year, Curran said that he “probably” would if invited back—unfortunately for him, Breyer shared the same response.

In its first general meeting of the semester, the Undergraduate Council launched a new initiative focusing on social life and passed a series of funding allocation measures for the coming semester.
The council voted to create a five- person Social Life Task Force that will administer an online survey this month, analyze the results, and create recommendations to address the problems that the survey highlights.
UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said that having data on how and where students spend their time and what they see as the biggest problems with Harvard social life will give the UC a more “systematic” way of approaching the issues highlighted.
“Social life is the most important thing we’re going to do this semester, and it’s the most important thing we could do this semester,” Hysen said.
According to UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11, the new Task Force has already been given the responsibility for planning future UC-sponsored tailgates and will have the freedom to propose other events that come from the survey results.
During last night’s meeting, the council also passed a series of fund appropriation measures for the coming semester, including passing its own budget and allocating $5,300 to each House Council.
While this budget is slightly lower than last year’s, according to UC Treasurer Brad M. Paraszczak ’11 the increased allocation that each House will get from the Student Life Fund will raise each House Council budget overall.
In addition, the UC set aside $20,000 from the general UC Grants Fund—to which student groups apply for funding for term-time events and supply costs—to be used for student-led activities during Optional Winter Activities Week, the final week before spring term begins.
These grants, unlike term-time UC funding, will be open to propos
als from individual student and unrecognized student groups.
“We do want to treat the week as different from normal weeks,” Hysen said. “We’re the only group that’s specifically setting aside funding [for students].”
The council also voted to pass larger grants to two student groups—$5,000 each semester to the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors and $20,000 for the year to the Phillips Brooks House Association, one of the largest student organizations on campus.
According to Dunster UC representative Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13, who worked on the PBHA legislation in the UC Finance Committee, last year all PBHA organizations had to apply individually to the UC for funding. The new legislation passed last night will give the PBHA executive board the power to decide how funding is split between its programs.
“This marks a major difference in the way we give out money, and it allows big umbrella groups to oversee the ways they deal with money,” Bowman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Doctors and workers from the non-profit organization Partners in Health, joined by Harvard students and the former Prime Minister of Haiti Michèle Pierre-Louis, gathered in Sanders Theatre on Saturday to review and discuss the organization’s progress in conducting relief efforts in Haiti since the Jan. 12 earthquake.
Partners in Health Executive Director Ophelia M. Dahl opened the symposium by commending the work of the group’s staff and volunteers in Haiti, who were able to treat additional disaster patients after the earthquake while avoiding any interruptions in routine patient treatments.
Partners In Health’s Chief of Mission for Haiti Louise Ivers and her driver Ounsel Mede both recounted their first-hand experiences of the earthquake’s aftermath.
Ivers said she and Mede were forced to sleep in their car—damaged by a collapsed wall during the earthquake—for two months as she delivered medical aid to those impacted by the quake.
“Accompaniment remained a common theme of our work,” Ivers said. “It doesn’t mean we were doing everything ourselves, it means we were using our bodies to share the burden.”
Mede, who shared his side of the story in Creole, said that even when Ivers told him he could leave her and go home to his family, he responded that “just like the rest of Haiti, we have to get up and keep going.”
Natasha Archer, a fifth-year medical resident at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, was one of over 80 volunteers from various medical schools who were present in Haiti following the earthquake.
“When the cameras and news crews disappeared every night, so did many of the Haitian volunteers, since they had to return home,” Archer said.
But Partners In Health volunteers kept the camps running at night, she said. Their camps helped over 10,000 patients per week in Haiti’s capital of Port-au-Prince.
Paul E. Farmer, Partners In Health co-founder and chair of the department of global health and social medicine at the Medical School, rounded out the symposium by presenting the earthquake relief team with the 2010 Thomas J. White Prize—the organization’s highest honor.
Farmer also announced the beginning of construction on a $15 million-dollar teaching hospital in Mirebalais, Haiti, the cornerstone of the Partners In Health’s post-earthquake efforts to advance the quality of health care provided to the Haitian community.
“The best hospital in Haiti should be rooted in Haitian soil,” Farmer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nobel laureate Linda B. Buck, a former professor at Harvard Medical School, retracted on Friday two academic papers about olfactory receptors after some of the data was found to be irreproducible.
Buck, currently an affiliate professor in the department of physiology and biophysics at the University of Washington in Seattle, retracted the papers from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Science, respectively published in 2005 and 2006.
Buck served as a neurobiology professor at Harvard Medical School from 2001 to 2002, according to her curriculum vitae. In 2004, she was named a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her studies on the connections between the nose and the brain.
The recent retractions do not mark the first time that Buck has been subject to scrutiny for questionable research. In 2008, she retracted a paper published in Nature in 2001—research for which had been conducted at Harvard.
The incident prompted the University to spearhead an investigation into any evidence of misconduct, according to Medical School spokesperson David J. Cameron.
After the 2008 retraction, Buck and her colleagues returned to earlier academic papers, attempted to reproduce “key findings,” and were unable to do so, according to an e-mailed statement from Kristen L. Woodward, senior media relations manager for Buck’s current employer, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
Buck’s team, which attributed the errors to her former postdoctoral researcher Zhihua Zou’s experiments, also found figures in the Proceedings paper that were inconsistent with the original data, according to Woodward.
“She regrets any confusion that has resulted from the publication of these papers and thanks the colleagues who painstakingly worked with her to duplicate these experiments and evaluate the data,” Woodward said.
Zou signed the retraction for the 2001 Nature article two years ago, but he has declined to sign off on the two recent retractions. His former employer and various news organizations have reported that Zou has returned to China.
As recent as last month, news broke of Harvard Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser’s eight instances of scientific misconduct. But Michael E. Greenberg, head of the neurobiology department at Harvard Medical School, said he doubts that academic misconduct is an ongoing trend among researchers.
“Most often it just turns out to be that science is not that rigorously done,” said Greenberg, who added that he merely knew Buck as a colleague at Harvard. “When people try to reproduce it, they realize that the person was fooling themselves.”
Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor Stephen D. Liberles ’94, a former postdoctoral fellow in Buck’s lab at Harvard, praised Buck for her commitment to scientific accuracy.
“These retractions are a testimony to her integrity and transparency,” he said.
“The scientific process will benefit by these disclosures,” Liberles said.
Greenberg said that Buck’s retractions will benefit the scientific community, for other researchers often read papers published in journals and reproduce or modify the experiments for their own purposes.

The Phillips Brooks House hosted on Saturday its annual Big Bike Auction, raising over $2,000 in support of the association’s 86 programs.
Auction attendees gathered on PBHA’s front lawn to bid on abandoned bicycles that staff members had located and collected during July and August, after most undergraduates had left for summer vacation.
PBHA members had searched the Yard for bicycles that seemed abandoned, tagging them with a note that warned the lock would be cut and the bike removed if unclaimed by a specific date.
Quad Bikes, a non-profit bike shop located in Radcliffe Yard, also helped out the auction by securing the abandoned bicycles and cutting off locks, according to PBHA Events Fundraiser Nadia L. Farjood ’13, an inactive Crimson editor.
Students at the auction inspected the available bikes, looking for ones that matched their needs and price ranges.
Louise M. Wills—PBHA’s grants, technology, and alumni coordinator—had ranked and priced the items according to quality. Bikes labeled “1” for best were in display under a tree, while the rust-stained bikes with “5” taped to their handlebars lay in the grass, some missing tires or seats.
Some attendees expressed their reservations about the quality and cost of the bikes.
“Some would take a lot to fix up,” said Allison E. Rosenberg ’12, considering her other options. “I’ve heard you can get bikes inexpensively through friends or Craigslist.”
But Yannis K. Valtis ’12 noticed a bike that he hoped to ride home on: a Jamis Citizen hybrid bike, ranked a “1,” with a starting bid of $125. Valtis, who originally doubted that he would be successful, ultimately gained possession of the bike after his final bid of $210.
“I spent more than I wanted to, but when its an auction, you end up spending more than you want to,” Valtis said. “I’m very happy.”
Unique to this year’s auction was the inclusion of a moped with a retail price around $700—but nobody bid on the item, according to Farjood.
Harvard University Police Department donated an additional nine bikes to this year’s auction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies celebrated its 50th anniversary, protestors gathered starting at 9:30 a.m. outside of the Science Center on Saturday, denouncing Harvard University for accepting a donation in the name of former Social Studies Head Tutor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz.
Renowned academics and alumni presented on the history and future of the program during the committee’s celebration, which was interrupted by protestors reacting against Peretz’s recent controversial comments.
Members of the Social Studies community pressed the committee during question and answer sessions to explain its decision to honor Peretz—who many said had a 30-year history of issuing hateful language towards blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and Muslims. And at a luncheon during which Peretz was recognized, nearly ten attendees walked out.
Robert P. Wolff ’54, who was principal speaker at the luncheon and the first head tutor of Social Studies, criticized the committee at the luncheon for not taking a harder stance against recognizing Peretz, to much audience applause.
Because Harvard is an “imperial power” in the higher education sphere, it tends to treat all money, regardless of source, as “without stench,” Wolff said at the luncheon.
“I had always hoped that Social Studies would hold itself to a higher standard...but, here, the money stinks.”
Wolff was referring to a research fund focused on sponsorship for undergraduate research on interracial and justice issues in honor of Peretz’s teaching contributions. The fund was paid for by his former students and began with $500,000 in donations, jumping to $650,000 just within the week before the anniversary celebration.
Recent official statements from both the University and the Social Studies committee announced that they would accept the fund. Though the committee decided to remove Peretz’s name from the celebration’s list of speakers, it still recognized him alongside past head tutors and directors of studies, as the position is now termed.
Throughout the past week, over 500 alumni, students, and staff organized to protest Peretz’s coming to Harvard and the University’s acceptance of the fund—a debate that has been extensively covered by national media.
“The notion that because [Peretz] was a beloved teacher that excuses the despicable
things that he says...I find it incomprehensible,”  Wolff said in an interview with The Crimson. “What disturbed me was not simply that he said these things, but that Social Studies was going to honor him by establish a scholarship research fund in his name.”
Wolff continued to suggest that much of Peretz’s antagonistic views derive from his pro-Israeli stance—an issue that Wolff argued was largely ignored because “there are a lot of Jews here, and that’s not an issue that they’re ready to confront openly.”
Wolff also criticized the naming of the fund. “He didn’t even have the grace to say that he didn’t want the fund in his name,” Wolff said. “Next thing you know, he’s going to want his name on every single urinal and bench at Harvard.”
“I knew Marty Peretz 50 years ago, and he was an egregious little wannabe fifty years ago. And fifty years has not improved him one bit,” Wolff said.
Wolff signed the petition to bar Peretz from speaking. Many of the other signatories protested vocally outside the Science Center and Adams House, where the luncheon took place. The rallies drew police attention.
In his opening remarks, Chair of the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies Richard Tuck acknowledged the protestors, encouraging the exercise of free speech, but also asking them to recognize free speech of the celebration’s panel of speakers.
Protests—organized by Maryam M. Gharavi, a sixth year graduate student in the comparative literature department—consisted of protesters raising signs bearing some of Peretz’s controversial past quotes.Gharavi said that although she headed the protests, undergraduates played a huge role in their organization. She added that she was happy so many people, including Social Studies concentrators and alumni, came out to support the cause.
“Students continued to protest for almost six hours—Social Studies undergraduates were especially incensed,” Gharavi said. “People were horrified that a 25-year career in racism would be awarded in this day and age.”
Gharavi also said that she hoped the University would reconsider accepting the fund in Peretz’s name, as she argued that “hateful and bigoted statements should not be honored.”
“We absolutely encourage the administration and President Faust to reverse their decision,” Gharavi said.
Protestors tailed Peretz after a morning panel in the Science Center to greet him outside Adams House Dining Hall. The protestors were audible through the open windows, prompting dining hall workers to quickly shut the windows and close the curtains. Many members of the Social Studies community looked favorably on the protests.
“I’m happy to see the protest,” said History Department Chair James T. Kloppenberg, who serves as a member of the Social Studies Standing Committee. “Social studies is a lively and engaging community, so it’s good that the students are expressing themselves as they are.”
Kloppenberg said that within the Standing Committee “everyone was—without exception—appalled by Peretz’s comments.”
“But people interpreted his second apology differently—I took it as quite a powerful one,” Kloppenberg said. “I’ve been critical of his views on the Middle East for 30 years now, so nothing he says has surprised me or changed what I think of him.”
David A. Jost ’68, who registered to attend the Social Studies celebration well before the debate on the topic began, said “if in fact what [Peretz] said was accurately quoted, things that are so prejudicial to such a large group of citizens is truly reprehensible.”
“I haven’t read the blog,”  William A.M. Blumberg ’68 said, “but what’s been appearing in the national media is just blatant nonsense.”
Blumberg suggested that the committee still made the right decision to “pocket the money,” as the fund would promote values that are consistent with Social Studies.
Princeton professor Michael Walzer, a friend of Peretz, defended both his friend and the fund in an afternoon panel discussion, saying that if people would criticize Peretz’s comments, they should review all annotations and comments made in lecture by other Social Studies professors—to the hissing of audience members. Even as University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann ’71 gave the evening keynote address rounding out the celebration, the controversy over the honoring of Peretz still dominated much of the Saturday celebration.
“Social Studies is not about Marty Peretz, but that’s what this whole celebration has been about,” Wolff said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday afternoon, Andrei S. Markovits, a former research associate at the Center for Euopean Studies, came back to Harvard to discuss his new book “Gaming the World: How Sports Are Reshaping Global Politics and Culture.”
Exchanging jokes and amused looks with long-time friends in the audience, Markovits presented the main ideas of his most recent work, which looks at global sports and the effect they have both locally and worldwide.
“The power of sports lies in their cultural, not financial, capital,” said Markovits, a professor of comparative politics and of German studies at the University of Michigan, who co-wrote his book with Political Science Professor Lars Rensmann, also at the University of Michigan.
Taking New England—“The Red Sox Nation”—as an example, Markovits stressed that local teams can play a crucial role in the development of one’s regional identity. Yet he insisted that sports are also paradoxically cosmopolitan and globalized—games are increasingly broadcast around the world and players often come from outside of their team’s country.
Comparing sports to languages, Markovits predicted that as sports become more widely broadcast, and people learn the rules of some sports, they will be able to more easily learn the rules of others, as may be the case in learning languages.
“People will become increasingly multinational sports speakers,” said Markovits.
The event drew a crowd of about twenty students, faculty, alumni and friends.
Andres D. Uribe ’12, who plays soccer, said he attended because of his interest in the relationship between professional and college sports. Martkovits compared the effect of college sports in the US to professional ones in Europe, in terms of their impact on community identities.
Markovits, who was at the Center from 1976 to 1999, is known for being cultivated, enthusiastic and cheerful, said Center Staff Assistant Anna Popiel.
“Andy is the kind of person everybody wants at a dinner party,” said Popiel.
In spite of his enthusiasm for the topic, Markovits said that sports are still not perceived as serious research subjects today.
“But it moves billions of people,” he said. “How could you not care about it?”

PROVIDENCE, R.I.—In another showdown under the lights, that night-game magic was with Brown on Saturday as it spoiled the hopes of a perfect season for the Harvard football team, which suffered a resounding 29-14 defeat at the hands of the Bears (2-0, 1-0 Ivy). The Crimson (1-1, 0-1) was coming off of a dominant home opener in which it beat Holy Cross, 34-6, inspiring the expectation of an Ivy League championship.
Perhaps it was the overwhelming waves of nearly 18,000 excited Brown fans cheering beneath Brown Stadium’s temporary lights, the automatic foot of freshman kicker Alex Norocea, or the spot-on, aggressive Bears’ defense that made Harvard stumble. But whatever the cause, from the opening drive the Crimson just couldn’t find its rhythm.
It was a night of mistakes for Harvard, which fumbled the ball four times, threw two interceptions, and suffered penalty after penalty, keeping its defense on the field for nearly two-thirds of the game. Brown commanded play from the opening kickoff, putting itself on the board through a field goal by Norocea. The kick, which put the Bears ahead, 3-0, was the first of five successful field goal attempts by the freshman, who tied the school record for field goals in a single game.
“The offense put us in a good position,” the kicker said. “I just went out there and did my job and what I’m expected to do.”
Norocea missed only one attempt during the game on the final scoring opportunity for Brown, a 34-yard kick that went just wide.
The Bears never let up after their first score, widening the gap to 23-0 before the Crimson finally generated enough offense to earn a touchdown seconds before halftime.
The touchdown came off a 21-yard pass from senior quarterback Andrew Hatch—whose commanding offensive presence in the Holy Cross game was smothered by Brown’s stifling defense—to classmate Marco Iannuzzi. The touchdown series took only four plays and less than 30 seconds to complete, showing some of the flair Harvard had possessed against the Crusaders.
The opportunity came from one of the rare mistakes by Brown, which attempted to squib its kickoff to avoid Iannuzzi following one of its own touchdowns. The play went awry as the ball went off the foot of a Crimson up-man and was recovered at the Brown 45.
Immediately following halftime, Iannuzzi struck again, returning the Bears’ kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown that pulled the Crimson within nine. For a moment, it looked as though the one-sided match may turn into a game after all.
“I think we came together as a team on those two plays,” Iannuzzi said of his touchdowns. “A great team effort [on the first touchdown] and then another coming out of halftime. The team was perfect.”
Alas, the perfection lasted for only two short series, a total of 36 seconds, before Brown took over once again, this time never relenting its control over the game.
The Bears pulled down an interception from Hatch—his second on the night—just minutes after the touchdown.
“[Hatch] struggled, we struggled. It’s a team thing,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “You can’t blame it all on the quarterback...we didn’t help him.”
The pick set up Norocea for his fourth field goal of the game, giving Brown a 26-14 lead.
Despite the interceptions, Harvard’s most disastrous play came with three minutes left in the third, when the snap for Crimson punter Jacob Dombrowski went over his head. The sophomore initially recovered the ball, only to fumble it after taking a hard hit from a Bears defender. Brown took control of the ball at Harvard’s 22, allowing for Norocea’s final field goal of the night.
The Harvard defense, anchored by captain Collin Zych, who led all defenders with 12 sacks, did what it could given the amount of time it spent on the field. But the Bears proved too effective at third-down conversions, successfully turning eight of 11 in the opening half alone.
“They did some things that they pretty much do each week, and they did it to us last year,” Brown coach Phil Estes said. “We just tried to take advantage and hope that they gave us the same coverage. We got it and made some plays.”
The Crimson was plagued by penalties, both on offense and defense, giving the Bears yardage while hindering its own.
“We need to become a mentally tougher team,” Murphy said. “That doesn’t mean there’s a gaping hole in that, but the bottom line is that they were the mentally tougher, physically tougher team [Saturday].”
Despite the loss, all hope is not gone for Harvard. Brown beat the Crimson in the 2008 conference opener, and Harvard was able to rally and share the Ivy League title.
Perhaps, like in that season, like in the game against Holy Cross, and like the Bears on Saturday night, Harvard can find its own measure of magic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a clash of the titans on Friday afternoon as the Harvard women’s soccer team visited rival University of Pennsylvania (4-4, 1-0 Ivy) for both squads’ first Ivy League game of the season.
The two teams stepped onto the field with the last three Ivy League championships under their belt: Penn won the title in 2007, and the Crimson claimed the Ancient Eight crown in 2008 and 2009. Each side managed to take the lead twice throughout the match, but it was the Quakers who held on, claiming a 4-3 win.
“It’s a completely different level of play, because we’re all trying to play for one thing, and that’s the Ivy League championship,” rookie goalkeeper Jessica Wright said. “It’s a war, a battle, so it’s completely different than playing a preseason game. [Preseason games are] still a competitive interest, but it’s definitely a completely different thing.”
Knowing that Penn’s previous three wins all came in shutouts, Harvard came out ready to score early and often. Co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh led the charge, taking a pass from junior defender Lindsey Kowal and directing past a defender and into the net just 12 minutes into the game.
“We wanted to score first so that we could shake them off a little bit, to get their heads a little rattled,” Wright said.
The lead quickly disappeared though, as 73 seconds later Wright tried to push a header over the crossbar, letting Quaker junior Ursula Lopez-Palm knock the ball in and knot the score.
At the 22-minute mark Harvard took the lead again, as a pass from Sheeleigh landed on the foot of junior Melanie Baskind. Baskind delivered, hammering a shot past Penn’s junior goaltender Caroline Williams to give Harvard a 2-1 advantage.
But seven minutes later, a pass to Penn junior Marin McDermott turned into a one-on-one between the Quaker forward and Wright. McDermott scored her first goal of the season, evening the score again.
“Our plan was to be consistent,” Baskind said, “to come out with a lot of energy pretty much every game, and I think that we came out slow in the first half. It was nice to get some goals, but I don’t think we were necessarily playing as well.”
The Crimson would never lead again, as Penn sophomore midfielder Erin Beck took a shot from 25 yards out that sailed over Wright’s head, allowing the Quakers to go into the break ahead by one.
Trailing 3-2 in the second half, Sheeleigh and Baskind went on the attack. Standing in front of Williams’ goal, Baskind directed a pass from Sheeleigh into the corner of the net.
The rest of the half ticked down in suspense. Penn looked to have a winner midway through the half, but Wright pushed away the shot from McDermott. The winner eventually did come, as Lopez-Palm blasted a shot from 10 yards out with less than 20 minutes to play, creating chaos on the Quaker bench.
“I thought the score didn’t reflect how the team played,” Wright said. “We fought really hard throughout the game. It was a really rough game.”
Twenty-four total fouls and two yellow cards proved the aggressiveness of the contest. But while Harvard owned an advantage in total shots, shots on goal, and corner kicks, Williams’ seven saves for Penn helped the Quakers hold off the Crimson in the final minutes.
“It’s our first Ivy game, and people felt a lot of pressure to perform,” Baskind said. “It’s definitely frustrating, but I think that it’ll make us better in the weeks to come in terms of gaining preparation and settling down and playing the way that we like to play.”
Though the loss puts Harvard at a disadvantage when Ivy League play resumes against Yale this weekend, the squad knows from experience that wins against every other Ivy school could lead to a third consecutive crown. In the 2008 season, a 2-0 loss to Penn was followed by five Ivy League wins and one tie, which allowed the Crimson to strip the league title from the Quakers and claim a share of the crown.
“The league is very competitive, but I don’t think we’re feeling at all that we’ve dug our own grave,” Baskind said. “I think our goal is to [win the rest of the games] from here. We did it two years ago, and hopefully that will be enough.”
But as Wright said, it will be a challenge at every turn.
“We can still go 6-1 and pull out an Ivy League championship,” she said. “We just need to fight at every game and battle for some wins.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a slow start so far this season, the Harvard women’s soccer team may have found the spark it needs heading into the heart of Ivy League play.
Riding three early scores and a strong performance from freshman goalkeeper Jessica Wright, the Crimson (3-4-1, 0-1 Ivy) snapped a string of losses, coming away with a 3-2 win on the road yesterday against University of Massachusetts (3-6) at Rudd Field.
“I think it was a really good win for us at a crucial part of our season,” co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh said. “I think a lot of things came together today. We’re just going to try to build on them.”
Junior Melanie Baskind scored the critical goal for Harvard late in the first, breaking a 2-2 tie and setting up Wright and the Crimson defense to preserve the victory—only Harvard’s second in its last six games.
UMass attempted four shots on goal in the second half, but Wright—filling in for injured sophomore AJ Millet—deflected them all.
“[Wright] was put in a tight spot,” Baskind said. “She’s stepping up. She’s in there, and she’s confident. She’s filling the hole for us and doing her best, and we’re behind her.”
“She had a really good second half,” Sheeleigh echoed. “I think the relationship with [Wright] and the back line is getting stronger.”
While Wright’s play in net and Harvard’s defense was the story of the second half, offense was not lacking for either team in the first.
The Crimson got off to a hot start, notching two scores in the first 10 minutes to take the early lead.
Harvard failed to capitalize on its first scoring opportunity—a corner kick less than two minutes into the contest—but the team was not denied for much longer.
Sheeleigh found the back of the net in the ninth minute, and freshman Peyton Johnson followed suit just one minute later, giving the visitors the commanding 2-0 lead.
Sheeleigh opened the scoring with her fourth tally of the season, taking a pass from Baskind inside the box and then beating Minutewoman keeper Emily Cota.
Johnson scored Harvard’s second goal without any assistance, firing a shot from 15 yards out that found the bottom left corner of the goal.
But the Crimson’s 2-0 lead proved to be insecure.
After UMass’s first six shot attempts were off their mark, the Minutewomen began to light up the scoreboard.
Therese Smith got the scoring started for the home team in the 18th minute, taking a deep shot that bent past Wright.
Before Harvard could recover, UMass struck again, as Kayla Austin received a pass 20 yards out and then finished with the equalizer in the 22nd minute.
Harvard had two chances to regain the lead shortly thereafter, but an offside call against the Crimson squandered the first opportunity, and a shot from freshman Elizabeth Weisman went wide, keeping the score even.
But Baskind broke the tie in the 31st, finishing a cross from Weisman for her third goal of the weekend.
“Her goal couldn’t have come at a more important time,” Sheeleigh said. “She’s been playing so great and connecting with the other forwards really well.”
But with two-thirds of the game still left to play, it was the Crimson defense’s turn to step up. The back line did its job for the remainder of the first, as UMass registered just one shot in the final 25 minutes of the period.
The second half was a different story, as the Minutewomen had numerous opportunities to score—earning four corner kicks and taking six shots–but were unable to get the ball past Wright.
“I think our back line and our goalkeeper have been under a lot of pressure,” Baskind said. “UMass was very direct, they tend to bring a lot out of you...[But] our defense played well, and it was a good win. Hopefully we can use this moment going into our preparation for Yale next week.”

The Harvard women’s volleyball team traveled to Hanover, N.H., last Friday to face Dartmouth in its first Ivy League match of the season. Though the schedule may have shifted into a new phase, the result was all too familiar for the Crimson. Harvard (2-10, 0-1 Ivy) lost to the Big Green (9-2, 1-0) at Leede Arena in four sets, 25-17, 20-25, 25-16, 25-11, for its seventh straight defeat.
“Going into any Ivy [match], there’s always that extra weight on the game,” junior Christine Wu said. “I think that we just didn’t really show up...Dartmouth played very aggressively, and I don’t think we came out and matched that competitive edge.”
In the first set, the Big Green opened with an early 9-3 lead, forcing the Crimson to burn a timeout. But out of the break, Harvard could not recover. Dartmouth kept up the offensive pressure with kills from junior Madeline Baird and classmate Annie Villanueva to push the score to 13-7. From that point, the Big Green did not falter, winning the opening set, 25-17, on a kill by senior Kelsey Johnson.
“Starting out right away we’ll let the other team get a string of points, and it goes by quickly because we’ll make a few mistakes here and there,” said Wu of the early deficit to open the set. “It’s just a matter of holding on to our serve and chipping away.”
“Once you get behind, it’s mentally a lot tougher to come back,” said junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll.
The second frame offered the Crimson some hope. The two teams traded leads until the middle of the set when a Dartmouth attack error gave Harvard an 11-10 advantage. The Crimson held the lead, 21-19, when a kill from the Big Green freshman Meghan Cooney cut the margin down to one. But sophomore Taylor Docter responded with two straight kills, providing Harvard a little insurance as it went on to claim the set, 25-20.  The win was the first time the Crimson had taken a set in its last 17 tries.
“In the second set, things clicked, our team gelled a bit,” Wu said. “Finally getting a win after such a long time felt great, and hopefully [it] clicks in everyone’s heart that this is what it takes to win.”
“These shining moments show the potential of what we can be,” Wu added.
But Harvard was unable to sustain its momentum. In the third set, Dartmouth came out on fire, quickly building a five-point lead. The Crimson battled back and whittled the lead down to two at 18-16, but with Big Green junior Kendall Houston serving, Dartmouth reeled off five straight points. The Big Green did not allow Harvard another score as it went on to take the set, 25-16.
The final frame played out much like the third, as Dartmouth built an early lead and coasted to a 25-11 win with sophomore Lexie Campbell’s ace icing the match.
On the night, Ingersoll filled out the stat sheet with a team-leading nine kills and four blocks. Freshman Teresa Skelly chipped in seven kills and four blocks, and senior Mikaelle Comrie tallied seven kills as well. As a team, the Crimson was held to just a .097 hitting percentage and committed 23 attack errors.
“Our hitters need to focus a little more on executing and going up every time to hit the ball with a purpose,” Ingersoll said. “We play it safe too much.”
“I know we have so much talent, but now it’s a matter of collecting it all together and getting that on court for an entire match,” Wu said.
Harvard will have a shot at retribution later this week when the Big Green travels to the Malkin Athletic Center for a rematch of last weekend’s contest.
“We get to play [Dartmouth] again on Friday,” Ingersoll said. “I’m really hoping this week that we can take care of the things we need to take care of in order to make our home Ivy opener different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Football teams may have four chances to go 10 yards, but it was the penultimate ones that separated Harvard and Brown Saturday in Providence.
Neither the Crimson nor the Bears were successful on first or second down, forcing both offenses into third-and-long situations. But while Harvard withered at the pressure of long yardage, Brown was able to convert on nearly half its chances, going 8-for-19.
“We don’t design it that way, but we practice third-and-long a lot,” Bears coach Phil Estes said. “It’s kind of a negative thing when you think about it, but it’s one of those situations you find yourself in a lot, and our guys ran some great routes, and our quarterbacks made some great reads.”
On those third downs, Brown took advantage of a Crimson zone defense that frequently left wide receivers open in the secondary. Meanwhile, the Harvard blitz was strong enough to force the Bears’ quarterbacks, Kyle Newhall-Caballero and Joe Springer, out of the pocket, but both signal callers still had plenty of time to escape and find their receivers, who had often been neglected by a Crimson defense that seemed more focused on the line of scrimmage.
“We expected that we were going to get a little more man [coverage], so we had some max protects, and they didn’t [use man],” Estes said. “They actually gave us some cover threes, some cover ones, and we just throw in some curl routes and a dig route, and [the receivers] were there and made some big, big catches and moved the ball pretty effectively.”
Harvard, meanwhile, was unable to match Brown’s performance under pressure and only converted one of its 10 third downs. Unable to establish its ground game, the Crimson offense was forced to rely on senior quarterback Andrew Hatch’s arms and legs to get all of its yardage. Because the Bears were able to limit Hatch’s options, they knew exactly what he was going to attempt on third down plays and were able to stop it.
“We kind of had [Hatch] on the ropes a little bit, guessing where the pressure was coming from,” said Brown senior linebacker Chimso Okoji. “We held him 1-of-10 on third down, which was really big for us. We had first and second down to hold them and then make them go to work on third down, and we were able to do that.”
MONEY IN THE BANK
Some athletes spend a career trying to make school history. It only took Alex Norocea two games. The Bears freshman kicker hit five field goals Saturday night, tying Brown’s school record.
“Alex Norocea is ice for us,” Estes said. “Late in the game, sometimes, that’s the difference.”
There was no such late game drama this year, but perhaps Estes was referring to the teams’ meeting a year ago—a 24-21 Harvard victory—when he chose to attempt the winning touchdown rather than trusting his kicker at the time, Drew Plichta, to make a 42-yard field goal.
This year against the Crimson, Estes didn’t hesitate to use Norocea, including on a 44-yard kick midway through the third quarter.
“What a difference that makes,” Estes said. “It’s a whole different kind of weapon that you’re playing with now...we get inside the 30 or thereabouts, he’s money...we’re still trying to get the first downs, get the drive going, but it really does make a difference to have him to make some big plays for us.”
MARCO POLO
For most of the game, Harvard could not have looked more different than the team that dismantled Holy Cross the week before. But for two plays that sandwiched halftime, the Crimson looked like its old self.
With seven seconds left in the half, Harvard, facing a third-and-10 on Brown’s 21-yard line, made its one third down conversion of the game count when Hatch found senior wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi in the endzone to put the Crimson on the board after nearly 30 minutes of futility.
The next time he got on the field—the opening drive of the second half—Iannuzzi found the endzone again, this time on a 95-yard kickoff return. The senior started heading to the right, where his teammates had begun to set up blocks, then cut across the field where he escaped a Bears defender and ran untouched into the endzone.
“I think we came together as a team on those two plays,” Iannuzzi said. “the team was perfect [on the kickoff]. Anyone could have ran that one right through to the line...It was perfectly schemed and perfectly played out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—In football, the only thing that matters is which team shows up when the first whistle blows.
A week ago, Harvard came out ready to play. Senior quarterback Andrew Hatch sparkled, the defense shut Holy Cross out for nearly 59 minutes, and the Crimson came away with a dominating 34-6 win. Alums started emailing me to ask if Hatch was too good for the Ivy League. In many fans’ minds, the Ancient Eight cup was already polished and sitting in the Harvard trophy case.
Flash forward to Saturday night. The Crimson was once again playing under the lights, but this time in front of a hostile crowd in a game that mattered in the standings. Brown scored on its first possession, Harvard managed to move the ball just 17 yards before punting it away. And from there, things just kept getting worse.
“I can’t remember watching the Harvard football team play like that,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said.
Hatch, who last week looked like an LSU starting quarterback, came crashing down to earth. He finished the game 11-of-23 with two picks, gaining only 128 yards in the air. But Hatch’s ineffectiveness can’t be blamed solely on the quarterback. When he could find an open receiver—which wasn’t often, as the Bears’ defense seemed well-prepared for the Crimson’s passing scheme—the wideouts didn’t always corral catchable passes. And when there was nobody open downfield, Hatch had next to nowhere to go.
Brown’s aggressive defense had no trouble shutting down Harvard’s run game—the second week in a row that the Crimson, which was tops in the Ivy League in rushing last season, hasn’t established itself on the ground. On Saturday, Harvard finished the game with -16 net rushing yards after factoring in sacks and botched snaps.
The Crimson’s trio of running backs—senior Gino Gordon and sophomores Treavor Scales and Rich Zajeski—got a combined eight touches, with Gordon finishing the game with -1 yard on the ground. Scales and Zajeski ended with seven and six yards, respectively, all of which came late in the second half with the contest already all but decided.
But looking at the stat sheet doesn’t answer the fundamental question: what the heck went wrong?
For the most part, it’s not that Harvard is lacking key personnel. Sure, Hatch wasn’t the projected starter at the beginning of the year, but he proved last week that he is more than capable of handling the Crimson offense. The receiving and running back corps are nearly entirely intact from last season. It’s also important to realize that the Bears are a much, much better team than the Holy Cross squad Harvard dismantled last week. The Crusaders went on to lose to Georgetown, 17-7, on Saturday. For a little perspective, the Hoyas were 0-11 last season.
But though Brown does deserve credit, the Crimson was still its own worst enemy on Saturday night. And on the field, there was one unit whose ineffectiveness proved contagious—the offensive line.
The offensive line was the biggest preseason question for Harvard, and it seemed last week that the unit was ahead of expectations. But after its performance in Providence, those questions are pouring back in.
It’s hard to really judge the offensive line’s performance, because it doesn’t accrue any stats. But Hatch’s four sacks, the two botched snaps, and the team’s wimpy 112 yards of total offense speak for themselves. And having senior Brent Osborne, the only returning starter on the line, carted off the field at game’s end with what appeared to be an ankle injury certainly won’t help things.
Murphy had no update on Osborne’s status after the game.
With two weeks gone in the Ivy season, we’ve seen two very different Crimson teams show up. Last week, it was easy to believe in dreams of an undefeated season. This week, it’s easy to assume that the Ivy championship is already out of reach.
“We didn’t play physical enough, we didn’t do a good enough coaching job,” Murphy said. “Bottom line...we got our butts kicked.”
There’s no question that Harvard has put itself in a hole by starting the season with a loss—particularly because Penn, the defending champion, led No. 1 Villanova late in the fourth quarter before falling, 22-10, on Saturday night. But if there’s anything to be learned from the first two weeks of the season, it’s not to make assumptions.
We’ve seen both Jekyll and Hyde from the Crimson thus far. Harvard has a chance to bounce back against a winless Lafayette team on Saturday—it just has to show up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The biggest showdown of Saturday night didn’t take place on a field—it was in the pool.
After dropping its first matchup of the day, the Harvard men’s water polo team came back to play a nail-biting night game that had spectators on the edge of their seats for nearly two hours.
Despite the excitement, the Crimson’s opponents proved too much to handle as Harvard (3-8, 0-2 CWPA North) lost to Fordham (8-7, 2-1), 13-5, before barely falling in sudden-death play to Iona (2-6, 1-1), 11-10, at Blodgett Pool this Saturday.
“It’s disappointing to start our conference play 0-2,” co-captain Bret Voith said. “But I think our team is trying to take the perspective of ‘it happens’, and move forward.”
The tough games tested the entirety of the Crimson’s lineup, and while seniors Alex Thompson, Jeff Lee, and Voith continued to have a powerful presence, a number of other players made their mark as well.
Juniors Kevin DiSilvestro, Mike Katzer, and co-captain Luka Babic, sophomore Max Eliot, and freshman Neal O’Hara all contributed at least one goal to the day’s efforts. Junior goalkeeper Alexandre Popp had 25 saves in the two games, a quarter of his total in the entire 2009-10 season.
“Everybody stepped up,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We have a talented senior class and rely on them, but it’s great to see them get some help.”
IONA 11, HARVARD 10 (4 OT)
In what was the Crimson’s most contentious matchup of the year so far, it took four overtimes to finally get a decision against conference opponent Iona.
The game started off very back-and-forth with the Gaels scoring and Harvard quickly responding. The Crimson never pulled ahead, but Iona had no more than a two-goal lead before halftime.
In the third period, the crossbar stopped a series of Harvard shots, while at the other end of the pool Popp kept the Gaels’ offense at bay. But Iona was able to put away two more goals and was up 8-5 going into the last period of regulation play.
With Popp still making a number of crucial saves, the Crimson offense went to work.
“I think our offense was the best it’s been all year, especially in the second half,” Voith said. “We’ve scored more goals [before], but I think that our offense looked very fluid, and we were breaking their zone very effectively.”
Harvard pulled within one, but couldn’t close the gap until Voith put it in the back of the net to make the score 9-9 with about two minutes to play.
Both teams took timeouts to set up plays in the remaining time, but nothing materialized as the clock hit zero.
In the first of two three-minute overtime halves, the teams’ defenses were the stars, preventing any goals.
It looked like the second overtime period might be scoreless as well until there were less than 40 seconds on the clock. After a drive by the Gael offense, the Crimson’s Popp got possession and, instead of looking for the long pass, took a cross-pool shot that sailed over Iona’s retreating goalkeeper.
The ball hit the water just in front of the goal before bouncing in, putting Harvard up by one.
But with 18 seconds left, the Gaels came back and once again made it a tie game.
Now in the first period of sudden-death overtime, it looked like the Crimson finally had the chance to put away the win. After an Iona foul, Harvard was awarded a penalty shot, but before Voith could take it, the Gaels’ coach was ejected for his loud protestations.
“[The officials] let other things take over, and I think the whole situation killed a bit of our momentum,” Minnis said.
Voith regrouped for the shot, but it wasn’t enough, and Iona’s goalkeeper got in front the ball to keep the Gaels in the game.
Popp similarly came up big for the Crimson, stopping a last-second shot from afar.
“There was a stretch where [Popp] went almost 13 straight minutes without allowing a goal,” Voith said. “Any goalie who can put the team in a position to do that is going above and beyond his role.”
But in the fourth and final overtime, the game was finally decided. After Harvard was unable to capitalize on an early opportunity with a man up, Iona’s offense took it to the other end of the pool and, with 1:03 left on the clock, scored the night’s final goal.
After eight periods of play, the scoreboard read Iona 11, Harvard 10.
FORDHAM 13, HARVARD 5
In the Crimson’s conference opener, Fordham’s offense started strong and wouldn’t slow down.
“Anytime we allow more than 10 goals, we’re not giving ourselves the best opportunity to win,” Minnis said.
The Rams started the scoring early in the first period with a 3-0 run, and Harvard didn’t get on the board until Voith made a penalty shot in the second. Voith and Babic led the team in scores and assists for the game.
With about a minute left before halftime, Fordham was up by four, but after a controversial call against Harvard, the Rams took a shot at the buzzer that just made it past Popp to make the score 7-2.
The second half didn’t look much better for the Crimson, and despite seven saves by freshman goalkeeper Jimmy Field, the Rams continued to stretch the lead, finishing with the 13-5 victory.
The pair of games certainly didn’t have the outcomes Harvard was looking for, but Minnis put it in perspective.
“These are the things that are going to make us stronger and make us better,” he said. “We have to learn to lose the tough ones before we can win them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year’s victory at the 2009 Harvard-Yale dual meet, the first time in two decades that the Harvard’s men’s cross country team won the contest, could have represented a turning point in the storied rivalry.
But the Bulldogs ensured this was not the case, defeating the Crimson on Friday at the Yale Golf Course in New Haven, Conn.
On the women’s side, Harvard finished second in the three-team meet, losing to Princeton and beating Yale for the second year in a row.
“Both teams competed hard, and it was a solid September result for us,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “We still have a lot of work to do, but I’m excited about the rest of the season.”
The men’s squad, ranked ninth in the Northeast region, started off strong in the 97th running of the meet. At the four-mile mark, Harvard held the top three spots in the race. But over the final mile the Crimson began to fade, and eighth-ranked Yale grabbed the second, third, and fourth spots. This surge proved to be enough, as the Bulldogs beat Harvard, 24-34.
“You gotta tip your hat to Yale,” Saretsky said. “They ran tough. They did a better job of executing than we did, and they came away with the victory.”
“We had a plan going in, and we didn’t quite hold onto it, so that kind of got us,” captain Dan Chenoweth said. “[Yale] had a good day as well.”
The team’s failure to execute and inability to hold onto the second and third spots can partly be attributed to inexperience.
In fact, five of the Crimson’s top seven runners in the contest were freshmen.
Chenoweth’s performance was the lone bright spot for Harvard. For the second time in as many years, the senior captain won the dual meet, and his time of 25:10.70 broke both the course and meet records.
The Lowell House resident clobbered the competition, finishing nearly 25 seconds before the closest competitor.
“[Chenoweth] is obviously in great shape,” Saretsky said, calling his performance “very, very impressive.”
On the women’s end, the Crimson fared much better. Despite losing to the Tigers by 18 points, Harvard handled Yale, beating the Bulldogs by 28 points in the 34th Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet.
“We beat Yale, which is awesome—pretty easily, actually,” senior captain Eliza Ives said.
The Crimson benefitted from a number of strong performances. In fact, Harvard finished with four runners in the top 10 overall.
“Overall, they ran smart,” Saretsky said of the team. “I was just really pleased with the effort.”
Junior Jeanne Mack delivered one of the Crimson’s best performances, finishing fifth overall.
While the result in itself is laudable, Mack’s difficult journey back to running makes her finish that much more impressive.
“She had a lot of injuries freshman year, so her sophomore year she was sort of getting back into the swing of things, and then this year she’s really been training incredibly hard,” Ives said. “She had an amazing race.”
Nevertheless, senior Claire Richardson had the performance of the afternoon for Harvard, missing first place by only six seconds. She and Princeton senior Sarah Cummings, the overall winner, pulled away from the pack, with 14 seconds separating Richardson from the third-place finisher.
“I went ahead of [Cummings] with, I don’t know, a little less than a mile to go,” Richardson said. “I think what it comes down to is I just have to focus on finishing the race.”
Richardson and Cummings, both seniors, have established a rivalry over their three years competing against one another.
“I know that [Richardson] is excited to get out there and get a chance to beat [Cummings],” Ives said.
The Crimson’s performance against the Tigers this year marks a radical departure from the HYP meet two years ago.
In the 2008 contest, Princeton dominated, claiming the top six spots.
Despite losing again this time around, the marked improvement in performance is a good sign. The fact that Harvard, ranked fourth in the Northeast region, could keep up with the Tigers, ranked ninth nationally, bodes well for the team.
“This year we really mixed it up with Princeton for the first time in a couple years,” Ives said.
“That we can keep up with Princeton...was encouraging and exciting,” Richardson said. “This meet gives us a lot to work towards.”

Stepping onto the court for the first time this season, the Harvard men’s tennis team took advantage of the weekend to shake the rust off.
The Northeast Invitational, an individual tournament held in Flushing, N.Y., had its ups and downs.
“The team battled hard, but it was apparent that we’re all a little rusty,” captain Aba Omodele-Lucien said. “But these are just building blocks. We’re going to use this as a step to go to the next level.”
Omodele-Lucien led the team with a 4-0 record, winning his flight in singles and partnering up with sophomore Joshua Tchan to reach the final in his doubles flight. Also notable were sophomore Andy Nguyen, who went 2-1 on the day, and junior Mac McAnulty, who reached the semifinals of his singles flight.
On the doubles side, Crimson juniors Davis Mangham and Jonathan Pearlman made the finals of their flight, while junior Alistair Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen teamed up to reach the semifinals.
“I think it went well for us, although I think everyone came away with a good idea of what they need to work on,” Felton said. Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 placed Tchan, Pearlman, and sophomore Christo Schultz in the A singles flight, while Nguyen and Felton were in the B flight.  Omodele-Lucien was the sole Crimson competitor in C.
Harvard sent two teams to the A flight in doubles, Omodele-Lucien/Tchan and Felton/Nguyen. Mangham/Pearlman played in the B flight.
The invitational kicked off a series of individual tournaments for the tennis team this fall in preparation for Ancient Eight competition in the spring.
“The Ivy season and the spring as a whole are a lot more important than the fall,” Felton said. “We’re trying to set ourselves up for the spring.”
The tournaments have a different feel, though.
“Playing in individual tournaments is much different,” Omodele-Lucien said. “There’s a possibility of playing four matches or more on your own. You’re playing mostly for yourself, while in the dual match, every match counts.”
The invitational also served as the first college tennis match for the freshmen, as well as the first match in a Harvard uniform for junior transfer Jonathan Pearlman, who began his collegiate career at Brown. According to Omodele-Lucien, the team was impressed with the performance of the new players.
“There’s a lot of things to work on, but we have a lot of potential—we can do really well,” the captain said.
The Crimson looks to use matches like these to gain real match experience, as well as expose target areas for improvement.
“You can’t really recreate a match situation in practice,” Felton said. “[I realized] I have to work on the depth of my shots and my tactics a bit more than others. I felt not totally in control of my game, finding my feet again.”
Felton lost his first two matches but rebounded to win the last two. Harvard will take to the courts again next weekend, this time in Allston for The Chowder Fest tournament.
“I felt better each game,” Felton said. “I think we’ll do a lot better [next weekend].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once again, Brian Rogers refused to give up.
Standing 15 feet away from the net in the right center of the box, with the seconds ticking off the clock, he saw the ball deflect off a defender and land at his feet. Taking position, the sophomore forward aimed and fired.
The ball zipped past diving Stony Brook goalie Stefan Manz, and just like that, in the 90th minute, the game was tied.
It was not the first time Rogers had the flair for the dramatic this season, but his goal gave his struggling No. 21 Harvard men’s soccer team—winless in its previous three contests—a much-needed boost and propelled it to a 1-1 tie at LaVelle Stadium Friday night.
“Once they scored I just kept telling myself I would get at least one good opportunity,” Rogers said. “That opportunity just happened to come with 30 seconds left. I saw the ball, and I just tried to get it on frame, and luckily it went in.”
After getting the start over junior Austin Harms, sophomore Brett Conrad was solid in net for Harvard, making three saves in the contest.
“Coach [Carl] Junot highlighted a couple of games where I would get the opportunity to come in and show I could help the team,” Conrad said. “It was an interesting game to come into first game of the season, but I definitely think I held my own, showed the team some good stuff, and overall it was a good performance.”
Neither goalie faced much pressure in the first half, with Stony Brook controlling the tempo and outshooting Harvard, 3-2.
Conrad had the only save in the period, stopping a header off a free kick by Seawolf midfielder Mame Samb at the 17:39 mark.
After Crimson sophomore defender Richard Smith committed a foul later in the first half, a direct kick by Stony Brook midfielder Mihailo Pavlisin sailed over the net.
Early in the second half, the Seawolves applied pressure early. Forward Berian Gobeil Cruz got tangled up one-on-one with Conrad, who tripped Cruz, setting up a penalty kick.
Cruz’s ensuing shot beat Conrad to the right, putting Stony Brook up, 1-0, in the 49th minute. It was the fourth goal out of seven allowed this season for Harvard that came on a free kick or penalty kick.
“I think after we went down a goal, we kind of lost our way a little bit,” Rogers said. “It looked like people were losing confidence. We were a bit scrambled.”
Conrad nonetheless kept his team in the game as the second half played on, making saves off of shot attempts by Seawolf midfielder Leonardo Fernandes in the 69th and 83rd minutes.
With its back against the wall in the final minutes of the game, the Harvard offense finally began to pick up. Junior midfielder Jamie Rees had a shot go over the bar at 88:22, but exactly one minute later, Rogers’ third goal of the season sent the game into overtime.
“I think that goal gave us the confidence that we carried over to OT,” Rogers said. “It shows us that even if the other team scores first, we have the players and the talent to come back and score.”
The Crimson kept up the pressure at the start of the first extra session. After three shots were blocked by the Stony Brook defense, sophomore forward Zack Wolfenzon was able to manage an attempt on goal, but Manz made the save at 99:37.
Harvard nearly won the game in the second overtime period, when Rogers took a kick from the far corner and headed it on goal, but Manz made a fantastic diving save to his left at 101:25. Neither team was able to manage a shot on net the rest of the extra session, and the Crimson ended up with its second consecutive draw against an unranked team.
“I think everyone would rather win these games,” Rogers said. “But the beginning of the year, up until we start our Ivy season, is really just a learning process. We have a young team, and we’re all still getting to know how each other plays.”
Rogers also said he would like to see the pressure the team was able to apply at the end of the second half and in overtime maintained throughout the whole game.
“I think it comes with confidence,” he said. “We have to not be afraid to make mistakes going forward, not play people defensively...you have to take chances in order to score and in order to win.”
The Crimson was outshot, 14-11, and had two corner kicks to Stony Brook’s six, but the squad was still content with the result and the dramatics it brought.
“Games like this always help with preparation,” Conrad said. “I think we’re gaining a lot of experience; there were a lot of positives to come out of that game.”

In a slump, it sometimes helps to just play worse teams.
Harvard field hockey ended its five-game losing streak on Saturday, defeating Penn on the road, 2-0. The victory was the Crimson’s first since Sept. 6. With the away win, its first of the year, Harvard improved to 3-5, including a 1-1 record in Ivy League competition. The loss was the fourth in a row for the Quakers (1-5, 0-2).
Neither team had many scoring chances in the game. The Crimson managed eight shots, including just three in the second half, to Penn’s seven. But of these attempts, Harvard converted on two of the three shots on goal.
“Eight isn’t a particularly high number, but a 25 percent conversion is pretty good, so I think we’re pretty happy,” sophomore Kim Goh said.
Both of the Crimson’s goals came from two of the team’s three penalty corners, an improvement in an area where the team has struggled for much of the year. Junior Georgia McGillivray scored the first late in the first half, and Harvard padded its lead with a goal from junior caption Carly Dickson in the 41st minute.
“Our big focus and one of our goals was to force a lot of corners, and we converted off of them, which was nice to see,” senior Chloe Keating said. “We kept the lead in the first half, we built on it in the second, and we didn’t shut down at all.”
The Crimson had not scored two or more goals since its last win in early September. The box score from Saturday’s game still looks sparse—only three people took more than two shots, and no one had more than one shot on goal. But even though the offense was not prolific, the team was able to get on the board early, something it had not been able to do during its recent struggles.
“We’ve traditionally been very good at working the ball from the back to the midfield, and now we’re getting on the same page as far as attacking the goal cage,” Goh said.
But in the shutout, the defense was the strongest part of Harvard’s game.
“We just didn’t have any breakdowns,” Keating said. “Typically, we play one great half or we let down for 10 to 15 minutes, and during that time, the opposing team will capitalize, but we didn’t have that this game, which is really nice.”
Throughout the Crimson’s five-game losing streak, the defensive end still ran smoothly.
Two of the losses were 1-0 defeats, and the team never allowed more than four goals in the span.
In Saturday’s game, Penn could only match Harvard’s three shots on goal.
“The defense...played really smart,” Keating said. “They didn’t let anything get by them that shouldn’t have gotten by them, and they were communicating really well and recovering really well. They just didn’t give Penn any opportunities to really capitalize off of anything.”
Sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos has not allowed more than four goals in a game since last November, when she gave up five against New Hampshire. She has a .774 save percentage this year.
On Saturday, all three of her saves came in the second half.
Both Keating and Goh also emphasized the tough transition to the different playing surface at Penn. The Crimson plays its home games on turf at Jordan Field.
“Playing on a different field condition away—sometimes that stuff can interfere with us playing our game, but we really executed well and had a great outcome,” Goh said.
The win, even against a weak Ivy League opponent in the Quakers, is a welcome change for a team that had not held the lead in any of its five consecutive losses.
“I think what we showed in our game today was persistence to execute the game plan and support each other all around the field,” Goh said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—The latest “road” game for the No. 20 Harvard men’s soccer team, a 20-minute bus ride away, turned out to be a disappointing finish to a mediocre five-game road trip.
The Crimson (2-2-3) visited Boston University (5-3-1) last night in hopes of adding a victory to its otherwise winless campaign on the road. Instead, a lackluster first half that ended tied at one—thanks to a beautifully-taken free kick by freshman Kyle Henderson to end the period—only led to a second half filled with heavy touches and incomplete passes. The unranked Terriers took advantage of the sloppy play to put the game away, 2-1.
“[BU’s second score] was a well-constructed goal on their part,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “It was a good finish and a good cross, and after that we ran out of a little energy. I think five games into a road swing we’ve run out of road energy. I think if you had told me that we would come out of a five-game road swing with two losses, I would’ve said that’s probably pretty good.”
The Terriers had a plethora of opportunities throughout the game, starting with a very close shot in the 27th minute that went wide just past the right post on a counterattack that caught junior goalkeeper Austin Harms out of the goal.
Harvard showed sparks of ingenuity as well. Junior midfielder Jamie Rees, freed up by the constant double- or even triple-teaming on sophomore Brian Rogers, often tormented the Terriers’ left flank but failed to find the back of the net.
In the 23rd minute, Rees went one-on-one against a Boston leftback and was purposefully tripped up after successfully slipping the ball through the legs of his opponent. This foul led to the first set piece for the visiting team, but it was a wasted opportunity as the ball crashed into a two-man wall.
Throughout the game, set pieces were a major weakness for the Crimson, which often failed to get the ball past the wall or lost possession.
With 18 minutes left in the first half, the host’s constant attempts on the right flank finally came to fruition when the Terriers’ Ben Berube kicked in a cross to an unmarked Kelvin Madzongwe.
The freshman calmly jumped into the air and carefully headed the ball into the goal—the first tally of his career. Harms helplessly watched the ball roll past his right, and BU went up on the scoreboard.
Falling behind is now becoming a pattern for Harvard, a team that had to rely on an 89th–minute goal from Rogers against Stony Brook on Friday to salvage a tie. This time around, the Crimson banked on a freshman to level the score.
With just two minutes left in the first half, Henderson bent a free kick into the top left corner of the net, scoring his first collegiate goal. It was the only shot on goal for Harvard, compared to the Terriers’ four.
The second half began with the characteristic exchange of touches from both teams, with the Crimson coming up with a few opportunities but failing to test Terrier goalkeeper Brandon Briggs.
Rees, causing trouble for the left side of the Terriers’ backline, had a clear chance to put his team ahead with 38 minutes left in the half, thanks to a pass from senior Alex Chi, but Briggs sacrificed his body to secure the ball.
Five minutes later, just as the momentum seemed to be on Harvard’s side, a crafty sequence of passes by the BU frontline led to an easy put-in by Berube.
Aaron O’Neal, from the right side, crossed a dangerous pass through the penalty box to a rushing Vicente Colmenares, who passed the ball back to the middle, where Berube ran to meet it. Harms, preoccupied by Colmenares, failed to get back in time to the middle section of the goal, where Berube rolled the ball right in.
After the second goal, the fatigue wore on Harvard, and it was only in the final minutes of the game that the Crimson felt a sense of urgency to find another tying goal, primarily from its lone striker.
Unfortunately, Rogers was largely ineffective, as he was heavily marked by a resilient backline. It was up to the wings to come up with plays, but nothing gave a positive result for Harvard.
“We have the guys that can step up and help me out, but it’s going to take some time,” Rogers said. “It’s just a matter of figuring out how they’re going to impact the game. I think we’re asking guys to step up who haven’t had to in the past, and it takes everyone a few games, a few weeks to adjust.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Foxboro Stadium to take on the New England Patriots yesterday afternoon, the Buffalo Bills had struggled to put points on the board. Through the first two games of the season under quarterback Trent Edwards, the team averaged a league-low 8.5 points per game, granting them the title of the NFL’s least productive offense.
Enter former Harvard quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.
Last season, while competing with Edwards for the starting quarterback job, Fitzpatrick went 127 for 227, throwing for 1,422 yards with nine touchdowns and ten interceptions. Head coach Chan Gailey hoped that giving the nod to Fitzpatrick would provide a desperately needed offensive spark, and Fitzpatrick proved to be just what the doctor ordered.
In just one game, Fitzpatrick surpassed the total offensive output of Buffalo’s first two games, completing 20 for 28 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns. He kept the Bills close until the fourth quarter, but was intercepted twice, including one by Brandon Meriweather that sealed the deal in New England’s favor.
Even though Buffalo has gone winless through the first three games of the 2010 season and has lost the last 14 meetings with the Patriots, the Bills have to feel pleased with the improvement in offensive production. In fact, Edwards was released earlier today by the Bills, a sign that Gailey has officially handed the starting quarterback duties over to Fitzpatrick.
With more success in the red zone, the Bills should be able to best their 7-9 record from a year ago and an ignited offense led by Fitzpatrick could very well make the AFC East race this season a very competitive one up until the very end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten more savvy—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
To say that Week 2 of Harvard’s football season didn’t go quite as smoothly as Week 1 is, well, a gross understatement. After his team was embarrassed in a 29-14 loss that was much more lopsided than the scoreboard indicated, Crimson coach Tim Murphy had to do his best to explain what happened. Murphy tips his hat to Brown and shoulders most of the blame himself in this week’s edition of Sound Off.
What Murphy said: “We’re a team that’s usually played pretty well with our backs to the wall. So we go bang-bang on those big plays at the end of the [first] half and the beginning of the second half—we were right in it. But we just never were consistently mounting anything on offense...and then [when] you throw interceptions, you’re putting your defense in a bind.”
 
What Murphy meant: When senior Marco Iannuzzi scored his second of two touchdowns on a 95-yard kickoff return to open the second half, the Crimson was nine points back with nearly 30 minutes to play and all the momentum on its side. Harvard has made tough comebacks before—most recently in its last Ivy contest, last November’s matchup with Yale, when it scored two touchdowns in the last seven minutes to take The Game. This time, the Crimson forced a three-and-out on Brown’s first possession, but senior quarterback Andrew Hatch quickly threw a pick in his first play from scrimmage. As Murphy points out, it’s hard to win football games when you’re making those kinds of rally-killing mistakes on offense. 
What Murphy said: “We’ve got to be a more balanced offense, we’ve got to be able to run the football. If you’re not able to run the football, then teams are going to be able to tee off on you and make you play one dimension.”
 
What Murphy meant: Harvard hasn’t really been able to establish its run game at all this season, something that’s hard to attribute to the tandem of senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales, two of the most talented tailbacks in the league. What it comes down to is that the Crimson just hasn’t delivered the blocks Gordon and Scales need to bring the ball downfield. Harvard thrived last year because it was able to get both parts of its offense going, and that’s one of the biggest fixes that needs to be made before the Crimson faces its next conference opponent.
 
What Murphy said: “We didn’t play physical enough, we didn’t do a good enough coaching job, and bottom line, like I said, we got our butts kicked.”
 
What Murphy meant: Murphy’s been the head coach of Harvard football for 17 years, and he has some remarkable accomplishments in his tenure—including five Ivy titles, two perfect season, and 105 victories. Saturday night’s game was not one for his career scrapbook. The offense’s inability to get anything going is certainly partly attributable to both Brown’s aggressive defense and the Harvard players’ frustration, but Murphy rightly shouldered the blame in this one for a poorly-executed offensive scheme. Hatch had nobody to pass to because the Bears knew exactly where the receivers were going to be on nearly every play. Brown coach Phil Estes even admitted in his postgame comments that the coverage his team saw on Saturday was pretty much the same as what the Crimson showed in a win over the Bears last year.

As you may have heard, the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies recently decided to inaugurate a $650,000 fund in honor of New Republic editor and former Harvard professor Martin "Marty" Peretz. Unfortunately, Peretz is currently infamous for asserting (in this blog post) that Muslim life is "cheap, most notably to Muslims." Although students and faculty have spoken out against Peretz, the Social Studies department officially announced the acceptance of the fund at its 50th anniversary celebration on Saturday, honoring Peretz as planned.
But the fight wasn't over. A group of students protested against Peretz at the event and then made this video. Watch the "Party for Marty," then read more about it in tomorrow's issue of The Crimson.

UPDATED: 3:44 p.m.
The fire alarms in Memorial Hall sounded at around 11:40 a.m. today, leading to an evacuation of the building.
Interrupting a lecture of Ethical Reasoning 22: "Justice," the sounding of the alarms was not a prank, according to Tina Bowen, a production manager at the Office of the Arts who works at Memorial Hall.
“I was so thrilled to see the use of the emergency exits [in Sanders Theatre]," she said. "I came into the theater to encourage people to use them, and everyone already was.” Students had also evacuated from Annenberg and the Loker Commons.
Raymond Traietti, the assistant director and building manager for Memorial Hall, told us that the alarm had been triggered in the Annenberg kitchen, but the Cambridge Fire Department found no actual fires. (We thought that was smoke in the photo, too, but it must have been something else. Steam from the sprinklers, perhaps?)
Traietti told us that fire alarms go off in Memorial Hall approximately four or five times per year. "There are such an intense array of suppression systems, and it is so complicated, that you are bound to get mishaps," he said.
Fires are of special concern to Memorial Hall staff because the building suffered significant structural damage from a 1957 fire.
The all-clear was given a few minutes after noon, when everyone was allowed to reenter the building.

Currier, Dunster, Kirkland, and Winthrop dining halls will be closed for the Columbus Day holiday.
In an e-mail, HUHDS spokeswoman Crista Martin characterized the temporary closure of the dining halls as financially motivated.
"Annually we examine student participation in the dining program, especially around holidays, and work in conjunction with the College to identify periods of reduced use/participation and, as appropriate, close dining halls in an effort to be fiscally responsible at a time of continued financial constraints," she wrote.
