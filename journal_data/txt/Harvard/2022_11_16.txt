After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
1. When we found out I was going to Harvard for college, the first thing my mother made me do was learn how to cook salmon miso soup. “You’re going to be so sad in America without good Asian food,” she fretted. What my mother cobbled together in 10 minutes everyday took me an hour if I was lucky, and even then it was never quite right — the perfect ratio of white and dark miso eluded me. I was too heavy handed on the mirin; the salmon would disintegrate slightly as it boiled. For a week, my family was forced to eat whatever mutated version of the salmon miso soup I churned out for dinner, hurling good-natured insults and feedback my way.
Fast forward three months, and I have not yet made salmon miso soup in college — the recipe is pretty much erased from my memory. But late one Sunday night, I find myself frying up gyoza (courtesy of H-Mart!) with friends, all of them making jokes about the charred dumplings I was serving up, and even halfway around the world it feels like I’m right back home with my family. Perhaps it never was about the food, but rather, the act of creating something with others.

2. Eba smelled like garlic. Not the sour smell people unfamiliar with the flavor may think. But sweet, complex, melancholic.
Abuela Eba smelled clean. Of freshly picked tomatoes from her garden, or the persimmons Ebo grew outside. She smelled of oranges and lemons, of lacón con papa, of café con leche, of flan, of cinnamon and bay leaf.
Though her family once operated a world famous restaurant, Eba was severed from her home when she left Havana post-revolution. Food became her language to enliven memories, nourish our roots, and express her soul.
During el Día de Gracias or la Nochebuena, she’d spend over 48 hours cooking her most beloved meals of platanos, congrí, yucca, and the showstopper: the 20-pound turkey in her adored mojo crudo – a marinade of garlic, citrus, onion, and spices. Coming home meant walking into a kitchen full of Eba, of her radiance, protection, and love she captured onto every plate she served.

3. Porridge is perhaps one of the most lamented foods in human existence. Made from the dredges of harvest, its watered-down cousin served in pitiful portions to a certain Victorian child, porridge has only recently been recognized for its breakfast potential yet has been long known for its soupy nothingness.
But I was raised in appreciation of a morning bowl of porridge, which on a cold winter day is like being embraced from the inside by the heat of an open oven and in the summer leaves your cheeks flushed. My mom makes it in a rice cooker (the wonders of technological innovation!), combining a bird’s nest of lotus seeds and millet to white and black rice that turns the mixture purple. The night before I’ll watch her measure and soak the beans in water, so that come morning they’ll be ready for cooking. Its preparation is a ritualistic endeavor steeped in love and fiber content.

4. When my grandma cuts mango, it’s a public event.
Sharp knife. Tight grip. Crows feet exposed. Her butt-length white locs migrate into the folds of her signature turban, cautious of how far the stray juices may spread.
In Trinidad, mangoes come to you. They fall off of trees, begging to be eaten before they rot. They are almost desperate in their ripeness. That’s why it’s not my fault when I chase mango with mango, eating so many that my stomach swells and going for a walk seems simultaneously necessary and impossible. Their sweetness reminds me of my homes; My grandma’s Jamaica, my grandpa’s Trinidad, and my very own Sunshine State (where the mangoes know to keep one peel open when I come around).
— Anya L. Henry ‘24
5. I came home one afternoon to my mom’s new culinary endeavor: Thai larb, the recipe foraged from a food magazine. The glossy torn page boasting the instructions enjoyed a post-meal induction into the hallowed recipe book that night – a worn binder struggling to contain the cacophony of recipes which concocted my taste of childhood.
With a resounding snap of the binder rings, larb became officially recognized as a staple of our kitchen. But the three binder holes soon tugged tears in the tired recipe, and the cooking stains the paper amassed with use coalesced into a potent garlicky aura. I, too, grew weary of the recipe’s frequent use, protesting whenever I detected the minty spice omen of larb. No, my 16-year-old self likely wouldn’t name it as a favorite dish, but I now long for the masterfully-prepared constant of larb which defined a culinary manifestation of home and love.
— Marin E. Gray ‘26
6. With Thanksgiving creeping nearer and nearer, and Annenberg dinner getting less and less bearable, the literal art that’s cooked by my grandma and her sisters, passed down from generation to generation, has been taunting me. These foods, while seemingly simple, are infused with flavor and a culture borrowed from around the world. With my entire family originating from Charleston, low country cuisine and soul food is served at every get together.
My favorite dish is red rice, which is usually a side dish made with tomatoes, sausage, peppers, and bacon. I also enjoy frogmore stew, also known as a seafood boil, sweet potato pie, okra, and “Hoppin Johns,” a rice and bean dish. While these dishes are enjoyed by many today, they originate from ancestors who through slavery, abuse, and oppression held tight to their identities and cooked a testment of their strength and love that could never be taken.
— Makayla Gathers ‘26
7. When I trudge through late-night assignments, dumplings are there to keep me going. When I had just moved into college and was terrified to enter Annenberg without the hordes of friends everyone seemed to already possess, they waited for me in my dorm freezer. Even in high school, when I developed a stress-induced aversion to most of the foods that my mom eagerly presented to me, Trader Joe’s frozen soup dumplings were my warm, plump allies, ready to burst with soothing broth and requiring nothing of me but a two-minute trip to the microwave.
Give these bundles of pork, ginger, and pure comfort a try next time you sift through the Trader Joe’s freezers. It seems almost cliche that my Wasian self is promoting xiao long bao, a Chinese classic, from a granola American grocery store — but maybe that’s exactly why these soup dumplings have always felt like home to me.
— Stella A. Gilbert ‘26
8. Nattō
The way it sticks to my chopsticks and leaves its slime on the sides of my hands.
The way there are always a few styrofoam packs of it at the bottom of the freezer.
The way my mom makes it for dinner when she’s a bit too tired to cook.
The way my dad can’t stand its pungent aroma and refuses to walk into any room where the smell lingers.
The way my brother can’t eat it without leaving sticky grains of rice all over the table.
The way I can taste the Earth in every bitter bite.
How could it not feel like home?
— Najya S. Gause ‘26

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tale we tell about low-income students at Harvard is simple and affecting. It’s also mostly inaccurate.
The narrative goes something like this: An inner-city kid from an underfunded high school — through a combination of intelligence, ambition, and luck — manages to become a competitive candidate for admission. The American Dream succeeds and Gatsby reaches his green light. But immediately after Harvard accepts the student, they experience acute culture shock. They aren’t used to being around wealthy peers, participating in conversations about luxurious summer vacations, and don’t know what being a “consultant” even means. College, in both academic and social contexts, is alienating. Thus, we push Harvard to provide ample resources for low-income and first-gen students to make this transition a little more bearable.
As familiar as this narrative may seem, it is wholly deceptive. The anomalous truth is that many low-income students on campus experience no culture shock at all. Anthony A. Jack, an assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, refers to these students as the “privileged poor.” This oxymoron describes low-income students who attended wealthy, private high schools and boarding schools on scholarship. Although the privileged poor lack economic resources at home, Jack believes they acquire immense social capital at these elite high schools. The privileged poor learn unspoken skills, like attending office hours to earn higher grades — skills that students from underfunded high schools cannot learn before college. When the privileged poor arrive at the gates of Harvard they are fully prepared for the incoming wave of competition and affluence.
According to research in Jack’s recent book, half of the low-income students at elite universities come from wealthy high schools — the types of schools that act as Ivy League pipelines. Our simple tale about low-income students at prestigious universities fails to account for the experiences of the privileged poor, who come into college with the subtle skills needed to navigate a rigorous academic and pre-professional social environment.
The abundance of the privileged poor on campus is far from a coincidence. From an institutional perspective, these students are a “safer bet.” Low-income students from wealthy high schools will have an easier time maintaining Harvard’s inflated GPA from the moment they step on campus. By accepting the privileged poor, Harvard is able to display its socioeconomic diversity without having to worry about low-income students transitioning to elite spaces for the first time. Recruiting the privileged poor is also the easiest way to get socioeconomic diversity — admissions officers have to look no further than ordinary feeder schools. All incentives point to the privileged poor being the preferred low-income students on campus.
While it is important to call on Harvard to expand its recruitment to underfunded high schools, the reality is that the privileged poor will continue to make up a large percentage of the low-income student body. Our current process of addressing socioeconomic barriers is wholesale, blunt, and not tailored to this material truth. Resources such as the Harvard First Generation Program and Harvard Primus tailor their programs to all low-income and first-gen students, without distinction. While Harvard should absolutely foster community among these groups, special attention needs to be paid to those who don’t fit under the privileged poor label. Low-income students that did not attend elite high schools deserve extra attention.
I attended Cambridge Rindge & Latin high school, an extremely well-funded public school — this gave me ample opportunity to prepare for college. I went to office hours, practiced writing extensive essays, and learned how to study for finals. Thus, being part of the first-gen community on campus is still highly rewarding, but I’m not the type of student who needs a lot of extra support navigating elite academic spaces.
Harvard should make active efforts to identify which low-income students attended substandard high schools: Such students merit higher investment, recognition and support. Treating and talking about low-income students as a monolith misses the mark from many different angles. It underestimates the preparedness of the privileged poor while, most importantly, risks taking away resources from low-income students that don’t happen to be a part of the privileged poor. It might be too expensive, for example, to provide an extra one-on-one counselor for all low-income first-year students. However, this policy seems to be within reach if low-income students from underfunded high schools are its isolated recipients.
These distinctions — the nuances of privilege and access to resources within low-income groups — matter. Only by recognizing that low-income students are not a uniform group can we open up the door to meaningful improvement and greater equity.

I’ve been in a really good place with my reading lately.
By a “really good place,” I mean that I’ve actually been picking up books and voluntarily reading them. Many college students — especially those majoring in the humanities like I am — will know what I’m talking about. When you spend the whole day reading verbose academic articles and heavy literature, it can be hard to find the motivation to pick up yet another book at the end of the day. It’s tempting to just scroll through TikTok for an hour instead or to rewatch that comfort sitcom for the 40th time.
But this semester, I’ve been reading — genuinely, truly, reading — in my spare time.
Before you get the wrong idea, let me be perfectly clear. I’m not reading books that you’d write an essay on. Rather, I’ve been reading books with titles like “Classified as Murder” and “The Quiche of Death.”
Yes, I’ve been reading “lowbrow” novels, specifically those of the “cozy mystery” variety. At this point, you might be thinking: So what? But for me, this is a significant change. It’s not just the fact that I’m reading these kinds of books; it’s also that I’m talking about reading these kinds of books. Instead of snatching quick, guilty chapters here and there, or rambling for ages trying to justify my choice of reading material to my confused friends, I’ve been more confident — and defiant — about how I choose to spend my time. It’s all part of my recent efforts to wholeheartedly embrace the so-called “bad art” in the world, and to unlearn the biases that have been drilled into me from time immemorial.
I started this column because sometimes, being a literature concentrator is bewildering. We occupy a weird space wherein our chosen area of study — art — is both the most and least accessible discipline. On the one hand, everyone consumes art every single day. Everyone reads; everyone watches films and TV, and everyone has an opinion on what they see and consume. There is no barrier to entry for art (or at least, there shouldn’t be).
At the same time, the way art is studied at a higher level is nowhere near what you would call easily approachable. It’s not just a matter of sitting down and writing what you think about books; at least, not at first. Like any other formal discipline, in the beginning, there are endless layers of high-level theory, specialized language, and dense, challenging concepts to learn. All this means that an interesting phenomenon occurs: your taste as a human (what do I like to read and watch?) is developed at the same time as your taste as a scholar (what do I like to critically read and watch?)
This is fine, for the most part — there’s bound to be a natural overlap between the two. But they can never be perfectly harmonious, and because the scholar’s tastes will often shame the human’s tastes, it becomes very hard to have a healthy relationship with art, especially “bad” art. When all of our class time is spent with a rigid definition of what constitutes “good” art that is worthy of study, the pressure to have good taste tends to leak beyond the academic setting. When English professors make small talk and ask you what you’ve been reading lately, for example, they expect to hear a title that’s been reviewed by The New York Times, not something with a “BookTok Approved!” sticker on the front page. Similarly, when you tell people you’ve been trying your hand at writing, everyone expects you to be working on Serious Fiction, not a story about sword fights or space pirates. In short, for us humanities majors, a constant battle between the scholar and human occurs, wherein there’s an overwhelming amount of pressure for the scholar to swallow up the human completely.
But the problem is, no one can be a scholar all the time.
The thing that my literature concentration made me forget is that art is not just my academic bread and butter, but my source of healing and entertainment. As I get older, and think more critically about what and how I consume, it’s become more important than ever to remember to keep the two categories equal. To be okay with loving tales of quiche-themed murders or secret magical investigations in London as much as I love deeply complex, “thinky” reflections on the human spirit.
It hasn't been a straightforward path to get here. I’ve abandoned my principles and regressed to snooty gatekeeping and pooh-poohing of “lowbrow” art on many occasions. Interestingly, these were also the times when I was reading the least; when I was the least relaxed; and when I was the most miserable.
So, to end, a note to all my fellow arts concentrators: Take a step back. Don’t trick and guilt yourself out of honest enjoyment and fun. Pick up that military space opera novel, that murder mystery set in a cat cafe, or that romance graphic novel about two polite British teenagers.
And the next time someone asks you what you’ve been reading lately, don't scramble for the last Booker-nominated title that the scholar in you hobbled through. Instead, let the human in you answer — and don’t forget to hold your head up high as you do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve spent 16 years of my life trying to become a United States citizen.
I spent those years as a visa holder, as a permanent resident (green card) holder, and as an applicant for Naturalization. Finally, in 2022, I am proudly an American citizen. I am a proud Missourian. I am part of the United States of America.
My family and I have waited for a decade and a half to be able to say, “I’m an American,” or “Soy Americano.” When my mom received her U.S. citizenship, she couldn’t stop saying that she was American to us while our applications were still being processed. The joy and relief that came over my mom, my dad, and me when we received our Interview and Ceremony letters dissipated years of anxiousness. It indicated the end of our American imposter syndrome. The moment we had our hands on the red, white, and blue piece of paper that welcomed us to the citizenry, no one would be able to call us less than true Americans. No one could tell us to go back to our country because we were already here.
However, the financial and personal costs that we endured were a sacrifice for us all. There wasn’t any way around them, yet many other immigrants who feel more American than their own native nationality will never have the chance to be American as a result of these fees. Applications for work visas are $190. Applications for green cards are between $1,200 and $1,750, not including the mandatory medical examination needed for the application. Applications for Naturalization are $725.
For a majority of Harvard students, these costs are inconsequential. But compared to the median immigrant household income, these fees are steep costs that may require months or years of savings, especially for those with dependents.
It does not become a matter of who wants to become American, but a matter of who can afford to become American.
The ability to afford citizenship, whether it be in the form of time or money, is what a majority of the US population — including Harvard students — are ignorant of.
To begin: Having permission to work in the United States as a foreign national — in other words, obtaining the work visa — is tied to your employer. This means if your job is high paying and you have no need to transfer jobs, then you can endure the long, financially intensive process of working towards citizenship.
However, for many immigrants, having permission to work tied to your employer means no ability to transfer jobs with better opportunities and being forced to stay at your current job. With many immigrants already having low-paying jobs, the costs of citizenship begin to accumulate, meaning fewer low-income immigrants who want to be citizens can afford it.
As of 2021, 26 percent of the US population are immigrants, with the number growing every year. It is imperative for future American leaders and the population to comprehend that we do not become citizens overnight. We don’t become green card holders by chance. Visas are not handed out for free.
Ask Naturalized citizens if the arduous process was worth it, and they’ll say yes. Despite the struggles, being a US citizen is a proud achievement. It welcomes me to the greatest country in the world. It welcomes me to the freedom to openly criticize the US — a freedom that is not promised everywhere. And it completes my American dream: one where a Mexican child who always heard of the wonders of America will be able to fully relish and participate in it.
I believe every immigrant wanting to become an American citizen should be able to do so free of costs and personal burdens, and I believe that as Americans, we should change our immigration practices to facilitate the process.
Being American is one of my proudest accomplishments, and those who share the same passion and vigor to become part of the citizenry should only be limited by their love for their new nation — not by the depths of their pockets.

Quincy House sophomore Luke T. Balstad ’25 died unexpectedly at his home in Michigan, the College announced Tuesday.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana described Balstad as “bright and kind” and “passionate about science and the outdoors” in an email to Harvard undergraduates on Tuesday.
“So many people loved him,” Khurana wrote.
The school did not disclose a cause of death.
In an email to Quincy residents, Faculty Deans Eric Beerbohm and Leslie J. Duhaylongsod and Resident Dean Nicole S. Simon called Balstad a “beloved” student who “brought a warmth and incredible kindness to house life.”
“We are heartbroken,” the house deans wrote. “Luke had a tight-knit friend group at Harvard and we were proud to call him a member of our Quincy House community. His passing is a loss for all of us. In difficult times, a community comes together to grieve and to share strength.”
“As Luke’s mom, Kim, said: ‘It was not his brilliance that set him apart; it was his kindness,’” they wrote.
During his time at the College, Balstad volunteered for the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, researched at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and was a member of the Harvard Outing Club, according to the house deans’ announcement. Before Balstad’s freshman year, he participated in the First-Year Outdoor Program.
In his freshman year, Balstad resided in Maple Yard. He graduated from Hudsonville High School in Hudsonville, Michigan, where he was a leader of the marching band and ran for the cross country team, the house deans said.
In his email, Khurana encouraged Harvard affiliates to check in with friends and family members in wake of the news.
“That this news is coming at a time when we have just learned of recent tragedies on campuses across the country means that you may find yourself struggling to absorb so much news of loss,” Khurana wrote. “I hope you will remember that there is no right way to mourn or feel when learning about someone’s passing.”
There will be a gathering for students to mourn Balstad at 8 p.m. Tuesday in Quincy House’s Junior Common Room, the deans announced.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center hosted a virtual panel Tuesday on efforts to reduce violence against health care workers.
Panelists at the event, entitled “Violence in Healthcare: A Growing Crisis,” included U.S. House Representative Madeleine C. Dean (D-Pa.), registered nurse Elise Wilson, and president-elect of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety Connie Packard. Petrie-Flom Center Visiting Fellow Stephen P. Wood moderated the event.
During the panel, Wood shared statistics about rising cases of violence against health care workers.
“We know that violence is four times more prevalent in the health care setting than any other industry aside from law enforcement,” Wood said. “We know that 20 to maybe 30 percent of health care providers report having been either witness to or involved in some type of violent event.”
Wilson said she faced violence while working as a nurse in a community emergency room. A former patient of the hospital returned weeks after his initial visit and attacked Wilson, causing permanent nerve damage that led to the loss of control of her hand.
“I can’t work anymore because I can’t even put a pair of gloves on. It’s very difficult,” Wilson said. “To say it’s changed my life would be an understatement.”
Despite the prevalence of violence against health care workers, Wilson said that little has been done to mitigate harm, citing the fact that, in Massachusetts, it is not a felony to assault health care workers.
“I know there are bills out there, but nothing’s been done to breeze them through,” Wilson said.
Dean said she aims to enact legislation which would defend health care workers across the country against violence. In June, Dean and U.S. Representative Larry D. Bucshon (R-Ind.) proposed the Safety From Violence for Healthcare Employees Act which would criminalize the assault or intimidation of hospital employees.
In addition, if passed, the act would provide $25 million for education and prevention measures, Dean said.
“We hope that by doing this — by passing this bill, making it a federal crime — that’ll be a real deterrent to folks who are in these settings to say ‘Hold up, no way is violence acceptable in these settings,’” Dean said.
Wilson also said she believes there is a lack of support for health care workers who are targets of violence.
“Nowhere else in a profession would — if you were a target of some sort of assault, verbal or physical — somebody say to you, ‘Well, what could you have done differently to prevent this?’” she said.
Wilson said hospitals should support assaulted health care workers by instead asking questions like, “What can we do to help you?” and “What can we do to prevent this from ever happening again?”
Packard said IAHSS aims to minimize health care violence, including providing resources for policy guidelines and heightened security measures at hospitals.
“We help and heal at health care facilities,” Packard said. “There’s no way you can do that if all you’re worried about is being assaulted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously adopted a resolution last week urging Harvard to raise the salaries of its clerical and technical workers to keep up with the pace of inflation and rising costs of living.
The resolution, sponsored by Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and multiple city councilors, urged the University “to meet the salary demands being made by the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers in their ongoing contract negotiations.”
The resolution was sent to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Harvard Director of Government and Community Relations Thomas J. Lucey, and HUCTW President Carrie E. Barbash on Nov. 9.
HUCTW has been in negotiations with Harvard since its contract expired on Sept. 30, but conversations have stalled in recent weeks. The previous agreement has been extended indefinitely until a new contract can be ratified.
“We were really thrilled to get the proclamation from the city council,” Barbash said. “Part of what we’re trying to do in terms of moving forward with contract negotiations is broaden the conversation to other folks in the community and not just the Harvard community.”
Barbash said she thinks the City Council’s resolution will help push Harvard toward a compromise.
“I think it’s the combination of getting many voices involved in discussion and putting constructive pressure on key leaders from many different angles,” she said. “I think this is a really important one because Harvard is such a huge part of the Cambridge community.”
“I don’t see how you could continue to say we can’t give you raises that don’t keep up with inflation,” Barbash added. “It just seems unreasonable and cruel, frankly.”
HUCTW has not yet publicized the council’s resolution among its members, but Barbash thinks union members will find it “meaningful” to have received the city government’s backing.
Cambridge City Councilor Marc C. McGovern said it “shouldn’t be really surprising to folks that we would pass a resolution supporting workers in their demands for better benefits and fair wages.”
“We’ve done this before and, unfortunately, I’m sure we’re going to have to do it again, because these are going to be constant battles,” he said.
McGovern said he hopes that one day, Harvard will “do better by their workforce” without external pressure.
“As much as I enjoy a good rally, it shouldn’t always be such an uphill battle,” he said. “Nobody who works for the most prestigious university in the world should have to work two jobs to pay their rent — nothing prestigious about that.”
“Hopefully, our resolution and our speaking out in some small way moves things forward,” he added.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the resolution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the 2022 midterm elections, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and former West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant discussed election security, former U.S. President Donald J. Trump, and the politicization of their office at an Institute of Politics forum held Tuesday evening.
Abby Phillip ’10, a senior political correspondent and weekend news anchor for CNN, moderated the panel. Tennant is a voting rights advocate and an IOP fellow, and Raffensperger gained national attention in 2020 when he resisted pressure from Trump to overturn the presidential election results in Georgia. Trump told the Republican Secretary of State he wanted to “find 11,780 votes.”
Raffensperger said he now believes Trump knew he had lost the election in Georgia.
Hours before Trump announced his third bid for the presidency, Raffensperger did not endorse any prominent 2024 Republican hopefuls — including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence — but said he is looking for a presidential candidate “that has character, integrity, honesty, ability to engage in civil discourse, that speaks kindly.”
During an audience Q & A session, Raffensperger also declined to call Trump a “fascist,” saying he tries to “stay away from labeling and using pejoratives.”
“What I will say is that encouraging violence is always wrong,” he said.
During the event, Tennant emphasized the importance of candidates conceding gracefully and setting an example, pointing to Democratic U.S. Representative Tim Ryan’s concession speech in the 2022 U.S. Senate election for Ohio.
“He said that in a positive way,” Tennant said. “This is the way that you concede elections.”
“We just have to keep showing that example,” she added.
Raffensberger said he hopes Republicans deliver conservative policy and ask what young constituents want to see from the party.
“I want your generation back because I believe in conservatism,” he said. “I believe in fiscal sanity.”
Phillip also asked the panelists about Republican pushes to discourage vote by mail and absentee voting during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as voter suppression more broadly. Raffensperger said he “got a lot of blowback” for sending out absentee ballot applications to every active registered voter in 2020.
“Our business is to encourage the voters to vote and to vote for you,” Raffensperger said. “I’ve never been afraid of voters.”
During the panel, Phillip contrasted Raffensberger’s and Tennant’s experiences as secretaries of state. Tennant, Phillip said, “became a secretary of state back when it was boring.”
“People just generally thought it’s Election Day, it’s time to have an election,” Tennant said. “That’s not the case as we know.”
Across the country, secretaries of state have faced new challenges in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. After refusing to bend to Trump’s request to “find” Georgia votes, Raffensberger and his family were threatened by far-right extremists, which he said was “very distressing.”
While Tennant said people are relieved prominent election deniers — such as Nevada secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant and Arizona governor candidate Kari Lake — were just defeated at the ballot box, she warned against complacency.
“We can’t breathe a sigh of relief like, ‘Oh man, we got this. We turned them back. We’re good,’” Tennant said. “No, it always has to be this vigilant.”
With the 2024 presidential election on the horizon, Phillip said America should “make secretaries of state boring again.”
“That’s our goal,” Raffensperger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s five undergraduate peer counseling groups have seen a steady influx of student visitors this semester after resuming full in-person operation.
The College’s peer counseling groups include Contact, ECHO, Indigo, Response, and Room 13, each of which have a different area of specialization. More than 130 students sought support from the groups between September and October — in-person or via phone call — per a Harvard University Health Services spokesperson.
This semester marks the first time since before the pandemic that all five peer counseling groups are “back up and running,” Counseling and Mental Health Services Chief Barbara Lewis said in an October interview with The Crimson.
“In August of this year, we had our first full training of all the peer counseling groups,” Lewis said. “Every peer counseling group is supervised by a CAMHS clinician, and they work under that clinician’s license.”
In October, Harvard rolled out a new mental health initiative and announced new wellness service offerings. The University also highlighted the peer counseling groups as another available resource.
With their revival, some of the groups, including Room 13, have seen comparable attendance rates to pre-pandemic levels.
“Pre-pandemic, Room 13 was getting really busy," Lewis said. "I think they saw up to 200 students over the course of a year, which is a lot."
In comparison, Room 13 has supported more than 70 students so far this semester.
In addition to the five peer counseling groups that existed before the pandemic, two Harvard undergraduates launched a new group last spring called Harvard Undergraduate Peer Therapy. HUGPT practices interpersonal psychotherapy, or IPT, and students can get certified to become “facilitators” through the IPT Institute.
Eric H. Li ’23-’24, one of the founders of HUGPT, wrote in an emailed statement that the group is currently serving around 15 students through five facilitators.
“Typically, a group session starts with a check-in on how people are doing and then shifting into a more structured conversation about that week’s topic (ex: isolation or interpersonal dispute),” Li wrote. “Over the next 1.5 hours, people share their experiences, relate to others, provide/receive support from their peers, and discuss things they could try.”
One of the older peer counseling groups, Contact Peer Counseling, provides support for students with experiences surrounding mental health and LGBTQ+ issues. The group provides confidential, non-directive, and non-judgmental peer counseling, rather than psychotherapy, per Contact Co-Director Sofia S. Flynn ’25.
“We provide a space for people to talk about their experiences, thoughts, and emotions, but we are not trained therapists or clinicians, and therefore, we are not in the position of being able to give directive advice and tell people what they should or should not do,” Flynn said.
Heer Patel ’23, Contact co-director, said the group focuses on non-directive counseling to respond to the unique needs of LGBTQ+ students.
“Contact might be a little bit stricter about this than other peer counseling groups, but one of the reasons why we try to stick to being so non-directive and non-judgmental is because a lot of the drop-ins that come in are part of the LGBTQIA+ community and may have been told all their life how they should feel or what they should do,” Patel said. “We try to stay away from contributing to that.”
There are currently 15 students on the Contact team, per Flynn.
According to Flynn, Contact looks for peer counselors who are active listeners and practice compassion. All Contact peer counselors undergo a two-stage interview process and extensive training at the beginning of the semester.
Patel said working in peer counseling has been a rewarding experience.
“The act of being able to be a witness to someone's experience and make sure they don't have to do it alone — at least for me, coming out of the pandemic in a college that can sometimes feel really lonely — is incredibly important, and I'm really glad to be able to do it,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics announced its new student leaders Monday following a 10-day campaign period and an organization-wide election.
The incoming executive team includes President Amen H. Gashaw ’24, Vice President Pratyush Mallick ’25, Treasurer Carter G. Demaray ’25, and Communications Director Ethan C. Kelly ’25. The election, which ran from Friday morning to Sunday night, allowed any member of an IOP program who attended at least 50 percent of their program's meetings to vote.
Gashaw and Mallick, who ran on one ticket, campaigned through a series of emails and office hours. The pair’s first task after the transition period will be to develop and pilot a new online system called the IOP Portal, which will allow members to keep track of their event attendance and submitted applications, Gashaw said in an interview with The Crimson.
“We want to make sure that no one kind of gets lost in the shuffle or feels like they’ve been left behind,” Gashaw said.
Gashaw, who is finishing her role as communications director, joined the IOP just before her first year at the College as a freshman representative. Prior to running for president, she also served on the Harvard Political Review and the Harvard Votes Challenge, where she met Mallick.
Mallick recalled sitting in Eliot Grille with Gashaw while they video-called family and friends, awaiting a phone call from the current IOP executives that would inform them of the election results. After receiving the congratulatory phone call, they celebrated.
“The old exec of the IOP was incredible,” Mallick said. “It’s an opportunity, continue their work and expand upon it — to really bring back to the things that we’ve had in the past, like full-ride scholarship programs, opportunity for members to engage in the community.”
Mallick said he looks forward to bringing back successful IOP events hosted in the past, like Gov 2.0, a civic innovation competition using technology to address political issues.
“I’m really passionate about technology, and how we can use tech to pursue this passion of social good and really mobilizing voters, making sure that they have the resources they need to get out their ballots,” he said.
Treasurer-elect Demaray said he hopes to make the position accessible to IOP members by holding “treasurer talks” — office hours where students can ask for help with the process of receiving financial aid and stipends.
“It’s especially important to me as a first-generation, low-income student, that we’re getting these resources out to the students interested in public service,” he said.
Demaray joined the IOP as a freshman representative last year and currently serves as the chair of the Harvard Political Union.
Kelly, who has served as co-communications director for the Fellows and Study Group Program and the communications director for the Harvard Political Union, said he “felt really inspired” and “excited” for the role of IOP communications director.
Kelly said he hopes to continue the “very strong” communications output to make things “more accessible” by “reaching students where they are” while using social media to feature the IOP’s smaller programs.
“Small programs definitely deserve to be highlighted just as much as bigger programs,” he said.
The incoming IOP leaders will step into their positions on Dec. 1.
Correction: November 16, 2022:
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Amen H. Gashaw previously led the Harvard Political Review and the Harvard Votes Challenge. In fact, she was a member of the programs, but not their leader.

Harvard Law School graduates discussed working in death penalty defense at a virtual event hosted by the HLS library on Tuesday evening.
The panel discussion, entitled “Death Penalty Defense Work: Prof. Carol Steiker in conversation with HLS alumni,” was part of the library’s yearlong series of programs related to its art and history exhibit, “Visualizing Capital Punishment: Spectacle, Shame, and Sympathy.”
Moderated by HLS professor Carol S. Steiker ’82, the event featured HLS graduates from 2010 to 2021 discussing what it takes to become a public defender of those facing death sentences.
Nora A. McDonnell, a judicial law clerk in a New Mexico U.S. District Court, described hardships she initially faced as a capital defense lawyer.
“In my one year I lost everything, like my first client was executed,” McDonnell said. “Nothing legally worked. And it was totally wrenching.”
McDonnell also raised the question of the extent to which the law should grant religious liberties to people who are under warrant.
“I’m interested to see if there’s more there, or if we’re sort of at capacity in what they’re willing to allow, in terms of accommodating religious preferences and rights at an execution,” McDonnell said.
Megan E. Barnes, assistant federal public defender at the Federal Public Defender’s Office for the District of Arizona, talked about the importance of “being able to show up for your clients” and their families.
The panel also featured two members of The Powell Project, a team of lawyers that works to combat the death penalty: William E. Ahee, staff attorney at The Powell Project, and Julianne R. Hill, assistant director of The Powell Project.
During the event, Hill discussed changes in capital law.
“There is always so much to just push back on, and particularly at the trial level,” Hill said. “You can just pick anything that seems unfair and write a motion about it.”
Julia Welsh, a research and writing attorney at the Federal Community Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, talked about her experience pushing back against forms of capital punishment in Tennessee.
As a member of a specialized team on lethal injections, she said she helped demonstrate the state's lethal injection process was so “unbelievably uncoordinated” that the governor halted lethal injection executions until an internal review could take place.
Michael B. Admirand, senior attorney at the Southern Center for Human Rights, talked about what he learned from his setbacks and gave advice for students who want to explore a career in capital defense.
“What I’ve always said, and what one of my mentors said, is you have to define victory very broadly,” Admirand said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of a neo-Nazi group harassed and threatened residents in Cambridge Sunday, lunging and shouting at people across the street from Quincy House.
Members of the group wore apparel bearing the name of the Nationalist Social Club, also known as the 131 Crew, a neo-Nazi group based in New England. The group is known for espousing antisemitic and white supremacist rhetoric and violence, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
A video posted by NSC-131 Tuesday on the online video-sharing platform Odysee showed members of the group performing an apparent Nazi salute in front of the Democracy Center — a Cambridge meeting house where the Boston Anarchist Bookfair was taking place over the weekend. Members of the group pounded on the doors and windows of the building and lunged at passersby on the street.
“NSC 131 lads confronted Antifa at the Boston Anarchist Bookfair in Cambridge, Massachusetts,” the group wrote in the video’s description. “Antifa hid inside and hostile passerby were quickly deterred. Whose Streets? Our streets!”
Another video circulated on Twitter showed at least a dozen people wearing NSC-131 apparel chanting outside the Democracy Center, with some lunging at passersby and shouting threats and slurs.
“You want to punch a Nazi?” one of the masked men asked. “Come on, motherfucker!”
This is the first reported instance of NSC-131 activity in Cambridge.
The Democracy Center had been hosting the Boston Anarchist Bookfair, an annual event that showcases anarchist, anti-capitalist, and anti-fascist literature each November.
In a statement posted on Twitter Monday, the bookfair wrote that volunteers and attendees at the event prevented the NSC-131 members from entering the Democracy Center and no one was physically injured.
Chris Hood founded NSC-131 in 2019. Hood was arrested for fighting in public in July when he and other members of the group protested at a children’s drag queen story hour.
In an emailed statement, Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote that the department responded to reports of NSC-13 intimidating citizens Sunday. The department did not locate the van in which the group departed.
“Under the First Amendment, there is no law abridging freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble or to petition the government for a redress of grievances,” Warnick wrote. “What the First Amendment does not allow, however, is bias motivation, threatening behavior, or interference with civil rights as reflected in the video.”
According to BridgeStat, CPD’s annual crime report, Cambridge saw 35 hate crimes in 2021, a decade high. Twenty-five of the incidents were categorized as racial or ethnic bias-based.
Government and law enforcement officials in Massachusetts have increased efforts to confront hate crime in recent months, including the rollout of a dedicated hate crime hotline by U.S. Attorney Rachael S. Rollins in August.
The bookfair thanked the volunteers who kept the NSC-131 members from entering the building.
“Whether you’re bringing extra snacks, wearing a mask, or shutting a door in a fascist’s face — you’re participating in important acts of community care and solidarity,” the bookfair tweeted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team closed their fall season on Saturday, October 29th with a strong showing at the Grandover Intercollegiate Invitational, finishing fourth at the event hosted by UNC Greensboro.
The Crimson scored a team total of three over par in the 54-hole tournament, shooting rounds of 292-291-284. UNC Greensboro won the tournament, shooting a whopping 38 under par on its home turf.
“It was a good result against some pretty good teams in the South,” Coach Kevin Rhoades said.“We can handle it pretty well and our last round was solid, shooting four-under as a team. We were good, but we couldn't get way under par and it turned out that that was a tournament that you had to be way under par to win”.
This was the first time Harvard played in the tournament, or in any tournament this late in the fall in recent years, as past fall seasons have not typically stretched so deep into October.
“It was kind of uncharted territory for the team, but I think we handled it well,” sophomore Brian Ma said.
The Crimson sat at seventh through the first two rounds, but strung together a strong third round to bounce back into the top five.
“We started off the tournament a little bit slow,” said senior captain Brian Isztwan. “Then everybody got it back together in the first round. The second round, we did alright then too but then the third round we really put on a charge.”
Ma led the way for the Crimson, continuing a season-long tear of under-par performances with a one-under par score. Matching Ma at one-under par was sophomore Diego Saavedra-Davila. Both players finished tied for 15th overall in the field. Isztwan and sophomore Jeff Fang stayed close behind the top pair, placing 30th at one over par. Junior Adam Xiao filled out the Harvard score sheet shooting seven over par and tied for 48th. Freshman Darren Choi finished at ten over.
This tournament ended one of Harvard’s strongest fall seasons in program history, where the Crimson rewrote almost every record in the Harvard history book. The Crimson set new one, two, and three-round records during the Doc Glimmer Tournament, hosted by St. John’s University, to open the season on September 10.
The team also recorded their lowest ever team stroke-per-round average, clocking in at 281.43, eight strokes better than the 2021 season average, where they also eclipsed the previous record.
“I'm proud of them again,” Rhodes said. “On a competitive level they are performing on a very high level. We’ve had some super strong teams and won some Ivy League championships in the past and this team is performing on that level or even a little bit better right now, but I also really like what the team chemistry has going, and kind of how the guys are coming together and working in the right direction on all the given things.”
The Crimson garnered top-five finishes in its three tournaments preceding Grandover. After the Doc Glimmer, the team finished second at the MacDonald Cup in New Haven, CT hosted by Yale on September 24. Harvard then traveled to the University of California Berkeley on October 10 for the Alister Mackenzie Invitational, placing fifth as a team.
Harvard enjoyed a number of memorable individual performances this season as well. Ma set fall season program records for lowest 54-hole scoring average at 69.33, never shooting above par in a single round.
Isztwan followed right on Ma’s tail all season with a 70.33 scoring average in his final fall season wearing the Crimson uniform. The pair embodied consistency all fall.
As a whole, the Crimson recorded a team average of 2.5 strokes under par in the four tournaments they played.
“One of our goals for the season was to start off strong,”Ma said. “That was just kind of our motto: start strong and stay strong.”
Perhaps the most electrifying highlight of the fall came from Fang. The sophomore set program records for both two and three-round scores at the St. John’s invitational, shooting ten-under through 36 holes and nine-under through 54.
The rest of the team also contributed in posting low scoring rounds across the season. Every member of the team scored below at least 68 strokes, or three under par, in at least one round this season.
A common denominator for these results is the adoption of a stat-tracking system called Decade, which the team has used in practice and tournaments throughout this season.
“Basically it keeps track of your stats in different categories of your game,” said Ma. “It really made us more efficient just in terms of how we needed to practice. It told us areas of improvement and told us what we were doing well. It was a confidence booster and taught us how to be more efficient in practice.”
Efficiency is key for a team like the Crimson, who practice in a Northeast climate that proves especially difficult throughout the winter, placing it at a disadvantage compared to teams that have easier access to practice all year round. However, the improved performance of this fall signals optimism that the new practice strategies will continue to produce strong results in the spring.
“The fall always informs the spring because we learn in our individual games which parts are the weakest that we need to work on,” Isztwan said. “Last year we felt like we had all the talent in the world, like we were the best team to tee the green at ivy Leagues. We just felt like the putting was coming up short. We made that a goal this year to become the best putting team in the Ivy League and it's shown already.”
As this season closes, all eyes turn towards championship season in the spring and a return to glory atop the Ivy League.
“If we can keep the putting together,” Isztwan said, “I think we have a great shot at winning the Ivy League and making a splash at regionals.”
The Crimson will likely announce the spring schedule in February and compete in their first tournament in March.

Let’s face it, it’s hard to find gratitude when you’re swamped with p-sets and papers while the ever-present cold? flu? unknown-disease-that-leaves-a-monster-cough makes its annual circulation across campus. However, with Thanksgiving right around the corner, I thought it would be an appropriate time to take a step back and try being thankful for the little things in life.
Biking Along the Charles
I have no idea why I never tried this before, but during the short period of time when 45-minute Bluebike rides were free due to the Orange Line shutdown, I biked along the Charles for the first time and it was LIFE-CHANGING. The wind in my hair, the beautiful scenery, the endorphin rush from pedaling. It was absolutely perfect and a must-try experience. Maybe there will be a few more global-warming-days for you to try before the semester ends.
The Yard Foliage
New England’s finest and prettiest season has made a return. Is it concerning that the Yard trees are still a little green? Yes. Is it a problem that it has been 75 degrees in the middle of November? Also yes. However, I will take whatever color I can get before we face five months of winter where the Yard turns into a bare pit of mud and naked trees.
Taylor Swift
Ms. Taylor Alison Swift is truly a mastermind. Midnights has single-handedly pulled me through midterm season. I may pull up to class with bedhead and sweatpants but I can still make the whole place shimmerrrr. You know I’ll be bejeweled at her upcoming tour concert (if I can even get my hands on tickets — I know all of you waiting in the ticket queue are the reason the wifi is acting up).
Sunday’s Sundaes Sundaze
If there is anything that brings me joy, it’s alliteration. Sure, the ice cream with chocolate syrup, crushed Oreos, and sprinkles are great, but the fact that this weekly treat is referred to as “Sunday’s Sundaes Sundaze” is simply the cherry on top. Whoever came up with the name deserves a gold sticker and all the ice cream sundaes in the world.
House/HUDS Staff
BIG thank you to the House and HUDS Staff who feed us and keep our communal spaces clean and running. I admit, I do actively complain about the menu constantly. However, I can’t stress enough how extremely thankful I am that I’m not responsible for making my own meals. I can’t even say I have the right to critique the food quality because I can barely make toast. Point is, I really do appreciate all the work and effort the staff put into maintaining our community.
You
No, not the TV show. I’m talking about you ;) I’m thankful for everyone who read this article. I appreciate you. Please take care of yourself and find time to enjoy life. It’s hard out here, but remember, some people go to Y*le.
It’s been a fun reflection to name a few of the things I’m grateful for. Am I going to go back to complaining about every little inconvenience that comes my way as soon as I finish writing this? ABSOLUTELY. But at least I tried, in the spirit of this season of giving thanks. <3
