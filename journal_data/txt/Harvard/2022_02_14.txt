The Valentine’s Day spirit is in the air, and that means a chance to celebrate all things love! Whether you plan to celebrate with your significant other, best friends, or Datamatch date, treat them to one of the best date spots in Harvard Square. Instead of 4:00 a.m. El Jefe’s meals and date nights in your twin XL bed, check out the list below for some extra special Valentine’s Day spots in or around Harvard Square!
1. Best Budget-Friendly Date: Takeout on the Widener Steps
To the untrained eye, the Widener steps may not seem like a prime date stop. However, Harvardians know that grabbing a meal and people watching on the steps is the perfect combination — basically dinner and a show! Plus, the chilly winter air is the perfect excuse to cuddle up to your date.
2. Best Dinner Date: Alden and Harlow
Alden and Harlow is indulgent, romantic, and serves delectable New American cuisine. Get to know your date over amazing grilled rosemary focaccia and addictive fried brussel sprouts! The classic Harvard Square establishment is also attached to the Longfellow Bar, a one-stop shop for drinks and a bite.
Pro-tip: The Longfellow Bar has great cocktails and mocktails for a late night drink.
3. Best Late-Night Date: The Weld Solarium and the Harvard College Observatory
What’s more romantic than an evening under the stars? Bring your date to the Weld Solarium (or the Harvard College Observatory, with access passes) and spend the night in deep conversation while gazing at the cosmos. The Observatory is also home to a collection of some 500,000 historical astronomical plates that delve into the history of HCO!
4. Best Coffee Date: L.A. Burdick
It may be the most expensive cup of coffee you’ll ever purchase in Harvard Square, but L.A. Burdick makes the most undeniably creamy, decadent hot drinks inside a beautiful gourmet coffee shop. Indulge in a delicious mocha, or pick up some spicy drinking chocolate for an at-home treat. For those who prefer non-caffeinated beverages, L.A. Burdick’s famous hot chocolate is a must-try.
5. Best Study Date: The Cabot Library Couches
Did your date night get ruined by a surprise PSET? Is your essay overdue? No need to worry — study dates are here to save the day! Invite your classroom crush to the Cabot Library couches to study, and get to know each other over Clover coffees.
6. Best Galentine’s Date: Henrietta’s Table
Valentine’s Day is the perfect opportunity to celebrate the love between friends and family. Show your appreciation for loved ones by treating them to brunch at Henrietta’s Table. Their menu highlights delicious farm-to-table meals, which rotate daily based on the availability of local farmers and artisans. Make sure to check out Henrietta’s pie of the day for a locally-inspired sweet treat!

Well, damn. Look at us now.
“Strangers with memories” or whatever dramatic quote we’ll retweet on Twitter.
I’ve had quite the lifetime of experiences with breakups: a total of four over six years. Still wondering if I’ll end up with an average of one breakup a year. Each of them was a different type of hurt, a different type of person, and a different version of love — if you could call it that.
For those lucky enough to have never experienced a breakup, they suck. They’re horrendous. You hear those classic last words or see those three little text bubbles, your aching heart sinks to the bottom of your toes, and before you know it, your life is fundamentally derailed from the course it was on previously.
I hate heartbreaks, but I don’t hate love. I haven’t yet become that Neuroscience concentrator who believes that love is only neurons firing in association with a person or feeling. I haven’t yet become a cynic who argues there’s no point to falling in love when it could all end in a matter of seconds, words, or texts.
Every time I’ve had to hear those relationship-ending words, I’ve had to ask myself: was it worth it? Was the breakup worth all the memories the two of you made together? Was it worth sharing each and every one of your dreams and goals with each other? Was all of it together, the euphoric relationship and the devastating breakup, the rise and the fall, the highs and the lows, worth it?
It was worth it.
Despite all the tears I shed, I wouldn’t have had this little ol’ heart of mine crushed any other way. My breakups made me into the person I am today.
My heartbreaks taught me how to handle the loss of a best friend. They taught me how to differentiate between being appreciated and being spared the bare minimum. They taught me that individual lives sometimes just don’t line up, no matter how hard you try to fit the puzzle pieces together.
Sometimes, I wish I could have just read the paragraph above and taken my word for it. I wish I could have known these lessons in advance — but I’m glad I learned it through you, all the girls I’ve loved before. I’m glad I had the chance to watch you sing at your recital. I’m glad we watched those hot air balloons in the sky. I’m glad I asked you out with no time left. I’m glad I cooked that fancy dinner with the cheesy music on just for you.
This Valentine’s Day, for the first time in a very long time, I won’t have a card, chocolates, or even roses to buy for that someone special in my life. And I’m okay with it. I’ll have the lessons you taught me to carry with me to make the day special.
So to all the girls who broke my heart:
I hope that you find someone closer to home who can see you any day of the week and give you a rose on each one of those days.
I hope that you find what truly makes you happy.
I hope that you find that adventure in Italy, Greece, France, or Mars.
I hope that you find someone that completes your puzzle, even if that somebody isn’t me.
But most importantly, I hope that you all have a wonderful Valentine’s Day without me.
And to all the future girls that may or may not break my heart: let me down easy. It’s Valentine’s Day, after all.
Your ex- (or future) Valentine,
Markus Anzaldua-Campos

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A buzzing atmosphere, unexpected conversations, and time to slow down the pace of our busy lives. All of this we had, and all of this we lost for a time. The brief return of grab-and-go dining this semester reminds us how central the dining halls are to Harvard’s culture and community and how much we owe to the people who keep them running.
Returning to our dining halls in the fall semester was exhilarating. The paradoxically intimate coffeehouse culture of these cavernous halls was again ours to enjoy. We lost hours of valuable grind time to unexpected chats with people we hadn’t spoken to in months, allowing ourselves to prize contact over productivity. Like most community-building indulgements, it proved worthwhile; the most spontaneous run-ins often led to the most enlightening and humanizing conversation. We were back, and grateful for it.
Then, in January, Omicron came and dining halls went. It was back to grab-and-go through the first few weeks of the spring, all packaged meals and missed converstations. The transition wasn’t seamless, either. Quad students in particular struggled to find a place to eat because of poor communication and the impractical distance between their dorms and their classes. Students at Currier House and Pforzheimer House, for instance, grabbed but had nowhere to go, after their houses failed to suggest any practical indoor dining. Meanwhile, trash cans across campus overflowed with the sudden influx of grab-and-go waste, raising sustainability and general hygiene concerns.
The rollout, in short, was bumpy. And yet, the most notable mark of the grab-and-go period was interpersonal, not practical. Amidst packed bins and locked dinning halls, we missed the intangible.
Freshmen lost Annenberg, unrivaled across the whole University in its social scale and essential  to making a sprawling 1,900 person class feel a tiny bit smaller. Sophomores woke up to the worst possible sort of déjà vu, reminded of their unique on-campus life last year, once again bringing back food to be reheated and deleted in the solitude of their rooms. Even juniors and seniors, with their tighter preexisting bonds, missed the thrill of running into an unexpected face in the dinning hall, or of desperately attempting to avoid doing so. On the heels of a closer-to-normal semester, the sudden return to restrictions felt jarring, a regression towards the non-normalcy we were so eager to leave behind.
That stage is behind us now — for the time being, at least. In-person dining is back, and we couldn’t feel more grateful. Losing it twice should, if anything, remind us of the central role it plays in our lives, of how meaningful every forced smile by the grill and awkward across-the-hall wave is in tying our community together. Not having access to these basic rituals, not being able to break bread with our peers, takes a substantial toll on our wellbeing. Anthropologists place social eating at the heart of community and make clear that it holds immense social value — eating brings us together on a biological level, and we should be grateful for the opportunity to do so together.
That gratitude need not be directed skyward. We can, instead, aim it at the HUDS workers who swipe us in every morning and every evening, who keep our dining halls running and embody the best of Harvard, who do their best to provide appetizing meals to hordes of underslept, overworked young adults. Their commitment to this community— working through a pandemic, a blizzard, a supply chain crisis — is one that deserves praise and gratitude, not only in the midst of crisis but long afterward.
Even for those of us who prefer the efficient convenience of grab-and-go dining, simply walking past a full dining hall, loudly and emphatically occupied, is a reminder of our collective humanity. A reminder that, eventually, we must eat, we must slow down, and we can come together when we do. That we don’t have to eat alone in our rooms while juggling an assignment and a Zoom meeting, and that we might not want to.
These are the important parts of life too often forgotten at Harvard. We hope that time will not dull our newfound appreciation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We the undersigned know John Comaroff to be an excellent colleague, advisor, and committed university citizen.”
It's rare for Harvard faculty members to assemble, like academic Avengers, to issue a proclamation. But last week, 38 chose to: releasing a letter declaring, in no uncertain terms, their support for their colleague.
The professors were “perplexed” by why sanctions resulted from the Title IX complaints of Lilia M. Kilburn — a Harvard graduate student who said in the Chronicle of Higher Education that Comaroff groped, kissed, and harassed her. They were “dismayed by Harvard’s sanctions,” which temporarily restricts Comaroff’s teaching and advising. And they took care to note that Comaroff has, “for five decades trained and advised hundreds of Ph.D. students of diverse backgrounds.”
Why couldn’t Kilburn shut up and be like them.
Less than 36 hours after graduate students filed a federal lawsuit claiming Harvard ignored sexual misconduct allegations against Comaroff for decades, 34 of the star-studded faculty who painted Comaroff as the victim frantically shifted into reverse, issuing a retraction. Our slow-moving university grew legs.
I read the lawsuit with a sick feeling in my stomach, wondering when exactly professors I’ve taken and admired chose to retract. Maybe when it describes how, at an annual brunch, Comaroff allegedly cornered Kilburn and forcefully kissed her on the mouth for the second time that year, grinning as she pushed him away. Or when Kilburn alleges, with witness testimony, Comaroff groped her at a department forum. Maybe when graduate students Margaret G. Czerwienski and Amulya Mandava alleged that, because they reported his groping, Comaroff warned they’d have “trouble getting jobs.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay curtly explained why faculty should have refrained from uplifting Comaroff. “If you have not reviewed the full findings of an investigation,” it is hard “to assess the proportionality of the response.” Still they quickly embraced Comaroff’s lawyers’ account.
I don’t buy that so many faculty acted out of mere ignorance, unable to fathom that the University possessed knowledge they did not.
The professors that signed the letter — which included 20 percent of Harvard’s University Professors, the highest title the University can bestow upon faculty — acted fratty.
In choosing to highlight how respected of a scholar Comaroff is, they conveniently forget that many infamous perpetrators of sexual misconduct — Weinstein, Cosby — were emboldened precisely because their cup overflowed with talent, granting them the power to silence their victims.
The power imbalance between Comaroff and his advisees is obvious to anyone who has relied upon a teacher's endorsement. In academia, professors hold the keys to the kingdom. Tenure immortalizes. A graduate student on the receiving end of a lukewarm recommendation letter might as well bid academia farewell.
When consequences finally found Comaroff, he called in the cavalry — towering figures like Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Jamaica Kincaid — convincing them that he, not the complainants, was the real victim. And they came. Power quickly chose power.
Katherine M. Enright ’22-’23 has taken two Anthropology courses in which Kilburn was a teaching fellow, including her ethnographic methods tutorial, a requirement for Social Anthropology concentrators.
“In many ways, she was part of the introduction to the Anthropology department,” Enright said of Kilburn. “She was just an incredible instructor.”
To realize Kilburn was “contributing so much to the Anthropology department” while “facing so much harassment within the department was something very painful.”
For Enright and many others, it's been a tough week. Reading the lawsuit and the allegations was “angering, saddening, enraging to the point of distress and distraction.” It became difficult for her to do schoolwork and engage in classes.
Professor Jean Comaroff, Comaroff’s wife, is portrayed as an enabler of his abuse in the suit. “I know people who are in her class and just find that a very difficult dynamic to deal with.”
Enright is still waiting on a real apology, which I agree a retraction isn’t.
Enright plans on attending a walkout Monday to show support for Comaroff’s accusers. William M. Sutton ’23, an organizer with Our Harvard Can Do Better, is helping coordinate it.
“There’s an opportunity to shake Harvard awake here.” His group, alongside HGSU's Feminist Working Group, is concerned by how professors “closing rank” against a Title IX reporter could discourage others from reporting, damaging an already broken reporting system.
Sutton is not alone. In her response to the faculty letter, Gay wrote that we, “perhaps especially the tenured faculty,” should ask what the letter signals, “particularly to those making that difficult choice of whether or not to come forward.”
One-third of undergraduate women surveyed at Harvard in 2019 said they had experienced some form of nonconsensual sexual contact. National numbers look similar. Very, very few report it.
Now, students have something new to fear when they consider approaching the Title IX Office: that professors they admire could lock arms, rush to aid their colleagues and, inextricably, undercut their claims. That scares me. I’m sure it scares others.
Seventy-three faculty signed a letter renouncing the first one. Thirty-five of the 38 original signers attempted, almost immediately, to put the words back in their mouths.
Still, for the rest of their education at Harvard, Kilburn, Czerwienski, and Mandava will live in a house of mirrors — surrounded, at every turn, by high-powered professors who rebuked them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirteen students hailing from nine upperclassmen houses were elected to Harvard's Undergraduate Council Friday in the body's midterm elections.
Tensions around the elections flared in Quincy House, where UC Finance Chair Daniella M. Berrospi ’24 survived a recall vote that came following accusations of financial mismanagement. An email petition circulated throughout the House garnered the support of ten percent of residents, initiating the recall vote.
Berrospi held onto her seat after fewer than the required two-thirds of voters cast ballots in favor of her removal. Roughly 47 percent of Quincy voters voted no confidence.
The night before voting closed, flyers calling for Berrospi’s removal were posted across the house. Many were later torn down and piled on the doorstep of UC President Michael Y. Cheng ’22, who also lives in Quincy. An email sent to Quincy students by the house's resident dean and faculty deans condemned the incident.
“It has come to our attention that some of our members may not be treating our community with the level of respect that we expect,” the email said.
Cheng responded to the email demanding an apology.
The exchange came just one week after another incident on the Quincy House email list in which residents sparred over the University’s Covid-19 response. Patrick I. Adolphus ’22 — an outspoken critic of Covid-19 restrictions whose email sparked the conflict — won a seat in the UC after garnering 55.2 percent of first choice votes.
Adolphus will serve as a Quincy House representative, alongside Berrospi.
He said he believes the support for his candidacy indicates a dissatisfaction among students with the school’s current Covid-19 policies
“I definitely think that it was a referendum on the policies regarding restricting social behavior and stuff like that,” Adolphus said. “That was my only real message throughout the candidacy.”
In Winthrop House, UC Secretary General Nicholas J. Brennan ’23, who ran for president of the body in the fall, lost to Trey Sullivan ’24. In Leverett House, two representatives — Chris T. Cantwell '22 and Spencer W. Glassman '24 — were elected after an additional seat opened up due to the removal of a member who had an insufficient attendance record.
Another familiar name returned to the ballot in the latest round of elections. After losing in his bid for UC president last fall, Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23 recycled his previous platform in a successful campaign for Kirkland House representative.
During their bid for president and vice president, Zimmerman and his then-running mate Joy Y. Lin ’23 had called the Council “incompetent” and argued that the UC had violated its constitution and committed tax fraud by failing to properly register for tax-exempt status. Then-Council President Noah A. Harris ’22 and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22 denied the allegations.
“It's not about uncovering — like, I don't care who did it or why. I just care that it's fixed,” Zimmerman said.
Standing by his campaign messaging, he also took aim at new goals, such as healing interpersonal conflict amongst UC members.
“Clearly the plans I had to reform the institution aren't going to be put in as quickly as I'd like — or maybe at all,” Zimmerman said. “But I feel that there's still ways to accomplish a lot of the change that needs to happen.”
The newly elected Council members are as follows:
Adams House
Oluwatobi Ariyo
Nick Gu
Cabot House
Yeseo Brooke Livingston
Dunster House
Quan Narula
Eliot House
Bobby Current

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will be one of Harvard’s Commencement speakers in May, according to a report in a Kiwi news outlet.
Stuff, the largest news website in New Zealand, reported Sunday that Ardern will speak to Harvard graduates during a spring trip to the U.S., citing two anonymous sources with knowledge of the preparations.
Harvard has committed to hosting two in-person ceremonies — one for the Class of 2022 and one for the Classes of 2020 and 2021, which graduated online due to the pandemic. University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in December each ceremony will have its own speaker, but the University has not formally revealed the speakers’ identities.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to confirm whether Ardern will speak at Commencement.
“Harvard has not yet announced its Commencement speaker, and with that I am not in a position to confirm any details regarding this year’s plans,” he wrote in an emailed statement Sunday.
Earlier this month, Ardern announced she would travel to the United States to lead a trade delegation, but a spokesperson for the prime minister declined to comment on whether she will speak at Harvard’s Commencement.
“The Prime Minister has already announced she will lead a trade delegation to America this year to help accelerate New Zealand’s economic recovery from COVID-19,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement Sunday. “The specifics of the itinerary will be announced closer to the time.”
Ardern became leader of the New Zealand Labour Party in August 2017. Two months later, at age 37, she became the county’s youngest prime minister in more than a century.
If she takes up the podium in Tercentenary Theater in May, Ardern will be the first in-person Commencement speaker in two years. Another head of state, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, was the last in-person Commencement speaker in 2019.
Last year, Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Prairie View A&M University, spoke during the virtual ceremony. Simmons, who led Brown University from 2001 to 2012, was the first Black president of an Ivy League institution.

The Sound Museum, a music rehearsal space and recording studio in Brighton, will move to a new location after life science developer IQHQ offered to finance its relocation.
Following its purchase of the Sound Museum’s building last year, the developer promised to fund the business’s move to a new space — to the owners’ relief.
For nearly four decades, the owners of the Sound Museum, Katherine and William “Des” Desmond, have used their business to foster Boston’s music scene.
“We're both musicians ourselves, so we have always tried to support our community because we are a part of it. These are people throughout our life that we have worked with, gigged with, written with, practiced with,” Katherine Desmond said. “This is our life and our community.”
The longstanding business has operated in several locations throughout its history.
“I started out at the South End almost 40 years ago,” William Desmond said. “It was the Big Dig that took the building we were in.”
The Sound Museum’s subsequent relocations were largely following lease terminations. The business has operated at its current location — 155 North Beacon St. — for 32 years.
William Desmond said he was concerned when IQHQ purchased his building last spring.
“This was the largest facility that we had,” he said. “This was the one that was the most worrisome.”
William Desmond said he was concerned about a rise in real estate prices due to the Allston-Brighton area’s increased development.
“My wife and I have seen what goes on in other cities all over with the development — real estate going through the roof,” he said. “We have been concerned for a long time for our music community.”
William Desmond said he was “relieved” when IQHQ approached him last fall and offered to help the business and its musicians find a new home.
“In September, [IQHQ] came to me and said, ‘We know that you have a large community of musicians in this building. And we intend on relocating you somewhere in Boston before we tear the building down,’” William Desmond said.
Katherine Desmond called the Sound Museum’s relationship with IQHQ “a breath of fresh air,” adding that she hopes their story can inspire future developers in the area.
“I hope what they’re offering sets a precedent for other companies that want to come into the city,” Katherine Desmond said. “So that you don’t just displace something when you’re developing, you’re actually working with what has been there so that people aren’t affected negatively.”
William Desmond said though he does not want to leave his existing location, he is grateful for the opportunity to continue his business.
“Do I want to leave the area? No. But this was the best case scenario,” William Desmond said. “It's going to be a move — a big move. But at least it looks like we’re going to be getting a home.”

The Cambridge City Council kickstarted its search for the next city manager — Cambridge’s most influential government post — last month.
The current city manager, Louis A. DePasquale, who was appointed in September 2016, plans to retire in July. The City Council’s selection process for his successor is anticipated to end in May.
Cambridge operates using a council-manager form of government, which is referred to as “Plan E” in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’s General Laws. While the power to set city policy resides within the City Council, the city manager — a professional appointed by the Council — is tasked with implementing their vision and overseeing the city’s budget.
“I think a lot of people just assume that you will elect nine people, including their mayor, and those are the people that are making the decisions in the city,” said Alanna M. Mallon, vice mayor of Cambridge. “Trying to educate residents about the importance of the city manager role has been what we’re trying to do.”
Mallon, who also serves as the chair of the government operations committee, is overseeing the selection process.
Earlier this month, the City Council released an interactive portal through coUrbanize for Cambridge residents and stakeholders to share their preferences for an ideal city manager. The platform also allows stakeholders to post and respond to each other’s questions.
The city will also be hosting a town hall on Wednesday to hear directly from residents.
The process of gathering public input also includes 20 focus groups, including those for the residents with disabilities, unhoused residents, and small business owners.
“We’re hoping with all of those different ways where people can plug in,” Mallon said. “Whether they’re sitting on the T, heading to work, they can quickly let us know their feedback.”
Mallon said that she hopes this year’s selection process will be more “accessible” to Cambridge residents whose voices are less amplified in city government.
“We’re really looking for voices who don’t normally get brought to the table, are able to engage in ways where they haven’t been able to, because participation has always been a function of privilege,” Mallon said.
“We really wanted to make sure, as a city council, that we were democratizing the process and making sure that it was available and open and accessible for everyone,” she added.
The Council has dedicated the month of February to public input. The feedback received from each of these town halls, focus groups, and the online portal will be organized and refined by a third-party consulting group – Randi Frank Consulting, LLC – to create the city’s manager’s publicized job description.
Once the job description becomes public, the consulting group will compile a list of candidates and conduct preliminary interviews. A screening committee — composed of some city councilors, Cambridge residents, and stakeholders — will continue interviewing candidates and choose finalists.
Following a final round of town halls for residents to speak directly with the candidates, the Council will vote on which finalist will become the city manager.
Councilor Burhan Azeem said he hopes the city manager will focus on making Cambridge more affordable and welcoming for new residents.
“I’m very interested in a city manager who’s focused on managing growth, around like, how do we welcome more people in Cambridge? How do we make housing more affordable in Cambridge?” Azeem said. “How do you manage that change, rather than asking if there will be change.”
Mallon said her personal priorities for the next city manager include fighting inequality and advocating for vulnerable residents in Cambridge.
“I think Covid really taught us and showed us how the social safety net just doesn’t exist for many, many, many of our residents,” Mallon said. “We have an opportunity, right now, to really make policies and be reactive to what we saw over the past few years.”
“The City Council as a whole sees this as the most important thing that we will do this term,” Mallon added.

Boston Children’s Hospital CEO Kevin B. Churchwell discussed equity, diversity, and inclusion in pediatrics at a virtual Q&A hosted by the Harvard School of Public Health Friday.
Churchwell, also a fellow at Harvard Medical School, spoke with moderator Asaf Bitton, executive director of Ariadne Labs, a center for health system innovation based at Harvard and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
During the event, titled “Kids and Health Equity,” Churchwell described his role creating the Institute for Pediatric Health Equity and Inclusion, housed at the Boston Children’s Hospital. The initiative, launched in October 2021, advances “pediatric health equity locally, nationally, and around the world” through public policy, research, and its endeavors to promote inclusion and diversity among healthcare providers.
“If we intentionally work on equity, diversity, and inclusivity, then the rest of pediatrics will also recognize that and be part of that,” Churchwell said.
Bitton focused Churchwell’s attention on a local health inequity, noting that the life expectancy differential between a child born in Back Bay and a child born in Roxbury is almost 30 years.
Churchwell acknowledged that child health is a “broad issue,” encompassing everything from treating chronic diseases to closing life expectancy gaps like these.
“We can't solve the problem as a hospital, but we certainly can be a convener,” Churchwell said. “We certainly can be an institution that brings together all the interested parties.”
Towards the end of the Q&A, Bitton re-oriented the discussion towards the effect Covid-19 has had on pediatric care. Churchwell said that the pandemic has significantly exacerbated behavioral and mental health challenges for children.
“We were seeing a rise in the number of our children with these issues, presenting to our emergency departments and presenting to our primary care practices [before the pandemic],” Churchwell said. “But with Covid it has become overwhelming. It is not idiosyncratic to the state of Massachusetts. It's nationwide.”
Churchwell further noted that Boston Children’s Hospital has begun to address these challenges by working with Franciscan Children’s Hospital to create a local campus focused on behavioral and mental health.
He went on to express general excitement for the future of the field.
“We're at the cusp because of the work that's happened before us in terms of the human genome project, the work that's happening in gene therapy and stem cell therapy, [and the] creation of new devices for care of children that are going to really change how we practice over the next 10 years,” Churchwell said. “It's going to be rapid. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be phenomenal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anthea D. Butler, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, delivered the Harvard Divinity School’s Greeley Lecture for Peace and Social Justice last Thursday.
The Greeley Lecture, an annual event hosted by the Divinity School, has examined the relationship between race, religion, and nationalism around the world for the past five years.
Butler, the chair of the Religious Studies Department at Penn, focused on the transformation of evangelicalism in the United States into a movement that is associated with politics and nationalism.
The discussion was moderated by Charles M. Stang ’97, the director of the Center for the Study of World Religions at the Divinity School.
Butler described C. Peter Wagner, an influential author and religious leader, as a key figure in the evolution of evangelicalism. Wagner founded the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement beginning in the 1990s that quickly grew to attract politicians, including former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin.
“This kind of belief system has begun to infuse the kinds of things that we see from people who were involved in the white Christian nationalist movement and also people who were there at the 1/6 insurrection,” Butler said.
This movement, Butler argued, also gave rise to political parachurch groups such as the organization that prayed in Houston’s Reliant Stadium for Rick Perry in 2011. However, the people in these groups began to be bound together by more than just religion, she said.
“These kinds of meetings bring together a disparate group of people who are not just Christian believers, but they're also political actors,” Butler said.
In recent years, the share of Americans who identify as evangelicals has grown, Butler said — a phenomenon she attributed partially to the growth of “NASCAR Christians,” a term she coined for people who hold Christian beliefs but do not regularly attend church.
“My sense is that these are the people who are identified as evangelical Protestants now, because they see something that marries both their religious beliefs and their political beliefs, and your nationalistic beliefs that Donald Trump identified with,” she said.
With complicated factors such as the meshing of religion and politics, the redefining of evangelicalism, and the interplay between nationalism and race, Butler said it is necessary to reexamine evangelicalism with a sociological and cultural definition.
“If you talk about evangelicalism as merely a theological movement, you miss the point,” she said. “It is not that anymore.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers, lawyers, and physicians discussed the ethical implications of using smart devices to collect data for diagnosing medical conditions in a virtual panel hosted by the Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics on Friday.
The panel — which consisted of University of Florida law professor Barbara J. Evans and University of Pennsylvania medicine professor Jason H. T. Karlawish — was moderated by David A. Simon, a research fellow at the Petrie-Flom Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics Center at Harvard Law School.
Karlawish opened by describing the traditional clinical routine for gathering medical history from patients with neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. He said that typically, a patient is accompanied by a spouse, child, in-law, or even a friend, who provides a second account of their medical history.
“We call that person the ‘knowledgeable informant,’ with the presumption that this individual has witnessed the day-to-day life of a patient with sufficient vividness and detail,” Karlawish said.
“The history we’ll get from them will inform us about whether the person or the patient has cognitive impairment,” he added.
However, Karlawish said a smart device could serve as an alternative to this “knowledgeable informant.”
“Alexa is just one example of technologies that begin to slip into the role of the knowledgeable informant. What Alexa is able to do is what that spouse does, which is watch the person, monitor their daily function,” Karlawish said.
Karlawish acknowledged such devices can also pose threats to a patient’s independence by discussing the ethical concerns of Alexa monitoring patients.
“You begin to see how these technologies become means to threaten someone's independence, someone's self-determination, their ability to live the way they want to live because the technology is being used to detect there’s some problems,” Karlawish said.
Evans said there is a trade off between protecting patient privacy and reaping the potential benefits of data sharing, which have varying importance in different settings. Sharing has a higher value in clinical healthcare due to the urgency of the situation, according to Evans.
“The purpose of the encounter is to keep someone alive or protect their health, so it's vital interests that are at stake,” she said. “There's a higher value in sharing the data than in other settings.”
Evans also discussed the utilitarian nature of medical privacy law, which she said may be unexpected as it does not closely resemble research ethics.
“It’s very utilitarian and that surprises people because we hope medical privacy law for clinical health care looks like research ethics, and it doesn't,” said Evans.
Nonetheless, Evans said data collected from consumer devices may not be reliable nor accessible, given their primary role as diagnostic devices.
“I worry about a diagnostic tool that might be learning what normal cognitive function is from a sample of people who use digital assistants,” Evans said. “I’m also concerned how many poor people are in the sample of data collected from these devices.”
Despite these concerns, Karlawish highlighted the crucial role technology has played in treating his neurological patients.
“I have patients who hold up their smartphone and say, ‘Without this, I’d be lost quite literally because the smartphone gives me the directions to get to someplace,’” he said.
Evans also said voice-powered digital assistants can promote “autonomy” in addition to collecting data.
“A digital assistant could help families pick up on signs that a new care arrangement may be needed,” Evans said. “You can envision a technology that would assess the competency of the person using a device and maybe disable some spending and functions when it’s not appropriate.”
Karlawish said he sees the utility of technology in future disease diagnosis, though not without modifications.
“I’m bullish about technology for detection and monitoring. I’d love it integrated into the healthcare system, but I want that healthcare system that humans can use and use it well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The high-profile trial of Harvard professor Charles M. Lieber has brought federal research policies back into public scrutiny, but policy experts say that rigorous federal disclosure requirements for funding sources and international activities have causes that extend far beyond the courtroom.
A federal court found Lieber guilty in December of tax fraud and lying to authorities investigating his involvement with the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese government recruitment program that aims to attract foreign scholars. Jurors at the trial heard testimonies by investigators for the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health, which granted millions to Lieber for his research.
Lieber’s case marked a high-profile win for the Department of Justice’s China Initiative, which seeks to combat “Chinese national security threats” including economic espionage — the theft of research and policy information.
According to Sheena Chestnut Greitens, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s school of public affairs, the Department of Justice’s prosecution of scholars in violation of compliance regulations is only one facet of the federal government’s wider approach to preventing conflicts of interest or commitment in academic research.
“I think it’s a mistake to focus solely on the China Initiative without placing it in the context of larger shifts in federal policy, of which DOJ is only one part,” she wrote in an email.
In January 2021, the Trump administration issued the National Security Presidential Memorandum–33, which set out to bolster federal conflict of interest and conflict of commitment disclosure policies against “foreign government interference and exploitation.”
A year later, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released guidance for federal agencies for the implementation of NSPM-33. Among other objectives, the guidance aims to standardize disclosure policies and consequences for their violation across agencies.
The guidance released by the WHOSTP, Greitens noted, differs from the China Initiative’s prosecutorial approach by aiming to set and clarify consistent standards for disclosure.
“The WHOSTP-led effort, combined with some efforts in Congress, is a systematic attempt to tighten disclosure, conflict of interest, and conflict of commitment policies that have long been inconsistent across funders, universities, and individual units within those universities,” she wrote.
According to the NIH Deputy Director for Extramural Research Michael Lauer, who testified at Lieber’s trial, the NIH’s grant policies and disclosure regulations have been in place for years. The NSPM-33 is meant to be a “clarification document” on these policies for administrators and researchers, he said.
“What’s new is that we have discovered that there have been a fairly large number of scientists who had other forms of financial support for their research or who had financial conflicts of interest that were not being disclosed,” Lauer said. “As responsible, accountable stewards of taxpayer monies, we are doing what we need to do to address those compliance violations.”
Lauer said that the NIH is working with WHOSTP, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the DOD to improve the communication of disclosure policies in an effort to help prevent researchers and academic institutions from violating compliance regulations.
“We’re working all together because we want to make sure that the messages that we are sending are coherent and appropriate,” he said.
Bindu R. Nair, the deputy director for basic research in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, said the DOD has added clarifying language on grant application forms to ensure researchers realize they must disclose both their current and pending support sources.
Nair added that these efforts are not indicative of new requirements but are meant to “strengthen” current practices.
When it comes to universities like Harvard, NSPM-33 stipulates that institutions receiving more than $50 million in annual federal funding must have their own research security program to address cybersecurity and foreign travel risks.
According to Nair, NSPM-33 serves to eliminate confusion and communicate clearly to researchers the regulations they need to follow.
“Whether you’re applying for a grant from DOD or NSF, the burden to you should be minimized,” she said.
Nair added that individual criminal cases, like that of Lieber, are functionally separate from the DOD’s work.
“The Lieber case — the other cases that are going on around the country — those are criminal prosecution cases,” she said. “Of course, that’s bad behavior. There’s no question about it, but what we’re trying to do is create an understanding of what ethical behavior should look like.”
According to former U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew E. Lelling, who originally brought forward the case against Lieber, the case acts as an example of the potential consequences of violating disclosure regulations.
“Academic researchers across the country are now painfully aware of the potential consequences of lying about foreign connections, so if the federal government was looking for deterrence, deterrence has been achieved,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much like its previous meeting against Penn (9-12, 4-5 Ivy League), Harvard (12-10, 6-4) fell down by a wide margin early and staged a furious late rally in the pivotal conference matchup at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday. However, the Crimson was unable to replicate the successful comeback it made on Jan. 29, eventually falling to the Quakers in overtime by a score of 87-78.
Harvard’s tandem of junior guard McKenzie Forbes and first-year guard Harmoni Turner had one of its most productive games of the season, scoring 30 and 23 points, respectively. Senior guard Tess Sussman, junior guard Maggie McCarthy, and Turner each tallied seven rebounds on the day, while McCarthy recorded a career-high eight steals.
The day was commemorated as KDS Day in celebration of the team’s decorated coach, Kathy Delaney-Smith, the most successful coach in Ivy League history. The gym was filled with children, parents, and students alike dawning shirts with Delaney-Smith’s signature motto, “Act as If”. Despite the heartbreaking loss, joy filled Lavietes Pavilion as the crowd reminisced about Delaney-Smith’s career and the legacy she has built in the storied arena.
“I love coaching. I’m one of those lucky people that loves my job,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Harvard] was a special place because of the people. I love my student athletes, that’s why I’m here and that’s why I stayed here.”
Early on, Harvard struggled in its effort to reward Delaney-Smith with a win in her penultimate regular season home game, with the Quakers jumping to a quick 6-0 lead. Forbes ignited the Crimson’s offense, scoring a tough layup and three-pointer to make it a one-point game. The teams traded baskets until Turner muscled her way for a contested layup that evened the game at 11-11. Then, Penn sophomore forward Jordan Obi took over, completing a solo 8-2 scoring run that gave Penn a 19-13 advantage after one quarter.
Penn carried its dominance into the second quarter, outscoring Harvard 22-13 in the period. Forbes opened the scoring with a turnaround jumper over Obi, but the Quakers responded with six unanswered points to earn its first double-digit lead of the game, 25-15. Forbes connected with McCarthy for a rainbow three-pointer, only for Obi to return the favor, nailing a stepback three in Forbes’ face. Penn junior guard Kayla Padilla converted a tough and-one, followed by a Forbes three pointer, then Padilla responded with a three of her own, ballooning Penn’s lead to 34-21. The Quakers continued their rally, pushing their lead to its largest of the night, 17, before Forbes scored the final points of the quarter to go into halftime down 41-26. The Crimson shot just 10-36 from the field in the half, while the Quakers shot over 50% and outrebounded the Crimson 28 to 12.
“I was very unhappy and I thought we were absolutely horrible and selfish in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think my team was ready and then they just didn't play well on either end. We were allowing the middle drive and we were taking really bad shots on offense and no one went to the board except for Maggie [McCarthy].”
The third quarter saw Harvard lock down defensively and follow Delaney-Smith's urgent demands to attack the paint and rebound. The Crimson began the period on a 10-2 run to claw its way back into the contest. Penn’s lead teetered around seven points for the remainder of the period until Harvard cooled down and went scoreless for the final 3:30 of the quarter. Penn capitalized and added two more field goals to widen its lead to 51-40 heading into the final stanza.
The fourth quarter set the stage for a tantalizing Harvard comeback. Sophomore guard Lola Mullaney started the scoring off of a putback layup followed up by a Forbes contested layup to pull within seven once again. Penn responded with a pair of free throws, then Harmoni Turner took over. Turner knocked down a deep, moving three-pointer and back-to-back midrange jumpers, cutting the deficit to 58-52.
Penn clung onto its lead, trading baskets with Harvard until back-to-back field goals from Forbes and Turner pulled the Crimson within four. Harvard struggled to get closer as Penn benefitted from numerous foul calls, allowing it to extend its lead to 72-65 with a minute left. All seemed lost for the Crimson, but Forbes stepped up and led the team on a tear.
First, she knocked down a three-pointer off of a screen by Sussman. With less than a minute remaining, Harvard was forced to play the foul game and hope that Penn missed its free throws. Luckily for the Crimson, the Quakers split their free throws. Forbes proceeded to march down the court and connect on another three-pointer; this time, she was fouled, allowing her to convert a four-point play that sent the crowd roaring and make it a one-point game.
The Quakers made their next two free throws, prompting Delaney-Smith to call a timeout with 14.9 seconds left. Off the out-of-bounds play, Turner missed a contested three pointer, but Forbes corralled the offensive rebound and dished it to Mullaney, who hit a game-tying three-pointer from several feet behind the three-point arc. Pandemonium broke out in Lavietes Pavilion as Harvard forced overtime.
“When the time was running down, I just knew [that] someone has to be aggressive,” said Forbes when asked about her thought process late in the game. “It doesn't necessarily mean I’m going to shoot it every time… it means try to attack, try to find people, and then when I did have a shot, [I] take it with confidence.”
The game would not have the fairy tale ending that the Crimson had hoped for. The team ran out of gas in OT, as Penn’s tandem of Padilla and Obi embarked on a 10-0 run. McCarthy found Forbes wide open at the top of the key for a three-pointer, but that ended up being the Crimson’s only basket in OT, as the team fell 87-78 to its conference rival.
The defeat evened the season series between the two programs and ended the Crimson’s five-game winning streak. Harvard squandered its opportunity to move into the outright third-place standing in the Ivy League, where it now remains tied with hated rivals Yale for the spot. The team will travel to New York to battle against Columbia and Cornell next weekend.
