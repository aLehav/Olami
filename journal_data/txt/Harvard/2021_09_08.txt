After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A24’s latest film, “The Green Knight,” draws inspiration from the late 14th century poem “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight” ... and some other unexpected places, too. It builds on key elements of medieval lore — like Arthurian adventure, sensual romance, and magic with questionable intention — with a definitively modern style. The film keeps a lot of its source material intact: King Arthur’s nephew, young Gawain, engages in a Christmas game with the mythical Green Knight wherein he beheads him, and as a result must allow the Green Knight to do the same to him one year later. Although the original poem has no known author, the film adaptation is undeniably saturated with the influence of director David Lowery, whose background as a contemporary film director (not an Arthurian-era writer) clearly informs the storytelling. This is evident in the myriad references to cinematic favorites of Lowery; for example, he pays homage to Ron Howard’s “Willow” in an inspired shot of a skeleton swinging in a cage as the road symbolically splits before Gawain.
Lowery’s signature, then, is written in bold print all over the film. But so is that of Dev Patel, who commands the screen as Sir Gawain. He is perfect for the role; when we meet him, he is blithely boyish but in want of manhood, and the authentic desperation with which he searches for “greatness” establishes him as a heart-wrangling hero. Indeed, the palpable honesty of his performance as Gawain casts a compelling lens over the narrative, indelibly transforming it into a coming-of-age story. In his recent work (like 2016’s “Lion” and 2018’s “Hotel Mumbai”), Patel has demonstrated a mastery of his craft that is also on full display in “The Green Knight” — his charisma is potent but not patronizing, his emotion raw but never reckless.
And how often is it that we get to see an actor of South Asian heritage play a medieval hero? And another play an immensely powerful witch? Not often, which is why it is so integral to note Dev Patel’s casting, as well as that of Sarita Choudhary, who plays Morgan Le Fay (Gawain’s mother/King Arthur’s half-sister, and the witch without whom the story would not exist).
Indeed, Choudhary’s depiction of Morgan Le Fay is captivating, in that her intentions can never be clearly defined. In the opening few scenes it is revealed that, through slightly terrifying magic, she plays a part in the Green Knight arriving at King Arthur’s Christmas dinner, thus kickstarting the plot of the film and putting her son’s life at risk in the process. Does she do so as a loving but exasperated mother, looking to push her boy out of the house and into the real world? Or does she do so out of malevolent intent? Or, in true tiger-mom fashion (i.e., beyond any moral explanation), does she act with the aspiration that her son may sit on King Arthur’s throne? This ambiguity continues throughout the movie, in a manner well-aligned with the inconsistent pattern of Morgana’s depiction in mythology: a healer sometimes, but a source of great evil at others.
Where Lowery again breaks from tradition, however, is with the Green Knight, himself, stoically (and, at times, comedically) played by Ralph Ineson. The poem’s Green Knight is just that: a sophisticated, jewel-laden, silky-cape-wearing knight — whose skin just so happens to be bright green. The film’s version, however, is far wilder and far more complex: Ineson (through stunning makeup and design work) is crowned with ornate branches, his beard composed of twigs, his armor an amalgamation of leaves and ivy. It is as though he is an extension of the Earth itself, wild and intensely arresting. This imagery is especially clear in a shot toward the end of the film, one year after the initial fateful Christmas, when Gawain finally finds his way back to the Green Knight, who is seated in a “throne” of branches: He appears intertwined with the throne, and with the roots of the trees around him.
This depiction of the Green Knight is overtly pagan, which provides sharp contrast to the ultra Christian King Arthur and Queen Guinevere — a move that seems intentional from Lowery. Indeed, his version of King Arthur — played by Sean Harris — is weak, very much toeing the line between life and death. Harris does bring a sense of warmth to the role (a particularly beautiful scene where he gently washes Gawain’s face comes to mind), but that doesn’t overshadow his frailty. The juxtaposition between the pairing of Arthur/Guinevere and Morgana/Green Knight symbolizes the Christian vs. Pagan conflict that is synonymous with medieval times. Lowery is careful to depict the former as a waning empire, and the latter as a powerful (albeit complex) phenomenon.
The well-fleshed out core characters carry the weight of the film, especially as it wanders into more absurdist traces. Along Gawain’s journey to the Green Knight, there are a few encounters that disorient the story a bit, straying just far enough to create a threaded sense of eerie magic, the horror-esque backbone of the film. Some questions are never answered; some are implicitly meant to be understood. But “The Green Knight” makes one thing very clear: Each character (no matter how fleeting), each camera angle (no matter how dizzying), and each storyline (no matter how strange) is purposeful, and it is therefore the viewer’s responsibility to ask, “Why?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Oh! I can’t believe that I almost forgot,” my father, an alum of the Harvard College Class of 1988, exclaimed as he rushed upstairs to get something. The “something” in question was the birthday present he had gotten me. He was adamant that I should receive it before we began the eight-hour, 42-minute drive from Albright, W.Va. to Cambridge, Mass. I had absolutely no clue what the gift was, just that the giver was excited.
What I was handed was a shoebox that had been used to mail the item. Opening it uncovered a copy of The Ants by E. O. Wilson and Bert Hölldobler wrapped in brown paper. For those who were not readers of the New York Times in 1990 or are not fans of organismal biology, The Ants is a 732-page treatise that represents the first complete study of the ant. It won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction in 1991. Beaming, my father said, “I wanted to give you something meaningful. Think of this when you publish.”
At Harvard, my current research focuses on ant behavior as an inspiration for insect-scale robots. My father, now a philosophy professor at West Virginia University, knew of my aspirations to publish by the end of my junior year at Harvard and had decided that this was his way of helping me along. I am in no way ashamed to say that upon receiving this gift, with the accompanying sentiment, I cried.
For many, this is not the kind of story that comes to mind when people talk about Harvard legacy. Instead, they imagine yachts, summer homes, and privilege. With this kind of associated imagery, legacy students can get a bad rap at Harvard. Regardless of concept association, two things do hold true: There are disproportionately more legacy students at Harvard, and many people disagree with the concept of legacy admission.
Despite the current controversy over legacy admissions, the story at this column’s opening can be interpreted as a motivation for those currently at Harvard. A schema on which to build a model of what a Harvard legacy parent can and perhaps should look like. Although many Harvard students do not wish to become parents, for those who do, surely, they have aspirations of their children walking the Yard just as they do now. Like it or not, their children will be legacy admits. With this in mind, let us think about what it means to be not only a Harvard parent but also what we should take away from our time at Harvard.
When and if we one day become parents, we will carry the weight that all parents do. We will be responsible for the shaping of a person’s future. A person that will then be going out into society and contributing something good or bad. We will have to decide which traits to try and pass on and which to attempt to remove.
For those who have children that eventually attend Harvard, there will be even more specificity: Should you tell them which finals club was the most fun (or whether to go at all)? How to get alcohol into Harvard Yard? Which library was your favorite? There is a range of questions that spans the range of people at Harvard. In what is passed down, Harvard’s alumni have the opportunity to set a precedent of what it means to be a Harvard graduate and also a Harvard legacy.
In the story of The Ants and my father lies what I think of as the true legacy of Harvard: a mutual expression of joy surrounding the sharing of knowledge. William James describes a similar notion in his commencement address, The True Harvard: “But as a nursery for independent and lonely thinkers I do believe that Harvard still is in the van. Here they find the climate so propitious that they can be happy in their very solitude. The day when Harvard shall stamp a single hard and fast type of character upon her children, will be that of her downfall.”
Looking back before Harvard, one is reminded of Aristotle’s account of the origins of philosophy, “It is through wonder that men now begin and originally began to philosophize.” Although we are not all philosophers, as Harvard students we each have some amount of wonder. This wonder is what brought us here and, hopefully, what we take with us. The sharing of wonder (and joy) is key to what makes us students and eventual alumni of Harvard.
When we go forth and define what it means to be the parents of legacy children, we have the opportunity to foster lonely thinkers and wonder-ers. To share delight over compendiums of ants, mathematics textbooks, treatises on human anatomy, accounts of the French Revolution, economic studies of ancient Rome. There are flaws that can be found in our institution, and more flaws that can be found in the world at large as a result of its graduates. However, the kindling of joy around creating and sharing knowledge must prevail as the defining meaning and legacy of Harvard College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than a year of classes from afar, the return to in-person academics has been swift: In-person instruction is back, lecture halls are filled, and caffeine-fueled homework sessions in House libraries have begun. We’re even getting daily print issues of The Crimson. Conspicuously missing from this budding sense of normalcy, however, was this year’s iteration of shopping week.
At the start of this semester, instead of bouncing from class to class — sampling flavorful menus of courses in a week-long frenzy of academic bliss — we sat behind computer screens, previewing our courses on Zoom before the academic year began. According to College spokesperson Rachael Dane, the administration decided to hold this “virtual course preview period” in order to prevent crowds in classrooms and accommodate international students who might not be able to get to campus on time.
This virtual course preview, though destined to fall short of an in-person shopping week, was disappointing. The online shopping week offerings were inconsistent between courses, with some offering no preview materials at all. And while we hoped that virtual course preview period would be better, our larger concern is the fate of true, in-person shopping weeks.
We understand Harvard’s public health-related justification for sidelining shopping week this year — on such matters, the University has been right in the past. Yet we don’t want the administration to mistake this acknowledgement of pandemic-time necessities for an indifference toward the future of shopping week: Shopping week must stay long term.
Shopping week is among the College’s greatest differentiators, with 62 percent of undergraduates naming it as a significant factor in their choice to attend Harvard. This is not simply a matter of convenience: The exploration shopping week affords changes in concentrations, births secondaries, and occasionally alters careers.
When else would the Applied Math concentrator with a quiet love for music have the opportunity to sit in on Theater, Dance, and Media lectures for a week, facing no obligation to stay in the class if their creative dreams take on a misshapen reality? When would an English concentrator who wants to challenge herself, but doesn't know if she could truly handle stoichiometry, be able to dabble in the chemical world?
Shopping week not only contributes to personal discovery, but it also serves to protect student mental health and eases financial burdens. It allows students to try out classes without fear of fees and to find enjoyment in their classes, rather than finding themselves trapped in a course that is not a good fit. For students, shopping week is a perfect arrangement.
That said, we understand that on the flipside, for administrators, faculty, and graduate students, shopping week is a logistical nightmare even in normal times. This is particularly true for teaching fellows who can never be sure if their position will remain as enrollment numbers fluctuate. However, we believe there are measures that could be taken to relieve this burden without sacrificing the shopping week for undergraduates. Perhaps this means guaranteeing compensation across semesters for teaching fellows or making it easier for them to transfer courses.
Shopping week is certainly a large undertaking, but as the upperclassmen who have experienced it in person can testify, it is not untenable. Ultimately, faculty, teaching fellows, and undergraduates all have a substantial stake in decisions pertaining to shopping week, and those groups must be equally included in the process of finding ways to ease its burden.
We hope that in a couple of years, when the pandemic is but an ugly memory, Harvard will look back on this piece and see that shopping week is a quintessential part of being a student in this institution. It is a beloved tradition that has helped students for ages; a cherished hallmark of academic life. Instead of dropping shopping week, we want to join generations of Harvard students — old, new, and forthcoming — in shopping until we drop.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall semester did not include a full-fledged shopping week, owing to logistical and safety challenges arising from the pandemic. We understand the necessity of this temporary measure. We sincerely hope, though, that shopping week will not be permanently scaled back — a possibility that the Faculty Council voted to explore in 2018 and is scheduled to receive consideration in the current academic year.
Shopping week is indispensable to Harvard’s mission of providing “exposure to new ideas, new ways of understanding, and new ways of knowing,” and of propelling students to “embark on a journey of intellectual transformation.” Writing as members of different segments of the Harvard community — a current undergraduate and a graduate student teaching fellow — we wish to share our thoughts on the contributions shopping week has made to our educational experiences at Harvard, and on what the community stands to lose if this integral component of the semester is curtailed.
Michael, Class of 2023: Shopping week is more than just an interesting quirk of Harvard; it has had a profound impact on my own academic journey. I am currently concentrating in Archaeology and Physics due in part to the opportunities for academic exploration afforded during shopping week.
I entered college expecting to study physics, and for this reason, it seemed sensible to take a math class in my second semester. Before I officially enrolled, however, I was convinced to shop courses widely. On the Wednesday of shopping week, I found myself on the fifth floor of the Peabody Museum, sitting in a small archaeology seminar. I was enthralled by this first lecture, but I felt conflicted. I recall pacing in front of the Science Center the following evening, unsure whether to enroll in a math course I felt I ought to take, or in an archaeology course I truly wanted to take. I was inspired, though, by one of the principles Harvard represents to me: a foundational appreciation for academic exploration and intellectual curiosity.
I enrolled in the archaeology class and eventually declared Archaeology as my primary concentration. If not for shopping week, I never would have considered that archaeology seminar, and I cannot say where my academic path would have led.
Shopping week also provides students with valuable exposure to fields that are entirely unfamiliar to us, even (and especially) if those fields do not become permanent parts of our academic programs. I recall passing by a friend as she entered a psychology class during shopping week. I joined her, attending a course in a department I had never imagined myself exploring. During that opening lecture, I learned about fundamental aspects of psychology — a subject I never would have encountered otherwise.
Daniel, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences: I must acknowledge that shopping week poses challenges for professors, administrators, and doctoral students. Individuals in these roles prepare syllabuses, assign classrooms, and rush to secure appointments as teaching fellows without knowing course enrollment numbers in advance.
However, there are steps that can be taken to ameliorate these problems — at least insofar as they affect graduate students — without eliminating shopping week. Many third- and fourth-year Ph.D. students in the social sciences and humanities at Harvard must teach two sections per semester in order to receive the full level of “living expense support.” Although these students are guaranteed the opportunity to teach a complete load, they often face major challenges in identifying and securing two-section appointments. Lowering the standard teaching load to one section per semester would make it far easier to satisfy this threshold, even amidst unpredictable enrollments. I imagine that later-term Ph.D. candidates, who are not guaranteed teaching opportunities, would pick up any remaining sections as an optional source of income.
Even without such a solution in place, shopping week’s impact on the quality of undergraduate education at Harvard is far too valuable to give up. The benefits I derived from shopping week during my undergraduate years are similar to the ones Michael has described above. Courses that I visited on a whim at the start of each semester ended up introducing me to new areas of study and challenging me to think in ways I had never envisioned before. These courses were impactful precisely because they were not what I would have chosen on the basis of preexisting interests. Shopping week gave me freedom to forge new paths for myself, but it did so, paradoxically, by allowing me to encounter and be drawn in by topics, questions, and ideas I could not have thought of on my own.
Some of my most rewarding experiences as a teaching fellow have involved working with students who discovered during shopping week that they had the opportunity to take — and that they felt truly excited to take — courses in understudied areas of the humanities. These experiences give me the opportunity to share the topics and texts I love most with students who might otherwise not come across them. For an aspiring scholar, this is the ideal job. By fostering this form of teaching, shopping week helps disseminate academia’s trove of specialized and obscure, yet captivating and transportive knowledge to curious non-specialists.
Michael and Daniel: We believe shopping week is one of the simplest and most concrete ways in which Harvard shows its dedication to its students, but also one of the most important. We hope that it will continue to enrich the educations of future Harvard students, as it has enriched ours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EMPOWER, a Harvard Medical School-based initiative’s digital mental health care training platform, bolstered systems of psychosocial care in both the U.S. and India during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The initiative was launched in 2019 to address global mental health disparities. The program is curating an online curriculum to train mental health workers — including front-line and community health workers — in the development and delivery of psychological therapies.
According to Anant Bhan, a principal investigator of the group's operations in India, the initiative trains community health workers there through educational modules, workshops, and videos, in order to expand local access to care for common mental conditions, particularly depression.
“What is more practical is to actually have a lot of frontline health care provision,” Bhan said. “Of course, you will always need psychiatrists and psychologists, perhaps for severe mental disorders, etc., but a lot of common mental disorders should be handled ideally at the community level.”
HMS professor of Global Health Vikram Patel, who heads the group, said in an interview in June that his growing frustrations with “singularly unsuccessful” advances and “impossibly difficult barriers” to mental health care among disadvantaged populations in developing countries motivated him to help develop the initiative.
“The idea behind EMPOWER was to scale up the innovative ways that we know can address these barriers that have also emerged, to a large extent, from the Global South,” Patel said.
The group's virtual training platform uses new technologies, including virtual and augmented reality and natural language processing, to help train health care providers in various evidence-based behavioral treatments.
The Medical School nonprofit also hopes to expand its virtual training and interventions to health systems in countries beyond the U.S. and India, according to John A. Naslund, a management committee member and HMS instructor in Global Health and Social Medicine.
“What's exciting about EMPOWER is that it builds on this foundation of work in India to try to scale this on a global level — not just in one district and one health system in one state in India, but thinking how can we do this in multiple states in India,” Naslund said. “That’s one key aspect of our work, and then also in health systems in the United States and other countries.”
In June, the mental health initiative became a partial recipient of a $10 million Lone Star Prize, a Texas-based competition launched to fund efforts to build healthier communities, enabling the initiative to expand and scale up its operations in Texas.
The initiative’s digital format has been particularly useful in India, allowing work to continue despite the devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic there in May.
Ravindra Agrawal, a principal investigator of the initiative in India, called EMPOWER’s digital work “Covid-proof.”
“If the entire focus was on in-person training, then that would have obviously completely stopped,” he added.

Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk Gersen filed a brief last month on behalf of an anonymous federal courts employee in a case that could overhaul the way the federal judiciary handles allegations of harassment within its own halls.
Referred to as Jane Roe to protect her identity, the former assistant federal public defender in North Carolina sued the government in March 2020 claiming that the U.S. federal judiciary’s internal process for addressing reports of sexual harassment violates Due Process and Equal Protection under the Constitution.
Roe alleges that judicial officials failed to properly investigate her allegations of sexual harassment by a superior, forced her to continue to work with the alleged harasser, and spread false rumors about her that jeopardized her career prospects.
A federal judge in North Carolina dismissed the suit last December. Gersen is serving as Roe’s lead counsel on appeal to the Fourth Circuit.
The government has until later this month to file a response to the appeal.
Gersen said that after becoming familiar with the case, it was evident that the federal judiciary’s internal mechanisms for processing and addressing reports of harassment and misconduct were neither transparent nor fair.
“Looking at the facts of this case, it was very clear to me that what she was alleging was that she had been put through an extremely unfair process that was biased and didn’t have the basic indicia of fairness that the judiciary would certainly expect [from] other institutions that they sit in judgment of every day,” Gersen said.
In addition to Gersen’s representation, Roe has the support of four amicus briefs — written by members of Congress, two constitutional law professors, dozens of organizations, and a law firm, respectively.
Shea M. Holman, director of law and policy at The Purple Campaign, an organization dedicated to combating workplace harassment which helped file an amicus brief on the case, said that the court’s decision could have lasting implications for employees of the federal judiciary who report any form of harassment or discrimination.
“What’s important is that when Roe attempted to use the internal mechanisms that the federal judiciary currently has in place to report the conduct that she was subjected to, she wasn’t taken seriously in this process,” Holman said.
Instead of having Title VII protections, like most employees in American workplaces, Roe had to use the Fourth Circuit’s mandatory alternative dispute resolution process, called the EDR process, according to Holman.
“This process really denies federal judiciary employees basic due process and equal protection rights,” Holman said. “And the person who was the accused party was allowed to exercise authority over the process the whole time.”
“Essentially, the main theme of this amicus brief is that it’s really well past time for the federal judiciary to apply the same standards to their own workplace that it requires and enforces on every other employer in the country when it comes to protecting people from workplace harassment under Title VII,” Holman added.
Gersen said that when she learned of the case — which was brought to her attention by a former student — she recognized its relation to her own legal focus on what it means for institutions to be “fair,” and her work on institutions’ responses to sexual harassment, sexual assault, sex discrimination, and race discrimination.
“Having been really steeped in the issue of fair process for investigating and adjudicating a sexual harassment accusation, when I saw this case, I understood that this was exactly what this case was about,” Gersen said.
Deeva V. Shah, an associate at Keker Van Nest & Peters, a law firm which wrote an amicus brief on the case, said that while processes for addressing misconduct and harassment in the judiciary have improved, they remain insufficient.
“We still don’t think that the current procedures are enough to really remedy — incentivize reporting when people are faced with misconduct as employees of the federal judiciary,” Shah said.
The amicus brief Shah helped write, she said, demonstrates that instances of harassment and misconduct in the federal judiciary are not isolated incidents, an assumption that can discourage individuals from coming forward.
“What ends up happening is that anytime there is public knowledge of any allegation of misconduct, people are very quick to say, ‘Well, there’s one bad apple,’” Shah said. “So the brief we wrote on behalf of 26 current and former employees of the judiciary was meant to highlight that this is not a one-off issue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first on-campus protest in 10 months, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard held a rally calling for Harvard to divest from fossil fuels on Tuesday afternoon.
Roughly 80 student protestors with Divest Harvard — a student organization calling for the University to sell its investments in the fossil fuel industry — staged a “visual waterline” outside University Hall to represent the rally’s focus on rising sea levels, floods, and hurricanes that have hit the United States in the past two months. Students lined up outside the building holding up a blue sheet to represent water levels.
In front of the John Harvard statue, students held several banners and signs with slogans in support of divestment. “Harvard’s gates can’t keep out rising tides,” one poster read.
In total, six current and former students delivered speeches and shared with attendees how the climate crisis has touched their own communities. Many of the speeches ended with a direct call for the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Harvard Corporation to dump the endowment’s holdings in fossil fuel stocks and options.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the rally.
Suhaas M. Bhat ’23-’24, who has been involved in the divest movement for two years, said in an interview at the rally that he is frustrated with institutions’ failures to act to mitigate the effects of climate change.
“I go to Harvard, and I strongly believe in this institution’s mission; I very firmly believe that Harvard is one of the greatest forces for intellectual good on earth,” Bhat said. “That being said, I think that Harvard’s current investment in fossil fuels is this utterly disgusting moral failure, and I believe in Harvard so strongly that I feel compelled to say something.”
Mai N. X. Hoang ’25, who was one of the speakers at the rally, said she chose to join Divest Harvard after learning Harvard has not fully disclosed the details of its holdings in the fossil fuel industry. The University’s investments in fossil fuels totaled less than 2 percent of its $41.9 billion endowment at the close of fiscal year 2020.
During her speech, Hoang shared how a village in her home country of Vietnam turned to solar power and renewable energy while facing climate challenges such as heat waves and rising sea levels.
“They made the sustainable choice, and that’s what we’re calling on Harvard to do,” she said.
Ashley R. Johnson ’25 said she shares Hoang’s concerns about the University’s transparency.
“For so many people, including current students and students in high school, Harvard is a dream school, and I think it’s disgusting that so many people glamorize the school when they have no idea what they do behind the scenes,” she said.
Another freshman who joined the rally, Carter G. Demaray ’25, said he hopes University administrators realize Harvard Divest is not going away.
“They can’t wait us out,” he said. “They can’t try and co-opt the movement by saying, ‘Oh, wait another 30 years.’ We want it now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number of undergraduates living off campus this semester doubled compared to typical years, according to data provided by the College.
Roughly 100 undergraduates forgo Harvard residential housing in a typical year; this semester, 265 undergraduates have opted to live off campus, College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed response to a Crimson request for housing data.
To be sure, more than 96 percent of College students have still chosen the Harvard residential experience, which includes the upperclassman housing system, Annenberg dining hall, and social events.
But students interviewed for this article who are living off campus said the coronavirus pandemic has led them to see the benefits of living outside of Harvard.
“It’s a different landscape now in this sort of post-Covid Harvard,” Herkus Gudavičius ’21-’22 said. “I think more people are considering off campus an option.”
Sabrina I. Ferrer ’21 is living in an apartment in Central Square this semester — the same one where she took online classes last spring. Though Harvard announced in May that it would reopen its undergraduate housing at full capacity, Ferrer said she renewed her lease off-campus for the fall due to uncertainty of on-campus living restrictions.
“For example, you set up your dorm, but if you ever test positive, then you’re moved to an isolation house,” she said. “I didn’t really want to have to be moved from one dorm to like a block down until I tested negative or something like that, where I can’t really cook for myself or order Uber Eats.”
Trevor W. Bishai ’21-’22, who is living in Inman Square this semester, said the unpredictability of the pandemic contributed to his decision not to move back to campus.
“Knock on wood, this doesn’t happen, but there’s the possibility that Covid gets really bad and we have to shut down again — have a repeat of March 2020,” he said. “It’s nice to sort of not be affected by that and have our own space to come back to.”
Bishai said he still feels “connected to campus,” despite living 20 minutes away by foot. He said he still has access to campus buildings and a partial meal plan to eat in the dining halls.
“It honestly feels very similar to how it was when I was living on campus,” he said.
Ferrer, who took the fall 2020 semester off, said she feels less connected to her house now that many of her friends already graduated.
“As a super senior, I didn’t really have a lot of close friends left in the house,” she said.
Some students said their experiences living independently in apartments last year — when Harvard invited only select students to campus — drew them off campus again this semester.
Bishai, who lived with friends in Somerville last spring, said he and his friends had grown accustomed to living on their own.
“To go from that experience of living with your friends in an apartment to back to the dorms would feel a little anachronistic or just sort of a step back in time, and so we thought that we just wanted to continue sort of being in the real world,” he said.
Ferrer, who has lived in her Cambridge apartment since last spring, also said she had become comfortable in her apartment and had purchased cookware.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard announced Tuesday it would create a new vice provost position to oversee its efforts related to climate change and sustainability.
James H. Stock, an economics professor who has taught at Harvard for over three decades, will serve as the University’s inaugural vice provost for climate and sustainability, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced.
Stock, who served on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama and has taught courses related to climate change, will oversee the University’s climate research initiatives and collaborations in the new role.
Stock’s appointment comes as the University faces continued pressure to divest its holdings from fossil fuels — an issue that has dominated campus politics in recent years.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted overwhelmingly in favor of fossil fuel divestment in Feb. 2020. Stock, though, has opposed divestment, saying at a 2019 faculty meeting that divestment would send a message “of moral superiority.”
“We would send that message not just to the oil executives who spent $30 million to defeat a carbon tax in Washington state, but to the oil roughneck in west Texas, the refinery worker in Louisiana, the long-haul trucker, and the coal miner in Gillette, Wyoming,” Stock said, according to Harvard Magazine.
Harvard administrators have long opposed divestment efforts led by student activists, arguing the University is best positioned to address climate change through teaching and research, along with campus sustainability efforts.
Harvard pledged in 2018 that it would be fossil fuel-free in its campus operations by 2050 and fossil fuel-neutral by 2026. In his new role, Stock will “support the achievement” of the school’s sustainability goals, according to a press release announcing his appointment.
Harvard’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on campus have flatlined in recent years, with little progress since 2016 despite success over the previous decade, according to data from the Office for Sustainability. The University also failed to meet its 2020 waste and water reduction goals, which were set as part of its 2014 Sustainability Plan.
Sustainability data from 2020 has not yet been released by OFS.
Separately, the Harvard Management Company, which oversees management of the University’s endowment, has set a goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
At Harvard, Stock has taught numerous courses on environmental economics and energy policy.
“We have many centers of excellence in climate-related research and teaching throughout the University,” Stock said in a press release. “Our task collectively is amplifying and deepening existing strengths and creating new ones.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part II of our Freshman Survey series. Part I is here. Parts III and IV will be released later this week, along with full data and visualizations.
As admitted students around the world celebrated admittance into Harvard’s Class of 2025, the University boasted about the diverse backgrounds and experiences of its incoming students.
“We have the most diverse class in the history of Harvard this year, economically and ethnically,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson in April.
Despite those declarations, one major subset of the Class of 2025 — recruited athletes — is more predominantly white than in previous years, according to the results of The Crimson’s annual freshman survey.
Last year, the Class of 2024’s recruited athlete class was slightly more diverse than the year before — the proportion of white athletes dropped to 72.9 percent from 74.5 percent, alongside increases in the share of athletes identifying as Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, and Black or African American. This year, however, white students represent 82.9 percent of freshman recruited athletes.
Athletes identifying as Hispanic or Latinx dropped from 14 percent to 7.5 percent this year, while those identifying as Asian fell from 13.1 percent to 8.2 percent. Similarly, only 10.3 percent of athletes identified as Black or African American, compared to 12.1 percent last year, and no athletes who answered the survey identified as American Indian or Native American.
Just before starting their first semesters at Harvard, roughly 78 percent of freshmen responded to a Crimson email questionnaire about their backgrounds, beliefs, lifestyles, and experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The anonymous survey explores topics ranging from political ideology to sexual experience to Covid-19’s impact on their mental health. Of 1,965 students comprising the Class of 2025, 1,537 freshmen responded. The Crimson did not account for potential selection bias in its analysis of the results. Due to rounding, reported statistics may not total exactly 100 percent.
This second segment of The Crimson’s four-part survey of the Class of 2025 examines the academics and extracurriculars of this year’s freshmen, looking at both their time in high school and their expectations for years ahead at Harvard.
The Class of 2025 has its eyes on the Economics, Government, and Computer Science departments — marking the sixth year in a row these concentrations have emerged as the top picks of the incoming class. Students interested in these fields of study constitute over one-third of respondents, with 13.2 percent favoring Economics, 12.1 percent favoring Government, and 9.5 percent looking to Computer Science.
Yet, the frosh broke several years-long trends, including the previous rise of concentrations in the Social Sciences division and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, along with the steady decline in the popularity of Arts and Humanities concentrations. After years of increasing interest, the proportion of students hoping to study within Social Sciences dropped from 39.1 percent to 33 percent, and those favoring Engineering and Applied Sciences fell from 24.8 percent to 21.3 percent. Meanwhile, Arts and Humanities saw a small bump from 6.9 percent last year to 7.1 percent.
Breaking from last year’s results, students identifying as female were more likely to lean towards the Sciences, clocking in at 34 percent interest, and male-identifying students were most drawn to Social Sciences concentrations, with 36 percent. The plurality of non-binary students — 31.8 percent — indicated a preference for Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Regardless of concentration, members of the Class of 2025 look forward to long study hours. The vast majority of surveyed students — 83.2 percent — anticipate studying 20 or more hours each week, compared to 84 percent in the Class of 2024 and 81.4 percent in the Class of 2023.
Interest in secondary concentrations decreased for the second year in a row, dropping down from 38 percent last year to 27.3 percent. Language citation popularity sank to 5.5 percent from 11 percent in 2020.
After finishing high school amid calls for social distancing, freshmen are keeping their distance from Harvard’s social clubs. Interest in final clubs jumped to 33 percent last year following the University’s decision to remove its social group sanctions, but fell to 31.6 percent this year, with only 8.4 percent indicating they were “very interested.”
Interest in final clubs and Greek groups was closely linked to alcohol consumption habits. Students who said they drink twice a week or a few times a week showed more inclination towards joining Harvard’s social scene, with 62.8 percent and 59.1 percent, respectively, indicating interest. Among those who said they never or very rarely drink, only 20 percent and 27.6 percent, respectively, were drawn to joining social clubs.
Recruited athletes were more likely to consider joining social groups, with 43 percent noting some level of interest — 12.6 percentage points higher than non-athletes.
Interest in final clubs and Greek groups also varied by income bracket. Nearly half — 48 percent — of students from families earning $500,000 or more indicated some level of interest, compared to only between 21 and 32 percent of students from all other wealth brackets.
Social clubs were particularly popular among male-identifying respondents — 36.5 percent of males demonstrated interest, as opposed to 28 percent of females and 16 percent of non-binary students.
Recruited athletes in the Class of 2025 are eager to represent Harvard. Nearly all — 99.1 percent — listed Harvard as their top choice university, compared to 76.5 percent of non-athletes. While other students were accepted into an average of 6.8 schools, recruited athletes averaged 1.7.
The proportion of the members of the freshman class accepted into Harvard as recruited athletes — 10.4 percent — stayed relatively consistent with last year, marking only a 0.2 percent decrease.
Athletes demonstrated a higher preference for Economics than non-athletes. Marking a nearly two-fold increase from last year, 36.6 percent of athletes reported interest in the concentration, compared to 10.7 percent of non-athletes.
Only 5.5 percent of Class of 2025 plans to walk on to a varsity sports team. Of this group, male students compose 71.4 percent.
Admitted students from the Class of 2025 had an average SAT score of 1494 and an average ACT score of 34. These numbers varied significantly along athlete and income status. Recruited athletes had an average SAT score of 1397, whereas non-athletes averaged 1501. The average SAT score of students with family income under $40,000 was 1443, while those with a family income of more than $500,000 averaged 1520. Legacy students also had a higher average SAT score than non-legacy students, at 1523 for legacy students and 1491 for non-legacy students.
Most respondents anticipate spending more hours studying at Harvard than they did in high school. The plurality of respondents — 30 percent — reported studying 11 to 19 hours per week in high school, consistent with reports from Class of 2024.
Just under a fifth of respondents — 19.5 percent — reported cheating in high school. The wealthiest students reported the highest rates of cheating, with 25.2 percent of students with families making more than $500,000 a year having engaged in academic dishonesty.
Cheating also broke down along partisan lines. While 19.8 percent of respondents who supported Joe Biden in the 2020 election reported having cheated, 30.2 percent of those who backed Donald Trump said they had cheated.
Tracking with last year’s trends, 63 percent of respondents have experience with math courses at a BC Calculus-level or above, whereas 10.1 percent of respondents have not exceeded pre-calculus level math.
Also matching the Class of 2024, 80.1 percent of this year’s freshmen said their greatest source of pressure was themselves, while 10.7 percent experienced the most pressure from parents or family members.
Members of Harvard’s incoming class packed their high school schedules with extracurriculars and leadership positions. Community service, athletics, and student government were among the most popular extracurriculars for the Class of 2025, with 60.6 percent, 44.2 percent, and 32 percent involvement, respectively. Academic clubs were the next most popular, with science clubs at 26.3 percent and math clubs at 21.5 percent involvement. Music clubs were also popular with a participation rate of 23.2 percent.
The vast majority of respondents — 87.1 percent — reported that they held leadership positions in at least one club. Several freshmen — 2.3 percent — indicated they led more than five high school clubs.
Similar to last year, 10.4 percent of the Class of 2025 led their high school newspapers as Editor-in-Chief, while another 20.7 percent served as student class presidents.
Amid the pandemic, a significant number of students deferred their enrollment by a year. While 11.3 percent of last year’s freshmen entered following a gap year, 21.9 percent of Class of 2025 took a year off prior to starting college.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In front of a large and boisterous home crowd, the Harvard women’s rugby team defeated Mount Saint Mary’s University 53-5 in its season opener on Mignone field.
In its last season, the Crimson (1-0, 0-0 Ivy) took home the NIRA National Championship, but that was over a year and a half ago. Due to the Ivy League’s decision to cancel the 2020-21 rugby season amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Harvard entered the game with newcomers making up almost half the team.
However, the challenges that this situation posed provided new opportunities, according to senior co-captain prop Erica Jarrell.
“We had the opportunity to go back to basics even though we weren’t in person,” Jarrell said. “We were able to work with a mindfulness coach … and we used the extra time when we weren’t together, when we weren’t practicing, to build our mental skills and our team culture.”
As the team found innovative ways to stay engaged and connected while training virtually, a few individuals had the opportunity to train with the USA National Team. Jarrell and fellow senior co-captain scrumhalf Cassidy Bargell were able to practice with some of the best in the nation in Glendale, Colo. The captains will look to showcase their experience and knowledge as the two return to Harvard to lead the team.
Excited to finally be back on campus, the team spent the first few weeks together learning how to work together and re-establish its style of fast play.
“We were thinking of how grateful we were to be back out playing with each other,” Bargell said. “That was really our focus especially after such a long break.”
Practicing how to play fast and as a team translated seamlessly into game time, as the Crimson scored just a few minutes into the match with a try from junior prop Achele Agada. Following a penalty kick and two consecutive tries, the Crimson went into halftime up 22-0 with the home team’s defense reigning strong.
Conceding only five points to the Mountaineers in the second half, Harvard maintained its dominance for the duration of the game. The top scorers for the Crimson were first-year fullback Chloe Headland with 13 points and both Bargell and Agada ended the contest with 10 points. Harvard’s underclassmen contributed extensively to the overall team’s success as well. Sophomore flanker Nafanua Malietoa Fitisemanu and first-year wing Kinai Akina both scored their first tries in a Crimson jersey.
“It was also really exciting to see some new faces make plays,” Jarell said. “It was cool to see the finishing capabilities of the new teammates.”
Overall, the team played cohesively and effectively, with many tries coming from efforts by multiple players, rather than scores coming solely from individuals breaking through lines of defense.
The Harvard fan section showed up in droves to support the returning NIRA champions. Mignone Field featured an electric atmosphere on the first Friday of the school year, and the excitement was palpable on the pitch as well.
“The energy is so fun. And I think that's something that we all missed so much,” Bargell said. “When the crowd comes, it’s just like another step up of energy. It’s so incredible.”
Jarell also noted that the engaged crowd shows the growing support of the sport in general.
“It really gives you chills to think about the support that is coming out for this team and this program,” Jarrell added. “To see that it’s taken so seriously at Harvard, even by non-rugby players, you think about what it means for the sport of rugby and young women that are inspired by it.”
The Harvard Crimson will return to Mignone Field this Saturday, Sept. 11, at 12 p.m. to host the Long Island University Sharks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard was victorious in its first match since Nov. 16, 2019, as it cruised to a 4-0 victory over Central Connecticut State University on Sunday. The four-goal margin was the Crimson’s largest victory since 2016, and its largest opening day victory since 2002.
“It's been two years, so we're very excited,” said senior midfielder and captain, Paolo Belloni-Urso. “We've been waiting for this moment to get on the pitch all together, and it was an exciting game. We had a lot of new players come in, and we had the right kind of chemistry. I think they played well, and we got the result we wanted.”
Harvard (1-0-0, 0-0-0 Ivy) wasted no time in getting on the board, with first-year forward Alessandro Arlotti opening his collegiate account only a minute and a half into the game. Arlotti rose higher than the opposition to connect with a cross from senior midfielder Cornelius Bencsik after the Crimson took its first corner of the game short.
Arlotti had his hand in a second goal less than five minutes later as he found junior forward Martin Vician on a perfectly timed overlap run into the box. Vician would do the rest by firing into the bottom corner to make it 2-0. Harvard showed its speed and counter-attacking prowess on the goal, taking the ball from its own box to the opponent’s in a matter of seconds.
“We have a very talented attack this year — we have depth,” senior striker Alfred Perez said. “We just followed what the coaches told us, and things started flowing for us early.”
It was the mixture of experience and young talent that proved to be the winning formula for the Crimson on the night. In fact, Arlotti was one of nine Harvard players making their collegiate debut. Among the others getting their first college minutes was sophomore defender Nick White, who opened his goalscoring account by following up on a loose ball in the box in the 71st minute to seal the game at 4-0.
“A lot of our players didn’t have college experience, but their excitement and them wanting to play definitely helps us a lot,” Belloni-Urso said. “It gave us the energy we needed to perform the way we did.”
Junior forward Duncan Sutherland also got in on the goalscoring action after Central Connecticut’s keeper failed to get strong hands on a cross just before halftime. With the keeper off his line, Sutherland chipped the ball over the goalie and two defenders on the line to give Harvard extra breathing room going into the half at 3-0.
While the weather got progressively worse over the course of the afternoon, the Crimson stayed disciplined on defense throughout. Junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson racked up seven saves in 75 minutes, before making way for fellow junior keeper Gianluca Trofa, who made one save and maintained the clean sheet.
It was a day of firsts all around for Harvard, as new head coach Josh Shapiro picked up his first win in his first competitive match at the helm. He joins the Crimson after ten years with Tufts, where he racked up four Division III national titles in that period, in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2019.
Harvard heads down to Rhode Island to face Bryant University this Saturday at 1 p.m., before returning home to host Northeastern at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in the first men’s game at Jordan Field in almost two years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, Harvard men’s and women’s cross country opened their 2021 campaigns at the Suffolk Short Course Invite. The event, which took place only 25 minutes away at Franklin Park, marked the first race for both teams since competing for the 2019 NCAA Nationals in Terre Haute, Ind., 22 months ago.
The Suffolk Short Course Invite stayed true to its name as the men ran on a 5k course, typically 8-10k, and the women ran on a 3k course, typically 6-8k. The meet included Brown, Suffolk, and the University of New England. Many top Crimson runners rested during the race as the season ramps up and both teams roll out their talent steadily.
Nevertheless, both Harvard teams placed second in the meet behind Brown, getting their first taste of Ivy League competition. While neither team was at full strength, the Crimson was able to have seven first-years make their debut as Harvard runners, making the day a successful warm-up for both squads.
For the men, two first-years, Andrew Avila and Pierce Cousins made their debut, crossing the line 12th and 13th respectively. For the women, five first-years, Marianne Mihas, Ellaney Matarese, Cristina DeMeo, Jordyn Duby, and Sarah Naticchia, made their debut, with standouts Mihas and Matarese ranking 4th and 8th respectively. Other strong Crimson performances included senior John Fish, who finished in 7th, and senior co-captain for the women Judy Pendergast, who finished in 12th.
The upcoming season represents a large challenge for sports teams across campus, and cross country is no exception. With the Ivy League shutting down sports last year, many teams are combining athletes across five class years, from super-seniors who took a gap year in order to remain eligible to incoming first-years. Many core team members graduated in the off-year, and runners are now in senior leadership roles despite not having seen action for almost two years.
“From the men’s side, we are working with eight freshmen, which is certainly the largest incoming crew that we’ve had in the past few years,” junior co-captain David Melville said. “It has been great having so many new faces this semester, and I’m incredibly excited with how quickly the team was able to integrate the new guys and get everyone moving in the right direction as we head into our first few races.”
On the women’s side, roughly half their team is made up of first-years, adding to the abnormal nature of the program’s return to racing after a two-year hiatus. Team captains on both the men’s and the women’s squads have expressed their excitement with having so many new faces in the locker room and seeing the energy they bring to their respective teams.
“It’s been great to have a lot of new energy on the team and spend some time getting to run with some new faces,” senior co-captain Judy Pendergast said. “After a long year and a half of not being together as a team, we’ve spent a lot of time catching up and enjoying every run together. Things are starting to click again for our team after the first few weeks of adjusting back to college life, so I’m excited to see what will come in the next few months for this team.”
With the program coming off one of its best years in 2019, the expectations are high that this year’s program can pick up where it left off at NCAA Nationals two years ago. The men had their strongest finish at NCAA nationals since 1968, placing 15th amid some of the most talented collegiate runners in the world, and the women finished in 31st, capping off a surprising run based on where they were running at the beginning of the season.
“It’s always difficult to take a lot of information from races this early in the season due to where people are in their training,'' said Melville about the meet at Franklin Park. “Regardless, we had several athletes run very well, and getting experience on what will be our NCAA Regional course in November was certainly good practice.”
While neither Crimson squads ran their whole lineup, all runners were able to see the NCAA Regionals course first-hand, a crucial late-season race for Harvard that determines qualification for NCAA Nationals. Both team captains reiterated their goal to get back to NCAA Nationals and improve on their finish, despite the challenges of this season.
“In terms of goals, we are ready to improve upon our most recent season in 2019. This team is so capable, talented, and hard-working, so I think it’s definitely possible for us to advance to the NCAA Championships and improve upon our finish from 2019,” Pendergast said. “I think once we get some momentum [going] into the championship season, it will be exciting to see what we are capable of.”
Both teams will have many runners make their season debut next Saturday at Princeton’s home course in the famous HYP meet. This bout will see a more complete Harvard squad matched up against tough Ancient Eight competition in Princeton and Yale, a better indicator for the rest of the Crimson’s fall season.
In the 2019 Ivy League Championships, the Havard men had edged Princeton out by three points, and the Harvard women had edged Princeton out by an even smaller margin in an uber tight race that saw Harvard, Penn, and Princeton all within one point of each other.
This year, Princeton men’s cross country is ranked No. 3 in the Mid-Atlantic Region by USTFCCCA’s regional rankings, and the Tigers won their opening invitational at Lehigh with seven of the top 11 runners. Princeton women's cross country is even stronger, ranked No. 2 in the Mid-Atlantic Region USTFCCCA’s regional rankings, placing second at Lehigh last week. The Princeton women are also ranked nationally at No. 24. Yale’s programs do not have the same stature as Princeton’s this season in terms of pre-season rankings, but the Bulldogs remain a formidable rival for Harvard.
With the Crimson men ranked No. 3 in the Northeast Region and the Crimson women ranked No. 5 in the Northeast Region, the matchup with the Tigers is an important early-season barometer for the strength of the Harvard program. The action in New Jersey kicks off at 9:45 a.m. Saturday morning.

Sections
It’s been a year and a half since many of us were last on campus together, so re-introducing yourself to that kid from your Ec10a section is understandable. But once this first week of school grace period is over, you either remember their name or purposely avoid making eye contact with them for the rest of the year. We’ve got you with some tips to help you look like you really care about the people you meet — or just pay attention when you read Flyby articles.
Make It Personal
We know you’re super busy and have new people coming up to you 24/7, but try your best to find something unique about each interaction. Maybe you’re in the same dorm, or both come from the same block in NYC. Associate their name with that first interaction, so you’ll always remember that kid named Matt who you met cramming for the Math 1b midterm.
Repeat It Back
Practice makes perfect, and learning someone’s name is no exception. As soon as someone introduces themselves to you, say it back to them. Especially if you didn’t hear it perfectly the first time, this little trick will help you not only remember their name, but remember the right name (sorry to that girl from Math 1b whose name is apparently not Kenzie).
Exchange Contact Information
Maybe you’ve just had a three hour conversation about your mutual love of Disney Channel Original Movies, or maybe you’re simply looking for another pset buddy. Either way, it can’t hurt to give them a follow on the gram or add them to your contacts. An extra bonus is that by typing in their name, you’ll remember it better. At least, that’s what that one teacher in high school who made us copy pages from the textbook swore. This is also the perfect pretext for getting those digits — for a friend, of course — without making things awkward.
Give Up
Let’s be honest, we’re all a little out of practice when it comes to everyday human interactions. We’ve spent the last year and a half with cheat sheets of everyone’s names labeled right under their Zoom boxes, so these first few weeks will be a tough transition. If you find yourself racking your brains to recall the name of an acquaintance as said acquaintance and their posse stares you down, ready to call you out for being a bad person… don’t stress. Reinvent yourself as one of those people who walks around calling everyone “bud” or “champ,” and never again be accused of not valuing a friendship (if you have any of those left, of course).
These tips should serve you well enough in any dhall or outdoor situation, but maybe you’ve realized that the real problem lies with recognizing the people behind the mask. If so, no worries, Flyby’s got you covered there too!
