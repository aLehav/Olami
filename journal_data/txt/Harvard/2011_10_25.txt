After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The sharp, quick clicks of competitive speller William Barfee’s (Justin S. Pereira ’13) tap shoes usher in one of the most hilariously campy scenes in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.” In the following song and dance number, “Magic Foot,” Barfee boasts of the immense power of his feet, which never let him down in a moment of spelling bee need: the antisocial grade-school nerd spells each assigned word by moving his toes to form each of its letters. The impressive dance number exemplifies the ever-mounting and unrelenting zaniness that is “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.”
Directed by Alexander M. Willis ’14, last weekend’s production of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Bee” in the Agassiz Theatre set the stage for a spelling bee that throws an unlikely group of quirky characters together. While the production had its errors, it more than made up for them with irreverent improvisation, authentic characters, a strong ensemble, and effective technical production.
The musical develops nine central characters, each of which is idiosyncratically impaired. The contestants are: Chip Tolentino (Tom M. Keefe ’15), a former Putnam County champion struggling with pubescent problems; Leaf Coneybear (Robert A. Flitsch ’15), an eccentric kid who spells only in a trance; Marcy Park (Mindy Yi ’15), a perfectionistic polyglot; Logainne Schwartzandgrubenierre (Susanna B. Wolk ’14), the daughter of two gay dads with a severe lisp; Olive Ovstrovsky (Marygabrielle Prezioso ’13), a lonely girl with parental issues; and William Barfee of the “magic foot.”
What makes “The 25th Annual” uniquely entertaining is its audience participation and spontaneity. At the beginning of the show, “spellers” are called out of the audience to participate in the bee with the actors. The cast then makes them sit, dance, and spell among them. The ensemble handled this really well despite some audience members’ being perceptibly hard to control.
The show’s irreverence is best exemplified by the sample sentences presented to the spellers—sentences that vary with each production of the show. For instance, Willis had his cast recite the following sentences for “jihad” and “dystopia”: “Billy, quick, jump behind this Western wall, I think I see a jihad coming!” and “Whenever Billy gets depressed about living in a dystopia, he calls his friend in New Haven.” The cast also audaciously poked fun at the audience.  At one point, one tall and stiff audience member was compared to Frankenstein.
This heightened and ridiculous comedy leaves the audience unguarded when the scenes become occasionally serious. “The I Love You Song,” for instance, explores the unrealistic possibility of Olive’s parents’ being physically and emotionally present. Suddenly the moment seems real, and the authenticity of the character surfaces. Beneath the insanity of the characters, the actors managed to make them genuine in Willis’ show.
Individually, there are a few exceptional performances. Prezioso as Olive gives a stunning vocal performance. Likewise, Pereira as Barfee creates a painfully funny character and delivers an impressive tap number in “Magic Foot.” Ryan P. Halprin ’12 as the resentful Mitch Mahoney—the assigned counselor serving his parole—contrasts so harshly that the only defense is laughter. Finally, Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 as Rona Lisa Peretti—moderator and former bee champion—ties the musical together with unbridled energy expressed through her exceptional, engaging expressions.
The cohesiveness of the ensemble is incredibly important in a show that relies so heavily on improvisation and lacks any clear leading roles. This is where Willis’s strong directing demonstrates itself most clearly. Without decisive directorial guidance, this musical could easily have decayed into chaos, but it did not. The production was staged so the actors could easily interact with, and react to, each other. Scenes changed quickly and naturally, and the pace was brisk. During scenes which brought out individual characters’ fantasies the lights, designed by Gabrielle M. Walti ’14, changed to suggest the unreality of the situation. These cues hit with natural timing.
The musical direction of Alexander T. Valente ’12 ensured an appropriate balance between band and vocalists. For most of the show, the ensemble was strong vocally, hitting harmonies, staying together, and dictating clearly and loudly. It only fell apart in one number, “Pandemonium,” which sounded weak and dissonant.
The ensemble also struggled at times with other aspects. At points the engagement felt shallow and lacking in distinct characterization. Likewise, the ensemble fumbled with freezes during the fantasy scenes, which lacked the crisp synchrony necessary to make them powerful.
While “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” had its noticeable flaws, its strengths outweighed them. The production’s ability to switch from comedy to reality so quickly spoke to the authenticity of its characters. This authenticity drove the message at the core of the musical: that even misfits can belong, and that these characters are more similar than they might at first have seemed.

All men wish they could be Humphrey Bogart—the type of man that ladies swoon over, who can walk away from the beautiful female lead without ever looking back, leaving her with only memories of amorous adventures in exotic locales and one unforgettable parting line. But no one wants this more than Alan, the lead of Woody Allen’s “Play It Again, Sam.” His failure to live up to that ideal provided many of the laughs in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production of “Sam,” which started off slowly but used a couple of stellar performances to offer a very funny look at social insecurity and the ridiculous nature of modern courtship and love.
“Play It Again, Sam,” a production directed by Graham H. Lazar ’12 that ran from October 21 to October 23 at the Adams Pool Theatre, follows the love life of recently divorced Alan (Ben J. Lorenz ’14) as he tries to get back into the dating game with the help of his best friend Dick (Sam R. Peinado ’15) and Dick’s wife Linda (Lily R. Glimcher ’14). All the while he has imagined conversations in his head with the memory of his former wife Nancy (Maya S. Sugarman ’12) and a projection of Humphrey Bogart (James B. Danner ’12) that offers some less than helpful advice on love and women.
The actors have plenty of talent, but it took some time for them to hit their stride. Early on, Lorenz portrayed Alan as a caricature of Woody Allen, a decision which left the character sorely underdeveloped for the first half of the play. As the show progressed, though, Lorenz gained the self-confidence to add his own personal touch to the role, and as a result he became much more sincere and believable. Reducing the role to a cardboard cut-out is a difficult trap to avoid because the character—like most of Allen’s best protagonists—is obviously based on the author. That being said, the character is deep enough to allow for or even demand a personal twist. For large sections of the play Lorenz delivered his lines in an over-the-top New York accent that masked almost all of the expression in his voice. He dropped this affectation during an extended conversation with Linda, and for the first time we really began to understand the character’s emotions.
The real star of the show, though, was Jacqueline J.  Rossi ’12, who played the assorted women that Alan pursues through the course of the play. She oscillated brilliantly between male fantasies of feminine sexuality in Alan’s daydreams and the far more down-to-earth women that he actually met on his dates. The effect was a hilarious contrast that both provided a foil for Alan’s social neuroses and illuminated some of his unrealistic expectations of women. Danner added to the overall silliness of the play with his comically overdone Bogart accent and a great parody of the actor’s trademark swagger. He was especially effective when he showed Alan how to break up with a woman—namely, by maintaining a cool reserve while accusing her of a double murder.
The directing ably reinforced the play’s comedic elements, often by accentuating Woody Allen’s gags with over-the-top slapstick comedy. Lazar made the most of Lorenz’s penchant for physical humor by throwing him over coffee tables and having him fling books around the stage, and it was these scenes that provided  some of Lorenz’s first breakthroughs in character development. The same was true for the rest of the cast, for whom these physical interludes encouraged a move beyond intellectual banter into a more multifaceted exploration of their roles. For example, Peinado struggled to elaborate his character beyond a generic overworked business executive, but he stole the show with his farcical interpretation of a stereotypical wronged husband who invades the stage during one of Alan’s daydreams. His flamboyant gesticulations did not get in the way of some more subtle and nuanced body language during this scene. Peinado did not display this kind of subtlety elsewhere in the play, where it could have helped make Dick more of a standout role.
“Play It Again, Sam” was a light-hearted look at modern relationships with some standout comedic moments. Unfortunately, it took a while for the cast to muster the courage to endow their roles with unique personalities. The result was a mixed bag. Some of the scenes were both brilliantly funny and touchingly sincere, but the inconsistency of those qualities undermined the play’s overall impact.

Writer-director Jeff Nichols presents paranoia in its most raw state in his new film “Take Shelter,” which stars Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain. The film tells the story of Curtis LaForche (Shannon), a man caught between his vivid visions of an apocalyptic future and his daily duties to his wife and daughter. As LaForche floats between his hellish nightmares and the stable life he has built for himself at home, he—along with the audience—is slowly overtaken by an overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety.
Throughout this taut psychological thriller, viewers are tantalized by one overriding question: are we witnessing one man’s descent into mental illness, or something more profound? Are LaForche’s visions mere delusions or genuine portents of things to come—a dire diagnosis for the world we inhabit? With its suspenseful rendering of this conundrum, a resolution that does not disappoint, and compellingly drawn characters, “Take Shelter” is a resounding filmmaking success.
At film’s outset, protagonist LaForche is presented as a wholesome, loving father and husband in a rural Ohio town—one who works hard as a construction worker to keep his family financially afloat and to take care of his deaf daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart). He has a devoted wife in Samantha (Jessica Chastain), and generally leads a fortunate blue-collar existence. But this comfortable constancy is exactly what fuels LaForche’s anxiety, for the more one has, the more one has to lose.
LaForche’s growing fear of inchoate catastrophe is powerfully portrayed through a series of arresting visions that grow increasingly more violent as the film proceeds—an escalation which mirrors the increasing severity of LaForche’s paranoia. Shannon’s rendering of his character’s mounting terror provides a chillingly apt exploration of the bounds of the human psyche, as LaForche scrambles desperately to save not only his loved ones but himself from his perceived horrors.
The visions themselves are part apocalyptic and part sci-fi horror, with all the markings of madness. Nichols juxtaposes these unreal images of unconstrained destructive forces with the mundane images of LaForche’s domestic life. The camera weaves back and forth between storms and showers and drills and sewing machines. On the one hand, these parallels offer an ostensible contrast, but on the other, they suggest that LaForche’s anxieties may have more grounding than is initially apparent. As he himself explains, “it’s hard to explain because it’s not just a dream, it’s a feeling … I’m afraid that something is coming, something that is not right.”
As LaForche descends deeper into himself and slowly disconnects from reality, his only support comes from his loved ones. Chastain provides a sane, rational foil to Shannon’s hysteria, and through her faithfulness the strength of their relationship is movingly affirmed. This familial bond, buoyed by Chastain’s poignant performance, adds a tenderness to the film that serves as a key counterbalance to the otherwise pervasive dread which builds from its very first apocalyptic dream sequence.
Even as they evoke simple delirium, LaForche’s suffocating visions, obsessive desire to build his family a storm shelter, and constant anxiety seem to reflect a greater global uneasiness. In the film’s real world, there are scattered visual and plot elements of a twisted, modern-day Noah’s Ark tale, a foreboding image which leaves the audience wondering if LaForche isn’t actually insane but rather sensing a societal malaise that threatens all.
Through it all, Shannon delicately straddles a fine line between madman and potential prophet, and a feeling of dread creeps up on viewers inch by inch, as LaForche—the audience’s own anchor—unravels. Nichols masterfully marshals ominous music and dramatic visuals to keep audience members on edge throughout the film, and thus draws them into Shannon’s “reality” and blurs their own mental distinctions between the real and unreal.
At the 37th Deauville American Film Festival in France, “Take Shelter” took home the top honors, and it’s not hard to understand why. A mesmerizing thriller that expertly oscillates between the unnerving fear of the unknown and the comfortable familiarity of the mundane, “Take Shelter” is a cinematic parable for our own turbulent times.

At the start of “Margin Call,” the sprawling city of New York is on panoramic display, its sparkling financial district emblematic of a world where dreams are made. But this inspiring image is immediately undercut within the fast-paced trading room of an unnamed investment firm. As it turns out, New York is instead the place where dreams are crushed, for the cutthroat corporations of Wall Street show no mercy. An icy and tense atmosphere pervades the floor of the firm, where something is awry. Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), a risk analyst and career employee, is called into a side room. He is politely told that his cellular phone service will be cut the moment he steps outside the building and that he will be given until 4:47pm tomorrow to take the company’s offer of severance. As it turns out, most of Dale’s floor is being fired that day, as the firm cleans house in a ruthless bid for greater efficiency; it is, as Will Emerson (Paul Bettany), an executive, puts it, a “bloodbath.”
This is the setting within which newcomer director J.C. Chandor places “Margin Call,” a well-crafted boardroom thriller about the fateful decision of a fictional investment firm that contributes to the 2008 financial crisis. With sharp character portraits and a tragic plot arc, the minimalist film offers a poignant reflection on the culture that gave rise to the collapse of the country’s economic sector, and pointedly portrays both the perceived greed and basic humanity found on Wall Street.
In the wake of the movie’s opening purge, one the few employees left standing is Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto). After his boss Dale is fired, Peter plugs some numbers into a risk model his departed mentor had created, and is shocked to discover that the assets on the firm’s books are overleveraged and that their potential losses are projected to be greater than the entire value of the company. “The music is about to stop,” he explains, “and we will be left holding the biggest bag of excrement in the history of capitalism.” This chilling information is passed to the upper echelons of the firm, from Will Emerson to Emerson’s boss, Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey), to Rogers’s boss, Jared Cohen (Simon Barker), and finally to chief executive John Tuld (Jeremy Irons).
In Chandor’s screenplay, each employee represents a different aspect of Wall Street. The aggressive executive Seth Bregman (Penn Badgley) symbolizes all the ambitions of a hot-blooded young man ready to embrace the world of finance in the pursuit of ever-greater sums of money—the sort of person who obsessively compares his own salary with those of his colleagues. Bregman is compellingly juxtaposed with Sullivan, a rocket scientist who turns to Wall Street as his second choice of career. Barker’s Cohen, meanwhile, is the seasoned, sardonic, ruthless executive who has sold his soul to the devil with nonchalant ease. He, in turn, seems to draw inspiration from Tuld, who as the immoral head of the firm personifies the evils of Wall Street itself. Corruption at the top slowly infects the rest of the firm, and in following its archetypal employees, Chandor shows how greed, money, and ambition can ensnare the cynical and idealistic alike.
The moral heart of the film is provided by Spacey’s character, Sam Rogers, whose dilemma serves to humanize an otherwise inhuman financial sector. Rogers’s loyalties to the firm conflict with what he believes is right: if he sells off the firm’s assets—which he knows have no value—to get the toxic properties off the company’s books, he will cripple the market for years. Rogers’ sense of right and wrong is constantly challenged and muddled by his superiors, who seek to embroil him in their self-serving schemes. Tuld slyly notes that “there is a lot of money to be made getting out of this mess,” while Cohen opines that “often what is right can take on multiple interpretations.” Spacey’s conflicted and moving performance, the polar opposite of his comedic work in “Horrible Bosses,” is the dramatic highlight of the film.
Ultimately, despite some overly lengthy technical sections, the film’s dialogue and characterization do justice to its subject matter of the economic meltdown in all its complexity. An impressive writing and directing debut for Chandor, “Margin Call” is a stark and unnerving portrayal of humanity and the corruptions of greed. And while its harsh criticisms of the culture of Wall Street may seem extremely cynical and at times overblown, they also point to a chillingly relevant reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The air is still as the door flies open. Smoke oozes out and a red light shines through. A man, haggard and shackled by chains, emerges and staggers to center stage. His face cannot be seen at first, but when revealed his countenance is a peculiar mix of anger and suffering. It is Prince Segismundo, once the heir apparent to the Polish throne and now imprisoned due to a prophecy foretelling the destruction of the kingdom.
From October 20 to 22 in the Loeb Experimental Theater, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club presented Pedro Calderon’s “Life is a Dream,” the tale of Prince Segismundo (Bryan D. Kauder ’14) and his struggle to differentiate dreams and reality upon his brief release from confinement. Boasting strong directing from Caleb J. Thompson ’14, acting, and technical elements, “Life is a Dream” was able to integrate the antiquity of the play successfully to create a truly modern production without sacrificing the original’s 17th-century ambiance.
The cast displayed an easy confidence that made the material, which could easily become stilted, feel organic. In order to make the play relatable to a modern audience without modifying the inevitably dated dialogue, the production relied on universal themes and unrestrained emotion. Whether in Kauder’s slight caress of Rosaura (Darcy C. Donelan ’14), the spurned lover of Astolfo (Adam J. Conner ’14), or the constant, bubbling tension between Kauder and Joshua G. Wilson ’13, who played his overseer Clotaldo,  the chemistry between the co-stars was the core of the play’s success.
The cast’s understanding of the importance of musicality to verse drama was another key to the production’s engaging quality. Fraught with soliloquies and extravagant manipulations of language, the sounds of the words in “Life is a Dream” are just as important as the interpretation. Originally written in Spanish, the play’s dialogue risks losing some of its natural beauty in translation. Fortunately, the cast took care to create a rhythm that coincided with the tides and ripples of the tone of the play. The words were no longer just the framework for a story, but a musical element that served as the emotional foundation of the play’s grandiose speeches.
While the performances were inspired all around, Wilson as Clotaldo especially stood out. He was a paradigm of bygone nobility and honor, a man who can be cruel when need be but is unfailingly gentle to those close to him.
Wilson’s complete mastery of the character’s nuances was seen in his small actions. His rigid posture and grimace towards Kauder, coupled with a noticeable softness and caution towards Donelan, demonstrated great intricacy. Clotaldo’s plight aroused sympathy: he had a relatability that ultimately separated him from the rest.
The acting was further enhanced by the usage of light. Matthew G. Warner ’13, the light designer, used shades of red and purple sparingly. During soliloquies in particular, the lights contributed to a tense stillness that demanded attention for the ongoing speech. The director’s choice to leave the rest of the cast on the stage motionless and frozen contributed to this ambiance; the speaker’s isolation helped establish an air of significance.
The minimalist attitude towards technical design carried over into the set, which relied purely on the location of the actors and strategic usages of doors and entryways. Thompson was able to create a setting out of nothing. In the play’s final scene, the entire cast appeared on stage together in a carefully blocked array around the fool, Clarion (Joe G. Hodgkin ’12). Thanks to the compelling development of their relationships earlier in the play, even a soundless video of the characters’ arrangement would convey their reactions and emotional stances towards one another.
The theme of ambiguity and uncertainty of reality persists throughout, and a feeling of disorientation and lack of satisfaction pervaded the play’s aftermath. This lack was not due to any failure of the play or weakness in directing or acting. Instead, it was the result of the unanswered questions that the play raises. As in any dream, there wasn’t a bow to tie things up neatly. The audience was left with plenty to think about, as well as a fleeting impression of emerging from another world, when the lights darkened and the story ended.

After months of preparation, the Pudding has produced a script for its next adventure—this time, in a prehistoric, apocalyptic, time-traveling extravaganza. The 164th production of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals (HPT), “There Will Be Flood,” will attempt to dazzle the crowd with spellbinding love, redemption, and mission to save the world.
The challenge of besting 163 previous productions lies with three writers this year, a divergence from the regular two. Brandon J. Ortiz ’12, Ethan D. Hardy ’14—also cast members—and Matthew E. Whitaker ’12 face high expectations. As the trio developed the plot for this year’s production they realized this just might be the last HPT ever made with the prophetic Mayan Apocalypse approaching in 2012. “We figured out what would click with the audience in 2012, and a world-ending apocalyptic prophecy worked,” says Ortiz. The show will feature a group of time travelers who go back one zillion years to prevent the prophecy from being made at all. In the  distant past, the world’s supposed saviors encounter a cast of wacky characters including witless cavemen and false prophets.
In Pudding drag tradition the ensemble will consist of 12 male members portraying six male and six female characters. Although the story arc follows a central character, every one of the 12 characters will get equal stage time. To illustrate a typical character, Hardy explains: “If Gandalf was also Bea Arthur from the Golden Girls, now that’s a Pudding character!” The motley crew of personalities from a multitude of time periods will leave no politically incorrect stone unturned, since as Ortiz points out, “You have the ability to offend with the Pudding, unlike other productions.”
One such potentially offensive character is Angela Foodcake, a chubby angel who falls in love with a painter. Her musical numbers include a Sinatraesque duet with her lover entitled “Crushed by an Angel.” The show’s tunes, with lyrics by Ortiz and a score by Benjamin K. Moss ’13, span a variety of styles, including jazz, Broadway musical, and rap. Ortiz hopes that the music will boast a “fast paced, high energy, and fun style.”
No matter how fantastical the characters may be, Ortiz, Hardy and Whitaker claim that the show remains contemporary and relatable. Ortiz describes Eve Olusion, a character who “after eating an apple from the tree of knowledge, doesn’t believe in creationism and becomes an evolutionist.”
HPT, which begins rehearsing during January break, expects to perform 40 shows in Cambridge. As the show progresses through its constant seven-shows-a-week schedule, the script itself will stay anything but constant. The writers will be ready to add relevant pop culture references as they emerge. Ortiz says that the script will contain jokes about the presidential primaries as well as other current events occurring right up to the night of the show.
With only one word to describe this year’s show, both Hardy and Ortiz thought of the same word: “zany … with 4 zs.” Ortiz said, “there will be more than a joke every second … you will laugh.”

In the early 1980s, Diego Echeverria entered one of the poorest and most violent neighborhoods in New York City with a 16mm-film camera and a mission: to document the lives and struggles of people living in South Williamsburg, a neighborhood known more commonly at the time as “Los Sures.” In the face of gang-related crime and the drug trade, the area’s predominantly Puerto Rican and Dominican residents had created a close-knit, culturally rich community. Echeverria’s documentary—titled simply “Los Sures”—explored the untold stories of the neighborhood through the eyes of five of its residents.
Nearly 30 years later, South Williamsburg has transformed, gentrification sweeping away its earlier identity. Inspired by Echeverria’s original work, a team of documentarians working with UnionDocs—a Center for Documentary Art located in South Williamsburg—have created a new constellation of films about the neighborhood as it exists today. Last Tuesday at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Artists, the Film Study Center and metaLAB (at) Harvard presented “Experiments in Place and Collaborative Documentary: Looking at Los Sures,” a screening of Echeverria’s 1984 original and excerpts from these new films.
One contemporary documentary presented was “Couchsurferz,” a 12-part film collection created by Emma Brenner-Mail, Josh Solondz, and Stephanie Chang that follows their journey as they sleep on the couches of friends and strangers in the community. “We were tired of the same gentrification story,” said Chang, “so we went to 12 homes, sort of as an experiment and a way to document people’s lives.” The result is an intimate and emotional portrayal of the neighborhood from inside its bedrooms, dining rooms, and kitchens. Chang says the film was inspired by a particular scene in “Los Sures” in which a man discusses his life struggles while in bed with his family. “We loved that scene,” said Chang. “It was our favorite.”
Another presented excerpt was “Of Birds and Boundaries,” a film created by Annie Berman, Laura Mayer, and Matt Yoko that examines the traditions of South Williamsburg’s Hasidic Jewish community. Through a series of phone interviews conducted with a Hasidic man she found through Craigslist, Berman probes the romantic, religious, and professional conventions of this deeply private group.
Of the new films presented at the event, “Of Memory & Los Sures” by Laurie Sumiye and Andrew Parsons, is the one that draws most from Echeverria’s original. The work overlays interviews with people who once lived in the neighborhood with animation, photography, and archival recordings, creating a rich and nostalgic portrait of the neighborhood’s evolution. For the people interviewed, the rough days of food stamps and sombre midnight vigils have been romanticized by the passage of time. “Los Sures is tough,” says an unidentified woman’s voice in the documentary. “If you survive this you can survive anything. Los Sures is love.”
When asked what drew him to the project, Echeverria said, “There was a richness of experience. I was falling in love with a place that had a tremendous amount of energy and seeing the ways the community dealt with basic problems of survival.” Through extremely frank and personal interviews with his five central subjects, Echeverria was able to create a movie that was genuine and deeply emotional—and darker than Echeverria had originally imagined. “I would have liked to see aspects that were more optimistic,” he reflected. “It is a very sad film, and I do not think I intended for [it to be that way].” For the UnionDocs contemporary filmmakers, gaining the sort of access that Echeverria had to the community posed a daunting challenge. According to Berman, “we [the contemporary documentarians] always had a sense of ourselves as outsiders. It was intimidating [to] gain as much insight [as Echeverria had].” She added that “as a woman, there were so many barriers to entering [the Hasidic] community.”
Under the guidance of founder Christopher Allen and Programmer Steve Holmgren, UnionDocs will continue to explore the evolution of South Williamsburg for the next three years through a large-scale documentary project to be released on the 30th anniversary of the original movie. “We are trying to embrace the community, looking at people [not only as] subjects but also as collaborators to get a rich sense of what is happening,” says Holmgren. The organization plans to bring together journalists and experimental documentarians to create works that continue to push boundaries. Allen calls the group an “oasis of sincerity in that sea of irony,” in reference to the dominant culture of South Williamsburg as it undergoes gentrification. “I am really happy a new generation is looking into questions that I explored in the old Williamsburg,” concluded Echeverria. Though the original neighbors interviewed in “Los Sures” have moved on and the community’s future remains unclear, the release of these new documentaries suggests that the neighborhood will continue to be a source of collaboration and captivating personal stories.

A moment’s mishearing made the national news last week—prompted by, of all things, the announcement of National Book Award finalists. The murmurs began when six novels, rather than the usual five, were announced for the Young People’s category. It turned out that there had been a “miscommunication,” according to the award’s sponsor, the National Book Foundation. Instead of Franny Billingsley’s “Chime,” the book the judges had intended to include, someone had added Lauren Myracle’s “Shine” accidentally.
“For security reasons, we do everything by phone,” explained Harold Augenbraum, executive director of the National Book Foundation. “We don’t write things down when [the judges] transmit the titles to our staff. And someone wrote it down wrong.”
It was a nightmarish week for Myracle, who was first told her book had been nominated and then that it had been included by mistake, was informed that it would remain on the list anyway, and then was finally asked to voluntarily withdraw herself from consideration—which she did this past Monday.
The story got me thinking about hearing and mishearing, miscommunication, and mistakes. It was striking to me how far-reaching the consequences of such a silly, small error could be, considering that mishearing is usually more of a cause of bemusement than of misfortune.
When I was a kid, for instance, my mother would listen to National Public Radio every morning on her way to drop me off at school. It took me ages to realize what the jingle at the end (“KYW, Newsradio…ten-six-ty”) was really saying—I always thought it ended with “Texan News,” leaving me perpetually puzzled.
As I discovered while reading one of William Safire’s old “On Language” columns in The New York Times Magazine, these kinds of misinterpretations actually have a name. He calls them “mondegreens,” and to him they are epitomized by many a schoolchild’s version of the Pledge of Allegiance’s opening line: “I led the pigeons to the flag.”
The term “mondegreen” has its origins in a piece by Sylvia Wright entitled “The Death of Lady Mondegreen,” which appeared in a 1954 edition of Harper’s Magazine. Wright recalls one of her favorite childhood songs, the old Scottish ballad “The Bonnie Earl O’ Morey,” which she originally heard as,
Ye Highlands and ye Lowlands
Oh, where hae ye been?
They hae slain the Earl O’ Morey
And Lady Mondegreen…
For years, she says, she was taken up with romantic images of a double murder, a couple’s death. Of course, she later realized, the actual last line read: “And laid him on the green.” The revelation of the line as it really was came as no inconsiderable shock to the young author.
Contemporary examples of mondegreens are similarly blithe, if sometimes absurd. “The girl with colitis goes by,” an ostensible lyric from The Beatles’ “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” is a well-known mishearing; another is found in the Rolling Stones’s “I’ll never leave your pizza burning” (I’ll never be your beast of burden). Some seem improvements, or even oddly wise: the slip of the Lord’s Prayer into “And lead us not into Penn Station,” for example.
Such instances of miscommunication are often merely funny or frivolous. They do seem to suggest something more, though—that what we think we hear does not necessarily correlate with any objective reality. Mondegreens are a chance to chuckle over a rather ominous reality: we rely on a system of language and codes that, upon closer inspection, quickly reveals its cracks and flaws.
If mishearing and miscommunication is as old as speech itself, it’s surprising that it took until 1954 to coin a term for a branch of the phenomenon. Perhaps, though, it is only recently that it became so easy to notice when there’s a disconnect between what we hear and what’s really there. Even as our population grows, our number of dominant media sources continues to dwindle. More than ever before, we read and watch and listen to the same things. It is easier now to seek confirmation of what we’re experiencing in others, through a kind of informal fact-checking. As things like music and literature take on global dimensions, we can begin to tell when there’s a gap between what we see or hear and how the rest of the world perceives it; we find truth in consensus. Regardless, these examples seem to suggest that speech does have its limits, shrinkable but not erasable, somewhere in that murky transition from thought to its expression.
These limits aren’t always a bad thing. Sometimes listening can crowd out mishearing, can make misunderstanding felicitous. One of the responses Myracle received following the mix-up about her book, which deals with anti-gay bullying, was as follows: “As a gay boy living in North Carolina, thank you for Shine, which I wouldn’t have known about without the screw-up. You may have saved my life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Living in New York last summer, I found it hard to avoid talk of the long-awaited opening of “Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark,” which finally premiered in June after a record 182 preview performances. These previews were riddled with mishaps, including long technical delays and failed aerial stunts that caused some serious injuries among cast members, many of whom left before the actual opening. By far the most expensive Broadway musical ever produced, Spider-Man will have to become a perennial box-office hit to stand a chance of recouping the $75 million–dollar cost of production. Given the show’s generally negative reviews, the chances of this seem slim, to say the least. Along with its numerous technical calamities, the show’s music—arguably the most important aspect of any successful show—provoked negative reactions from many critics.
There are a lot of different molds into which we could try to fit the motivations for “Spider-Man: Turn off the Dark.” It could be that producers wanted to attract a younger audience to Broadway—an audience whose collective consciousness might never be penetrated by Broadway without such a gimmick. Maybe they were trying to modernize theater to meet the expectations of a general public that is growing more and more accustomed to the increasingly immersive magic of Hollywood, including advanced 3D technology, massive IMAX screens, and breathtakingly realistic Computer Generated Images. Regardless, it seems the ambitious stunts were meant, essentially, to place the viewer inside a high-budget action film. The critical and financial failure of “Spider-Man” suggests not only that this is almost certainly not the most practical strategy for theater to pursue, but also that the most basic principles underpinning this strategy are flawed.
Perhaps the industry would be better served by taking a cue from a similar artistic evolution: the transition that took place with the introduction of the photograph. For centuries painters had held a role not just as artists but also as historians responsible for preserving images of the people and places around them. Their brushes were the most accurate tools for passing on a visual record of their time. As photography emerged, though, their position began to change. Artists were no longer the most accurate, least expensive way to preserve a collective memory. Through technology, a photograph could capture an image perfectly in minutes; artists who stayed true to life were suddenly on the edge of irrelevance.
In response to this dramatic shift in the function of paintings, the art form saw a host of transformational movements from Impressionism to Cubism to Abstract Expressionism. Having been nearly completely separated from its role of portraying the world with dry accuracy, painting became arguably the most progressive art form, the art most associated with the avant-garde, at least in the eye of the general public.
The shift also had implications beyond the realm of painting itself. Musicians like John Cage moved music in a similar direction. His famously silent piece, “4’33””, was primarily a reaction to Robert Rauschenberg’s White Paintings, and both fit with the idea of a conceptual product rather than one with a traditionally celebrated aesthetic. Perhaps musicals could find a way to move in this direction as well, rather than imitating their competition with inferior budgets. A live orchestra, a performance that can never be completely replicated, and an energy that builds with audience excitement—these are things that can never come through a screen. Theater will never do Hollywood as well as Hollywood does—but Broadway has its own perks.
As for “Spider-Man,” I would ditch the high-budget stunts in favor of a stripped-down show with a score I’d be humming to myself for weeks after. The runaway successes of “Spring Awakening” and Jason Robert Brown’s “Songs for a New World” prove this model can work. I still remember the thrill I felt after seeing each of these two shows, and my excitement had nothing to do with the budget—it was and always will be about the live music and the live performances, the magic of Broadway no Hollywood-sized budget can recreate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Blessed Lord, what it is to be old;
Be the teller, and not the told,
Be serene in the wake,
Of a triumph, mistake,
Or life’s rainbows, with no pots of gold.”
I’m standing in front of the tombstone of 19th-century poet David T.W. McCord ’21 in Mount Auburn Cemetery. As I had been wandering the cemetery, a woman asked me if I was looking for any grave in particular.  No, I said, I had just come to the cemetery to explore, and she smiled and told me that McCord’s grave was inscribed with the cemetery’s most poignant epithet. The first verse, about youth, comes from a book of children’s poems; the second, about old age, McCord wrote as a response.
As I continue my walk, I reach a valley called “The Dell,” a favorite spot of frequent visitors to Mt. Auburn. Encased by steep walls and stately oaks, it is the lowest part of the cemetery. It is silent. It is hard to believe that I am surrounded by a city of millions of breathing, crying, laughing, living humans.
I rarely ever feel this kind of solitude at Harvard. There is the constant music of earbuds and street musicians, the fragrance of cinnamon rolls at Au Bon Pain, the sight of a student going from Point A to Point B while gesticulating wildly and holding a Very Important Conversation on her phone. There are meetings, classes, appointments, lunches, information sessions, parties. Stimulation is in high supply.
Two miles away from Harvard Yard, I’m standing among the corpses buried on Mt. Auburn Cemetery’s Harvard Hill. This spot was once the resting place of students and faculty who died far from home. Now the Hill has metamorphosed into the ultimate form of tenure, reserved for members of the Harvard faculty elected by the Harvard Corporation. The tufted peak of Memorial Hall peeks from behind thick oak branches. It is a quiet Sunday morning, and I have chosen to spend it with the dead. Surprisingly, their resting place is not morose. Mt. Auburn shows that a cemetery need not be like the dark burial grounds of film and literature; instead, it can be the perfect place for the young, old, or dead to “be serene in the wake of a triumph, mistake, / Or life’s rainbows with no pots of gold.”
DANCING SUNLIGHT
Most Harvard students will never enter a cemetery. Why would they? From thousands of diverse backgrounds come students who gained admission for being full of life, for their drive toward activity and cravings for new experiences. I ask brightly-dressed Bree Harvey, Mt. Auburn’s Vice President of External Affairs, why she thinks Mt. Auburn is not often visited by students.
“Even though a lot of people know that it is a famous cemetery with famous people buried here, they pass it on Mt. Auburn Street and think that it looks ominous and foreboding,” she says. “Ironically, the big granite gate we built to attract people actually scares them.” According to Harvey, cultural depictions of graveyards contribute to this misperception. Think Sad Hill Cemetery in “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,” or really anything Stephen King has written.
Mt. Auburn is more like a park than a crypt. It is 175 acres of winding paths, dignified trees, whispery breezes, and shimmering lakes. The land, called “Stone’s Wood,” used to be beloved by Harvard students as the perfect place to take respite from the bustle of 19th-century life, and the Cemetery was created in 1831 to ensure that the growing cities of Cambridge and Watertown would not envelop the forest’s beauty.
The founders were successful in their efforts. The sunlight dances through orange and yellow leaves. There are no black, crooked tombstones, only monuments of angels and reeds and even the occasional sphinx. Mt. Auburn looks like a park covered in sculpture.
Interestingly enough, the atmosphere of the rural cemetery is derived from its brethren institution, the public park. “It’s not so much that Mt. Auburn looks like a park, but that parks were created to look like cemeteries,” Harvey says. “When public parks, such as Central Park, started to be founded in the mid-19th century, cemeteries went back to being viewed as merely a place to bury the dead.”
DEATH’S HEAD
Before cemeteries such as Mt. Auburn were created, the dead were laid to rest in burial grounds. The burial ground is a dark contrast to the pastoral cemetery. The Granary, a burial ground near Boston Common filled with American Revolution heroes, is a macabre scene of death. Skeletons line dark gray tombstones and nearly every marker has a frightening  image of a skull attached to wings, called “Death’s Head.”
“Colonial period, they didn’t have cemeteries,” says Robert Allison, History Chair of Suffolk University and an expert on Colonial History. “The Puritans were very clear that when you were dead, your soul is what mattered. It was incredibly utilitarian in that burials were used to discourage disease. Once you’ve been the ground from 10 to 20 years, it was safe to put someone on top of you.” Thus, burial grounds were viewed only as a convenient place to store the dead. “When they dug through [Boston Common] a couple years back, skeletons were literally falling down onto the workers.” There was no interest in mystery or love of nature; insofar as the Puritans were concerned, a burial ground was a only a necessary evil, like a prison.
“Once mortality rates decreased, colonists’ perspective of death was softened,” Allison says. “Places like Mt. Auburn and Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain were created as an alternative to burial grounds, which had filled up through plagues and the harsh life of the early colonial period.” That the peace of Mt. Auburn made me so serene is fitting—it is a place designed to reflect the prosperity of its era.
“When Mt. Auburn comes around, an idea emerges of a pastoral setting where you had a gravesite and the family would go to picnic at that site,” Allison goes on. “[Some families] would own a sketch in the bedroom of the family burial plot at Mt. Auburn. Throughout their week, they looked at the sketch.” This acceptance of death was reflected in the art of the time as well. In the mid-19th century, the city of Boston built a wall around the Granary Burial Ground with the image of an hourglass with wings on the gates. This iconography stands in stark contast with the Death’s Head that adorns the graves.
“Mostly it had to do with the change from Puritanism to Unitarianism,” says Allison, “changing from ‘God is wrathful and thinks you sinful’ to ‘God really likes you a lot and doesn’t want you to suffer.’” The metamorphosis from viewing humans like ants to be crushed by the hands of an angry God to viewing them as individuals whose intrinsic qualities earn God’s favor can be seen not only in the memorialization of those who died in the 19th century, but also in the community conscience of what it meant to be a Bostonian.
“It used to be said there were three requirements to be a Bostonian: you had a reader’s card for the Athenaeum, a pew at Trinity Church, and a plot at Mt. Auburn,” says Allison. In this way, cemeteries are highly representative of their time, designed to provoke a certain feeling, whether fear of God or love of nature. Mt. Auburn was designed for serenity.
CEMETERY SENTIMENT
There exists at Harvard a small group of faculty who show students Mt. Auburn’s beauty and encourage them to explore it. Professor John Mathew, who teaches Freshman Seminar 26y: “Science, History, and Theatre,” discovered the cemetery for himself over a decade ago, and now he guides his students through it when he gets the chance. I asked his freshman students if they had been to the cemetery yet and was met by a resounding chorus of affirmations.
“The deeper we went into Mt. Auburn, the farther down my jaw dropped,” says Jess R. Lucey ’15, a student in the class. “It’s called the City of the Dead, and time suddenly stops even though the city outside is whirring around you.”
Mathew takes personal trips to Mt. Auburn throughout the year, sometimes two or three times per week. “I grade papers there, go there to train actresses, or just to think,” Mathew says. “I’ve honestly have been waiting for eight years to teach this class.”
Some Harvard faculty hold Mt. Auburn in high regard for its role in Boston’s history. Chair of Folklore and Mythology Maria Tatar realized its beauty after a trip last spring to visit the grave of Jeremy R. Knowles, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“[Knowles] was such a charismatic, wonderful leader, and I had been meaning to go for quite some time,” she says. “I’m also a firm believer in facing reality.”
After the visit, Tatar told her children that she’d like to be buried in Mt. Auburn after her death and spoke to its significance for Harvard and Cambridge.
“I have lived in Cambridge most of my life, and think of myself as a dweller of New England,” she says. “Most of the people that Harvard chooses to be buried [on Harvard Hill] have made a huge contribution to the community ... [but] I’m certainly not angling for anything.”
Being buried at Mt. Auburn does not appeal to everyone: it is an eternal association with identity as a Bostonian, Cantabrigian, or Harvardian. “I’ve given my life to Harvard. I do not wish to give my body to Harvard,” said the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, and, true to his word, he was buried in Plymouth, Mass. last year.
DISINTEGRATE TO DIRT
As I walk down the winding paths of Mt. Auburn, my mind is not cycling through its usual rote to-do list. If I lay down on the grass, I would fall into a Rip van Winkle-esque sleep. Each poem or simple epithet seems to take on weighty significance, and the leaves look so sharp that I feel like my seven-year-old self receiving my first pair of glasses.
Mt. Auburn and cemeteries like it were created to stop the outside world of cities and politics from destroying the land’s beauty. They were meant to be visited, to be admired, to inspire comfort in those who sought it. However, it preserves not only a beautiful forest but also peace in an urban setting.
The City of the Dead creates a feel of connection with nature that relationships with people sometimes cannot provide. During my hours at Mt. Auburn, it seemed inappropriate to check my phone, to think about classes, to plan my day, to text my friends. I thought of the hourglass with wings on the wall of the Granary and asked myself if I was in the past—is this feeling provoked from the wishes of the original cemetery architects, or is this something new? How do we view death as a society now, and what will historians say about how people used Mt. Auburn today a century from now?
Part of the future may include an integration with nature even more complete than the early 19th-century movement. “We’re entering a new, naturalistic way of viewing cemeteries,” says Harvey. “Many of the more recent cemeteries preserve the landscape entirely, working with memorials placed on level with the ground. Many people are also interested in the green burials and prefer to be buried in a simple pine coffin or in a shroud.”
On the surface, green burials and burial grounds are strikingly similar. Both places deemphasize the importance of the individual and his or her life. In each case, the core of the ritual is placing a body, unadorned, in the ground, for it to disintegrate eventually into the dirt. Though these are similar goals, the motivations behind them are entirely unrelated. The Puritans disregarded the individuality of the dead as a part of their religious beliefs; those who choose green burials take a similar attitude based on their beliefs about nature. Thus, the constructed elements of graveyards have no single meanings in and of themselves; rather, we appreciate their tranquil beauty according to their unique historical context.

The Arthur M. Sackler Museum turned festive last Thursday, as students partook merrily in the school year’s first of many such nights at the museum. Tables of pizzas, burritos, fine cheeses, and cider flanked the lobby entrance, and the evening light bathed the vaulting and cavernous space in a cozy purple glow.
Aptly named for an October event, “Science and Superstition Night at the Sackler” attracted undergraduates with the allure of free performances, activities, and copious spreads of food. One of many popular after-hours Sackler galas held by student organization Harvard Art Museums’ Undergraduate Connection (HAMUC), “Science and Superstition” gave typically occupied undergraduates a chance to relax, socialize, and, most importantly, discover the Harvard museum and its significant collections.
“The purpose is for students to be able to engage with the museum,” said Museum Educator Akiko Yamagata, the Sackler’s liaison to HAMUC. Current president of HAMUC Shannon M. Morrow ’12 added, “Many students go their entire careers without coming to [Harvard’s art museums]. The goal of these events is to promote and spread awareness.”
“Science and Superstition” struck a balance between being an educational event and a diverting study break, as playfully reflected in its title. Referring to more than its own Halloween-conscious décor, the name “Science and Superstition” also drew attention to the Sackler’s current exhibit, “Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge in Early Modern Europe,” an inquisitive selection of scientific prints and texts from early modern Europe.
The activities held were relevant to this theme, including a scavenger hunt and printmaking. During the latter, students tried their hands at carving stencils of any subject they wished: from casual portraits of their friends to replicas of Albrecht Dürer’s famed “The Rhinoceros.” One of the exhibit’s centerpieces, the print was made after a rhinoceros sunk in the transport from Lisbon to Rome. With no rhino to observe, Dürer drew the beast from nothing but previous description and a sketch of another rhinoceros.
Alongside this lighter entertainment, the evening offered enlightening tours of the exhibit, including one led by the Sackler’s head of student affairs Susan Dackerman. “The guides are a chance for undergrads to actually see the exhibits in a comprehensive way with the curators,” said Yamagata.
Though not explicitly described in the exhibit, the theme of superstition was present in many of its pieces, as Dackerman explained. For example, the Sackler currently holds Jan Saenredam’s print of a whale beached near Beverwijk. An event like the one he portrayed may have been thought to represent a bad omen by early modern Europeans.
Though her tour touched on only a few of the exhibit’s main attractions in the brief time allotted, Dackerman gave thorough explanations and emphasized each piece’s greater connection to its utility and the people surrounding it. One highlight was the demonstration of how one could fashion an authentic sundial out of a print cut-out. Later in the evening, student guide Benjamin B. Wilcox ’13 demonstrated his own guide chops and gave two more highly informative tours for students who came in the event’s second hour.
A common theme ran through Dackerman and Wilcox’s tours: from explaining important inventions to medical dissections, prints were integral as ways for both the scientific and popular community to conceptualize ideas or images. Prints were a way to pass knowledge, to explain that which was not otherwise available or communicable:  a print could show someone a whale or rhinoceros, whether they had seen one in reality or not.
As prints attracted the Europeans to science, HAMUC’s free fete attracted students to the Sackler. Besides Thursday, HAMUC continues to promote the arts, throwing two or more museum nights each year. Lately, as Morrow explained, the club has been posting career-related events and internship lists for the arts and expanding the panels and curator dinners it hosts. The students appreciated the opportunity to explore the Sackler outside its usual schedule. “It’s a challenge to get [to the Sackler] when there are classes,” said Ashleigh J. Cote ’15. “I tend to look out for these events… I come here for the tours [to be] able to see the pieces with someone and then admire them more.”
Overall, the museum setting brought out a convivial spirit. “Science and Superstition” at the Sackler provided a refined rest from busy classes. It appealed to the senses, intelligence, and creativity. Attendees were jostled from one scheduled attraction to another; they toured the third floor gallery, scrambled down for some food and a performance by The Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, and then went to the basement to draw prints. The end of the evening held almost a nostalgic air, akin to that accompanying childhood days at camp with the freedom to choose from a great itinerary of exciting things to do.

Some professors have chairs named after them, but Norman R. Shapiro ’51 has been dedicated an entire table. He can often be found in the Adams House Dining Hall at this particular table—which a couple of students have affectionately named after him—working on his translations of French poetry. It is at this very table that Shapiro translated many of the works which earned him the title of Officer in the French Order of Arts and Letters, which he was awarded last Tuesday by Christophe Guilhou, Consul General of France in Boston, in a ceremony in Adams House Junior Common Room.
Shapiro, Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures at Wesleyan University, has translated fables, farces, and poems by eminent French writers from all eras. Shapiro views literary translation as the ideal form of creativity. “Within the rigid framework of the original, one is totally free to translate as one sees fit while maintaining the message and the tone of the original,” he says.
Now, after decades of doing what he loves, Shapiro has been awarded one of the highest honors that the French government bestows upon artists. At the award ceremony, Guilhou spoke of Shapiro’s impressive achievements; he presented him the award “for a life dedicated to French literature and culture in all of its diversity, and for touching so many students and people.” The Order of Arts and Letters, part of the French National Order of Merit, was established in 1957 for the recognition of achievement in or propagation of art and literature. Recipients of the award are divided into three grades: chevalier (knight), officier (officer), and commandeur (commander). Shapiro’s award is of the officer degree, which is only awarded to fewer than 60 people each year. Other well-known American members of the order include T.S. Eliot ’08, Bob Dylan, Ray Bradbury, Patti Smith, and—Shapiro’s personal favorite—Jerry Lewis.
“It feels a little silly, but I feel it is a wonderful honor and I never expected it,” says Shapiro. His cousin-in-law, Allan Kliman ’54, was not so surprised. “I’ve been saying for years that the French government should recognize Norman,” he says. Kliman continued that Shapiro’s translation and popularization of the works of Jean de la Fontaine, whose fables have been read by most French school children, made the honor “long overdue.”
Shapiro’s work is not limited to translation. “Adams House has been a very important part of my life academically and socially,” he says, and he has had a great impact on the house in both respects. Shapiro officially serves as the Adams House Advisor in Writing and Theater, and also participates in weekly French language discussion tables with students. “He is very available to students and very sociable, always telling jokes,” says Catherine L. Goode ’12. He has also helped her with her poetry, some of which she writes in French. “His constructive criticism is invaluable and really helps me improve as an artist,” she continues.
Shapiro also regularly organizes performances or dramatic readings of his own translations of farces by Georges Feydeau and recruits performers in the Adams House community. “His translations are funny—a little bawdy. [He] brings the wording up to date but doesn’t lose any of the original meanings or situations,” says Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, who has known Shapiro for 13 years. “I have acted in them almost every year.”
Shapiro’s impact extends beyond Adams House and the world of French literature. Yon Lee, the Tai Chi Master in charge of Harvard’s Tai Chi Tiger Crane Club, recalls an incident in 2005 when club members were debating whether or not to visit the Shaolin Temple in China. Shapiro urged them to go “in the name of cultural exchange.” Since then Lee he has sent three groups there to study, and says that both he and Shapiro were appointed as Songshan Scholars by the Chinese government.
According to his longtime friends Alan Hartford, a tutor in Adams House from 1986 to 1998, and Ariana Vora, a current medical school faculty member, Shapiro is “cultured, lovable, erudite, modest, charming, and a man about town.” They say that he is the kind of character that every professor should aspire to be.

October 28-30, November 3-5, 7 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Valeriya Tsitron ’14
Produced by Madeleine F. Bersin ’14 and Gabrielle M. Walti ’14
With a set designed as an interior of a church of imposing Gothic arches, “Dracula”—Bram Stoker’s classic 1897 novel—is cast in dark religious symbolism. It is with deliberate intent that the realm of the supernatural, the unfathomable, and the afterlife are explored in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s adaptation.
The play’s time-honoured plot is familiar. When Lucy Westenra (Mikhaila R. Fogel ’15) falls ill, her friend Mina Murray (Lelaina E. Vogel ’15), suitor Dr. John Seward (William R. Montgomery ’15), Professor Van Helsing (Anthony J. Sterle ’11), and Jonathan Harker (John F. Morton ’15) seek to discern the cause of her ailment. Soon, Mina’s frightful trances leading her to the calls of a mystic creature make it evident that she is under the influence of dark and sinister vampire Count Dracula (Peter K. Bestoso ’14), who has traveled from Transylvania to bustling London. What distinguishes this play from other adaptations is its faithful commitment to this text.
“This [rendition] is much more true to the original novel, and it takes itself a little more seriously,” says Bestoso. While this adaptation of “Dracula” follows conventionality in creating a harrowing and eerily supernatural atmosphere, its images of torment and nightmares also resonate with reality.
Director Valeriya Tsitron ’14 illustrates this close relationship with reality through Renfield (Joey J. Kim ’15), an inmate in an asylum who suffers from delusions that compel him to eat living creatures. “The play seeks to be as believable as you can be with something supernatural. I really want it to scare people with the idea of a man trapped inside his head, because that can happen to any one of us,” she says.
This bone-chilling concept is complemented by a set (Brenda Lin ’12) inspired by M. C. Escher’s artwork, drawing upon illusions such as staircases leading to nowhere. Thoughtful choreography (Christine A. Maroti ’14) also lends a profoundly sensual dimension, reflecting the book’s theme of freedom from oppression. “Movement tells a story in a different way than words can,” says Maroti, who uses choreography to underscore the subtle dimensions that are suggested but unspoken in the script.
With an untold twist at the end where characters have to make a decision regarding Dracula, this adaptation throws in the surprise and excitement characteristic of the supernatural unknown and hopes to create a classy portrayal of one legendary and notorious figure, Count Dracula.

The gateway is a fickle symbol. Some gateways banish; others welcome. Sparkling opportunities and debilitating addictions alike have been labeled as gateways. To Bengali author Amitav Ghosh in his latest book, “gateways are not merely entrances and exits–they are tunnels between different dimensions of existence.” The second novel of his Ibis trilogy, “River of Smoke,” wanders through the gateways between various dimensions of cosmopolitan existence around the Pearl River during the years leading up to the Opium Wars of the early nineteenth century.
The novel is told mainly from the perspectives of four outsiders who have come, by design or happenstance, to the foreign enclave or “Fanqui-town” outside Canton, a city that simultaneously relies on international trade and denies all foreigners the right to enter. Its narrative, therefore, ranges over broad swaths of expatriate experience. One of its protagonists is an Indian opium trader, Bahram. Another is his loyal secretary, or munshi, Neel. The third is a French orphan named Paulette with a botanical bent who finds a mentor in an accomplished English gardener and horticultural tourist named Fincher. The last is a painter and Paulette’s childhood friend, Robin Chinnery, who has roamed far from home to find a real friend. With such a diverse cast of characters at its disposal, “River of Smoke” paints a historically sophisticated and obsessively detailed picture of cultural synthesis. Ghosh infuses each of their tales with terrific taxonomies of local tastes and pidgin tongues.
Yet the real heart of the story lies with the illegal opium trade, a practice that has just begun to cause friction between foreign traders and the Chinese government when the novel opens in 1838. Yet in his attempt to comment on the political altercations surrounding the trade, Ghosh neglects to endow his own language and characters with the same depth he gives to their meals and dialects. “River of Smoke” emerges as an ambitious yet shallow page-turner, a work that moralizes more than it moves.
There is an undeniable brilliance in those moments when Ghosh loses himself in descriptions of local flavors. “It had taken two days to prepare,” he writes of one delicacy served to Bahram, “and included some thirty condiments – crisp shoots of bamboo and slippery sea-cucumbers; chewy tendons of pork and juicy sea scallops; taro root and abalone; fish-lips and mushrooms – a symphony of carefully harmonized contrasts of texture and taste, it was reputed to have lured many a monk into breaking his vows.” Nor is Ghosh’s descriptive energy spent purely on the gastronomic arts; Fincher’s horticultural holy grail, the Golden Camellia, is treated with equal care.
Perhaps most impressive, though, is the way Ghosh represents the various voices of the inhabitants of the Fanqui-town. “‘Long time see no woman. No chance do jaahk,’” says one of Bahram’s sons in an English-Cantonese pidgin. “‘Ee’d have a bosun’s pay, and nothing charged for the victuals neither,’” offers Fincher to Paulette. A linguistic adventure in its own right, the novel demands readers rest content with a vague pseudo-understanding of its dialogue. This clever device inspires empathy with those foreigners removed far from their own linguistic origins.
But despite the variegated beauty of such descriptions and dialects, Ghosh stumbles when it comes to dramatic subtlety. Large passages of text seem to serve no purpose beyond heavy-handed exposition. The logical flow of the dialogue suffers a similar weakness, with conversations frequently beginning with the telling “As you know.” The author litters his prose with ad hoc explanations and details, rather than building a strong dramatic framework that would build expectation. The result is a somewhat unengaging narrative.
It may well be said, however, that the historical events themselves are not worthy of much more than Ghosh offers. Though the action of the novel centers around the opium trade, he only refers vaguely to the life-threatening and corrupting influences of the drug itself. For a novel entitled “River of Smoke,” experiential descriptions of the effects of opium are strangely few and far between. The two or three that Ghosh does include are limp instances of narcotic tourism embarked upon by Bahram. Instead of motivating his discussion of the run-up to the Opium Wars by engaging with personal narratives of the drug, Ghosh rather oddly chooses to focus on the bureaucratic bickering of the day. The protracted exchange of prohibitory edicts and vague statements of compliance statements between newly instated Chinese Commissioner Lin Zexu and the foreign businessmen involved in the opium trade is, frankly, just as dry as it sounds.
Of course, the politics of the debate are in fact intricate and intriguing; in another context, the issues of economic freedom and commercial colonialism could provide excellent fodder for fiction. Yet Ghosh never seizes the opportunity to explore these topics in depth. His rendering of the dialectic is condescendingly reductive; he twists the main players into good guys and bad guys, martyrs and traitors. The trader Charles King, who refuses to participate in the opium trade, is held up as a paradigm of commercial conscience misunderstood by his contemporaries. The new Commissioner is upstanding, uncorruptible, and magnanimous even to the foreigners that defile his land with their ruinous goods. Those who object to his policies against the opium trade might invoke principles of free trade in their own favor, but their truly mercenary motives are thinly veiled
Ghosh’s ambition to craft a sweeping, detailed portrait of the cosmopolitan Fanqui-town backfires at the expense of his characters. By lavishing attention on many characters at once, he hardly has time—even over an indulgent 500 pages—to develop any of them properly. Each has just a couple of defining traits, and that’s it. Bahram is illicitly successful but mildly conscientious; Neel is a curious polyglot; Paulette is eager and horticulturally gifted; and Robin is talented and of uncertain sexual orientation.
On a few tantalizing occasions, Ghosh offers glimpses of true insight. The novel boasts some genuinely funny moments, as when Ghosh pokes fun at superstition and puns about translation. “I too would be quite astonished if a young lady of tender years were to felicitate me on my dexterity in ‘polishing the ‘foc-stick,’’” Robin writes to Paulette, who is still growing accustomed to speaking in English. Other teases come in the form of melancholy, poignant reflections. Of the garishly decorated flower boats floating on the Pearl River, Ghosh writes, “in the bright light of day they looked … rather tired and melancholy, more tawdry than gaudy, humbled by the sun and ready to accept defeat in their unwinnable war against mundanity.” Such moments are frustratingly rare in a book filled to the brim with sexy yet shallow sketches of 19th-century cosmopolitanism.

Like most popular musicians, Tom Waits is completely and totally insane. But while most pop stars confine their craziness to the tabloid pages, Waits gladly lets it spill into his sonic output by populating his bizarre musical backdrops with a variety of oddball characters and stories. This is a strange formula, but it’s consistently worked due to the strength of Waits’s performances, which allow even the weirdest songs to project a certain integrity. For more than thirty years, Waits has been so good that his audience is forced to take his nuttiness seriously. So when he fumbles on his new album, “Bad As Me,” it doesn’t just mean the vocals are a little off or the music’s a little boring; it means that the whole thing falls apart.
The record is messy, incoherent, and impossible to take seriously. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the title track, which melds a so-so lyric—something about Christianity and bras—with one of Waits’s least interesting vocal performances to date. Waits has relied on his raspy, one-of-a-kind voice to deliver the most seemingly ridiculous lyrics, and has always been capable of imbuing even the most surreal lines about donuts with a strange power, as on 1985’s “9th and Hennepin.” On the song “Bad As Me,” he sounds as if he’s struggling to make himself heard. There is no menace or danger in his performance; he just sounds embarrassingly overexcited, and that lapse in his delivery takes away any power the song might have had.
Similar difficulties emerge with the album’s quieter songs. “Pay Me,” for instance, features a delicate acoustic arrangement and a typically decicated vocal from Waits. Instead of contrasting in an interesting way, however, the two elements are simply at odds with each other. The uncertain, almost amateurish sound of Waits’s performance makes him seem unsure of himself, almost as if he had wandered into the wrong studio and was singing over an unfamiliar backing track.
Though Waits’s subpar vocals are the worst feature of “Bad As Me,” the instrumentals aren’t much better. The album’s lackluster, uninteresting soundscapes seem like a pale imitation of Waits’s 1980s heyday, mainly thanks to his pandering use of sampled beats and drum machines. Tellingly, the best songs on the record—the ballads “New Year’s Eve” and “Back in the Crowd”—don’t feature any digital instrumentation.
Though artists can certainly benefit by embracing new technologies, for Waits it’s a misguided move because his best work has a distinctly organic and romantically old-fashioned quality to it. His signature ramshackle beats are slightly off-kilter and fascinatingly unsteady. When that natural percussion is replaced by a coldly mechanical beat, Waits’s music loses much of its charm. Opener “Chicago,” for instance, features an overly repetitive sampled beat that only emphasizes the fact that the song doesn’t go anywhere; it’s simply content to grind along for a few minutes, and then end.
Needless to say, this quickly becomes tiring. And the choice to use sampled beats is disturbing for another reason, as it implies that Waits has gotten lazy. According to a 1985 interview published in British newspaper The Mail, Waits eschewed digital instrumentation during his heyday. Instead, he chose to make weird sounds by doing weird things like hitting a chest of drawers with a two by four. This probably didn’t add anything sonically to his records—noise is noise, after all—but it showed the devotion that Waits had to his music and the lengths to which he would go to get a specific sound. The decision to use generic digital beats on “Bad As Me” may signal the waning of that creative drive.
Despite all this, “Bad As Me” retains a certain respectability; even if Waits has gotten lazy and his vocals aren’t up to snuff, the sound of the record is still fairly unique. There’s still no one else making music like this;Waits, as always, is an original. The fact that he retains that status at the age of 61 is impressive. All the same, it’d be more impressive if “Bad As Me” was listenable as well as distinctive.

Axel Willner could not have picked a more apt title for this record. An up-and-coming Swedish artist, he won universal acclaim on his first album “From Here We Go Sublime.” He is a master at producing densely layered music, forming intricate melodic patterns, and creating complex rhythms with an impressive variety of music samples. His newest album, “Looping State of Mind,” once again demonstrates his keen ability to compile seemingly unrelated bits of music into a mind-warping, dreamy masterpiece.
“Looping State of Mind” can only be described through contradictions. It is at once minimalist and complex. All of the songs are built on a basic 4/4 meter, and at any given point, the most prominent melody is only composed of two or three notes. “Burned Out,” for example, combines a simple melody of three tones with a slowly developing rhythm that carries the song beautifully through a steady evolution. Despite the repetition, the songs are dynamic and the beats are complex. Due to Willner’s impeccable musical control, the instrumental parts continue to change. They form an extraordinary repertoire of timbres in every song, made only more distinct through their juxtaposition with such consistent repetition. With every loop, a new layer of music is introduced; by the very end of the segment, the music is a compilation of many individual and self-sustaining yet gloriously interlocking components.
Though the loops are crafted through heavy production and extensive use of electronic instruments, the album defies strict classification. “Looping State of Mind” certainly has characteristics of house music in its focus primarily on the bass and the beat, yet the album is not particularly danceable because its multiple layers contribute to an echoic effect—especially prominent in the midsection of “Then It’s White.” This ambient aspect makes it closer to experimental than to dance music. All the same, compared to ambient artists such as The American Dollar, The Field is distinctly more catchy thanks to its emphasis on the drum samples and its rhythmic creativity.
Perhaps the most beautiful part of The Field’s music is its understanding of the power of musical context. Each track begins with disconnected bits and that are subtly pulled into coherence through the inclusion of counterpoints. “Is This Power,” for example, begins with two notes and an off-kilter drum part, with disconcerting imbalance. Half a minute in, however, the music suddenly shifts into focus. The subtle introduction of another percussion part ties the song together. After a minute, the music is fully developed, complete with a ghostly bass melody. Toward the end, even when the music seems fully developed, it undergoes a marked tonal shift with the introduction of a guitar, and the entire cycle of development begins anew.
However, the album has its faults. While the repetitiveness of the songs often produces a strong sense movement, the overuse of this developmental structure becomes tired. Additionally, the profusion of short melodic phrases easily leads to disinterest. The titular track may be considered the weakest of the album due to its excessive repetition, little of which justifies its hefty 10 and a half–minute length. Finale “Sweet Slow Baby,” is likewise a disappointment. While it succeeds in integrating atmospheric, unintelligible voices to reach an almost disembodied, euphoric effect, it seems to promise a climax that never comes—the track builds up to a very heavy, noisy height and ends without resolution.
While the album creatively manipulates its drum beats and exhibits well-developed layers, its lack of melodies and the excessive use of repetitions, skilfully rendered as they are, prevent it from becoming truly engaging. “Looping State of Mind” provides beautiful background music but doesn’t carry enough distinguishing factors to command a listener’s entire consideration. Ultimately, the album does enough to satiate a music lover’s appetite for harmony and strongly controlled development, but leaves the mind craving more than just loops.

“Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,” the first single from Coldplay’s fifth album, is certainly an earworm. Unfortunately for Coldplay’s target audience—that is, human beings and some higher primates—“Teardrop,” unlike 2008’s “Viva la Vida,” is less like a benign earworm, and more like an earwig, or ringworm.
For better or worse, the first single is a fair indication of Coldplay’s new direction. The lyrics mean less than ever before, the synths mean more, and the melodies mean everything. But it’s Martin’s melodies that have always been the reason to listen to Coldplay; and the melodies of “Mylo Xyloto” are as big as ever.
Standout track “Charlie Brown” probably says even more than the first single does about what this album gets right, and what it gets wrong. Whereas the rest of Coldplay seems to have forgotten they once had aspirations of being a proper rock band—evidently drummer Will Champion was pawned for a drum machine halfway through the “Mylo Xyloto” sessions—at some point guitarist Jonny Buckland convinced himself that he, at least, was an honest-to-god rock star. Between the ringing wide-eyed guitar line propelling “Charlie Brown” and the distorted riff driving “Major Minus,” he makes it hard to disagree.
Buckland has quietly—well, as quietly as anyone in Coldplay does anything—developed one of the most irresistibly joyful sounds in popular music. It’s the perfect companion to Martin’s own restless ebullience, and it makes “Mylo Xyloto” what it is: a bundle of compressed, over-synthesized joy, and a surprisingly apt fit for the neon graffiti of the album’s cover. The band that began all yellow has become one of the most colorful acts in music.
Buckland makes it easy to forget that there was a time when Coldplay relied on Martin’s soft pop piano, his trademark falsetto, and a sometimes offensive excess of melodramatic conviction. But the odd thing about his emergence—and about the song “Charlie Brown” in particular—is that sometimes the surfeit of blissful melodies feels more like a cheap sugar rush than a real rush of blood to the head. It gives the impression that Coldplay’s writing process now involves coming up with an excess of good to great melodies that bear some relation to each other, insisting that each is, of course, equally world-beating, and then stringing the parts together with more enthusiasm than discrimination.
The album as a whole, though, hangs well together. The grating singles sound much better with quieter tracks sandwiching them. Between “U.F.O.”—a brief interlude that recalls the spare prettiness of “Parachutes”—and delicate ballad “Up in Flames,” even glitzy Rihanna-feature “Princess of China” becomes bearable.
As it turns out, “Mylo Xyloto,” like “Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,” means the same thing “Viva la Vida” means, the same thing Coldplay has meant since it took its first band name, “Starfish.” It means laughably absurd assertions about laughably, absurdly beautiful things. It means nothing too specific, nothing possibly offensive.
With “Mylo Xyloto” Coldplay proves itself to be the most daringly spineless band on the planet. They want nothing more or less than universal adoration, but they’ve yet to settle for recycling the same sounds that have won them adoration in the past. From the jolting start of speedball second track, “Hurts Like Heaven.” to the quiet end of the restrained, multifaceted album closer, “Up With the Birds,” “Mylo Xyloto” sounds like the efforts of a band hellbent on refusing to stagnate.
Finding something rebellious about one of the most domestic bands in rock was the trick of “Viva la Vida,” with its allusions to the French Revolution and the band’s playfully militaristic costumes: it cast simple joy as rebellion. It’s a thin line between leading a popular rebellion and struggling to be popular, but the grandiose sounds and concept-album aspirations of “Mylo Xyloto” make it hard to doubt Coldplay’s earnestness. Rihanna’s not on the album to sell records; she’s on the album because Chris Martin thinks Rihanna is brilliant. And, for what began as an indie rock band, there’s something rebellious about that.
Five albums in, it turns out first single “Yellow” told us all we needed to know about Coldplay: whom do they write songs for? You. What’s love like? The stars. And even if they haven’t quite restrained themselves to coloring inside the lines yet, Coldplay’s addition of a few more bright colors in their crayon box still feels like a victory for pop music.

Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA), an L.A.-based hip-hop collective, is a group that ignites debate whenever they are brought up. Many criticize their graphic descriptions of rape and murder, while others think they are revolutionizing the world of hip-hop. The group has enjoyed a meteoric rise to popularity, as well as a deluge of critical accolades. It can be hard to form an opinion on a collective that is so new and so often talked about, due in part to their prolific pre-frame release, and in part to the effort it takes to ignore the fierce debate surrounding their work.
However, on the evening of October 21, the leader of the group, Tyler, the Creator, gave the sold-out crowd in the Royale in Boston no time to think about whether or not they approved of Odd Future. After the group’s DJ and only female member Syd tha Kid entertained the crowd with a set for about 20 minutes, the show really began with Tyler sprinting from offstage and diving straight into the audience without any warning or introduction. The fans, who had spent the past hour eagerly waiting and chanting “Wolf Gang” over and over again, exploded into a frenzy as they fought to support Tyler—both literally and figuratively—in his crowdsurfing endeavor.
Tyler’s headfirst introduction was an explosion of energy that never really diminished for the entirety of the 90-minute performance. The crowd never needed any encouragement; they started shoving and jumping with all the intensity of an angry mob as soon as Tyler took the stage, but instead of anger it was pure energy that seemed to surge through the audience. It is difficult to overemphasize the ferocity with which people struggled to get even an inch or two closer to the stage, and the frequency with which people crowdsurfed forwards on the hands and heads of the crowd.
The frenetic energy of the audience was matched by the aggression and force of the performance. Hodgy Beats and Left Brain, two other members of Odd Future who also comprise a duo known as MellowHype, took to the stage to trade verses with Tyler. Domo Genesis rapped on the song “Rolling Papers” alongside Tyler. Yet despite the other performers’ remarkable talent, Tyler was without question the center of the show. While he was rapping, it was as if he emanated an uncontainable energy and all hands were either in the air or being used for moshing. While the other members performed admirably by normal standards, they never exhibited the same commanding presence as Tyler. This was unfortunate for the other members of Odd Future, as Tyler, the Creator is so full of kinetic energy and charisma that he often incidentally relegates the other members to the background.
Even outside of the collective’s wild performance, the show would have been animated to the point of being slightly terrifying, as audience members’ glasses and shoes were knocked off and everyone had to fight to simply stay on two feet. People snuck up the side of the stage, only to get a running start to dive off. Throughout the night, the crowd shouted along with the members of Odd Future and chanted their names in awe. The energy peaked during the group’s better-known singles, which incidentally are principally Tyler, the Creator songs. People jumped up in the air and on top of each other during “French!” During the song “Radicals” the crowd passionately shouted, “Kill people, burn shit, fuck school,” as they struck out and shoved each other violently.
The ending of the show felt like the end of a battle. Everyone was drenched in sweat, sore, and tired, but unlike in war, everyone was grinning ear to ear. People limped away from the club, but they laughed and sang out their favorite lines from Odd Future songs as they did.

The opening paragraphs of Ha Jin’s latest novel, “Nanjing Requiem,” are as relentlessly brutal as the event they describe. With little fanfare Ban, a scrawny teenage messenger, recounts his experience as a Chinese captive of the Japanese Imperial Army, relating an onslaught of gruesome images: “Along the way every pond and every creek had dead bodies in it, humans and animals, and the water changed color. When we were thirsty, we had no choice but to drink the foul water.” Ban’s meager rice rations have a red tinge, leaving him with the taste of blood in his mouth for hours. At the end of Ban’s harrowing story, Jin’s narrator Anling merely adds, “I jotted down what he said.” Anling’s response may seem callous to contemporary readers, but Jin’s intent is not to create a historical account of the victims of the Nanjing massacre. “Nanjing Requiem” is instead an ode to an individual who fought against the atrocities, the American missionary Minnie Vautrin. Though Jin’s portrayal of Vautrin is less dynamic than one might expect from a National Book Award-winning novelist, he is nevertheless able to present a spare, compelling perspective on the calamitous events around her.
Vautrin—or Minnie, as she is called in the novel––was one of few foreigners who stayed in Nanjing during the Nanjing Massacre, a six-week-long period of genocide and mass rape at the hands of the Japanese Imperial Army, beginning in December 1937. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed Chinese soldiers were murdered, and it is estimated that 80,000 Chinese women were raped. Vautrin stayed as the dean of Jinling Women’s College, opening the campus to nearly 10,000 refugees. With little else but courage and a small American flag, Vautrin saved lives by confronting Japanese soldiers who entered the campus. Yet despite her efforts, the makeshift refugee camp was far from immune to the terrors of the massacre. Over the course of Jin’s novel, Japanese soldiers abduct civilian men and women from the camp and rape even occurs within its confines.
Jin’s stark prose is apt for these events; a more vivid lens would render the novel’s events even more unbearable. On more than one occasion, Minnie interrupts brutal rapes at the campus. “Startled,” Anling recounts, “the man pulled out his hand and rose to his feet, still smiling with his lips quivering. The woman, moaning in agony, closed her eyes and turned her head to the wall, a small birthmark below her right ear. Her body reminded me of a large piece of meat for cutting, except for the spasms that jolted her every two or three seconds.” The unrepentant soldier is able to leave the situation unscathed while his mutilated victim writhes on the floor. Minnie demands that this officer be punished for his actions and the superior officer’s reply is nearly as abhorrent as the rape itself. The officer grins, telling Minnie that the rapist is nicknamed “the Obstetrician.” Occasionally, though, Jin’s blunted language is less effective than in this harrowing passage. A technique that is necessary and powerful when describing atrocities does not export well to the dialogue. Because of this, the authenticity of the novel fluctuates, but overall this is a minor complaint and Jin’s style is mostly appropriate.
Minnie’s actions are filtered through the perspective of her fictional assistant, Anling, who narrates the novel with a stoic air. Her plainspoken observations are one of the few reasonable moments in an environment dominated by an unfathomable degree of violence. On one occasion, she notes that most of the Chinese recruits seem to be weak, illiterate teenagers from the countryside, “sent to the front as nothing but gun fodder.” Jin’s narrator with an “iron mouth and a tofu heart” is more than a convenient plot device and a recorder for Vautrin’s experiences. When Anling’s calm exterior finally breaks, the effect is startling, and her responses serve as a litmus test of the situation’s stress.
However, Jin’s portrayal of Vautrin is more reverential than multifaceted. Minnie works tirelessly to care for the refugees, who christen her “The Goddess of Mercy.” Though Anling is an effective narrator in many respects, Jin’s portrayal of Vautrin reveals little depth or introspection. Obscured by a veneer of moral certainty, Vautrin is portrayed just like her moniker suggests: as a goddess and a paragon of morality. Vautrin killed herself after surviving one of the worst genocides in history, haunted by her experiences and her guilt over not saving more lives. Yet Jin’s exploration of her trauma is a peripheral one, leaving her profoundly uncompelling as a character.
Despite the shortcomings of characterization, Jin engages with the political context of the massacre tastefully, imbuing the novel with subtle nods to the massacre’s legacy. An article casting the Japanese soldiers in a heroic light appalls the characters and alludes to decades of Japanese revisionist history of the event—some historians even claim the massacre did not occur. Jin does not explain the events, but instead allows the characters to discern their meaning for themselves, and when they do so, they are devastated by the injustice.  For example, Jin does not simply state that General Chiang Kai-Shek is leaving Nanjing to its fate. Instead, Angling learns this when she sees Chiang’s wife’s donations arrive at the refugee camp: a piano and Victrola. Anling then realizes that he believes the Japanese invasion of Nanjing is unstoppable. The absurdity of the Chiangs’ frivolous donation is one of many ingredients that contributes to the novel’s sense of futility and hopelessness.
Indeed, the most significant contribution of “Nanjing Requiem” to the wealth of literature on the massacre is Jin’s elegant rendering of the event’s violence. Jin conveys how the events are not only fearful but also absurd, adding an extra layer of meaning to the characters’ suffering. Even though we are rarely granted access to Minnie’s internal thoughts, the immersive depiction of Nanjing’s horrors ensures that we can understand the cause of her psychological disintegration after the massacre. Despite the weaknesses in her portrayal, Minnie’s ability to function courageously in the Nanjing of Jin’s making gives this requiem its desired resonance.

Harvard is currently reviewing its policies toward sexual assault in an effort to comply with federal discrimination regulations. Furthermore, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response announced that it had formed a committee to review its policies.
Harvard must actively use this opportunity to comprehensively improve the way that cases of sexual assault on campus are currently handled. At the University, there is a significant lack of visibility toward the sexual assault proceedings—a gap in information that limits student understanding of the way in which cases are handled. Sexual assault is a topic that involves a great degree of emotional and legal repercussion, and accordingly, the University should do a better job of informing students of how one should go about reporting such instances.
To use a parallel example: During opening exercises as a freshman and even at the beginning of subsequent years, Harvard undergraduates are inundated with information regarding alcohol policies and the way to handle alcohol-related incidents. However, the dearth of information surrounding topics such as preventing sexual assault, reporting possible cases of sexual harassment, and helping fellow students in such traumatizing situations promotes an unhealthy and unsafe college environment. The University has relied too heavily on Sex Signals as the be-all end-all approach to informing the campus about the topic, and even this event is highly imperfect, because it is not approached by freshmen in a serious and thoughtful manner. The fact that sexual assault seems to go largely underreported is not puzzling considering the profound lack of campus-wide education on the sensitive topic.
Harvard makes it a point to force students to complete tasks such as Alcohol Edu; however, students are largely uninformed of the policies in place to seek recourse in the event of sexual assault. Questions that are popularly unanswered include: Who do I go to in order to report an instance of sexual assault? Does an accusation of sexual assault or harassment result in being ad boarded? Who can I turn to in order to get support? The veracity toward which Harvard treats alcohol-related incidents must ultimately parallel the University's commitment to informing all students about the way that sexual assault is treated.
Additionally, many organizations at Harvard must be revamped to deal with the issue in order to facilitate an effective solution to the problem. Firstly, University Health Services must be better equipped to deal with the problem of sexual assault. At times, alcohol poisoning tends to be the first response and first concern when victims of sexual assault are brought to the facility. Secondly, there must be more support for and coordination amongst counseling groups such as OSAPR, Room 13, and the Sexual Assault Sexual Harassment tutors.
In addition to the University taking steps to revamp sexual assault policies, we as students must also make a commitment to fostering a safe environment. Students must take an active role in providing assistance to those in times of trauma and help those who they feel have not consented to sexual advances. We should strive for a campus culture that promotes healthy relationships, wherein individuals feel safe to report instances wherein they feel that their rights have been violated.
Lastly, the definition of sexual assault on campus must be re-conceived in order to support the potential victim of such crimes. Sexual violence must be defined as that occurring in the absence of spoken or verbal consent—not that which happens when an individual expresses negative unwillingness. This change must be made in order to protect those who become victims of sexual assault in cases involving alcohol or other drugs. Ultimately, the University must take proactive measures to ensure that students feel safe coming forward and reporting suspected sexual assault and that the individuals providing advice are well-trained.

It’s time to face reality: marriage is dying. Divorce rates remain high, fewer couples than ever are choosing to get married, and more are choosing to cohabitate. However, far from liberating adults from old social mores, this shift creates unstable and unhealthy environments for children and adults alike. One does not have to look far to see the threats posed by marriage’s decline.
Marriage affects people on many levels: socially, psychologically, emotionally, and financially, among others. The Institute for American Values recognizes it as a “virtually universal human institution”. Across cultures, one of the most vital elements in marriage is commitment to family. Just as husbands and wives commit themselves totally to each other, they also commit themselves to raising their children together. This responsibility to children is a moral duty that parents must take seriously; generally speaking, in order to thrive and develop properly, a child must see his home as a stable and loving environment, rooted in the relationship between his mother and father. This is best achieved when the mother and father are married, since only marriage represents a complete and lasting commitment to the family.
Today a third of all children live without two married parents at home, depriving them of the benefits of a marriage-based home. Research shows that on average, children who live with their own, married parents are physically healthier and even live longer. Children whose parents divorce show higher rates of psychological distress and mental illness, such as depression. They are also more likely to experience poverty, to be held back a grade, drop out of high school, become unemployed, and have lower occupational status and earnings.
By contrast, children raised in traditional households perform better on a myriad of sociological indices, such as educational achievement, emotional health, familial and sexual development, and child and adult behavior, including rates of delinquency and incarceration. They are also less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. As the research institution Child Trends reported, “family structure matters for children, and the family structure that helps children the most is a family headed by two biological parents in a low‐conflict marriage.” Thus, the data exposes the vulnerability of children in the changing landscape of marriage.
Marriage not only serves the needs of children—it is also the best option for couples themselves. In its report “Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles,” the Witherspoon Institute found that, compared to people in other relationships, married couples earn more, are physically healthier, and experience much less domestic violence and infidelity. Furthermore, the institute added, “[C]ohabiting couples who go on to marry also face a higher risk of divorce, compared to couples who marry without cohabiting.” The social science is clear: Marriage provides better conditions than any other form of relationship for couples’ well being.
Where does this advantage come from? The answer lies in norms fundamental to the nature of marriage. Ideally, marriage is characterized by permanence and fidelity, which foster a uniquely strong and enduring relationship. Marriage is not merely a union of hearts and minds, nor is it only a romantic or sexual partnership. It is a comprehensive union that unites a husband and wife across all dimensions of the person.
These norms mean that marriage fosters a distinctive stability and provides an extraordinary opportunity for the flourishing of those who enter into it, both as individuals and as a unit. In marriage, a husband and wife share all the challenges and joys of life—especially the burdens and blessings of raising a family—making the former less trying and latter more bountiful. Compare that to schizophrenic lifestyles of casual sex, open relationships, cohabitation, etc., all of which lack the uniting value that makes marriage so fulfilling. These types of relationships are poor imitations of marriage, aiming for fulfillment but flying wildly off the mark.
Marriage is not an anachronism that society has simply outgrown, but it is in danger of becoming a relic of a bygone era. It is the basis for strong, healthy families and the fabric of any strong community. Thus, let us preserve a culture of marriage for ourselves and for future generations. Failure to do so would come at a devastating price.

Like the Tea Party, the Occupy Wall Street movement began out of a growing sense of frustration with the way society seems to operate. And this is where similarities between the movements end. The Tea Party had clear goals: lower taxes, shrink inefficient and burdensome portions of government, and allow individuals and private entrepreneurs to flourish. The Occupy movement, on the other hand, seems to be united against the “greed” of the one percent for the ironic reason that they want more. The protestors have a right to be frustrated with the current system, but their demands reveal a profound disrespect for freedom and ignorance of the real culprits in America’s “rigged” system.
Last week, pollster for former President Clinton, Douglas E. Schoen, published the results of the first poll of the movement. After interviewing hundreds of protestors, his firm found that, “what binds a large majority of the protestors together . . . is a deep commitment to left-wing policies: opposition to free-market capitalism and support for radical redistribution of wealth, intense regulation of the private sector, and protectionist policies.” Given their obsession with the belief in representing the 99 percent, their agenda appears to be nothing less the dissolving of income inequality in the United States, Yet the protestors have identified no way to accomplish this by increasing the wealth of the 99 percent. To the contrary, in lockstep with Obama, the movement supports forcing the one percent to become part of the 99 percent instead of the other way around.
Americans used to deny people rights unjustly based on race, religion, and sex. Today, the Occupy Wall Street Movement with the support of Democratic leaders seeks to trample on income minorities. Their claim is that what’s yours should not be yours because it should be mine. An endorsement of the OWS movement in The Nation, the self-proclaimed “flagship of the left,” stated, among other things, that “private ownership corrupts democracy” and governments should “focus on public goods . . . rather than on private liberty and personal property.” Clearly, then, the Occupy Wall Street movement and its Democratic supporters have shifted the progressive movement radically to the left, placing  the organization of the state above the free decisions of its citizens. They scream for the equality of wealth and then do everything possible to shred equality of liberty. It fulfills what de Tocqueville predicted more than a century earlier, “Democracy extends the sphere of individual freedom; socialism restricts it. Democracy attaches all possible value to each man; socialism makes each man a mere agent, a mere number.”
To give the movement some credit, the latest crisis displayed clearly that the current system is broken. The problem is that the current system is not based on capitalism and free enterprise but government coercion. To give one example, Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Member Peter J. Wallison noted in his dissent from the report of the majority of the commission, “the sine qua non of the financial crisis was U.S. government housing policy, which led to the creation of 27 million subprime and other risky loans—half of all mortgages in the United States.” Through legislation passed by Congress during the 1990s, the government required Fannie, Freddie and later regulated private banks to reduce mortgage-underwriting standards. The subprime mortgage bubble existed only in the United States not because of universal greed but because of U.S. government policy. Wall Street was far from blameless, but the root cause of the entire collapse was a misguided U.S. policy designed to give the less fortunate homes they couldn’t afford.
We all have the inalienable rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness because we are human; governments do not provide them, but they can prevent us from obtaining them. To forsake liberty for the sake of equality is to give the government unlimited power as the great distributor, and, as Hayek argued in The[MMS1] Road to Serfdom, “in this way a democracy may set up the most complete despotism imaginable.” Conservatives believe in society because they believe in the creative power of millions of individuals that make up this truly exceptional nation. When the government rejects the individual for the so-called expertise of regulators, things fall apart. Agreeing to hate the one percent who pay 38 percent of income taxes accomplishes nothing, and sacrificing liberty will only take the nation to serfdom. If the Occupy movement truly wants to be the source of positive change in the United States, it should join the Tea Party and occupy government. The quickest way to fix the system is to elect a government humble enough to let each individual succeed, or fail, on his own merit.

China-Africa relations today are fraught with stereotypes: That China is a neo-colonialist power, that China is only interested in Africa’s oil, and that China only does business with African despots. Underlying these predominately Western-generated stereotypes, however, is an undeniable truth: Over the past decade, China has been more effective than the West in developing strong relations with African nations.
The success of China’s ventures in Africa is apparent upon visiting any of the 48 African nations that China has diplomatic ties with today. From ubiquitous road construction to major resource extraction, the Chinese influence is palpable across Africa. Employing a practice of combining typical humanitarian aid with business and following a “no strings attached” policy in which the government pledges not to interfere in the domestic affairs of African nations, the Chinese have been extremely proficient in brokering new business deals. This method radically diverges from the standard United States approach to business in Africa, which has historically placed priority on democracy over development. Although China’s policies have drawn strong criticism from Western nations on the grounds of transparency and human-rights issues, they have yielded more tangible economic benefits for both China and its African partners.
The difference in the effectiveness of American and Chinese policy toward Africa has been highlighted in Sudan over months since South Sudan seceded from Sudan. Earlier this year, the U.S. played a key role in assuring South Sudan’s smooth democratic secession from Sudan. In a New York Times op-ed, President Obama asserted U.S. support for South Sudan in the referendum process, writing that “those who make the right choice will by remembered by history—they will also have a steady partner in the United States.” Despite this bold statement of support for the fledgling nation, upon gaining independence, South Sudan and the U.S. have yet to broker any major business deals and the U.S. has largely failed to become otherwise involved in the progress of the new nation as of yet.
On the other hand, ever since the reality of a secession movement began to take root, China has been carefully orchestrating the transition from fully supporting Bashir’s regime in Sudan to balancing its interests between both nations. Knowing that 80 percent of Sudan’s oil is produced in South Sudan, China founded a special consulate in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, even before the nation gained independence. From this pre-meditated position, China’s ambassador to Sudan, Yang Jiechi, launched into a series of talks this summer with Bashir and the new leader of South Sudan, President Kiir, over the future of the three countries’ oil relations. Recognizing the integrated nature of business between the two countries, China accordingly situated itself in the axis of power, facilitating between the two. While China can do business with Khartoum and Juba, the U.S. cannot enter the South Sudan oil market while oil is still running through pipelines owned and controlled by Sudan, which maintains its position on the State Department’s State Sponsors of Terrorism list.
Although China’s “no strings attached” policy naturally puts the U.S. at a disadvantage in South Sudan, the U.S. can still learn from China’s holistic approach to relations with South Sudan and other African nations. China has major investments in Africa’s natural resources, but contrary to common belief, China has also diligently diversified its business interests in Africa outside of the natural resource sector. In his visit to South Sudan this past August, Yang made it clear that China is interested in working in areas outside of oil extraction such as, “agriculture, infrastructure [and] construction." This approach will not only allow China to gain the natural resources it needs for development but also help South Sudan gain a foothold in a broad range of markets by partnering with an economic giant. Although the U.S. is unable to engage in large-scale oil transactions with South Sudan, policymakers should observe China’s foresight and engage in other sectors of the new country’s economy. In doing this, the U.S. would not only support South Sudan’s struggling economy as President Obama outlined but would also maintain a connection to the South Sudanese business world in preparation for the eventual lifting of sanctions on Sudan.
The most important lesson the U.S. can learn from China is the effectiveness of the Chinese focus on development as the priority in doing business in Africa. Although it is important for the U.S. to represent democracy worldwide, China’s emphasis on economic growth may be more beneficial for African nations. In doing this, China avoids playing the paternalistic role the West has often taken in Africa and instead helps African nations build a foundation of prosperity from which good governance and human rights can hopefully follow.
Ultimately, neither country has a flawless record or strategy in Africa, but both the U.S. and China must be aware of the enormous influence they have to shape the future of African nations due to their sheer economic power. Going forward, Sino-American relations will be tested as competition for Africa’s resources increases and the difference in their policies become more apparent. While tensions will naturally arise, as China and the U.S. both stake claims in different sectors of the African economy, the power of African nations to choose their business partners will increase. Through competition between these two economic giants, African nations can only become less dependent on one nation and more prosperous overall.

Local police have alerted the public to one or more suspects carrying out sexual assaults against women following an incident in Somerville.
The Somerville Police Department is investigating an indecent assault and battery that occurred late last Thursday.
At roughly 11:30 p.m., a 23 year old woman was attacked as she was walking alone from the Porter Square T station to a friend’s house.
The suspect approached her from behind at the corner of Elm and Holyoke road.
She was then pushed into a car and “indecently assaulted,” which police say constitutes an attack with sexual overtones but not rape. After she screamed, the attacker ran away.
Authorities said the victim described the attacker as a white male with a dark complexion, roughly 5-foot-8, and clean-shaven. The victim said the attacker was wearing jeans and a black hoodie.
Police have released a sketch of the subject.
On Monday afternoon, the Harvard University Police Department issued a community advisory to alert young women to the assault, urging them to take caution when walking alone at night.
According to Somerville police, this is the latest in a string of similar incidents near MBTA stops in Cambridge and Somerville over the past few weeks. Although there are similarities between the assaults, police have not yet said the attacks were committed by the same person.
Early on Saturday morning, another attack occurred near Tufts University in Medford when a female student was sexually assaulted near campus.
Her attacker also fled when she struggled.
Somerville Police are joining with Transit Police, local police, and police from Harvard and Tufts in Cambridge and Somerville in an effort to identify and apprehend the suspect or suspects.
Representatives from the police departments met today to compare investigative notes and identify possible suspects.

The Harvard Art Museums announced a gift of 38 pieces of artwork on Monday, bestowed by David Barrett ’71 and wife Didi to supplement the University’s existing contemporary American art collection.
The sculpture, drawings, and paintings represent the work of 24 self-taught or “outsider” artists—individuals who had little to no professional training or experienced physical or psychological isolation from society—marking the first time this genre has been included in the University’s museum collection.
The gift includes pieces by notable artists such as Joseph Yoakum, Nellie Mae Rowe, and Bill Traylor. In addition to primarily contemporary works, the collection also includes three rare “ledger book drawings” crafted by members of the Plain Indian tribes in the nineteenth century.
“The objects in the Barrett collection are inspirational and come at a pivotal time when our faculty and students have been asking for works of this genre,” said Theodore E. Stebbins Jr., consultative curator of American art at the Harvard Art Museum, in a press release.
David, who described art and art collection as interests that he shares with his wife, emphasized the typically understated importance of self-taught and “outsider” art.
“We think that [the genre] is very interesting,” he said. “It will hopefully be appealing to young artists and scholars, who will now have the opportunity to study this art in Harvard’s collection.”
According to Director of the Harvard Art Museums Thomas W. Lentz, the gift represents an unprecedented opportunity to supplement the traditional fixtures of the University’s collection—including Asian and Mediterranean art, European and American art, and modern and contemporary art.
“These ‘outsider’ works take our holdings of American contemporary art in an exciting new direction, providing a unique opportunity for study and appreciation by students, scholars, and visitors,” Lentz said in a press release.

“If we have had a successful revolution,” said Shima’a Helmy, “why are all the revolutionaries being arrested and kidnapped?” Helmy, 21, is a human rights activist from Cairo who spoke last night at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at a screening of “Four Women, One Revolution,” a short documentary about the Egyptian Revolution this year.
The event, sponsored by the Harvard Law Documentary Studio, gave the audience of 16 people a chance to hear from and talk to Helmy and journalist Micah Garen, one of the film’s directors.
The film, which follows the stories of four middle-class Egyptian women during the dramatic political upheaval, emphasized that the Egyptian struggle for democracy is far from over. According to Garen and Helmy, the Supreme Council of Armed Forces remains extremely powerful in Egypt and continues to maintain a military dictatorship despite the resignation of former President Hosni Mubarak.
“If you accept that the revolution is over, you’re safe. But if you’re part of the ongoing struggle, you’re a target,” said Helmy, who is one of the four women featured in the film.
The documentary and discussion cited many examples of protesters and bloggers who have been arrested, imprisoned, injured, or killed by forces under the control of the Egyptian military. According to Helmy, SCAF employs “paid thugs” whose primary responsibility is violently dispersing protesters.
According to Garen, one of the most “draconian” and pervasive practices to come out of the Egyptian uprisings has been holding military trials for civilians, which enables the military to dispense “almost any punishment they want to.”
More than 12,000 people have faced military sanctions since the Egyptian Revolution began in earnest last January, and over 9,000 have been convicted—often for crimes like “blogging,” Garen said.
Garen added that those accused of more violent crimes, including Coptic Christian protesters, are often the victims of SCAF-controlled media manipulation and fabrication.
“I never saw a Coptic protester with anything more dangerous than a walking stick,” Garen said.
One notable case that Helmy spoke of was that of Maikel Nabil Sanad, a Coptic blogger who was arrested in his home for writing a sentence that was perceived to be anti-military. He went on a hunger strike to protest his arrest, was then sent to a mental hospital, and has since been denied contact with his family, friends, and various media outlets.
Helmy and Garen expressed concern that Western media attention has waned since Mubarak resigned.
But Helmy and Galen are committed to raising awareness, continuing media coverage, and promoting citizen involvement in the aftermath of the Egyptian Revolution. In particular, they asked viewers to call Congress and demand that the nearly $2 billion the U.S. gives to Egypt in annual foreign aid be restricted so that it cannot be used to fund military trials for civilians.
“A lot of what the army does to control society is through subtle mechanisms of fear,” said Galen, “and the best way to combat that is by speaking out against them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-five years after the founding of the Committee on Women, Gender, and Sexuality, Committee members say the next step for WGS at Harvard is to become a full-fledged department.
WGS is one of many degree-granting committees in the College—along with Social Studies, Folklore and Mythology, and six others. These committees provide courses and degrees just like any other concentration, but draw on faculty members from other departments.
“Departmentalization would give WGS the academic and institutional recognition that the Program deserves,” Director of Undergraduate Studies Caroline Light wrote in an e-mail.
If the ongoing conversation between committee members and Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators does lead to a WGS department, it would mark a significant milestone for WGS as an academic field at Harvard.
Talk of developing a core faculty of its own began three years ago, Light wrote.
Though a FAS budget deficit has inserted an obstacle, Committee members remain hopeful that the recent improvements in the budget will accelerate the process.
“The FAS administration has demonstrated full support for the intellectual and pedagogical reasons for departmentalization,” Light wrote. “We remain hopeful that it will be possible in the near future as the University’s fiscal health improves.”
FINDING ITS PLACE
The effort to become a department comes on the heels of a decade of expansion for the WGS program at Harvard, according to Department Chair Afsaneh Najmabadi.
“We’ve consolidated our faculty, our faculty has grown, we’ve managed to hire more lecturers, the courses we give have become larger, and the number of students taking WGS courses has grown,” she said.
Two years ago, the committee began offering a secondary graduate degree. And next academic year, WGS will begin bringing in one visiting professor each year to fill a newly-created endowed chair in LGBT studies.
The total number of undergraduates enrolled in WGS classes has increased from 388 in the 2008-2009 academic year to 545 during the last academic year.
Najmabadi credits this rise to the increased popularity of WGS in the General Education curriculum.
Courses such as Culture and Belief 37: “The Romance: From Jane Austen to Chick Lit,” and United States and the World 26: “Sex and the Citizen” have also been ranked highly among students in the Q guide ratings.
The number of undergraduate concentrators in the program, however, has seen only gradual growth since 2008. The number of primary concentrators has risen from 16 to 18, the number of joint concentrators has risen from 5 to 9, and the number of students pursuing a secondary in WGS has risen from 9 to 12.
PART OF THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY
Harvard would be among the first of its peers to host a department in WGS.
Within the Ivy League, only Brown has a department devoted to the field. Other Ivies, as well as most smaller liberal arts schools like Williams and Amherst, offer degree programs similar to Harvard’s that borrow faculty from other departments.
But, pointing to the growing popularity of WGS in the GenEd curriculum, Light wrote that WGS stands on the same level within academia as any other field.
“WGS is not a marginalized field, nor is it on the margins of FAS or academic discourse more generally,” she wrote. “Even the most established fields are continually developing and adapting to the changing needs of our community.”
But in addition to navigating through red tape to become a formal department, some students say WGS still faces challenges in gaining respect within the rest of the academic community for its unique form of scholarship.
“I think that because WGS is so rigorous, and it is about questioning the grand narrative of academia—about trying to insert this new voice—people sometimes see it as unnecessary or superfluous,” said Samantha A. Meier ’12. “Sometimes it can be frustrating to realize that there’s only a small segment of the academic world that wants to do that kind of scholarship.”
Ja-Yoon Choe ’12, a WGS concentrator, said that perceptions of the field vary.
“It really depends on how seriously someone takes the material,” Choe said. “WGS definitely challenges a lot of traditional academic fields and really tries to push against common ways of doing things.”

The Digital Public Library of America, an initiative spearheaded by Harvard faculty members, is making fast progress toward developing a fully operational online database of existing digitized works by April 2013.
An international leader in the effort to organize digital copies of printed volumes, represents of the DPLA traveled to Washington, D.C. last week, where they accepted another significant donation from two separate foundations and established relationships with other organizations sharing a common mission.
To support DPLA’s transitional operations, the Sloan Foundation and the Arcadia Fund each donated $2.5 million to the project.
The combined $5 million will cover costs as DPLA attempts to bring together already digitized works that are not yet aggregated in one location.
Leaders of the initiative—including University Professor Robert C. Darnton ’60 and Harvard Law School Professor John G. Palfrey, Jr. ’94—also announced on Friday in Washington a new partnership that will expand the scope of the project.
In addition to long-standing partnerships with the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institute, DPLA will also collaborate with the Europeana Foundation, which works to compile digitized works in Europe.
“The Friday launch showed that things had come together, that we had gathered momentum and were moving fast,” Darnton said yesterday.
“I believe the DPLA is unstoppable,” he said.
Europeana leaders said that the collaboration will promote a framework for global digital archiving.
The two organizations will share a compatible technology infrastructure that encourages cooperation.
“Europeana was designed to be open and interoperable, and to be able to collaborate with the DPLA is a validation of that aim,” Executive Director of Europeana Jill Cousins said in a press release.
“By this combined effort on two continents, Europeana and the DPLA hope to promote the creation of a global network with partners from around the world.”
The DPLA is a little over one year old, according to Darnton, with the first discussions for the project beginning on Oct. 1, 2010.
From that initial discussion, Darnton said that leaders in the field of librarianship have been engaged in realizing the dream of a digital library.
“I invited about forty leaders of foundations, libraries, and computer scientists to discuss the possibility of creating an open-access, national digital library,” Darnton said.
“Although at first the project seemed utopian, everyone agreed at the outset that we could do it and that we could find the money.”
But the DPLA’s identity is evolving as it develops beyond a Harvard-based project.
“We are in an embryonic phase, and the embryo has a big H birthmark on it,” Darnton said.
“That identity will fade with time. The DPLA should appeal to a broad constituency, and there is a danger that the Harvard label could be taken as ‘elitist.’”
Darnton said that he wants the library to be open to “readers from every stripe,” and not just a tool for research-oriented professors—one of the reasons that he said shedding the Harvard label is critical.
The DPLA will decide how to pursue further digitization efforts after the database is established.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When parents refuse to pay Harvard tuition, undergraduates and Harvard administrators can find themselves in a difficult situation.
Take Jessica. After her parents told her that they wouldn’t pay their expected contribution, she enrolled at Harvard anyway. Here, she has spent three-and-a-half years studying as a full-time student at the College and working multiple jobs, sometimes totalling up to 40 hours of work a week.
Jessica, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy, is one of a handful of students at the College whose parents have refused to pay the expected parent contribution included in their financial aid packages. Though Jessica’s parents, one of whom is a doctor, do not contribute to the cost of her education, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid still insists that she pay between $16,000 to $20,000 a year out of her own pocket.
“The College’s attitude is ‘your dad is a doctor, why aren’t your parents helping?’ In that sense, it can be really frustrating,” Jessica said of her situation. “Just because the parent contribution is called the parent contribution, you don’t know about my family.”
Still, Jessica and others who face similar situations recognize that a parent refusing to pay tuition is a problem with no easy solution.
Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue says her office works to be “fair and equitable,” aiming to support students whose parents will not contribute to the cost of tuition. But Harvard—and many other colleges with generous financial aid offerings—make students undergo a rigorous process that includes counseling before considering waiving the family’s financial obligations to the school. Donahue says conflicts between parents and their children rarely reach the point where the University accepts that a parent will not pay.
ACCEPTING THE DEBT
Two thirds of Harvard students will graduate from the College with no debt. That won’t be the case for Jessica.
Four years ago—before she ever sat down to eat in Annenberg Hall—her parents told her that they wouldn’t pay for her to go to Harvard. After all, she had already been offered generous scholarships from a number of top tier universities. Several schools even gave her a full ride. But, Jessica said, it had to be Harvard.
Looking for advice and help getting student loans, Jessica communicated with Harvard’s Financial Aid Office.
“I found they were judging. What would have been ideal is that they didn’t pass judgment,” Jessica said. “Frankly, it’s none of their business.”
Ultimately, Jessica estimated that she will graduate with between $10,000 and $20,000 in debt, after spending a summer at a top-tier consulting firm and holding down several term-time jobs.
Every week students visit the Financial Aid Office to report new and extenuating circumstances concerning their financial aid package, according to Donahue. While these cases take a variety of forms, Donahue said that the office works with students and families on an individual basis to reach a solution.
“There are a number of situations that can arise that alienate students from their families,” Donahue said. “There’s no formula because you really have to deal with each one these situations individually. Many students are away from home for the first time and are growing in directions that parents might not approve. Consequently, there are bound to be conflicts that arise between students and parents, some of a more severe nature than others.”
In cases where there is an extreme rift between students and parents, the Financial Aid Office refers students to University Health Services and the Bureau of Study Council in hopes that these offices can work to a resolution of the problem.
“Our top priorities, and the top priorities of Harvard College, are the students’ health and well-being and their continued enrollment,” Donahue said. “Family dynamics can be incredibly explosive and complex and the resources necessary to support students in these situations often extend well beyond the Financial Aid Office.”
A report by Center for American Progress on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender on financial aid issues, however, criticizes an unspecified Ivy League university for requiring students to attend such counseling. In the report, a student named Colin—whose parents cut him off financially after he came out as gay—alleges that the Ivy League university required a psychologist to sign off on his sanity. In the report, he said that entire process “absolutely terrified me.”
Representatives of University Health Services did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Donahue said that students can access loans to cover the cost of continued enrollment at the College even while other offices work with students and their families.
“There have only been a small handful of occasions in which it has been deemed by the collection of offices working with a particular student that the situation was completely irreconcilable,” Donahue said. “Those situations are real exceptions and ones that take a significant amount of time and conversations and resources to make that decision.”
Donahue said that she is not aware of a student leaving the College in the last decade as a result of inability to pay caused by parental conflict.
Still, though Harvard insists that it has a process for handling such difficult situations, the procedure can be daunting for students.
PARENTAL ORDERS
Marsha, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy, came out as gay in the spring of her freshman year. After returning home for the summer, her parents told her that they had decided to stop paying her tuition and that she would have to find something new to do when her summer job ended.
“It was one of the worst experiences of my life. I cried myself to sleep every night,” she said. “I just had no idea what I would do when the summer was over.”
After spending the summer contemplating her future, Marsha—whose family did not receive any financial aid from Harvard—decided to join the military.
But four days before Marsha had been scheduled to return to campus, her parents informed her that they had changed their minds and that she could return to Harvard on a conditional basis. At the end of each semester, they would reconsider whether to continue paying. Among the requirements were that she improve her GPA, attend church on a regular basis, and quit her sport.
“My actual thought was sweet Jesus, I hope my parents will still pay because I guess I’m going to such debt if they don’t,” she said. “If I couldn’t complete four years at Harvard, I thought that the rest of the course of my life would be far worse than it could be.”
Concerned that her parents would change their minds, Marsha visited the Financial Aid Office where she was told that parents often use tuition as leverage when they want something from their children. Marsha said that potential plan was much like what Donahue described. Should Marsha have needed it, the Office would have offered her loans while attempting to resolve the situation.
Regardless of Harvard’s ability to deal with such situations, Marsha’s parents’ last-minute decision had been a fateful one, Marsha said. She would not have otherwise thought to reach out to the Financial Aid Office.
“Harvard puts the student in a very difficult place. It’s almost like a front that they offer so much help, because in the end you’re stuck between the institution and your parents,” Marsha said about the situation for students whose parents are hostile to their child’s sexual orientation.
This is at the heart of the issue, according to Crosby Burns, who authored the report on LGBT financial aid issues in higher education for the Center for American Progress.
“In my research ... even universities such as Harvard, while they might be progressive and give a lot of aid, they aren’t perfect,” Burns said, emphasizing that universities should do a better job explaining their policies.
The majority of students contacted by The Crimson declined to share their full stories. Still, Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of financial aid assistance website finaid.org, said that parental refusal to cooperate is a national issue. His website receives thousands of emails each year from students looking for help when their parents refuse to pay as expected, he said.
Conflicts about a student’s sexual orientation, religion, friends, or significant other are among the issues that Kantrowitz said often cause such a split.
Kantrowitz’s recommendations to students facing such situations largely coincide with the way Harvard’s Financial Aid Office handles them. Kantrowitz first recommends that students reach out to parents to try to reconcile the situation. If such an attempt is unsuccessful, he recommends that students pursue a dependency override, which lifts the student’s financial burden. To attain such an override, he said, would require documentation from a neutral third party—someone such as a social worker, teacher, or a family friend.
Although some students attain such an override, Kantorwitz said students facing a steep tuition bill with no parental support often attend community college or work for a few years in hopes of saving money before college.
Despite the unfortunate circumstances that students often face, nearly everyone The Crimson spoke with agreed that it would be difficult for the University to loosen its policy without inviting the possibility of students requesting additional assistance unnecessarily.
“Harvard always tries to be as fair as possible. In this situation they couldn’t really say because you’re gay, we’re going to help you out,” Marsha said. “They give the same treatment to every student, which they should do.”
“Our goal is to be fair and equitable across the student population,” Donahue said. “It wouldn’t be fair if we quickly said to one student, ‘Oh, your parents won’t contribute. No problem. Here you go.’ Because there are many other families in which students and parents might be working out a very difficult situation and somehow working through it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard psychology professor Marc D. Hauser responded publicly to Princeton philosophy professor Gilbert Harman’s accusation that Hauser failed to adequately credit another scholar in his 2006 book, Moral Minds.
Hauser resigned from the University in August after a three-year-long internal investigation found him guilty of eight counts of scientific misconduct.
Harman recently posted an essay on his website claiming Hauser’s book drew unfairly from Georgetown law professor and then-Cornell graduate student John Mikhail’s doctoral thesis. He has since posted Hauser’s two page response to the accusations.
“Some of the central ideas of Hauser’s book and many of its details seemed to me to be clearly indebted to Mikhail’s work, although this indebtedness was mostly unmentioned,” Harman wrote.
The essay discusses the similarities between Mikhail’s and Hauser’s work and raises the question of whether Hauser’s borrowing of ideas constitutes plagiarism.
Harman cited specific instances where he believes Mikhail deserves credit and lists various universities’ policies, including Harvard’s, that define theft of ideas as plagiarism. He declined to comment for this article.
Hauser’s response acknowledged Mikhail’s intellectual influence on his thinking but defended his citations as adequate.
According to Harman’s essay, Hauser cites Mikhail nine times in Moral Minds, including in the acknowledgments, where he wrote, “A special thanks ... to John Mikhail, whose thesis on Rawls’ linguistic analogy greatly influenced my own thinking.”
The “primary intellectual influence” for Moral Minds was MIT linguistics professor Noam Chomsky, Hauser wrote in his response.
“These accusations confuse ordinary intellectual influence for malfeasance, while grossly distorting the history of my ideas and their influence,” Hauser wrote.
“They gloss the important difference between an empirical synthesis/trade book and a philosophical treatise/academic book,” he wrote.
Harman noted in his essay that some of his colleagues disagree with his accusation that Hauser did not sufficiently cite Mikhail in his book as well as with his suggestion that it may constitute plagiarism.
Harman wrote that some of his colleagues say the “standards of appropriate citation are considerably relaxed for writing aimed at a wider audience.”
In his response, Hauser made a similar point. Harman’s standards, Hauser wrote, set up “criteria for citations that would make libraries of books and journal publications guilty, wrongly so.”
But whether or not Hauser’s work constitutes plagiarism, Harman wrote, it does make “inappropriate use of Mikhail’s work.”

Harvard University and Microsoft’s research division co-hosted a workshop this week to promote new platforms for presenting scientific research electronically.
Approximately 60 people from software and media companies attended a session on Monday morning featuring live demonstrations of about 20 innovative “eScience” technology products that could enhance research and dissemination of technical knowledge.
Moshe Pritsker, CEO, editor-in-chief, and co-founder of Journal of Visualized Experiments, gave a 10-minute demonstration of his project JoVe—a platform that incorporates video multimedia into scientific presentations.
“We think the traditional paper-format research publication is very unproductive,” Pritsker said.
“People can get lost reading the content they are not familiar with,” he said.
Pritsker said the platform has three parts—introduction, animation and experimental procedures—corresponding to the abstract, experimental design, description of the results, and other components found in a conventional research paper. With JoVe, scientists can more easily communicate temporal aspects of their results, such as change in a given metric over time—a result integral to many life science experiments.
“We think JoVe can overcome the inherent limitations of traditional, static print journals, thereby adding an entirely new parameter to the communication of experimental data and research results,” Pritsker said.
Zooniverse was another new technology, presented by Chris Lintott, director of Citizen Science at the Adler Planetarium.
Lintott said he believes that Zooniverse—a website that solicits online users to participate in citizen science research—could provide laypersons with an entry point to a variety of scientific research projects.
The site, which helps researchers collect data from hundreds of thousands of users, also has potential as a tool of scientific education, Lintott said.
For example, one of Zooniverse’s projects asks users to classify galaxies according to their shapes—a task that the human brain performs better than even the most advanced computer—in order to collect data that could lead to a better understanding on how these galaxies were formed. Participants can also gain a better understanding of astronomy.
“I think the real live demonstrations of the workshop really help people to understand the point of these projects better,” said Gregory J. Gordon, president & CEO at Social Science Research Network, a participant of the workshop. “It’s also interesting to see these applications are expanding into the social science sphere as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who played under former Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra conductor James Yannatos will remember him as the man who stood at the podium during rehearsals in his brightly colored turtlenecks and corduroys. His precise movements of the baton would inspire both pre-professional and casual musicians for 45 years as they passed through Harvard’s halls.
Yannatos died last week at his home of complications from lung cancer. He was 82.
Yannatos, who lived in Cambridge with his wife and two kids, came to Harvard in 1964 as a lecturer and the music director for the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra.
At the time, the orchestra was vastly different from the 90 member undergraduate ensemble it is today—it was an eclectic congregation of a few undergraduates, alumni, and affiliates who were able to play instruments.
Over his 45-year tenure as the conductor for the orchestra, Yannatos transformed HRO to the organization it is today, an all-undergraduate collective that plays with a distinguished repertoire and a loyal following.
To those who knew him at Harvard, “Dr. Y” was the mentor and leader who cared about the students as much as he cared about the music they made together.
He always remained mindful that his students would have to balance their coursework with their twice-a-week rehearsals.
Y. Diana Tsen ’11, a former HRO president, remembers Yannatos’ remark to seeing his orchestra suffer from the midterm slump one year.
“Tough day at the office?” Yannatos said to the dazed crowd of student musicians, according to Tsen.
Yannatos was aware that his students, experienced and well-versed in musical talent, had come from a variety of backgrounds, said Norman L. Letvin ’71, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who played in Yannatos’ orchestra all four years while he was an undergraduate.
“He had the ability of finding the right mix of how to push students and really understanding that it’s hard to switch gears as a student,” Letvin said.
Victor M. Lee ’05, a former HRO violinist, remembers the encouragement that Yannatos would provide in pushing the orchestra forward to try new types of music.
Yannatos hosted listening parties at his home after every performance, where students from the orchestra would be invited to listen to the soundtrack of their latest performance. At the listening party for Yannatos’ final performance, a group of orchestra members showed up in turtlenecks as a tribute to their outgoing mentor, Tsen said.
“For a small guy, he had a big presence,” Lee said. “He was like a grandfather to most people in the organization.”
Yannatos always had a certain youthfulness about him, said Eugene W. Lee ’10, a former president of HRO.
In 2009, Yannatos retired from directing HRO, which celebrated its 200th anniversary the year before. But Yannatos did not retire his support for the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra.
In a meeting to pass his baton to current director Federico Cortese, Yannatos, Cortese recalled, said in an affectionate tone: “You will love this job.”
“It meant a great deal to him to share his love of music,” said Nyia Yannatos, his wife. “He felt it was part of his mission as a teacher to pass that on.”
Nyia said that Yannatos was delighted at the start of each term to see how the orchestra would come together from the previous year.
“He cared about you as a musician and how you were going to grow as a person after you left Harvard,” Victor Lee said.
On the night of his last concert with HRO, Yannatos was awarded an honorary certificate for his decades of contributions to the orchestra. The certificate declared Harvard’s gratitude to how Yannatos “enhanced the cultural life of Harvard University” while “enriching the lives of thousands” with his music knowledge, artistry, and passion.
Yannatos was not only a conductor and instructor, but also a violinist and a composer.
In 1971, he wrote an opera titled “Rockets’ Red Blare,” which premiered at Harvard as a student production.
On Oct. 1 and 2, 2011, Intermezzo, the New England Chamber Opera Series, performed his rewritten score to “Rockets’ Red Blare” in a professional debut at the Agassiz Theater, which Yannatos attended.
“He died with his founding awareness, humor, courage, love, and profound grace, and peacefully,” his daughter Kayla wrote in an obituary for her father.
Yannatos is survived by his wife Nyia, daughter Kayla, and son Dion.
A public memorial service will be held on Dec. 10 at 3 p.m. in Sanders Theatre.

High levels of multiple hormones, particularly estrogen and testosterone, increase the risk of breast cancer, according to a study published recently by researchers from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.
The findings could make it easier to predict an individual’s risk of breast cancer, which affects as many as one in eight American women over the course of their lifetime.
The team’s study, which analyzed the impact of interacting hormones on cancer growth, filled a gap in research on the factors influencing breast cancer, according to co-author Shelley S. Tworoger, assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health.
Previous studies have focused on the influence of hormones only in isolation, Tworoger said.
“This research changes how we may look at risk prediction in the future,” she said.
The researchers were able to take advantage of samples from the Nurses’ Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 American female nurses.
In what Tworoger describes as a “huge undertaking,” 32,826 of the study’s participants individually drew their own blood in 1989 and 1990 before sending their sample in for analysis. In follow-ups years later, the study then drew upon 320 confirmed breast cancer patients from the sample, analyzing levels of estrogens, androgens, and prolactin.
“Our ultimate goal would be to be able to identify women who are at a high risk of breast cancer so they can take preventive action,” said Tworoger
While current risk-prediction models, which take into account family and individual health history, can describe trends within a population, Tworoger said that establishing an accurate risk-prediction model for individuals remains a challenge.
More research is necessary to determine the implications of the researchers’ findings, Tworoger said. She said that drawing upon an even larger sample size would enable researchers to answer more key questions about the influence of hormones on risk rates.
In the future, for instance, Tworoger said she would like to confirm indications in the study that estrogens may have a slightly stronger influence on breast cancer risk than androgens.
Tworoger said she is working with researchers at Oxford to obtain access to a much larger, international dataset. But she said the end results of this research is still “several years away.”
“I think the most important thing is that more research is needed about how these hormones influence the risk of breast cancer,” said Tworoger. “If we can identify the best way to predict cancer risk using hormones, women who are at a higher risk could take medication which blocked their effects.”

Former Harvard Corporation Fellow and famed presidential biographer John M. Blum ’43 died Oct. 17 from complications with pneumonia at his home in Branford, Conn. He was 90.
The longtime Yale history professor and holder of four Harvard degrees gained national recognition for his 1954 biography of Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880.
The biography, “The Republican Roosevelt,” helped redefine the former President’s legacy. In the book, Blum argued that Roosevelt had revitalized the presidency after years of institutional decline following the Civil War. Though popular opinion at the time of publication held Roosevelt as an average, if not whimsical leader, Blum’s scholarship established the 26th president’s reputation as a watershed figure.
Blum served as a Fellow of The Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—from 1970 to 1979, helping to lead the University through nearly a decade of change. At the time of his selection, Blum was the first professor to join the Corporation while actively teaching at another University.
One of Blum’s first tasks upon joining the Corporation was to help lead the search process for a new University president. The Corporation ultimately chose Derek C. Bok to replace outgoing president, Nathan M. Pusey ’28. Blum’s term also coincided with the merger of Radcliffe and Harvard in 1977.
“[Blum] had joined the Corporation just a couple of years before at a time when the University was beset by student protests. Together with another new member, Charles Slichter, he gave the Corporation a faculty presence and provided much insight and good advice about university affairs,” Bok wrote in an email.
Born in Manhattan on April 29, 1921, Blum was raised on Long Island and was the oldest of three children. Though his father was a businessman and inventor, Blum relied on scholarships and his own part-time jobs to pay his way through Phillips Academy and ultimately Harvard.
Blum graduated from Harvard College in 1943 and shortly thereafter joined the Navy, serving in the South Pacific for the remainder of World War II. After the war, he decided to return to Harvard, earning a master’s degree in 1947 and a Ph.D. in history in 1950. Harvard presented Blum with an honorary law degree in 1980, as well.
Blum’s professional career began in 1948 at M.I.T., where he taught for nine years before taking a position at Yale in 1957. Blum remained at Yale until his retirement in 1991, teaching some of Yale’s most famous political graduates, including George W. Bush and John F. Kerry. Harvard University Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was also a student and mentee of Blum.
“I learned a lot about writing from John Blum, and I learned a lot about history from John Blum. It was like the laying on of the hands,” Gates said in an National Endowment for the Humanities interview in 2002. Gates could not be reached for comment for this article.
Much of Blum’s most famous work was completed while at M.I.T. and in his early years at Yale. He wrote more than 15 books and contributed to various others, mostly concerning the American presidency. Blum helped popularize the study of presidential biography, tracing the personal traits and lives of presidents to their policy and leadership. His books included biographies on Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, and Theodore Roosevelt, as well as detailed, multi-volume histories of the New Deal and World War II. Blum also authored an American history textbook and a memoir.
“His writings shaped historians’ understanding of Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and other figures in what was once the liberal mainstream of American public life,” wrote Harvard History Professor James T. Kloppenberg in an email. “A moderate who tried to mediate between radicals and conservatives at Yale, Blum remained resolutely, unapologetically focused on the centrality of politics in American history.”
Blum served as chair of the Yale History Department and was considered to be a top candidate for the position of president of the university. Though he never rose any higher than professor, Blum was an enormously influential figure on campus, and a favorite of students.
“I particularly remember him for his unfailing good humor and wise judgment and for his kindness to me as a new president in difficult times,” Bok said.
Notably, Blum—who was not a movie fan—made a cameo appearance in Woody Allen’s 1983 mock-documentary “Zelig,” playing a fictional historian with expertise on the documentary’s title character.
Blum is survived by his wife Pamela Zink Blum and three children. A memorial service will be held Nov. 11 at Yale’s Battell Chapel.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: OCT. 25, 2011
Due to an editing error, the Oct. 25 article "John Blum, Former Harvard Corporation Member, Dies at 90" incorrectly identified Franklin D. Roosevelt as a member of the Class of 2004. He was a member of the Class of 1904.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday night one week ago, Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Brandon Marshall was in New York, going one-on-one with Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis on national television.
But this Monday night, Marshall was going head-to-head with a very different demographic—Harvard students, whom he spoke to about his personal experience with borderline personality disorder.
Marshall, a two-time Pro Bowler, was diagnosed with BPD at Boston’s McLean Hospital in July, three months after he was allegedly stabbed in the stomach by his wife, Michi Nogami-Marshall.
The athlete underwent three months of treatment and therapy at McLean, where he said he learned to cope with the mental illness, which is marked by instability in relationships, self-image, mood, and emotion.
After hearing a student express admiration for Marshall’s willingness to speak openly about his mental illness, Paul J. Barreira, director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling at Harvard, invited the NFL star to speak to undergraduates about his disorder. He said Marshall accepted immediately.
The receiver’s speech, titled “Mental Illness Isn’t a Game Stopper,” addressed his experiences with BPD, which he said prevented him from appreciating his life.
“I lived in a bubble,” Marshall said. “I became unattached, unemotional ... The things that made me relevant or successful were the things that began to ruin me. It got to the point where it consumed me, it took over me, it controlled me.”
Marshall, in his first public speech on his disorder, explained that treatment at McLean, which included dialectical behavior therapy, taught him how to turn off his emotional “switch” by not bottling things up and that a “lack of expression equals depression.”
As an example, Marshall explained that when unhappy with the Dolphins’ playbook before the Jets game last week, he was able to talk through his displeasure with Nogami-Marshall rather than letting his anger get the best of him.
“It was truly a blessing to be around people that understood me, that spoke my language, that could help me,” said Marshall, who added that he still Skypes with his doctors during the season. “The treatment gave me the opportunity to live again, to enjoy life, enjoy my successes.”
In his introduction, Barreira cited a recent study that found that 44 percent of Harvard students who felt they needed psychological counseling didn’t ask for it because they didn’t think it worked.
Marshall said that was the type of statistic he was trying to fight against, explaining that he could relate to the stress and pressure undergraduates felt during their daily lives.
“Please use my experience and take the good out of it,” said Marshall, who was presented with a personalized Harvard football jersey by Crimson captain Alex A. Gedeon ’12 after the event. “If you might need help, get help, and if its your friends and family, inspire them as well ... You’re not blessed unless you’re a blessing to others.”
Attendees also viewed a clip from a documentary currently in production that depicts Marshall’s struggle with BPD, which he said he hopes will help others cope with mental illness. The receiver said he got the idea to turn his experiences into a film from his wife, who, while being put into a police car after her arrest in April, told him, “Someone will learn from this.”
Marshall added that his speech at Harvard would be the final scene in the documentary.
The receiver said his long-term goal would be to use his celebrity to become a face of mental health and to try to break the stigmas that accompany it. With his voice starting to crack, he said that without treatment, he would probably be out of the NFL and divorced.
“God is good,” Marshall said. “He answered my prayer just in time.”

The New College Theatre will be renamed Farkas Hall following a significant donation from Andrew L. Farkas ’82.
The NCT is best known for housing the annual show of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, of which Farkas served as president for two years when he was an undergraduate at the College.
"My times at the Hasty Pudding were amongst the most joyful and memorable," Farkas said in a release. "That generations of Harvard students will learn, grow, and flourish in Farkas Hall, in the building that has been the ancestral home of the Pudding and all of the organizations it has spawned, is a great privilege for the Farkas family."
Farkas is the CEO of Island Capital Group, a real estate merchant bank based in New York City.
"This is definitely going to put us forward," said Ian Shields ’13, who is the technology vice president of the Theatricals. "Improvements are going to be made to the theater, and there are definitely things that can be done."
The renaming represents an endowed commitment by the Farkas family to maintain the NCT.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Spokesperson Jeff Neal said the School would not disclose the amount of the gift out of respect for donor privacy.
Formerly known as the Hasty Pudding Theatre, the NCT was rebuilt from 2005 to 2007 with only the façade and lobby of the 1888 building maintained. The Harvard Krokodiloes and Radcliffe Pitches often use the theater space as well.

After spending the last 10 years teaching and conducting research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., economics professor and Nobel laureate Eric S. Maskin ’72 will return to Harvard in the spring.
Maskin, who was the Louis Berkman professor of economics at Harvard from 1985 to 2000, won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007 for laying the foundations of mechanism design theory, a field within game theory.
Maskin will teach Economics 1052: “Game Theory and Economic Applications” in the spring, and he plans to teach a course in social choice theory in the fall of 2012.
According to a number of faculty members in the Economics Department, his presence on campus will be welcomed.
“He’ll be a very forceful intellectual presence,” said economics professor Oliver S. Hart. “I think there’s a lot of happiness in the department about him coming back.”
During his 15-year tenure at Harvard, Maskin co-taught courses with Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya K. Sen and prominent political philosopher Robert Nozick. He was also the head tutor for applied math concentrators specializing in economics and served on the committee responsible for designing the quantitative reasoning component of Harvard’s core curriculum.
According to Maskin, the time-intensive nature of his committee work, combined with his tendency to overcommit, contributed to his decision in 2000 to move to the Institute.
“It wasn’t that Harvard was deliberately trying to overwork me, but I think I had a tendency to take on more things out of enthusiasm than were good for me,” Maskin said.
Maskin was drawn to the Institute for Advanced Study—a theoretical research center closely affiliated with Princeton University—partly because of the Institute’s fewer responsibilities.
“The position at the Institute was very attractive,” Maskin said. “It gave me a lot of freedom to do what I wanted to, and gave me an affiliation with the Princeton Economics Department.” During his time at the Institute, Maskin also served as a visiting lecturer at Princeton.
But 10 years later, Maskin cites “personal, emotional, and intellectual” reasons for returning to Harvard.
Maskin first began his career at Harvard as a math concentrator in the College and then moved on to complete a doctoral degree in applied math.
He said that he was first inspired to pursue economics after taking a course taught by Kenneth J. Arrow, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics the year that Maskin graduated from the College.
After a year of work as a research fellow at the University of Cambridge, and eight years as a professor at MIT, Maskin returned to his alma mater in 1985.
“I have a strong attachment to Harvard,” Maskin said. “I’ve got a lot of strong friends in the department, who I’ve taught with before.”
One such friend, economics rofessor Jerry R. Green, has been in touch with Maskin ever since Green taught a seminar that Maskin enrolled in as a senior at the College.
“He was not only a strong researcher and a dedicated teacher, but a great servant of the University,” Green said of Maskin’s previous tenure at Harvard. “He is everything a faculty member should be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High trans fat consumption by mothers during the second trimester of pregnancy is linked to larger babies, according to a study conducted at the Harvard School of Public Health exploring the impact of trans fats on fetal growth.
"We’ve been worried about the effects of trans fats for years," said HSPH Associate Professor Eric B. Rimm, co-writer of the study.
The results suggest that trans fats are not only harmful for adults—among whom high trans fat consumption can lead to increased risk of coronary heart disease—but also for their babies.
The babies appear to have a higher risk for adult diabetes and obesity later in life, according to Juliana F. W. Cohen, lead writer and a student at the HSPH. In addition, mothers of larger children may require Caesarean sections.
"It’s amazing that something we consume in such small amounts could have such large implications," said Rimm, who emphasized that women who are pregnant should remain conscious of their trans fat consumption, especially at restaurants.
With each incremental increase in trans fat consumption during the second trimester, babies grew marginally. To compare fetal growth and adjust for the length of gestation, the researchers used "Z-scores," the measurement of a baby’s birth weight corresponding to the baby’s week of birth.
Trans fats appear to block the transfer to the fetus of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid often found in fish, according to Cohen. Previous Harvard research has linked DHA to decreased fetal growth.
Researchers surveyed almost 1,400 women who completed questionnaires about their diets during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. There was no correlation between trans fat consumption and fetal growth during the first trimester.
Trans fats often occur in processed foods, such as french fries, baked goods, and commercial junk foods. Natural foods, such as milk and meat, also contain trans fats in slightly lower quantities. The study—to be published in the upcoming November issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition—indicated that both sources of trans fats led to larger children.
Although researchers focused primarily on the effects of trans fats, the questionnaires tracked consumption of a wide range of foods.
Researchers adjusted for potentially distorting factors—including race, socioeconomic status, and income—by including these variables in their model.
But more research into the topic is still necessary said Cohen, noting that other variables could have created inconsistencies in the data.
"I definitely recommend that future studies look into this association," Cohen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard senior Collier Winters stepped onto the field this weekend, the pressure to perform was elevated more than ever before as he returned to his starting role at quarterback.
With an additional stress on his shoulders, Winters not only quieted skeptics, he put on one of the best performances in Crimson football history.
Entering the game against Princeton, Winters was replacing the defending back-to-back Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week, junior Colton Chapple, at quarterback. While Winters had been out with a hamstring injury, his backup tied the school record for the most touchdowns thrown in a single game, with five.
Despite Chapple’s consistently dominant performances, Harvard coach Tim Murphy kept faith in his senior, and gave Winters the start against Princeton.
“Collier is a fifth-year senior, and he came back, was healthy, and showed that he could play in practice this week,” said freshman Ivy Special Teams Player of the Week Seitu Smith III. “It’s hard for the coaches to decide between two quarterbacks that have played so well, but I think it comes down to senior leadership.”
After battling for the starting job in each of the past two seasons, Winters seemed to have the spot locked up heading into his final semester at school. But strong performances by Chapple put his spot in jeopardy once again.
“Of course he had something to prove,” Smith said. “Being the upperclassman senior quarterback, he’s supposed to be the leader of the team, leading us to the Ivy League Championship this year. It was an HYP [Harvard-Yale-Princeton] rivalry game, so he had to play hard to prove to the fans, the coaches, and the league that he’s still one of the top players.”
Winters silenced anyone questioning Murphy’s decision on the Crimson’s second drive of the game. Showing no signs of rust, the senior QB marched the offense 69 yards down the field and ultimately took the ball in himself for a one-yard touchdown run.
“You expect it from Collier,” Smith said. “When he sees the goal line, he’s not pitching the ball.”
On the next drive, Winters went to the air, leading Harvard on an impressive aerial attack. Picking apart the Tiger defense with throws to junior running back Treavor Scales and sophomore receiver Matt Brown, Winters helped carry the team 74 yards downfield. He capped off the drive with a 29-yard touchdown pass as he went back to Brown in the end zone.
Over the next three quarters, Winters continued to rely on his arm and racked up over 400 yards in his first game back. While some would look to get comfortable with a “go-to” receiver after missing several starts, Winters ran a balanced offense throughout. In total, the senior threw a record-tying five touchdowns to five separate receivers.
During Winters’ mammoth aerial barrage on Princeton’s secondary, the Crimson offense found balance in its rushing game as well. Harvard ended the game with three more rushing attempts (45) than passing attempts (42), and finished with just shy of 160 yards on its feet. Winters himself ran for 29 yards on 14 attempts. This dynamic offense kept the Tigers on edge.
“Collier’s rushing opened up the playbook and stretched the defense for the receivers,” Smith said.
When Winters went to the air, he did so with precision. The quarterback missed only eight of 42 pass attempts, and threw only one interception, which occurred midway through the second quarter.
As the Tigers gained momentum in the third quarter, putting up 22 points in less than ten minutes, Harvard turned to Winters to stop the bleeding.
At the onset of the fourth quarter, the senior led two consecutive touchdown drives of 67 and 42 yards, respectively. Harvard’s 35 second-half points proved too much for Princeton to overcome.
Posting a 56-39 victory for the Crimson was only the beginning to Winters’ weekend. For the third consecutive week, a Harvard quarterback received the coveted Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week honors. This weekend, the award went to Winters.
“I prepared this week to come out and hopefully play up to my potential,” Winters said. “I felt for the most part I did that today.”
Entering Saturday, a plethora of questions surrounded the decision to start Winters at quarterback. It would seem as though the senior’s performance on the field answered any that remain.
“The thing about Collier is that he’s just relentless,’’ Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He doesn’t have a lot of patience like a lot of successful people. He’s always got this sense of urgency.’’
After the performances that Chapple put up, Winters needed a standout performance, and he delivered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My Head of the Charles experience began earlier than most, as the regatta’s announcer somehow projected the lineup of the “Grand Master Singles 50+” up five stories to my room in Eliot, gracing me with a complementary early-morning wakeup call on Saturday.
But like the game-day tunes the band plays on its rowdy morning jaunts down JFK, the man’s voice served, more than anything else, as a reminder that there’s a vibrant athletic event taking place right in our backyard.
Riverside gates were locked, non-Harvard guests required to sign in, and students warned against the dangers of renting out your room to strangers, as Harvard readied itself to host the largest two-day rowing competition in the world.
And as it turns out, Head of the Charles isn’t just about rowing.
On day one, I occupied myself by wandering the banks of the river—maneuvering my way through the crowd and narrowly escaping the wrath of a man barreling down the riverbank with a baby carriage—on a quest for free food and the most interesting “stuff” the regatta had to offer.
I wasn’t disappointed. As boats made their way upstream, venders handed out free hummus, soy protein shakes, energy drinks, programs—you name it—to a sea of restless bystanders. The hectic array of stands even featured a virtual reality coffee shop, an erg station, an assortment of large pillow-like seats, and a blow-up obstacle course, catering to just about everyone on the river’s edge.
A Brooks Brothers booth displayed a line of regatta-themed sweaters and jackets, complete with Head of the Charles insignia. I didn’t stop to check, but based on the conspicuous lack of a crowd around that particular area, I’m assuming none of it was complementary.
The boats whistling by in the background seemed to be an afterthought to a mob of tall, built individuals fighting their way toward a stack of granola bars.
Occasionally, I stopped my riverside explorations in hopes of engrossing myself in a race, but the near impossibility of knowing exactly which race was in progress at any given moment left me feeling a little out of touch despite being so close to the action. I partially staved my craving for involvement in the actual athletic event by comparing the various teams’ form and quickly determining Princeton’s neon pink shirts to be the boldest fashion choice of the day.
It wasn’t until Sunday afternoon that I watched a race in its entirety.
I stationed myself, as previously instructed by my rower roommate, next to the Weld Boathouse. From my vantage point between Anderson and Weeks, I’d get the best view of any carnage that the 90-plus-degree turn at the footbridge might elicit and get to see a solid stretch of racing.
Soon after I arrived on the scene at 3:00 p.m., the first women’s championship eight traveled smoothly by as I spent the subsequent, stressful few minutes counting bows to be sure I didn’t miss number 14.
The boat emerged, neck-and-neck with bow 13, as the dual-like nature of the stretch between bridges made the staggered start even more exciting.
The action was over as quickly as it began with just a few minutes elapsing between the boat’s entrance into and departure from my line of vision. I yelled my roommate’s nickname a little too loudly and noted, to no one in particular, “They look really good.”
It wasn’t until later that night that I found out the Radcliffe heavyweight 1V placed second in a field of 39, making it to the finish in an impressive 16:19.63. Virginia edged the Black and White by 8.11 seconds to earn the overall victory.
From a spectator’s point of view, a regatta can be more difficult to watch and understand than a sport played on a field or court. A three-mile course isn’t exactly conducive to a start-to-finish watching experience, unless of course you ride your bike alongside the rowers—a feat attempted by only the most brazen of spectators at a regatta as large as Head of the Charles.
Because all of the races at this particular regatta are time trials, it’s not even clear which team is winning until times are announced after each race.
But maybe a logical viewing experience isn’t the point of this kind of event; rather, Head of the Charles seems to be more about tradition, atmosphere, and excitement—at least for inexperienced spectators like myself.
Between the constant competition on the water and seemingly unrelated amusements on land, Head of the Charles is an event not to be missed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was an unpredictable weekend for the Harvard sailing team, as poor weather conditions caused the sailors to compete under unfavorable circumstances and forced several regattas to call off entire days of racing.
SHERMAN HOYT TROPHY
The Crimson sent a youthful contingent to the Sherman Hoyt Trophy, at Brown and co-hosted by nearby Boston College. The sailors fought breezy shifts of 90 degrees on Saturday, which died down on Sunday, but an on-land postponement caused a very late start, limiting the amount of completed races to six.
Freshman Gram Slattery and sophomore Sarah Pierson battled these conditions as skipper and crew respectively to take 14th in the A-division, taking four top-five finishes on the weekend.  The two finished the weekend with 70 points.
In the B-division, the freshman duo of Michael Drumm and Richard Bergsund found a bit more success than their A-division counterparts, placing in the top five in six of their races and earning 49 points on their way to an eighth-place finish out of the field of 18.
“We have figured each other out, and we trust each other a lot,” Drumm said.  “We are pretty comfortable with each other, and we were able to make decisions well.”
Harvard finished the regatta in 13th place overall. The Eagles would narrowly edge out Yale and College of Charleston for the overall victory.
STU NELSON TROPHY
The Crimson started off strong in the Stu Nelson Trophy, a women’s event hosted by Connecticut College, but Mother Nature had other plans. After a full day of racing on Saturday, the regatta was called off on Sunday due to a lack of wind.  With severe limitations due to the weather conditions, the results of the event will not be considered official, as the required three races in each division were not completed.
Harvard did have a strong showing on Saturday, the only day of sailing for the event. The senior pair of co-captain Alex Jumper and Emily Lambert finished Saturday sitting atop the A-division scoreboard. The tandem earned three top-five finishes out of its four races and ended the day with 18 points.
In the B-division, sophomores Morgan Russom and Isabel Ruane had a disqualification in their second race of the regatta that pushed them to the bottom of the scoreboard. With no wind on Sunday, the B-division was only able to complete two races.
Overall, the Crimson finished the regatta in seventh place with a score of 52 points, taking the tiebreaker over MIT, and only two points away from a three-way tie with the U.S. Naval Academy and Tufts.
138th RUDOLPH OBERG TROPHY
Harvard also competed at the 138th Rudolph Oberg Trophy—in-conference regatta—hosted by cross-town rival MIT. Light, shifting breezes on Sunday made conditions difficult, and long postponements interrupted the races as the sailors hoped for stronger winds.
The Crimson took ninth in the A-division behind freshman Brian Drumm and junior Nicholas Gordon. With four top-five finishes, Drumm and Gordon gave a very steady performance throughout the day, earning 93 points.
Sophomore Caitlin Watson and freshman Emma Smith sailed in the B-division, tallying one top-five finish. The pair did not start in the final race of the regatta, which hurt their score and gave them 117 points on the weekend and a 14th place finish.
In the C-division, the sophomore pair of Alice Kenney and Luke O’Connor took home one first-place finish, but eventually ended the weekend in 11th place.
At the end of the weekend, Harvard took in 12th place overall of the 16 teams, as Tufts, Dartmouth, and Vermont snapped up the top spots, respectively.
BC INVITATIONAL
The BC Invitational started under overcast skies and breezy conditions, continuing the trend of difficult weather conditions for the competitors from Cambridge. For yet another regatta, the racing was canceled on Sunday due to a lack of breeze.
“There was definitely a solid breeze, which was better for those who had bigger pairs,” sophomore Ames Lyman said.  “There was a ton of current, and it was a factor that I had personally never raced in a high-current situation like that.”
In the A-division, Lyman and sophomore Catherine Philbin earned three top-10 finishes, earning 116 points and finishing eighth.
Freshman Ansel Duff and classmate Ashleigh Inglis won a top-five finish in the B-division and ended the day with 135 points and an eighth place finish.
Yale won the regatta, edging out Dartmouth and Boston University. Harvard finished eighth overall.

It's not every day a student can listen to music from Korea, feast on  delights from India, and enjoy traditional dance from Mexico. But this  Friday, students can enjoy a variety of food, fun, and festivities at  Diversitas, a cultural celebration put on by the UC and the Harvard  Foundation from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday in Tercentenary Theater.  Over forty  cultural groups are slated to participate in the event, which will  include decorated tents from which clubs can dole out food and cultural  education and performances from such groups as Ballet Folklorico and the  Harvard Ballroom Dance Team.
Crystal Trejo '13, a UC member and the chairwoman of the Social Program Task Force, a committee  which is focused on diversity issues on campus, said  that the event was created in the hopes that it would breed more  intercultural communication among students.
"I think sometimes it becomes insulating to become really committed to a cultural group so you don't get to see the other amazing groups that exist," she said. "Cultural groups can sometimes be seen as some  of the exclusive groups on campus. We wanted to create a large event  that everyone could attend that could be free ... that could create a sense of unity among all of the groups."
Trejo  also said that the event, which is open to all students, is meant to be  a celebration of the Harvard Foundation, which celebrates it's 30th  anniversary this year, as well as the college's mission of  diversity.
"This event is also part of 375th Anniversary," Trejo said. "They have the same goal that we have."
Trejo says that she hopes students will come and experience this unique cultural event.
"The fact that we're using Tercentenary Theater makes this a historic event," she said.
Ultimately,  the UC hopes that students will take Diversitas as an opportunity to  get to know the many different cultures present at Harvard.

Standing in the Senior Common Room of Kirkland is a woman dressed as a man. It's Kirkland House's drag workshop, and she's going over how to dress like a drag king. Drag is terminology related to cross-dressing, and dressing in drag refers to wearing clothing typically associated with the opposite gender. The workshop, which took place Monday night, consisted of a presentation going over how males might dress as females and vice versa, gender-bending, and various other forms of drag.
For the first time ever, the BGLTS tutors in Kirkland organized a drag workshop as well as a march in drag to Adams house's annual Drag Night. According to the tutors, in 1980, Kirkland was known as the jock house and some Kirkland residents would harass LGBT students, most of who tended to live in Adams. At one low point, a group of Kirkland residents beat up an Adams resident because of his perceived sexuality. As a result, the Adams community decided to show their solidarity and parody the traditional Kirkland House formal by having a drag formal, which still exists today.
The workshop was to give people an idea of how to dress for the parade, which is set to kick off Adams Drag Night this Thursday. Kirkland will parade to Adams in drag and present the house with a giant glittery papier-mâché heart. The parade starts at 8:30 p.m. at Kirkland House.
