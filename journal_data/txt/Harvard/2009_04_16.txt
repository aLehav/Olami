He  was lying on his back in the lot, in spot number twenty-eight (because even at night, some things were meant to have order), watching the stars. He was discovering that the stars have no order, or at least none immediately discernable. He knew, of course, that there must be some pattern. Everything in nature, no matter how obscure, no matter how frequently, participated in the world’s rhythm. He believed deeply in such things. But just now he was feeling very small. For being unable to find the rhythm in something so vast. But he was comforted as he lay there, discovering that the order of things was/is/will be his smallness, lying in an empty parking lot, contemplating the vastness of the cosmos.He was lying on his back in the lot, in spot number twenty-eight (because even at night, all things have rhythm), watching the stars. He was thinking about string theory and a universe made up of sequences and series of vibrations, oscillating like the strings on his girlfriend’s guitar. He was remembering going to her concerts, to her gigs, feeling the vibration within and without his body. His chest resonated with the B string, the little hollow opposite his elbow quivered with the D. His lower regions quaked with the A. He was humming to himself, liking the idea that every fiber of his being had a note to call his own, lying in an empty parking lot, one with the universe.He was lying on his back in the lot, in spot number twenty-eight (because even at night, some things are random), watching the stars. He was wondering what happened if something sang the wrong note, if the natural rhythm were to be interrupted. How could anomalies exist in a world of patterns? He shuddered at the thought of imperfections. What if he was a mistake? It could be that what he called a mistake was just a new piece of the pattern. Egomaniacal perhaps, but look: the order was restored. He wallowed in uncertainty, lying in an empty parking lot, wondering at his existence.He was lying on his back in the lot, in spot number twenty-eight, watching the stars, when headlights swept across his body, and he heard a car engine slow, then cut off. A car door opening, slamming shut, the sound of high-heeled footsteps, and a shadow fell momentarily across his view of the cosmos. His girlfriend’s body settled on top of him, her head on his chest in spot twenty-eight, her feet clacking to a halt in stop twenty-nine. He suddenly felt very removed from the universe, from order, from rhythm, from anomaly. He no longer felt small. He stroked his girlfriend’s hair, lying in an empty parking lot, feeling human.

David V. Kimel ’05 graduated summa cum laude in Classics. He was half of 2005’s American Parliamentary Debate Team of the Year. And he has also written a children’s book. He seems vaguely aware of the unorthodoxy of his situation. While his debate friends were going off to law school, Kimel taught English in a South Korean steel factory instead. “It was like being in a Charles Dickens book,” he recalls. “It was at that time that I started looking back at happier times, especially my childhood.”Kimel now makes a living writing instructional material for Korean children, while seeking a publisher for his first story in English, “Max and Screecher, The Underbed Creature”—a twisted, witty poem about a boy who gets revenge on some bullies with the help of a fuzzy, hungry monster. The Israeli-born Kimel suspects that observers see a paradox in a Harvard-educated children’s author but waves the idea away, viewing his alma mater as a logical step towards such writing; it was children’s literature, after all, that awoke his love of learning.“In the beginning there were stories,” says Germanic Languages Professor Maria Tatar, chair of the Folklore and Mythology committee and one of Kimel’s mentors. “There wasn’t a generational divide.” Tatar’s popular course Literature and Arts A-17: “Childhood: Its History, Philosophy, and Literature” bridges this modern divide. At a university often considered overly stuffy and grown-up, she has tapped into an apparent longing for childhood.Tatar, who has translated and published numerous collections of classic fairy tales, seems pleased with what she perceives to be genuine interest. “Maybe students were looking for a gut. It sounds easier than, say, ‘Shakespeare’s Problem Plays,’” she reflects. “But there is something very mature about their approach. I think many are looking for a way to go back home, to work through their own childhoods.”In class, Tatar is both erudite and whimsical, eliciting quiet attention and gleeful laughter. Yet, as students left her lectures last week, no one would own up to considering a career in children’s literature. “It seems so easy to write, theoretically, but I’m scared children wouldn’t actually like my work,” says Leah D. Seifu ’11. The difficulty for Elizabeth Ryznar ’10 lies in finding inspiration. Ryznar is the founding president of Harvard College Stories for Orphans (HCSO), a student group that writes and illustrates personalized storybooks for children in international orphanages. With this, she’s built an outlet for aspiring writers, one that mitigates the difficulty of finding a starting point. “A lot of people enjoy the organization because the inspiration is built in, to a point,” she says. “Every child has a book that’s written personally for him based on his favorite animals and colors.”Shiv M. Gaglani ’10, however, did not find HCSO an adequate substitute for his desire to shape a wide audience. “It’s great what they’re doing,” he explains. “They’re really trying to help orphans. But what I’m trying to do is communicate science to children.” Gaglani, an Engineering Sciences concentrator, first became interested in writing through HCSO, where he realized that in a genre swamped with fairy tales, few books are scientifically educational.  “It got me thinking about the process more, and it got me thinking about how children think,” he says. “I started reading lots of children’s books at the Cambridge Public Library.”Seeing an opportunity to inspire children to consider issues like climate change, Gaglani began work on books about scientific processes. His first book is complete, and he is looking for an illustrator and a publishing company interested in his educational angle. Meanwhile, he is moving forward on a book about the carbon cycle in collaboration with published children’s author Claire A. Nivola.Gaglani stops short of envisioning a career in children’s books, though. “In general, I’m interested in communications. So I can definitely imagine doing this as a hobby,” he says.Marie K. Rutkoski, who received her Ph.D in English at Harvard, thinks differently about the children’s literature market. The author of last year’s young adult novel “The Cabinet of Wonders” and an assistant professor at Brooklyn College, Rutkoski found that getting hired in academia was harder than getting published. “In some ways, getting published in children’s literature is a little more open than publishing adult literature,” Rutkoski says. “It’s less hinged on who you might know.”Still, Tatar understands students’ concerns about writing. “We all labor under this delusion that it will be simple. The language is simple. The books are short. But Ted Geisel—Dr. Seuss—spent 18 months wrestling with ‘The Cat and the Hat,’” she points out. “A poem isn’t easy either, but it’s short.”“Then again, Margaret Wise Brown wrote ‘Goodnight Moon’ in a morning,” she adds.Back in her “Childhood” class, Tatar introduces a guest lecturer: Newbery Medal recipient Lois Lowry. Author of modern children’s classics such as “The Giver” and “Number the Stars,” Lowry explains the combination of inspiration and craftsmanship required in writing. “My characters come to me fully formed, with names. So, I always start by placing them in a situation where something is a little askew.”After her lecture, Lowry offered some words of caution in an interview. “Publishing is in dire straits because of the economy and technology,” Lowry warns. She feels the biggest pitfall, though, is more fundamental. “People who think they want to write children’s books should go out and read as many as they can. Many people think you can just write something cute and it’s a children’s book.”Kimel admits occasional frustration with his line of work, but he remains optimistic that those who love children’s literature will follow their passion. “Harvard attracts issues and power and money, but this can bring out even the best in people,” he says. “I think students will always want to be an exemplar in their own right, rather than taking the easy way out.”He smiles earnestly when asked for advice. “You have to believe in the possibility of magic a little bit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Tanya V. Bezreh ’95 walked through Harvard Yard last Saturday, a friend asked what it was like to be a Harvard graduate. “Doors really swung open for me,” Bezreh joked. “I had to make a lot of porn to get those doors to stop swinging open.” An alum who has made her name creating and starring in short erotic films, Bezreh is one of several Harvard students, past and present, who have embraced an industry not usually associated with the Harvard brand name.“There’s a persistent stereotype that Harvard isn’t about pleasure. It’s about brains,” said Michele S. Jaffe ’91. Now an author of young adult novels, Jaffe entered the world of fiction through her romance novels, which Amazon.com called “steamy… Do not lend this to your mother.”“The sex scenes are designed to turn you on,” she said. For Jaffe, the fact that she was a Harvard graduate served to help market her books because of the perceived incongruity between sex and intellect.Camilla A. Hrdy ’04, co-founder of the undergraduate sex magazine H Bomb, encountered a similar stereotype when launching her publication. Much of the publicity around H Bomb, she said, came from “the cool dichotomy about Harvard being about being smart and not thinking about sex.” But, continued Hrdy, that perceived dichotomy is not reflective of reality. “At least not for my friends,” she laughed.Bezreh said that, like Hrdy, she contemplated producing an erotic magazine during her years at Harvard. But in Bezreh’s case, the stereotype held her back.“It just didn’t seem appropriate,” she said. “Harvard is like, the most privileged thing that can happen. And making porn or making erotic stuff can be very stigmatizing... I was scared that it would mess up my career.”Bezreh later confronted her fear by creating the short film “Naughty Garden” and starring in the HBO special “Real Sex: Porn 101: XXXtra Credit,” a documentary about her making the film. “For me,” she said. “I had to go overboard.”“Naughty Garden,” which cast several MIT and Harvard students, is “very spanking-oriented,” she said.Bezreh has followed up “Naughty Garden” with “Coming Out Spanko,” which portrays Bezreh’s process of confronting her fear and coming to terms with her sexual fantasies. It won Best Documentary Short in the 2008 CineKink Film Festival.For Bezreh, creating these films is part of a personal mission to come to terms with the shame she has felt about her fascination with sadomasochism and her greater mission to dispel the stigma associated with kink. Bezreh works as a life coach for people dealing with similar issues. She is also working toward a Master Degree in health communications through a joint program with Emerson and Tufts. Although Bezreh is not alone in experimenting in erotica, other Harvard students and alumni have had different motivations for their participation in the industry.Matthew di Pasquale ’09 made waves last September by publishing Diamond Magazine which featured him posing nude. When asked why he founded the magazine, Pasquale said, “for attention, I guess.” “I wanted to make a statement,” he said. “Sex isn’t a bad thing. Sex can be fun.”Pasquale originally envisioned his magazine as “a Playboy for Harvard”. He said he chose not to join the existing campus magazine on sexuality, H-Bomb, because he wanted to make a magazine that was less artistic. H Bomb, on the other hand, has another purpose. “It was intended for the enjoyment of undergraduates,” Hrdy said. “I think we had a purpose to push social boundaries to some extent.”Co-founder Katharina P. Cieplak-von Baldegg ’06 said the creation of the magazine was driven by the importance of having a conversation about sex and sexuality on campus. “We wanted to cover every kind of context,” she said, “Whether it was social or artistic or biological.”Harvard students and alumni have confronted different responses to the work they have done in erotica.“It was interesting to see how it didn’t really matter to a lot of people,” Di Pasquale remarked. “A lot of people didn’t care.”As for H Bomb, “I think some of the boys were upset that it wasn’t more erotic,” said Hrdy of its first publication. “I heard some say that there weren’t enough raunchy photos… But you know, our mothers really liked it.”Bezreh said that the reactions to her first film were, in general, not what she was looking for. “I had a lot of really high concept, theoretical ideas about what I wanted to say and what I wanted that gesture to mean,” Bezreh said. “I got a lot of fan mail, ‘Oh your movie was really fun and hot.’… I wasn’t very interested in that.”Her second film elicited reactions that were more in tune with Bezreh’s intentions. Speaking of her fans, she said, “They responded from a vulnerable place instead of from a sexual place.” Bezreh said that she intends to continue making art in the erotic arena. Hrdy and Cieplak-von Baldegg have, since H Bomb, left erotica behind them.Cieplak-von Baldegg, who went to work for Current TV after Harvard, said that her work there continued addressing relationships and sex. She credits her involvement with H Bomb in helping to secure her job with Current, where she has worked with other Harvard alumni, including Kyle A. Gilman ’02, creator of the 2008 documentary “Awkward Webcam Sex”. The film chronicles the webcam interactions of his fictional long-distance relationship, and the reactions of people when he posted the clips. Hrdy is now in law school, and said that she doubts she will have enough time to ever get involved in something like H Bomb again. Yet she did not dismiss the possibility. “If the law market goes down,” she said laughing. “I’m going back into the erotic industry.”As for Harvard students who contemplate deviating from the expected “Harvard path,” Cieplak-von Baldegg encourages them to pursue their original ideas. “It’s what [you’ve] worked on and… produced that people are going to be interested in,” she said.Bezreh’s advice was more cautious. “I think that pornography/erotica is the medium, and it really depends on what you’re saying,” she said. “You could have the most misguided reasons for being involved with it or you could have almost the most beautiful reasons for being a part of it.”“I don’t mean to be the voice of caution,” said Bezreh. “But I think the stigma is real.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven years ago, Paul Harding was just starting out as an Expos preceptor. At nights he would teach fiction writing at the Harvard Extension School, then go home and help take care of his newborn son. “Once I had kids, I realized how much free time I used to have,” Harding says. “It was a kick in the ass; I couldn’t be precious about writing.” Over the next three years he would juggle his careers as educator and father, while completing his first major published work.Harding’s debut novel, “Tinkers,” published this past January, was the product of various scraps of writing—from a 4x6 notebook to Post-It notes and scratch paper. Harding refers to this haphazard production strategy as “guerrilla writing.”“I learned to drop right into the mental space,” he says. “When I had two free minutes, I would write. When I’m doing dishes, I would think about what to write.”Time pressures exist for every creative writer at Harvard, from the professional to the ambitious student, and those writers have learned to cope in different ways.“Writing takes a lot of mental energy,” says Shoshanna L. Fine ’10, one of few students accepted to write a creative thesis. “I’m fortunate that there is a creative track in the English department that allows me to prioritize writing.”Fine, now in her third fiction workshop with Senior Lecturer Bret A. Johnston, acknowledges that the formal deadlines of a workshop are helpful in sustaining her writing. “There is so much going on that I can’t find time to do things if there isn’t a school pressure,” she says. “I would probably not be a writer if I were not writing a thesis and taking these courses.”Others see creative writing as a complementary endeavor to their academic studies. Angelo S. Mao ’10 is an Engineering concentrator who plans to pursue a career in that field. On the side, however, Mao has written around 20 short stories, a novel, and 50 poems, and he has taken three creative writing workshops.“I like to think that it didn’t hurt my grades, because it fulfilled some spiritual or psychological need that helped me do better in classes,” says Mao, smiling. “At least that’s what I tell myself.”Fiction writers are especially affected by the pressure on Harvard students to use their degrees for a high-powered career. The publishing industry is infamously difficult to break into, and success is far from guaranteed. “A writer is a hard thing to become,” Fine says. “I’m not sure—maybe [I’ll write] at some point, but not immediately after college. Maybe.”Mao also feels an obligation to stay in the sciences—a pressure he partly attributes to his upbringing. “I see a career in engineering as more productive,” he says. He expresses discomfort at having to compromise his writing to satisfy the industry. “Writing professionally means you have to deal with being a popular writer. I hold myself to a higher standard.” At the same time, Mao wouldn’t be happy being “just a scientist,” saying that he will continue to write on the side.And in addition to balancing other interests and personal integrity, there is also the issue of paying the bills. Harding, who now teaches only at the Extension School, puts the financial matter bluntly. “If you’re going to be a fiction writer you have to understand that you’re not going to make any money out of it,” he says. “You need to assume a profession to get the paycheck.”DON’T ASK, DON’T TELLEric D. Bennett ’97 has a scholarly air about him. He speaks slowly and chooses his words carefully, as a fiction writer might.“It takes audacity to declare yourself as a fiction writer, especially with no prior publication,” the Pforhzheimer House tutor says. As an undergraduate, Bennett attended Deep Springs College and finished his B.A. in English at Harvard University. He received his Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) from the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop and is earning his Ph.D. in English at Harvard this year. His dissertation is on the rise of creative writing programs after World War II. He is currently working on his second novel.“Writing fiction while doing a graduate degree in English is probably something like being gay in the Army,” Bennett says. “Half your colleagues are titillated by the same thing as you. But it doesn’t mean they want you to talk about it.” That might explain the fact that while there are many writers among Cambridge’s literati, Bennett feels the writing scene can be surprisingly hush-hush.According to Bennett, the relative silence of the writing community stems from a combination of individual pride and the English Department’s notoriously critical approach. Bennett perceives this as having an indirectly positive effect. “The English Department discourages writing on the side, but not explicitly,” Bennett says. “Those who take writing seriously learn it’s best to do it on one’s own.”Despite holding an MFA, Bennett is lukewarm about creative writing programs. “MFA programs seem unrelated to excellent writing...Writing programs are gratifying, but there should be no inflated expectations about how one will advance a career,” he says. “Workshops should probably be regarded as personal, not professional opportunities.” Still, Harvard offers a wide array of avenues for a writer. “Harvard is full of great ideas and people,” Bennett says. For aspiring writers, he recommends concentrating in “something other than creative writing to gain an idea of another field, which would improve you as a writer.” Bennett also argues against the idea of establishing an MFA program at Harvard, pointing out that Harvard’s undergraduate program produces enough great writers on its own. “If you look at a list of Advocate alums, it compares remarkably well to graduate programs in writing like the one at Iowa,” Bennett says, referring to the Harvard literary publication of which he was also a member. “Harvard recognizes this, and they know a Bachelor’s is enough.” Much of creative writing’s inconspicuousness has to do with its being a solitary pursuit, which is often integral to its appeal. But for those who seek it, a fiction community exists both within Harvard and the Cambridge area.Apart from undergraduate publications like the Harvard Advocate and Tuesday Magazine, the Dudley House Review provides a more graduate student-friendly space for writers to come together in workshops and in print.Rita Banerjee, a graduate student in Comparative Literature, has lived in New Jersey and Washington and calls the Cambridge creative community particularly strong.“Graduate students and undergraduates are very dedicated to the craft, which is often of a MFA quality or better, and students respect their peers,” she says. “It’s really nice to have a sense of community—it gives you a sense of the aesthetics you believe in.”When she is not working on her newest manuscript of poems, Banerjee is an editor at the Dudley Review and also participates in the Cambridge Writers’ workshop. Unlike Bennett, she advocates expanding the fiction community on campus.“Harvard would do well to get more outlets for its writers, [more places] for students to showcase their works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Paper is everywhere. Manila folders burst out of shelves in the publicity hallway, overflowing with press releases and reviews for past titles. Books fill the offices of the small three-story building. Clothbound volumes decades old press up against colorful editions published this year. Jacket covers hang on the walls in lieu of pictures.These people love books. Welcome to the Harvard University Press.Founded in 1913, the Harvard University Press is one of the nation’s most renowned university presses. Its collection of scholarly books, as well as the Loeb Classical Library and I Tatti Renaissance Library, have earned the Press a coveted place among academic publishers. “Yesterday, we had a visit from people at the King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. They wanted to know our secret,” Editor-in-Chief Michael G. Fisher ’73 says. As the publishing industry struggles to adapt to changing readership, Press employees hope that the “secret” to their success—as they see it, conscientious editing—will sustain them in the future.This editorial process has made the Press’s name. “[It] embodies one of the great editorial traditions of scholarly publishing in this country or anywhere else,” says Peter J. Dougherty, Director of the Princeton University Press.FIRST IMPRESSIONSThe Press publishes about 200 manuscripts a year. Standards are high. Representatives of the press often scour academic conventions for the newest and freshest ideas. The nine acquisition editors follow scholars whose work might one day prove promising. Each is an expert in his or her field. “We’re lapsed academics,” says Elizabeth Knoll, an acquisition editor for Behavior Sciences, Education and Law. Just like getting into Harvard itself, getting one’s work into the Press is a struggle. “I had had a professional dream of publishing with them for years. I had to convince them that they should publish me,” Dr. Mark S. Micale says. Micale, a History professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, ultimately succeeded. The Press published his most recent book on medical history, “Hysterical Men,” last fall.Obtaining the rights to publish a book is only the beginning of an extended process. Authors keep in constant contact with their editors, as they send in chapters and discuss ideas.“They helped me present my material so that it would maximize its interest and reach beyond just other academic specialists,” Micale explains.Manuscript editors then go through the draft to improve the quality of the prose. Before it can be printed, the manuscript must also be reviewed anonymously by two other experts in the field. Then the book, vetted and designed, can finally be sent out to the outside companies that compose and print the final product. Over the course of the process, Knoll says, “We shape, curate, and disseminate information.”new face of booksWhile this review process has made the Press’ name, staff members are always looking for new ways to make their books more relevant to the modern reader. For example, catchy design can make a scholarly work more accessible. Recently, the Press reissued the John Harvard Library, a series of American writings originally printed in the 1970s. Stormy blue-grey portraits of individual authors appear on the covers of each edition. The portraits, by contemporary artist Robert Carter, add energy to the old writings. “It gives a new feeling to these figures that people have just seen in dusty gilded frames and old galleries,” Carter says about his work. Fisher agrees. “Have you ever seen an issue of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ that looked so readable?” he asks.And following trends that are emerging in the rest of the industry, the Press has moved to the Internet to encourage potential readers to return to books. The Press now has a blog and a Facebook.com page. Traffic is still minimal: the blog averages about 200 hits a day. Harvard University Press’ Twitter.com has over 1200 followers; Yale’s has over 1600. Blog posts and tweets announce information pertaining to everything from restaurant shout-outs to news stories—be they about publishing or another, totally unrelated subject. “It’s a good way to get the news out quickly and informally,” Senior Publicist Andrew Battle says. He’s wearing a green shirt stamped with the seal of the Loeb Classical Library, except that the seated Athena holds a beer. The back reads, “Homer, 82.” “It’s the shirt for  the Press softball team,” Battle explains. The Press is looking toward the future—they have to be. Sales are down across the publishing industry. “There was once the post-Gutenberg generation. Now we are dealing with the post-Google generation,” says Sharmilla Sen ’92, an acquisition editor for the Humanities. Still, the editors are confident that the services they provide to academia and readers at large will not become obsolete. “We perform a scholarly function—it’s eminently transportable to other media,” Knoll says. They hope that while information-gathering is changing, the book will remain relevant. “In 20 years, there’s still going to be paper in this office,” says Knoll.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tucked between Eliot House and the University Lutheran Church, the modest two-story building on 21 South Street is an apt architectural metaphor for the organization it houses. The headquarters of the Harvard Advocate is more picturesque than pretentious, and save for a crest on the building’s facade, the quaint white siding and green window frames belie the literary clout that lies within.Though the humble exterior may do well to conceal the presence of the country’s oldest continuously published college literary magazine, the interior tells a different story. The Advocate’s past literally envelops the space: the walls of the Sanctum are lined with rows of wooden plaques dating back to 1872. Names written in gold commemorate board members of each guard, the letters fading away with each older plate. To peruse these plaques along the perimeter of the room is to travel back in time through a chronicle of Harvard luminaries—L. Grossman, J. Atlas, T. S. Eliot, J. Ashbery, T. Roosevelt. History’s presence is ubiquitous in the Advocate, suspended over every aspect of the publication. Bookshelves sag with yellowing issues, and century-old, sepia-toned photographs of all-male editors hang above the fireplace, observing—from a bygone era—the activities of the publication today. This balance between revering history and promoting the avant-garde is what distinguishes the Advocate from other literary magazines and allows it to seek out the most innovative content.A RICH HISTORY Founded in 1866 by Charles S. Gage and William G. Peckham, both class of 1867, the Advocate rose from the ashes of the Collegian, an earlier Harvard newspaper that had been shut down by university administrators following an attack on mandatory chapel attendance. Originally published in newspaper format, the Advocate was Harvard’s sole publication until The Crimson was founded in 1873. Three years later, some members of the Advocate left to form the Lampoon, and by the 1880s, the publication was exclusively devoted to essays, fiction, and poetry written and submitted by undergraduates.Today, the Advocate, published quarterly, is composed of four content boards: poetry, fiction, features, and art. Their mission statement is simple—“The Harvard Advocate is concerned with supporting literature and the Arts on campus”—remaining largely unchanged for over a century. DULCE EST PERICULUM Despite constant reminders of the past, members say that the Advocate’s history neither defines nor restricts the organization.Adopting the Collegian’s motto of “Dulce est Periculum” or “Danger is Sweet,” the publication has transgressed boundaries since its inception, for example, advocating coeducation at Harvard when the notion still remained radical. Members say that rather than obliging the magazine to conform to tradition, the Advocate’s history actually allows it to push forward and serves as a “springboard, not a shackle,” according to documents from the Advocate’s archives.“There’s always been a tendency towards experimentation,” says Evan L. Hanlon ’08, a former Advocate art editor. “That willingness to push the envelope or touch the borders of what’s okay is still definitely alive.” Unquestionably, some of the Advocate’s most notable alumni have been the most iconoclastic. Hanlon cites past “Advokats” Norman K. Mailer ’43, Frank O’Hara ’50, and John L. Ashbery ’49 as writers who followed their own ideas about writing rather than obeying the status quo, a central tenet of the Advocate’s philosophy. MAKING HISTORY To this day, Advocate editors say they strive to feature content that they themselves admire, as opposed to simply chosing pieces that may be the most commercially successful or popular. The rich history of the Advocate, rather than engendering a conflict between the old and the new, actually contributes to its ability to find groundbreaking work.  The Advocate attracts a large quantity of submissions for each issue, allowing editors to cull pieces of the highest quality. “We’re not running around desperate for content. We can be selective and get things that are really good and really new,” says design board member Joseph B. Morcos ’12, contrasting the Advocate with younger and less prominent publications on campus. “Our history actually contributes to the magazine’s ability to find ahead-of-the-curve things.” The history of the Advocate is also a source of certain privileges. For instance, the cover of the Fall 2008 Archives issue depicted collages by John Ashbery, a former Advocate editor. “No other magazine would be able to get the rights to those collages,” says Morcos. “But we can fall back on our history.” ON THE SAME PAGEA shared pride in Advocate history binds former members to the organization, even decades after their involvement as undergraduates. Louis H. Begley ’54, the critically-acclaimed author, was a member of the fiction board while at Harvard and is currently the Chairman Emeritus of the Advocate’s Board of Trustees. In 2000, an annual prize was established in his honor for the best fiction piece published in the magazine.  “The Advocate was very much at the center of my Harvard experience,” says Begley. “It was my home, if you like.” Begley describes long nights spent laying out the magazine by hand, cutting and pasting stories without the help of computers, and debating about literature. “Writing is a solitary business, but you have a desire for an audience,” Begley says, comparing the Advocate to a sanctuary for students who care about writing and the arts. “Creative writing classes fulfill that to a degree, but the Advocate gives budding writers a certain autonomy and companionship.” The support and fellowship that young writers and artists find at the Advocate is one that members say they most appreciate about their involvement—surpassing even the writing or artistic experiences they gained. Peter C. Nohrnberg ’93 and Stephen L. Burt ’93, current associate professors of English at Harvard, were both editors of the Advocate during undergraduate years, their present careers testifying to the role the magazine has played in nurturing and developing literary and artistic talent. “I remain grateful to the Advocate,” says Burt, “for providing me with a serious literary community where students could read the work of other students and discuss contemporary literature.” Douglas Mao ’87, currently an English professor at John Hopkins University, credits the Advocate for encouraging his then-nascent interest in literature. Though he concentrated in biology at Harvard, he realized during his junior year that his true calling was English, not medicine. After his work was accepted and published by the Advocate, Mao describes feeling encouraged. “The Advocate helped me feel where my heart was going,” he says.THE ADVOCATE TODAY Clad in a wrinkled button-down shirt and worn sweatshirt, Advocate President Sanders I. Bernstein ’10, a former Crimson Arts executive, looks the picture of a romanticized poet. With an unruly tangle of hair and dark circles under his eyes, he seems as if he hasn’t slept in three days, and rightly so: for the past week, Bernstein has basically lived at the Advocate in order to finalize the spring issue. “I have a pretty auxiliary position, really,” Bernstein says of his role as President. “I just make sure everything extraneous to the creation of magazine is dealt with.”  He still recalls vividly the first time he ever stepped into the building as a terrified freshman for the introductory comp meeting. “There were clouds of smoke, glasses of red wine, people laughing at little jokes one of them would tell,” says Bernstein. “It was scary and just really bizarre, and I remember just sitting there on the floor, keeping my head down.” Despite an intimidating first impression, Bernstein is now undeniably at ease at the Advocate, which he describes as a home away from home. “It’s really come to feel like a community,” Bernstein says.  Fittingly, “home” is a term often used by Advokats both past and present to describe the organization that  weaves tradition with innovation, and history with the present.

Studying fiction at Harvard has several prerequisites: a love of reading; a love of writing; a love of deep, introspective conversations about context and syntax over a steaming latte; and, of course, a love of frenzied highlighting of key passages in the wee hours of the night. Here’s a rundown of the fiction concentrations—see how well you match up.EnglishTrust the popular consensus? With over 250 concentrators in 2007, the English department is proven to be one of the most popular places to study fiction—and with good reason. Students have considerable flexibility in carving out their focus, with the ability to take a class on virtually any time period and focus on a myriad of authors. If you’re interested in stretching your creative legs, test your skills in anything from playwriting to poetry to science fiction. If you enjoy interacting with well-known authors and opportunities to schmooze with faculty members, then the “Writers in the Parlor” series and “Tea Stop” gatherings are just what you’ve been looking for. A recent curricular change replaced old requirements with four common ground requirements in the area of Arrivals, Diffusions, Poets, and Shakespeares. But don’t fret: you can still take the new iterations of Major British Writers I and II if you want to. Apart from academic demand, the department’s rich offerings do come with an added pressure: you have to look good while doing it. English concentrators usually dress the part—look no further than the plethora of glittery scarves that adorn the inhabitants of the Barker Center Café—and exude a certain je ne sais quoi that suggests that they just might be better read than you are. Judging by the concentration requirements, they probably are.History and LiteratureContext. Context. Context. But most importantly: context. As a Hist & Lit concentrator you’d better have a deep appreciation for the who, what, when, where, and why of what you’re reading. One of the great things about the concentration is that it allows you to sample many extra-departmental courses and count them for concentration credit. As the oldest Harvard concentration, Hist & Lit tends to kick it old school, with a heavy emphasis on tutorials, small classes, and personal attention for concentrators. A less fortunate aspect of the old school method: lots of hard work. An application is required to enter the concentration; other requisites include an oral exam at the end of sophomore and senior year, a junior research essay, and a student bibliography of studied texts to be prepared at the end of sophomore, junior, and senior year.If you enjoy some adventure in your life, you’ll like the fact that Hist & Lit has a large degree of flexibility in designing an individual plan of study. The concentration requires you to select a special field within the concentration with a focus on America, Latin America, Modern Europe, Postcolonial Studies, Early Modern Europe, Medieval Europe, or a field of your choice—pending tutor approval. In short, a Hist & Lit concentrator has to endure a fair amount of paperwork, but for someone interested in planning out a specialized field of study, the extra work is well worth it. LiteratureAre you trilingual? Do you harbor a special love for all incarnations of the story of 1001 Nights? Do you consider the writings of Copernicus, the poetry of Apollinaire, the philosophical musings of Aristotle, and the narratives of Tolstoy to have equally great literary value? If so, you’ll feel right at home in the Lit concentration. It may be a smaller concentration than its peers, with about 50 concentrators in 2007, but like the other fiction concentrations it allows students to construct their own specialized field of inquiry. The emphasis in the Lit department is on cross-cultural comparisons, so either come in with some foreign language skills or be prepared to learn some. Along with its Hist & Lit, its cousin concentration, Lit has a foreign literature requirement and encourages concentrators to study abroad for a semester—so you’ll probably leave Harvard worldlier than you came. Lit concentrators work throughout their college careers to answer the question, “What is literature?” Lit’s flexibility allows concentrators to explore the fields of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Visual and Environmental Studies in pursuit of an answer. If you enjoy debating the merits of spoken versus written word, or if you’ve got that well-traveled, inquisitive, and black-turtleneck-with-black-jeans-with-black-shoes-with-dark-rimmed-glasses look about you, Lit is where you belong.

While undergraduates at the College and students at the Extension School don’t tend to mingle much, just take a look at both course catalogues, and you’ll find some striking parallels. With 13 creative writing course listings at the Extension School, the opportunity for student diversity is great. But as for the courses themselves, at least on paper, they look a whole lot like what undergraduates are used to at the College. The creative writing offerings provided by both institutions are nearly identical, and many members of the creative writing faculty at the Extension School are in fact part of the College’s Expository Writing program.REQUIRED WRITINGJust as all undergraduates at the College must take Expository Writing, Expos is also a requirement for the Extension School degree program. “The fiction and expository writing classes are great complements,” said Dr. William Weitzel, an Expository Writing preceptor at the College and the instructor for the Extension School’s Intermediate Fiction Writing course. Indeed, many of his creative writing colleagues at the Extension School share a similar pedigree—splitting their time between their responsibilities at the Extension School and Expository Writing program at the College. Like Weitzel, Dr. Ken Urban, a professional playwright and director, is an instructor of playwriting at the Extension School who also teaches Expository Writing to undergraduates.Before enrolling in Urban’s playwriting class, Chris Hayes, a student at the Extension School, was required to take Expository Writing to fulfill his degree requirements. He explains that although he was one of the few students that enjoyed his Expository Writing class, the course was among his most positive academic experiences thus far. “Any time you learn a new style of writing, you are exercising your writing muscle, “ Hayes said. “Professor Morrison, my expository writing professor, was fantastic, and although the course itself was stressful, I was able to add to my toolbox and think critically and analytically.”CREATIVELY WORKINGLike the College’s English Department, the Extension School’s creative writing program covers a wide range of genres—from playwriting and memoir to novels. For students like Hayes who are seeking to develop their writing, the range of courses provides ample space for exploration. Hayes, who is specially interested in screenwriting, is currently enrolled in Urban’s playwriting class. After taking a screenwriting class last year, he decided that this would help enhance his writing. The course is designed for students with little or no experience in writing plays. Assignments consist of drafting small dialogues or monologues, while the class culminates in students writing ten-minute long scripts. “What’s neat about [this course] is that after we do our assignments, they all get read in class, and then everyone makes comments in a very structured way,” Hayes said. “You really feel the pressure of a real playwright, because if your work stinks it could be really embarrassing. It forces you to think of it in a realistic environment.”Like Urban, other faculty members at the Extension School bring their own professional, real-life experience to the classroom. Christopher S. Mooney, who teaches a course on suspense fiction, is a published author of suspense novels. Robin Lippincott, who leads a section of Intermediate Fiction Writing, has written three novels and a collection of short stories. Lippincott believes that to become a good fiction writer, one must think like one. It is this mentality that informs his teaching. “For the first few weeks of the class, I bring in published stories for the students to read and study,” said Lippincott. “This teaches them to read like a writer and thus helps them to learn elements of fictional technique.”The Extension School also features a course titled “Writing the Novel,” which is taught by William J. Holinger, a former Expository Writing preceptor and current director of the Harvard Summer School Secondary School Program. Holinger has been teaching this course for over a decade, although this year he revamped it to present the material in a different way—emphasizing point of view, voice, and narration, as well as narrative structure and plot. Holinger says that he devotes a lot of time in this course to focusing on the students’ own work and discussing the process behind writing a novel. According to Holinger, “Writing a novel is a huge enterprise. Everyone does it differently, and so we discuss process in just about every class.”In addition, Holinger also invites a novelist to speak to his students every semester. For the past several years, this visitor has been a former student of the class.THE STORIES BEHIND THE STUDENTSOne of the defining characteristics of the Extension School courses is the great diversity of the students who take them. Although most of the creative writing courses are capped at fifteen students, participants hail from unique backgrounds, and represent a wide range of ages. One student in Holinger’s class actually flies in every week from Georgia to take his course at the Extension School. Holinger adds that while the Extension School officially caps its creative writing courses at 15 students, he tends to admit more than that “because life intervenes, and students’ lives change: they move away unexpectedly, they change jobs, they have a baby—whatever.” When he’s selecting students for his classes, Hollinger explains that he tries to ignore their ages and focus on their novels. This term, his class consists of 17 students—most of whom are in their 20’s and 30’s, although some are in their 50’s and older. According to Lippincott, the students in his course are equally varied. Represented in his Intermediate Fiction Writing course are Harvard undergraduates, recent college graduates, as well as professionals—including lawyers and journalists. Weitzel believes that this diversity is what makes his class enjoyable for his students as well as for him. “I really enjoy teaching fiction in the Extension School,” he said. “A wide range of students enroll who bring with them a great deal of enthusiasm and determination. Their excitement is infectious.”

“Always write with a compass but not a map,” says Ceridwen Dovey ’03, quoting the contemporary Spanish author Javier Marias to describe the way she approaches writing. Dovey’s first novel, “Blood Kin,” follows the paths of three members of a presidential staff in a nameless country. “Blood Kin” was published in 2007, and since then, Dovey’s debut novel has accumulated a growing catalog of literary prizes and sparkling reviews. In many ways, the author’s own path has matched her approach to writing.Though published at first only in South Africa, the novel boasted a blurb by Nobel Prize winning South African novelist J. M. Coetzee, and quickly began receiving attention. Dovey, whose mother had written one of the first scholarly treatments of Coetzee’s work, called it a “miracle.” Since then, the book has been met with widespread acclaim, and has been published or is awaiting publication in 17 countries.Dovey’s literary success story is an unlikely one. She recalls feeling “sort of blown away” in her undergraduate years by the “Harvard idea of, ‘do what you love.’” At Harvard, she studied Anthropology and Visual and Environmental Studies, completing a documentary on South African wine farms for her thesis. “I wanted to make documentaries,” she said. “I didn’t take creative writing at all... I did take English 10a freshman year and that put me off English.” After working for the public television documentary program, “NOW with Bill Moyers,” Dovey moved back to South Africa. Dovey found that the resources in Cape Town, however, couldn’t stack up to Harvard’s well-stocked VES department. Out of what she calls “desperation” for creative outlet, Dovey enrolled in a Master of Fine Arts program at the University of Cape Town, where she wrote “Blood Kin” as her master’s thesis. The novel follows the barber, chef, and portraitist of a presidential household in an African country as they are taken hostage during a military coup.The novel strives to be emotional and intellectual, but the writer says “Blood Kin” intentionally strayed from the personal. “I wanted to avoid the trap of the debut novel, of narcissistically rewriting your own childhood,” Dovey says. “I didn’t want to be seen as ethnic literature or female literature.”And despite her success, Dovey hasn’t surrendered her other interests to the pen. She is currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program in Anthropology at New York University, where she is working on issues of climate change.But Dovey’s paths aren’t completely separate: she is working on another novel that is inspired by her work in anthropology. “It’s really only in the writing itself that ideas come,” Dovey says, giving words to a sentiment that feels as familiar and universal as Expos. “If I plan it out too much, then I don’t want to write.” For now, at least, Dovey is following her own compass.

The work of Arch C. Whitehead ’91 (better known as Colson Whitehead) has been invariably compared to Ralph Ellison’s masterpiece, “The Invisible Man.” He’s garnered plaudits of all kinds: a MacArthur Genius grant at age 32, Pulitzer finalist status for his novel “John Henry Days,” and a myriad of awards for young authors, including the Young Lions Fiction Award, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, and a Whiting Writers Award. However, for all the attention paid to him within the world of letters, here at Harvard, he might as well be the man Ralph Ellison’s title refers to. As a Harvard undergraduate, Whitehead did not call attention to himself. As he admitted to the Crimson in 2003, he  “didn’t say anything.” Though he completed his coursework, he was not an exceptional student nor was he a central player in the publication scene on campus, eschewing the traditional incubatory institutions for a would-be-writer, opting not to take part in John H. Updike ’54’s Lampoon, David L. Halberstam ’55’s Crimson, or Norman K. Mailer ’43’s Advocate.  It was when he was eight years out, in 1999, after a stint as a critic at the Village Voice, that Whitehead began to make noise with the release of his first novel, “The Intuitionist,” which follows a black, female elevator inspector during a time of racial integration. Cameron Leader-Picone, a graduate student in the African-American Studies Department whose dissertation includes a chapter on Whitehead, says, “‘The Intuitionist’ was really big coming out of the gate. It became a major novel immediately. I had him assigned in two of my classes [as an undergraduate at Yale].” Whitehead has become a powerful voice in the literary world, participating in critical literary discourse, along with producing creative works. His novels “John Henry Days” (2001), a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and “Apex Hides the Hurt” (2006) have been highly lauded for Whitehead’s comedic command of language and his ability to create interesting conceits that explore race in a post-racial world. Leader-Picone says, “I think the African-American literary tradition is incredibly rich and I think that he moves it forward while also drawing deeply from it.” Recently, he even took shots at Professor of English James Wood, harnessing his comedic touch in a vicious parody of Wood’s “How Fiction Works.” The article, “Wow Fiction Works!,” which appeared in Harper’s Magazine in February, attacked the perceived snobbery of Wood’s approach to literature, the arrogance of  Wood’s crypto-normative approach. Whitehead assumed the voice of a pompous literary quack to make his point, “I have essayed to instruct your writers in how to write correctly. Now I will teach you to read correctly.” He himself has not been immune to criticism, however. His novels have been faulted for their refusal to directly confront issues of race head-on and the page-turning power of his plots have been called into question by more than one reviewer. Leader-Picone answers Whitehead’s detractors. “I think he is more focused on the politics of aesthetics. He is not political in the way African-American writers of the 1960’s were political,” Leader-Picone says. “And he is not unique in that.”And yet, despite Whitehead’s stature, in the last ten years he has come to speak at Harvard only once, as part of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute’s “Black Writers Reading” series in 2002. Though his work is taught on campus—Professor Henry Louis Gates’s English 276x, a graduate seminar on the African American Literary Tradition, features “The Intuitionist” on its syllabus—he is not present in any real way in the ethos of the school. Unlike past authors of some note, perhaps Mailer being the most Harvard-bound, his connection to the institution seems tenuous at best. In interviews, he rarely mentions his Harvard years.Later this month, Whitehead will embark on a tour to promote his new novel, “Sag Harbor,” an excerpt of which appeared in The New Yorker’s Winter Fiction Issue. Last time he was in town, in 2006, he drew a crowd of 75 people to the Brattle Theatre, according to Heather Gain of Harvard Book Store. This time when he is in Boston, he will read at Porter Square Books on May 7. When asked about the reading, Ellen Jarrett, who is in charge of organizing events for the bookstore, says, “I am very hopeful for a good event...His first book was very popular. And based upon the popularity of his piece in The New Yorker, it should be a good event.”

Vasugi V. Ganeshananthan ’02 never dreamed of being a rock star, an astronaut, or a firefighter. While other kids were still picking their noses, Ganeshananthan was already thinking about fiction.  When Ganeshananthan entered Harvard in the fall of ’98, she already knew she wanted to be a writer. This knowledged helped focus her academic career.  “I wanted to write a creative thesis and the only way I could do that was in English, so I knew I wanted to be an English major and get certain grades,” she says. Under the guidance of Professor Jamaica Kincaid, Ganeshananthan completed her creative thesis. Seven years and about 150 pages later, she turned it into her first novel, “Love Marriage.”Before her career in fiction took off, however, Ganeshananthan became editor of her high school newspaper, and after enrolling at Harvard, she jumped right into The Crimson, rising to one of the top positions as Managing Editor. While Ganeshananthan always intended to become a novelist, her tireless work at the Crimson helped improve her editing skills. “I knew that I wanted to be a fiction writer long before having any interest in journalism,” she says. “Journalism helped me to not be particularly touchy about [editing], because if it turns out better, then I’m the winner in the end.” Prone to early starts, Ganeshananthan began conceptualizing the story that would become her senior thesis as soon as she arrived on campus.   “She actually essentially started her thesis freshmen year...it was something she’d had in mind for a long time,” says Emily J. Halpern ’02-03, Ganeshananthan’s college roommate. Yet come senior year, she was still making changes. “Sugi had more sleepless nights than anyone else I remember,” Halpern says.   As Ganeshananthan’s thesis advisor, Kincaid remembers a different aspect of her thesis process. “She’s a good writer; I was just sort of standing by,” Kincaid says. “You read, you make suggestions, and you correct, but in the end, it’s hers.”  After graduating from Harvard, Ganeshananthan went on to work at The Atlantic Monthly, returning to her budding novel after work each night. She then went on to graduate with an Masters of Fine Arts in fiction from the Iowa Writer’s Workshop, where she received more feedback on her novel. Ganeshananthan continued to work with her editor and old friend, Rebecca Shapiro, and by its publication in 2008, the story had been transformed. “It was very, very different,” she says. One of the main characters in “Love Marriage,” the protagonist’s uncle, didn’t even appear in her thesis.“I thought her thesis was wonderful and then I thought her book was wonderful,” Kincaid says, “but she grew as a writer and what she did in the book she couldn’t have done as a student.”Ganeshananthan continues to develop her career, planning to begin a new job as Visiting Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Michigan in the fall and working on her second novel. “It will probably have some similar themes and concerns,” shey says, “but, again, I’m sort of just focusing on the getting actual machinery of the story working.”

Jamaica Kincaid sees writing as an “accompaniment” to the rest of one’s life.“You can do anything and still be devoted to writing,” the visiting lecturer in English says. Her thesis advisee Uzodinma C. Iweala ’04 is living proof of that belief—Iweala’s creative senior thesis was published as the well-received novel “Beasts of No Nation.” And if writing a novel during college isn’t impressive enough, he did it all while fulfilling his pre-med requirements.As a freshman, Iweala planned to concentrate in economics. But after some time in his first Economics 10 lecture, a thoroughly bored Iweala walked out to catch the last 20 minutes of another course on his shopping list. It was led by English Professor Steven Greenblatt. Iweala had no idea who the renowned theorist and Shakespeare scholar was, but the way he talked about Chaucer made it “seem like the most incredible thing to read on the earth.” Iweala was hooked. After switching to English, Iweala stuck it out as a pre-med to fulfill a desire to study something “practical.” Doing so meant a heavy workload, but writing a creative thesis let him focus on something he loved. “My last year at Harvard made going to Harvard really, really worth it, which corresponded to writing a thesis,” Iweala says.During his junior year, Iweala had had the chance to meet former child soldier China Keitetsi when she came to give a talk to the Harvard African Students Association. While Iweala had already written a rough short story about a child soldier, Keitetsi inspired him to write something larger in scope. Iweala decided to set his novel in a fictional country in West Africa, but he felt that he had to understand the world of a child soldier before he could begin writing. He began reading texts on the subject and interviews with former child soldiers, as well as talking to survivors of the Nigerian Civil War of the 1960s.“You can’t write about it unless you know the rules and regulations of the world you are creating,” Iweala says. Writing his thesis wasn’t any less of an uphill battle once his research was done. Professor Kincaid gave Iweala the key to her office so that he could write whenever he wished. Iweala remembers spending many nights on the floor of the office, writing and rewriting. One of the most difficult things about the story was finding its voice. “He’s very interested in the voices we speak with and the voices we have in our own head,” says Ian R. MacKenzie ’04, Iweala’s friend and fellow thesis-writer. “Beasts of No Nation” is written in a vernacular inspired by the Nigerian English Iweala had heard during his summers in Nigeria. “He took a long time to find that voice,” MacKenzie says. “But once he found it, he knew he found something that was really special.”Kincaid found the thesis exceptional enough to send it to her agent. HarperCollins then picked it up and published it in 2005. But according to Iweala, having this early success hasn’t made his career choice any more clear.“I remember walking into a bookstore and seeing it and thinking, ‘What do I do now?’” he says. Currently a student at Columbia University Medical School, the 26-year-old works on a book about HIV/AIDS in between classes and writes stories on his BlackBerry while on the train. Although he is still unsure about being a doctor, Kincaid, at least, is sure about one thing: “He will still write.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I wake up I can tell that I’m on the third or fourth floor of a big house, not an entirely unfamiliar one, but one that I’ve been in two, maybe even three times before.I can tell that I’m the first, the only one, awake. It’s not so familiar that I don’t have to look for the bathroom, so I shuffle around in the thick shag carpeting until I find it, behind a crudely painted white door that hangs ajar amidst winter sunlight. It’s a tiny attic bathroom with a sharp eave descending over the toilet so I have to hunch to stand under it and squint at the sharp light reflecting off the snow on the roof, through the diagonal glass panes of the window. It hurts so much that I lean my head against this sharp eave for five minutes, to steady myself. Trying again to look out the window, I squint so hard that I can’t tell if it’s actually snowing or just really snowy, and how much of the whiteness is just sun.All I remember from last night is brushing my teeth in this bathroom for a full hour, molars jagged with chewed-up Doritos, and four or five other guys all huddled around too, slumped in the three-part corners where two walls meet the floor. We’d talked about the fathomless ocean of history in sentences that ranged from two to a hundred words long.Then we must have dispersed. Waking up on a couch with a sweatshirt wrapped around my feet and my undershirt bunched up under my head, I know better than to go poking around the house, knocking on closed doors, asking where everyone is. It must be eleven in the morning, hardly time for any of that on a winter Sunday in Senior Year. I wish I had some pajamas or a bathrobe, but I just pull on my old jeans and sweatshirt, a little damp from gin and sweat.I seem to have this part of the attic mostly to myself. There are a few cast-off sneakers and pocketbooks strewn across the floor, but no sounds of anyone breathing. After looking at the snowy pines, whose tops are about level with the windows on this floor, I swig some mouthwash, spit it out, and climb another half flight of stairs, into what looks like a guest room or spare den. There’s another old couch in this room, an even older one, and a dusty TV on a stand, a jumble of videotapes and a Sega Genesis in a pile under it, halfway boxed-up as if they’d been taken to a tag sale and then brought back unsold. Maybe Andrew’s little brother still uses this room sometimes, but no one’s around at the moment. In a cardboard box they have Starfox, Sonic, Super Mario 2 and Mortal Kombat II. It takes a minute to find the right TV/video setting, but eventually it all works. I play a few rounds of Mortal Kombat against the computer, lose, and turn it off. I decide to go down to the kitchen and get a bowl of cereal.No one wakes up as I go down the two half-floors and three full floors beneath that to the kitchen. There are bodies dotting the carpets and armchairs in greater numbers as I get closer to the living room where I guess the main party had been, even two people sleeping on top of each other on the stairs. A light in the hallway that adjoins the landing to the first floor stairs has been smashed, a delicate pile of broken glass on the floorboards underneath, and a bag that had been taped over a smoke detector has come undone on one side and so is hanging precariously by a single strip of duct tape in a way that faintly turns my stomach. Without the sense that I’m investigating to any purpose, I pad from room to room in my bare feet, watching out for broken glass. There’s some vomit in the sink in the main bathroom next to the living room, and a bowl of potpourri spilled into the toilet, floating like rose petals in a duck pond. The shower is running and there are three pairs of sopping pants tangled on the tiled floor. I turn it off, half-thinking I’d actually like to get under the water, but traipsing out and back into the hallway instead, basically right into the kitchen. The end of one of the Lord of the Rings movies is playing on mute on the big downstairs flat screen TV.In the kitchen, I thumb through the mail—Netflix to return, a National Geographic, an envelope from the YMCA—that’s resting lightly on the marble island around the stove. I look at the photos on the refrigerator of Andrew’s sister cranking a pottery wheel and his brother hefting a javelin with a bike helmet resting crooked on his head, and Andrew himself, maybe five years ago, doing a cannonball into a pile of leaves.  When I go to open the fridge’s heavy doors, the back door of the house opens at the exact same moment, so that the cool whoosh of the one and the jangling clank of the other bleed together into a moment that startles both me and Andrew’s mom, who’s just now walking into the house. I turn around to face her, a quart of milk in my hands. We look at each other for a moment, and then, without thinking, I raise the milk to my nose to smell it.“Still good?” she asks, dropping her keys on the side table by the door.I smell it again, and then put it down on the counter. “Yup.”She comes over to the alcove by the fridge and just stands there quietly. “There’s a lot of cars out in the driveway,” she says, after a minute.“I’ll bet.”“Some crashed up a little.”“It was that kind of party.”“It was?”No point in lying as far as I can see. She can see as far as I can, or at least as far as the dining room past the set of glass doors, where three people are lying happily in a pile of pillow fluff.“I’m Alex, by the way,” I say. “I know,” she smiles, deep rings under her eyes that look like mascara bleeding into pools of exhaustion. “You were here for the Oscars last year, remember? We ordered Indian take-out. And besides, I see your dad a lot at the Y. He’s always very friendly. Hey, congratulations, he says you got into…”I shrug and tremble a little. “Yeah, I’m pretty excited. You never know, right, you just have to send in your application and see. Congratulations to Andrew too, none too shabby that he…”She nods. “He seems excited, that’s all that matters.”This week we’d all heard back from our schools. The wild success of nearly everyone I knew was a resounding disappointment to all of us, one that we were just starting to feel this weekend. We’d all gotten in exactly where we wanted, and felt thus somehow cheated of the hard-earned belief that these places were in any way exclusive. Andrew’s mom shakes me off this train of thought by saying something incomprehensible. She looks disappointed and a little proud at the obvious perplexity on my face. “That’s French,” she explains. “I just assumed that since you were going to… and all, in the fall, that you’d…”“Yeah, I don’t speak French,” I say, and we both laugh for just under a second.“I don’t either, really. I’ve just been taking a course to keep myself in shape.”“In shape?”“I mean, I’m doing a ballet course too. Just to keep busy.”Both of our sets of eyes are glazed and our jaws hang loosely near our chins as we speak. It’s clear that we’ve both spent Saturday night seeking a kind of pleasure that contained within it its own punishment, and so, I guess, vice versa. “You just out running errands this morning?” I ask.“Yeah. You know, groceries and that kind of stuff.”“Oh. Can I help you carry them from the car?”“Carry what?”“The groceries and stuff.”“What stuff?”“I was just about to make some coffee, if you show me how to use the coffeemaker,” I say, hastily changing the subject.“It’s okay, Mrs.…” I realize that I don’t know Andrew’s last name.“Mrs.….” But she breaks off too. “I was going to say… but it’s changing back soon.”“Back?”“Yeah, I meet with the divorce lawyer on Tuesday morning.”“Oh, wow, I’m sorry, I had no idea.”“Yeah it’s okay. Andrew doesn’t talk about it.”“Yeah.”I’m about to ask some drunk, stupid question about if she was up at a bed and breakfast in Vermont or whatever over the weekend, but I don’t. 	She shows me how to make coffee, looking at the impressive array of crushed plastic gin bottles and beer cans on the counter and stovetop. “I don’t know what to do with this house, you know, it’s not really mine, and I imagine Andrew’s father will just sell it once everything gets cleared up. I should tell him, Andrew I mean, not to trash the place until then, but I don’t really care, really.”“I’m sure things will sort themselves out…”I leave a belated space for her name, and she fills it with “Ellen.”She’s wearing faded blue jeans that are almost white and a black long-sleeve shirt, tucked in with a thick black belt.  “I was thinking of having some Special K, if that’s alright.” “Sure, help yourself to whatever’s in the cupboard.” A moment later, as I’m looking for a bowl, she blurts out, “On second thought, Alex, why don’t I make you some eggs?”“Oh that’d be great, Ellen, thanks, I’d love that, but I don’t think I can right now. I always get this awful stomachache when I drink too much. Most Sundays I drive to the Y and force myself to dive into the pool and swim it off, but right now I just need to have some cereal and wait.”She gives up on the offer and opens the cutlery drawer to get me a spoon instead. In so doing, she dislodges a turquoise bra that’s stuck in the corner where the drawer meets the oven. Dangling it up to the snowy light on the end of a knife, she asks, “Do you drink a lot?”“Yeah,” I reply.She looks like she’s about to say something but then just shrugs in a way that seems to mean either you really shouldn’t or so do I.The coffee’s ready and I take out a carton of orange juice from the fridge and pour my bowl of Special K, about to eat it standing there, but then something occurs to me.“Hey Ellen, I was going to take this up to that little den in the attic, if that’s okay, and just watch some TV and space out for a bit.”“Okay, I’ll start cleaning up all this crap,” she says, looking forlornly at the colorful array of broken things. 	“It’ll still be here later today,” I say, cautiously, trying not to imply anything. “You look pretty exhausted too. Want to just watch TV for a little? It can’t hurt. Then once everyone gets up…”“Yeah, I feel awful,” is all she says.But she pours herself a bowl of Special K and loads up our bowls and two spoons and two coffee cups and two juice glasses onto a tray, which she gives to me, and she carries the coffeepot and the carton of juice, and we make our way up the stairs, stepping over the people who are still sleeping, me still barefoot, she still in her Vermont weekend boots.“I didn’t know we had this thing up here,” she mutters, looking at the TV setup. “Must be one of the things Jim left around and never used.” “Someone must have brought up this Sega at some point.”We both look blankly at the Sega, which looks blankly back at us. Then we sit down on the couch, and she flicks the remote. Nothing happens. I get up and push the ON button, the sprinkling sound of settled static rising back to the surface of the screen. We eat our cereal skeptically, milk dribbling down our chins, as an image struggles to emerge. The alcohol in my stomach feels like a pit of sleeping snakes, furious as the new grain pulp and coffee tumble down on top. The TV comes to life, animated by what we soon find out is an episode of “Dawson’s Creek.” We have to wait until the first commercial break to learn this, but then we know. It turns out to be a “Dawson’s Creek” marathon, a rare Sunday morning event where they play every single episode back to back.We lean back on the couch, our cereal nothing but a few flakes drying on the sides of the bowls, a misting of orange juice crawling down the edges of our glasses, as one episode follows another.	“You know this show?”“I know of it. Never really watched it though.”We find it almost impossible to follow. The colors and sounds wash over us like the light of a fluorescent aquarium, the kissing faces and front doors, the rows of lockers and holding hands. We can’t separate one from another. We bob in the sweet-smelling, stagnant water of scrawled notes and abrupt breakups and triumphant, temporary reconciliations. Kids about my age sitting on logs in the breathy woods, looking out among the trees and then over at one another, with a sigh.At one moment, after six or seven episodes, I catch a glimpse of the sun shining through the window on the trees behind the TV. It seems to be hovering uncertainly in the sky, wavering, granting us a few extra hours but just a few. All at once, the series will be over and it’ll be a late Sunday afternoon in winter, my last in this town, her last in this house.We watch the characters and root for them nervously, hoping that they’ll succeed, a little at a time, but never so much as to be freed of their bondage to the show, or the sweet idiocy of their youth. We don’t want to wish them disaster, but we know that the series will end if things go too well, and then we’ll be up against the brute flank of a new Monday.There could always be one more episode, we think, like there could always be one more year between this one and the next. The divorce will never occur and I’ll be able to stay hungover and barefoot the rest of my life, never impelled to look my sober head in the eyes.But the show will end. In fact, of course, it already has. We know for sure once the first eerie beam of evening light spills over the TV set and onto the empty coffeepot. After the last of the final credits, a new series of events will snap into motion: sleeping bodies will stir and start to groan, they’ll start waiting in lines for showers and listlessly offering to help clean up. Then we’ll have to start negotiating the gridlock of cars in the driveway; people will exchange phone numbers, the right ones or made-up ones; the snow will start to thaw and spring will start to come, and then this summer and then next year. And Ellen will have to look at her sullen, Ivy-bound son, and pick up his sister and little brother from wherever they are, and the four of them will have to look into the fridge and wonder what to have for dinner, as I drive home across the dark, snowy line that separates one week from the next.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There she sat.  She sat one row in front of me and two columns away.  She sat so well.  She did everything well.  I could stare at her all day.  Wait…wait…here it comes…she smiled.  She smiled!  My 13-year-old eyes had never seen such magnificence before.  It was the dawn of time.  The dawn of my life.  Or at least it felt like it.  I began to see things in a different way.  It was as if the universe shrank down into the size of a small classroom.  My new universe included me and Katie, and my universe had no sense of time or place or anything like that.  No longer was I in school in the middle of no where, South Dakota....  I…was somewhere else.  The fact that the teacher was talking and I wasn’t listening to a word she said didn’t matter to me.  School was for losers anyway, right?  “James.”I looked at the teacher.“I asked you to tell the class a little about the Louisiana Purchase.”“Oh.”I said something I remembered copying off of Lauren’s homework the other day.  Apparently, it made the teacher happy.  I was bound to be called on sometimes in class, because there were only eight of us in the class.  I always had some crap ready to spit out.  After I gave my spiel, I looked back at Katie.  She was looking at me.  I instantly darted my eyes downward.  But they met…for that fraction of a second…they met.  The Big Bang.  In that fraction of a second, my universe erupted in fireworks, painting my vision with brilliant reds and purples.  My week was made.When school let out, I ran the mile back home.  I would’ve skipped home this wonderful spring day, but if anyone else by chance saw me, I didn’t want them to think I was gay.  The moment I got in my house, I dropped my backpack on the ground and I jumped on the couch to commence in my daily routine of watching TV.  My favorite show was on when my Mom came in the door.  She normally didn’t come back till at earliest six.  Why was she here at three?“How was your day at school?”“OK.  Why are you back early?”  She hesitated, and then said, “Oh, uh, there was some trouble at work.”“Oh.”I could sense that something wasn’t right with the way she was talking.  We’d lived just the two of us since Dad left five years ago, and the way she was talking reminded me of that day five years ago.  When I was sleeping, Dad and Mom got in the biggest fight they ever had.  They never had loud fights.  Tc The next morning, Dad was gone, and I could tell that he wasn’t coming back by the way Mom talked.  “Did you take a snack yet?“No.”“What do you want?”“I don’t know.”“Do you want some milk?”“OK.”The chatter on the TV was overshadowed by the volume of my Mom’s silence.“Is there something wrong, Mom?”“No, everything’s fine.”Again, the silence was too powerful.“I have to find a new job, that’s all.”“Oh.”We’d been having money problems since my Dad left.  We were barely getting by until now.“We’re gonna have to move back in with your grandmother in Washington.”And like that, my universe imploded.After my Mom lost her job, I had five more schooldays until we were supposed to move.  That meant five more chances to see Katie.  Five more chances to talk to her.  I’d never before said more than “Hi,” to her.  I once asked to borrow her eraser.  It was so nerve-wracking.  It was one of the most nerve-wracking things I’d ever done.  But now, I had to make a move.  I had to.So on Monday, I told myself that on Tuesday I’d talk to her.  On Tuesday, I told myself that on Wednesday I’d talk to her.  On Wednesday, I told myself that on Thursday I’d talk to her.  And on Thursday, I told myself that on Friday, for sure, I’d talk to her.  And as fast as the beat of a heart, Friday was upon me.  The teacher was rambling on about the Native American’s Trail of Tears, when I was thinking that all I needed was some kind of a sign.  Some heavenly sign that would give me the courage and fortitude to complete my mission.  And then it came.  I saw Katie look in my direction.  If she actually looked directly at me, I have no idea, because I instantly sent my gaze to the floor.  But she looked in my direction nonetheless.  That was the sign I was looking for.  The green light.  I decided that right after class got out, I would go home a different way.  I would go home the way she went home.  Then, somehow I would talk to her.  I would make my move.Katie’s house was about half a mile away down Olden Road.  I started down the path at a quick pace.  I was maybe a hundred feet in front of Katie.  I wanted to put some distance between me and Katie, so that it didn’t look like I was stalking her or something.  Then, gradually, so very gradually, I slowed my pace so that Katie came closer.  And closer.  And closer.  I could hear her footsteps on the dirt road.  I didn’t dare turn around.  I just slowed down a little.  Until finally, we were beside each other.  Now was my chance.  The chance I’d been waiting for since the womb.  And what did I make of this chance?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  I hadn’t thought that far as to what I would actually say to her.  So I just walked.  And walked.  Until finally, God took pity on me:“So where are you moving to?”I didn’t know what to say.“Washington.”  “Oh, that’s neat.”“Yeah, I guess.”We walked on in silence for a bit.“I don’t really want to move, but my Mom’s making me.”“Really?”“Yeah.”“That sucks.”“It’s cause my Mom lost her job.”“Oh.”“Yeah.”“I moved a lot when I was younger cause of my parents.”“You did?”“Yeah.  It’s hard making new friends at first and stuff, but eventually you feel like you’ve always been there.”“I wish I didn’t have to move.”“You’ll always have your memories of here.  That’s what helped me move when I was younger.  I had mementos of where I used to live.  I collected rocks and stuff.  I still have them.”“I don’t have any mementos of here.”“You should get some.”We continued to walk for a while in silence.“Let’s go down to the lake and I’ll help you get some.”“OK.”The lake was a shimmering blue as we approached.  The lake was where us children came on those beautiful summer days to go swimming.  Those were good memories.About ten yards from the waterline, Katie spotted some good rocks.  She collected a couple and I put them one by one into my backpack.  We then walked along the lake and she picked up a few more rocks.  All the while, I couldn’t take my eyes off of Katie as she examined each rock with the delicacy of an angel.       “Look at these.  Look at how smooth they are here.”She took my hand and guided it along the smooth underbelly of the rock.  While my hand touched the rock, I did not even sense the smoothness of the rock.  I only felt the warmth of Katie’s skin gently brushing against mine.  I felt the signal that her body sent to mine via chills that started in my hand and went up my back to the nape of my neck.  And then, I knew what I had to do.  Before we left the lake, I had to kiss her.“I think we’ve found enough rocks for you.”“Thanks.  Do you wanna sit down for a bit?”“OK.”We sat down on a flat patch of grass.  She lied down and looked up at the sky.  So I did too.“What are you going to miss most about here?”“I don’t know.”I looked over at Katie, and I could see the sunlight gleaming on the side of her face.  I wanted to reach out and stroke the side of her face with the back of my hand.  And then, it was as if something had taken over my mind, and I was no longer in the driver’s seat.  Every muscle inside my body wanted to roll over and kiss her.  Every bone inside my body.  Every cell in my body had the same idea.  “The clouds are beautiful today, aren’t they?”“Yeah.”I began to rollover.“That one looks like some type of whale or dolphin.”My body rotated slowly so as not to disturb her cloud-gazing.  I elevated myself with one elbow, and I looked deep into Katie’s shimmering brown eyes.  She continued to look at the clouds.“That one looks like a car.”And then, something inside of me went wrong, and I halted.  I couldn’t do it.  I couldn’t.  I had waited so long to get to this point – this point that I had dreamed about for the longest time.  I’d never have another chance like this one.  “That’s what I think I’d miss most about here if I was moving – the clouds.  We have the most beautiful clouds here.”And then, she looked at me.  Directly at me.  Our eyes again met and my universe exploded.  Without thinking, without the slightest bit of hesitation, I found my head leaning towards hers.  I found my eyes closing.  I found my lips reaching out towards hers.  I found our two heads coming closer, closer, closer.Like a jolt of electricity coursing through my body, our lips met.  As she kissed me back, all thoughts of the rest of the world vanished.  No longer was my Mom out of work.  No longer did I have only one parent.  No longer was I moving away.  For those few seconds of time, my universe was complete.That Sunday, my Mom and I moved to Washington.  I kept every single rock Katie had found for me, and I kept them in a special box inside my closet.  But my favorite memento, well that, I kept somewhere else.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Crimson: What courses are each of you teaching now and what is your favorite part about each of them?David Damrosch: I’m doing a world literature survey course, for undergraduates: Literature 11. My favorite part of it is really finding interesting juxtapositions of works around the world. I have a lot of fun teaching it; for example, the Moliere play ‘Tartuffe’ along with Chikamatsu Monzaemon’s ‘The Love Suicides at Amijima’ is really fun... In this, what’s really interesting is these two playwrights are contemporaries and have never heard of each other, but they’re both writing dramas about the rise of a bourgeois merchant class in an old feudal society. So, it becomes an interesting conjunction to think about that. Leo Damrosch: This semester I’m teaching two courses that are old favorites of mine, one of them is called “The Enlightenment Invention of the Modern Self” that I think began 12 or 13 years ago, and it’s been fine-tuned fairly well. I’m going to teach it again this summer at the Venice Summer Harvard Program. The other one is called “Wit and Humor.” It’s a kind of an eccentric course. It’s a subject that is totally neglected in my field, where it’s regarded as recreational. If people do talk about comedy its in a very high-minded way. This is about why things are funny or don’t seem funny.THC: You both went to Yale. And now you’re at Harvard. Any comments?DD: I was a graduate student also, so Leo escaped from jail sooner than I did! You know it’s a great treat to be here with my brother. We’ve been separated by hundreds of miles for so many years it’s very nice to be at the same place. It is different I think in that the humanities have a more dominant role at Yale than here, so here you are dealing with a broader population. You’re more likely to have social science concentrators in class...It’s a kind of shift of teaching for a broader public and not just for hardcore literature people.THC: Professor David Damrosch, everyone wants to know: how are Harvard students compared to the students you have taught in Columbia?DD: They are rather different. I think that the whole atmosphere is quite different. Columbia is so very urban. People who select to go there are extremely talkative, even a little bit aggressive. You’re often having to sort of get people to quiet down enough to realize they don’t actually yet know very much. Here it’s rather the opposite. You more need to draw students out. The atmosphere’s a little bit quieter. And perhaps sometimes the students feel a little more hesitant to expose themselves before a class. They’re concerned if they really do know enough. It’s a little bit more of drawing them out rather than slowing them down like at Columbia.THC: Did you both have a rivalry growing up? Did you always want to be in literary fields? How was it to live in such a literary household? For both of you, as well as the rest of your family?DD: Well, we are 11 years apart so there was in a way, I wouldn’t say I ever felt like a sibling rivalry, but very much so I was following Leo’s footsteps in terms of thinking from an earlier age, saying I’m going to graduate school when I was still quite young. This was a real possible thing to do. And I started reading 18th century English literature while still a teenager certainly under his influence and fell in love with that, and then found my own interest developing from that start. It was actually reading “Tristram Shandy”; I really fell in love with this fabulous novel,one of the great comic novels of the 18th century. LD: Not as great as “Jacques Le Fataliste.” DD: That’s interesting. I read “Jacques Le Fataliste” after that. I liked them both.LD: We don’t have to prioritize. DD: That’s right. “Jacques Le Fataliste” is so interesting. This is the first kind of adult novel I’d ever read. I thought “Gee.” I wanted to read more stuff like this. And Stern talks a lot about his favorite authors, and if he had said his favorite authors were... Chaucer, I probably would have become an English major.... I think restlessness is also part of why I’m a comparativist; I can’t sit still long enough with one thing.THC: Were you both the “bookworm kid?” What else did you do growing up that brought you to the point you are at today? LD: I had a completely different childhood than David, because his was in Maine, and mine was in the mountains in the Philippines where I was born just before the war, and I spent the war in a Japanese internment camp. So it was a strange place, where although everyone spoke English—it had been in American possession for some decades—still, I was the only American kid in our mountain village, and although I had playmates, who were fairly social, I think still books were a refuge, a contact with the world I knew I had once come from and couldn’t remember. And then when we did move to Maine, it was difficult for me to really be an American kid. I started fourth grade. It was the first time I ever went to a school. I’m sure books went on being a place where I could feel comfortable. But unlike David it wasn’t at all obvious I would have been a literature professor, or even a professor. In those days there was very little advising about or even thinking about careers. You just sort of figured something would come along, and I might not even have been an academic. DD: I actually almost went to Divinity school. Our father’s an Episcopal priest and at the time I was thinking seriously about that. In fact at the end, I had gotten a scholarship for a year, and a trial year in Divinity school, and thought I was going to do that, but unexpectedly then got a scholarship offer from Yale graduate school and actually flipped a coin to decide which to do. And the coin came out for literature.LD: I don’t’ believe the Almighty would approve of that. DD: I should have rather thought in retrospect that the person who would have decided by that means should have gone to Divinity school! THC: What do you both do when you’re not writing epic books or teaching? Any zany hobbies?DD: Do we do anything else? I do a lot of windsurfing. LD: When I was young, I played all possible sports, and it’s very annoying when you get old enough that you don’t know if you can trust your knees anymore! I play squash with my youngest son.DD: You know we should play squash? I was playing squash with my son this weekend. We’ll do it.LD: And photography? Yeah, but I mean it’s a boring life. THC: Professor David Damrosch, you wrote a famous work entitled “What is World Literature?” What is world literature to you and how has that changed in face of an increasingly global world?DD:  One of the most interesting things that’s happened in my academic lifetime is that world literature used to be just, to be comparativist meant you had to have a really good accent in two or three western European languages that were French, German, English, maybe Italian, maybe Russian—but that’s about it. Now it’s become this completely globalized thing. So for me, a lot of this eccentric stuff I just happened to have fallen in love with, they didn’t know what to do with 30 years ago. Now it turns out to be teachable, and you can write about it, so it’s really quite exciting. I guess you also have a change in terms of both of our professional orientations in that we both move towards more engagement with a more public kind of writing and not just scholarship. That’s been again an inspiration to me. I’ve been following in Leo’s footsteps with that. LD: Yeah you get tired of writing for not only a very small audience of academics, but half of them are your rivals, and it’s part of competition. It gets vary fatiguing. THC: Professor Leo Damrosch, your renowned work ‘Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Restless Genius’ unconventionally focuses on an up close and personal view of Rousseau’s life. Can you expand more of what was in your head when you were approaching this biography in illuminating all these aspects of his life that don’t come to the face of most writing?LD: The first thing is that he wrote probably the world’s greatest autobiography, and in my view, invented the way we try to interpret our lives. To give you one quick example, nobody before him to my knowledge writing an account of their life had more than 2 or 3 pages on the first 20 years of their life. He gave 200 pages to the first 20 years of his life, because he thought that’s how he reformed and how certain relationships and certain experiences must be the key to understanding who he is...The only biography in English [was] a 3-volume, very pedestrian work by an English political scientist who really had no time for all the things that make Rousseau half-crazy or unique. First, I just read it because I wanted to know more, but then I thought I could do this in a different way. I thought also it would take a long time. It took 10 years because I was teaching full time. And I thought this was not something I would get tired of, Rousseau himself is so interesting and things other people have written about him would stay interesting, that it would stay fresh and it did. THC: Professor Leo Damrosch, I noticed one of your special fields of interest is the Enlightenment period. If you could go back in time and be any Enlightenment figure, who would you be and why?LD: Oh, I’d be his friend Denis Diderot, who as I just mentioned is the author of ‘Jacques Le Fataliste.’ Rousseau was a really difficult character; his insecurity ran pretty deep. He placed tremendous demands on friends. Diderot was his best friend for over 10 years, and they ended up never speaking to each other. Rousseau was the greater genius, incredibly original and profound. Diderot was like us: he got A grades in school, he could speak fluently on any subject, he was charming, well I don’t know if the word is necessarily charming, women were attracted to him. There wasn’t any downside that I can see to Diderot. THC: Everyone has that guilty pleasure book they secretly enjoy. For some it’s ‘Harry Potter.’ For others it’s ‘Twilight.’ What’s yours?DD: I rarely feel any guilt about any form of reading. I would say P.G. Wodehouse... I read for fun. I’m a big Wodehouse fan. LD: Well, for years, I would have said “The Lord of the Rings,” but then it got mainstream, and now it’s not guilty anymore. But I’ve read it, probably three different times cover to cover before it took off as a popular hit.DD: You know I didn’t realize you had that level of interest in it. It was taking off when I was the right age, and I read it 10 times I think, and I’ve read it with our kids since then. THC: What would you say is one of the biggest assumptions or misconceptions that people make about literary academics, such as yourselves?DD: That’s we’re boring?LD: My wife’s a playwright and once was an academic and she confirms that every time you see the role of an academic in a play, they’re just preposterous. They pontificate; they have all the answers, as often as not the playwright acts like they do have all the answers. They’re insufferable. The level at which they are made to speak seems deeply unintelligent, so then you wonder what on earth do people think academics are if they go to these places and respond warmly to these caricatures. It’s not hostile. Even ones that are meant to be admirable, it’s like they’re always having a ‘Eureka!’ moment or suddenly perceiving some fundamental truth. THC: If you could be a character in any of your favorite works, fiction or otherwise, who would you be and why?DD: It may be really interesting to be Stephen Dedalus in ‘Ulysses,’ but you wouldn’t actually want to be him. But to be in that world would be quite fascinating.LD: I think the greatest novels make you all too conscious of people’s limitations and wounds. You know, I think the greatest novel in English is George Eliot’s ‘Middlemarch.’ It’s just a fantastic book, but it’s also quite a tragic book. Characters who are very intelligent and have high ideals and are good-looking and seem to have everything going right still make terrible, fatally wrong choices and end up damaged. It’s a very sad book. THC: If you were both stranded on a desert island and could only take one book with you, which would it be and why?DD: I would say ‘Proust’. You could spend your life reading ‘Proust’.LD: I would say the same thing, and it counts as more than one.DD: It’s 3000 pages, so you get to sort of go a long way with that.LD: And it has to be read really slowly because it’s a poem. DD: And he lives in Paris as though he were on a desert island so you could kind of feel at home with it.LD: No it’s a good choice. THC: What do you both most respect in each other as writers? DD: With Leo, clarity and not having an axe to grind, but having a real point and not being about self-display. I think that’s very impressive. LD: I would certainly say that of [him], but also his unbelievable range. He doesn’t ever feel like showing off. He can just summon things from completely unexpected areas and pull them together. THC: What has been one of your biggest struggles in writing one of your past works or in general, and how did you deal with it?LD: Well for me I would say, I’ve never felt very integrated with the academic, I shouldn’t say fads but what’s currently hot in the academy, and I’ve always been pretty skeptical of it. Fortunately, if you wait long enough it always goes away and is replaced by something else. Consequently, I’ve always struggled in writing academic books about how much I have to play their game and frame what I’m saying in such a way that they’ll recognize it and what ways. I just want to ignore them and do it the best way I can, and that was part of the reason of why it was so liberating to write for a general audience. DD: When I was in graduate school for comparative literature at Yale, half of all the dissertations at the time involved Balzac or Henry James or both. It was very much like the Monty Python restaurant where you could have the frog on the peach or the peach on the frog. That was the range of options. I had all these interests and I didn’t know what to do with them. I just had a real sense I didn’t want to be one-quarter each of four different specialists, but then it wasn’t clear what to do. So, I just had to let it percolate for 20 years to figure it out. THC: Despite your different fields of interest within literature, have you both ever considered a joint collaboration project or work? LD: I’m not a collaborator type. You are more than me.DD: Although in writing it’s hard.LD: In writing it’s hard. I think it works. When we’ve talked about it, it would have to be something where each of us has a whole area the other one doesn’t know as well. But then our areas are so different it wouldn’t be clear why we’re doing it. THC: What advice would you give budding writers or literary academics?LD: I couldn’t speak for creative writers, but I would urge academics not to think they have to win the race too early. All the pressure now is to do things too fast and not well and most of them know that, but they feel they have no choice. You just got to believe in yourself in order to mature something and get it to where you really feel ready to show it and be judged by it. With all the pressures of getting into graduate school, and getting a job, and getting tenure, you can’t obviously blame anybody for grinding things out too fast, but it’s very disruptive. DD: I think a similar advice for writers too is that there’s so much a media thing of “Oh, the hot new first novel!”...and then the writer gets forgotten. Most of the greatest writers take 20 years to find their voice, and they either will or will not become well-known later. Read as widely as possible. I think too many American writers don’t read enough foreign literature and just go to some writing program and just read the latest stories in the New Yorker. So I think reading more widely and taking time to mature.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst all of the fuss about Harvard’s finances, we are in danger of letting Ad Board reform slip away. The composition and policies of the board, a group of administrators and faculty that evaluates students who violate a major school rule, has been a pressing student concern for many years. With the near-completion of the Ad Board Review Committee’s report, we are closer than ever to seeing meaningful progress. However, in order for reform to go through, the faculty must approve many of the changes the report proposes. And, unless the report comes out soon, it will not be ready in time for the upcoming meeting of the Faculty Council’s Docket Committee, effectively blocking it from being addressed this year. Therefore, we call on Harvard College Dean Evelyn M. Hammonds to work to expedite the release of the report so it can be placed on the agenda for one of the two May faculty meetings.The Review Committee’s report promises to address critical issues that require faculty approval, such as guidelines for sanctions and the composition of the committee. Currently, the Ad Board seems to have a limited menu of punishment options. Offenses as varied as plagiarism and drug abuse are often met with the same response—mandatory time off from the school. This generalized punishment does not reflect the nuances of academic, personal, and other types of problems. Additionally, the size and makeup of the Ad Board is of concern.If we are to see these problems addressed, then the Review Committee’s report needs to make it to the Faculty Council’s Docket Committee within the next several weeks so this body can consider putting it on the agenda for the upcoming faculty meeting. The problem is that the report is stalled in consultations and has not been publicly released yet. Until it is released, the faculty cannot vote on its recommendations. At the moment, the administration seems completely preoccupied with the College’s financial troubles. We understand and sympathize with this focus. But, while Ad Board reform will not save a dollar, let alone the $200 million needed to cover this year’s FAS deficit, this is one issue on which a marginal increase in attention from the administration and Faculty would result in considerable goodwill from students. After a year of budget cuts and somber news, this small investment of time and energy would remind students that one of the College’s end commitments is to a solid undergraduate experience, both in 10 years and tomorrow.Therefore, we hope that Dean Hammonds can lead the effort to have the report released and sent to the Docket Committee. Dean Hammonds is the one person who could unite the disparate groups that must push this report forward together: her office, the Review Committee, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith’s office, and the Docket Committee. Next year, two members of the Review Committee will have left Harvard; former UC President Matthew L. Sundquist ’09 is graduating, and Professor Stephen A. Mitchell is already on leave. The Review Committee is the public face of this change, and, as they move on to other places and projects, the momentum for reform will be lost. This is the best possible time to confront possible Ad Board change, and we hope Dean Hammonds will push the issue forward. We have faith in her ability to represent undergraduate concern well and to end the College’s year on a student-centered note.

The town hall meeting on Tuesday, which revealed details about an intended restructuring of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—Harvard’s largest school—was a definite step in the right direction for a university often criticized for its unwillingness to disclose financial information. Of course, more efforts and openness will be needed going forward if the administration is to avoid criticism of its difficult decisions.
The meeting, led by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, helped to articulate the nebulous financial condition of the university to staff and faculty members who will be heavily impacted by the situation. He discussed pressing issues surrounding the $220 million deficit that FAS is expected to run for the next two years. Ever since last month’s announcement that endowment funding for Harvard schools will drop by a steep eight percent, there has been much confusion about what changes will proceed in the immediate future. Fortunately, Tuesday’s meeting helped remove the opacity that normally characterizes Harvard’s financial behavior.
Breaking the university’s tradition of tight-lipped administrators, Dean Smith clarified just how dire the FAS situation actually is and the types of cuts that will most likely be necessary. The meeting occurred the day after an optional early-retirement incentive program for FAS staff members drew to a close and Smith announced that 30 percent of staff had participated. While he hinted at possible layoffs in the future, given FAS is saddled with such a large deficit, Smith did not articulate any specific plans. In spite of any concrete details, however, the general sentiment among the faculty seems to have been one that appreciates a transparent response to the financial crisis, and we echo that reaction.
We are somewhat dismayed, however, that Smith did not discuss the possibility of pay cuts for high-level administrators, even as other universities move in that direction. At Brown University, for instance, President Ruth Simmons is reported to have taken a pay cut of 20 percent whereas at Harvard, salaries of faculty members and high-level officials have merely been frozen. In an economic climate that threatens the livelihood of many staff members, it seems wrong not to at least consider the feasibility of lower pay for senior university officials. 
All in all, the town hall meeting was a proactive start toward greater clarity, but it came nowhere near providing the amount of information, or the venue for open conversation, that the Harvard community deserves. While we appreciate the administration’s efforts at beginning to communicate more openly about the sacrifices Harvard must face, more directness is required if the future is be navigated successfully.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Escalating violence in the Mexican border town of Ciudad Juarez has finally provided justification for something the United States should have been doing since the early 1990s—securing its southern border.
Over the past few months, Mexican president Felipe Calderon has been deploying troops throughout Mexico to counter gangs and drug cartels, especially those in Ciudad Juarez. His decision is justifiable; last year, over 2,000 people were murdered in the infamous city. The addition of more troops throughout the nation, however, has led to even more violence, resulting in over 6,000 total deaths. With the situation in Ciudad Juarez so volatile, America needs to look after its own citizens in the area. The Department of Homeland Security should deploy National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, where, while not engaging militarily in the conflict in Ciudad Juarez, they can protect Texas residents from violence.
So far, there is no evidence that violence has increased significantly in Texas in response to the Mexican conflicts. But the rate of violent crimes has already increased in major southern trafficking locations like Phoenix and Atlanta, and U.S. officials have warned that the likelihood of border violence eventually spilling onto Texas soil is high. In February, two city councilmen were killed in Ciudad Juarez, and the police chief was forced to resign in response to threats that a policeman would be killed every two days if he refused to do so. In addition, the city’s mayor currently resides in El Paso, Texas—troubling for Texans who fear that violence will trail him and other Mexican leaders if they seek refuge across the border. With such concerns in mind, Texas Homeland Security Director Steve McGraw has requested $135 million to help combat Mexican gangs, which he claimed are “the most significant threat Texas faces.” And, two months ago, Texas governor Rick Perry asked Washington for 1,000 guards to help secure the border.
Some object that Mexico will view a deployment of troops as another reflection of American unilateral decision-making without respect or regard for the interests of other nations. But, when it comes to protecting its citizens, America needs to make decisions that reflect its own interests, and such is the case with the Mexican violence. Collaboration with Mexico in making decisions and determining how to deploy troops is undoubtedly advantageous, but Mexican opposition to increased border control is no reason to sacrifice the immediate safety of the American populace. Americans need to support the Mexican government’s long-term efforts to limit violence without sacrificing their own interests and ideals in the process. 
Others argue that the deployment of troops will only invite more violence by creating new targets and posing a threat to Mexican security. Yet this claim is a defensive one, suggesting that America should only respond once violence has actually spread and that we should avoid inciting or contributing to conflict in any way. Deploying the National Guard to the border, however, is a preventive measure aimed at limiting violence before it is able to extend to the border. Delaying action will leave Americans unprotected when conflict does inevitably spread, and the risk of providing more targets is outweighed by the prospect of endangering Texas civilians’ lives.
Of course, Americans must be careful not to overstep their jurisdiction. While protecting American citizens represents a valid national interest, engaging in the Mexican conflict or entering Mexican territory would involve endangering troops’ lives for the sake of a national battle that does not immediately threaten America’s safety. It is this type of action that would anger the Mexican populace and represent unnecessary involvement in an external conflict not concerned with American interests or ideals.
Retaining a mere border patrol, however, is simply not enough to protect American citizens anymore. With violence within Mexico increasing and the greatest crimes occurring just miles from the Texas border, the necessity of federal measures grows more urgent with each day. Government interference has been successful in the past—in an effort to crack down on drug trafficking, U.S. federal officials recently caught over 750 suspects involved in Mexican drug cartels that had spread to the United States. Here, too, the government should get involved. America needs to guarantee for its own citizens the kind of national safety Mexican refugees expect when they flee their homeland for our country, and for this nothing less than a deployment of the National Guard will do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oh, how times have changed. Forty years ago this month, in 1969, the Reserve Officers Training Program (ROTC) was booted off campus due to student protests over the Vietnam War—which included a violent takeover of University Hall and arson of a campus ROTC building. While we’ve moved away from the era of radical anti-American student activism (for the most part), the policy results achieved by that activism still stand at Harvard. ROTC is now unwelcome here due to the Clinton administration’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which forbids openly gay individuals from serving in the military. Harvard’s continued exclusion of ROTC from campus is not only embarrassingly out of touch; but it is also an egregious display of moral cowardice.
Ostensibly, ROTC’s absence from campus life can be explained because the university deems the military a discriminatory organization. Harvard’s student handbook argues that the federal government’s Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy “is inconsistent with Harvard’s values as stated in its policy on discrimination.” Thus, “the University does not provide any financial or other direct support for the ROTC program at MIT.” 
But, if Harvard’s administrators truly wish to dissociate the university from any organizations they deem discriminatory, intellectual consistency demands that the university dissociate itself from the federal government, not the military. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was signed into law in 1993 by then-President Clinton, not the armed services; the military has no influence over whether the law is repealed. 
Unfortunately, Harvard insists upon punishing 18- and 19-year-old cadets and midshipmen for a law signed into place before they were in kindergarten. But, while Harvard claims the moral high ground by keeping ROTC off campus, it has no ethical objections to associating itself with the federal government, which put the policy in place. In 2005, Harvard accepted federal funding equal to about 15 percent of the university’s operating budget. 
For Harvard to truly be consistent in its opposition to Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, it would have to reject all federal grants and funding. However, the university is inconsistent in enforcing its view on Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, penalizing the brave men and women who serve their country in ROTC to make a political point. Harvard is willing to make sacrifices to end Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell—as long as the sacrifices affect only ROTC students and not the university’s budget.
An extremely negative consequence of the way ROTC has been treated by Harvard and other elite institutions is the dearth of ROTC students at these schools. The ROTC program at Harvard used to boast over 1000 participants; now there are only 29. These numbers are disturbing. Our society should encourage students from the institutions at the pinnacle of higher education to take part in sharing in the sacrifice of serving. 
However, instead of encouraging Harvard students to join the military, the university has done the exact opposite. In fact, then-Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan wrote in 2005 that she felt that the military’s access to Harvard’s Office of Career Services was unacceptable. “I regret making this exception to our antidiscrimination policy,” she said when the Law School was forced to give military recruiters the same access that investment banks and consulting firms have to OCS or lose federal funding.
Rather than discouraging Harvard students from military service because of a law they have no control over, Harvard should be working to foster a return to the spirit of service that once defined its graduates. If the university truly believes Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell is “deeply wrong,” then it is free to lobby Congress and the president. It is free to encourage its professors to speak out. It is even free to reject all federal funding in the name of a higher principle. 
But, instead, Harvard has chosen to exclude ROTC from campus. It has chosen not to fund overhead expenses of Harvard students participating in ROTC at MIT. It has chosen not to officially recognize the program. It has included only a section warning students against joining ROTC in its handbook, but nothing commending the service of those in the program. It has disgraced the very students who have shunned lucrative private-sector jobs in the name of service to their country and caused their numbers to dwindle on campus. I am personally aware of students who were accepted to Harvard and chose not to matriculate here because they intended to join ROTC and felt unwelcome by Harvard. 
Driving students away through making the university an unwelcome place toward ROTC cadets and midshipmen is truly despicable and does nothing to end Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, the university’s stated aim. When asked if ROTC should be invited back onto campuses it’s been excluded from in the past, President Obama answered, “Yes. I think we’ve made a mistake on that.” Harvard should take a cue from one of its most beloved graduates and change its ROTC policy.

“The Pope may be right,” suggested Dr. Edward C. Green to The Harvard Crimson, “The marketing and distribution of condoms won’t solve the problem. Partner fidelity has a much better chance.”
Dr. Green, a senior research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health, directed the Harvard AIDS Prevention Research Project and had worked and researched extensively on the HIV pandemic afflicting sub-Saharan Africa. And his conclusions, expressing agreement with Pope Benedict XVI—who, on his recent trip to the continent, had denied the panacean potential of prophylactics—provoked a miniature firestorm.
While the Center for Population and Development Studies has decided since to discontinue the project, Dr. Green has presented in many interviews and newspaper articles the scientific data wherewith to support his controversial conclusions. Increased availability of condoms has not led to a substantial increase in their use, as such devices carry the social stigma of a lack of trust. But, more dangerously, where the use of condoms has accelerated, there lurks the possibility of “risk compensation”—the phenomenon where the peace of mind afforded by a new technological safeguard, such as seatbelts, actually leads to riskier behavior, such as more reckless driving.
But, as Dr. Green has explained, the real impetus behind Africa’s pandemic, as opposed to other localized AIDS outbreaks, is the prevalence of multiple and concurrent sexual partners. HIV spreads at a markedly more efficient rate within the first few weeks of infection. As a result, if those infected reduced the frequency with which they changed partners or are linked to existing partners—let alone practiced abstinence—the disease could not continue to proliferate at its current prodigious levels. 
If these data are confirmed by continued observation and analysis, both Dr. Green’s and the Pope’s comments indeed will have proven consistent with the findings of impartial science.
But therein lies the difficulty. The financial and political drivers of AIDS research and prevention strategies have an interest in the outcome of any such scientific inquiry. For the conventional wisdom on the subject seeks to form a conclusion not, like science, that is independent of and unprejudiced by the imprecise and unverifiable tenets of morality or religion, but rather one that explicitly undermines them.
As Dr. Green pointed out in a Washington Post editorial, “The condom has long been a symbol of freedom and—along with contraception—female emancipation.” As such, many who promote the use of condoms to stem the African AIDS crisis do so not for their efficacy as much as on principle. 
Of course, Dr. Green and many of his like-minded colleagues in the field do not denigrate the use of condoms, except as the exclusive or primary strategy of AIDS prevention. He describes himself as a liberal, asserts that condoms ought to be available to everyone, and openly admits his previous work in marketing contraceptives. 
His conclusions on the efficacy of condoms in the African pandemic are not wed to any ethical or moral point of view. Dr. Green and those of his ilk are scientists, concerned with what the data say. Or, as he succinctly put it: “I have always been politically incorrect. I have always questioned authority and tried to speak truth to power whatever the consequences.”
Dr. Green exemplifies the former ideal for men of science. The intellectual progeny of the Enlightenment and its assault on the teleological view of the universe and of man’s nature, modern science had won for itself the liberty to investigate material phenomena without regard for the political or moral consequences of their findings. The most certain and dependable knowledge that men can acquire comes only from a rigorous and mathematical inquiry into nature. The tenets of theology or the moral virtues—the most important knowledge for the soul—may have had greater priority in previous societies. Yet the innovation of our age has been to discredit such matters as necessarily spurious and speculative and thus not the subject of real intellectual activity. What matters to moderns is the data—and in its slavish devotion to the data, science gained its intellectual pre-eminence.
But the contemporary field of AIDS research and prevention, at least, does not accord the data such dignity. Dr. Green and those who concur with his findings run counter to the prevailing prejudices. Leftist politicians continue to malign and censure the Pope for his opinions, and the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS shuns “evidence-based” for “evidence-informed” advocacy, willfully blind to any scientific proof that questions its pre-conceived solutions. 
While the Pope and other religious leaders would not sacrifice their moral tenets no matter what the scientific evidence says about AIDS prevention strategy, presumably objective and impartial scientists should have no qualms about adhering so strictly to the data. 
The unfortunate irony of this episode—as Africans continue to suffer from the pandemic—is that those who would arraign the Pope for callous disregard for reality are in fact the ones moralizing in ignorance of the data. Except that they have abandoned a traditional regard for moral virtue and absolute truth in favor of a vain and vacuous worship of freedom.

During the president’s first 100 days in office we have witnessed a steady stream of campaign promises undergoing a transition to political reality. In January, Obama fulfilled a promise to reexamine the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp—and has since ordered the facility to be closed within the year. The latest example, though, came this week, when the president announced that he would be fully tackling the issue of immigration reform as early as next month. Critics were quick to point out that the president might be biting off more than he can chew by adding immigration to the long list of problems he has now promised to address—with the economy and health-care reform the obvious two heavyweights. Nevertheless, we believe that immigration reform is a very important issue that deserves attention now, and thus Obama’s announcement comes at the exact right time.Immigration law is in dire need of a total policy overhaul. With conservative estimates of 12 million people living illegally within our borders, American society faces several problems. These illegal laborers tend to accept lower wages and zero benefits and are often reluctant to report abuse or maltreatment—each contributing to the propagation of social ills. In addition, the federal government is losing billions in potential tax revenue from these workers.The solution, according to the president, would be to offer a path of legal residency to illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S. And, while such a bold proposal is sure to cause a stir on Capitol Hill, the logic behind this solution is fundamentally sound and reasonable. Moreover, it would be unfeasible, expensive, and unproductive to pursue a common alternative solution of launching a campaign to hunt down illegal immigrants and deport them. The plan wisely includes stricter penalties for future illegal immigrants and a bolstering of all immigration enforcements. The borders would also become more tightly monitored to ebb the flow of new immigrants to the U.S.The announcement has already seen positive results. Two major American labor groups, the AFL-CIO and the Change to Win Federation, have united in their support for the plan—agreement that rarely happens. Back in 2007, when George W. Bush proposed a similar plan, these groups had different opinions, which contributed to the failure of the proposal. Hopes are high for more national agreement on the subject. Such legislation could also decrease jingoistic sentiments by making people realize that all immigrants can become meaningfully integrated in the American society.As we wait for more details, we hope that pertinent legislation will continue to be passed. Specifically, we hope to see the Dream Act passed soon. The Dream Act would allow the children of illegal immigrants to take advantage of federal funds to pursue higher education—an obvious step in the right direction for the integration of illegal immigrants into American society.Finally, while the focus of this legislation deals primarily with low-wage immigrants, we should seize upon this opportunity to also raise the cap on H-1B visas in order to attract highly skilled laborers who would help bolster the American economy. America has always been a country of hope, equality, and, of course, dreams. Obama’s immigration plan seeks to preserve this image and at the same time strengthen our country.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I spent the summer after my freshman year working as a researcher-writer for Let’s Go Publications. Alone, I worked my way through much of Mexico by foot, bus, truck, raft, and horse. Although I witnessed extreme poverty and occasional street violence, not once did I feel as if my life was in constant jeopardy. This past fall, in Creel, Mexico, 14 innocent civilians were gunned down in open daylight on a street I used to stroll on often past midnight. Their deaths were a casualty of the intense war between drug cartels, community law enforcement, and federal troops that increasingly engulfs parts of Mexico. 
The Mexican citizens’ situation is tragic. Although Mexico is far from a failed state as some suggest—at least not on the same lines as Pakistan—and drug violence is not new, there is no doubt that the country now finds itself in its most dire conflict since  revolution disrupted the nation in 1910.
But drug wars are not Mexico’s problem. They are everyone’s problem. Drug consumers and the wider world have long been complicit in the violence and death that now garners so much attention.  
Earlier during the week, Secretary of State Clinton bluntly declared that the insatiable U.S. demand for illegal drugs is the overwhelming reason why cartels fight each other. Although more Mexicans are becoming addicted themselves, the vast majority of drugs flowing through Mexico right now will be snorted, puffed, or injected by Americans, Canadians, and even Europeans. 
Exploding demand for cocaine within the European Union is now just as much a relevant factor for violence in Mexico (and Colombia) as U.S. consumption. The situation in Mexico is a pattern echoed on all corners of the map: Temazepam (the British’s number-one prescription fix) migrates from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom, opium from Southeast Asia to India and China, and heroin flows from Afghanistan to everywhere.  
Amidst the cries for tighter border security, drug legalization, and foreign intervention, people need to question the bigger picture. In addition to economic and security considerations, there is a huge moral problem with less developed countries becoming enveloped in violence to supply the drug demand of more developed countries. 
No matter how many National Guard troops are sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, violence and death will not stop until drug demand in the North Atlantic is curbed. And those who think the violence is likely to spill over into the U.S. are right. There have already been kidnappings in Phoenix and gang wars in Vancouver. This is a shared social dilemma, and a joint effort is needed to reach a solution.  
No matter what specific policies are crafted, the major theme should be this: Although the military may have to be used to control the spread of violence, this only attacks symptoms of the problem, not the source. Ultimately, nothing will address war like the ones in Mexico if it does not curb U.S. and European demand. We need to start treating international drug trafficking as a common public health problem rather than just a security issue.  
Researchers in the U.S. have proposed focusing on prevention, treatment, and education programs to curb demand rather than continue the war on drugs as is. RAND studies in the ’90s found that channeling money into treatment and prevention would be seven times more cost-effective than law enforcement efforts alone and could potentially cut consumption by a third. 
In the U.S. especially, some have hastily pointed to the violence in Mexico as a case for the decriminalization of marijuana, and even harder drugs. But that argument is symptomatic of the all-too-popular American mindset to not think about internationally interconnected problems thoroughly. Legalization in the U.S., Canada, or more European countries will exacerbate the violence if the same drugs are not legalized in Mexico. Demand would boom, and the competition to supply the product would intensify. Cartels would fight the government and each other even more to control precious supply lanes through borders. 
The ugly fence along the U.S.-Mexico border is not achieving anything if we don’t remove the even uglier walls in the public mindset that separate American consumerism from the violence mere miles away. The simple fact is, if you’re doing drugs in the developed world, even recreational marijuana, you’re clearly involved in a morally compromising system. Comprehensive steps must be taken to rebuild a culture that takes little account of the ramifications of its practices. Certainly, this will be difficult, as much of the drug usage in developed countries is done by the socioeconomically underprivileged. But it must be done. 
This Monday, “4/20,” is an American holiday for pot-smokers. Drug usage is a terrible, unhealthful habit that I do not support. However, if on Monday you do plan to smoke weed, at least buy American. If not, your habits may kill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Come June, hordes of Harvard students and recent graduates will descend upon New York City. Their reasons for settling there will vary widely. Those ambitious pre-bankers who hope to land that coveted position at [insert financial firm with head above water here] will gleefully devote 90-hour weeks to their firms, returning to their apartments only to shower and sleeping under their desks for approximately 90 minutes per 24 hours. Budding musicians and aspiring journalists will set up camp in Williamsburg or at NYU housing, hoping to work up enough hipster cred to create a cleverly named tumblr that people might actually read. Finally, there is the PBHA wunderkind-turned-activist. These heroes of the summer score public-service fellowships that allow them to live in the city for three months and devote time and energy to the type of things that make the world a better place.
As a member of the second bracket two summers ago, I experienced simultaneous waves of horror and jealousy toward my investment-banking cohorts so strong that, for a moment, I wondered what it would be like to be an exhausted but well-paid shell of my former self. I also had such sudden feelings of moral inadequacy compared to the wunderkind that I would glance at my $15 well drink and ask whomever was around (sometimes a stranger, sometimes to myself): “What am I doing in New York?”
As a senior on the verge of graduation, I feel like much of my world is simply going to be uprooted and transplanted to New York City after June 4. NYC is the Mecca of the social and economic lives of Harvard students in the real world: Not only is it perceived as being the natural—often default—next stop in the lives of the young graduates of elite colleges, but New York’s glossiness also indicates a sort of ultimate achievement of the cosmopolitan refinement and worldliness that Harvard students work so hard to cultivate and realize.
Whether it’s for the summer or forever, the magnetic pull to New York City—like that exerted on energetic bugs by a sophisticated flame—has long been undeniable. But an undercurrent of dissent is beginning to appear, as the collapse of the financial market has thrown some of the pitfalls of this high lifestyle into high relief for young people. There is, believe it or not, life outside of New York City. And, although it might be different, it’s probably not as terrible as you think.
My decision to live somewhere other than New York or another East Coast outpost next year seems to confound people. It’s hard to convince folks that I’m living in Mississippi by choice and not under duress. Yet I’m not alone in my decision to eschew the New York life. My friends from Harvard are settling in places as diverse as Louisiana, Illinois, and Oregon next year. Most are living in cities, although a few are opting for the suburban and rural life. And why not? While some might see forsaking the opportunity to gallivant around the Big Apple during young adulthood as being unadventurous or provincial, I interpret it as the opposite. Choosing to move to the rural South is not a retreat, but a venture into a world that is far less familiar to me than the streets of New York. I could easily see myself settling in the city, working in Manhattan, and coming to view a road trip as a drive to Queens. This terrifies me.
The feeling of necessity over the Harvard-to-New York relocation can manifest itself for any number of reasons. Some students simply like New York and want to live there, and some favor the city because of the concentration of jobs in the metropolis. Others say that their desire to move to New York stems from an inability to see themselves elsewhere: They’ve always assumed they would live in New York, and so they limit their searches for jobs and graduate schools to the city in their crystal ball. But that sort of logic—and the mass migration that results from it—is flawed because of the chicken-or-egg scenario it presents: Graduates go to New York because it’s the only place they see themselves, but it’s the only place they see themselves because everyone up and moves there in Life After Harvard. It’s a vicious cycle, only in that it often encourages people to follow the path of least resistance and mature without a diversity of geographic experience.
My roommate that summer in New York had gone to college in the city and was then writing for a lesbian magazine. She spoke often about the importance of queer journalism; she wrote, she said, for “that lesbian in Wisconsin”—the heartland-dweller who relies on New York publications as her outlets and sources of information. Remembering that these people exist outside of the city is crucial: For this young journalist, the battle was halfway won. But why didn’t she pack her bags and try living in Milwaukee or Madison, Montgomery or Mobile? Perhaps those places, and not New York, could be alternative, logical next steps.

Entering its second year, Harvard Business School’s 2+2 Program has seen a significant increase in student interest in advance of the July 1 application deadline, according to Managing Director of MBA Admissions Deirdre C. Leopold.While the Business School received 630 applications for the 2+2 program last year, over 2,200 prospective applicants have attended information sessions this year, Leopold said.“Interest on campuses has been very high,” she said. “We’ve been filling sessions.  We’ve had people standing in hallways.”Admission this year is likely to be more selective, Leopold said. Despite the increased interest, the school does not plan to admit more than about 100 students, the number accepted last year. The 2+2 program allows students to apply to HBS in the summer following their junior year of college.  After graduating, admitted students enter the workforce for two years and then study for two years at the business school.Leopold and a panel of admitted students—currently seniors at the College—discussed the program with Harvard College students in a packed Fong Auditorium on Tuesday.Despite the turnout of Harvard students, Leopold emphasized that the program was seeking students from diverse backgrounds—and other universities.“News flash: this program was not designed for Harvard College,” she said, drawing laughter from the audience.  Leopold said in an interview that the program was conceived as a way to attract students who might not otherwise think of business school as an option.  Some of the benefits of 2+2—such as access to an HBS career coach—were meant to appeal to students whose colleges do not have high-caliber career services offices, she said.In last year’s “cohort” of 2+2 admits, 22 of 106 admitted students attended Harvard College.Leopold attributed the increase in interest to the program’s expanded marketing campaign and the fact that word is out among college students.Several students said that they were attracted to the security that the program gives.“You know you have an MBA spot locked in,” said Anthony A. Pino ’10. “It allows you to be a little freer in the two years after graduation.” In trying to attract a diverse applicant pool, Leopold and her staff have visited 58 schools this year.  These have included large public universities, in addition to engineering schools, liberal arts colleges, and Ivy League universities.The program aims to attract more students with science and engineering backgrounds by showing the relevance of a business degree to those fields, Leopold said. The school’s message about science appealed to Mary Caroline Szpak ’11, who attended Tuesday’s information session at Harvard.  Szpak, an environmental science and public policy concentrator, said she has little traditional business experience.“It’s a good program to study science and learn to apply it when I get out,” Szpak said.  “You can use your undergraduate degree in a very unconventional way.”—Staff writer William N.

Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius will be this year’s Commencement speaker for the Harvard Kennedy School, University officials announced yesterday morning. 
Her selection drew a mixed response from students. 
While many students said that they are receptive to hearing Sebelius speak at the June 3 graduation ceremony, some added that they had hoped for a more high-profile speaker.
“My heart didn’t skip a beat when I heard about it,” said Sam H. Sanders, who said he had wanted President Obama to be the graduation speaker. He also added that Sebelius—who has been nominated as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services—is the University’s second commencement speaker linked to the Obama administration this year. U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu will be speaking at the College’s commencement as well. 
“While I, as a progressive, don’t mind, I wonder what all the conservatives at Harvard are thinking,” he said.
Gary J. Mann, another student, said he would have preferred a Republican speaker at Commencement. 
“It’s healthy to bring in a partisan viewpoint,” he said. “We hopefully train both Republicans and Democrats.” 
But according to Edward K. Sebelius, the Governor’s son and a Kennedy School student who will graduate this year, the speech is unlikely to be partisan in nature. 
“She has spent a lot of her time in public office trying to diminish partisan politics,” he said.
Robert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis, also commended Sebelius’s bipartisan reputation. He said that he and many of his health policy students felt Sebelius was an excellent speaker choice and looked forward to hearing about her policy suggestions as well as her experience in public service.
The Kennedy School typically asks its commencement speakers to discuss the value of a career in public service, according to Joseph J. McCarthy, the director of degree programs. He speculated that Sebelius may have been selected in part because of her connection to the Department of Health and Human Services, an area in which Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 served during the Clinton administration. McCarthy added that Sebelius’ policy interests coincide with many hot topics at the Kennedy School, such as education policy and health care.
Kennedy School student Leroy E. Foster said he would like the governor to discuss her plans for health policy. 
“I’m really interested in what she has to say, particularly because the administration will be involved in ambitious health care reform,” he said.
Edward Sebelius said he hopes his peers will find his mother’s speech worthwhile. 
“I’m really proud,” he said. “And I’ll be totally nervous until her speech is done.”

With just a month left before the end of the spring term, time is dwindling if the Ad Board Review Committee’s report is to be implemented by the end of this academic year.The report—which addresses potential changes to the Administrative Board, the College’s main disciplinary body—was presented to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds on March 6. Many of the suggestions proposed by the report, including any potential changes to the disciplinary policy appearing in the Student Handbook, must be presented to the Faculty Council and will require the approval of members of the faculty at a full Faculty meeting.At present, only two Faculty meetings remain before the end of the school year: one on May 5 and one on May 19. In order for consideration of the changes to appear on the next meeting’s docket, the Dean must submit an official request to the Faculty Council by 9:30 a.m. on Monday, April 20. The deadline for the May 19 meeting is the same time on May 5.Historically, student complaints have centered on the Board’s lack of transparency and the absence of student representation within it. Former Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71 first proposed that the College review the procedures of the Ad Board in Spring 2007, and Interim Dean of the College David R. Pilbeam convened a small review committee in November 2007.After receiving the report early last month, Hammonds said she planned to look through the committee’s suggestions and respond with comments and questions of her own. Once Hammonds submits her revisions to the review committee, a final version may then be assembled for potential public dissemination.In an interview the day she received the report, Hammonds declined to provide a date for the report’s public release. “I think it’s going to take me a bit of time to read it carefully, to convene people in the college to talk about it, to talk about it with others, to give them some feedback, and give them some time to respond, so I would give that some time,” Hammonds said.Secretary of the Ad Board Jay L. Ellison said there is still a lot of discussion occurring between Hammonds and the members of the reform committee about her suggestions to the report. Since the report was requested by the Dean of the College, many of its parts could be adopted at her discretion without requiring a Faculty vote, Ellison said. He said that even if the report did not come before the Faculty before the end of the year, the changes the Dean would approve independently could still be adopted.Ellison said that it was “likely” that the report would be brought before the Faculty at the May 5 meeting. He said that he thought the Faculty would be pleased with the suggestions made by the committee.UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 sent a letter to the Dean this Monday on behalf of the UC asking about the status of the report. Flores said she has yet to receive a response from Hammonds.“We would encourage Dean Hammonds to be very transparent about the recommendations of the report to counteract the past confusion about the Ad Board,” Flores said.—Staff writer Lauren D.

In an inaugural effort to streamline the operations of Harvard’s scattered science libraries, four will merge underneath the administrative purview of Harvard College Library in July.The Physics, Statistics, Chemistry and Chemical Biology, and Mathematics departmental libraries will report to Lynne M. Schmelz, the librarian of Cabot and Tozzer Libraries, which fall within HCL. The remaining science libraries will see plans for an eventual administrative transfer to HCL, which manages the circulation of over 11 million items.The news—which was e-mailed to members of the library system by Jeremy Bloxham, dean of science for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—came five days before Tuesday’s town hall meeting, where FAS Dean Michael D. Smith unveiled a shift from small cost-reduction measures to a sweeping reevaluation of FAS structure in the face of a $220 million deficit.HCL spokeswoman Beth Brainard said the plans for consolidation were “not associated with the budget.” Even before the financial crisis hit Harvard, library officials had been entertaining the idea of revamping the structure of the science libraries to create greater efficiency, she said.The consolidation of services and collections across the science library services would facilitate interdisciplinary research and economize the purchasing, licensing, and processing of materials, according to Bloxham’s statement.But Brainard did not deny the possibility of cost-reduction measures. Given the current fiscal picture, the merging of the science libraries under one administrative umbrella is likely part of a concerted effort to shave costs, according to two library staffers interviewed yesterday.“Any plan to consolidate in this climate is basically a retreat—a step back to contain losses, to try and control expenditures,” said Richard E. Kaufman, who works in the psychology department library, one of the science libraries that has yet to see plans for consolidation. “How far can things be allowed to slide?”At a meeting of the Science Library Council on Monday, administrators emphasized that the plan was not driven by the desire to slash budgets. But a librarian in one of the science libraries said she believes that the declared manifesto will not necessarily leave staffers completely secure.“We’re sure that there will be job cuts,” said the individual, who asked that she not be named in order to protect her relationship with the University. “We’re not naive.”In February, HCL displaced 17 workers in the Widener serial services division to a Central Square facility currently occupied by HCL’s technical services unit as part of an effort to help reduce its budget for next year by $12 million. —Staff writer Esther I.

The co-authors of a book on the interface between internet and politics ascribed a recent national political realignment to the rise of a “Millennial Generation” immersed in on-line, social-networking technologies at an Institute of Politics event yesterday.   Authors Morley Winograd and Michael D. Hais, together with Kennedy School professor Elaine C. Kamarck, emphasized the centrality of a young generation—born between 1982 and 2003—to the rise of the Democratic party in the 2008 election, and said that the influence of this “Millennial” voting bloc would only continue to grow. In March 2008, Winograd and Hais published their book “Millennial Makeover: MySpace, YouTube, and the Future of American Politics,” which accurately predicted a win for democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama after years of republican domination. The two authors cited statistics yesterday stating that 80 percent of Obama’s winning margin was composed of youthful “Millennial” voters, whose proficiency with Web-based social-networking sites allowed candidates to mobilize followers while also allowing followers to mobilize each other.The emphasis on the importance of on-line outreach struck a chord with Jeffery F. Solnet ’12, student chair of the Special Events Committee at the IOP. “I think the reason we had this event was because the topic of technology is so exciting amongst the number of students here who were involved in the Obama campaign,” said Solnet.The Obama campaign made a name for itself in the 2008 election for its innovative use of Web tools to catalogue and organize voters. The large size of the Millennial generation, coupled with the fact that most people who identify a party affiliation early tend to stick with that party, suggests that the generation’s influence is here to stay. The Millennium contingent made up 17 percent of the electorate in the 2008 election, and could potentially account for 24 percent of voters by 2012 and 36 percent by 2020, the authors said. “I thought students at the IOP would be fascinated to hear about [Winograd and Hais’] book because it’s about you guys,” said Kamarck, the Kennedy professor, after the event, referring to the undergraduates who attended last night’s event.  The event, entitled “Millennial Makeover: How MySpace and YouTube are Transforming American Politics,” was a dual effort by the Harvard Political Union and the Special Events Committee at the IOP.

A Cambridge chef stationed just two T stops away from Harvard Square was recently named one of the Best New Chefs of 2009 by Food and Wine magazine—netting an award that he said will bring some “new light” to his restaurant, but will not distract him from his present work. 
Barry Maiden, who was acclaimed in March for his Kendall Square restaurant, “Hungry Mother,” said he found out about the award in a phone call last month from the magazine, which boasts a total annual subscription of nearly a million, and serves as a sponsor for the Emmy award-nominated show “Top Chef.”  
“I was really overwhelmed and excited, I really thought they had the wrong number when they called,” said Maiden, originally from Saltville, Va., who rose to success in the Boston area after having worked at various restaurants since the age of 17.
Hungry Mother, which opened in March 2008, specializes in charcuterie— “all things pork and anything that can be salted, cured, pickled and preserved,” according to Maiden, who offered his assurance that “every dish is brought out and tasted and re-tasted.” 
Michael Leveton, chef and owner of “Lumiere” restaurant in Newton, who employed Maiden for four years, called the Food and Wine award an honor that 
“puts you on the food and wine radar for the rest of your career.”
“Barry was very dedicated to the craft and always wanted to keep the learning curve steep,” Leveton added. “His kind of energy and dedication is difficult to find.”
David V. Hale, the director of career services at the New England Culinary Institute, where Maiden studied from 1999 to 2000, recalled, “Barry was a rare combination of skill, with a great balance of confidence and humility.”
“For him it’s always been about food, not about accolades, which is the defining characteristic of being a great chef,” Hale said. 
Growing up, Maiden said, he never thought he would become a chef, and spent a brief period in the U.S. Army. But cooking has always played a central part in his life. Growing up in the South, Maiden said that family dinners were always a special time.
“We grew up around the table,” he said. 
In fact, the beef tongue on the menu at Hungry Mother is a family memento, according to Maiden’s cousin, Jill Howard, who added that, when he was young, Maiden was “the pickiest eater.”
Despite his newfound recognition, Maiden said he would largely continue his present work, at the most starting a few “side projects that don’t interfere with the mother-ship of what we have going on here.”
Laurie Lefevre, Food and Wine magazine’s director of corporate communications, could not be reached for comment yesterday.

Two professors stressed the importance of implementing an ethnic studies curriculum in a discussion at Sever Hall yesterday evening. Seventeen students gathered to hear Glenda R. Carpio—an associate professor of African and African-American Studies—and Jigna Desai—a visiting associate professor in the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Department—praise a newly-proposed ethnic studies program, which they said would allow students to discuss questions of racial and ethnic identity in an academic setting.“People end up talking in dorm rooms or over this kind of food, which are very powerful media,” she said over a table of desserts from Finale’s. “But the idea of finding an academic home for these kinds of conversations is important.”Both Carpio and Desai said that an ethnic studies curriculum would have to be interdisciplinary.“I think that’s part of the richness of what ethnic studies could bring,” said Carpio. “I think it would be helpful to see what the African-American Studies Department brought to Harvard. It is an interdisciplinary approach.”Both professors said that there would be challenges to implementing an ethnic studies program, including the possibility that such a curriculum would result in students simply studying their own cultures, and would therefore preclude meaningful academic pursuit.“It’s not about numbers. It’s not about demographics. It’s not about feel-good narcissism,” Desai said.“The charge of anti-intellectualism is something we need to expect as ethnic studies comes to Harvard,” Carpio added. “It’s an easy target. We have to be smart on how to expect the resistance.”Quinnie Lin ’09—who helps coordinate the Ethnic Studies Coalition, a student group that advocates for an ethnic studies curriculum—said that she was pleased with the discussion.“I think this conversation was great in that it was the first step in fostering student-faculty communication, and we really need students to work with faculty and administrators to establish a sustainable program in ethnic studies,” she said.As for how to win over critics, Lin said the answer is education.“I feel like this mostly stems from the fact that people don’t understand what ethnic studies is,” she said. “People who make those arguments haven’t delved into it in depth. It’s a very challenging field.”

A recent research project by Ohio State University researcher Aryn Karpinski has reported a correlation between Facebook usage and grade point averages. Despite specializing in a relatively  unrelated field of quantitative analysis, Karpinski was inspired to investigate the effects of the social networking site Facebook on the performance of college students. Karpinski analyzed extensive surveys of both a quantitative and qualitative nature from over 200 Ohio State students. Her data suggested a correlation between Facebook usage and lower GPAs among college students at Ohio State University. “Although this study has investigated an area totally outside of my realm of specialization, I was greatly intrigued by the interplay of Facebook and academics,” she said.Recently, many news sources have cited Karpinski’s findings when making the claim that Facebook itself is a cause of lower academic performance. But Karpinski’s data only demonstrates correlation, not causation.Kevin Lewis, who is a Ph.D. Candidate in the sociology department at Harvard and has studied Facebook interactions, wrote in an e-mail statement, “What this study tells us is that there is an association between being a member of Facebook and having a lower GPA; it tells us virtually nothing else.” Karpinski also acknowledged that her study does not reach a definite conclusion. “I totally acknowledge the limitations of this study,” she said. “It is meant to be an investigation into the association of Facebook usage and academics and admittedly does not reach a definitive conclusion on the topic.”Karpinski intends to continue investigating the intriguing association between the Facebook frenzy and academic performance.But Lewis noted that this is a difficult topic to address.“These questions are at once too simple and too unwieldy—they make for great dinner-table conversation and theoretical speculation, but virtually any attempt to talk confidently and generally about these types of mechanism is begging for trouble,” he wrote.

A dispute during an externally-sponsored event on the prospects for Chinese democracy caused the Harvard University Police Department to remove audience member Wei Chaoyong, a visiting scholar at the Harvard-Yenching Institute, from the Fong Auditorium yesterday evening. The event featured Szeto Wah, a prominent Chinese dissident and the Chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movement of China, who said that the international community would be mistaken to think that the country’s communist government was moving towards a more democratic society. “On the surface, the Chinese Communist government has allowed some concessions toward democracy,” Szeto said, speaking in Chinese. “In reality, that’s not the case.” During a period for questions after the presentation, Wei objected to Szeto’s pessimism, suggesting that he was not taking a nuanced view of the situation facing the Chinese government. “I was jailed for Tiananmen,” Wei said in Chinese, referring to the infamous 1989 demonstrations in which democratic student protestors were forcibly removed by the Chinese military. “But I disagree with your [Szeto’s] dwelling so negatively on past history. I think we should move on, and think about Chinese Democracy critically.”  Wei continued to speak for about five minutes. Many among the audience, which included Harvard undergraduates and outside visitors, responded, urging Wei to “calm down, please,” before Harvard University police were called to the scene.In an interview after the event, Wei said that he was saddened to hear the negative audience reaction to his interjection.“If we truly care about China, we should see if democracy is the only acceptable form of government,” he said. “We have to consider how democracy would be transplanted to Asia.”  Szeto’s talk touched upon the degeneration of Chinese morals, offering anecdotes that he said showed the dissolution of traditional marital and family values.“Maybe some people think I’m too pessimistic. But I don’t think I’m pessimistic—just realistic,” Szeto said. “If China doesn’t improve, doesn’t adopt democracy, Hong Kong will not improve, will not have democracy.”“I think that the disruption showed there’s such a difference of political opinion within the Chinese community,” audience member Jeffrey Kwong ’09, added after the event. But a divergent opinion did not justify Wei’s tactics, according to Kwong. “I think at a place like college, you should have a level of respectful decorum for a speaker, and the audience tonight clearly did not understand that,” Kwong said.

Harvard has signed another custom loan agreement to increase borrowing options for graduate students, some of whom have had trouble securing funding in the wake of the credit crunch, University officials announced yesterday.The deal with the Harvard University Employees Credit Union will allow eligible Harvard graduate students to borrow a maximum of $250,000 for their education without a co-signer—a safety net required by many lenders. Discussions with HUECU have been ongoing for the past six weeks, and the recently completed contract will take effect on April 23 for the next three years.The arrangement—which marks the first time that HUECU will be offering student loans—follows a similar deal penned in February with JPMorgan Chase and will increase the funding options available to international students. After Citibank abruptly pulled out of previous custom loan arrangements with Harvard and several other universities in October, Harvard administrators were left scrambling for alternative ways to help students cover the cost of attendance while maintaining the University’s commitment to financial aid across the graduate schools.“Our overall objective is to ensure that a Harvard graduate education remains accessible to talented students regardless of where they live,” Harvard’s Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore said in a statement yesterday.Citing the historically higher probability of default by international students compared to American students, a Citibank spokesman said at the time that the frozen credit markets caused lenders to shy away from issuing high risk loans.HUECU president Eugene J. Foley acknowledged that the credit union will likely see higher default rates on international student loans.But because the credit union—unlike commercial banks—is a not-for-profit organization, profit maximization for shareholders is not a primary concern. As a result, the credit union is able to offer more competitive rates and arrangements for borrowers.“Everyone shares profits equally through lower rates,” Foley said, explaining that the credit union acts in the interest of all its members.Harvard administrators are not negotiating with any other lenders at the moment, University spokesman Kevin Galvin said, as the graduate schools have already begun to accept students for the next academic year.—Staff writer Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before a packed crowd at the Institute of Politics Forum last night, David Plouffe—President Obama’s former campaign manager—spoke about the highs and lows of the campaign trail as well as the importance of the campaign’s volunteer force. 
Plouffe, a visiting fellow at the IOP this semester, began by addressing the campaign’s surprising loss in New Hampshire and went on to discuss topics ranging from John McCain’s pick of Sarah Palin to the current state of the Republican party.


Plouffe then fielded questions from audience members who lined up at microphones positioned throughout the forum.
Eva Z. Lam ’10, president of the Harvard College Democrats, and Malcom A. Glenn ’09, former president of The Crimson, posed questions to the political operative for the first half of the event. 
The dedication of Obama’s supporters came up as a reoccurring theme during Plouffe’s remarks.
“I think a lot of our supporters in the end believed that if they spent one less hour not working, [Obama] might not win... and there was some truth to that,” he said.
Glenn started off the evening asking “What the heck happened?” during the New Hampshire primary that resulted in an Obama loss to Hillary Clinton.
Plouffe offered several explanations, including tough attacks from the Clinton camp, the portrayal of Obama as a “rock star” in the media, Clinton’s “moment of emotion,” and a “subterranean battle with John McCain for independent voters.”
But, ultimately, he said, “I don’t think any of us can say for sure why we lost.”
Plouffe said that for much of the primaries, he was unsure what the result would be.
“We knew that one wrong moment and we’d fall off the cliff,” he said.
Plouffe was pressed to address Palin, McCain’s controversial vice-presidential pick.
“She was our best organizer and fundraiser,” he said. “So she really helped in that regard.”
At one point, Plouffe called Newt Gingrich the current quarterback of the Republican Party and Rush Limbaugh the party’s announcer.
Plouffe also gave Harvard students some advice about getting involved in campaigns.
“You’ve got to show that you’re willing to get your hands dirty. You’re not going to be doing much thinking,” he said.

David Plouffe, chief campaign manager of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, addressed students at the IOP forum yesterday. 
Plouffe is in large part credited with Obama’s successful strategies in the primaries and the general election. His  ability to retain the strength of the Obama campaign post-Super Tuesday, his efficient organization of a grassroots political effort, and his willingness to compete in traditionally Republican states are widely seen as key factors in the Obama victory.
Plouffe sat down for an interview with The Crimson yesterday to talk about life after the campaign and the impact of Obama’s successful presidential run on the future of American politics. 


The Harvard Crimson: Barack Obama called you the “unsung hero” of the 2008 Presidential Campaign. What do you think were the most successful aspects of your strategy?
David Plouffe:  I think the unsung heroes of the presidential campaign were all of our millions of grassroots supporters who made this victory happen. We had sound electoral strategy in both the primary, which was to try to win Iowa and win delegates from as many places as possible and in the general election. But your success starts and ends with the candidate, and we had a unique candidate who met the times.
THC: What were your first impressions of Barack Obama when you met him?
DP: Well, he’s clearly a guy with great leadership qualities. But I met him back in 2003, so I could not suggest that I thought five years from then he would be the 44th president of the United States. My first reaction was, ‘This is the type of person we need running for office.’
THC:  How do you think the demographics and the electoral map of the United States are currently changing? 
DP:  Four years ago, you would not have said a Democratic nominee would win states like Indiana, North Carolina, and Virginia, so I think you cannot look at what happened on November 4th and assume that in November of 2012 that that is going to be terribly educational, because things can change rapidly. Presidential campaigns are like a puzzle. You’re trying to piece together 270 electoral votes. And I think right now there’s no doubt that we have an easier path than Republicans do. The Republicans have their own process to work out. They have to decide if they’re going to be the party of no or if they’re going to help out occasionally.
THC: And can I glean from that you don’t currently have plans for 2012?
DP: I think the President smartly believes that that needs to be put to the side, because we’ve got tough decisions to make and we’ll worry about 2012 when we get there.
THC: Your daughter was born two days after the 2008 election. How are you enjoying the ability to spend more time with your family?
DP: It’s a wonderful thing—even small things, like picking my son up from school or having breakfast with my family, are highly meaningful. When you break out of [the campaign], it’s an eye-opening experience because you remember, ‘Wow, this is what life is like!’
THC: How do you think Barack Obama changed the face of politics?
DP:  I think what he proved is that you can ignite something in the American people at the grassroots level that can help win an election and potentially change the country. He showed that you could win being who you are, and that the American people are willing to be leveled with and spoken to honestly… Not every campaign will have the success we did in igniting the grassroots and having them play such an important role in the campaign and the ultimate victory. But campaigns should try, because having people involved in their government is very good for this country.
THC: What was a typical day like on the campaign?
DP: Well, I think for everyone who worked on the campaign–from me down to the floor organizer–it was just relentless. You’re working 16-18 hour days easily. You have a lot of stuff flying at you. And so you basically are trying to make sure that every day you stay on track, you have something that you’re trying to accomplish, and that you’re making progress towards that. But you have interferences all day long: opponents attack you, the press may have some new investigative story, there may be some event in the world. So that’s what makes it challenging. It’s a relentless pace, and for us it was two years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at Harvard were disappointed with NASA’s announcement that Node 3 of the International Space Station will be called Tranquility, even after the name “Colbert” received the most votes during the online contest to name the component. “Colbert” won because Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report encouraged his viewers to write his name in for the contest.Nearly 1.2 million votes were made in this online contest, over 230,000 of which voted for the name “Colbert.” The name Serenity came in second place with 190,000 votes. Several students said they thought it was unjustified that NASA did not choose the first-placed moniker.“This is absolutely outrageous, its totally undemocratic,” said Dylan R. Matthews ’12, an avid Colbert Report viewer.“I am morally outraged,” added Brendan C. Quinn ’12.But they were somewhat appeased when they learned of NASA’s reason for dubbing the component Tranquility.NASA chose to name Node 3 Tranquility because of the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11, which landed in the area of the moon known as the Sea of Tranquility, according to a NASA press release from Tuesday. Although the component was not named “Colbert,” NASA will call its new space treadmill COLBERT (Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill). The announcement was made Tuesday night on The Colbert Report by NASA Astronaut ‘Sunita Williams, the first person to run the Boston Marathon in space.But the decision to name a treadmill after Colbert was perplexing to many students.“It seems like a slap in the face, it’s like naming a dixie cup after him,” said Ryan P. Halprin ’12.Others said that they thought the decision reflected NASA’s opinion of Colbert’s appearance.“He is dashingly handsome—he doesn’t need a treadmill,” said Jennifer Lim ’12.The COLBERT Treadmill is expected to be launched to the ISS in August and the Tranquility node is scheduled to be launched to the station in Feb 2010, according to the NASA press release.

After what Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds called a “nationwide search” by the College administration, Interim Director of the Harvard College Writing Program Thomas R. Jehn has been named the program’s permanent director, Hammonds announced in an e-mail to students yesterday.
A writing instructor at the College since 1997, Jehn has served as interim director of the program—which oversees the Expository Writing program, the only required course at Harvard—since former Director Nancy Sommers stepped down in the summer of 2007.
Assistant Director of the Harvard College Writing Program James P. Herron called Jehn’s selection a “great choice.”
“He’s a really great administrator; he’s done a fine job as interim director and he brings a lot of knowledge about working with students,” said Herron.
According to Herron, Jehn has focused on better integrating students’ Expos experiences with the writing they are doing in their other classes. 
He also added that Jehn hopes to increase the number of Expos classes offered on topics relating to the social sciences. 
“He displays a deep commitment to teaching the craft of writing, and his vision for curricular and co-curricular initiatives will provide new support for writing activities throughout the College,” wrote Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris—who led the director search—in the e-mail.
Jehn served as the director of the Extension School Writing Center from 2000 until 2003, when he was appointed assistant director of the Harvard Writing Project. 
In addition to Expos, the Harvard College Writing Program comprises the Harvard Writing Project and the Harvard College Writing Center. 
“Dr. Jehn’s experience in a wide array of writing initiatives at Harvard makes him uniquely positioned to lead and develop the College Writing Program successfully,” Hammonds wrote. “We are confident that the program will continue to flourish under his guidance, as it serves the varying needs of College writers.”
After directing the Expos program for 13 years, Sommers announced in July 2007 that she would be “on leave” for the coming academic year. 
She then told The Crimson a month later that she did not plan to return to her position as Expos director but would not specify her reasons for leaving the program.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate Academic Programs Georgene B. Herschbach told The Crimson last year that the College was postponing the search for a permanent Writing Program director until after the selection of a permanent dean of the College. 
Though Hammonds was selected for the post in March 2008, Herron said the College did not being a search for the director until this spring. 
Jehn could not be reached for comment yesterday.

Coming off of consecutive one-goal losses to No. 3 Cornell and No. 2 Princeton, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team dropped another close contest yesterday in its match at Harvard Stadium against Brown.  
Even though the Crimson (5-5, 1-3 Ivy) outshot the Bears (10-2, 3-1 Ivy) 31 to 27, it was not as successful as Brown in finding the back of the net, ultimately coming up short in an 8-6 defeat.
“We knew it would be a challenge,” Harvard coach John Tillman said, “But we didn’t play as well as we would have liked. We had a lot of mental errors and didn’t execute as well as we would have liked.”
The Crimson came out strong with the first goal of the opening period when junior attacker Travis Burr fed the ball to sophomore attacker Dean Gibbons on the right wing. where he finished in the top right corner of the net from 10 yards away.  
The Bears responded a few minutes later when Brown attacker Thomas Muldoon beat senior goaltender Joe Pike, firing a shot in the top left corner.  
The Bears added two more goals in the last five minutes of the period, one apiece from attacker Andrew Feinberg and midfielder Brady Williams, to put Brown up 3-1. 
Harvard recovered in the second period and bounced back from the Bear’s three-goal spurt.
“We did not panic and kept playing hard,” Tillman said, “Our seniors showed great leadership and it says a lot about the senior class.  The way they have been handling themselves has really been really impressive to me and I think that’s a big reason why we came back.”
The Crimson came out with confidence and put Brown under pressure, firing two consecutive shots that hit the top post. 
After regaining possession in the ensuing scramble, Gibbons faked around the circle, coming from behind the net to finish low for his second goal of the night.   
Midway through the period, Feinberg, who came into the game ranked sixth in the country with 3.91 points-per-game, scored his second goal of the night when teammate Thomas Muldoon found him from behind the net and he ripped a shot past Pike. 
Harvard responded two minutes later. 
Junior midfielder Jason Duboe sent a pass to captain midfielder Max Motschwiller cutting across the field and Motschwiller fired a shot from 10 yards in front of the net into the back of the goal, bringing the score within one. 
Although the Bears led 4-3 at the half, the Crimson had an 18-10 advantage in shots and a 12-11 edge in ground balls.
Brown came out strong in the third period. 
Feinberg tallied his third of the goal of the night, his 32nd of the season, less than two minutes into the frame. 
The Bears notched two more in the next three minutes on scores from Charlie Kenney and Reade Seligmann to build a 7-3 lead.	
Harvard kept the pressure on with frequent shots, but was denied time after time by Brown goaltender Jordan Burke. 
Burke, last season’s Ivy League Player of the Year and a Second Team All-American, totaled 12 saves on the night.  
“You have got give the kid credit,” Duboe said, “[Burke] is a great goalie and he certainly takes away a lot of your strengths as a shooter by baiting you.  I mean the kids [an] All-American.”
“[Brown] plays a defensive style where they make you shoot certain shots and the ones they force you to take [Jordan Burke] gobbles them up,” Tillman said.
The Crimson eventually broke through Burke’s defense with an unassisted goal by Duboe at the end of the third period when the junior blasted a shot from 15 yards out, closing the gap to 7-4.
Two minutes into the fourth period, a loose ball in front of the cage caused Burke to step out and challenge, but as he strayed from goal freshman attacker Jeff Cohen gained possession and slipped the ball into the net for a Harvard goal.  
Minutes later, Cohen struck again, his team-leading 20th goal of the season, to bring the score within one.  
Over the last 10 minutes, the Crimson had several opportunities to score but came up empty-handed. 
With less than two minutes remaining, the Bears tacked on an insurance goal, its eighth score of the night, for a final score of 8-6. 
“If you make a mistake [Brown] will get you,” Tillman said. “We made a couple in a row, and they made us pay.”

Thirteen is one unlucky number. The Harvard women’s lacrosse team found this out yesterday as No. 13 Dartmouth scored 13 goals on its home turf, beating the Crimson for the 13th year in a row. Despite a tough fight in the last three minutes of play, with Harvard scoring three goals, the Big Green (7-4, 4-1 Ivy) had a comfy seven-point lead to send the Crimson (4-9, 1-4 Ivy) home with a 13-6 loss. “It was kind of the usual thing, simple turnovers, mistakes, not really capitalizing or staying structured throughout the game,” sophomore defenseman Sam McMahon said. “It was definitely an improvement from Saturday [‘s 17-5 loss] against Princeton.”Dartmouth sophomore Greta Meyer scored the first tally of the game in the first five minutes. Harvard soon evened it up as freshman Katie Doherty won a draw control and passed the ball to junior tri-captain Sara Flood. Flood whipped it into the back of the net, scoring her 17th goal of the season. That would be the only goal for the Crimson in the first half, as the Big Green outscored Harvard, 13-5, going into the break. Winning the next draw control, the Crimson gave up the first of three major turnovers that allowed Dartmouth to score its next two goals with 20 minutes on the clock. “We came out flat,” freshman goalkeeper Kerry Clark said. “They came out really strong, so the first half we kind of dug ourselves into a hole and had to chip away at it.”Attacking Clark with seven shots in the middle of the period, the Big Green never looked back, extending its lead to 6-1 as the final seconds counted down. Clark made four saves in her 33 minutes of play before being switched for junior Katherine Martino. As Dartmouth scored three goals in the first seven minutes of the second half, the Crimson began to turn the heat on. With three saves from Martino, Harvard’s attack began to take more attempts at Big Green junior goalie Julie Wadland. Crimson freshman Tyler Petropulos finally stopped Dartmouth’s streak with her 16th goal of the season, after taking a pass from Flood, to get Harvard going. But the Big Green continued to stomp on the Crimson’s defense with two back-to-back goals in the middle of the half to give Dartmouth an 11-2 lead. “It really comes from the draw controls, and we had been struggling with that in the beginning of the game,” McMahon said. “Scoring goals definitely comes from whoever wins the draw controls, so if you can win the draw controls, you can win the goals.” With 13 minutes left in the game, Harvard scored four of the next six goals. Off a feed from senior Kaitlin Martin, Doherty put the first of the Crimson’s four into the net. Unfazed, Dartmouth scored two more in under a minute, leaving Harvard with little hope.Nine minutes later, after a stretch of scoreless play, the Crimson was more than frustrated. Picking up the tempo, sophomore Jess Halpern gave the ball to Martin, who sent a shot into the goal with three minutes left in the game. Harvard’s streak continued less than a minute later when Petropulos picked up the draw and sent it to Halpern, who watched as her free position shot went into the net. Petropulos finished off the Crimson’s run with her second goal of the game off of a pass from Flood. Despite the last-minute burst of energy, Harvard could not muster enough attack in the beginning of the game, allowing Dartmouth’s offense to outshoot the Crimson 25-14 overall and pick up more ground balls by a count of 23-12. Dartmouth’s defense also helped with the win, holding Harvard’s Halpern and Martin to one goal each. “I think really we just didn’t have the ball that much,” Clark explained. “We had limited opportunities on offense, because they had the ball the majority of the time. It was a lot of defense, and that has been a theme throughout the season, because we play opponents who get the ball more than us.”With the last two loses, the Crimson will try to reclaim its rhythm at next Saturday when it hosts Columbia in Senior Day at Harvard Stadium.

Meet Favia Merritt. She is pre-med, enjoys filmmaking, serves as a personal trainer, served as the treasurer for Harvard Unite for Sight, and she runs for the Harvard track team.So what can’t she do?She is allergic to exercise, she has dislocated both her hips numerous times, she is allergic to the cold, heat, pressure and friction, and has chronic sinusitis and bronchitis.  But despite all of these things, the senior still managed to find the drive–and the time–to be one of Harvard’s top sprinters the past three years.“She is an incredible student-athlete,” head coach Jason Saretsky said.  “She has a host of allergies and she has had to work through many injuries.”“But no matter what has been going on, she has always found a way to persevere, and get out there to compete for us,” he continued.Through numerous trials to find the perfect workout, passion for the sport and unyielding commitment to the team, Merritt has been able to overcome the numerous obstacles that have been thrown at her, and help the Harvard track team steadily gain momentum through the years.“I absolutely love track and love the team,” Merritt said.  “And being on the team and having such wonderful people around me has motivated me to keep going.”Merritt’s optimistic attitude has been a key factor in her success on the track.“Favia’s persistence comes from her ability to keep a positive attitude through hardships,” Merritt’s teammate Sean Gil said. “She can tolerate a huge amount of discomfort, and never lets it limit her performance. Deep under her bubbly personality, there is subtle and intense determination that seems to drive her to achieve.”Her presence is always well known at meets, whether it is when she is flying past her opponents, cheering for her team, or providing entertainment when nothing else is going on.“She’s just a fiery competitor and she has one of the most remarkable screams for her teammates that you would ever hear,” Saretsky said.  “She always comes out with so much support for her teammates.”Her support for the team has been unwavering since her arrival at Harvard.  And even when she had to take time off from school to have multiple surgeries to help with her allergies, Merritt did not miss a beat on her arrival back in Cambridge.“With the health issues she had freshman year and the tough class schedule she is always juggling, it would have been really easy for her to stop,” senior Brittan Smith said.  “As a teammate, I am grateful for what she contributes to our team. As a friend, I am even more grateful to have her there.”Merritt’s hip injury has been with her since the eighth grade, and her allergies have been with her since she was only seven years old.  Learning how to cope and progress with these ailments have been crucial in her success as a collegiate athlete.In spite of her many ailments, Merritt claims the school record in both the 100 meters, at 11.82 seconds, and the 4x100 meter relay, her two favorite events.  She also picked up the Pappy Hunt Award her sophomore year for improvement, and the Women’s Most Valuable Performer Award last year.Merritt’s diet is one more trait that separates her from the rest of the team.  Her pre-game meal includes a chicken burrito from the infamous Felipe’s Taqueria, and her appetite continues throughout the entire meet.“[Her appetite] is quite weird, because doing that would make other people sick during practice, but it makes her feel better.” Smith said.This past weekend, Merritt led the Crimson at the Harvard/Yale-Oxford/Cambridge meet in New Haven, Conn. She took first place individually in both the 100-meter run and the 200-meter run, and helped the 4x100 team claim the first place title as well. For her dominating performance, Merritt was named co-winner of the most valuable performer’s award.This weekend will mark the last home meet of the regular season, and Merritt and the rest of the Harvard track and field team are ready to compete.“I see her finishing up really strong as she has established herself as one of the top sprinters in the Ivy League,” Saretsky said.  “Going up against Yale this week where she will have a big day, and hopefully finishing up a strong season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say that defense wins games, and the Harvard softball team learned that the hard way yesterday. Though the Crimson (21-13, 7-5 Ivy) offense was firing on all cylinders, it wasn’t enough to hold off a late-inning rally from Boston College (15-24, 1-8 ACC). Eagles sophomore Allison Kooistra led off the bottom of the seventh inning with a shot over the center-field fence, giving her team the 7-6 walkoff win at Shea Field in Chestnut Hill.“We’re excited we found our offense today—we hadn’t scored six runs in a long time,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “We had that game. One runaway inning for our defense…[we] need to help our pitcher on the mound and we would have won that game.”In the early going, it was all Harvard. Although freshman pitcher Marika Zumbro got herself into an early jam—issuing a leadoff walk that was followed by a single—co-captain and catcher Hayley Bock picked off BC’s lead runner to get the game’s first out, allowing Zumbro to settle down. The rookie starter responded by striking out the next two hitters.The Crimson gave Zumbro some breathing room in the top of the second, putting three runs on the board. Freshman Whitney Shaw drew a leadoff walk, and after junior Jessica Pledger reached safely on a fielder’s choice, classmate Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, dropped a single into left center.Bock came up with two outs and drilled a double to left field, plating rookie pinch runner Eve Rosenbaum. Vertovez followed her co-captain with another double, driving in Schellberg and Bock.“We came out swinging our bats, and we hit the ball pretty hard,” Shaw said. “We’ve been putting a lot of work towards [our offense] so we all knew that was going to come eventually…I think [last week] was a low point, and we’re on the upswing now.”Harvard added to its lead in the following frame. With junior Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson sports editor, aboard, sophomore Ellen Macadam hit a dinger to left to give the Crimson a 5-0 advantage.“We know we can count on her to get a hit when we need it,” Vertovez said. “[Macadam] was actually going to bunt that at-bat, but 0-2 she comes in and hits a home run—much better than a bunt.”But the Eagles came roaring back in the bottom of the fourth, taking advantage of a number of Harvard errors. After junior Margaux Black, who came on in relief to pitch out of a jam in the third, loaded the bases, consecutive misplays from Vertovez at shortstop let two runs cross the plate. “We got into a little bit of trouble, and our defense should have been there to pick up our pitchers,” Vertovez said. “The defense makes the plays and we get out of that inning no problem.”BC would get one more run on a suicide squeeze and the Crimson would commit another error before Black could escape from the inning. While Eagles pitcher Allison Gage was finally able to quell the Harvard offense, allowing just one hit in five innings of relief, the BC bats claimed the lead in the bottom of the sixth. After getting one run across on an Amy Tunstall single, the Eagles celebrated their first lead of the day, 6-5, when junior Blair Destito belted a two-run shot to center.The Crimson came back to even the score in the top of the seventh, this time taking advantage of a few BC miscues. Vertovez drew a leadoff walk and came around on a pair of Eagles errors. But the comeback was for naught, as Kooistra ended the game in the bottom of the inning with her longball.“It’s never fun to lose on a walkoff home run and have to walk off their field,” Vertovez said. “We wanted to get back in there and score some more runs. We just have to capitalize earlier and we won’t run that risk.”Black, who took home Ivy Pitcher of the Week honors for her 13.2 innings of scoreless ball last week, was saddled with her first loss of the season after allowing seven runs, four earned, in 3.1 innings of work.Harvard will look to get back on the winning track tomorrow when it opens a crucial four-game series with Ivy League North rival Brown in Providence, R.I. “We want to take four games from them,” Vertovez said. “Our offense is on the upswing right now, and we know our pitching will be there when we need it.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Consider it mission accomplished, but by no means game over. Coming into the season, the Harvard men’s volleyball team had a number of aspirations, including hopes of attaining a playoff spot, something it hadn’t done since the 2005 season. Check that one off the list—and add on a few more. Tonight’s match against Rutgers-Newark (8-13, 5-2 Hay Division) in the Golden Dome in New Jersey isn’t just the Crimson’s last regular season contest; it also represents a chance for Harvard (11-6, 6-1) to take the Hay Division title outright.
“We set our goals high, trained hard, and we have a lot to show for it,” junior co-captain Gil Weintraub said.
Such an achievement would pay off in the short-term—giving the Crimson the seventh seed in the EIVA Conference Championship instead of the eighth—as well as set up Harvard for the future. The winner of the Hay division each year moves up into the Tait division, composed of teams like Penn State, currently ranked seventh in the country.
“Taking a shot at bigger teams, although you may not be as successful in season, is definitely going to improve everyone as volleyball players,” Weintraub said. “You really want to compete at the highest level possible, and the Tait division is that for us…I would love nothing more than for Penn State to have to come to the Malkin Athletic Center, go up four flights of stairs, and play on our court.”
If Harvard loses tonight, however, it would enter into a tie for the division title with Rutgers-Newark, and the Scarlet Raiders would hold the tie-breaker in total games won.
So it all comes down to this, going on the road for a high-stakes regular season finale. It will be no easy task, but history is on the Crimson’s side. While Rutgers-Newark has not played since April 3—a loss to last-place Sacred Heart—its opposition is currently on a six-match win streak in conference play. In fact, Harvard’s most recent win, which clinched a share of the division title, was a 3-1 victory over Sacred Heart last Saturday at the MAC.
The Crimson also has a pretty good idea of what to expect tonight, as it rallied at home over one month ago to hand the Scarlet Raiders their first league loss of the season. Facing a 2-1 deficit, the host team picked up its offense when it needed it most, relying on clutch hitting by co-captain Brady Weissbourd and freshman Matt Jones to close out its second league win. Currently riding a string of three consecutive road wins, the Crimson will do its best to use past performances to its advantage.
“We think we’ve picked up on a few tendencies of their hitters, so we’re going to adjust our defense to shut down their leading attackers,” Jones said. “In every match, serving and passing consistently are big for us.”
Yet again Harvard will lean on its big hitters to carry the load. Weissbourd is currently sixth in the nation with 5.28 kills per set, as well as third in the country in service aces and tenth with 1.40 blocks per set. The rookie Jones is second on the team with 3.06 kills per set, and Weintraub is 13th in the nation in assisting his attackers with 12.35 per set.
While considering past performances, the Crimson will be well-served to avoid a repeat of the last time it made the playoffs. In 2005, Harvard laid an egg in its regular season finale, posting a 0.000 hitting percentage in a drubbing by St. Francis. The sorrows followed in its playoff opener, when it fell 3-0 to top-seeded Penn State, ranked third nationally at the time.
But now in the first year of coach Brian Baise’s tenure, the Crimson is looking for a fresh beginning, and it’s off to a good start.
“We’re trying to start a new era, to have some consistency when in the past few years we’ve had some coaching changes,” Jones said. “We’re [heading] in an established direction.”
Whether it is the seventh or eighth seed, Harvard will finally enter the promised land of the postseason after a three year hiatus.
“The young guys are excited for this opportunity to take a crack at making a difference, and for seniors like Brady and [Jeff Nathan], they know this is their last shot,” Weintraub said. “They have made it clear to the young guys that Friday, this is where we win and Rutgers loses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard baseball team heads down to Providence to play a four-game weekend set against Brown, the squad knows that it controls its own destiny—just barely that is.The Crimson (10-22, 8-4 Ivy) currently sits three games behind first-place Dartmouth in the Ivy’s Rolfe Division, with the team desperately trying to make up the ground in the two remaining weeks of the season.What makes this weekend so intense? The Bears (14-15, 8-4) are in the same position.Harvard and Brown are knotted at second in the standings, and each team knows that it must win the series to have any real chance at catching the Big Green.“We could play very good baseball against Brown, get a split, and it would probably eliminate us,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. For Harvard, this means going to the Bears’ home field, and taking at least three-of-four from them, preferably a clean sweep.In addition to the pressure that comes with a must-win series, a fierce rivalry has defined the matchup between the two teams for years. Clearly, there will be no love lost this weekend—last year Crimson ace Shawn Haviland ’08 described his feelings towards the Bears: “They don’t like us, we don’t like them.”Awaiting the Harvard players will be a hostile Rhode Island crowd.“It’s always pretty intense when we go down there,” senior Tom Stack-Babich said. “Their coach is fiery and they feed off that. It’s always a pretty heated battle.”But the tough atmosphere does not scare Walsh or his team.“I worry about the players on the field and not the fans or the coaching staff,” Walsh said. “We’ve played in front of some wild crowds at Brown but we’ve also played in front of some wild fans around the country.”Instead, the Crimson comes into the series feeling confident. A beanpot loss to Boston College at Fenway on Monday was sandwiched in between Sunday and Tuesday’s double-headers against Yale, in which Harvard took three of four from the Bulldogs.As it has been all season, some very timely hitting was the key for Harvard. In the second game of Tuesday’s twinbill, captain Harry Douglas knocked a single through the infield in the bottom of the ninth to take the series victory.The win marked the Crimson’s fourth walk-off win in its last eight Ivy League games.“I think that we’ve been a pretty gritty club,” Stack-Babich said. “We’re getting big hits when we need them and doing just enough to win.”Add a number of come-from-behind victories as well, and Harvard’s season has not been short on drama.Given the Crimson’s proven mettle in close games, nobody is ruling out a late-season surge to put the squad atop the Rolfe Division and into the Ivy championship.“We just want to make sure we can play up to our capabilities and I think the wins will take care of themselves,” Walsh said. “This season, it hasn’t been about how good the other team is, it’s come down to how well we play the game—whether we’ve been able to move runners along and take our opportunities.”Brown, however, might see the situation a little differently.Whereas Harvard still has to play Dartmouth, and can thus make up games more quickly, the Bears do not have as much control, making this weekend’s key contests doubly important for the home team.Brown boasts a powerful lineup capable of doing some damage to the young Crimson pitching staff, beginning with senior center fielder Steve Daniels.Daniels—a former Ivy League Rookie of the Year—is a prototypical leadoff man, having stolen an incredible 73 bases in his career.Leading the team in both slugging and on-base percentages is cleanup hitter Pete Greskoff. The sophomore first baseman made the Ivy League honor roll this week for his two-home run performance in the series against Dartmouth.But Harvard too received representation on the honor roll. With his walk-off hit to go along with his .450 average over the course of the week, Douglas ensured his spot on the list as well.The heart of the Crimson lineup is comprised of seniors, and the veterans will need to continue their strong play if they intend to make a playoff push in their final season.Second-baseman Taylor Meehan and outfielder Matt Rogers join Stack-Babich and Douglas as Harvard’s main offensive threats.“The seniors have really stepped up,” Walsh said. “That’s the difference from last year.”Last year, the seniors on the team floundered, and with them went Harvard’s season. By the time Brown came up on the schedule, the games had been rendered meaningless.Not so this year.“We’re ready to come out and we’re ready to take them,” Douglas said.—Staff writer Jay M. Cohen can be reached at jaycohen@fas.harvard.edu.

Back in 1773, when they had the first Boston tea party, things were a little different. People had that catchy slogan "no taxation without representation" and were fighting against an imposing British government.
This time, not so much.
As April 15 was tax day, people across the country—from Washington, D.C., to Boston—took this opportunity to get their tea bagging on. Whether wearing tea bags as strange hats or harassing CNN reporters (tip: Wonkette), conservatives have been out protesting the Obama administration's tax and spend liberalness. While last time according to Wikipedia "the protest was not a dispute of high taxes," this time it very much is.
Eva Z. Lam '12, president of the Harvard College Democrats, did not understand the point of the protests. "They're just hanging out and being like taxes suck," she said. "I think it's really stupid."
"We live in a democratic country with fair and free elections, they just lost.," Lam said.
The Harvard Republican Club didn't seem very excited about the events either. "No one from Harvard that I know of participated," said HRC President Colin J. Motley '10.
He wrote in an email,
I think the bottom line is that they're protests of an issue organized by people who are unhappy with the way President Obama has chosen to make policy. As a demonstration of the organizers' intended purpose, I would rank their effectiveness as much better than the SLAM hunger strikes of a few semesters ago.
On a related note, I can say I paid my taxes this year.
According to the event's Web site there was a tea party at the Boston statehouse from 10am-8pm.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
There we go...now you're starting to see that impending wave of final papers looming for the last week in April.  A little tutorial paper?  Another one for your Core?  Some seminar class you've been coasting through all semester?  Time's up folks--you'll be lugging a bag full of Widener books for the next couple of weeks.
As you prep for pre(worse than?)-reading period hell, brush up on your internet skillz (thanks Daily What!). Consider the humorous, and slightly scary power of Google Earth.  Take on an awesome NYT feature on old, lonely, bored, rich men paying for the companionship of young, beautiful women (and bask in the moral ambiguity!).  Also, FlyBy would like to quickly pour out some liquor for that poor dying newspaper industry by checking on some fascinating uses for useless newsracks (Don't get any ideas, 'Poon).
Inspiration?  While FlyBy knows you've already seen this Susan Boyle from Britain's Got Talent clip, we advise to just watch it again.  Quality TV.

Here at FlyBy, there is little we love more than stalking the illustrious alumni of the College. Today, while perusing the Interwebs, we came across a video of rising funnyman Simon H. Rich '06-'07 doing a little bit of standup comedy on Collegehumor.com.  The former president of the 'Poon and current SNL writer (the youngest ever, we hear) muses on the providential dealings behind Octomom, the California woman who gave birth to eight children in January (and may be getting a reality TV show out of it).
Watch the video after the jump. And for more Simon, see the interview he did with Fifteen Minutes magazine last year.

Wow--how bad is the economy really??  Apparently pretty bad.  The University's been taking such extreme measures as eliminating the January Experience and acknowledging the possibility of layoffs.  But forget about all that.  The real sign of the apocalypse?  Opening the doors of the exclusive Faculty Club to the riffraff ordinary students.  Now, far be it from FlyBy to draw a link between the economic situation and a bunch of grubby freshmen descending on old Abbot Lawrence Lowell's little gem.  But the question remains, is the "Special Invitation" to "come, celebrate, network, and relax" a worthwhile endeavor for non-members?
FlyBy decided to take immediate advantage of the opportunity to get a glimpse into the lifestyles of the rich, prestigious, and "uniquely Harvard" among us. Only a Harvard ID card and a lunch reservation were necessary—find out more after the jump!
The journey into the mysterious and inacessible Faculty Club begins rather as one would expect. The entrance area gives a distinct impression of old money, or—like at a final club—money that extends beyond the means of ordinary students. A large percentage of the inhabiting population is made up of older men in sport jackets, many of whom seem to know each other. A piano is conveniently located in the back—probably to make the room seem inviting.  Really, it functions as a reminder of just how wealthy the Club is (used to be?). Points to whoever is first to pound out a gut-wrenching rendition of "Chopsticks."
After the entrance area, an immediate turn to the right will bring you to the Main Dining Room, where a reservation is key—but these can be made online with no inquiries as to membership status or Harvard affiliation. After a few questions about the reasons for being there, FlyBy was directed to this area to wait to be seated. All staff members were very polite, but FlyBy still felt some skepticism under there. Jeans and backpacks, while standard college student attire, are not included in the dress code at the Faculty Club.  Take note.
FlyBy was seated alone in the corner of the Dining Room near the maitre'd—a decent vantage point, to be sure, but one that is tucked away from view of other tables. The level of service easily surpasses that of HUDS, who won't do you the courtesy of taking your coat, placing your bag inconveniently behind your chair, or pushing you closer to the table while asking if you're comfortable. But how about the food? After all the FOOD (and spaces that serve it) are supposed to be the attractant. What student will go for the overnight accommodations when he or she lives two blocks away?
Armed with a $15 budget, FlyBy had to choose carefully from the menu. There is a buffet available, but at $21.75 is hardly the most economical of options. Unlike Harvard Dining, only the rich get to eat all that they want here. The menu says NO TIPPING in large letters near the bottom, which will make stingy college students breath a sigh of relief, but then the fine print underneath says that there is a surcharge of 18 percent! Even if your party is less than six people! Sneaky, indeed.
To accomodate this obnoxious expense situation, the smoked turkey club sandwich with fries seemed like an appealing option. The Thursday Chef's Special, London Broil with mushroom sauce, was tempting but would probably lead to a longer, less efficient lunch. And Harvard students can't be bothered to wait for their food. After ordering the former, service took 13 minutes to deliver, which is just enough time to skim over those lecture notes or memorize a few foreign language vocabulary words.
The sandwich was of elevated quality because of the smoked turkey breast; otherwise it's probably best to just make your own at the dhall and not spend 12 bucks on it. The fries were more like potato wedges with crispy exteriors. The servers spare the indignity of having to request ketchup, as they are kind enough to bring it out with the plate.
After a total of $14.25 and 30 minutes, the Faculty Club dining experience came to an end. A worthwhile adventure, but probably not worth blocking out a regular spot in one's schedule. Unless you are already as rich and pretentious as the target market, not much is to be gained from a visit other than a decent meal and a chance to practice some over-the-top politeness. And of course, the realization that you don't want to be these people in 30 years. Unless you do.

April 9--exactly one week ago--marks the 40th anniversary of the infamous student takeover of University Hall.  That's right. Forty years ago, a mob of angry students barged into the administrative building and kicked the deans out.  FlyBy didn't know the anniversary had passed--but considering FAS's projected $220 million deficit over the next two years, we probably don't have the funds to invite guest speakers to commemorate an event like that anyway.  More ruminations on student takeovers after the jump.
Cornell, on the other hand, has commemorated their own Spring '69 takeover every five years with a weeklong series of events. They're even about to commemorate the 40th anniversary.  Granted, their takeover has probably been harder to recover from, since it deals not just with rowdy students hating on the administration, but also racial issues.   The Afro-American Society--all of a couple of dozen students--was protesting worse academic conditions for black students.  But when they were taking over the student union, one former protester says, they did so very politely:
Sounds great.  The 30 students who took over University Hall, on the other hand, violently barged in at noon on April 9th. One picked up and carried a dean outside, and another punched an assistant dean in the face.  The students evicted all the administrators and let in hundreds more protesters throughout the afternoon and night, until the number mushroomed to 500.  They wanted ROTC to be eliminated, since the draft was taking so many students away to Vietnam.  They were also angry about what they felt was an out-of-touch administration--the most salient example being the 1968 Commencement, which was held in Sanders Theatre with only the summa cum laudes attending, for the more plebeian magnas and everyone else to watch on television, since they hadn't planned for rain in Tercentenary Theatre.
But back to University Hall.  At 3 A.M. on April 10, city and state police--under the urging of University President Nathan Marsh Pusey--barged in to evict the students.  The protesters had resolved to nonviolence and formed a human chain across the doorway--right before getting arrested.  Though the University had agreed not to press charges, the city ended up putting two guys in jail for nine months for assault and battery (including the one who had punched the assistant dean in the face).  23 students were also expelled, with the possibility of readmission in the future, and three were permanently expelled.
This isn't the last takeover that Harvard has seen, though.  In 2001, several dozen students took over Massachusetts Hall to protest low wages for janitors and dining hall and maintenance workers.  Faced with a tense budget situation again this time around, the Student Labor Action Movement appears to be gearing up—handing President Faust a letter at a recent lunch meeting in Eliot.  But there's a long way to go between envelopes and building takeovers.
