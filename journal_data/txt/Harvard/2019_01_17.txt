After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the tumultuous political climate of 2016, Barbara Kingsolver — known for her best-selling novel “The Poisonwood Bible” — has written a novel that both captures the divisiveness of today’s American society and compares it to the heated debates about evolution and creationism in the 1870s. Although sometimes heavy-handed while getting her point across, Kingsolver intricately weaves the modern storyline with the past to show that no matter how scary the present may seem, American society has been this divided before.
“Unsheltered” tells the two separate stories of families that live in the same house at different times. The 1870s timeline focuses on Thatcher Greenwood, a newlywed and new resident in the idealistic community of Vineland. Thatcher is enthralled by his next door neighbor Mary Treat — a real historical figure who was a scientist and correspondent to famous scientists like Charles Darwin and Asa Gray — and enraged by the supposed idealist societies’ resistance to teaching the theory of evolution. The modern timeline follows a family that has inherited a house on the brink of falling apart. While Willa and Iano believed that one day they would be able to live in comfort, they are instead taking care of their grandchild after the death of his mother and Iano’s ailing father, requiring help from both their children just to stay afloat. Although a close-knit family, there is a great deal of tension between them: Iano’s father, Nick, is a conservative with no regards for keeping his language politically correct, while Iano’s daughter, Tig is as liberal as they come with a disgust for the American Dream of acquiring wealth, and Zeke is a Harvard Business School graduate working for start-ups and finance companies.
A seasoned author, Kingsolver has an acute understanding of what it takes to write a great novel. The language is clear and precise. The dialogue is well-written and each character seems to have a style of speaking that matches their personalities perfectly. For instance, the millenial daughter Tig is well-spoken and full of radical ideas, but still manages to throw in a condescending “obvi” at the end of a few obvious points. Tig’s mother Willa has all the qualities of both a mother and ex-journalist, correcting everyone from her children to strangers on their grammar. Iano, Willa’s husband and a first-generation Greek immigrant, peppers his sentences with Greek metaphors and idioms.
Kingsolver has acutely drawn a parallel between two distinct, yet somehow similar, time periods. The debates between Christians who believed Darwin’s theory to be a sin against God and scientists who understood the value of the theory of evolution holds a tension similar to the tension today between Trump supporters and dissenters. Although never named, Trump’s run for presidency is clearly on the minds of both Kingsolver and her characters. Willa complains that her father-in-law “loves this billionaire running for president who’s never lifted a finger doing anything.” Just as Willa fights her father-in-law for what she believes to be completely outdated beliefs, Thatcher Greenwood fights the school principal and town leader to teach evolution in his classroom.
But sometimes the message gets a bit too didactic. Several times the family has political debates, or discusses the role of people like Zeke who work on Wall Street and seem to be in the business of making the rich richer. Tig lovingly takes care of Nick yet repeatedly condemns his conservative views, telling her mother, “There’s a lot of white folks out there hanging on to their God-given right to look down on some other class of people.” Although white herself, it becomes clear that Tig has a morbid long term hope for conservative, white Americans: Once all the older conservatives like her grandfather die, people like her can finally have the power to redirect the world to something better. Aside from this thought, many liberals reading this novel will agree with the arguments against the creationists in the early timeline and the conservatives in the present, but it’s unclear how this is beneficial. Anyone who disagrees with Kingsolver’s views will surely have abandoned the novel long ago after seeing the conservative character painted as a senile and angry old man, leaving only those who already agree with Kingsolver’s message.
A rumination on the post-2016 political climate and an excellent example of historical fiction, “Unsheltered” falters only in moments where its message is perhaps too clear. However, creationists and conservatives should beware, for Kingsolver does not look kindly upon you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Touting their exemption from the College’s sanctions against single-gender social organizations, four former sororities have partnered to sponsor a joint recruitment process for new members during the spring semester.
The groups — the Fleur-de-Lis, the Ivy, the Kali Praxi, and the Themis Asteri Club — all adopted gender-neutral membership policies in the years after administrators debuted the sanctions in spring 2016, and they subsequently received official recognition from the College and became Recognized Social Organizations. The clubs are inviting all Harvard undergraduates to participate in their recruitment activities, which start in early February.
The sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, captaining varsity athletic teams, and receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
Club leaders wrote in a statement posted on their recruitment website that students who join the groups will not incur negative consequences. The groups are “open to all students at Harvard who have completed at least one semester at the College,” according to a section of the website titled “New Beginnings.”
“These groups are gender-neutral and their members remain in good-faith compliance with College non-discrimination and social group policies,” the website reads. “In other words: no sanctions.”
The four groups’ joint recruitment push comes after interest in sorority recruitment dipped by more than half in 2018 — the first year the sanctions applied to some sorority hopefuls.
Members of the organizing committee spearheading the recruitment effort, which comprises leaders from the four social groups, wrote in an emailed statement that the groups decided to hold a joint recruitment so that prospective members could meet a variety of members from the different RSOs and choose the group that they most identify with.
“Joint recruitment is an important part of making groups diverse and inclusive because it gives all prospective members an equal opportunity to meet all four groups regardless of past connections,” the statement reads.
Margaret E. Reynolds ’20, president of the Ivy, said that the clubs are “trying to make it explicitly clear” that the sanctions don’t apply to their members and that she does not think fear of the penalties will deter students from signing up.
“You don't want to have to choose between your community and academic or career opportunities,” she said. “So we're doing everything in our power to not have to make someone make that decision.”
Reynolds said the groups have eliminated registration fees — which sororities had required when they held their joint recruitment — in an effort to increase accessibility.
Senior Director of Student Organizations and Resources at the Dean of Students Office Kate Colleran — who is advising the RSOs — wrote in an emailed statement that she is “very excited” about their joint recruitment. Though the DSO provided check-in discussions, financial resources, and spaces for recruitment events, Colleran wrote that the RSOs organized the joint recruitment strategy themselves.
“For some of the historically under-resourced RSOs, this is going to be a great way to pool their resources and members to have an impactful recruitment,” Colleran wrote. “I think it also shows the [teamwork] and communication that is going on within the RSOs as a larger group.”
Reynolds the recruitment process will consist of four rounds of activities over the course of eight days in February, including meet-and-greet social events with current club members, group outings involving excursions like ice skating, and one-on-one conversations between current and prospective members. Online registration for the joint recruitment events will close on Feb. 1.
Even as the former sororities work with the College to hold joint, gender-neutral recruitment, some single-gender groups continue to fight the sanctions.
National organizations for Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Alpha Phi, and a Delta Gamma management corporation — parent groups of the four former sororities that are now RSOs — are among the plaintiffs in a pair of lawsuits filed in state and federal court in December 2018 that allege the College’s policy is discriminatory, coercive, and unconstitutional. National organizations for fraternities Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi, Harvard’s chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and three anonymous undergraduates in all-male clubs also joined the legal action.
Ahead of those lawsuits, Harvard’s chapter of Alpha Phi — which had disaffiliated from its national organization and gone gender-neutral as the Ivy in August — reopened in November 2018, while the Ivy continued as a gender-neutral group. Eleven former Alpha Phi members have either rejoined the single-gender sorority or “expressed interest in rejoining,” according to the complaint filed in state court.
