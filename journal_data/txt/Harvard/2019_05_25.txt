After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When struggling actress Nina Wu (Wu Ke-Xi) gets her shot at a big role, there’s a caveat: The role requires full frontal nudity and explicit sex scenes. Out of obligation, her agent tells her not to do anything she’s not comfortable with, but after eight years in Taipei with only minor roles in commercials and short films, he makes it clear that this may be her last chance at a big break. She auditions for and gets the role, but only to be subsequently haunted by the humiliation and violence she endured in order to score the part. In a confusing amalgamation of flashbacks, nightmares, and visions, director Midi Z attempts to engage with the #MeToo movement, but relies on the sheer shock value of the abuse of power that ensues to ground the thriller. Without the developed perspective of the titular character, “Nina Wu” is less an exploration of how one might reconcile with their trauma, and more of an uncomfortably explicit depiction of the reality that many female actresses face in the filmmaking industry.
A familiar strain of exploitation inflicts the movie set for the ‘70s espionage film. The director (Shih Ming-Shuai) insists that everything must “look natural,” and he goes to extreme measures to make sure Nina lives up to the role. It takes nine tries for Nina to say one line exactly right, and he scolds her between each try. When they shoot the climactic moment of the film, he chokes and slaps her until she channels the uncontrolled anger he craves, thereby provoking and exploiting her real pain. While the actual sex scene isn’t depicted, Nina robotically practices a series of extreme positions that contort her body to please not one, but two men. But the ends justify the means, as the film’s success cements Nina Wu as an up-and-coming actress, and also masks the director’s questionable methods.
While Wu gives a forceful and emotional performance as Nina, Midi Z doesn’t quite develop her character. The plot itself includes a few too many detours: A side story involving an estranged friend back in her rural hometown only further confuses the plot, and interludes with her sickly mother and mentally ill father feel like time-consuming filler that only add stress to Nina’s life but do not have a narrative purpose. Midi Z does have a powerful command over the camera aesthetically, and sound editor Den Feng Li amplifies sounds — like a cockroach rattling or a gecko’s toes squeaking against a glass lamp — to cue viewers into Nina’s hyper-aware state of mind. Midi Z also crafts nightmares that attempt to reveal the inner depths of her psyche, but they’re too confusing and incoherent to piece together. All these little moments only provide a cursory look into Nina’s reconciliation with her traumatic experiences, both before and after the finale reveals what exactly that trauma entails.
Still, it’s brave of Midi Z to engage with the #MeToo dialogue at a place like Cannes, which has long served as the rendezvous for many since-implicated directors. But he can’t just rely on the subject’s boldness to carry it through, especially when he poses so many timely questions, namely: Is the patriarchal abuse of power just another inevitable reality of the filmmaking industry? It’s evident that Midi Z doesn’t have any answers to the questions he poses, which calls into question his motive for making the film. “Nina Wu” is ultimately more a vignette of corruption rather than an exploration of those actually harmed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
25 years after he won the Palme d’Or for “Pulp Fiction,” Quentin Tarantino is back at Cannes with his most recent film, “Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood.” It’s wonderfully nostalgic, from its throwback soundtrack and light-up signs to the pastel cars that skirt down the streets, and creates a fantastically detailed picture of the changing scene of 1969 Hollywood. With a few self-referential jokes thrown in the mix, the film is a lot of fun — with Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio together, how could it not be? — that is, if you can overlook the problematic gender and racial politics Tarantino perpetuates.
Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Rick Dalton, an actor past his prime, now dissatisfied and struggling to find meaning in his work. Living in his shadow is his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who drives Rick around Los Angeles to and from his sets. Next door to Rick resides the up-and-coming actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and her husband Roman Polanski (Rafał Zawierucha), both of whom were real victims of the Manson Family. Through Rick, Tarantino pays respects to actors who shaped their industry and defined an era through their careers: Rick’s agent Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino) runs Rick through some of his highlights in film, including a quintessentially Tarantino-esque scene of one of Rick’s characters blowing a flamethrower on a cohort of Nazis when he comes out of his hiding place behind curtains. A reference to “Inglourious Basterds,” this scene — and others throughout the rest of the film — makes Tarantino’s film as much about himself as it is about Rick Dalton, as Hollywood is facing yet another wave of change.
Tarantino attributes this change not to New Hollywood but to the new generation of hippies, who subscribe to free love, psychoactive drugs, and communal living. A particularly young and playful hippie, Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), catches Cliff’s eye multiple times as he cruises through the streets of L.A. running errands for Rick. Finally, the stars align for them and she hitches a ride in his car, leading him to her home on the Spahn Movie Ranch, where the Manson Family lives. The seemingly harmless teenagers digging through trash and parading around L.A. in earlier scenes of the film now give chills with their eerily piercing glares and smug expressions, living in a filth-ridden abandoned Western movie set. Even with the historical context of the heinous crimes of the Tate murders, Tarantino’s portrayal of the youth as a threatening and fearful force perhaps reflects a personal fear of the young and upcoming talent in Hollywood.
DiCaprio delivers a captivating performance as Rick, deftly switching between moments of passionate self-loathing and self-righteous arrogance. The scenes-within-scenes are as indulgent as they are enjoyable, and it’s easy to become invested in Dalton’s acting on set. Similarly well-cast is Pitt, who conveys a sly grin under his golden all-American smile, covering up a dark secret of his own. Tarantino endearingly shows both Rick and Sharon as actors who want to be appreciated and recognized: After Rick beats himself up for forgetting his lines on set, he returns to give a killer performance, which is both a testament to DiCaprio’s acting and Rick’s determined character. A young actress (Julia Butters) tells him, “That’s the best acting I’ve ever seen,” which is enough to make anyone (including Rick) tear up. Sharon also thrives on other people’s approval: When she watches her own film in a theater, she’s happily giddy when the audience chuckle at and cheer for her character.
Though Robbie does get some screen time, her lines are still far and few between. After a few too many slow motion body shots, it becomes increasingly clear that her character exists for visual appeal rather than any sort of depth, which is just one manifestation of the film's reductive representation of its female characters. Several lingering shots of the female characters’ bodies make clear that at its core, the film views the world through the male gaze. The most unnecessary is a scan (starting from foot to head) of a naked, sleeping Sharon Tate, which serves no narrative purpose, though there’s also an extended shot up Pussycat’s shorts while she’s leaning into Rick’s car. Tarantino isn’t shy about his enthusiasm for women’s feet, either: When Rick drives Pussycat home to Spahn Ranch, her dirty feet (because hippies always walk around barefoot, apparently) are pressed against the windshield the entire time. Sharon also puts her bare feet up on the theater seats in front of her while she watches her film. Tarantino is free to indulge in his fantasies on his own time — but in a film, which purports to give each character their full humanity regardless of gender, such attention reduces a woman to her physicality.
Also questionable is the film’s emasculating representation of Bruce Lee (Mike Moh), who challenges Cliff to a fight on set. After Bruce whimpers an exaggerated martial arts battle cry, Cliff swiftly hurls him into a car, making a body-sized dent and "defeating" him. This would-be comedic scene likely exists to demonstrate Cliff's mammoth physical strength, though it comes at the expense of Bruce Lee, one of the few athletic Asian figures that Western audiences recognize. This act of physical dominance then has deeper implications of emasculation and even colonialism, as a white man defeats someone from one of the many countries that the West has exoticized and othered.
If you’re expecting an entertaining and well-crafted film, Tarantino by all means delivers, and so does his stellar cast. But even compared to his older films, “Once Upon a Time” seems to cater even more to white male audiences than his other films, which is almost ironic considering that the current state of Hollywood continues to demand more diversity in the industry. This tension, of an otherwise exceptional film that fails to wholistically represent everyone involved, is perhaps telling of Tarantino’s philosophy of filmmaking: If he can make a damn good movie, who cares about anything else?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s Director’s Fortnight selection at Cannes included indie-flick “Give Me Liberty,” which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January to enthusiastic reviews. Directed by Kirill Mikhanovsky, “Give Me Liberty” follows a young Russian-American, man, Vic (Chris Galust), as he drives a van taking people with disabilities in Milwaukee. When he agrees to go out of his way to drive his grandfather’s friends to a funeral, his day takes an unfortunate turn, leading to a series of comical mishaps. Along the way, he also picks up Tracy (Lauren “Lolo” Spencer), a young woman with ALS who uses a wheelchair to get around.
Mikhanovsky’s first feature, “Sonhos De Peixe,” premiered at Cannes Critics’ Week in 2006 and won the Prix Regard Jeunes. This time, Mikhanovsky co-wrote the screenplay with Alice Austen, a 1988 graduate from Harvard Law School who also studied under the famed poet Seamus Heaney in the Creative Writing Program at Harvard. This is her first feature film, but as a playwright, she’s received residencies and commissions from the Royal Court in London, the Goodman Theatre, Steppenwolf, and Chicago Dramatists. It was through a mutual friend that she met Mikhanovsky, and from there a budding collaboration formed. When Mikhanovsky came to Milwaukee from Russia, one of his first jobs was driving to transport people with disabilities. Austen, who’s also based in Milwaukee, said she saw the stories Mikhanovsky as a way to explore the problems and disconnect faced by the people in her city.
“I said, you know, this would be an amazing jumping off point for a film about the most segregated city in the country because these drivers traverse the whole city, and a lot of people don’t cross the line,” Austen said. “Milwaukee is really almost a red-line city in a way.”
The film’s cast, consisting of an eclectic mix of street-cast actors and international stars, experienced a number of “firsts” in making “Give Me Liberty.” Maksim Stoyanov, who plays Dima, the deceased woman’s nephew who becomes Vic’s right-hand man in the driving misadventures, is an established actor in Russia, though “Give Me Liberty” is his first film in the States. And though they’re both Russian, Stoyanov said Mikhanovsky’s style of directing is very different than that of directors Stoyanov’s worked with before.
“I have never interacted with a more self-assured and erudite person,” Stoyanov said of Mikhanovsky. “But he’s really incredible.”
On the other hand, Spencer and Galust are first-timers to the screen, and leading man Galust, an electrician by trade, was spotted through a street casting agency in New York while he was at a corner store running errands.
“The rule is, you know, be careful when you go buy a cake for your grandfather,” Galust said.
Austen said the crew raked through hundreds and hundreds of auditions searching for the right actors. The role of Tracy was particularly important because the other disabled characters in the film were all played by disabled actors.
“We had two actors who wanted to play the part of Tracy that Lolo plays. And they didn't have a disability and we thought that would be a disservice to the other characters in the film who are disabled people,” Austen said. “So we stuck to our guns, and also Lola was obviously perfect, she's brilliant.”
For Spencer, Tracy both embodies and defies the disability stereotype. Spencer, who has ALS and uses a wheelchair for her primary ambulatory needs, said able-bodied people often are intimidated when interacting with people with disabilities.
“Tracy's very unexpected. I think there's this perception of people with disabilities and how they should respond to things, how they need to handle themselves or defend themselves in situations. And Tracy's complete opposite that perception of people with disabilities having to be probably timid, or you have to be careful and scared,” Spencer said. “She doesn't take nothing from nobody. She’s unafraid. She's fearless in so many ways. But it's still very vulnerable, but she's fearless in her vulnerability.”
Spencer recalls the first being thrown in the first day of shooting, filming an incredibly tense and chaotic scene of Tracy and Vic yelling at each other in the van, crowded with all the other passengers, as he’s speeding down the streets. On top of the literal bumps in the road, the cast and crew faced the brutal winter cold, which Galust found especially trying.
“The most difficult thing for me — I don’t know, I wouldn’t use the word difficult, it was just really different — was knowing that there’s a van full of elderly people that are dealing with the cold, trying to pay attention to them, making sure that they’re okay,” Galust said.
In a way, Austen said Galust’s concern for other cast and crew members during shooting was a parallel to his character Vic’s heart of gold. Upon hearing this, Spencer and Steyanov both laughed and nodded in agreement.
Austen said the “Give Me Liberty” team also faced a wave of challenges in the early days of production to secure finances. The deal with the first producing partners, with whom Mikhanovsky and Austen had built a relationship for over a year, fell through. Unbeknownst to Stoyanov at the time, the film was still unfinanced when he flew out to New York from Moscow —  it was not until the day after he arrived that the first round of financing came out.
Wild Bunch has the distribution rights for the film in Europe, where it will be released on July 25, starting with Russia. Earlier this month, U.S. distributor Music Box Films acquired the film, and “Give Me Liberty” is slated to hit American theatres by late summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the eve of the secret departure of Italian mafia boss Tommaso Buscetta (Pierfrancesco Favino), he tells his long-time friend and fellow mafia member Giuseppe “Pippo” Calò (Fabrizio Ferracane) to look after his sons. He departs for Brazil, hoping to start a peaceful life with his new wife Cristina (Maria Fernanda Cândido). So begins Marco Bellocchio’s “Il Traditore” (“The Traitor”), a look into the life of one of the first informants from the Italian mafia who helped indict hundreds of mafia members. Grounded in the Maxi Trial of 1986, the largest anti-mafia trial in history, Bellocchio strays from some historical details, creating an at first enrapturing but ultimately superficial and overextended look into Buscetta’s experiences.
Things back in Italy go awry for Buscetta when he receives news of numerous deaths of his former colleagues and — more upsettingly — his sons, and is unable to reach Pippo. Bellocchio cuts to scenes of the murders, with a ticking bodycount on the bottom corner of the screen. The Brazilian state police soon catch Buscetta and he’s taken to prison, where he’s tortured for information and eventually handed back to the Italian government. In a crucial turn in history, Buscetta becomes one of the first prominent figures in the mafia to turn informant, giving the state vital and secretive information about his group, Cosa Nostra, which literally translates to “Our Thing” in English (as Busetta explains, that’s what all the members call it, because “The Mafia doesn’t exist. It’s an invention of the press”).
As Buscetta stays imprisoned in Italy, he’s questioned by Judge Giovanni Falcone (Russo Alesi), whom he slowly grows to trust. This delicate yet vital relationship plays an enthralling part in the Maxi Trials, one that Bellocchio disappointingly spends little time exploring. Favino delivers a charismatic and captivating performance as Buscetta throughout the film. From his anguish at the loss of his sons to his fury at those who betrayed him, from his lustful passion for Cristina to his seemingly indifferent resignation in becoming an informant, Favino convincingly commands an intense range of emotions. And when he utters unflinchingly, “I’m not scared of dying, I’m not scared of anything,” it really seems as if he isn’t. His one wish? “To die in my bed.”
Favino’s engaging acting, however, is not enough to create an in-depth look into Buscetta’s character. Bellochio, deftly aware of the political webs he’s playing with through this story, observes most of the other figures from a safe distance. Bellochio vacillates between showing two sides of Buscetta: a womanizing old-time sly mafia member mainly cooperating because he’s left with no choice, and a deeply loyal but vengeful father seeking revenge against those who killed his friends and family. In this way, the audience knows Buscetta is a complicated character, yet Bellochio never gives genuine insight into Buscetta’s exact incentives for supposedly betraying Cosa Nostra.
In one of the best rapid-fire dialogue exchanges at Cannesusi, Buscetta and Calo ruthlessly chew each other out in a cross-examination. The dramatic score of string instruments (Nicola Piovani compiles an excellent soundtrack) gives the scene an operatic effect, and complete with the mafia mobsters in cages around the courthouse and disorder everywhere, Bellocchio creates a scene resembling a zoo more than it does a courthouse, and a hilarious one at that. Cross-examination aside, Favino carries on most of the court scenes with a deadpan expression that conceals his thoughts. Though successful at maintaining a composed presence — a performance that contrasts with Luigi Lo Cascio’s portrayal of Busetta’s old ally, the comically engaging Totuccio Contorno, who fervently talks back to the caged mobsters in the courthouse — Bellocchio’s portrayal here again deprives viewers of understanding Buscetta’s motivations for giving testimonies to the state, and whether he foresaw the eventual impact it would have on Cosa Nostra. As enticing as the court scenes are, after a few rounds, Bellocchio gets bogged down in the technicalities of the legal procedures and they start to lose their fresh appeal and comic edge. Again, the time would’ve better spent developing dialogue between Falcone and Buscetta, who takes a backseat as soon as the trial begins, only to never appear again in the film except for a brief farewell scene when Buscetta leaves Italy for the United States under the Witness Protection Program.
Perhaps Bellocchio attempts to stay true to the machismo espoused in the Cosa Nostra circles, but his dismissal of female characters in the film is disappointing. Even Francis Ford Coppoola gave more agency to he female characters in “The Godfather” (which was released over 40 years ago), and with this year’s festival so heavily publicizing equal representation, Bellochio seems to be clueless of (or indifferent to) the cultural movement. The women — sisters, wives, especially Cristina — are seen mostly as sexual objects, as Bellocchio shows a phone call where Cristina masturbates over the phone to a saudade Buscetta, who’s in jail, as one of the determining factors for Buscetta’s decision to become an informant. Even Buscetta’s sincere declaration that families are “untouchables” to Cosa Nostra is reductive: Just as much as women are protected, they’re also prevented from having any agency or control in family matters, only seen as powerless victims and pawns in the game left to deal with the dire consequences of the men’s actions.
Unfortunately, the film goes about 40 minutes too long. Where a natural ending point to the film could’ve been, Bellocchio takes us back into Buscetta’s life, for reasons unclear, as the film recounts historical events in his life without revealing what his earlier incentives were. If anything, Buscetta becomes a more muddled character in result. Even though Bellocchio romanticizes the old Cosa Nostra and Buscetta’s honor to it, “Il Traditore” is a mesmerizing story of crime and betrayal and amusing court scenes — until it’s not.
