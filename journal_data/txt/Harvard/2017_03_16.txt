After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following an undefeated start to the season, the Harvard baseball team traveled to Florida for Spring Break, where the team is scheduled to play 10 games in the span of nine days. First up on the team’s road trip was a stop at Sessions Stadium and a four-game set against RPI 53rd-ranked Jacksonville—an early-season assessment against a quality ASUN-conference team.
Despite splitting the first two games, the Crimson saw early slim leads slip away in both the next two matches and ultimately dropped three of four to the Dolphins (9-9). Quality Harvard pitching against strong Dolphin bats was tempered by silent offensive offerings in the last two games, developments that are both exciting and worrisome for the Crimson moving forward.
Harvard now sits at 5-3 and take on Bucknell and Massachusetts before playing four against a streaking South Florida team to close out Spring Break.
“The team did a good job of competing, for the most part,” said sophomore pitcher Kevin Stone, who started the Crimson’s Saturday morning victory. “It was a good test for us to get down here and play against some of the better competition in the country.”
JACKSONVILLE 5, HARVARD 3
The scoreboard after the top of the fourth inning of Sunday’s series-ending game provided a glimpse into a strange scenario: despite having zero hits on the board, Harvard held a 3-0 lead over Jacksonville.
A combination of walks, hit-by-pitches, and errors afforded the Crimson the early lead, but a subsequent shutdown effort out of the home bullpen propelled the Dolphins to a 5-3 comeback win.
Three Dolphins pitchers combined to no-hit Harvard until the seventh inning, when Crimson sophomore Ben Skinner broke it up with a single down the right field line. Jacksonville junior Matt Meyer pitched a solid 4.1 relief innings for starter Nathan Disch, who, despite giving up no hits, was pulled after just two outs in the first inning. Jacksonville went on to tally two in the fourth and two in the sixth, adding one more in the bottom of the seventh, to wrest the lead away from Harvard.
Junior Noah Zavolas got the loss despite striking out four and giving up just two earned runs over seven innings. Zavolas’ quality start was slightly marred by two Crimson errors behind him, helping three unearned Jacksonville runs cross the plate. In addition, Skinner’s single would prove to be Harvard’s only knock all game.
“With the exception of the Friday night game, our pitchers were really competitive and threw a lot of strikes, and that’s what we needed,” said senior catcher and captain Josh Ellis. “Unfortunately, our bats were a little silent in the last two games, and that’s where we got caught up.”
JACKSONVILLE 2, HARVARD 1 (8 INNINGS)
The tail end of Saturday’s double-header, a scheduled seven-inning affair, was forced into an extra eighth inning after Jacksonville erased a first-inning 1-0 deficit with an RBI groundout in the fifth. In the bottom of the eighth, with runners on first and second, Dolphins sophomore Angel Camacho hit a two-out walk-off RBI single, sinking the Crimson, 2-1.
Harvard junior righty Ian Miller took on an unfortunate loss after keeping the Crimson in the game all game long. Miller pitched a complete, 7.2 inning, two-earned-run game with three strikeouts, continuing to impress as a starter after his complete nine-inning game gem in his first start.
In the second inning, Harvard struck first after sophomore Trent Bryan singled home junior Matt Rothenberg. Bryan’s 2-for-3 day at the plate capped off a 4-for-7 Saturday, though he would be hitless on Friday and Sunday.
HARVARD 4, JACKSONVILLE 1
In the doubleheader opener, Stone and freshman righty Kieran Shaw helped the Crimson pull off a 4-1 win on Saturday morning to tie the series at 1-1. The pair of young pitchers combined to hold Jacksonville to just one run over nine innings of work, with Stone getting the win and Shaw the save.
“The MO for myself and Kieran was just to compete our butts off,” Stone said. “We tried to put our team, and keep our team, in a position to win that ballgame after we scored four runs to start the game.”
The solid appearances against a quality team are big for both pitchers. They’ll look to take the positive experience back up north as the season progresses.
Sophomore outfielders Patrick Robinson and John MacLean punched in an RBI apiece for Harvard, while Bryan went 2-for-4 at the dish with a ninth-inning insurance home run. Junior John Fallon also went 2-for-4 with two runs scored.
“It was great to get down there and size ourselves up against those guys,” Stone said. “I think it showed us that we can really play with anybody, taking a game from them and being competitive in those last two games.”
JACKSONVILLE 12, HARVARD 1
Jacksonville walked all over the Crimson in the series-opening Friday night game under the lights, as the home team pounded out 14 hits and scored in each of the first five frames to make the game 10-0 before Harvard even started batting its third time through.
“It’s always pretty humbling to go down to these schools,” Ellis said. “Unfortunately, we just weren’t ready to go. We just didn’t put things together Friday night.”
Sophomore righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson took the loss for the Crimson, being pulled in the fourth after giving up six earned runs. First baseman/pitcher Matt Hink and even Fallon, an infielder, made appearances on the mound, to save the rest of the bullpen arms during the one-sided affair.
Leadoff hitter Quinn Hoffman went 2-for-4, with two stolen bases during the game, though his performance would drop off with a subsequent 0-for-11 in the next three games.
“Our coach brought us together, and we rallied around that,” Ellis said. “[We knew] we could come together and put our best foot forward the next day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard baseball is already making improvements where it needs to.
After lackluster offensive showings over the weekend against Jacksonville, the Crimson turned it around on Tuesday and Wednesday in Port Charlotte, Fl. The team hit balls hard, found gaps, and ultimately produced a season-high 15 hits against Bucknell and 11 more knocks against Massachusetts.
Combined with continued rock-solid starting pitching, the improved results at the plate translated to 9-8 and 8-2 Harvard wins, respectively, over the New Jersey-based Bison (6-6) and in-state rival Minutemen (3-5). The Crimson’s Tuesday victory over Bucknell also snapped the Bison’s three-game winning streak.
“It was exactly what we needed,” said senior catcher and captain Josh Ellis. “We got silenced against Jacksonville, so it was nice to decompress, have that team practice day, and next you thing you know, to come out charging… [and have] an offensive outburst.”
Harvard (7-3) now gets another rest day before taking on RPI 35th-ranked South Florida in Tampa, Fl. in a four-game series.
HARVARD 8, MASSACHUSETTS 2
Sophomore catcher Jake Allen’s big day at the plate set the stage for eight unanswered runs for the Crimson and an 8-2 win over Massachusetts.
Allen went 3-for-4 and drove in three runs on a tie-breaking two-RBI double in the fourth and an RBI single in the sixth. The Charlottesville, VA. native also scored twice. All three stat lines—hits, RBI’s, and runs scored—were career highs for the sophomore.
“To start the season off, I felt like I was seeing the ball well, my timing was good, everything was there—it just wasn’t clicking for me yet,” Allen said. “Today was the day where I think it started to come together for me.”
Sophomore Trent Bryan tied the game at two apiece in the third with a double that brought home freshman Quinn Hoffman and Allen. Bryan is now batting .400 on the season and has a .760 slugging percentage, helped by a team-high two triples.
On the mound, freshman righty Hunter Bigge made his first start and posted his first W, striking out three and giving up two earned runs over six innings of work. The freshman’s solid outing continues a trend of quality starts by Harvard starting pitching.
Bigge, did, however, have to deal with a two-run first inning in which Massachusetts sent nine men to the plate. The Crimson’s early 2-0 deficit, however, did nothing to shake the team’s confidence.
“The first inning was a little shaky, but after he got past that, he came in and threw a lot of strikes,” said Allen, who got the start behind the plate. “Overall, he did great. He put together a pretty good performance for his first start.”
Sophomore Kevin Stone and junior Ian Miller, who have both made starts this season, made appearances out of the bullpen, shutting down the Minutemen in the seventh and eighth after Bigge’s exit.
HARVARD 9, BUCKNELL 8
Harvard once again faced an early deficit in Tuesday’s day game against Bucknell, but the ensuing offensive shootout turned out in the Crimson’s favor in a 9-8 win over the Bison.
The catcher position once again played a pivotal role for the offense, as Ellis’s bat came alive to a resounding effect. The team captain went 3-for-4 with two RBI’s and a run scored. Ellis also punched in an RBI single in the top of the ninth that drove in two important insurance runs.
“It’s always frustrating when you can’t really contribute to the offense,” Ellis said, speaking on the start to his season. “It was good seeing the ball, swing felt good, putting two and two together, and find some gaps.”
Ellis’s RBIs would become important in a wild ninth inning, as Harvard scored thrice in the top half to extend its lead to 9-4, but Bucknell made a bid for a comeback with four runs in the bottom half.
After junior Garrett Rupp left after 2.2 innings of relief work, freshman Kieran Shaw put an end to things by getting the last two outs of the game. However, it wasn’t the cleanest, as the Bison got four singles, two walks, and two wild pitches in the final frame, accounting for their four runs. Only a two-out flyout ended the game.
Freshman righty Grant Stone was the beneficiary of the Crimson’s 15-hit outburst, as he pitched 5.2 innings of four-run ball, with one run being unearned. Though Stone has made appearances out of the bullpen this season, Wednesday marked his first start and first win.
Harvard got contributions across the lineup, as freshman Chad Minato and Bryan, in addition to Ellis, picked up three hits apiece. Senior Drew Reid, after a similarly trying start to the season, drove in a game-high three runs, and sophomore first baseman Patrick McColl drove in two more.
The Bison’s early 1-0 and 3-2 leads did little to throw the Crimson off.
“Our innings have been tricky; we’ll hit the ball hard, but it’ll go right at someone,” Ellis explained. “On paper, that’s an out, but our hitters are still seeing the ball well, and it’s just a matter of finding those holes—which, if you’re hitting the ball, is going to happen. For us, it’s just focusing on playing our game, competing, and trusting in what we’ve done. It’s relaxing and playing our game.”
Sophomore Patrick Robinson, Bryan, and Minato jumpstarted Harvard’s four-run sixth that took the lead for good by getting on base, and Reid did most of the damage with a bases-clearing double through the left side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team scored 14 goals in total as it hung on to beat Yale by a single point. On Saturday, 14 points was the Crimson’s margin of victory.
For the first five minutes, Harvard’s game against Siena on Saturday looked like it would be a repetition of last week’s back-and-forth contest. The Saints found the back of the Crimson net less than 30 seconds after the opening whistle, only to see Harvard equalize within a minute through a goal from junior attacker Eliza Guild. It took Siena just 44 seconds to retake the lead, but senior attacker Marisa Romeo slammed a free position shot into the top corner five minutes into the period to pull the Crimson even once again.
After Romeo’s game-tying score, the tone of the matchup changed. Harvard notched four unanswered scores in ten minutes, and by the halfway point of the first stanza, the Crimson had tallied six points—the same number that the Saints would manage for the entire game.
In the end, Harvard’s red-hot offense, ranked top-10 nationally, made sure that Saturday’s contest didn’t mirror last week’s close game. The final score was 20-6 as the Crimson (3-1,  1-0 Ivy League) routed Siena (1-4) at Harvard Stadium.
“It was an all around great team win,” tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon said.
The four goals that put Harvard ahead for good came from the same number of players, reflecting the team-wide nature of a win in which 13 Crimson players scored.
“We had a game plan and everyone stuck to it,” junior midfielder Julia Glynn said. “No matter who was on the field, we played together, adapted to the defense, and had fun.”
Tri-captain midfielder Megan Hennessey started the Harvard scoring run with the Crimson’s third goal of the game and her third of the season. Sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee was up next, finishing off an assist from junior midfielder Nekele McCall, before Romeo and sophomore attacker Nicole Baiocco each converted a free position chance to hand Harvard a 6-2 lead.
The Crimson was devastatingly efficient in free position shots throughout the game, scoring on every one of its four opportunities, while Siena went two-for-six in the same category.
Harvard also topped Siena in every other attacking statistic. The Crimson picked up 17 ground balls to the Saints’ nine and won 20 of 27 draw controls over the course of the game. Harvard also fired off more than three times as many shots as its opponent, taking 44, while Siena managed 14.
The disparate shot totals reflected the Crimson’s dominance in both offense and defense.
Harvard’s attacking prowess was highlighted by Romeo and MacAfee, who combined for 12 of the Crimson’s efforts on frame. The two rank seventh and 39th in the nation, respectively, for goals per game. The pair also matched Siena’s goal total for the contest between them, with Romeo scoring four times and MacAfee finding the back of the net twice.
Harvard’s defense also put in a commanding performance, limiting Siena to just four shots in the second half, its lowest total for a single period this season.
Despite the Crimson’s strong showing on defense, the Saints managed to collect two more goals in the first stanza with a third score from Romeo in the middle to settle the game at 7-4.
Harvard made sure that it entered the break having taken back all the momentum, though. The Crimson scored five unanswered goals in the final seven minutes of the half to close out the opening stanza with an eight-point lead.
McMahon kicked off the scoring run with a pair of finishes, converting a lobbed assist from sophomore midfielder Caroline Garrity and then beating a defender with a spin dodge and sneaking an underhanded shot past the Siena goalie.
Glynn added to the scoring, finishing off of a pass from MacAfee with 1:08 left in the half to extend Harvard’s margin to six points.
MacAfee would get her second goal of the night with just 16 seconds left on the clock—but not before senior defender Marina Burke cut in front of goal and found the back of the net from close range.
The Crimson showed no signs of slowing down after the restart, pulling even further away from the Saints with six goals in a row.
Glynn and Guild would each pick up a second score of the game in the second half, and junior attacker Caroline Ashford got in on the act, smashing home a shot from close range. Sophomore midfielder Ali Thaler also collected up her first goal of the year, and freshman Katie Muldoon midfielder Katie Muldoon continued a strong rookie season, picking out the top corner from distance.
Romeo rounded out the scoring run, picking up her fourth goal of the game and 14th of the season. This weekend’s contest marked the third time in four games this year that the senior has scored four or more goals.
Siena picked up two quick goals at the end of the second period to bring the score to 18-6.
It fell to two freshmen to crush any chance of a Saints comeback and put the game to bed, after the bulk of the scoring on the day came from upperclassmen.
First, rookie attacker Julia DiNovi beat a defender with a feint before finding the bottom corner of the net. Not to be outdone, classmate and midfielder Bridget Flynn outpaced a Siena player and slammed an overhand shot past the Saints goalie with 17 seconds remaining in the game to seal the 14-score difference.
“I think the team played great today,” Romeo said. “It was a great team win, and everyone contributed. We are really excited coming off of this win and going into our big game versus Ohio State on Monday.”
