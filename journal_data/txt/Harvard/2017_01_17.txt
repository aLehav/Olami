After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As we hobble into a Trump presidency, many of my friends have wondered how they will fare in the next four years. Undocumented students have rallied across campus, and women are marching on Washington in anticipation of a dismal future. There has been a burgeoning reflection of identity among me and my friends. Some of us have never felt so aware of our race, gender, religion, sexuality, and citizenship status. In the midst of this introspection, I want to bring up a part of my identity that often gets lost in these politicized struggles. I am wondering what role Asian-Americans can play in the next four years of American politics.
While I imagine more organization and political mobilization in the future, Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) civic participation has been discouraging at best for the past couple decades. The racial group has historically had some of the lowest voter turnout rates, and in 2014 nearly half considered themselves to be politically independent. Yet Asian-Americans are currently the fastest-growing racial group in the United States. For some, these characteristics may only reinforce stereotypes of the “apolitical” Asian-American, but within this voting vacuum, I see a great realm of opportunity for political action. It seems that now more than ever, the uncertain future of Asian-American politics calls for more collective action.
At this point, Asian-Americans are still developing their political identities and values. To give a sense of the malleability of the Asian-American bloc’s current political state, there has been a dramatic shift from Republican to Democratic political alignment in Asian American voters just in the past couple election cycles. Some think that Trump himself may have encouraged this trend. In The New York Times, one reporter writes, “Mr. Trump’s talk of deporting millions of undocumented immigrants has also stirred up painful memories among a group that has been singled out under American law before, whether by the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred the immigration of Chinese laborers until 1943, or by the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.”
The push against Trump offers hope that Asian-Americans will see their own proximity to the controversial issues that so many other groups are visibly fighting today. For example, Asian-Americans are the fastest-growing group of undocumented immigrants, now surpassing immigrants from Latin America. When politicians invoked Japanese internment camps as a “precedent” for a Muslim registry, Asian Americans Advancing Justice condemned this rhetoric, pointing out the extremist discrimination faced by Japanese-Americans during those times. Furthermore, Asian-Americans saw some of the biggest gains in health insurance coverage after the Affordable Care Act reduced health disparities stemming from historical barriers.
Asian-Americans need to see that immigration issues are Asian-American issues. Anti-Muslim rhetoric is an Asian-American issue. Repealing affordable health care is an Asian-American issue.
Key to the formation of Asian-American political identity is our own generation—the millennial generation—so I hope to see Asian-American students at Harvard take account of their proximity to these issues. We must continue to fight back against these attacks that our community now faces under the current political climate.
Because Asian-American students at Harvard often feel trivialized for their activism, I tend to see them left out of conversations that tackle the politics of identity and marginalization. The model minority myth and the diverse nature of the AAPI community particularly create a complicated role for Asian-Americans in activist spaces on campus. While I don’t advocate for the AAPI agenda at the expense of movements such as Black Lives Matter and Brown Lives Matter, it has the potential to enrich the discussion, especially if AAPI groups show more solidarity with these causes in the future.
By labelling immigration, Muslim, and and health care issues as “Asian-American” issues, I hope Harvard’s large AAPI community can connect these broader struggles to their own backgrounds. AAPIs represent around 24 percent of Harvard’s population. We have the numbers to make a difference. Now is the time to make it count.

To our readers:
Today marks the first paper of The Crimson’s 144th year, and as we start the presses anew for 2017, we wanted to give you an update on where we’re headed.
In today’s world, journalism seems to be increasingly up for grabs: its role, its contribution, and most gravely, its impact. Some may see a daily newspaper as a quaint throwback to an older time, and our readers certainly stay abreast with events in ways The Crimson’s first guard, writing in 1873, could hardly have imagined.
We do not pretend to have the answers to these challenges, many of which have national or global implications. Instead, we want to focus on doing what we believe we can do best: informing and educating Harvard and Cambridge.
We are huge believers, unsurprisingly, in the importance of the press. We believe that a less informed campus would be a poorer one, an unquestioned administration a less successful one. At an institution dedicated to education and knowledge about the wider world, journalism about our neck of the woods should matter greatly.
Our aim, as always, is to bring you timely, high-quality, and accurate journalism. We’re investing in investigative and enterprise reporting, continuing to hone our writing, and working to ensure that we’re first—and right—when news breaks.
We also know that news is so much more than our articles. We’re doubling down on multimedia, design, and technology to present our content in new and innovative ways. We’re constantly reassessing how we can better reach you, whether via email, social media, the website, or the print paper. And we’re committed to making sure that our editorial page remains the best forum for Harvard affiliates to sound off on the issues that matter.
These goals are made more challenging by squeezed budgets, a trend at media outlets nationwide to which The Crimson is not immune. Nevertheless, we are proud of the work that our business department does each day to make possible our educational and journalistic mission. Our promise to you is to never subordinate our journalism to our finances.
We’re indebted to those who’ve come before, showing us the ropes, forgiving our mistakes, and putting up with us in general over the past several years. They ought to be proud of The Crimson’s successes.
At the same time, today’s paper, like the many to come this year, would not be possible without more than 300 remarkably talented Crimeds who now take the helm. We are deeply thankful to our classmates who volunteer their time and their energy to make this place tick, pitching advertisements, writing articles, and sometimes just hanging around. In particular, to our friends on the masthead, thank you for doing this crazy thing with us.
We think we speak for most in saying that The Crimson is unique, and this year, it is our priority to make sure that this building can be that for all Harvard students, no matter who they are or from where they came.
At a student newspaper, every day is an all-hands-on-deck day, and so we need the best talent we can find. But diversity in our newsroom, our business offices, and our leadership isn’t just good for the quality of our journalism and the stability of our finances—though needed there it is. Simply, diversity is good because it’s right.
Most importantly, a newspaper cannot happen without readers. We encourage you to let us know when you think we err, and we ask for another year of your readership and faith. The Crimson’s first issue, printed on January 24, 1873, proudly declared, “I will be read.” Our job is to once again turn that promise into reality, earning your confidence as well as your time, and always being keenly aware that 144 years of trust are no sure guarantee of the next 12 months.
Thank you to our readers, our colleagues, and our friends—we couldn’t do it without you.
Keep the old sheet flying,
Derek K. Choi ’18

Students using Harvard and MIT’s edX courses take significantly less time to complete the online programs than students enrolled in the equivalent on-campus classes do, a wide-ranging report on the virtual education platform found.
The report, published last month, aims to evaluate edX and its Massive Online Open Courses four years after the platform’s debut. Launched with fanfare in 2012, edX aims to make course material from Harvard and MIT available thousands of students online.
While edX course access is free, participants have the option to pay a fee for a certificate of mastery after completing a course.
According to the report, described as “one of the largest surveys of MOOCs to date,” 2.4 million “unique users” around the world have participated in an edX class. Of those users, 159,000 have earned at least one certificate.
Andrew D. Ho, a co-author of the report and a professor at the Graduate School of Education, said the research was intended to make the progress and shortcomings of the edX platform “transparent.”
The report details disparities between on-campus courses, or “residential courses,” and online ones—namely that students spend considerably more time on standard classroom-based courses. Most online certificate earners spend less than 50 hours completing a course, and one percent of certificate earners get certificates with “less than 23 minutes online,” according to the report. Researchers estimated that the average semester-long residential course takes approximately 168 hours, or 12 hours per week.
“There still is a way in which this report reminds you how heterogenous [edX] still is,” Ho said. “The punchline is there’s no physical classroom like this in the world.”
Isaac Chuang, a co-author of the report and a professor of physics and electrical engineering at MIT, said that students taking online courses may learn more efficiently. Some of the methods used in online teaching—such as the “flipped classroom,” where students view online lectures and work on problems in class—will likely be adopted for residential courses at Harvard and MIT, Chuang said.
“We are taking these materials that were generated for MOOCs to supplement and change the balance of teaching on campus,” Chuang said.
Ho, however, said that the efficiency of online courses may also show that there is something missing from an online class that happens in a residential one.
EdX certificate earners come disproportionately from more educated and developed countries, according to the report. Chuang and Ho found that of the 245,000 edX certificates that have been issued since the platform’s launch in 2012, most have been awarded to users from countries with high values on the Human Development Index, a “a country-level composite of life expectancy, education, and income  indicators.”
While the report describes the correlation between development levels and edX certification, some outliers remain: Rwanda, for example, a country that ranks among the lowest on the development index, has a remarkably high certification rate. The report cites a 2014 partnership between Facebook and edX in Rwanda as a possible reason for the certification rate in the country.
According to the report, 71 percent of edX users are from countries outside of the United States. The median user age is 29, and 73 percent of users hold Bachelor’s degrees.
The researchers also found evidence of a gender gap in enrollment for computer science and STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—edX courses, which are on average comprised of 17 and 16 percent women, respectively. By comparison, humanities courses are on average 47 percent female, and social sciences courses are roughly 35 percent female.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 18, 2017 at 10:43 a.m.
After receiving a “failing” grade from the U.S. Department of Education for saddling students with high levels of debt, Harvard’s American Repertory Theater Institute—a graduate dramaturgy, acting, and voice instruction program—has frozen its admissions for fall 2017.
The Department of Education released a list of hundreds of colleges and universities that failed federal standards for student debt last week, putting the programs at risk of losing taxpayer-funded financial aid from the government. The A.R.T. Institute, a two-year program which admits roughly 23 students per year, was one of few nonprofit institutions to receive a failing grade: 98 percent of the failing schools were for-profit.
University spokesperson David Cameron wrote in an emailed statement that the A.R.T Institute will put a “temporary pause” on the program, and will not enroll a class of 2019 due to the “uncertainty surrounding the availability of federal aid for prospective students.”
“This temporary pause on the two-year master’s program does not affect the students currently enrolled in the acting, dramaturgy, and voice programs,” Cameron wrote. “Rather, it enables the A.R.T. to evaluate the program and undertake vital strategic planning to address, among other things, student funding mechanisms.”
To identify “failing” schools, the Department of Education calculated two metrics: the average annual amount of money graduates spend on loan payments, and graduates’ average earnings in the job market two years after graduation. Together, these metrics were used to calculate the “debt-to-earnings ratio” of a program’s graduates.
The discretionary “debt-to-earnings ratio” of the A.R.T. Institute’s graduates is 44 percent, meaning that graduates must pay 44 percent of their income in order to cover the minimum loan payment after accounting for basic expenses. Under federal rules, that ratio must be under 20 percent for a program to receive a passing grade.
Two years of tuition at the A.R.T. Institute costs $62,593. The Department of Education estimated that A.R.T. Institute graduates earn, on average, around $36,000 per year.
An initiative of the Obama administration, the Department of Education’s investigation was intended to crack down on for-profit programs with predatory loan practices: institutions including ITT Tech and the University of Phoenix also received failing grades.
The A.R.T. Institute, however, fell under the department’s scrutiny due to a particularity in the federal regulation. In its investigation, the DOE examined for-profit universities as well as degree programs that award “certificates,” instead of traditional master’s degrees. Upon graduation, A.R.T. Institute students are awarded a “Master of Liberal Arts Degree in Extension Studies” and a “Certificate of Achievement from the faculty of the Moscow Art Theater School.”
Federal financial aid is the largest source of student financial aid in the United States and is provided for by the Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid office.

UPDATED: January 18, 2017 at 2:17 p.m. 
When eligible Harvard students went to the polls in November to vote on whether or not they should form a union, union organizers had several reasons to be optimistic.
First, in February 2016, more than 60 percent of graduate students employed by the University had signed authorization cards supporting a union election, indicating significant student interest in unionization.
Then, in August, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that student employees at private universities could form unions, opening a legal pathway for eligible students at Harvard.
And finally, a few weeks after the election at Harvard, eligible students at Columbia voted overwhelmingly in favor of forming a union, setting a precedent for a successful student unionization effort at an Ivy League university.
But an initial vote conducted in December after weeks of delay showed that majority of counted ballots in Harvard’s election were not in favor of unionization. While the results of the election are not final—the NLRB will hold hearings to decide which of 314 remaining challenged ballots should be counted on Feb. 21—1,456 of the tallied ballots oppose unionization, while 1,272 support it.
For many students on both sides of the unionization question, this initial vote count and the stalled progress of the unionization effort is surprising. Between the unionization effort’s campaign to win votes, Harvard's initiatives to oppose unionization, and divisions between graduate students in the sciences and engineering and graduate students in the humanities, students say a variety of factors contributed to the unexpected outcome.
“I was honestly pretty surprised,” said John Froberg, a graduate student in molecular biology who said he voted against unionization. “I know that there were a lot of people opposed to it, but I didn’t think it would be anywhere close to a majority.”
Because a majority of eligible students had signed authorization cards supporting a unionization effort, union organizers believed that they had garnered enough support to form a union.
“We had broad majority support among the graduate workers throughout the campaign,” said Abhinav Reddy, a graduate student at the School of Public Health and a union organizer. “I think that there’s a real need and a want for unionization on our campus.”
For Reddy, potential confusion about who was eligible to vote may have affected the results of the election. Union organizers argue that the lists of eligible voters the University provided for the election prevented eligible voters from casting ballots.
“What did create a bit of a disadvantage was there was some confusion and anxiety that was caused by Harvard’s administration regarding voter eligibility,” Reddy said. Reddy said this “confusion” could have deterred eligible students from even attempting to vote.
Of the 3,556 students either on the original voter list Harvard provided for the election or later deemed eligible, 2,728 students have filed counted ballots.  An additional 314 students' ballots remain under challenge.
Members of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers have filed an objection to the election with the NLRB, arguing that inaccuracies in the lists of eligible voters the University provided may have prevented some eligible students from voting. The NLRB is currently considering these objections and is expected to release its decision prior to the Feb. 21 hearing.
Harvard administrators have said repeatedly that they did not exclude eligible students from voting.
"Harvard and the union worked hard to ensure that all students eligible to vote did so,” said Paul R. Curran, Harvard’s Director of Labor and Employee Relations. “As the National Labor Relations Board reviews this election, Harvard will continue to cooperate fully to confirm the results."
While union organizers point to authorization cards from February as an indicator that the effort would succeed, some opponents of unionization say that the cards were not an accurate way of determining voters’ views. Froberg said that the number of authorization cards may not have been a true reflection of support for the unionization effort.
Union effort organizers asked graduate students to sign the cards last year to demonstrate their support for forming a union. The NLRB requires 30 percent of eligible employees in a workplace to sign authorization cards in order to go forward with a unionization election.
“[Organizers] were extremely aggressive about getting you to sign the authorization card.  They didn’t necessarily explain what the authorization card was, or what the union was,” said Froberg, “And they kept coming around multiple times...so I think a lot of people were like: ‘Hey, I’ll sign this thing, and so you’ll stop coming after me.’”
Froberg added that many students who were “initially supportive” of the union’s authorization card campaign may not have ended up supporting the union during the election.
“Among my lab—six students—I’m the only one who didn’t sign a card, but every single one of us voted against it, ultimately,” said Froberg.
In an emailed statement, Reddy said that union organizers value "maintaining a healthy and open dialogue between all student workers."
Some students said that graduate students in the sciences may have been less likely to support unionization than students in the humanities. The different incentives for the respective groups of graduate students may have affected the way they voted, some students said.
“Our wages are comparatively much higher, we generally don’t do much teaching, we’re generally less dependent on having teaching, we’re generally more free, so I think in terms of the immediate obvious benefits, they’re much greater for students in the humanities,” said Jean Fan, a graduate student in biomedical informatics at the Medical School who said she voted in favor of unionization.
David A. Nee, a graduate student in English who supported unionization, also said that humanities students are more likely to support unionization.
“When you come into the program, various PhD programs, it sort of seems that everything is fairly straightforward in terms of your funding and health insurance and things like that,” he said. “Actually, it ends up being a bit more complex, and there are some surprises in store for people.”
Some students who opposed unionization questioned if a single union would be able to effectively bargain for graduate students in different disciplines and with different work environments.
“It’s better to be specific. GSAS is very different from other departments, and maybe it would be better to have different unions in different departments,” said Wenlong Yang, a graduate student in chemistry, “To mix everything together… I think that is a place where you would have very low efficiency.  You have all those different people, and different people have different needs.”
Fan, however, argued that, in the end, a union would benefit all graduate students at Harvard.
“It’s important for Harvard graduate students to have a platform on which to file legal grievances,” Fan said. “I think we’re at the point where we really need dedicated legal support...Going forward, we can’t continuously rely on just student initiatives and the goodwill of Harvard.”
Reddy, who studies computational biology, said that many STEM students also supported unionization.
“As someone who is in a STEM field, I completely support unionization and a bunch of my peers support unionization,” he said. “It’s not like we don’t have STEM students.”
Students also said that campaigns launched by the University and the unionization effort shaped the election’s results.
Before the election, union supporters knocked on the doors of eligible voters, spoke to them in dining halls about unionization, and sent emails to students to urge them to vote in favor of a union.
Nee said these outreach efforts helped convince him to support the union.
“As soon as I got into a room with fellow graduate students, with my peers and colleagues who were organizing to form their own union, it was very clear to me that these were people working in good faith on concerns that affected all of us in the community,” he said.
But these outreach efforts still left some voters with concerns about unionization. Mark Lipstein, a graduate student in biological and biomedical science at the Medical School, said he was concerned about how union dues would be used.
Harvard, too, communicated with potential voters leading up to the election.  The Provost’s Office set up an FAQ webpage on unionization and administrators, including Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Xiao Li-Meng, sent multiple emails to students informing them of the date and time of the election and urging them to consider potential consequences of unionization.
Some students said that the University’s outreach efforts, particularly those closer to the election, were not as intense as the union organizers’ but may have had a wider audience.
“For a number of the electorate, that was maybe their first real engagement with the issue,” said Massimo Cè, a graduate student in classics who supported unionization.
Andrea Kriz, a graduate student in the biological and biomedical sciences, criticized this accelerated timeline, arguing that many students had to quickly learn about the arguments for and against unionization.
“I think it was less than three weeks after we got the initial email that there would be an election that the election was actually held,” Kriz, who voted against unionization, said.
Kriz said future student unionization efforts might benefit from having more time to allow students to learn about the union and decide.
“There’s not really a rush.  They can have another election next year, as many years as they want,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard students have banded together after the presidential election to form the “Harvard Student Power Network,” a group intended to unite activists at the University against President-elect Donald Trump.
The group first formed in late November in response to Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton. The idea for the network arose from discussions between Harvard’s student activists in the days following the election, according to Sonya A. L. Karabel ’18, an active member of the group and an organizer with the Student Labor Action Movement.
“The idea is to increase communication between different segments of the activist community so that we can stand together more effectively,” Karabel, an inactive Crimson editor, said. “If anything huge comes up, we can really quickly mobilize. Maybe something like we really need to protect undocumented students now because mass deportations are a threat.”
Karabel and several SLAM members sent emails to a number of Harvard activist and cultural groups—including Divest Harvard and the Black Students Association—to recruit members for an anti-Trump coalition. A group for the Power Network on the messaging app GroupMe currently has 75 members, Karabel said.
Since its founding in late November, the student coalition has met twice in Boylston Hall, drawing approximately 40 people to each meeting, according to Karabel. She added the group is a “work in progress,” with members still “hammering out” details like leadership structure and timing of future meetings. Currently, the group consists mainly of undergraduates, though Karabel said several graduate students are involved.
The group will kick off its first event, a three-day program intended to teach Harvard students about activism, Tuesday. The event, called “Planning the Resistance: A Student Power Activist Training” and slated to take place mainly in Boylston Hall, includes speeches and workshops led by Harvard students, graduates, and local activists.
Each session on the schedule tackles a different topic. In her workshop Wednesday afternoon, for example, Black Lives Matter Cambridge organizer DiDi Delgado plans to instruct students on “nonviolent direct action.”
Anwar Omeish ’19, a member of the network who helped organize the training, said the event has three goals: to foster connections between student activists, to provide attendees with a “political education,” and to build participants’ “skill sets” as activists.
“I hope people will leave feeling empowered with the skills and the knowledge that they can then take to organizing around important issues,” she said.
A Facebook event for the training invites Harvard students to “join the resistance” against Trump’s presidency and policies.
On the final day of training, roughly 30 participants will leave Harvard for Washington, D.C. to participate in protests against Trump on Jan. 20, when he will be inaugurated.  Jonathan S. Roberts ’17, an active member of the network, said he thought the D.C. trip would help students understand what “resistance looks like.”
As she prepared for the network’s first formal event, Karabel said she is excited about the group’s ability to navigate an uncertain future.
“The idea is that this group can be called upon when something is really going down,” she said. “So we’ll see what goes down.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Saturday’s meet with Penn and Brown was supposed to be a trap for the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team, then the Crimson did not get the memo.
Over the weekend in Philadelphia, Harvard blew the doors off the Quakers and Bears for its two largest margins of victory this season. The Crimson medaled in every event of the eight-hour meet, taking multiple spots on the podium in most, en route to a 206-88 victory over Penn (7-3, 4-3) and a 226-74 win over Brown (5-3, 2-3).
“Just being able to stay focused for that long as a team and keep the energy level high was a challenge,” senior Christian Carbone said. “We went into the meet with the goal of not underestimating [Penn]...making sure that we go in guns ablazing and give it our all every single race and that’s exactly what we did, we pretty much dominated the entire meet.”
Now Harvard (8-0, 5-0 Ivy League) will enter the school year with an unblemished record—just in time for a matchup with similarly undefeated Yale in New Haven, Conn. over Super Bowl weekend.
Junior Steven Tan and freshman Dean Farris led the way for the Crimson, with each taking home three golds in the eight-hour meet. The pair was key in Harvard relay victories that were bookends to the weekend sweep.
Tan swam the opening leg for a 200-meter medley relay team that took first in the weekend’s first swimming event. The Aurora, Ill. native was followed by senior Maxim Yakubovich (butterfly) and juniors Shane McNamara (breaststroke) and Ed Kim (freestyle). Together the group edged out Penn by nearly two seconds.
All four members of the quartet took home other medals on the weekend. Tan, Yakubovich, and Kim were joined by Farris in the 400-yard freestyle relay, in which Harvard won with a time of 3:00.18.
“I think that we’re performing the best we have all season,” junior diver Bobby Ross said. “We just got off of training trip so that was a really intense period of training. For the divers, we’re doing better than we have all season. We just feel really confident and really consistent in all of our performances.”
Between victories in the two relays, McNamara took home gold in the 100-yard breaststroke and fourth in the 200-yard variety of that event; Tan laid claim to a victory in the 50-meter freestyle; and Yakubovich was third in the 200-yard butterfly. Farris won the 100 and 200-yard freestyles, with classmate Zach Snyder taking third in the latter.
“This year’s freshman class, at least since I’ve been here, has definitely been one of the best,” Carbone said. “They comparatively get better every year which I think speaks a lot to the direction Ivy League swimming is moving in. It just shows how competitive Ivy League swimming is getting, which is absolutely amazing.”
Farris has not looked like a freshman at all this year, winning the 100 free in every Ivy contest this season. Snyder has also been a standout for the Crimson, edging out sophomore Brennan Novak in the 500-yard freestyle. The silver was Novak’s second podium finish of the day, with the 2015 Gonzaga College High School graduate taking first in the 1,000-yard freestyle.  Not to be outdone by his first-year classmates, Daniel Chang came out on top in two separate 200-yard events—the breastroke and the individual medley, in which he set a pool record.
Harvard’s one medal sweep on the weekend came in the 200-yard backstroke, with sophomore Daniel Tran, senior Jack Manchester, and junior Koya Osada going one-two-three. Tran broke the pool record in that race and also took third in the 100-yard backstroke, a race which Osada won. Senior Christian Carbone won the 200-yard butterfly and junior Luke Morgan-Scott brought home gold in the 100-yard edition.
The Crimson also medaled in the two diving events of the weekend. Juniors Bobby Ross and David Pfeifer were the top two finishers in one-meter diving while Pfeifer also took third in the three-meter. The performances in the one-meter were personal bests for both juniors.
“It was really exciting for us because we both had the 12 best dives that we’ve ever put together collectively on one board,” Ross said. “It was just really fun being in rhythm with a teammate and both be crushing dive after dive so that was really exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An event that occurs once might be lucky. Maybe twice, too. But when the same outcome happens six times in a row, something other than chance is at play.
This weekend, the Harvard women’s track and field team hosted the Crimson Multi-Meet in collaboration with the Beantown Challenge, which pits Boston schools against each other. And for the sixth year in a row, the women’s track and field team took first place in this Beantown Challenge.
In the broader Multi-Meet competition, the men’s and women’s teams combined to rake in nine event wins and place second overall behind the University of Rhode Island. While the women won their half of the meet with 138 points, the men took fifth with 80, or 10.83 behind fourth-place Brown.
“As with every year, these early meets aren't wildly important, but they do set the tone for the approaching season,” captain Raegan Nizdil said. “They are our first opportunity as a team to come together and compete alongside each other, which is an exciting change from our practice pace.”
It was in the field events that Harvard truly thrived. Of the team’s nine total event wins, four came in this arena.
The Crimson swept pole vault and shot put. For the women, junior Marlena Sabatino cleared a height of 3.80 meters to grab gold in pole vault, while senior Nikki Okwelogu did the same for shot put by tossing her weight 15.71 meters. That throw by Okwelogu represented the 16th best in the nation.
The senior continued her success with a second-place finish in weight throw with a distance of 16.45 meters. Also placing for the women in pole vault was sophomore Nicole Trenchard, who finished third with a jump of 3.35 meters.
“I'm really proud of how our team opened up,” Okwelogu said. “We had a great showing, but no one is satisfied, which is exactly what you want out of a meet this early in the season. We're a very driven group, and I'm excited to see what we can do in the coming months.”
On the men’s side, sophomore Ian West set a personal record with a gold medal jump of 4.95 meters in pole vault. Captain Julian Nunally also claimed the gold in shot put throw with a 17.55 toss, good for the 21st best of the season. Senior Josh Whitener led the Crimson in the weight throw with a third-place finish after a 17.43-meter heave.
Another gold medal came at the hands of freshman Zoe Hughes, who won the pentathlon with 3,702 total points. Her male counterpart, freshman Anthony DeNitto, took fourth in the heptathlon with 4,547 total points.
For the women’s team in particular, success was made through the air. Senior Haley Baker claimed a silver medal in the long jump, travelling 5.36 meters. Triple jumpers freshman Simi Fajemisin and junior Floriane Kameni added to the lead with a second and third-place finish, respectively. Nizdil added a bronze medal of her own with a 1.65-meter leap.
In the running events, Harvard also earned some success. Sophomore Gabby Thomas started things off for the women with a gold in the 60-meter dash after a time of 7.42 seconds. At 38.6 seconds, she then clocked the second-fastest 300-meter dash in school history.
“Meets like this at home can produce some impressive results,” Nizdil said. “And this weekend, they did. We were able to see exciting early-season times and marks from our young team members.”
The women continued to do well in short-distance events, with four advancing to the finals of the 60-meter hurdles and three placing in the top five. Freshman Karina Joiner led the pack with silver and a time of 8.73. Senior Jade Miller and freshman Livia Gauntlett followed close behind and took third and fifth, respectively.
In distance running, freshman women dominated the event. Gillian Meeks took second in the mile with a 5:03 time while classmate Eliza Rego claimed fifth with a 2:58 in the 1,000-meter event.
Similarly, the men achieved some success in distance races and the 60-meter hurdles. In the former, junior Jay Hebert clocked 8.09 seconds, a career best and enough to win the event. Sophomore Mitch Valko took fourth in the race with an 8.31 time. In the world of distance running, a Crimson junior, Tyler Spear, grabbed the gold with an 8:29.63 race in the 3,000 meter.
“I am happy with the time that I ran yesterday but even happier because I know that it can still be much better,” Hebert said. “My race wasn't perfect, and I ran a personal best, which means that there's still a lot of room to improve.”
In the relays, the women, represented by senior Sylvia Deppen, freshman Zoe Hughes, Joiner, and freshman Micah Meekins, won gold for the 4x440 in 3:53.58 seconds. The men in the same event, freshman Jacob McLennan, junior Randy Raymond, and freshman twins Will and Tom Rienas, placed fifth at 3:23.74 seconds.
“Given that our team is very young, it's great to see how well this past semester's training has prepared them for collegiate competition,” Nizdil said. “I have no doubt that our girls have a lot in store for us throughout these approaching months….The talent is there. All we need to do is stick to our training, commit ourselves and hold each other accountable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months of strength training and weeks of preparation led up to this point—a pair of Illinois matches to open the Harvard men’s volleyball season.
For the occasion, the Crimson traveled to Chicago. Junior setter Marko Kostich and sophomore setter Spencer Scott grew up in nearby suburbs, so the plane-ride trip provided a homecoming.
However, heavyweights Lewis and Loyola (Ill.) gave a cold welcome. On Friday night, the No. 8 Flyers (3-1) eked out a five-set win, and on Saturday afternoon, the No. 9 Ramblers (3-2) swept to victory.
Harvard (0-2) will have three more chances to pick up a nonconference win before EIVA play starts in mid-February.
“If you start the season playing good opponents, you get used to a high level of play,” junior outside hitter Brad Gretsch said. “You can either replicate it or find a way to defend against it, which will be the case with some teams that we’ll see in our conference play.”
NO. 9 LOYOLA (Ill.) 3, HARVARD 0
A kill. Another kill. A service ace.
That’s how Loyola ended the match on Saturday, sending the Crimson packing after a lopsided stretch to close the third frame.
In that final game, the score seesawed to 10-10 until the Ramblers took eight of the next nine points. That run, which ultimately gave Loyola a 25-14 win, buried any Harvard hopes of escaping a 2-0 set hole.
“Their middle was really effective,” captain Samuel Murphy said. “They have some big guys in the middle there, and they run that set very quickly.”
The Crimson faced a deficit in the first place because of a torturous opening frame. Harvard overcame a 15-11 gap to tie the game at 24-24. But Loyola nabbed the next two points after attacking errors by Harvard.
On the afternoon, the Crimson hit .146, including .036 in the last game. Captain Casey White led the team with seven kills on 23 attempts.
Much more efficient was the Ramblers’ attack, which notched 44 kills versus 11 errors. In the second set, the hosts hit a mind-blowing .667, exactly .500 above Harvard, and cruised to a 25-17 victory.
Paul Narup led the way for Loyola with 10 kills and a .643 hitting percentage, but three other teammates notched at least seven finishes. The Harvard defense struggled to contain the attack, as the visitors did not record a block in the final set-and-a-half.
“I thought our energy level was kind of low,” Gretsch said. “We faltered off after that first set.”
NO. 8 LEWIS 3, HARVARD 2
Freshman outside hitter Erik Johnsson was serving, and the Crimson had life.
Down 14-9 in a fifth-set tiebreaker, Harvard had seemed headed for defeat. But on three match straight points, the Crimson had repelled the Flyers, closing the gap to 14-12.
When Johnsson, who had 10 kills on the night, leapt into the air, the result remained in doubt. But when the rookie landed, that contest was decided. A service error ended the marathon night and handed Loyola a 3-2 win.
It was an achievement for Harvard even to push the match to five sets. In the third set, the Flyers had launched a sustained assault, grabbing 10 of the final 11 points to claim a 25-13 frame.
The Crimson had responded by staying close in the fourth. And then, when Loyola led 23-22, Harvard had won the next three points off two kills and an attack error to force a tiebreaker.
“It’s tough when you’re playing a strong team and you know there are going to be stretches when they’re playing well,” Murphy said. “We did a pretty good job of staying with the match.”
White topped the Crimson with 11 kills, and he added 10 digs for the double-double. However, the night belonged to the Flyers’ Ryan Coenen, who racked up 23 finishes and 10 digs.
Coenan tallied nine of these kills in the first game, when Loyola ripped off a 6-0 run early in play to seize control. The final set score was 25-18.
As in the fourth game, though, Harvard answered with a frame of its own. In this case, the Crimson took control early, repelled a mid-set comeback, and earned a 25-19 win.
All night, Harvard had found a way to come back—all night, that is, until the final set.
“The only way you really know where you stand in terms of the competition is when you play the top teams,” Murphy said. “We’re encouraged by the potential we saw.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over three minutes into the second half of Monday night’s matchup at Bryant, the Harvard men’s basketball team was putting on one of its most dominant performances of the season—at that point the Crimson was up 21 points against the Bulldogs, and only three Bryant players had scored.
Twelve minutes later, however, what appeared to be a runaway win for Harvard was now a five-point game with just over four minutes on the clock. With the shot clock running down on the Crimson’s next possession, co-captain Siyani Chambers drove right and hit a fadeaway jumper to push the lead to seven. On the ensuing possession, Chambers drove in again and extended the lead to nine at the line with just under three minutes left to play.
The Bulldogs were far from calling it a game, however.
For the next two minutes no team would score until freshman Bryce Aiken fouled Bryant guard Adam Grant from beyond the arc. Grant would make all three free throws to cut the Harvard (9-5) lead to six. Forty-five seconds later it was Grant again with a jumper to get the Bulldogs (5-14) within four.
On the ensuing possession Bryant would send sophomore Corey Johnson to the line where he would make both free throws, but as they had all night, the Bulldogs responded with a three of their own just seconds later.
What was a 21-point game was now within a possession with just over 30 seconds left on the clock.
On the next possession Bryant fouled freshman guard Justin Bassey on the inbound. He would split free throws to make it a four-point game, but with 19 seconds left on the clock, Chambers fouled Bryant guard Ikenna Ndugba from beyond three. He would make all three and the Harvard lead stood at a single point with 19 seconds left on the clock.
Despite the late comeback from the Bulldogs, the Crimson finished the game perfect from the line and a late Bryant three failed to find the bottom of the net as Harvard escaped with the 70-65 win to close out its nonconference schedule.
What ended as a barrage of three pointers from the Bulldogs began quite similarly—in the first half Bryant opened up scoring with a three-pointer from junior guard Bosko Kostur. After a miss from Johnson on the other end, Kostur came back and hit another one from beyond the arc to give the Bulldogs the early 6-0 lead.
The Crimson responded with a three from Johnson, but Bryant would respond much like it would in the second half—with a three-pointer to keep the lead at six. Despite shooting only 33 percent from deep on the season, the Bulldogs shot the lights out from three on Monday at 53 percent.
Despite the early Bryant lead, Harvard came right back with its class of touted freshman in the first period. At the half, 31 of the Crimson’s 40 points came from three Harvard freshman—Seth Towns, Chris Lewis, and Aiken. Spearheaded by the freshmen, Harvard went on a 23-6 run to take the early lead.
The offensive effort continued early into the second frame. The Crimson began the period on an 8-0 run to take what would be its largest lead of the game at 22. From there though, the Bulldog defense would hold off the Crimson for much of the rest of the game as Bryant began finding its way from deep. Midway through the second, Harvard would be held without a field goal for nearly seven minutes.
Despite the suffocating defense late from the hosts, the depth of Tommy Amaker’s squad proved to be the difference as it usually is—four Crimson players would score in double digits while Harvard’s bench outscored Bryant’s 30-5.

Now that recruitment for finance internships is far, far behind us, it’s time for the rest of us to get cracking on finding some sort of summer activity that looks great on our resume. The real stumbling block, though, in applying for these sorts of positions is that the jobs that would make you look most employable are the ones that are for the dreaded letter of recommendation. Asking for a rec letter is intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be. With our easy guide, you’ll be an expert at putting together application with stellar rec letters.
Go to office hours: We cannot stress this enough. You will regret that extra hour of sleep that you nagged when your professor sidesteps you in your hour of need. Get to know the person you’re asking to write your rec letter outside of class! Professors and TFs want people to be interested in what they’re teaching you and they are more likely to do this favor for you if they actually recognize you.
Ask in advance: Don’t wait until the last minute to ask this of someone. No one likes to be asked to do important work with no prior warning, and it’s tough to think of nice things to say about someone when you have to write a letter if you’re thinking about all the other important work you should be doing with this time you did not allot for writing.
Say thank you: This is the most important step! You absolutely need to thank the person who wrote your rec letter, either with a heartfelt email or maybe even a handwritten card.
Follow up: Let your savior know how the rest of the application process went. You don't want to make them feel like you only cared about them for the one second they were helpful to you. If you get the job, thank them (again) for being instrumental in your success.. If not, tell them anyway, and fill them in on your alternative plans.
And there you have it. Follow these steps and you should be fine. If the application is due soon, there’s always the fallback email with the subject line “HELP” sent to your academic adviser at 2 a.m., because at least you can count on one person on this campus to be at that ungodly hour.*
*do not try this at home, kids.
