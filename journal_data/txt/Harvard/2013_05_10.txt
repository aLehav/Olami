After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forget the written law for a moment, the countless pieces of legislation that govern our actions and the hallowed founding document to whose guidelines they must conform. Consider a different type of law, the true social contract: the unspoken but still unbreakable rules that dictate what behavior will earn us real-life friends and what behavior will yield weekend nights sitting alone in our rooms watching a different type of Friends on Tivli.
A firm grasp of these rules goes much further toward getting off on the right foot freshman year of college than does an equally solid understanding of the Necessary and Proper clause of the Constitution. Certainly, knowing the extent of Congress’s power does nothing to inform a clueless freshman at what point in the year it becomes uncouth to seat oneself next to strangers in Annenberg.
Like most members of my incoming class, I walked through Johnston Gate with more than a little U.S. history under my belt. But when it came to the do’s and don’t’s of college etiquette, to finding my niche and settling in comfortably, I felt about as prepared as Katniss Everdeen must have when she was thrown into an arena of death with little more than a nylon jumpsuit and a hollow, ominous, “May the odds be ever in your favor.”
And at the beginning, I was quite convinced the cards were stacked against me. During opening days, I wandered through the dining hall desperately attempting to find lunch companions. Instead, I met only with tables full of unwelcoming classmates who shot each other quizzical looks after observing the poorly constructed, Monterey-jack-oozing grilled cheese I had attempted to prepare myself. They were lumped together for mutual protection, I thought, members of alliances like the Hunger Games’ Career cohort.
As far as I was concerned, the freshman world was dog-eat-dog, tribute-spear-tribute.  With every day came a new rush toward the Cornucopia to gather items perceived as essential to survival. Some were harder to acquire than others. Everyone could lay their hands on everyday necessities like those in Katniss’s backpack: an umbrella, a Snuggie, Advil, Adderall, condoms.
But the vital weapons, those with potential to slay enemies and raise a competitor to the top of the food chain, posed some problems. One, Cato’s broadsword: a reliable buddy for late-night Pinkberry runs. Two, Joanna Mason’s axe: a Pudding punch invitation. Three, Finnick Odair’s trident: a sensational story to tell at Sunday brunch about misadventures (and a lost Barbour jacket) in the Owl basement.
When the fastest runners and the most brutal fighters snatched these up, the rest us were left to die of exposure. After all, there could only be one victor. Think otherwise, and you’d be left to swallow nightlock berries while the taunting voice of Caesar Flickerman reminded you of your foolhardiness.
As much as it pains me to admit it, I was wrong. The odds turned out in my favor in the end, and I’d go all-in for every single one of us. Katniss and her fellow tributes had to forsake common ground in the interest of living to see another day. But we freshmen could all win—the Harvard administration is no Capitol of Panem, regardless of how often they illicitly search our emails.
We all started off in the same boat, and we all saw ourselves as underdogs. It just took some time to recognize Finnick’s soft side, Cato’s unwillingness to participate in a sick, zero-sum game. And once that time passed, we grasped each other’s hands, ready to enter the Second Quarter Quell as a team and claim victory as a unit.
Now, when I enter the Annenberg servery and manage to break approximately nine bottles of teriyaki and soy sauce in my quest to acquire the love of my culinary life, Sriracha chili, I can rest assured that I won’t shed my tears of guilt and embarrassment in solitude. My friends, each as steadfast as Peeta Mellark, will console me in my misery.
Sure, I spent a few months convinced that the Capitol could unleash all the rabid, bloody-fanged monsters they wanted on Katniss, and she would still never undergo a trial as onerous as navigating a brand new social scene Saturday night after Saturday night. But if I could go back and choose whether to do it all again, well…
I volunteer as tribute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In the long run we are all dead.” With these famous words, in rebellion against classical economics, legendary economist John Maynard Keynes pioneered a school of thought that dictated that government spending could stimulate the economy and could play an important role in righting a flailing economy. Keynes was inspired by the devastating effects of the Great Depression on standards of living and its ensuing international turmoil.
But according to a comment made by Harvard Professor Niall Ferguson, Keynes had other motivators. In an off-the-cuff remark made at a recent question-and-answer session with financial investors and advisors following a lecture, Ferguson said, "Keynes was a homosexual and had no intention of having children. We are not dead in the long run …our children are our progeny. It is the economic ideals of Keynes that have gotten us into the problems of today." His comments were unequivocally misguided, inaccurate, and offensive. Ferguson has since apologized for his statements, calling them “stupid and tactless,” an apt summary of his thoughtless and hurtful remarks. Not only was there the implication that Keynesian theory is tantamount to a lack of empathy for future generations, an extreme simplification of Keynes’ philosophy, but sexual orientation or childlessness is certainly not indicative of one’s investment in the future.
Although we appreciate Professor Ferguson’s immediate apology in the wake of widespread criticism, he has, to some extent, retraced his steps. Rather than issue a wholly unequivocal apology, Ferguson’s “Open Letter to the Harvard Community” refuted the claim that “sexuality is totally irrelevant to our historical understanding of [Keynes].” Certainly, individuals’ identities can influence their scholarship, but Ferguson’s statement to the Harvard community immediately after his blunder need not have put forward qualifications for his mistake.
Not only were Ferguson’s comments deeply offensive, but they also carried with them the authority of an endowed professorship in the Harvard history department. Ferguson’s blunder highlights the need for professors to be ever cognizant that flippant speech is doubly dangerous from the mouth of a respected academic representing a respected institution, reflecting poorly on both himself and Harvard. When speaking to an audience on the basis of expertise, professors must not stray from the thoughtful and professional tenor that does justice to the authority granted them.
Ferguson’s position as a prominent Harvard professor provides academic authority for all of his claims, regardless of the context they are made in. Flippancy becomes all the more dangerous for those whose words are granted automatic authority by their occupation. We are glad to see Harvard professors making a name for themselves outside of the classroom, but this must not come at the expense of thoughtfulness and prudence.
Given the wave of social change in favor of BGLT rights that this country has undergone in the last few decades, Professor Ferguson’s comments were a reminder of the special and undue scrutiny that gay people still face. We hope that the instant backlash the comments received is a lesson to all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As anyone forced to listen to me will confirm, I am practically made of opinions. But when debate rages on these pages and at the dinner table over affirmative action, gun control, abortion, and the like, I retreat to the sidelines and keep mum. The same goes for most arguments framed in terms of a Democratic side and a Republican side to the issue: I’ll calmly diagnose each tribe’s pathology, explain that third-trimester dilation and extraction is probably not a good idea, and hustle the conversation in some more salacious direction.
For many in the punditocracy and its feeder circles on university campuses, these debates mean everything. If it is noble to work on a Senate campaign, it is yet nobler to fight for a “struggle of our generation,” like marriage equality, national debt awareness, or wage increases for campus library workers. If it’s in front of our eyes and morally unambiguous, it simply must be world-historical.
This narrow political intellectual culture, perpetuated by an unimaginative caste of wonks, activists, and joiners, assumes away the technological and social transformations of the last three decades while ignoring the prospect that what’s debatable today might be utterly irrelevant by the middle of the century. That is to say, despite the fruitful explorations of our intellectual class, political discourse qua political discourse is simply missing the real issues. As three-dimensional printing stands on the cusp of igniting a revolution in the means of production and genetic engineering stands to radically transform the means of reproduction, the Institute of Politics continues to hold panels better-suited to the 1970s. It is high time that “issues”-minded folk broaden their sense of what constitutes an “issue.”
For the time being, it is both comfortable and profitable for would-be political commentators to butt heads over well-rehearsed questions of small versus large government, corporate capitalism versus state socialism, and individual liberty versus collective gain. However, the rise of empirical social science has profoundly scrambled these 19th-century debates, which, if you buy into dispositional theories of political orientation like I do, are pretty much irreconcilable—projections of our conflicting moral instincts, rather than sound bases for working out effective policy. Disruptive, self-replicating technologies are fueling the rise of a creative, decentralized economy whose total novelty should give serious pause to supporters of morally bankrupt disaster capitalism and delusional anti-human socialism alike.
Discussion of such ponderous matters is so rare that it’s even worth praising Newt Gingrich’s techno-fetishistic obsession with the moon for, at the very least, daring to imagine a world beyond today’s. And as irresponsible as it would be for me to dismiss questions about social security’s long-term solvency and the appropriate federal response to gun violence, I cannot sit by as members of the political class laugh away issues of sustainability, psychedelic research, intellectual property, human enhancement, and geoengineering as matters of the apolitical long-term.
What has resulted from this lag between politics and technology is an invisible, potentially devastating democratic deficit. Whether or not political types debate the merits of Jaron Lanier, Stewart Brand, and Ray Kurzweil as assiduously as they’ve debated Burke, Marx, and Hayek, research, technology, and closed-door policy will continue to march in the direction of technologically-mediated social disruption. As we continue to argue about what happened at Benghazi or how deep the National Rifle Association’s tentacles penetrate, Google, MakerBot, and the federal government’s own Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency are hard at work engineering the 20th century’s conflicts over ownership, struggle, and identity out of existence.
We already know the basic contours of this inevitable transformation, its watchwords as materially relevant as they are inscrutable: “creative economy,” “cloud,” “neural networks,” “life extension,” “nanotech.” But it’s up to us, by way of our dollars and our votes, to determine the particulars. Tech activism successfully thwarted SOPA and PIPA, proposed legislative steps toward a proprietary, undemocratic internet. However, only a more robust conversation of political thought leaders, voters, and consumers will be able to guide us through the next few decades’ uncertain shoals and help us to steer technological progress in accordance with our values, whatever they may be. Exponential computer intelligence, indefinite life extension, and the quantitative tracking of our every last biological quiver can be harnessed toward either Locke or Minority Report. Our odds at the former will not be helped until the talking heads at MSNBC and the IOP Forum can set their to a longer time horizon.

We find ourselves drawn to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby” because it possesses everything that a good story should. Fitzgerald crafts its sentences with the perfect mix of heartache, drama, and romance. His world is one of extravagant parties and mint juleps and gorgeous people, and the image of the epic West Egg soiree has a quality so irresistible that it has inspired a number of endearing but unsuccessful attempts at Gatsby-themed events here on campus (Great Fratsby? STOP) as well as a new Hollywood film (Ah! Leo! Jay-Z! Clothes!). Yes, The Great Gatsby is sexy, but, as Sarah Churchwell appropriately reminds us in the Guardian’s movie review, the book actually spends little time inviting readers into bashes at Jay’s big white house: “Fitzgerald's novel in fact features just three parties, and only one of these offers paeans to its own splendours.” The Great Gatsby is important not because of glamour and booze, but because it cuts straight to my deepest fears. Fitzgerald highlights the great tragedy beneath the American experience, and his commentary hits my generation, my Harvard peers, and me right where it hurts.
To some extent, we all live like Nick Carraway, “within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.” We remain active members of American culture, even when it disgusts us. My classmates and I came of age under the burden of a slow recovery from a recession created by the greed of few and inflicted on the shoulders of many. We wear the scars of school shootings, yet our government remains incapable of passing basic safeguards against gun violence. Like members of the Lost Generation in the 1920s, our generation has reason to be disillusioned.
Churchwell writes of “the founding American myth: that the marketplace can be a religion, that the material can ever be ideal.” I was in eighth grade during the throes of financial crisis in 2008, and when I think about subprime lenders, I’m reminded of the way Nick describes his friends in East Egg: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness...and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” Greed, poor regulation, and the resulting bailout fit neatly into this narrative.
Fitzgerald’s most iconic image is the symbolic green light on Daisy’s dock, Gatsby’s unshakeable subscription to a nebulous American dream. He writes, “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.” The American definition of success is intensely attractive: If I work hard, I can change the world! Yet the model is replete with inconsistencies.
A Harvard student has the drive and determination of a young Jay Gatz. His father, Henry Gatz, describes him just like any of our parents might describe us: “Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind?” In high school, I strove to create the best possible version of myself. Like so many of my classmates, I studied for hours each day, motivated by an idealized image of a letter that I believed would be my success: An acceptance to Harvard would give me the opportunity to acquire skills that could change my life and the lives of others.
We are all here because we worked hard, but something sinister lurks underneath every long night I spend in Lamont. I am faced with cold reality—that luck is what carried me here, and there are thousands of others with potential, smarts, and drive who did not receive the same opportunity. I’m not talking about those unlucky individuals who were forced to go to sub-par schools like Yale. I’m talking about those who may not have had time for homework because they had to hold down a job and take care of their siblings, or those who were never even told that college was a possibility for them. Nick’s dad once told him to “remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” Inequity of opportunity is the dark side of the American dream, and another dimension to this underside is a nagging fear that our political system might fail to correct society’s deficiencies.
I wonder whether we are all working toward the same green light here at Harvard. Bearing witness to a dismal job market has forced some to seek economics degrees in an attempt to make sense of the financial mess and achieve the coveted financial security that a liberal arts degree no longer guarantees. What happened to civic responsibility? Many of us have idealistic goals, but for others, cynicism and distrust have led to less altruistic aims.
Are those with a distant vision of a unified country simply ignorant, or are they latching onto something profound that I cannot grasp? When will we arrive at a land of equal opportunity? Is it even possible for our broken political system to carry us to this new, greenly lit frontier any time soon? Fitzgerald’s prose has colored the lens through which I view some of the most important experiences of my lifetime. If I’m asking for a book to speak to my generation, I feel I should look no further.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 9, 2013, at 11:22 p.m.
A proposal that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved at their monthly meeting on Tuesday will restructure reading and exam periods starting in the fall of 2014. It outlines the kind of assignments that may be assigned or due throughout Reading Period, which will be shortened from eight days to six or seven.
The proposal, which the faculty approved unanimously, stipulates that courses may not assign new material during Reading Period, though “short, regular assignments” dealing with material from the last two weeks of classes may be due during the first three days. These short assignments include problem sets and response papers.
Culminating assignments such as projects, take-home exams, final papers, and presentations will be due “no earlier than the fourth day of Reading Period” but must be due “on or before the day of each course’s assigned Examination Group.” Exam period will also be renamed Final Examination and Project Period.
Seated exams “of whatever duration ... or scope” must also be given during the course’s assigned exam slot. Except for certain intensive language courses, the proposal prohibits “regular instruction” during Reading Period, although courses may hold review sessions and sections, as well as make-up classes.
Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, Vice President of the Undergraduate Council, voiced approval for the proposal.
“It’s definitely good that it was passed,” Zhu said. “I know students have expressed to us in the past how stressful it is to have... all your papers due the same day at the end of Reading Period.... This allows a little more flexibility, and a little more time to actually use Reading Period to be preparing for a lot of the final assignments or final exams or projects or papers, and so on.”
Zhu attended Committee on Undergraduate Education meetings throughout the semester, where faculty, administrators, and students discussed the proposal. She also praised Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris for seeking input from both the UC and faculty on the proposal.
Harris invited UC representatives to attend a faculty town hall meeting about the proposal on April 16, according to Zhu. During the meeting, she said, faculty raised concerns about, among other things, how the proposed change would affect problem sets.
Harris wrote in an email that the approved proposal “should help spread out due dates, and give students time to do their work.” He added that the proposal will make it unlikely that students have three or four papers or projects due on the same day, “while still holding students responsible for managing their time well.” He said the proposal, originally developed by the CUE, was “significantly revised,” both after meeting with the UC and after the town hall meeting. The original language of the proposal, for example, did not designate the first three days of Reading Period for short assignment due dates.

As the clock struck midnight, shouts rang out across Harvard Yard. Despite exams to come in nine hours, students bared it all in the spring incarnation of an age-old, clothing-optional tradition: Primal Scream.
The event, which takes place at midnight before the first exam of each semester, drew a diverse crowd to the Yard Thursday night. Daring undergraduates stripped down past their undergarments and sprinted around the Old Yard to the tunes of “The Final Countdown” and “Chariots of Fire,” performed by the Harvard University Band.
Though a number of students lined the freshman dorms in support of their classmates, Harvard affiliates were not the only spectators. Primal Scream drew viewers from across Cambridge and even from foreign nations.
“I think it’s pretty cool,” said Kan-Ju Lin, a Taiwanese post-doctoral student at MIT, of the scantily clad Harvardians. “I’ve never seen people running naked.”
Participants ranged from Primal Scream virgins to veterans.
“I’m halfway there,” said Edwin L. Whitman ’15, who has completed four of four dashes. “Spring’s always a smaller turnout but it’s the people who do it all the time or the seniors so it’s more fun.”
Unlike Whitman, not all of this semester’s screamers planned to run.
“It was so awesome,” Phebe J. Hong ’16 said. “It was totally spontaneous. I decided at the last minute—I just took everything off and I ran.”
The winter run is historically better-attended, and participants this spring were as sparse as clothing. Still, over one hundred students rose to the occasion for a lap to end this year’s reading period.
Primal Scream, which began in the 1960s as a communal, cathartic yell before the start of exams, neglected clothing in the 1990s when it went au natural. To this day, many students appreciate the break it offers in the midst of exam stress.
“It’s a tradition,” Brian W. Ventura ’16 said. “It’s a lot of fun… We’re stereotyped as being uptight but this is kind of a nice release.”
One lap was only the tip of the iceberg for a number of particularly excited nudists, who continued on in their birthday suits for a second lap or, in the case of one intrepid runner, a racy photo with John Harvard.
“There should be so much more skin,” Hong said.
Despite the influx of tourists gathering on the steps of University Hall for a glimpse of the action, no increase in Harvard University Police Department officers was noted. Securitas officers declined to comment.

The Harvard men’s tennis team has withstood the rigors of the Ivy League season, but it will face a new challenge on Friday when it takes on No. 67 Samford (15-9, 7-3 Southern Conference) in the first round of the NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament at Mississippi State University in Starkville, Miss.
The No. 27 Crimson (18-5, 6-1 Ivy) earned the program’s 21st berth in the tournament after clinching its second consecutive Ivy title with a win over Dartmouth on April 27th. Host Mississippi State, the region’s top seed, will take on Austin Peay on Friday.
Harvard has a 14-21 record all-time in tournament matches, and its best finish was a quarterfinal appearance in 1997.
The Bulldogs qualified for the tournament for the second time in three seasons after winning the Southern Conference Tournament.
And although the Crimson played in the NCAA Tournament last year, falling in the second round to Florida after defeating Virginia Tech, it will have plenty to contend with in Samford, which it has never faced.
Both teams faced Alabama in February—Harvard fell to the Crimson Tide, but the Bulldogs beat them. Still, the Crimson has little idea what to expect.
“We’ve never seen them play, and the same goes for them with us,” head coach Dave Fish said. “There will be a nervous feeling-out period, but we’re both going to be very competitive with each other. Both teams will be prepared, and we’ll just have to earn a win.”
Despite Samford’s low ranking relative to Harvard, it has already earned the Crimson’s respect.
“They’ve beaten Alabama, so we have a certain measure of respect for them,” Fish said. “We certainly didn’t beat Alabama. Plus, in tennis, anyone can lose to anyone on any given day.”
Harvard will look to attack the Bulldogs in doubles to establish a foothold early on, but it will have to contend with the effects of having not played in almost two weeks.
“We’ve been practicing a lot and brushing some rust off from the end of the Ivy season,” sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri said. “We haven’t competed in a match in two weeks, so we want to come out and play well.”
The Crimson’s will look to its No. 1 doubles team of sophomore Denis Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster to set the pace. The pair earned a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection last week after posting a 13-3 record in dual play.
Senior co-captain Andy Nguyen, who plays second doubles with freshman Nicky Hu, also earned second-team All-Ivy honors in doubles.
Samford’s first doubles team of Zac Dunkle and Garrison Laduca is just 4-11, but their No. 2 and No. 3 teams both boast winning records for the season.
“Doubles has always been an equalizer for us,” Fish said. “We have a good team, but our job gets much easier if we win the doubles point. We’re pretty tough to beat when we do, so the task is to do that and give us a much better chance.”
In singles, however, the Bulldogs are strong: whereas Harvard’s top two of Denis Nguyen and sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri lost to the Alabama’s top two, Samford’s Dunkle and Elliot Barnwell took them down.
The team has a winning record at each of the six singles spots. Bulldog freshman Fares Kilani is 18-6 at third singles, including an 8-0 April run that earned him the Southern Conference player of the month, and Austin Akers is 14-8 on the fifth court on the year.
But the Crimson, too, can compete in singles. Singles specialist Chaudhuri went 6-1 in league play at No. 2, which earned him first-team All-Ivy honors. Denis Nguyen also won first-team accolades.
Harvard featured two more players on the second team: sophomore Alex Steinroeder, who went 15-8 in dual play, and Andy Nguyen, who had a dominant season, going 16-4 in dual play.
The Crimson has its sights set on a trip to the University of Illinois, but it must win two matches down south first, starting with the Bulldogs on Friday.
“Making it to the round of 16 would be great,” Chaudhuri said. “That’s a special tournament with a lot of history, and it’s one of our goals to qualify for it. We’re close, but we have to go through a couple of good teams before we get there.”
If Harvard pulls off the opening-round victory, it will be slated to play again on Saturday, taking on the winner of the match between Mississippi State and Austin Peay.
“We’re trying not to look too far forward, and will just play our game,” Chaudhuri said. “This is a fun part of the season. We’ve been working hard all year and hope it pays off, but to be honest, we just want to go out there and have some fun.”

The weather may have not been in prime form at the NCAA Tournament on Friday, but the Harvard men’s tennis team sure was. Despite the match being moved indoors following a rain delay, the Crimson was not deterred, taking four straight singles matches en route to a 4-0 victory over No. 63 Samford in the first round of the 2013 NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament in Starkville, Miss.
With the win, No. 27 Harvard advances to the second round, where it will face the winner of the Mississippi State/Austin Peay match-up.
The Crimson notched its second straight first-round win in the NCAA tournament. Last year, Harvard downed Virginia Tech, 4-2, before falling to Florida in the second round.
The Crimson will hope to improve on last season’s performance when it plays its second round match on Saturday.
On Friday, Harvard cruised past the Bulldogs in the teams’ first head-to-head contest. In the process, the Crimson upped its all-time record in the NCAA Tournament to 15-21.
Because the match was played at Mississippi State’s indoor center, which only has two courts, the match began with singles.
Sophomore Denis Nguyen took the first court and sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri began play on the second. Nguyen defeated Samford’s Zac Dunkle, 6-3, 6-4, to give Harvard the first point of the match. Chaudhuri dropped the first set to Elliot Barnwell, but took control of the next two, 6-2, 6-2, to make the score 2-0.
Senior co-captain Andy Nguyen silenced the Bulldogs’ Fares Kilani, who had gone undefeated in April and was named the Southern Conference player of the month. Nguyen, who went 16-4 in dual play this season, quickly finished him off, 6-1, 6-2.
Sophomore Alex Steinroeder, playing at No. 4, clinched the match for the Crimson with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Samford’s Alex Sajonz, and freshman Nicky Hu’s match on the fifth court was suspended at 2-1.
If Harvard wins on Saturday, it will advance to the Round of 16 at the University of Illinois. The Crimson’s best all-time finish in the NCAA Tournament is its quarterfinal appearance in 1997.

There's a striking difference between the logo of The Upper Crust pizzeria and that of its replacement on Brattle Street, The Just Crust. While The Upper Crust sign depicted the elite image of a butler figure carrying pizza, the door now features the emblem of a worker triumphantly holding up the sign for The Just Crust.
The graphic, designed by a former Upper Crust employee, exemplifies the new atmosphere of the partially worker-owned Just Crust. Adorning the pizzeria's walls are framed articles from The Boston Globe and The Harvard Crimson detailing the legal scandal that led to the fall of The Upper Crust and the rise of The Just Crust.
 
Patrick Joyce, a previous Operations Manager with The Upper Crust and current partner at The Just Crust, said, "We want to create a totally different environment here to have sustainable and local food, but also to have a sustainable work environment" in which the employees comprise an integral part of "the team."
 
Although "Coming Soon" signs still line the windows of the The Just Crust, the pizzeria opened its doors on Thursday night for an intimate "student kick-off party" to thank the Harvard student organizations, predominantly from the Law School, that have supported the restaurant venture and joined in an "anti-boycott," promising to use The Just Crust for all their pizza needs.
"It's a wonderful thing to see so many people come together to support this concept," said Shannon E. Liss-Riordan '90, the lawyer who represented the Upper Crust employees and helped open the new Just Crust. "It has taken a lot of work from a lot of people, and a lot of people really believe in this vision."
