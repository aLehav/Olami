After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Rachelle Brown-Mitchell toured Harvard on Saturday, June 16, the avid reader was especially impressed by Widener Library.
But Brown-Mitchell, who said she’s considering law school one day, won’t be able to study there for at least a few years. She’s only 11.
The student at the Boston public school Elihu Greenwood Leadership Academy in Hyde Park visited Harvard as part of a day-long early college awareness program that invited a group of fourth and fifth graders from two Boston public schools, along with their parents, to campus for an event featuring collaborative science experiments, discussions with college undergraduates, and Harvard campus tours.
Saturday’s event, which welcomed students from the Elihu Greenwood Leadership Academy and Hennigan Elementary School in Jamaica Plain, marked the first time that Harvard has invited both parents and students to its outreach programs.
"The program is an attempt, among others, to break down the barriers children and families might perceive about the lack of accessibility of college,” said Maile Takahashi, who serves as Harvard’s director of community programming.
Joan Matsalia— who is a co-manager of the event’s organizer, the Harvard Achievement Support Initiative—said that research points to parent engagement as an important factor in the academic success of children.
“This event offered a new way for families to get exposure to college and the resources that are available early, during elementary school," she said.
During the day, students and parents from the two schools participated in a series of science experiments and demonstrations organized by Kathryn A. Hollar, director of educational programs at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Hollar said that the activities were aimed at teaching students about everyday materials such as food additives and thickeners, cool polymers, and groundbreaking engineered materials. She said that she wanted to show participants that “great science does not always require expensive equipment and expensive laboratories. It is about ingenuity and sometimes simple experiments.
Hollar noted that, though these students live in a city that is filled with high tech companies, these resources and opportunities might feel inaccessible.  She added that it is important for them to know that with education and training, they can have careers in these companies and fields.
“Combining science and engineering with the early college awareness components via the partnership between HASI and SEAS helps set the stage for these talented and enthusiastic students to pursue rewarding career opportunities in high tech fields,” Hollar wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The event also featured a panel of current Harvard students, including Annika J. Nielsen ’15, who attended Boston public schools before coming to Harvard. The panel fielded questions both parents and students, ranging from whether the transition to college is a big step or a natural process to whether or not students sleep in bunk beds in college.
Karen Wontan, family education coordinator from the Boston Public Schools’ program Parent University, also spoke at the event about the importance of family engagement in successful education.  Harvard recently partnered with Parent University to bring Families Engaged in Learning sessions to families at the John Marshall School in Boston, according to Matsalia.
Wontan commented that visiting campus gave parents a physical reference, “a picture in their mind,” of future possibilities for their children. She also said that it would be beneficial to have college awareness programs for all grades, starting in kindergarten.
Staff, parents, and students from the two schools said the event was a both enjoyable and informative way to share the values of education with their communities.
“This has been an incredible day for all of us,” said Maria Cordon, principal of Hennigan Elementary School, at the end of the day. “To be able to bring my fourth and fifth graders and their parents to Harvard has just been an amazing opportunity.”
Deandra Williams, family and community outreach coordinator at Elihu Greenwood Leadership Academy, said that it is important for children and families to understand “the connection between elementary school and college” and to understand what steps they can take now to reach college in the future.
“The highlight was seeing all the excitement from the younger students and how engaged they were with the speakers and how interested they are in college in general,” said James Prince, an Elihu Greenwood Leadership Academy parent. “I don’t remember being this interested in college when I was nine or ten years old. It’s just exciting seeing how excited they are about their own futures.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s official: Jeremy Lin ’10 is a fan favorite. The emerging star received praise both on and off the court in the first-ever NBA Social Media Awards, which aired this past Wednesday on NBA TV and TNT. Lin played a role in three of the night’s 13 honors, tying him with Kobe Bryant for the most decorated social engager.
Prior to the one-hour show, Lin was honored as the “Social Breakout Player of the Year” thanks to enormous increases in his Twitter and Facebook following. By the time of the announcement, the point guard’s following had increased 34-fold on Twitter since the New York Knicks claimed him off waivers in December of last year.
After a career-changing 25-point performance against the New Jersey Nets on February 4, Lin scored over 20 points and dished eight or more assists in his next two contests, and a surge in popularity was well on its way. But skeptics were still able to point a lack of quality opponents during the streak.
On February 12, against a well-tested NBA force, Lin provided the needed exclamation point on his first week as a bona fide star. In a nationally televised game against the perennial-powerhouse Los Angeles Lakers, the sophomore scored 38 points—eight more than he ever had in his playing days with the Crimson. The game proved to be the year’s fan favorite, as it collected the EPIC Award with the subtitle, “Linsanity Begins.”
Teammate Landry Fields got in on the action by posting a picture of the couch Lin famously inhabited before he could find a permanent residence in the Big Apple. His snapshot—accompanied by the caption “Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only couch made famous by @JLin7! Let the bidding begin”—made Fields the winner of “The Snap Shot Award.”
In other NBA news, a ruling made by arbitrator Kenneth Dam on Friday gave both Lin and teammate Steve Novak early Bird rights, meaning that New York go could over its salary cap to re-sign both players without having to use its mid-level exception. That would allow the team to use its mid-level—worth around $5 million—to sign an outside free agent.
The NBA has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, but it is unlikely to be resolved by July 1, which marks the beginning of free agency.

It's 1:30 in the morning, and you're hungry. But where do you go? It is a divisive debate among the Harvard student body, and loyalties to the Square's late-night stops run deep. Over an 11 day period, The Crimson will debate 11 popular choices around campus. Now up: CVS.
You’re finally finished with that problem set (or essay, or Call of Duty marathon). The crippling hunger you’ve been ignoring all night has finally caught up to you—you must feed the beast. Only one question remains:
Where do you go?
The unadventurous will slink to their House grille. The hipsters will flock to Starbucks or Pinkberry, while the unoriginal will congregate at Pinocchio’s and the Kong. The less educated can be found at Falafel Corner or Boloco. Only those with the most discerning appetites and most sophisticated taste for excellence will choose the ultimate late night eatery: Consumer Value Store (known to laypeople as CVS).
By every measure, CVS is the dominant eating establishment in Harvard Square. Quality? Unquestionable. Possible combinations? Incalculable. Price Point? Unbeatable. While the rest of you peasants are paying $2.50 for a handful of chips and shot of salsa at Felipe’s, I’m spending a pittance on an entire bag of Tostitos and 15.5 ounces of salsa, eating like a king at 1426 Mass Ave. If I feel like spending that $2.50, I could have bought 2 liters of Pepsi, tax-free. Dollar for dollar, nobody protects you from hunger like CVS.
Omit the fact that CVS is the only place in the Square to fill your stomach without emptying your wallet, and it still wins on pure variety. While you’re locked into whatever faux-ethnicity your restaurant purports to serve, I am traveling the culinary world, master of my own destiny. I’m eating Bumble Bee Chunk Light Tuna as an appetizer, sampling Jack Link’s Beef Jerky as antipasti, moving on to the main course of 12 White Castle Burgers, and concluding my meal with a box of Ferraro Rocher Fine Hazelnut Chocolates, which I will wash down with a glass of Listerine. I’ll then get my commemorative photos printed upstairs at competitive rates. Anthony Bourdain can only dream of such an experience.
I have heard the criticisms of the CVS haters, those who claim that CVS is not a “real” dining option as it lacks “tables” or “a kitchen.” I only pity them for the close-mindedness that prevents them from appreciating the finer things in life. Peel away the manufactured labels such as “convenience store” and “pharmacy” imposed by society, the ignorant, and CVS itself, and you realize that it is no different from one of those ultra-chic restaurants where you take your food from a conveyor belt. CVS is the go-to place for people who take what they want, when they want, without the contrived atmosphere of slower, lesser eateries. ­
And at 5:47 a.m., there’s no place I’d rather be. There is also no other place open.
