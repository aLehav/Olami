After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Maybe you have mono,” a new friend suggested whilst searching the internet, as I lamented a growing list of symptoms: fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and a fever. Just days later, after my first trip to Harvard University Health Services, my diagnosis of mononucleosis was confirmed, and I disappointedly joined the ranks of students who deal with an illness during their first semester of college.
Before I officially received my diagnosis, I had already realized that I was not prepared to deal with being sick away from home and my family in California. I lacked a thermometer to verify my fever and food to supplement meal times when I was too exhausted to walk from Pennypacker Hall — the most remote of the freshman dorms — to Annenberg. I didn’t understand how my brand new health insurance worked, and was unsure how to prove to my professors that I was really sick before I had a proper “sick note” from HUHS. Out of desperation, I even offered to send my instructors photos of my brand-new thermometer that read my alarming 101.6 degree fever.
At first, I felt very alone as I dealt with these uncertainties, but I soon realized that my experience getting sick less than a month into college was not unique. In recent weeks, I’ve encountered countless friends, entryway-mates, and acquaintances who are dealing with illnesses ranging from Covid-19 to severe sinus infections to the most mysterious and undiagnosable of them all — the “frat or freshman flu.”
Besides these personal experiences, countless news outlets have also chronicled this phenomenon. The Daily Pennsylvanian wrote about the “freshman plague” last fall, and The Crimson itself published a piece last October that referenced a “college sickness” spreading throughout campus. National news organizations like NBC and U.S. News and World Report have also reported on this, offering suggestions for combating the inevitable. The high rates of sickness are most commonly attributed to the increased frequency of contact among students — think communal bathrooms, large lectures, and use of shared spaces like common rooms and libraries — in contrast to the decreased contact students experience while living at home.
With this experience being so widespread among freshmen, one might expect Harvard to have some sort of guide for students who are sick besides the suggestion in the student handbook to seek guidance from HUHS. Though HUHS provided me with practical medical advice, they were unable to advise me on how to navigate the stressful logistics of an unfamiliar college lifestyle while sick, beyond a suggestion to speak with my proctor or resident dean to deal with the “academic impact.” While resident deans, proctors, and Peer Advising Fellows contribute to a larger network of support in order to close this gap, it can be hard to understand how to utilize this system when you are new on campus.
The issue first-year students face when dealing with sickness is not a lack of adequate resources, but rather a limited understanding of what exactly is available and how to access those things.
Harvard must bridge this wide information gap among its younger students. First-year Orientation is the perfect platform for such a conversation to take place and doing so would likely decrease the stress around contracting an illness on campus. Helping students navigate illness on campus is more than providing a brief overview of HUHS in an orientation module or requiring students to get flu and Covid-19 vaccines before the semester ends. It’s increasing awareness about the process for ordering bagged meals from Annenberg, offering specific examples of what your proctor can assist you with while sick, and clearly defining how to report a sickness-related absence (if HUHS has not yet confirmed your diagnosis or been able to see you for an appointment, for instance).
Dealing with sickness in college presents a learning curve. While some might argue that this experience presents an opportunity to develop one’s sense of independence and personal accountability, taking the time to make Harvard’s resources widely known makes it easier for students to learn to tackle such a situation on their own. Given the prevalence of the “freshman flu,” a more comprehensive orientation event and guide to handling sickness as a Harvard first-year seem a worthwhile project.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I had a wonderful morning routine last fall. None of my classes started until half past 10, so I would emerge, well-rested, at half past eight to conquer the day. I’d find myself outside the doors of Leverett F Tower by around 9:30 a.m., with enough time to do some reading before class. At around this time, I started putting on Tefillin, a Jewish ritual object intended to remind us of faith by binding God’s words upon our hands. This simple action gave me the first kind of daily structure to counter my leisureful tendencies. It took me about 10 minutes to put on the Tefillin, say the Shema prayer, and then put the Tefillin away. On particularly lazy mornings, this meant I had to get out of bed right when my alarm went off if I was going to have any time to read before class.
It wasn’t until the spring semester that the binding of my day really started to occur. Over Winter Break, I spoke with my Rabbi at home about how to broaden my prayers and learn more rules about prayer. Generously, he donated to me a weekday Siddur, a Jewish prayer book, with commentaries on what each prayer means and advice for having proper intentions. From then on, I expanded the prayers I would say each morning from just the Shema to also include the Shmonei Esrei (or Amidah), which is the central prayer of the Jewish liturgy, and other smaller prayers. This meant that each morning I spent about half an hour praying.
More significant than the expanded time of the prayers were the new restrictions I began to observe about when I could say them. The Shema is said twice a day, but it must be within specified time ranges to fulfill our obligations. This range is not constant throughout the year, but rather changes with the sun. As the sun rises earlier, we must say it earlier, and as the sun rises later, we can’t say it until later.
Prayer is far from the only part of Jewish practice that is tied to natural cycles. The phases of the moon dictate when there will be a new month or holiday; the blossoming of fruit trees in the spring gives us the opportunity to say a new blessing. We also say a blessing when it thunders or there is a rainbow, and countless other occasions.
In modern times, we have grown very distant from what is around us. While walking through Washington D.C., I noticed a coldness to its rational city planning. It was as if the abstraction of the metric system had been translated onto streets and buildings. Everything was where it was supposed to be, but nothing was naturally adapted to human experience. The National Mall, for example, looked perfect, but it was too big and sparse to be comfortable for a person.
The upcoming end of daylight savings shows how dependent we are on the abstract as opposed to the apparent. Seven a.m. only means what time things are scheduled on Google Calendar. We don’t wake up because it is light outside or go to sleep because it is dark; we have replaced nature with artifice.
Obviously, there is value in a globalized modern society of standardizing many things, and I don’t suggest getting rid of it. It would be impractical for every state to start having their own weights, measures, and currency.
Nevertheless, there are flaws in both extremes. For example, during the French Revolution, the republicans adjusted the calendar so that each month would have exactly 30 days, each week would have 10 days, each day would have 10 hours, and each hour 100 minutes. These times make more sense from a purely rational perspective. However, abstract reasoning is not the only thing that matters. We live within a natural world, and sometimes we forget that.
Through tying myself to the phases of the moon and the length of sunlight in a day, and deriving awareness of all the things which I can see and hear with my own eyes and ears as being significant, I feel much more at home. When we make everything divisible by 10, and all streets perfectly gridded regardless of the landscape or organic development of neighborhoods, we impose ourselves on the world rather than act as participants within it. Maybe bending one’s life around random occurrences or natural phenomena is inane, but it makes everything that happens have real meaning in our lives.

UPDATED: October 26, 2022, at 3:03 p.m.
Ashton B. Carter, director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center and former U.S. Defense Secretary, has died at 68.
Carter died after suffering a heart attack Monday evening, according to a statement announcing his death from HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf.
Carter started his career at the Kennedy School in 1984, but left in 1993 to serve in the Defense Department under former President Bill Clinton. He returned to HKS in 1996 and taught at the school until 2009, when President Barack Obama appointed him to the No. 3 post in the Department of Defense. Carter was later selected to serve as the 25th Secretary of Defense in 2015, the third and final Defense secretary of Obama’s presidency. Carter returned to the Kennedy School’s faculty for a third time in 2017, when he was appointed director of the Belfer Center.
Elmendorf wrote in a statement to the school that Carter’s “loss is so sudden and so devastating.”
“Ash Carter has been an important leader of the Kennedy School during the past five years — supporting faculty recruitment, helping to expand our curriculum on technology and public policy, creating a project called Technology and Public Purpose, and partnering with me in various collaborative efforts,” Elmendorf wrote.
Carter was “devoted to our students” and assisted in raising funds at the Kennedy School in order to support fellowships for students, Elmendorf wrote.
“He said that one key reason he returned here was his experience at the Defense Department of visiting abroad and being greeted with the salutation ‘Hello Professor Carter’ from his former students—so he wanted to come back and work with more students,” Elmendorf wrote.
Tributes to Carter continued to pour in throughout the day on Tuesday.
President Joe Biden wrote in a statement that Carter was guided “by a strong, steady moral compass and a vision of using his life for public purpose.”
“Ash was a leader on all the major national security issues of our times – from nuclear deterrence to proliferation prevention to missile defense to emerging technology challenges to the fight against Al Qaida and ISIS. He opened every field of military service to women and protected the rights of transgender service members,” Biden wrote.
Former President Barack Obama wrote that Carter’s “greatest legacy ... may be the generations of younger leaders he taught, mentored, and inspired to protect our nation and wield power wisely.”
Elmendorf wrote that the Kennedy School will provide an update about plans for a memorial service at a later date.
Carter is survived by his wife, Stephanie, and two children, Ava and Will.

Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) called for young voters to participate in the upcoming midterm elections in a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Tuesday, saying that “democracy is on the ballot in 2022.”
During the event, Markey said American democracy is “under assault,” citing the rise of extremist politics and the Supreme Court’s decision to revoke the constitutional right to abortion. He emphasized the role young people will play in determining the outcome of the midterm elections and the future of democracy in the United States.
Markey said young people have historically wielded significant political influence, citing examples including gun laws and climate bills.
“Young people were concerned about gun safety laws, and they marched, and were able to pass the first gun safety laws in 25 years,” he said. “That’s young people who were standing up.”
Markey said high voter turnout among young people is especially important in light of the issues at stake.
“Voting rights. Climate change. Gun safety. A woman’s right to choose,” he said. “None of it is safe if democracy does not work.”
He added that he fears a Republican-controlled House and Senate would conduct “one constant investigation of the Biden administration” in search of scandal, rather than continuing to pass legislation.
Markey alleged that Republicans do not have a plan to manage record-high inflation or create jobs.
“All they’re doing is attacking what we had to do during the worst recession since the 1930s,” he said.
He argued Republicans use social media to advance the rhetoric that American democracy needs to be saved through drastic measures, such as the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. But Markey believes “America has never been better than it is right now.”
When asked about the future of American politics, Markey said he remains ambivalent but confident in the power of voters.
“I’m not an optimist or a pessimist,” he said. “The outcome is only going to be determined by young people and old who decide they’re going to take part in this historic debate that we’re having.”
Markey encouraged attendees to continue organizing and engaging in politics, saying “we have much more work to do.”
“Politics is not for sprinters. It’s a marathon,” he added.

United States Senator Tim M. Kaine (D-Va.) discussed his experience with prolonged health problems from Covid-19 and his work pushing for public health-related bills in the Senate in an online stream through the Harvard School of Public Health Tuesday.
Kaine spoke with Politico reporter Alice M. Ollstein about his work in the Senate spreading awareness of the effects of “long Covid,” the national decline in mental health, and the importance of public health data sharing. The virtual talk was part of HSPH’s series “Public Health on the Brink.”
After contracting Covid-19 in March 2020, Kaine — who currently serves on the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions — said he still experiences the effects of the disease.
“Every nerve ending in my body suddenly felt like it had five cups of coffee or was dipped in an Alka-Seltzer,” Kaine said. “This nerve tingling issue that I have has never gone away.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes “post-Covid conditions” — colloquially known as long Covid — as an umbrella term for any health complications that manifest upon contracting Covid-19 and remain for more than four weeks after infection with the virus.
Thirteen percent of patients reported having symptoms more than one month after infection, while 2.5 percent of patients self-reported that symptoms were still present more than three months after infection.
Kaine also said some of his other colleagues in Congress suffer from long Covid, but that his pushes for further research have not yet gained enough momentum to pass through the Senate.
Addressing a different long-term consequence of Covid-19, Kaine said the “mental health shocks” of the pandemic “reverberated everywhere,” adding that the impact on healthcare professionals was particularly profound.
“We got to get to the point where we can have discussions about mental health issues,” he said.
Looking ahead at solutions to these issues, Kaine said he believes the United States needs to improve sharing of health data between states and the federal government.
“We have information in a lot of places, but it’s often not shared,” Kaine said. “Our response to many issues is really hobbled by the fact that we don’t have good data sharing among the different levels of government.”
In March, Kaine introduced the Improving Data Accessibility Through Advancements in Public Health Act to standardize and improve the content of public health data and make data sharing processes more efficient.
“What we’re tending to find now is that we’re relying on studies coming out of the UK or Israel because they have nationwide, comprehensive healthcare systems where they can pull data and then share with us,” he said.
Kaine stated his support for the Affordable Care Act and recalled the day that Republicans attempted to repeal the ACA in August 2017 but fell short by one vote in the Senate as one of his most memorable moments as a senator.
“If 30 million people had lost their health insurance in August 2017, it would have been a hell of a lot worse,” he said.

The city of Boston approved a $1.2 billion Fort Point development this month that is set to create residential, office, and biolab spaces as well as a large public park and amphitheater.
The plan, proposed by developer Related Beal, aims to transform a parking lot along the Fort Point Channel into 1.1 million square feet of residential, retail, commercial, and public space, while also contributing to affordable housing and local arts and culture initiatives in the neighborhood.
Related Beal’s predecessor company, the Beal Companies, facilitated Harvard’s land purchases in Allston during the 1990s, allowing the University to buy $90 million in land while remaining undetected.
Stephen N. Faber, Related Beal’s executive vice president, said in a press release the development will help transform the neighborhood.
“The collective resources brought to bear on this now vacant parking lot will create one of the most dynamic, inventive and exciting places to work, live and innovate,” Faber said. “Channelside will be a place at the intersection of art, science and nature for the entire city.”
The developer’s proposal featured a package of public benefits for the Fort Point neighborhood, including a $3.7 million public art program that would reserve at least 25 percent of its funding for BIPOC and female artists. Related Beal also pledged a combined $1.07 million in area transportation improvements, including $500,000 to the MBTA for bus route funding.
Related Beal pledged that 20 percent of the housing created by the development would be affordable, of which 75 percent would be reserved for living and working space for neighborhood artists.
The Fort Point development received backing from some local elected officials, including United States Representative Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.) and Boston City Councilors Edward Flynn and Michael F. Flaherty.
The resident engagement process began in 2019, with two in-person community open houses in the months following Related Beal’s May 2019 purchase of the property. The majority of this outreach, however, took place amid the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing a shift to meetings over Zoom.
Rocco Giuliano, a Fort Point resident, said in an interview that the switch to virtual meetings during the pandemic made it difficult for residents to communicate and engage in the planning process.
Another resident, Debra O’Toole, wrote in an August 2020 public comment to the developer that she saw the virtual meeting process as a barrier to participation for many residents.
“Allowing this development process to move forward on ‘zoom’ is preventing public participation,” O’Toole wrote. “You are squeezing out the participation of older people who do not feel comfortable with rushed technology to do business.”
Giuliano, a member of a local artists’ cooperative, added that he and other residents were upset that the development process would involve the destruction of 39 honey locust trees on the property. With the project approved, the trees are set to be chopped down.
Giuliano said he helped put up 200 Tibetan prayer flags in an attempt to “spare the spirit of the trees” — though he said he no longer expected community advocacy to succeed in protecting them.
“I think the day will come when they will bring out the chainsaws and the heavy duty earthmoving equipment and just destroy it all,” Giuliano said. “I find that disappointing.”
The project is now set to undergo approval steps due to its location along the channel. According to the Related Beal’s press release, construction is expected to begin next year.

Voting rights advocates discussed ongoing litigation at the intersection of racial justice and voting rights at a virtual event hosted by the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning on Tuesday.
Co-sponsored by the VPAL, the Harvard Alumni Association, and Harvard Law School’s Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, the talk featured CHHI Strategic Litigation and Advocacy director Alora Thomas-Lundborg in conversation with American Civil Liberties Union attorney Davin M. Rosborough. The pair discussed a number of ongoing Supreme Court cases with potential implications for voting rights across the country.
During the event, Rosborough described two types of claims — vote dilution and vote denial — that are often brought forth when contesting the application of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Vote dilution deals with redistricting and relative representation of voters. Vote denial refers to “restrictions that affect your opportunity to participate in the political process equally,” including restrictive voter ID laws and precinct closures, per Rosborough.
In his discussion of vote dilution, Rosborough spoke about Merrill v. Milligan, a Supreme Court case challenging the constitutionality of Alabama’s redistricting plan following the 2020 census. Rosborough said that Alabama has “limited Black voting power to just one district, despite Black Alabamians making up about 27 percent of voters in the state.”
“Voting in Alabama is extremely racially polarized still, meaning that Black-preferred candidates and white-preferred candidates are different candidates,” Rosborough said.
Rosborough, who anticipates a decision from the Supreme Court on Merrill v. Milligan between March and June 2023, said the court’s decision to take up the case “really made clear that they were interested in reconsidering things.”
In response to a question on voter fraud, Thomas-Lundborg said that some states have passed restrictions to prevent voter impersonation, though she noted those cases are uncommon.
“The idea that we need to make it more difficult for something that is exceedingly rare has always kind of just blown my mind a little bit,” Thomas-Lundborg said. “In fact, not just voter ID, but there are lots of things we do to make voting really difficult — like having it on a Tuesday, when a lot of people are working.”
The speakers also discussed Moore v. Harper, an upcoming Supreme Court case on partisan gerrymandering under the “free and fair” election clause of the North Carolina constitution. In February, the state’s supreme court struck down the redistricting plan on the basis that extreme partisan gerrymandering violates the state’s election clause.
Rosborough said one of North Carolina’s main arguments is the “independent state legislature doctrine,” which theorizes that state courts do not have a role in federal elections given that time, place, and manner are determined by state legislatures.
“That’s really what that case concerns – whether state courts and state Supreme Courts can enforce their own state constitutions, or whether state legislatures basically get the free rein to do whatever they want, irrespective of the state constitution,” Rosborough said.
During the virtual event, Thomas-Lundborg cited an anecdote in which she had to continually explain American voting restrictions to her Swedish in-laws.
“I cannot explain to my in-laws what I do, because when I try to explain to them about the restrictions that we have on the right to vote, it just blows their mind,” Thomas-Lundborg said. “When I think about our system compared to other democracies, no one else has a system that is as difficult to participate in as ours.”

A Boston man was sentenced on Oct. 5 to 10 years in prison for conspiring to distribute fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine — some of which was delivered to a Harvard biology lab.
Former FedEx employee Dorian Rojas, 38, pleaded guilty in federal court on March 1 to one count of conspiracy to distribute more than 400 grams of fentanyl, more than 100 grams of heroin, and more than 500 grams of cocaine and one count of possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of heroin.
Following his release from prison, Rojas will be subject to five years of supervision by a probation officer.
In June 2019, a package containing one kilogram of fentanyl and one kilogram of cocaine was recovered by law enforcement from a biology lab on Harvard’s campus. Rojas had asked another FedEx delivery driver Lennon Carrasco to retrieve the package and deliver it to him. The following August, Rojas asked Carrasco to retrieve another package, which contained almost one kilogram of heroin.
Carrasco pleaded guilty on April 13 to one count of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 10.
Julie-Ann Olson, a federal public defender who represented Rojas during his trial, did not respond to requests for comment.
The prosecution of Rojas and Carrasco was part of a broader anti-narcotics initiative by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, a coalition launched in 1982 to combat drug trafficking organizations.
Rojas received the mandatory minimum sentence for the charges against him. During the sentencing process, ten of Rojas’ family and friends wrote letters of recommendation asking the judge to show leniency.
In a memorandum to the court, Rojas asked for the minimum sentence, noting he had no criminal background. He described his childhood growing up in the Dominican Republic and playing baseball with St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols, who Rojas described as a “big brother.”
According to the memo, Rojas’ baseball career in the United States was cut short by a career-ending shoulder injury, which led to significant financial difficulties that ultimately drove Rojas to the trade of narcotics.
In one of the letters, Michael Hoadley, Rojas’ longtime friend and former baseball teammate, praised Rojas for mentoring his son.
“I appreciate the mentor Dorian has been to my son, the friend he is to me and the leader he has been to so many,” Hoadley wrote. “I am forever grateful for the day we met.”
Co-founder of the Boston Athletic Academy and former Red Sox player Manuel “Manny” Delcarmen wrote to the court about Rojas’ passion for baseball and the support he provided throughout Delcarmen’s career.
“We the Boston athletic academy need Dorian Rojas,” Delcarmen wrote. “He is a great person. He has always been a good teammate. But most of all he is a close friend we all see him as family.”
“Please give him an opportunity to show you he made a mistake and give him a second chance to help me and others better our city,” Delcarmen added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s campus greenhouse gas emissions remained stagnant for the sixth straight year in 2021, despite the University’s ambitious plans to eliminate fossil fuels from its operations by 2050.
Harvard has pledged to make its campus fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050. But the amount of carbon emitted on campus has remained flat since 2016, according to data released earlier this semester as part of the University’s annual sustainability report.
Still, University officials say Harvard is on pace to meet its goals.
“The University is on track to become fossil fuel-free by 2050 and fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and will do so by addressing four key components: its District Energy Systems, its standalone buildings, its purchased energy supply, and its fleet vehicles,” Harvard spokesperson Amy Kamosa wrote in a statement Tuesday.
Harvard met a key initial sustainability target in 2016, when it reduced campus emissions by 30 percent from a 2006 baseline. But its carbon output has remained the same ever since, despite the 2018 pledge by then-University President Drew G. Faust to eliminate fossil fuels entirely by 2050.
The sustainability report noted that the square footage of Harvard’s campus has grown by 14 percent since 2006.
Harvard has offset some of its emissions by purchasing renewable energy from offsite sources. In 2021, the school offset approximately 3,000 Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent — down from approximately 5,000 MTCDE in 2020.
Harvard’s 2014 University-wide sustainability plan — which outlined goals for reductions in waste, water usage, and carbon emissions, among other things — expired in 2020. The school has not published updated sustainability goals, missing a self-set target to do so “by 2022.”
Harvard’s trash generation fell to 4,558 tons in 2021 — down 50 percent from a 2006 baseline. But the report said the reductions were largely “due to the de-densification of Harvard’s campus during the Covid-19 pandemic.”
“These numbers are not reflective of a trend,” the report said.
Net energy usage rose slightly in 2021, due in part to Covid-19 precautions, according to the report.
“Some safety-driven changes in building operations resulted in increased energy use, such as higher building ventilation rates per recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local guidance and standards pertinent to COVID-19,” the report said. “These changes impacted the University’s GHG emissions and energy use, altering trends compared to previous years.”
Kamosa, the Harvard spokesperson, said the school is looking to alternative energy sources to meet its fossil fuel reduction goals, but did not outline a specific path to the pledged reductions.
“Harvard’s plans involve evaluating a variety of technology solutions for transitioning the University energy systems off fossil fuels over time, including electrification opportunities, green hydrogen, and other innovative solutions,” Kamosa wrote. “The University is continually working to build and operate a campus that contributes to the well-being of every member of the community—and ultimately to the health of the planet for future generations.”

You live in Winthrop, and your friend in Mather has vanished and has not been seen since the Head of the Charles. When HUPD was searching her room, they found an old, creepy doll that did seem out of place. It’s late at night, and you’re getting sleepy after a long day of lectures. What do you do?

Mostly C’s: You Die in the Middle of Your Chem 17 Midterm
