After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The European Union has always been polarizing as an ideal and a work in progress, but increasingly, the institution appears to be broadly disliked by its constituents. While the rise of the E.U. was always likely to produce a Eurosceptic, nationalist backlash, it has also led to more unforeseen and still scarcely talked-about consequences. Here is one: Over the past two decades the E.U. has diluted existing nation-states' sovereignty and promoted a supra-national sense of belonging, and thus it has actually helped revive and legitimize historic ethno-regionalist causes. And this is taking place right in the heart of austere, ‘Old World’ Europe, as opposed to a collapsing Eastern Bloc in 1990. Chief among these examples are pro-European parties in Flanders and Scotland, which want independence from Belgium and the United Kingdom.
In June 2010, Belgium's most recent elections produced a surprising victory for the New Flemish Alliance, which favours the gradual but decisive break-up of the country. Of course, Belgium has always been one of the most “artificial” and divided nations of modern Europe. Created in 1830 by joining Flanders, with its distinct Flemish identity and heritage, to French-speaking Wallonia under a French monarch and aristocracy, the country has never really fit together. Dutch-speaking Flanders' long struggle for independence hit a dark patch when many Flemings fought with Nazi Germany during World War II.
The sudden popularity of the New Flemish Alliance is attributable to several factors. Traditional linguistic divisions have sharpened in recent years and been complemented by the increasing frustration of wealthy Flanders at having to bail out the far-less prosperous Wallonia, which has been dogged for some time by deindustrialization and internal corruption. Meanwhile, the New Flemish Alliance is notable for its commitment to European integration and attempt to shed the racism of prior Flemish nationalism. Indeed, the motto of the party's platform translates roughly to “Needed in Flanders. Useful in Europe.” With Brussels, the seat of the E.U., so integrated into the supra-national body, it is easy to see how Flemish independence seems sensible and reasonable.
The argument for Scottish independence from Britain is, likewise, by no means a new one. But nationalism today influences Scottish politics much more than it did only 15 years ago. In 1997, the Scottish public voted overwhelmingly in favour of the devolution of many powers to Scotland, away from London, and after 2007 elections, the Scottish National Party managed to form a government, leaving the long-term future of the U.K. in unprecedented uncertainty. This was contrary to Tony Blair's expectation that devolution would help kill off Scottish nationalism.
Defying stereotypes of nationalist ideology by advocating a liberal philosophy, the SNP stands for an independent Scotland further integrating itself within the E.U. The party supported the Euro from the start, and its governing administration has attempted to define Scotland as a humane and peaceful society, preparing to release the Libyan terrorist Abdul al-Megrahi while vociferously opposing Britain's role in the Iraq War. At an electoral level, the Nationalists have set themselves against the populist rhetoric of the Labour Party and the sectarian tendency with which British Unionism can remain associated. It’s the type of nationalism Europe hasn’t seen in a very long time.
As the E.U. chips away at national sovereignty, with the introduction of the Euro in 2001 or the brand new appointments of a President and Foreign Minister (the former himself a Flemish Belgian) in late 2009, it naturally becomes harder and harder for countries like Belgium to maintain an already precarious national self-image. People who have always tended toward regional identities find it easier to do so as the E.U. diminishes the role of the nation both in popular imagination and in giving people a sense of safety. Earlier, in the last century, Scotland would have found splitting from England a daunting task. But the E.U. didn't really exist then as it does now. Today, belonging to an international union of half a billion people, especially one whose structure is designed to give small countries a say, actually allows groups to get more tribal, not less.
If you're an ardent British or Belgian unionist, it's not great news. Independence wouldn't be good for Scotland, while a Belgian break-up would be a disaster for Wallonia. All in all though, it's just another side-effect for a part of the world that could end up being far less stable in the coming decades than many in the United States expect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the simple stroke of her pen, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed into law on Apr. 23 the most far-reaching, controversial anti-immigrant law in the country. The bill criminalized almost 460,000 unauthorized immigrants for trespassing on Arizona soil, turned local police authorities into immigration enforcers, and made lawbreakers out of United States citizens who invite immigrants they know to be “illegal aliens” to have dinner in their homes, drive them to church, teach them in school, or otherwise “harbor” them.
This harsh, uncompromising piece of legislation aimed to identify, prosecute, and deport illegal immigrants solely on the basis of suspicion. Since its inception, it has rapidly led to a surge of protests and brought the issue of immigration reform to the forefront of national debate.  The law as it stands effectively allowed the police force to operate in a racist manner in order to execute the tenets of the legislation, as people are required to carry proof of legal status at all times. Additionally, people were granted the right to sue local governments and agencies who they feel are not effectively enforcing state and federal immigration laws. In all respects, the passing of this immigration bill further alienated immigrants, jeopardized the trust between citizens and the police force, and actually challenged the fundamentally just nature of our Constitution by being an open invitation for legalized harassment and discrimination against the immigrant community.
The mere act of forming assumptions based on suspicion characterizes racial profiling. This law enabled the propagation of pervasive stereotypes that the American system strives to eliminate. As it is there is a high record of police brutality and violence directed toward Latino communities in heavily immigrant-populated regions like Arizona. It seems that this law relies heavily on theory, placing an unrealistic amount of trust in law enforcement officials to remove prejudice and discriminatory attitudes from the law. Realistically speaking, however, there is no legitimate plan for enforcing this seriously flawed piece of legislation. The bill requires police officers to detain those whom they believe have committed “any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States” without even a warrant for arrest. This law thus clearly demands its officers to be agents of racial profiling.
There will be an additional strain on relations between Arizona and Mexico in the wake of this ruthless immigration law. In stigmatizing an entire population, Arizona has invited serious ramifications for its unjustly actions. Ties with Mexico have already been endangered, as the country has closed the commercial traffic border with Arizona, and in a published statement, the Mexican government asserts that this “measure could impair commercial, touristic, cultural and friendly ties ‘that have characterized the relationship of Mexico with Arizona’.” Likewise, in a show of solidarity with the targeted immigrant population in Arizona, the city of San Francisco has called for an extensive boycott of Arizona, hoping that severing ties with the state will send a clear message about the need for sweeping reform of the proposed bill. Similarly, other groups have begun to demand a boycott of the state, including a call for Major League Baseball to “step up to the plate” and boycott Arizona.
This bill is an unadulterated example of discrimination and serves to ostracize a particular group of people—Latino immigrants working and trying to survive in Arizona. It is likely that police enforcement will naturally overlook the other Russian, Polish, and Canadian immigrants that can adapt more easily to the American image and pretense. As the first state to demand that immigrants meet federal requirements to validate their presence in America, Arizona has strained any possibility for community trust in the police force, not only among immigrants but also among national allies. It is classified as a state offense—a misdemeanor—to be without immigration papers when asked to present such documents by a police officer.
For those legal citizens who happen to forget their papers, they are out of luck in the eyes of Arizona law, which calls for the arrest and detainment of such individuals. Immigrants will not want to cooperate with police in any capacity and this pervasive fear is more detrimental than beneficial to the intended progress on immigration reform that this bill seeks to advance.
It is utterly prejudiced and undue law enforcement to sanction such controversial legislation. For those red-blooded, hard-working people looking to survive in an environment where all odds are pitted against them, can the immigrant in Arizona ever begin to live the American dream? Definitely not as long as this unconstitutional piece of legislation is still enforced.

The autopsy reports on Owen E. Thomas, a Penn junior and football player who hung himself last April, have come out, with surprising results. Thomas was discovered to have a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disease caused by the sort of repetitive head injury that is all too common in sports like football.
Prior to these findings, C.T.E. had not been discovered in an amateur football player. It was not considered a risk to players outside the N.F.L., though it has been linked to depression, dementia, and impulse control. Tragically, Boston University doctors believe that it probably played a role in Thompson’s suicide.
Thomas’ parents acted admirably in coming forward with the results of their son’s autopsy and opening a new dialogue on what is surely a painful subject. The discovery of C.T.E. in a college-level athlete has important implications for the sport of football and the way injuries ought to be dealt with at an amateur level. The public has a right to know that C.T.E. can affect amateur athletes as well as professionals.
Because C.T.E. is a damaging disease with life-long effects, even with the very little that is known about C.T.E.’s effects at the amateur level, the evidence given by the Thomas case requires drastic and immediate action to curb the potential damage to college and even high school athletes in the future.
We believe that the best way to begin such an effort is with education of parents and players about the risk of playing football and other rough contact sports. Many athletes are unaware that, even as college athletes with the proper pads, they can sustain the sort of repetitive damage that leads to C.T.E.
Another important step, and one that would take more time but also supply a more long-term solution to this problem, is investing in new and better helmets for players. The root cause of C.T.E. is the brain slamming against the skull, a common occurrence in a game filled with hard hits. A helmet that could minimize the force of the shock that gets transmitted down to a player’s head to a greater degree than the helmets currently available could go a long way toward alleviating this problem.
To combat the possibility of further damage done to amateur players by this disease, institutional changes need to be made at the college and even at the high school level. A simple way to do so is to mandate screening for brain damage resembling C.T.E. prior to each season to minimize the risk that players who are already hurt will worsen their condition.
Unfortunately, even such testing has serious failings. Far too frequently, coaches and team trainers are motivated by pressures that lead them to skimp in areas where an athlete’s health is concerned. This is not to say that all coaches, or even most, are guilty of ignoring their athletes’ health concerns to try and win a game. Yet the fact that a coach’s job security depends far more on how his team performs in key games than how healthy his team is at the end of the season demonstrates a conflict of interest between the coach’s job security and players’ health.
One way to minimize the effects of a conflict of interest like this is to mandate that medical personnel not associated with the team examine all head injuries and that the doctors’ orders be followed exactly, treated as law rather than suggestion.
Universities and high schools have an obligation to their athletes—many of whom attend the school because they were recruited to play a sport—to protect them from preventable damage that could plague them the rest of their lives. Strong action needs to be taken to educate players about the risk of C.T.E., protect them better on the field, and force teams to follow doctors’ orders.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
 
CORRECTION: September 17, 2010 
An earlier version of the Sept. 17 staff editorial "Strong Safety" used the wrong surname when referring to Owen E. Thomas.

Since Sept. 11, the interfaith movement has grown exponentially in American cities, towns, and college campuses, including Harvard.  Among these interfaith initiatives, is the Cordoba Initiative of Feisal Abdul Rauf.  So how is it that one of America's leading Muslim advocates of closer interfaith relations between Muslims, Christians, and Jews is now at the center of the controversy dubbed "the mosque at Ground Zero?"   Many Americans heard Imam Feisal Rauf in person for the first time on CNN just last week. But those of us involved in interfaith work have heard him for many years. His book, “What's Right with Islam is What's Right with America,” has been read in classes, like my own, and in book clubs and study groups. I first met Imam Rauf when both of us spoke at an interfaith forum at the United Nations some five years ago. He was excited then about the Cordoba Initiative, a vision that comes from the period in the history of Spain when Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived together in cultural and religious harmony and creativity. It was called the convivencia, the "living together." Now more than ever, we need a new era of convivencia—especially here in the U.S.   The creation of Cordoba House was to be a place for that vision, and it was a plan that won the support of Jewish leaders, such as Rabbi Arthur Schneier of the Park East Synagogue and Rabbi Joy Levitt of the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan, as well as Christian leaders in the city's seminaries and the National Council of Churches. When the plan for Cordoba House was announced last December, Imam Rauf said, "We want to push back against the extremists." He has walked that walk for many years.
Much has been made of polls that report that three out of five New Yorkers oppose a mosque or Muslim center near Ground Zero. But why was that the question to begin with? What if the question had been about support or opposition to an interfaith center near Ground Zero, a center that would bring people together across some of the deepest lines of division in our society and our world?  Would they have responded the same way? That is, after all, what the Cordoba Initiative has always been—a bridge-building interfaith initiative.
For years, many of the interfaith initiatives in the U.S. and worldwide have been sponsored by Christian churches, often arousing the suspicion among Muslims that interfaith is just another form of mission.  In the past few years, however, it has been heartening to see major Muslim initiatives of outreach, such as the Common Word project, launched in 2007 with an open letter to Christian leaders signed by more than 300 Muslim leaders across the spectrum of the Muslim world from Indonesia to Indiana. It asked Christians to join with them in affirming the most important  "common word" of Scripture—the love of God and the love of neighbor. Imam Feisal Rauf was one of the first signatories.  It began, "Muslims and Christians together make up well over half of the world’s population. Without peace and justice between these two religious communities, there can be no meaningful peace in the world." This letter has led to a sustained and in-depth exchange between Christians and Muslims, one that continues today.
By the way, the Cordoba Initiative also involves Feisal's wife, Daisy Khan, whose American Society for Muslim Advancement, is to be part of the project. ASMA is "dedicated to strengthening an authentic expression of Islam in America, based on cultural and religious harmony through interfaith collaboration, youth and women’s empowerment, and arts and cultural exchange." One of Daisy's projects has been the Women's Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equity, aimed at empowering Muslim women to play a greater role in their societies worldwide. In sum, the life's work of both Feisal Rauf and Daisy Khan has been dedicated to fostering better relations between Islam and the West.
In the midst of this media maelstrom, we all need to ask some serious questions: How did this Cordoba vision become dubbed "the mosque at Ground Zero?" What political interests are at stake in perpetuating this public controversy, long after the official bodies of the city of New York have given it resounding approval? If it is really about "sensitivity" and "proximity to Ground Zero," why are protesters holding signs with the words "Sharia" lettered in red and dripping with blood? Why the rise of a frightening spate of Islamophobia just now?
The Pluralism Project at Harvard has followed the targeting of progressive Muslim leaders in America for the past 20 years. What has happened to Feisal Rauf is not new. It is part of a deeply disturbing and continuing pattern of groundless accusation, guilt by association, and the distortion of both words and motives. All these suspicions find fertile soil in which to grow, given the general inexperience most Americans have with Muslims, Muslim communities, and the Islamic faith. Now, more than ever, we need just the kind of Cordoba House that Feisal Rauf proposes—and we need one in every city and town in America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While working in a bioinformatics lab in Shanghai this summer, Andrew Chen ’12 learned to sterilize his own pipettes and prepare his own agarose gels—a needless practice in most American laboratories, where scientists have room in their budgets to buy fresh pipettes and industry-produced gels.
As Chen learned, Chinese scientists are more strapped for funding than their American counterparts—and reusing in-house equipment was a clear cost-saving measure.
“We are spoiled in American labs,” said Chen, who researched at Fudan University as part of Harvard’s life sciences summer school program in Shanghai. “In China, you have to autoclave pipette tips yourself, rather than getting them sterilized from a company.”
Working alongside other Chinese undergraduates, Chen spent weeks researching the mechanisms by which mice detect carbon dioxide—a function humans do not have.
Apart from funding disparities, Chen, and other Harvard students researching at the University, found that incongruities with American research practices largely ended there: the Chinese researchers they encountered had the same core considerations when it came to sound scientific practice and experimental design.
“Resources are limited, you see it every day in the lab,” said Yannis K. Valtis ’12, who made a habit of recycling pipette tips while conducting epigenetics research in Shanghai. “Yet the intellectual aspect of it, the scientific aspect of it, was very rigorous, totally comparable to the United States.”
Indeed, both American students were struck by the expertise of their Chinese peers—Valtis said when his lab had journal club or scientific discussions, the students were well acquainted with the material.
“The amount of information the average Fudan student has memorized is incredible,” he said. In the Chinese education system, students specialize much sooner and attend medical school directly after high school.
The proficiency of the Chinese students was critical in Chen’s case, when he and two Chinese students were charged with designing an experiment from scratch—uncommon in the United States, where undergraduates usually assist with or build off of existing projects.
“The experience as a whole was really good because a lot of American students don’t get to struggle through the design of an experiment,” Chen said.
After a lot of trial and error, Chen and the Chinese students used computer modeling software to virtually alter various structural aspects of a protein integral to carbon dioxide detection.
They then analyzed the impact of those structural manipulations on the protein’s function in carbon dioxide detection.
Such table-top collaboration spilled into the classroom, where the Harvard summer school students worked side by side with their Chinese peers to address questions about the relationship of medicine, statistics, and the social sciences.
Eric Lin ’12, one of the 12 Harvard students in the Shanghai program, took courses in biostatistics and the life sciences, working on projects about the effectiveness of Chinese lung cancer screening policies, the social consequences of the scientific “brain drain” in China, and the medical implications of an aging population.
These large social questions hit home in the classroom: when the Chinese students in Lin’s course were polled, eight out of nine said they wanted to come to the United States for a Ph.D.—the same percentage of American students said they wanted to pursue a graduate degree on home turf.
“The class showed me the widespread effects of life science research outside the purely scientific realm, which isn’t something you always realize when you are working in lab,” Lin said. “It does have effects on society, it is not an isolated pursuit.”

After spending two months studying the mind and brain in Italy this summer, Janelle S. Lambert ’12 said she felt like she was seeing the world through new eyes. Indeed, after a course on vision and perception, optical illusions jumped out at her right and left.
“On a class trip to Vicenza, we went to a theatre where the architect had built a stage that was really elaborate, and we noticed that its perception—floor going up and ceiling going down—made it look straight even though it was smaller in the back,” Lambert said.
This trick created the illusion of depth, making it appear that children along the back of the stage were adults standing far in the distance.
Optical illusions in theatres, old Roman streets, and even the Vatican were just one way that Lambert and her peers engaged with life in Italy while delving into neurobiology this summer.
The Mind/Brain/Behavior course she participated in, designed largely by psychology professor Alfonso Caramazza, who also directs a neuropsychology lab at Harvard and works at the University of Trento’s Center for Mind/Brain Sciences, brings students to Trento to study neurobiology, vision, art, and Italian.
In her first course, Lambert studied cognitive neuropsychology—including action potentials, language acquisition, and case studies of patients with brain lesions. Her second course, “Visual Neuroscience: From Sensory Input to Cognition,” was more specialized.
After class each day, a 10-minute bus ride brought Lambert to the city center in Trento, where she and classmates would plant themselves near a fountain or a church and—with the Alps framing the scene—crack open their reading.
The nine Italian students on the 24-student trip allowed for what Lambert called an interesting “cultural exchange,” as did the many Brazilian and African students at the local student café at the University of Trento.
“For a lot of the Italian students, the longest most of them had spoken English was two or three years,” Lambert said. “I took Italian for 6 years and I was nowhere at all near their level of fluency—I was really impressed.”
While Lambert used the weekends to venture to Venice, Florence, Naples, Pompeii, and other locations, the program set aside Fridays to embark on excursions—like hiking in the Alps or exploring the Lago di Garda, where “lake bled into sky” from her perch atop a mountain in a cable car one day.
She said the surroundings had a tangible effect on her mood and attitude towards learning.
“So much of how I felt, my disposition every day, was ‘I’m happy to be here, it’s so beautiful outside,’” she said.
Some students, like Jack L. Turban ’11, took an art-related class, “What Art Can Tell Us About the Brain,” as their second course. They learned from Wellesley professor Bevil Conway and Harvard Medical School professor Margaret S. Livingstone which visual phenomena cause the Mona Lisa to seem to smile when you look away, and how impressionists capture the “shimmering” effect in their paintings through colors of “equal value” (or “equal luminance,” as psychologists call it), among other topics.
In her teaching, Livingstone hunts for instances in which artists exploit visual phenomena, and she required that students do the same in Italy, which is rich in art history and museums.
“Once your eyes are open, it’s hard to go to a museum and not see it [artist’s use of visual phenomena], because artists are vision-scientists,” Livingstone said.
Turban is a Nuerobiology concentrator with a secondary in Dramatic Arts, but said he hadn’t seen a true connection between neurobiology and art before this course.
“It’s definitely tough because you traditionally think of art and science in different spheres, but through this course you come to understand they are not as distinct as is usually thought.”

This past summer, four Harvard students traveled to Tanzania to work with the private medical sector and propose ways to improve the quality of health care offered.
Rachel B. Bervell ’13, Byran Dai ’11, Anita J. Joseph ’12, and Peggy Su ’13 spent eight weeks in Tanzania working with the Association for Private Health Care Facilities.
The Association was founded in August 1994 to provide a forum for the discussion of different aspects of the nation’s private health care sector.
According to their website, the main objective of the organization is “to promote by all possible means and at all times the attainment of the highest possible physical and mental wellbeing of all people in Tanzania.”
Su said the students were unsure what project they needed to pursue upon arriving in Tanzania, but were inspired after shadowing a quality improvement officer to inspect and approve facilities.
“Health care needs are pretty different, so we created a quality assessment template which is nine categories long,” Su said. “It’s ways for health facilities to improve the quality of their care regardless of their size.”
The students worked with three types of facilities and created a template in which they would assess what the facilities had and what they needed.
These observations would then be used to compile a consulting report.
“The most important part of our project was that we gave them recommendations that didn’t cost any money,” she said. “They typically expect foreigners to tell them to do something that requires a lot of money.”
“Giving them ideas that are at low or no cost is an additional incentive to help have these recommendations come to fruition.”
The students became involved with the Association for Private Health Facilities in Tanzania through the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum.
They visited 23 hospitals during their stay and offered recommendations for 19 facilities.

It was her first time in Liberia, a country still suffering from the aftermath of the bloody civil wars nearly a decade ago. For Hemali A. Thakkar ’11, her summer trip began as senior thesis research and evolved into a larger community project with the potential to touch hundreds of lives.
Thakkar spent the first half of her trip in Zwedru, Liberia—a city that “hardly had any buildings over two stories tall”—traveling from house to house conducting interviews with patients suffering from depression.
In addition to interviews, Thakkar ran a project called Photo Voice, where she handed 15 patients a digital camera, asked them to take photos of anything that reminded them of the war, and then recorded the narratives behind the photos.
The idea behind the project is to provide an open-ended way for the patients to share their tragic experiences and to learn about the social and economic effects of the war. One photo shows two graves side by side, telling the story of a son who chose to remain behind with his crippled father even though rebel forces were arriving, recalled Thakkar.
“For someone who lives on two dollars a day, to be handed a camera and then personally trained how to use it meant a lot to them,” Thakkar said. “It was really amazing how resilient the population is, in terms of moving forward with their lives and trying better to provide for their kids.”
Thakkar’s project was conducted under the auspices of the NGO Tiyatien Health, founded in 2007, which runs rural community health centers in Liberia, including the largest rural AIDS center in the country. A sister organization to Partners in Health, Tiyatien “seeks to advance health care and fundamental rights of the poor, in partnership with the government and local communities,” said Rajesh R. Panjabi, the co-founder and executive director of the organization and currently a fellow at Harvard Medical School. “There is tremendous opportunities here to do something meaningful for the people we work with,” he said.
Thakkar said working with patients was one of the most rewarding aspects of her project, inspiring her to do more for the Liberian people.
“[The patients’] houses leak every time it rains, their kids can’t go to school, they don’t have a job—all these factors contribute to their depression…What I learned from the interviews is that just providing someone with antidepressants or some medicine isn’t enough,” Thakkar said. “It’s not a long-term solution to actually helping them improve their lives.”
With the lessons fresh in mind, Thakkar decided to become involved with the social and economic programs at the Tiyatien regional office during the second half of the summer. She is leading efforts to create what will be called the Liberia Social and Economic Empowerment Center, which will teach skills to help raise people out of poverty, including traditional trades such as soap-making and baking, and also newer concepts such as computer skills, business management, and accounting.
The 60-by-80 square-feet training center is currently under construction, using initial funding from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Thakkar said she hopes it will be finished within the next few months so she can return to Zwedru during J-term to launch the programs.
Thakkar also said she plans on taking a year off before medical school and spend a portion of that time working at Tiyatien to make sure the programs are running smoothly.
“I think of [the center] as a pilot. If we are in fact reducing poverty, we can present it to the Ministry, and we can expand it throughout Liberia,” said Thakkar.

Nataliya Nedzhvetskaya ’13 spent her summer conducting research in a genetics lab in Bonn, Germany.
Nedzhvetskaya’s journey to Bonn began earlier this year, during her freshman spring term when she applied to the Harvard College Summer Program there.
Interested in biomedical research, Nedzhvetskaya was drawn to the program because it offered her the opportunity to conduct research through Harvard in a new, exciting environment.
When informed of her acceptance into the program late in the spring, Nedzhvetskaya chose to work in the Hoch laboratory at the Life and Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute.
In the laboratory, Nedzhvetskaya’s time was spent investigating a gene in the species Drosophila melanogaster—the scientific name for the fruit fly—a common model organism used in biological research. The gene, Obst-A, was thought to affect the growth of Drosophila lungs.
“We were interested in studying how Drosophila lungs function because the system can be used to model how other organisms’ lungs function,” said Nedzhvetskaya of her work.
Under the supervision of her mentor, Dr. Mattias Behr, Nedzhvetskaya confirmed that the mutant Drosophila flies created via gene knockout did, in fact, have the correct mutations in the target gene.
Her results were positive, indicating that the prepared Drosophila models were indeed mutants.
As a result of Nedzhvetskaya’s efforts, research into the function of the obst gene family can now begin in earnest.
Outside of the laboratory, Nedzhvetskaya spent her time traveling to a number of European cities.  Outside of Germany, her travels included Paris, Amsterdam, and Brussels; and within Germany, they included Dresden, Dusseldorf, and Cologne.  Her favorite trip, though, was one she took to Stockholm, where she enjoyed a traditional Swedish dinner, eating crayfish with her host family.
Of her experience, Nedzhvetskaya says, “Most everyone in Germany is really friendly and welcoming.  My labmates also had a great sense of humor—obst means fruit in German, and Drosophila are fruit flies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rate of inflation affecting universities nationwide fell to 0.9 percent in fiscal year 2010—the lowest rate on record—and rates for institutions in New England dipped even lower, according to the Higher Education Price Index.
The numbers mean that costs incurred by universities rose at an unprecedented low rate during the year that ended June 30.
“It’s good for universities and for the consumers of the university’s product if in fact those costs are then reflected in the way the product is priced,” said William F. Jarvis, managing director of the Commonfund Institute, which compiled the data.
From 2009 to 2010, the cost of attendance at the College increased by 3.8 percent, nearly 3 percent more than the national average inflation rate.
Universities in the New England region faced a lower rate of inflation than all other regions for the year, with costs rising at about 0.4 percent. That rate is 3 percent lower than the previous year.
Human resources costs such as salaries and benefits comprise the single largest cost facing universities and increased 1.2 percent.
Costs for private universities increased at a slightly lower rate than public universities, with costs increasing at 0.5 and 0.9 percent respectively.
University financial officials could not be reached for comment late yesterday.
Over the same period, the Consumer Price Index—the national inflation rate—increased by 1 percent. The HEPI provides a more accurate picture of cost increases for universities as it uses a basket of goods that more accurately mirrors the goods and services purchased by institutions of higher education.
The Commonfund Institute, which has been publishing the report since 1961, found that the last time the inflation rate fell to comparable levels was in 2002 when the national economy was emerging from the bursting of the dot-com bubble.
But since that time, the costs facing universities have increased by about 25 percent.
The University reported late last week that its endowment had grown by 11 percent during fiscal year 2010, an increase of about $1.4 billion.
The previous year the endowment precipitously fell by 27 percent, resulting in steep budget cuts across the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the exposure of psychology professor Marc D. Hauser’s multiple instances of academic misconduct, the scientific community has quietly set out to review the relevant literature that may have been affected by the researchers’ faulty work.
Last month, a three-year Harvard investigation found Hauser—considered a trailblazer in the field of animal psychology—responsible for eight counts of misconduct and questioned the validity of three academic articles. Though the report recommended the retraction of one of Hauser’s articles, it made no mention of the remainder of his works.
With a federal investigation now underway, much of Hauser’s research has been called into question—and with it, the annals of literature that have grown out of it.
In response, the Psychology Department at Harvard has set in motion a project to review Hauser’s work and to determine the areas of his groundbreaking research that can be salvaged.
The task is daunting. In the last 10 years alone, Hauser has published 143 articles and four books, work that has helped form the foundation for an entirely new field of science.
“It creates a lot of uncertainty for people in those fields,” said a Harvard psychology professor who asked to remain anonymous, stating that the situation is still evolving. “They may begin to worry about whether they can trust other findings from that lab.”
INTEGRITY OF THE SCIENCE
After concluding its internal investigation, Harvard passed the case over to the federal Office of Research Integrity, which will conduct an independent investigation that could take over a year.
The dual investigations are fact-finding operations to determine if and where fault lies. But professors said for the scientific community, the reports only brush the surface of a lengthy process to cleanse the scientific record of the effects of Hauser’s “misconduct.”
“Read my lips,” Psychology Department Chair Susan E. Carey ’64 said of the task before her and the community. “This is going to unfold over years.”
The department established a committee to begin a process that could include combing through decades of research.
“We are starting a process in collaboration with the animal cognition community about how to deal with this,” Carey said. “Clearing the record is the way you deal with the integrity of the science.”
Carey said that the department has also assumed the responsibility of vindicating any department members—students and colleagues alike—who may have worked with Hauser in the past.
“They’re being damaged by guilt by association,” she said. “It’s our responsibility to figure out a process by which the field as a whole can separate the good work from the tainted work.”
According to his curriculum vitae, Hauser has advised 24 Ph.D. students and overseen 15 post doctoral students. The CV lists 221 published papers authored or co-authored by him.
And in an academic web of peer research, hundreds of published articles cite and work off of Hauser’s research.
Hauser has made a name for himself by executing novel research techniques in the field of animal cognition. His work with primates and cotton-top tamarins—the subject of Hauser’s only article to have been retracted—has involved a unique set of research skills and costly access to the animals.
“You don’t want to throw out about two decades of groundbreaking work, but you also don’t want to build a science on shaky ground,” said the psychology professor.
“How do we rescue millions of dollars of research?” the individual added.
LESSONS FROM THE PAST
As the community awaits the conclusions of the ORI investigation, the Psychology Department has turned to past precedence.
The department has circulated among its members an academic article about the case of Eric T. Poehlman, a former professor at the University of Vermont who was found responsible for research misconduct by an internal investigation in September of 2003.
The article, titled “Research Misconduct, Retraction, and Cleansing the Medical Literature: Lessons from the Poehlman Case,” recounts the process that UVM faculty members went through to identify tainted articles and inform the scientific community after Poehlman had been found responsible of misconduct.
“Our goal is to try to incrementally improve the record, to try to make it a little clearer,” said UVM Psychology Professor Russell P. Tracy, who has led the review since it began in 2005. The project is in its final phase, as members notify journals of their findings.
Instead of directly reviewing each published article, the committee asked co-authors of Poehlman’s published works to vouch for the validity of the pieces. Not all articles received a co-author’s stamp of approval, but Tracy said that the review found very few articles that could be considered fraudulent because of their reliance on the research in question.
“Secondarily fraudulent,” Tracy said.
After five years, Tracy has found little glory in his work, he said: “It’s a large arduous operation that takes faculty away from everything else that they have to do.”
But the academic article, which points to Tracy’s work as a model method, places the heavy responsibility of correcting the literature on the scientific community, demanding that it “treat every article as suspect until proven otherwise.”
“The ORI has neither the mandate nor the resources to lead the task of correcting a scientific literature polluted by fraudulent research,” the authors state. “This responsibility lies with the community of scientists.”

CORRECTION: September 21, 2010
Due to an editing error, the online headline for this Sept. 17 news article originally stated that the Psychology Department is reviewing Marc  Hauser's works. According to Chair Susan E. Carey '64, the department does not anticipate engaging in any such review. It is in the early stages of trying to reach consensus about  what the department's responsibilities are, if any, concerning efforts to evaluate Hauser's works.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A  week has passed since the University announced a surge in its  endowment, but the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has not asserted plans  for responding to Harvard’s new-found wealth after two years of rigorous  cost-cutting.
The University announced last Thursday that its endowment grew to $27.4  billion in the fiscal year ending in June 2010, an 11-percent investment  return that marked a positive turnaround in the midst of the financial  crisis.
When asked about the effects of the endowment growth on FAS finances,  spokesman Jeff Neal said that FAS Dean Michael D. Smith will update the  community about the school’s financial status at the first Faculty  meeting of the year in October.
Because FAS finalized its budget by the summer, the University’s  endowment growth will have no effect on the school for the current  academic year. But Harvard’s stronger endowment—which funds 50 percent  of the school’s budget—could provide some fiscal relief for FAS next  year.
The endowment payout—the percentage allotted for FAS expenditures—fell  12 percent for the current academic year. But the Corporation, Harvard’s  highest governing body, has yet to announce the payout for the  subsequent year. In financially calm periods, the Corporation provided  predictions to individual schools by the beginning of the spring  semester.
FAS is currently in the midst of its third and final phase of budget  reform, which involves the implementation of long-term financial changes  that will entrench smart spending habits for the future. Indeed, some  department leaders said that the discourse has steered away from  immediate cost-cutting to larger restructuring.
But FAS department leaders and staff workers described mixed signals about the status of FAS  finances, given that the administration’s conservative spending habits  contrast with the endowment’s uptick and the near-complete closure of  FAS’ deficit.
At a meeting for FAS staffers yesterday, the administration introduced  to attendees the Harvard Crimson Online Marketplace, a University tool  that aggregates departmental purchases and helps departments find more  competitive prices.
But at the very same meeting, a hint of optimism appeared when a FAS  Human Resources official presented a handbook for staff hiring—a message  that marked a stark departure from the staff hiring freeze in 2008 and  the wave of staff cuts the following year.
In the face of uncertainty surrounding the state of FAS finances,  departments have begun their annual reviews of their inventories and  their planned requests to Smith.
“We are always bold in our  requests,” said  East Asian Languages and Civilizations Chair Wilt  Idema. “We are always convinced that the requests we make are fully  justified.”
Though his department, like most throughout FAS, has felt pinched and  seen many of its requests denied, Idema said he is “looking forward to a  future in which we have a better situation.”
But some staff workers expressed frustration with the amount of funding they are receiving from Smith. The Classics Department, for example, is dealing with a section of 19 students—one more than the target section-size—in light of the enforcement of section size restrictions last year, according to an administrator who asked to remain anonymous to protect a relationship with the administration. The College, the administrator said, has been unwilling to hire an additional teaching fellow for the course.
“I think they’re being very stingy,” the staff member said of the FAS administration.
Opportunities  to hire new faculty are also slimmer than they have been during flush  years—particularly tough for a small department like Classics that has  seen several professors leave in the past two years without the funds to  replace them.
One top Humanities administrator said that the department will hold  guest lectures for the first time in over a year. But the administrator,  who requested to not be named for the same reason, described FAS’ approach as  “guarded optimism.”
“We’ve been so discouraged from thinking of that kind of thing that we  really don’t have our minds  on that at all,” the individual said.  “We’re just hoping that there won’t be more cuts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Currently, undocumented students who illegally immigrated to the United States at a young age have no means by which to obtain legal status, despite the successes they may achieve in the academic realm.
After much debate in recent years, the Senate may soon vote on legislation that would provide undocumented youth with a route to citizenship.
If passed, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act would provide qualified undocumented youth with a six-year-long conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service.
On Tuesday, U.S. Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada announced that the proposed DREAM Act will be amended to military legislation that is scheduled for vote on the Senate floor next week.
The Harvard community has been vocal in its support for the Act, which would provide amnesty for a number of its own.
STUDENT ADVOCACY
At the ground level, support for the DREAM Act has arisen from a determined Harvard student body.
Harvard College Act on a Dream, a campus organization that engages students in ensuring equality for all immigrants, collected numerous testimonies of undocumented students in a packet that was sent to U.S. senators across the nation.
The group sponsored National Coming Out of the Shadows Day last March, during which students collected around the John Harvard statue to read their stories.
“I think the Harvard community has been incredibly responsive in the last few days,” wrote Act on a Dream Co-Director Melissa V. Perez ‘13 in an e-mail. “Harvard’s Office for Federal Relations has been extremely helpful in moving things forward, as has the President’s Office. It says a lot about their commitment to protecting the rights of undocumented students across the nation. We hope more universities will follow suit.”
According to Perez, the organization prides itself in its “professional approach” to advocating for immigration reform.
“While we understand the merits of a grassroots approach to mobilizing supporters, we feel that as Harvard students we are uniquely positioned to tap into a wealth of influential resources and contacts that can be used to the movement’s advantage,” Perez wrote.
“While this is a departure from the tactics of other DREAM activists, we’re already playing an important role in changing people’s minds about next week’s vote,” she added. “The stories of our peers remind lawmakers and the public that this is not a controversial issue, but instead, a commonsense solution to an injustice. We will continue to disseminate this package far and wide.”
UNIVERSITY SPEAKS
Harvard has remained a consistent public proponent of the DREAM Act. In keeping with its support for the reforms, the University does not consider a student’s citizenship status in admissions decisions.
“The University admits qualified students from all around the globe,” said Kevin Galvin, director of news and media relations, in an interview with The Crimson in June. “We believe that the diversity of talent and experience which our students bring augments the teaching and educational experience at Harvard.”
University President Drew G. Faust has openly advocated for the DREAM Act, including writing a letter in support of the legislation to Mass. Rep. Michael E. Capuano in May 2009 and meeting with recently elected U.S. Senator Scott P. Brown in part to urge him to support the DREAM Act.
As part of a trip to Washington, D.C. this week, Faust met with Illinois Sen. Richard J. Durbin to discuss the Act and share her appreciation for his support for the proposed legislation.
“These young men and women are working hard in school and are dedicated to a future living in and contributing to our communities or serving in the military,” Faust said in a statement released yesterday. “I believe it is in our best interest to educate all students to their full potential.”
COMMUNITY SUPPORT
On Aug. 2, the Cambridge City Council passed a resolution calling upon the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to halt the removal of immigrant students.
The resolution was authored by Harvard Divinity School student Christopher C. Hope, who has also been involved at the metropolitan level with the Student Immigrant Movement, a Mass. student group that advocates for equal rights for immigrant students.
“The Student Immigration Movement has been encouraging different affiliates and people to go to Sen. Scott Brown’s office to bring the issue to the forefront,” Hope said. “My attitude is that we have work to do—we have unfinished business in protecting and helping our children receive adequate education in this country, immigrant or non immigrant.”
OPPOSING VIEWS
While some Senate Republicans have argued that Reid’s announcement is a ploy to gain Hispanic votes in the upcoming November election, other organizations, such as NumbersUSA, are confident that the advocacy will lead to an unfruitful end if the bill remains worded as is.
Roy H. Beck, president of immigration reduction group NumbersUSA, said that the DREAM Act is not written “to deal with people that they claim it’s for,” and will not solve the problem of companies hiring illegal immigrants.
“It creates a panic, wide amnesty instead of a narrow amnesty,” Beck said.
Whether or not the DREAM Act is passed, the recent discussions have brought to light the way immigration policies affect students.
“We can allow a generation of immigrant students with great potential and ambitions to contribute more fully to our society and our national security,” said Durbin in a released statement on Wednesday, “or we can relegate them to a future in the shadows, which would be a loss for us all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust lobbied lawmakers on Capitol Hill yesterday to ensure funding for human embryonic stem cell research.
In response to a federal judge’s recent decision to prohibit the government from supporting this research, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education held a hearing yesterday to consider crafting legislation to provide such funding.
Faust met with members of both the House and the Senate yesterday, including Rep. Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Sen. Mark R. Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Both congressmen hold committee positions likely to influence the outcome of federal stem cell legislation.
“Stem cell funding has been an evergreen issue since the Bush restrictions were put in place 10 years ago,” said Kevin Casey, the University’s chief lobbyist. “There has been great uncertainty in the federal funding and that has brought us to bring it up.”
During her meetings with members of Congress yesterday, Faust described Harvard’s cutting edge research as an example of what collaboration between the government and universities can accomplish.
Federal backing of stem cell research has languished after its opponents won a court case in which they successfully argued that the 1995 Dickey-Wicker Amendment prohibited the government from participating in scientific research that involved the destruction of human embryos.
Upon taking office in 2009, President Barack Obama expanded the number of stem cell lines available to researches, and the National Institutes of Health have since upped their funding, a large portion of which goes to the University.
According to Casey, Harvard researchers are responsible for 48 of the 75 federally sanctioned stem cell lines.
Yesterday’s hearing indicates that Congress could take action on the issue, a measure many Democrats think could prove politically beneficial in an election year, according to a report in The New York Times.
“We’ve come too far to give up now,” said Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat. “If we don’t win this battle in the courts, we’ll take it up in Congress. This research must continue. The politicians and activist judges who oppose it need to respect the views of the overwhelming majority of the American people, who want this research to go forward.”
Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Democrat, introduced legislation earlier this week that would codify government support for human embryonic stem cell research in federal law, a measure that would reduce the uncertainty surrounding the research.
“Young scientists rightly void fields of science for which funding may come and go due to political whim rather than scientific and medical merit,” he said in a speech on the Senate floor. “A temporary end to the current restrictions is an incomplete and ultimately self-defeating solution.”
Harkin—who chairs the subcommittee—said in yesterday’s hearing that, given the potential for medical breakthroughs, it was unconscionable for the government not to continue its support.
“No one has ever claimed that embryonic stem cells are a silver bullet. But they have special properties that no other cells can match, and that’s why they offer so much hope to people who are suffering,” he said. “That’s why so many scientists are excited to have access to these stem cell lines and to see what they can learn from them.”

Members of Harvard’s Committee on Degrees in Social Studies launched a petition yesterday “to strongly oppose” a planned celebration of former Harvard professor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz, in response to his recent blog post calling Muslim life “cheap.”
The petition also opposes the creation of a $500,000 undergraduate research fund created by Peretz’s friends and family that would sponsor thesis research and other student projects.
Within 10 hours of its online posting, the open letter already collected 93 names, as signotories lashed out against plans to honor Peretz at the committee’s 50th anniversary celebration.
Leaders in the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies plan to address the controversy at a meeting tomorrow, according to petitioners, who said they hope to convince the committee to rethink its decision at the gathering.
Simon L. Sternin ’01, one of the alumni leaders of the petition, said that the movement was in response to inaction from members in Social Studies.
“There have been a number of people who have tried to contact Social Studies in the past month or so, and we haven’t really gotten that much progress from that approach,” said Sternin, a former Social Studies concentrator. “We thought it might be more legimate to have a larger number of people in this opposition.”
The list of signatories includes many alumni and current students in the committee who are experiencing “the frustration that Social Studies is doing them all a disservice by their association,” Sternin said.
In a Sept. 4 blog post for The New Republic, Peretz stated that Muslims did not have the right to use the First Amendment and wrote, “Muslim life is cheap, especially for Muslims.” Since then, he has apologized for and retracted his post, but reaffirmed his statement on the “cheap[ness]” of Muslim life.
Members familiar with the debate conceded that a growing group of professors in the committee have voiced concerns regarding the decision to host Peretz, who has long spoken out against Arabs and Muslims, as the open letter observes.
“Peretz has a long and sordid public record of racist statements directed against various groups,” the letter states. “He has described ‘Arab society’ as ‘hidebound and backward’ and claimed (in an article later removed from The New Republic website) that ‘We have higher standards of civilization than [Arabs] do.’”
The letter states that some might recognize the fund as of unquestionable benefit to students and their research.
“There are, however, larger concerns at stake that call for a principled stand at this moment,” the letter continues. “Social Studies describes itself as a community of independent thinkers ‘who share not only a fascination with social science research and theory but also concerns about pressing social, political, and economic problems facing contemporary societies.’”
Signatory Carl G. Estabrook Jr. ’64, who called Peretz’s statements “outrageous,” said that while “Harvard might not have had the best past several years, this is an example where you have to look past the money and consider the weight of the action of taking the donation.”
Social Studies concentrator Christopher J. Carothers ’11 said that the committee’s tacit approval of Peretz’s comments worries him, given that “pseduo-intellectuals like Glenn Beck” have been promoting anti-Muslim sentiments.
“This is where Harvard has to choose between moral and money,” Carothers said. “The Harvard name has been cheapened in the past, but this is an exmaple of when we can prevent that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new podcast by the Harvard Graduate School of Education that seeks to capture the thoughts of education leaders made its debut on Harvard’s iTunes U yesterday.
“The Harvard EdCast” is a show produced by Matthew M. Weber, the new and social media officer for the School of Education. Weber says the new program aspires to be the next “Science Friday”—a popular podcast also on iTunes U—for education.
Each episode features a 15- to 20-minute discussion with a notable member of the education community.
The Harvard EdCast is “a series of conversations with thought leaders in the field of education, from across the country and around the world,” Weber, the show’s host, said in the first episode.
The guest speaker for the first installment was University President Drew G. Faust, who discussed her experience in leading a higher education community as well as her goals for a more integrated university.
A new episode will be available for download every Wednesday, and Weber said the next four have already been recorded.
Upcoming episodes will address topics such as summer reading, inner-city schools, and the benefits of a solid kindergarten education.
Michael G. Rodman, the Ed School director of communications, said the goal of EdCast is to address current issues in education, as well as talk to people making news in the field.
“Education is the building block for a just society,” Rodman said. “There are a lot of things out there that you don’t necessarily think about as education issues ... whether it is terrorism or things more obvious like the achievement gap. But all these things have a basis in education.”
Rodman, who helped launch the podcast, said he hopes that the new medium will further the Ed School’s mission to be the “nexus” for conversations about education.
“We’re serious about this,” Rodman said. “This isn’t just our talking to ourselves, but we’re talking to the world.”
Though the podcast is a pre-recorded show, audience members are highly encouraged to provide comments and interact with the education issues presented in each episode.
“It’s co-produced by everyone involved—host and listeners,” Weber said.

The Undergraduate Council announced the results of its general election last night, confirming the selection of 43 members for the 2010-2011 term. With 112 candidates competing, this year’s election was the most competitive in recent years, according to UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11.
Four House races were contested this year and the freshman yards—which are typically the most competitive—saw a nearly 70 percent increase in candidates, with 73 candidates vying for 12 positions. UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 attributed the leap in interest to the higher profile of the UC during the first weeks of school, including playing an official role in freshman convocation and sponsoring a soccer game.
“A lot of people did student council in high school,” said Jimmy P. Biblarz ’14, a newly elected Crimson Yard representative. “It’s not really that surprising at Harvard when you think about it.”
Hysen expressed disappointment, however, at the gender imbalance of the new council—only nine of the newly elected representatives are female.
The number of candidates with UC experience also increased this year, with 16 returning candidates, as opposed to 13 last year. All but one of the returning candidates were reelected to the council.
“It’s always good to have new thoughts, new ideas, new people, but at the same time it’s good to have people who know how the UC works,” said Winthrop House UC representative Chris A. Devine ’13, who served as a West Yard representative last year.
The biggest source of increased continuity in the UC, however, will be the new policy of term roll overs for executive board members. While in previous years, only the president and vice president held calendar-year terms and the committee chairs had to seek reelection each fall, for the first time, committee chairs will now hold their seats for one extra semester, instead coming up for reelection in January. According to Devine, this will allow the UC to jump into committee work more quickly over the next few weeks.
This election cycle was the first since the implementation of the UC’s election reform recommendations, which were formulated this spring in reaction to the controversy surrounding the election of Bowman and Hysen. Last November, an e-mail sent from the official presidential e-mail address alleged that Hysen may have had access to the voting software during the presidential race, leading to controversy over the validity of the election results.
The most significant changes concerned the makeup of the UC Election Commission and technological access to the voting website. For the first time, no members of the UC sat on the Commission, and no students were able to access the election results until after the election was over.
“In terms of changes we can control, in terms of setting up the function of the commission and the technology side, we’ve done all we can,” said current Finance Committee Chair Luis A. Martinez ’12, who spearheaded the election reform efforts as the head of the UC Rules Committee last semester.

The English department on Tuesday voted unanimously to begin the search for a tenure-track professor of contemporary American literature who specializes in Asian-American studies.
According to English Department Chair W. James Simpson, the University administration authorized his department to hire a new professor on June 30 after receiving a restricted donation. The gift included a provision that part of it “be used to support those whose scholarship is related to Ethnic Studies,” with the hope that “the first recipient’s research and teaching will include the field of Asian-American studies.”
Simpson said the English department plans to interview candidates this January at the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association. He added the appointment would be made shortly thereafter, and the new professor would assume the position in July 2011.
Simpson said the administration could have assigned the new tenure-track position to any number of departments. But the position will fit especially well in the English department, he said.
“If you want the experience of what it’s like to traverse cultures, then literature is the place that’s going to be the richest locus for getting deeper in that question,” Simpson said.
He also noted that the Asian-American community is one of the largest minority groups on campus and that, with the new appointment, the department might receive “an audience of people who may not have found ready footholds in the English department.”
Simpson added he does not envision a department that is divided up into “ethnically categorized subcompartments.”
“What we want instead is to address an important demographic phenomenon on this campus and in this country—we want to address it, but we don’t want to restrict it to people who come from that background,” he said.
Athena M. Lao ’12, a co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, said there is “clearly a student need” for such an alternative area of study.
This year, the English department is offering only one course related to Asian-American literature, down from two last year, according to Simpson.
Lao added she does not believe the sheer size of Harvard’s Asian-American community alone justifies the creation of the new professorship.
“We do have a large population here, which maybe makes the voices louder than they would be at another place,” she said. “But any community, if they’re vehement about their culture, has something considerable to add to what the College is offering.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a novel identification strategy, health authorities may be able to identify potential flu outbreaks earlier by tracking more vulnerable individuals, Harvard researchers say.
The study, published Wednesday by Harvard Medical School professor Nicholas A. Christakis and his research partner, James H. Fowler ’92, identified and collected reports from more sociable individuals whose frequent interactions with friends render them more vulnerable to flu breakout.
In their research, Christakis and Fowler relied on the “friendship paradox”—the social phenomenon maintaining that people generally have friends more sociable than themselves, and that people are more likely to befriend a person with many friends. During the H1N1 flu outbreak last year, Christakis and Fowler—who is a professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine—analyzed self-reported flu symptoms from two groups of people at the College.
One group comprised 319 undergraduates, and the other included 425 people the first group named as friends.
Christakis and Fowler found that the second group reported flu symptoms significantly earlier than when the flu outbreak’s peak occurred.
According to the “friendship paradox,” this group should have comprised people who are more sociable and thus more likely to catch the flu.
The study’s results show that early detection of potential flu outbreaks is possible, Christakis said, adding that vaccinations could be administered more efficiently by targeting people at the center of social networks.
The traditional method of flu prevention requires vaccinating many people, which can be time-consuming, he said.
In contrast, “if you vaccinate the very central people, you will be likely to interrupt the flow of the virus,” Christakis said, referring to people at the center of social networks as the “sentinels” of disease.
Christakis—who is also the Pforzheimer House Master—and Fowler noted in the study that their findings could be applied to other diseases that spread in social networks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Andrew Hatch left Cambridge for Baton Rouge, La., it seemed that his path and that of the Harvard football team were intrinsically separate, and that neither would be the worse for it. The Crimson was set at quarterback with Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09, and Hatch was off to Tiger Stadium to compete for playing time at LSU, one of the top football programs in the country.
But Hatch and the Crimson were ultimately inseparable, and now neither can function on the gridiron without the other.
Harvard offers Hatch one last chance to lead an offense, and the Crimson’s season may rest in the hands of the field general who has travelled to the deep south and back looking for an army.
“He’s going to get the job done,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says.
Back in the fall of 2005, before his story became nationally known, Hatch was a junior varsity quarterback who reminded his coaches of a certain Buffalo Bills signal caller.
“What’s better than athletic and fast?” Murphy asks. “Big, athletic, and fast. He’s more like Ryan Fitzpatrick [’05] in terms of his skill set.”
But that athleticism wasn’t enough to earn Hatch varsity playing time in his first year. With Harvard in good hands, Hatch decided to put his college football career on hold and serve the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by going on a two-year mission.
“I decided after my first year that I was going to go serve a mission for my church, which is something a lot of the guys my age, around 19 or 20, usually do,” he explains. “People in my family had done it, and I thought it seemed like a good thing for me to carry on. So I left to do that—I ended up going to the southern part of Chile for a while.”
But Hatch’s mission in Chile was cut short by a torn meniscus sustained while playing soccer, and he was forced to fly back to the US for surgery.
But even with a wounded knee, Hatch held the attention of Gary Crowton. As the head coach of Brigham Young University, Crowton had tried to recruit Hatch out of high school to come play for the Cougars.
At his new post as LSU’s offensive coordinator, he was finally able to lure Hatch away from the Crimson with the offer of a football scholarship. The opportunity was too good to pass up. Hatch figured that Harvard had enough talent at quarterback that it wouldn’t miss him too much.
But not even the Tigers could take the Crimson out of Hatch.
After two seasons with LSU, during which he suffered a concussion and broke his fibula in his left leg, the Nevada native decided to head back north, remembering the love of the school that first led him to Cambridge.
“I was recruited by Harvard out of high school,” Hatch recalls. “I pretty much knew it was the top academic environment you could find...I liked Harvard all along; it felt like the right place after I visited.”
“Deep down, I think I always knew I wanted to finish at Harvard,” he adds.
But before he had a chance to compete for the Crimson starting job, Hatch had to sit out a year, as per NCAA rules.
“Not having a chance to play and compete for a spot is tough, but I tried to keep it positive,” Hatch says. “It’s a really good group of guys, and I really enjoy being a part of that. And more than that, I ran the scout offense [last] fall, which is basically what younger guys do when they come into the program and might not be starting right away. I really felt like that was my opportunity to compete against our defense. It definitely made me better.”
Even entering the 2010 season, it was unclear that Hatch would ever have an offense to call his own, as incumbent senior Collier Winters—an All-Ivy pick in 2009—was favored to keep his spot.
Throughout preseason, Hatch and Winters stayed nose to nose in competition before an injury to Winters took the decision out of Murphy’s hands.
Finally under center for the Crimson, Hatch seems a perfect fit for the Harvard offense.
“Hatch has a really strong arm,” senior receiver Marco Iannuzzi says. “He can scramble one way and throw it right across the field. It’s rare to see a guy throw it across his body.”
Hatch’s deep ball will clear up room near the line of scrimmage for the Crimson’s running back trio of senior Gino Gordon and sophomores Treavor Scales and Rich Zajeski.
“[Hatch] will give us the opportunity to run the kind of offense we want to run,” Murphy says.
Athleticism, of course, can only take a quarterback and his team so far. The best quarterbacks are also known for their intelligence, work ethic, and maturity.
Luckily for Harvard, Murphy and Iannuzzi say Hatch possesses all three.
“He’s a very bright kid, and that carries over to football—and that’s not a given,” Murphy says. “He’s a very hard worker in terms of ‘Coach, what do I need to do to improve? Can I come look at more film? Can we find extra meeting time?’”
“He’s definitely a very mature player,” Iannuzzi adds. “He’s very focused. You don’t see him doing anything wrong off the field. He’s a 100-percent focused guy, a really good person. That carries on the field to him being a real leader. If players want to ground themselves, they can go talk to Hatch.”
As another player who has taken a long route to the Crimson, Iannuzzi knows the benefits of a long road to Cambridge.
“It makes him and makes myself realize how special this time is,” he says.
“I’m really excited to be out there and just play,” Hatch concurs.
Five years and two continents later, the quarterback has finally found his field: the one he wanted all along.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At its most fundamental level, the job of any defense is relatively simple: give the ball back to its offensive counterpart.
For the Harvard defense, the increasing complexity of offenses in the Ivy League has made its job considerably more difficult in attaining that goal. There are, after all, more schemes to learn—particularly those incorporating the spread offense—and more reads to make.
But the Crimson still feels it can dominate on the gridiron.
In fact, even with the graduation of several major contributors—including linebacker Jon Takamura ’10, cornerback Derrick Barker ’10, and safety Ryan Barnes ’10—the Harvard coaching staff expects this year’s defense to be even better.
“We’re really excited about our defense,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy says. “We have an expression: it’s what’s up front that counts. And our front seven has the chance to be one of the better front sevens we’ve had in a while here.”
Senior defensive tackles Chuks Obi and Josue Ortiz—both All-Ivy selections a season ago—return to form the Ivy League’s most formidable interior line.
“They’re both physical, athletic, and disruptive,” Murphy says. “And it’s tough—we struggle to block them in practice.”
Together with senior Ryan Burkhead and junior Ben Graeff—two defensive ends who missed all of last season due to injury—both Obi and Ortiz will strive to make Ivy offenses one-dimensional by controlling the line of scrimmage and stopping the run.
“What we want to be known for [as a defense] is stopping the run,” says senior middle linebacker Nick Hasselberg. “We want to concentrate [on] being physical at the point of attack. We essentially want teams to have to throw the football, because they won’t be able to run on us.”
As the only returning starter, Hasselberg will lead a linebacking corps that is the least experienced unit of the Harvard defense. Juniors Blaise Deal and Alex Gedeon will man the strong-side and weak-side linebacker positions, respectively.
And though the unit may have lost veteran leadership, the coaches believe that it will get a major upgrade in speed.
“There’s some good players that have graduated from the program,” says defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99. “But what we have now is three tremendous athletes, upper level of the league in terms of athletic ability. We feel good about the athleticism, but a lot of stuff is going to be new for them.”
Though last season the Crimson employed multiple defensive formations that often incorporated the Raider position—a hybrid capable of playing both the safety and linebacker positions—Harvard will return to its base 4-3 package this season while breaking in two new starters.
“With [Gedeon], I’ve never seen a linebacker pick up the scheme as quickly as he does,” Hasselberg says. “To run our classic 4-3 defense in a time when more and more offenses are running the spread, linebackers have to really know their coverage and become even quicker.”
“We’re 4-3, but our outside linebacker has to be a guy who’s a slot defender that can play in space and can also have great inside linebacker technique,” Larkee says. “There’s a lot of schematics, but at the end of it, it’s all about putting the best 11 players on the field.”
Protecting the deep ball and leading an experienced group of athletes in the secondary will be preseason All-American captain Collin Zych, a do-it-all safety who led the Crimson with 73 tackles last season.
“Our goal as a secondary is to be the best defensive backfield in the Ivy League, which we feel we can do,” Zych says.
While Zych may be the face of the Harvard defense, several new defensive backs will look to make an impact as starters this season. Sophomore DJ Monroe and junior Dan Minamide both had impressive preseasons and will look to replace Barker and Barnes.
“[Minamide] is really the guy who’s probably the most improved guy in the [secondary],” Murphy says. “He’s very athletic [and] had never played defense until he came to Harvard, and now that he’s in his third year, he’s really adapted.”
Junior corner Matt Hanson—the Ivy League Rookie of the Year in 2008—also returns after registering 31 total tackles and seven pass breakups last season.
“We’ve put a lot of speed and athleticism on the field,” Murphy says. “We think that these four guys are All-Ivy caliber players.”
Despite having blue-chip talent across the board, both Murphy and Larkee have devoted most of the preseason to developing depth—a must-have they believe to be crucial to the Crimson’s success on the defensive end of the ball this season.
“Developing our depth, developing our backups, from my standpoint, is one of the most important things you can do,” Larkee says. “You lose certain guys every year, and we need a lot more [from the players] than they can go, from a depth, substitution, and injury perspective.”
As the season opener against Holy Cross looms, the pieces appear to be in place for a stifling Harvard defense.
“Our defense certainly has been way ahead of our offense in the offseason,” Murphy says.
With the defense looking to be as strong as ever in Murphy’s tenure, an Ivy championship certainly appears to be in the works for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Collin Zych knows, sometimes something as inconspicuous as a simple letter can change one’s life.
Coming out of high school, the safety was often overlooked as a recruit. A solid career at Plano East High School in Texas led to some interest from Division I-AA schools, and Zych decided that if he was going to play I-AA football, he wanted to play in the Ivy League.
He was strongly pursued by Dartmouth and Columbia, but with excellent grades, Zych had his eyes set on attending Harvard.
“I wasn’t the best recruit,” Zych says. “I wasn’t very proactive about sending highlight tapes and talking to coaches. I think that initially turned [the Crimson] off from me.”
Unwilling to let the opportunity to attend Harvard pass by without at least making an effort, Zych took matters into his own hands. He wrote a letter to head coach Tim Murphy and sent a highlight tape, and from there the interest from the Crimson’s side started to pick up. The team decided to take a chance on the safety.
Fast-forward four years. The awards Zych grew accustomed to in high school haven’t stopped coming. He has been named to the Division I-AA preseason All-America team by Consensus Draft Services, Phil Steele’s College Football Preview, and the FCS Subdivision Senior Scout Bowl selection committee, and was tabbed the Ivy League Preseason Defensive Player of the Year by Lindy’s, The Sports Network, and College Sporting News.
Looking back on where he came from, Zych is humbled by the recognition he has been receiving, but the senior is able to put it in perspective.
“Obviously it’s a great honor to have all of those preseason awards and recognition—to me it’s just a symbol of all the hard work I’ve put in,” he says. “But at the end of the day, it’s all speculation...You don’t want to get too wrapped up in that.”
What happened in between that turned an overlooked recruit from Texas into an Ivy League star?
Zych grew, both as a player and a person.
When the safety arrived at Harvard, he was given a duplicate number, meaning the coaching staff didn’t expect him to play very much. He was going up against guys the Crimson had taken the initiative to pursue and thus were higher on the depth chart.
“Seeing other guys that might’ve been better recruits than me or they were expecting better things from definitely did motivate me,” Zych says. “I just wanted to prove them wrong.”
To do so, Zych got to work. As he labored, the coaching staff that had previously ignored him began to take notice. After not appearing in a game as a freshman, he had earned the starting job at safety by his sophomore year and was named to the All-Ivy Second Team after leading the Crimson in solo tackles.
As a junior, Zych was named first-team All-Ivy by the league’s coaches after finishing first in the conference in pass breakups (12) and passes defended (14) and leading his team in tackles (73) and solo tackles (53). All of a sudden, Collin Zych had made a name for himself.
“I think he’s grown as a player in that every year I think he just feels more confident in his knowledge of his position, how we play as a defense, how everything integrates and coordinates,” Murphy says. “Confidence is critical...He’s a very dependable player.”
“It’s all about preparation,” Zych adds. “Knowing your opponent, knowing what to expect, and just being in the right spot and making plays when you’re there has allowed me to be one of the most consistent players on our defense and for other people to notice.”
It wasn’t just others around the league who sensed Zych’s work ethic and drive. His teammates had taken notice too, and in return, they voted their safety the team’s captain for the 2010 season.
Though Zych knows the responsibility that comes with the distinction, he’s also humbled to have been given such an honor.
“It kind of symbolizes the respect all your teammates and coaches have for you,” he says. “Instead of worrying about yourself, you’re worrying about 110 other guys. So it’s a different kind of role, but it’s a role I enjoy very much.”
Remembering the way a single letter had changed everything for him, Zych decided to write another letter—this time not to Coach Murphy but to his teammates before they returned to school. He made sure to make it personal—not sent via e-mail or Facebook, but by snail mail—and went to lengths to print  it on the Harvard letterhead.
“The main message of the letter was that in order to achieve the goals that we have—to go undefeated and win the Ivy League—we all have to be all-in,” Zych says. “Through preparation, training, and just overall mentality, we want to make sure that we have the confidence when we step on the field to know that we are going to beat whoever we are lining up against.”
The reaction to the letter was universally positive.
“I had some teammates come up to me and say they thought it was a good letter,” Zych says. “A lot of people said they got pumped up by it...That was the goal, to get people excited, get people on board. I think it accomplished that.”
Zych has won over the trust and confidence not only of his teammates, but also of the coaching staff that initially was hesitant to recruit him.
“He’s just one of those kids that, regardless of the situation, is extremely poised, confident, and dependable, and both physically and mentally tough,” Murphy says. “It’s definitely his intangibles that really set him apart and really generate the type of respect that is going to allow [him] to be a captain of the Harvard football team. He’s special.”
His coach has called Zych the best safety he’s had in his 17 years coaching the Crimson. But through the entire journey from unknown to stardom, Zych hasn’t changed at all.
“My main focus for this year is just to be a great leader for this team and play as well as I can on game day,” he says. “That’s always been my approach—that’s not going to change because of some recognition.”
In either case, because of a single letter, Collin Zych has finally been recognized.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When meeting Harvard on the gridiron last year, Ivy League defenses didn’t have much room for error on the ground. If it wasn’t a shifty tailback eluding tackles, it was a powerful one cutting right through the defense.
The tandem of senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales tore up the Ivy League last season, spearheading the conference’s best rushing offense to an average 178.7 yards per game.
And this season, they’re back for more.
“I can see it in Treavor, that we both have a very competitive drive,” Gordon says. “The moment we got here, we expected to have some type of playing time and compete and do whatever we can to help the team.”
Both Gordon, who hails from southern California, and Scales, who lives outside Atlanta, switched to football from basketball at an early age and were hooked.
“I was running down the [basketball] court, and this kid was in the lane,” Scales recalls of his nine-year-old self. “I went for a layup, and the kid didn’t move, so I went right through him to the goal. From the stands, his mother yelled at me, ‘This is basketball, not football!’ And I went home that day and told my mom I wanted to play football.”
That penchant for running through the opposition hasn’t lessened for Scales, who came to Harvard after a standout career at Dunwoody High School. A two-time captain of his high school team, Scales racked up 23 touchdowns in his senior season on his way to becoming just the third 1,000-yard rusher in Dunwoody history.
“Before I came up here, the coaches back home in Atlanta for me, they were the ones constantly pushing me and saying, ‘You know, you can go up there, you can make an impact as soon as you step on campus,’” he says. “That’s just a mindset you have to have.”
Scales gained an average of 53.9 yards per game while scoring five touchdowns in his first season in Cambridge—numbers good enough to earn him Ivy Rookie of the Year honors. His best individual performance came in a 42-21 win over Dartmouth, when he ran for 120 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
“I take a couple of pages out of his playbook every once in a while, as far as his jump cuts,” Gordon says of his teammate. “He’s a very explosive player, and a lot of times I try to emulate my running style a little bit to him.”
With a season of experience already under Scales’ belt, Crimson coach Tim Murphy is expecting an even better season out of his young tailback.
“There’s a certain degree of confidence that you develop when you’ve had a successful freshman year at this level,” he says. “You’re a better player if you can be a confident player. Beyond that, he knows the system. He should be a more effective player just by virtue of understanding the system, being farther along, hopefully being just a little physically better as a sophomore.”
But while Scales is a rising star, he still won’t be the headliner for Harvard. That honor belongs to Gordon, who was a first-team All-Ivy selection a year ago. The senior proved to be a triple threat for the Crimson, acting as the team’s leading rusher (averaging 70.2 yards per game with eight touchdowns), second-leading receiver (23 total receptions), and a key blocker when the ball wasn’t in his hands.
“The thing about Gino is he’s such a complete player,” Murphy says. “But beyond that, he’s a real leader. He’s a guy that has such a great work ethic, he’s a guy that’s such an intense, tough kid. He’s a guy who is not afraid to hold his teammates accountable, and people really respect him for that—coaches and players.”
For the second year in a row, Gordon played a crucial role in securing a win in The Game. As a sophomore, the Californian had a career-high 168 yards in a 10-0 victory over Yale, scoring the only touchdown of the game on a freezing, windy afternoon that he calls one of his favorite in a Harvard uniform.
Last year, it was a spin move to escape a tackle on a 4th-and-four play in the fourth quarter that proved the catalyst for the Crimson’s 14-10 comeback win.
In his senior season, Gordon’s expected to continue to spark the offense on the field. But more lasting will be the contribution he’s made to the development of Scales and the squad’s third running back, sophomore Rich Zajeski.
“I see him as what pushes me to get better every day,” Scales says of his mentor. “His patience as a runner, his confidence as a runner, his ability to see the game for what all is going on—his vision on the field is second to none. And so that’s what I pursue and I try to be every day.”
For Gordon’s part, facing competition has driven the already-accomplished athlete to take steps to improve his game.
“When you have these young guys kind of clipping at your heels every time, it really pushes you to keep trying, not just to stay static and stay the same player as I’ve been since freshman year,” he says.
But though Scales and Zajeski, who made an impression on Murphy in preseason and will fill the spot in the tailback rotation left by the graduation of Cheng Ho ’10, may be learning from Gordon on the field, that doesn’t mean their relationship is all business.
“I mess with him all the time,” Scales admits with a grin. “We call him G-Pops, we call him Grandpa, because he’s so much older than me. So he gives us heck for that all the time.”
Joking aside, the elder statesman gets as much out of the relationship as his protégé.
“We’re all brothers on this team, we’re all very close, but to have someone like Treavor who’s at my position, who has the same mindset, has the same goals, same type of competitive drive—it’s really nice,” Gordon says. “I hope that he’s able to learn from everything that I do and take it a step further.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone is questioning the Harvard football team’s offensive line this year. That’s just fine with them—it’s another opportunity to surprise unsuspecting opponents.
With the loss of four starters, including NFL tackle James Williams ’10, it is easy to predict the challenges facing the new group.
“I think our biggest concern probably is the offensive line,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy says. “One, we graduated four seniors last year, four really good players. And two, we’ve been banged up during the preseason...and we haven’t really had the opportunity to really get used to one concrete group.”
But ask any of the athletes in the trenches, and they have a bit more confidence to go with the chip on their shoulders.
“Even though we graduated four guys, we have four seniors on the offensive line, so I don’t foresee too many changes,” senior guard Brent Osborne says.
Harvard does still have its stalwarts along the line, with Osborne leading the way. The right guard started all but one contest in 2009 and will be a role model to the rest of the linemen—even if they are his classmates.
“[Osborne] takes pride in leading by example, and he’s great at that because he’s one of the best and most physical linemen—not just on our team, but in the league,” Murphy says.
But Osborne deflects the individual praise, emphasizing instead that the group must gel as a unit to succeed.
“The same as every year, [I try to] play as hard as I can, try to be a good team player,” Osborne says. “On the offensive line, you don’t really have one guy that can dominate. You have to have all five guys playing at the same level.”
Yet if there’s one position that needs to be dominant, it is on the other side of the line at left tackle. Williams proved adept last year at protecting then-junior Collier Winters’ blind side, helping the first-year starter settle in at quarterback. Once again, the Crimson must break in a new starter this year, as senior Andrew Hatch will take the reins under center. Hatch, even more of a pocket passer than Winters, will not fare well if constant pressure disrupts his rhythm. An entirely overhauled offensive line might not inspire confidence, but junior Kevin Murphy is no average replacement.
The 6’7” left tackle has emerged as a rising star along the line, morphing what was once a 240-lb. frame into a 290-lb. fortress, according to his coach.
“I think one of the surprises of the league will be our left tackle,” said Tim Murphy at the Ivy League Media Day in August. “[Kevin Murphy’s] got great size, he’s very athletic, very tough, and very committed. We think he has a chance to be as good an O-lineman as we’ve had since Matt Birk [’98].”
The coach’s comment came well before the start of the season, but comparing Kevin Murphy to an All-Pro NFL center certainly caught the media’s attention. And if anyone was concerned that Coach Murphy was indulging in hyperbole, the man who has led Harvard football for 17 years only became more confident after the preseason.
“[Kevin] is not just tall and big and athletic,” Coach Murphy praises. “He’s smart, he’s tough, and...like I said, he probably has the most potential of any lineman we’ve had here...So we expect big things from Murph.”
The left tackle has taken such high expectations in stride, but the first-year starter realizes that until he proves his talent in games, all the hype is just speculation.
“This season I definitely have to prove myself as a player,” Kevin says.
But even in the position that Michael Lewis glorified in The Blind Side, Kevin recognizes that, like Osborne, his talent only represents one piece of the puzzle.
“It’s not so much making myself better as it is forming a cohesive group with the other linemen that I’m working with,” Kevin says of his offseason focus. “[I’m] trying my hardest and making sure everyone else tries their hardest.”
The only question, then, is who everyone else will be. Osborne and Murphy could represent enough All-Ivy talent to be the foundation of a solid line, but injuries and inconsistency have left the rest of the group in flux.
Coach Murphy credited senior center Chris Leroy, who will also fill All-Ivy shoes with the departure of Alex Spisak ’10, as the last true fixture among the front five. Seniors Matt Bush and Kyle Harasimowicz currently have the edge to fill out the left guard and right tackle spots, respectively, but as the squad prepares for Holy Cross tomorrow, the final two starters must prove that they can keep pace. If so, the offensive line that has generated so many question marks may leave a few defenses questioning themselves.
“[The linemen] are one of the hardest-working groups on the team, and you see that every day,” says senior running back Gino Gordon. “So I have the utmost confidence in what they’re doing. We’re going to have a lot of fun this year playing behind them...I don’t think our run game will skip a beat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After coming up short last year, the Harvard football team is ready to return to the top of the Ivy League.
Brown and Penn have frustrated the Crimson in the last two seasons, respectively. The Bears forced a tie for the crown in 2008, and the Quakers took it outright after a 17-7 win in Cambridge late in the 2009 season.
But according to preseason polls and the Harvard players and coaches, 2010 will again be the year of the Crimson.
The season will open with a bang, as Harvard matches up with Holy Cross, which handed the Crimson its first loss last year.
Although the Ivy League title is the ultimate goal, Harvard has its focus on its upcoming rematch and the chance for redemption.
“Right now, we’re looking at Holy Cross,” says senior running back Gino Gordon, “because we lost to them last year, and we flat out don’t like losing two years in a row.”
“As soon as you step into the locker room, there’s a sign up that says, ‘Beat Holy Cross,’” sophomore teammate Treavor Scales adds, “and there’s no other sign up. You don’t see any other team up.”
The Crusaders are coming off a 31-7 loss to the University of Massachusetts last weekend, the squad’s first defeat following the graduation of standout quarterback Dominic Randolph last spring.
After the game against Holy Cross, the Crimson will open its conference schedule in Rhode Island.
Brown finished the 2009 season third in the Ivy League, just behind Harvard, and boasts four returning All-Ivy players on the roster. The squads will face off in the first night game in Brown history.
Then, once more, the Crimson will venture into the Patriot League to challenge Lafayette, which, like Holy Cross, defeated Harvard last season, 35-18.
“It was the first time [Lafayette] beat us in nine years,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy says, “and I realized at the time how big an accomplishment that was, because they were always that tough. We thought every year we were very fortunate to beat them. So teams like Lafayette and Holy Cross are very good in terms of our non-league schedule.”
The Crimson will follow with another Ivy matchup against Cornell at Harvard Stadium before hosting Lehigh University, which it beat, 28-14, in 2009.
After the game against Lehigh, Harvard will close its season with a string of five conference games.
The Crimson will enjoy three of the easier contests on its slate when it travels to face Princeton and Dartmouth before returning home for its matchup against Columbia.
But just like the opening of its season, Harvard will finish its schedule with a bang: the rematch against the 2009 Ivy League champion, Penn, on Nov. 13, and of course, The Game against Yale.
In its win over the Crimson last year, the Quakers were in control of the game from the opening drive and held a commanding 17-0 lead at halftime.
Harvard was able to get on the scoreboard in the third quarter, but the effort was not enough to capture the Ivy League title.
Notably, Penn led the nation in scoring defense and had the strongest defensive line in the Ivy League in 2009.
From a title rematch to its most celebrated rivalry, the Crimson will cap off conference play and the season in traditional fashion with the 127th playing of The Game, held in Cambridge.
Harvard won the matchup last year after a fourth-quarter comeback and is currently on a three-year winning streak. But the Bulldogs lead the all-time rivalry with 65 victories to the Crimson’s 53.
The road to the title and an undefeated season will not be an easy one, as Harvard faces difficult opponents both within and outside its conference.
“I don’t see any team in the [Ivy] League getting weaker,” Murphy says. “They’re all going to be challenging.”
Aside from its tough schedule, the Crimson has to deal with struggles within the team, such as graduating four players from its offensive line and losing its starting quarterback, senior Collier Winters, to a preseason injury.
But with senior LSU transfer quarterback Andrew Hatch, returning running backs Gordon and Scales, and returning safety and captain Collin Zych, Harvard has a chance to overcome its personnel obstacles and contend for the title that eluded it last year.
“All of us are very competitive—we want to get the season started and just get going,” Gordon says. “We feel like we have a lot to prove—we didn’t win the championship last year. Every year that we don’t win a championship, it’s just not good enough.”
Beginning with Holy Cross, the run for another Ivy championship and an undefeated season begins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping its last two matches, the Harvard women’s soccer team looked for a win against Boston University (4-5-0) yesterday afternoon.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the third time was not the charm, as it was defeated, 3-0, by the visiting Terriers.
Despite several solid goal attempts, Harvard was shut out by the combined goalkeeping powers of freshman Kelly King and junior Alice Binns.
The Crimson opened the game with a promising start: firing off a shot just 12 seconds after the initial whistle.
Other close goal attempts were made by captain Katherine Sheeleigh, junior Melanie Baskind, and sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro inside the box, but each chance was spoiled by King.
BU forcefully responded in the 20th minute, as junior Jessica Luscinski took advantage of a pass from teammate Shauna Kelleher and slipped one past Crimson goalie Jessica Wright.
Wright, a freshman, recorded seven saves on the game and her first collegiate start.
“We started out doing some good things,” coach Ray Leone said. “It just wasn’t going in for us.”
The loss comes off the heels of a tough weekend for Harvard, which fell to Central and South Florida, 3-0 and 2-1, respectively.
With a 1-3-1 record as conference play approaches, the Crimson is looking for a change in momentum.
“It’s frustrating,” Baskind said. “It’s becoming a bit of a habit for us to start out weaker and improve as the season goes on.”
During the 2009 season, Harvard had been on a four-game losing streak, including a 1-0 loss at Boston University, before exploding onto the Ivy League scene with six straight wins and eventually, an Ivy League title.
Still, it doesn’t make the loss yesterday any easier.
Although Harvard stayed even with the Terriers on corner kicks, both earning six, BU had a 22-16 shot advantage over the Crimson.
In addition to the opening goal by Luscinski, the Terriers were able to put two more shots in the back of the net.
To give BU a dominant 2-0 lead in the beginning of the second half, Lisa Kevorkian scored off a shot from the right side of the field, placing the ball into the left corner of the post.
“Goals always change the game,” Leone said. “Especially when we were down two early in the second half.”
Brittany Heist struck the final blow against Harvard with less than 10 minutes to play.
The junior took advantage of a corner kick placed into the box by Kylie Strom, heading the ball just beyond the reach of Wright.
Earlier in the second half, Wright made an impressive save on another corner kick, tipping the shot just over the upper post.
Like in the first half, Harvard had a number of close attempts in the second.
With just under 25 minutes left in the game, Sheeleigh nearly put the Crimson on the scoreboard, only to be stopped by Binns.
Freshman Elizabeth Weisman also had a scoring opportunity in the waning minutes of the game. Weisman was able to beat the goalie on a breakaway, but a Terrier defender squandered her shot attempt.
“The score didn’t represent the way our team played in this game,” Baskind said. “In the last few games we just haven’t been able to finish.”
Baskind and Sheeleigh led the Harvard offense, each recording four shots on goal.
Despite the loss, the Crimson remains confident in its ability to perform, and succeed, in the upcoming Ivy season.
“We’re not ready yet [for Ivy League competition],” Leone said. “But we will be. [The team] can dig down, they can do it.”
Harvard has one more non-conference contest against Rhode Island at home this weekend before opening Ivy League play against Penn next week.
The team may be off to a rough beginning to the season, but after winning back-to-back Ivy League titles in 2008 and 2009, don’t count the Crimson out yet.
For Leone, it’s less about titles and individual wins than it is about effort.
“I want them to improve every day and give what they’ve got,” Leone said. “If they give everything they have, I’ll be happy.”
Yesterday’s loss could end up being the Crimson’s gain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in three years, the No. 6 Harvard men’s soccer team is heading west, but to get back there, the team’s senior class has had to go full circle.
The Crimson will participate in the Lobo Classic in Albuquerque, N.M., this weekend, where it will face UC Santa Barbara tonight and New Mexico Sunday afternoon on the Lobos’ home turf.
It will be the first time since 2007 that Harvard plays at a school not located on the East Coast. Its most recent game out west came against the Gauchos as well and ended in a 1-1 tie.
Harvard had also entered that match ranked No. 6 in the country. Current seniors Robert Millock, Alex Chi, and Jaren LaGreca all saw action as freshmen.
“Last time we played them they were coming off a national championship,” Millock–now a co-captain with LaGreca–remembers. “For Chi, Jaren, and myself, it was our first time playing a top-10 team in college. I just remember it was a very good game; they were an all-around good team.”
While the Crimson (2-0-1) has gotten off to a strong start so far this season–moving up four spots from its preseason ranking with a win over then-No. 13 Stanford and a tie against No. 8 Connecticut–the Gauchos (0-2-2) have moved in the opposite direction.
After entering the year ranked two spots above Harvard at No. 8 in the country, Santa Barbara has gone its first four games without a win, losing to Cal State Bakersfield and No. 16 Creighton, while tying New Mexico and Davidson.
The Gauchos’ major struggles have been offensive, due to the loss of former leading scorer David Walker to graduation. The team only has scored three goals the entire year, led by sophomore forward Sam Garza’s two. Junior forward Danny Barrera–the team’s assist leader last year, also  third on the team with five goals–has taken 11 shots this year but has yet to score.
Harvard will be looking to increase its own pressure on Santa Barbara senior goalie Sam Hayden, whose 1.11 goals against average is up from his 2009 average of 0.74.
The Crimson has never before faced the Lobos (3-1-1), but Harvard coach Carl Junot coached New Mexico for six years and was the assistant director of the Lobo Soccer Academy before joining the Crimson.
“Potentially I know the type of soccer the Lobos like to play, and from just coaching here at New Mexico I’ve been able to see the Santa Barbara team play several times,” Junot said. “I feel as a coach I’m very comfortable with the playing style.”
Junot said that facing his former team doesn’t provide him with any extra motivation to win.
“My energy and motivation is based on the fact that we’re in the midst of a very good season with our Harvard team,” he said. “That’s our primary motivation; it doesn’t have as much to do with our opponents.”
New Mexico has been better offensively than the Gauchos, scoring 10 goals in its five games this season, with its only loss coming against No. 15 Portland.
The Lobo offense is paced by junior midfielder Lance Rozeboom and sophomore forward Levi Rossi, both of whom have two goals on the year. They and their teammates will be looking to keep the pressure up on Harvard goalkeeper Austin Harms, who has gotten off to a good start against tough competition early in the season.
“Three of the four goals we’ve given up have been off of set pieces,” Junot said. “We’ve asked Austin to continue improving his organizing of the defense, limiting the number of free kicks we give up, and to focus on his positioning and his individual efforts when other teams get free kick opportunities.”
In net for the Lobos will be sophomore Justin Holmes, who sports just a .455 save percentage on the year.
The Crimson attack is led by sophomore forward Brian Rogers, who has a team-leading two goals on the season. All of Harvard’s scoring on the season, in fact, has come from underclassmen. Sophomores Scott Prozeller and Zack Wolfenzon and freshman Ross Friedman have all scored one goal for the Crimson thus far.
In terms of shot differential, both Santa Barbara (56-39) and New Mexico (65-25) have led opponents by a wide margin this season. Harvard, in contrast, has been outshot 47-38 by its opponents.
Coming off a tie against the Huskies in which it was outshot 25-6, and facing a pair of teams which like to attack, the Crimson defense will need to be at the top of its game.
“If you’re allowing shots, it’s not an issue; it only becomes an issue when you’re allowing good scoring chances,” Millock said. “I think we’ve done a good job limiting opponents chances [this season].”
Despite the fact that neither UC Santa Barbara nor New Mexico is nationally ranked (both received two points in the most recent NSCAA poll), Harvard knows it can’t take either squad lightly. Like the Crimson, both schools reached the NCAA Tournament in 2009, with the Gauchos losing in the Sweet 16 and the Lobos falling in the opening round.
“[Underestimation] shouldn’t be an issue,” Millock said. “I think we all understand that any team can beat any other team on any given day. We’re just trying to focus and concentrate on ourselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding high off a narrow 9-8 win over George Washington in the final game of the otherwise bleak Princeton Invitational, Harvard men’s water polo anticipates boosting its 2-4 record and proving it can adjust to a new coach and new set of players this weekend, when it hosts the 2010 Eastern College Athletic Conference men’s water polo championship at Blodgett Pool.
“We’re still in the feeling-out phase of our schedule,” coach Ted Minnis said. “We’re going to keep doing what we do. The guys need to get comfortable getting used to…the lessons we are learning.”
Despite the 1-3 record at last weekend’s tournament, both Minnis and his players claim the losses signaled areas for improvement this past week in practice.
“With our smaller roster, our first six games have been learning to adjust to a smaller 10-person rotation,” co-captain Brent Voith said. “Now that we have that under our belt, we need to maximize our energy and minutes in the pool.”
The Crimson, seeded 10th, will face off against seventh-seed MIT (1-1) today at 4:30 p.m. in the first of at least three matches for the weekend.
“We watched them play a couple weeks ago,” Minnis said. “MIT is very good. They have great speed in transition. We want to minimize turnovers and shut down their counterattacks.”
According to senior Alex Thompson, Harvard especially wants to beat MIT today because the Engineers have cast the Crimson out of the first round of playoffs for the past two years.
“Last year, we were pretty disappointed in ourselves when we were eliminated in the playoffs by them,” Thompson said. “You try to forget the game, but you also need to keep it as a motivator.”
Harvard will have to look out for MIT standouts Craig Cheney and Columbus Leonard, who were honored by the Collegiate Water Polo Association last week as Northern Division Rookie of the Week and Divisional Defensive Player of the Week, respectively.
If the Crimson loses to the Engineers, it will play the loser of the game between sixth-seeded Fordham (4-5) and eleventh-seeded Mercyhurst (2-2), who have also both defeated George Washington at the Navy Invitational earlier this season.
But if they win this afternoon, the men will take on second seed Princeton (3-1) tomorrow for the second time this week.
Harvard lost 14-9 to the Tigers on Sept. 11, despite holding a 6-5 lead at half-time.
Sophomore Tim Wenzlau led Princeton in last weekend’s win over the Crimson with five goals and will likely be a major threat to Harvard again this weekend should the teams rematch.
Princeton returns to the ECAC Championship as last year’s runner-up, behind Navy, which is not entered in the 2010 tournament.
No matter the opponent, Minnis and Voith agree that the team will not base its strategies on a specific opposing offense or defense.
“We haven’t paid a lot of attention to the other teams yet,” Minnis said. “We will let the other teams adjust to us.”
According to Voith, the Crimson will instead continue to improve upon its work from earlier in the season.
“We’re not changing anything for this tournament, but we’ll [continue to] run our new offense; we’re running our drives and picks in a different scheme,” Voith said. “And this [past] week in practice, we tightened up the intricacies of it. With any sort of system it takes time and effort and practice for everyone to be at the same pace.”
The Harvard-hosted tournament will run through Sunday and feature twelve teams, led by first-seed Bucknell (6-2).
The Crimson’s best showing in the ECAC championship was fourth place in 2002. But Voith hopes the home-pool advantage will factor favorably into his squad’s finish this year.
“When the home-game crowd comes out, they usually bring a good atmosphere,” Voith said.
As for Minnis, he wants to beat more than just Harvard’s opponents—he wants to beat expectations.
“Whenever you come into a tournament that is a seeded tournament, you want to do better than they seeded you,” Minnis said. “We came in seeded tenth, and we want to break the top nine. The season is a staircase, and we want to keep climbing it and going up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a weekend with no home games to speak of, Harvard athletics boast four home games this weekend, which should provide Crimson fans plenty of opportunities to cheer on their favorite teams.
The women’s soccer team is looking to regain its momentum after losing three straight games—including a 3-0 loss to BU yesterday afternoon—and falling to a 1-3-1 record. The team takes on the University of Rhode Island tonight at 7 p.m. at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium. The Crimson is looking to score its first home win this season, and the first 75 fans in attendance will score a free T-shirt.
Meanwhile, the No. 6 men’s soccer team heads to the Lobo Classic in New Mexico and will face two teams this weekend. The squad goes up against UC Santa Barbara tonight and New Mexico on Sunday. So far, the men are 2-0-1 on the season and look to score two more wins on the road.
After a rough start to the season, going 2-6 so far, the women’s volleyball team plays three matches this weekend at the Northwestern Invitational. The team faces Marquette this afternoon, Northwestern tomorrow at noon, and Charlotte on Sunday.
The men’s water polo team faces off against MIT this afternoon at home for the ECAC Championships. The team is 2-4 for the season and picked up a win at the Princeton Invitational against George Washington after losing three games last weekend at the same event.
Starting the season, the cross-country team travels to the Bronx for the Iona Meet of Champions tomorrow. The field hockey team takes on Yale in its Ivy opener at home tomorrow afternoon and is looking to score its third win. The squad has dropped the last three games, all on the road.
Finally, the football team opens its season against Holy Cross tomorrow night under the lights at 7 p.m. To read more about the outlook for the Harvard football season, check out The Back Page’s preview, which will be posted later tonight, or The Crimson’s annual preseason supplement, on newsstands today and online tonight!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Stadium is well known for its likeness to the Roman Coliseum. But Harvard Stadium filled with thousands of cheering fans? And with two football teams battling it out under the stars and the bright lights?
It’s not only war. It’s something magical.
“It’s going to be something else when we step out there,” said sophomore running back Treavor Scales. “I have a feeling that when those lights come on, everybody [will know] it’s time to go.”
The Crimson is hoping to start off strong as Saturday night’s game marks the opening of its season. Selected by the national media in a preseason poll as the likely winners of the Ivy League, Harvard will first test itself against reigning Patriot League champion Holy Cross (1-1).
“[This contest is] a chance to find out what kind of football team we are,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We think we have a chance to be a good team, but that’s why you play the games. You’ve got to go out and prove it.”
But the Harvard squad doesn’t want to do it alone.
Almost a year ago, 17,263 excited fans packed into the Harvard Stadium in the home opener under the lights and cheered on the Crimson to a 24-21 victory over Brown. This year, Harvard hopes to see a similar turnout and result.
“We love the support, we really do, especially [in] the night game,” said senior running back Gino Gordon.
“We’re excited for this season,” Scales continued. “[We want to] make sure everyone comes out.”
The 7 p.m. kick-off time not only marks a new season for the Crimson squad, but a new season for Harvard fans. Go out to support your team, and let the magic of Saturday night football continue.

Does this sound familiar? You’ve got that big date with that cute guy from your Econ section on Friday, but your choice outfit was a victim of some Pinot Noir. For many, this would be the end of the world, but at Harvard, we are blessed with more than enough options for you to get your wardrobe back on track.
But where to go, given the multitude of options? We sought to review a few of the dry cleaning options available around campus. We were unable to send out our own items for cleaning to evaluate the final result, so we have based our ratings on a combination of convenience, service and speed, and price. (To make comparing prices easier, we based them on a standard bundle of goods: a two-piece suit, a blouse, a tie, a button-down shirt, and a blazer.)
Hillside Cleaners
Where: 49a Brattle St.
Hours: Mon.-Sat., 7:30 a.m.-6 p.m.
Price: $34.63
Hillside Cleaners, located on Brattle St., is a pretty small store that can seem cramped when you walk in. Like most places, they provide laundry wash, dry and fold for $1.45/lb. Additionally, they offer dry cleaning by the pound, a unique service that is cheaper than dry cleaning individual articles, although they can’t guarantee stain removal. You can also get same day service for an extra charge ($.25 for a shirt) if you drop off before 11 a.m. Hillside Cleaners may not be worth the walk for those who live further down the river, but it is a fine choice for those in the Yard. A big plus for this place is its hours, as it is open more hours on Saturday than any of your other options.
Rating: 7/10
HSA Cleaners
Where: 17 Holyoke St.
Hours: Mon.-Fri. 10 a.m.-6 p.m., Sat. 12 p.m.-5 p.m.
Price: $34
HSA Cleaners has a better location than any other dry cleaning service you could find, especially for those in the Yard or on the river. Chances are that you walk past it on your way to class or to the gym, so HSA might be the best choice for you. Prices are reasonable, and their service takes two days—a tad slower than other stories, so it's not a place you can turn to for emergencies. But for a regular dry cleaning place, its hard to do better.
Rating: 9/10
Cambridge Cleaners
Where: 47 Mt. Auburn St.
Hours: Mon.-Fri. 9 a.m.-7 p.m., Sat. 9 a.m.-6 p.m.
Price: $46.20
Cambridge Cleaners is pricier than other places, and for the budget-minded Harvard student, that’s a big deal. But Cambridge Cleaners also advertises next day service and specializes in shoe repair, which is a positive if either is needed. However, unless you live right across the street in Quincy, or live in Mather and don’t want to walk further, you might want to pass this up for a less expensive alternative.
Rating: 6/10
Rite-Way Dry Cleaners
Where: 4 Hudson St. (Porter Sq.)
Hours: Mon.-Fri. 7:30 a.m.-6:30 p.m., Sat. 8 a.m.-5 p.m.
Price: $35.00
If you are one of those Harvard students who are fortunate enough to live in the Quad, you can still get your dry cleaning done without having to make the trek down to the Yard. Rite-Way Dry Cleaners is located on Hudson St., just two blocks west of Garden St. You can get same day service easily, but the store clerk warned us that on Friday, clothes need to be in by 11 a.m. or else they will not be ready until Monday.
Rating: 7/10
So where does that leave you, the dry clean-ee? After review, it appears that HSA Cleaners might be the best deal, considering their central location and low price. However, if you are in an emergency situation, you might need to try a place with same day service, such as Hillside Cleaners.
Any personal experiences to share? Feel free to leave a comment!

Around 11:40 a.m. this morning, the fire alarm went off in the Science Center, forcing hordes of students (including this correspondent) outside. After waiting around listlessly, we were then allowed back into the building around 12:10 p.m. Wonder what all that was about.

UPDATE: Sept. 18, 2010. Photo added.
Lowell’s hottest men are going shirtless. A new calendar, set to be released towards the end of the semester, will feature Lowell’s sexiest in the first ever “Lowell Swimsuit Edition.”
Alex L.G. Hugon `11 masterminded the concept when he was looking to “give Lowell more of a personality and to do something funny,” he said. His inspiration was Sports Illustrated.
The swimsuit edition, though, is not simply for looks and laughs. Each calendar will cost between $5 and $10, and the proceeds of the sales will be given to a local charity.
The models for the calendar—men who weren’t afraid to show a little skin—were chosen first by Hugon through people he knew and then by Lowell house residents themselves.
“I started with a few of my friends that were roommates, and then I picked a bunch of athletic dudes that I knew through IMs,” Hugon said. “It was a self-selective process really. The guys we ended up with had to be people who were comfortable doing something kind of ridiculous like this.”
According to Hugon, roughly 15 individuals stepped forward to model.
One of these lucky guys is Michael K. Oberst `12, who answered some pressing questions for FlyBy about modeling, swimming, and life.
You're at the beach. Are you wearing: briefs, swim trunks, a straw hat and shirt, or nothing at all?
I would say a towel.
You’ve taken a girl to the beach as your first date. What would you buy her from the concession stand?
A Choco taco – possibly one of the greatest foods on earth.
If you had to name your best attributes, what would you say, and why?
I would say my best physical attribute is going to be my pale white skin because it enables me to cast light wherever I go, no matter the time of day. My other best attribute is blue steel, my look. I’ve gotten lots of compliments on it. [For those wondering, blue steel looks like this.] 
You’re heading out for a swim. Would your destination be the beach, a pool, a Jacuzzi, a lake, or some other body of water? Why?
A Jacuzzi.  Because it’s hard for me to, you know, drown in one of those.
What’s your favorite month of the year?
February, because it’s my birthday. [Even though you can’t swim in February?] Yeah, because I’m turning 21 in February. I’m really, really excited.
If you had to be an aquatic animal, what kind would you be?
I’d be an 800-pound tuna. Or actually, no. I’m going to say a shark because if I stopped swimming I’d die.
Are you single?
Yes, I am.

We recently reported that Crimson Yard UC then-candidate Matt P. Abrams '14 was on a mission to gain Crimson Yard (Pennypacker, Hurlbut, Greenough, and Wigglesworth) freshmen unrestricted access to Adams dining hall. Abrams won his campaign with this boisterous vow, but now the residents of Adams House are determined to make him break his promise.
In an e-mail sent to Abrams and his roommates, Adams House resident Collin A. Rees '12 warned Abrams that Adams residents would assemble in full House regalia and carry their trays of dining hall food to Abrams' room in Pennypacker.
"Congrats on the win, by the way. And you're welcome for the publicity," Rees wrote, explaining that Adams House residents will appear at Abams' doorstep regardless of how Abams felt about it. "It's a better story for everyone involved, we can get to know you guys, we can chat about your platform, or about football, or unicorns, or anything, and everybody wins.  Sound good?"
It turned out very few people from Adams actually showed up at Abrams' door—three by Abrams' count, six by Rees' count.
"We might as well be hostiptable to them," said Abrams, who went the extra effort to put out Fruity Tooties, Capri Sun juice drinks, and chocolate pudding for his self-invited guests.
"It ended up being a fun thing," said Rees, who serves as social chair of the House Committee and is a self-proclaimed Adamsian (Adams House fan). "I just wanted to get to know him and talk about his issues."
So far, the privilege Abrams is after is still reserved for Pfoho residents, who had to resort to war to earn the right to eat in Adams.  But it looks like Abrams is prepared for the food fight.

Aspiring actors, filmmakers, writers and fans swarmed the Adams Upper House Common Room Friday to hear actor Aaron E. Eckhart of “The Dark Knight” and “Thank You for Smoking” talk about his acting career through an informal Q& A session. The hour-long conversation was presented by the Harvard Undergraduate Television speaker series.
Dressed in casual outfit—black V-neck sweater, khaki pants and suede boots—Eckhart shared insights into his life as an actor, tips on dealing with rejections and advices on pursuing your dream.
“You guys are the future,” he said. “As long as you have something good, who’s going to turn you down?”
At one point, Eckhart gathered laughter from the audience when a student asked for his criteria for choosing a film.
“Who’s the girl?” he said, making the girls sitting in the front row swoon (as a matter of fact, all the seats in the front were occupied by girls).
He encouraged the students to put their personality into every role they play. He added that, while playing the role of Harvey Dent/Two-Face in “The Dark Knight,” he read the comic books to figure out his character and understand what the face (or the faces) represents.
Though he said he enjoys surfing, biking, running and taking photos in his spare time, Eckhart said his true passion lies in movies. He also said that someday he would like to someday write, direct and produce his own movies.
Eckhart is in town for Friday night’s world premier of “To Be Friends,” written and directed by his brother James Lawrence Eckhart.
