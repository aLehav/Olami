After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Massachusetts House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo unveiled a comprehensive bill that seeks to liberalize Massachusetts’s gambling laws. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 failed in a similar effort in 2007, but the tide may be turning. Yesterday, the bill won the committee backing that it needed in order to proceed, meaning that Massachusetts may be well on its way to joining the list of over 30 other states that allow hotel casinos.
We encourage the state legislature to pass DeLeo’s bill and hasten the construction of the two resort-style casinos and four race-track slot machine banks for which it calls. Although we recognize that gambling may not be the most productive industry, or the most morally sound, the economic benefits for both the public and private sectors that follow from allowing in-state casino operation far outweigh the moral grievances that some individual citizens contend should force the government to disallow it. So long as Massachusetts actively works to prevent and counteract the negative consequences excessive gambling can have on society, we see no reason that the state should continue to deny individuals the chance to win (or lose) big.
It’s no secret that Massachusetts is badly in need of jobs and money. House leaders who are in favor of the bill estimate that the casinos and slots it proposes will create 15,000 jobs for Bay State-ers. Industry officials are even more optimistic, saying that each casino could generate up to 12,000 construction jobs and 7,000 permanent ones in the service sector thereafter. The state could ensure that job creation is maximized by requiring casino developers to invest a high minimum amount of money in the construction, perhaps around $500 million or even more. Such a requirement would also go a long way toward preventing the seediness that is popularly associated with gambling and instead fostering a luxury resort experience.
If passed, the bill would also make great strides toward closing the state’s multi-billion dollar budget deficit. Simply selling the licenses for the slots and casinos would generate an immediate one-time payment of $75 million to $100 million that would help tremendously in the short term. In the longer term, the state would collect 25 percent of the revenue from both casinos, adding a projected $250 million to $300 million dollars per year to its dry coffers.
Opponents who contend that having gambling in-state would bring on a tidal wave of immorality should recognize, first and foremost, that Connecticut—a state which permits casinos and gamblings—is not very far away. Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun bring in billions in revenue for themselves and hundreds of millions more for the state of Connecticut. The residents of Massachusetts with the worst gambling problems already have an outlet for them only a short drive away and are probably currently spending their money across the border. Casual gamblers, too, take their money out of state to play. Massachusetts would be wise to keep this money circulating in-state by opening casinos here rather than allowing it to flood out. In this instance, making gambling only slightly more accessible would mean a tremendous increase in the amount of state funds that could be spent in a worthy manner.
We do recognize, however, that in-state casinos would allow for a more impulsive breed of gambling that could possibly make problems more severe where they exist already and create ones where they don’t. If the state is to bring casino-style gambling within its borders, it must also recognize that a handful of its citizens may develop an addiction. Massachusetts should dedicate some of the revenue generated from any future casinos to providing infrastructural support for programs that aim to temper and cure gambling-related issues among citizens.
This does not, however, necessitate a publicly run entity. For instance, the state could provide tax incentives to private organizations or mental-health professionals seeking to address gambling issues. Any opportunity for legislators and individuals to create innovative solutions to new problems is a good one. One such solution employed by the state of New Jersey in order to combat gambling problems is a system that allows citizens to voluntarily ban themselves from in-state casinos. Massachusetts would do well to provide the same service and encourage its citizens—and employ its workers—to come up with others as well.
Though casinos are often thought of as immoral institutions that promote unhealthy behavior, such costs are far outweighed by the benefits that Massachusetts would receive from having them in-state and not right across the border. When citizens are allowed to gamble responsibly—and those who don’t receive help that is sponsored by the state—Massachusetts, not the house, will be the true winner.

While Roland Emmerich’s “2012” was not spectacular as a cinematic effort, its premise wasn’t entirely wrong—the end of history is almost here. It’s slightly more than two years away, though, according to the academic Francis Fukuyama. In “The End of History and the Last Man,” Professor Fukuyama famously argued that liberal democracy will become the last form of government, the final product of the evolutionary mechanism that is history. But both the director of this would-be blockbuster and the renowned political scientist got it wrong. While Fukuyama’s vision of the future was surely more accurate than Emmerich’s, he didn’t dream wildly enough.
The equilibrium Fukuyama anticipates would likely contain not only a certain regime but also a certain view of liberty. Specifically, the trajectory of modern liberal democracy seems aimed at an apex of liberty in which freedom is maximized within the constraints of the “harm principle.” The harm principle states that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a political community against his will is to prevent harm to others. Such an idea boils down to a simple but effective approach to life: “Don’t hurt me, and I won’t hurt you.” History, if it does function as Fukuyama posits, would be just as likely to give the citizens of the future the same philosophical outlook as well as the same political organization.
The reason for this eventual uniformity is that the ever-upward climb towards personal freedom arises from a pluralism, which, under specific conditions fostered by a liberal democracy, invites a type of relativism. Citizens see a difference of moral opinion, and since they are uncomfortable with claims of moral objectivity, they find it easy to pick the most conflict-free arrangement. The harm principle utilized in liberal democracy makes governance easier, but it surely has its drawbacks. This idea has been identified as the forerunner to a disintegration of protection of minors, altruism, and other social goods. Decisions on such issues, if this intuitive preference against conflict prevails, are more likely to tend toward freedom over protection.
An extreme instance of this made headlines, including Sunday’s New York Times article on the end-of-life issues surrounding the personal struggle involved in a patient’s fight to continue living in the face of severe illness. Patients with the opposite temperament—those who no longer want to fight and end their lives—have also garnered national media attention. Here it’s clearest that the community of citizens within liberal democracy becomes a house divided over the question of whether society should leave man free to destroy himself. This difficult question forces an even more difficult choice between liberty and limit.
Very few countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, have chosen the former option on a nationwide level, and here in the U.S., Washington and Oregon have followed suit. But even without such drastic permissiveness, there is a link between Fukuyama’s predicted champion, liberal democracy, and a rejection of constraint. A democracy that attempts to retain any sense of right and wrong beyond the obvious indicators of injury and illness faces an uphill battle in light of this aversion of conflict.
At stake are issues that, while fundamental to societal preservation, don’t have a clear-cut harm, such as the keeping of profanity from children or the maintenance of monogamy. In matters such as these, this final stage in the historical process poses a danger by prioritizing liberty over any societal standard that’s not rooted in avoidance of concrete harm.
Yet the specific historical circumstances in which liberal democracy flourished are likely to keep society’s normalizing compass spinning. The U.S. is a notable example of this—a society that has retained a sense of morality outside of the harm principle but is unsure where to proceed next. As fewer and fewer citizens in Fukuyama’s predicted world see the value in virtue, society would be likely to advance toward a morally minimal liberalism. This philosophical stance, coupled with a democratic political organization, is likely to make the end of history closer than you’d think.
The culture wars in the U.S. are a good example of the more general societal conflict over whether time’s arrow points the way toward a world that is good or, for that matter, happy. Empirical studies give some indication that progress is not a recipe for satisfaction, even though citizens are freer—perhaps, at liberty to be as unhappy as they are unconstrained. Society might not be on the path that Fukuyama or the preceding picture suggests, but any reclamation of societal standards—such as those underlying monogamy or speech regulations—would require a firm commitment to the ideal rather than the free.
An only somewhat less-frightening version of “2012” would involve the end of history arriving with no earthquakes, solar flares, or eruption of mountains in national parks. Instead, the end of history in this epic would arrive incrementally, as societal changes saturate the public sphere with freedom. In this apocalypse, heroism would arise not from a struggle to convince others that the world can be saved from external destruction, but instead that it could be safeguarded from disintegration from within.

A subject may well be confusing, but that is no cause for its abandonment. As I researched this article, my understanding of feminism’s subtleties became less certain. However, one central belief remains: How can a movement that advocates equal rights be so unpopular? Rebecca West claimed, “I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute.” Leaving aside the intricacies of whether wet t-shirt contests entail empowerment or self-inflicted chauvinism, the rejection of feminism’s central core—equal opportunities for men and women—is perplexing. At the beginning of yet another decade, why are women still the second sex?
The most bizarre and repulsive aspect of feminism’s status is the desire among many women to shun social equality. “Social equality” can be loosely defined as the potential for both men and women to have access to the same roles and activities. However, perhaps as an attempt to appear meek and traditionally feminine, numerous women I’ve encountered have stated their aversion to this concept. A few months ago, author Fay Weldon claimed that women should pick up their husband’s socks, and in a response article that gathered reactions from 15 publicly prominent women, the majority agreed. Attached to the housewife role is the strong expectation that women are the primary parent figure. In an article about ten Princeton women (of whom only one, who has no children, works full time), each cited the need to care for their children as a reason to stop working. Not one even seemed to consider the notion that their husband might have to make a similar decision or share the duties towards their children. Furthermore, there remains a distinct lack of sisterly unity. For example, Princeton’s first female president, Shirley Tilghman, voiced surprise at the lack of reaction among female students when The Daily Princetonian suggested that she was practicing gender-based affirmative action.
An individual choice to pick up their husband’s socks is understandable, but the indiscriminate expectation for all women to do the same—the very inverse of female unity—is truly reprehensible. In a discussion about feminism, a friend claimed that, “life is easier as a girl.” The point is not whether it is preferable to be a mother or a lawyer, but (to use a cliché) that all women should be able to choose. And those who choose to be a housewife (or a lawyer) should not view their own role as a duty to all women.
The result of social inequalities is legal inequalities, especially in the workplace. As women alone are expected to choose between work and family, fewer women work, and so there are natural workplace barriers against women. In 2001, a Columbia University study found that 89 percent of men took paternity leave after the birth of their child but that the majority took less than one week off. As a result of this disparity, employers are much less likely to hire women of typical marrying age, and so there are fewer women and greater obstacles higher up the career ladder. Although many women opt out of work when they have children, the drastic difference between the equal number of women in training programs, and the tiny minority in top positions, suggests discrimination. As of 2008 there were only three women (and one with real power) in Goldman Sachs’ management committee of 29, while in 2003 only 1.6 percent of C.E.O.s of Fortune 500 companies were women.
A clear and undisruptive means to rectify this disparity is to alter maternity and paternity leave so that a couple may divide the leave between them as they wish.  Consequentially, the same number of weeks overall would be taken off work, so the economy would not be affected. Furthermore, men of parenting age would have less of an unjust advantage over women, as employers could not be definitely assume that women (and not men) will pause their work in order to raise children.
The one stale, clichéd response to advocates of feminism is that men and women are innately different. Of course, given the biological support, it would be folly to deny that there are general differences between men and women. However, there are exceptions to every one of the usual character differences. And just as a physically strong woman should be able to be a builder, a particularly parental man should be able to be a househusband without controversy. Men and women will never be the same, and I expect that even under absolute equality there would be more stay-at-home mothers than fathers. But feminists do not demand sameness, only equality—that men and women should be able to choose their role­ uninhibited by gender.
My argument—the lack of unity amongst women, the female aversion to appearing assertive, and the women’s burden of choosing between family and work—are the rudimentary basics of feminist theory. However, there is an ugly connotation to feminism that should be dispelled, and popular support for the movement is the only realistic means to reform its image and obtain equality. Sexism still stubbornly continues to prevail, both in society and the workplace, and, as such, feminism unquestionably deserves greater support.

“I’m so old!” goes the familiar whine of Harvard seniors when talking to underclassmen. This comment strikes me as bizarre because most of the time the age gap between the senior and underclassman is less than three years. There are only two places such an age gap is significant: college and a nursing home. Before and after our Harvard careers we have and will probably associate with people from ages seven to seventy who are at very different stages of life from us. Therefore, the lack of such age diversity at college is not just bizarre, but also potentially dangerous. It causes us to lose perspective on superficial issues—no, you can’t have pizza for three meals a day after you graduate—and more serious ones—we are all going to age someday. Therefore, college students should work to counter campus age homogeneity by actively seeking friends and acquaintances of different ages.
It makes sense that we associate largely with people of the same age. This phenomenon is common across age groups; a study by University of Berkeley sociologist Claude Fischer found that 72 percent of the close friends of Detroit men were within eight years of their age. However, the possibility of a non-age diverse friend circle is magnified at colleges because in most campus situations everyone living close to you is your age. “Residential proximity, age homogeneity, similarity and complementarity,” are the descriptors of adult friendships according to the “Encyclopedia of Adult Development,” and in a college situation the first two often coincide.
For many people, this is, in fact, a great advantage of college. In our garden of youth, it is socially acceptable to drink on Mondays, wake up at noon, and wear sweatpants all the time. The dating options are plentiful, and unsightly wrinkles and receding hairlines are largely out of sight.
However, just like living in any other demographic bubble, age homogeneity can cause us to lose perspective. After hearing me fret over a course grade one of my academic advisors, reminded me “The skills that make you academically successful are different from the skills that are valuable in the workplace.” When you get wrapped up in the measures of and goals of college life, it’s useful to be reminded that Harvard is a four-year world whose influence will eventually yield to that of some employer or spouse you haven’t even met yet—so we should prepare ourselves accordingly.
And it is not as difficult as it may seem to do this. There are ways to break out the age homogeneity of our circles, and we should make use of them. Tutors, House Masters, teaching fellows, professors, HUDS staff, the little kids running around the dining halls there are many people within our community at stages of life very different from undergraduates. Conversations with them can be seen as necessary checks on the tendency to conceive student life as the only type of life.
It’s ironic that age segregation at college goes largely unquestioned, given that this reality in other parts of society is so contentious. Age segregation among the elderly is a source of serious debate; the question of whether retirement communities prevent social integration is a contentious one. Although the concerns may be slightly different in the case of college students, the problem is the same. Living with hundreds of people your age just isn’t normal, so let’s try not to get used to it.

If you don’t think the idea of two back-to-back murders committed with a foil-wrapped steak is funny, director Jake Goldberger’s comedic thriller “Don McKay” probably isn’t for you. The film—Goldberger’s first—aims to be darkly humorous with this incident and others even more absurd, but garners laughs mostly at its own expense. Despite a talented cast including Thomas Hayden Church (“Sideways”) and Elisabeth J. Shue ’00 (“Leaving Las Vegas”), the script lacks the subtlety and confidence to pull off the sophisticated black humor to which it aspires.
Down-on-his-luck janitor Don McKay (Church) receives a letter from his high school sweetheart Sonny (Shue), informing him that she is critically ill and wants to see him before she dies. Abandoning his swiffer, he rushes to her side—but what begins as a redemptive romantic comedy turns twisted and eerie as soon as Don sets foot in his hometown. Sonny differs greatly from the girl McKay remembers, and seems strangely vital for a dying woman. Her caretakers, live-in nurse Marie (Melissa Leo) and Dr. Lance Pryce (James Rebhorn), are on suspiciously intimate terms with their patient. Remembering their long history together, Sonny asks Don to share her bed, and the two sleep together on his first night back. The following morning Dr. Pryce assaults Don in a rage, and he kills the doctor in self-defense, stashing him in the backyard.
When Don receives a phone call from the dead Dr. Pryce advising him to get out of town, he does so, despite Sonny’s pleas. But when she begs him to return a few months later, he somewhat inexplicably obliges, only to be further manipulated and taken advantage of. During this second visit, identities are divulged one after the other, allegiances between characters switch every five seconds, and the plot dissolves into a convoluted mess that comes to a head in the aforementioned steak murder scene.
Goldberger intends this final segment, with its ridiculously rapid succession of plot twists and accusations flying back and forth, as a parody of a film noir murder mystery, in which the plot unfolds, the guilty reveal themselves, and all the pieces fall into place in one climactic scene. He is fairly successful—the series of deceitful maneuvers and murders is entertaining, and so absurd that it’s funny. Here, Goldberger successfully creates the satirical thriller he was aiming for.
Unfortunately, the majority of the film does not live up to these intentions. During the first hour, viewers are subjected to stilted dialogue and heavy-handed jokes. These awkward one-liners often fall to Leo, in her role as the disturbingly cheerful and deceptively prim Marie. When McKay first arrives at Sonny’s house, he notices a “home sweet home” sign in the hallway, to which someone has attached a large axe. When he expresses his surprise, violins screech forebodingly, and Marie answers, “You never know when you may need an axe!” Though Leo’s performance is genuinely creepy and amusing, her delivery could not prevent this hackneyed line from falling flat.
Another similar moment occurs the morning after Don sleeps with Sonny. He comes across Marie tending the garden, and when he declines her invitation to join in the work, she replies, “I suppose you’ve spilled enough seed in the house already.” These lines are so over-the-top, that perhaps they would have benefited from correspondingly exaggerated performances by the actors. But Goldberger and his cast for the most part insist on taking characters seriously, creating an effect that is disturbing and bizarre without being larger-than-life—or funny.
On the other hand, Shue does overact in her role as Sonny, and it just feels even more stilted and awkward.  Hayden Church’s performance is more compelling. As a primarily comic actor—he played the sex-crazed bachelor Jack in “Sideways” and the laughable villain of  “George of the Jungle”—he is good at balancing a sense of humor with the demands of playing a more serious, troubled character.
Overall, “Don McKay” has some fun moments and talented actors, but suffers from serious tonal problems. Though it is clear that Goldberger wanted to create a black comedy, the cast’s serious performances, which would be more effective in a straightforward  drama, never mesh with the absurd scenarios in which they find themselves.

Though it clearly won’t make any critic’s top ten list this year, there is no doubt that “Clash of the Titans” is an entertaining film. The pace of the action, dazzling special effects, and hokey one-liners rarely lets up.  But though the audience may enjoy the film as it unfolds, the quality of this unabashedly derivative movie itself is definitely less than godly.
As with many Greek tales, “Clash of the Titans” begins with the hubris of a great king.  The king of the city-state of Argos (which looks remarkably similar to Minas Tirith of the “Lord of the Rings” films) decides to wage war on the gods by destroying a statue of Zeus and issuing a city-wide prayer strike.  After he is convinced by a resentful Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Zeus (Liam Neeson), decked out in his fabulous glitter suit, orders the destruction of Argos and the massacre of its citizens as a deterrent to other mortals who may plan to cook their rabbits instead of sacrificing them.
Meanwhile, a young, handsome, and, of course, muscular Perseus (Sam Worthington) is taken to Argos after his adoptive family is killed by Hades.  The film continues as a quest tale as Perseus travels to defeat various demons, monsters, and mythical creatures accompanied by his team of rag-tag misfits, including four soldiers either too young or too old to fight, two wacky ethnic hunters, a magical man made of living tree bark, and a mysterious immortal who has watched Perseus since birth.
Despite its slight basis on a mythological story, the film borrows heavily from other recent movies of the fantasy adventure genre.  Io (Gemma Arterton), the mystical advisor and lover of the movie’s protagonist, is—in both characterization and appearance—greatly reminiscent of Lady Arwen of “Lord of the Rings” fame.  She speaks in a delicate yet powerful voice, she is immortal, and she maintains an ethereal poise and beauty even while being chased by giant scorpions.
It is often easy to forget which movie is being watched.  The visual look of the demons and monsters also seem borrowed from other films.  Hades’ flying minions look like the death eaters from “Harry Potter,” the former king of Argos (Perseus’ third dad) evokes the image of Ephialties in “300,” and the steed-like giant scorpions are perhaps too similar in purpose to the elephants in “Return of the Kings.”
The rest of the characters function more as  shallow types rather than direct appropriations. Worthington, (whose semi-human characters in “Avatar” and the abysmal “Teminator Salvation” are remarkably similar to that of Perseus), plays the inexperienced, yet brave and naturally talented “chosen one” struggling internally to balance idealism and principle with his desire to save humanity.  Determined to avenge his father’s death at the hands of the gods, Perseus needs to decide whether or not to use the gifts of his true father, Zeus, which include a flying horse, a gold coin, and a light saber. (Yes, an Ancient Greek light saber.)
The most frustrating part of the movie is the sheer number of major characters.  It is difficult to develop 15 personalities in less than two hours, especially when those hours are chock-full of fabulous shining armor and giant scorpions.  Often a supposedly major character will have an epiphany, only to be killed three minutes later.
The most frustrating character is Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos).  The beginning of the movie suggests that that she will be a major player as the events of the story unfold.  And yet Andromeda is essentially forgotten until the end of the movie when Perseus returns to Argos to save her.  The film could have been improved if characters such as the princess, one or two of the Argonese soldiers, and Perseus’ third dad were simply removed.
The dialogue in “Clash of the Titans” simultaneously makes up the worst and most entertaining parts of the film.  With gems such as, “You’re not just part man and part god, you’re the best of both,” and “We live, we fight, we die for each other,” one cannot keep from being entertained.
Despite the film’s derivative script, the special effects are simply suburb.  The title sequence of the film is a dazzling sequence of mythological imagery that makes the cost of watching the film in 3D justified (though the rest of film is probably just as good in 2D).  The kraken and the giant scorpions were also fun to watch and the computer graphics were seamless interwoven with the actors’ interactions.  Medusa stands out as a particularly stunning and realistic computer-generated character.  Her movements and incredibly seamless facial expressions completely put a very interesting spin on the famous mythological archetype.
Despite the bad dialogue, the clichéd characters, and the random tree-man with a grenade-like blue heart, “Clash of the Titans” is generally worth seeing.  The film is fun and entertaining, both intentionally and unintentionally.  Just don’t watch the film hoping to be awed by anything other than the special effects.

Passion and a crazed commitment to maintaining power are two essential elements that any aspiring fascist ruler should possess. In the case of Benito Mussolini, these were elements that he embraced not only in his political career, but also in his private life. “Vincere” explores the secret life of Benito Mussolini’s lover—and self-proclaimed spouse—Ida Dalser and the emotional and psychological torture she endures as a result of being swept under the rug. In this chilling account, Ida’s resolve and sanity are tested as she attempts to fight the unified powers of Il Duce’s regime.
In this fictional recreation of her life, Ida, played by Giovanna Mezzogiorno, is shoved into the shadows of secluded homes and mental hospitals as everyone around her insists that she forget the past and the father of her child. Mezzogiorno delivers a stunning performance, masterfully portraying the desperation of a scorned lover. Her obsession with her imagined marriage to Mussolini (Filippo Timi)—a problem first and foremost because he was already married with children before his affair with Ida—is second only to her resolve that she hasn’t imagined anything and is justified in her demands for legitimacy.
Mezzogiorno’s performance is enhanced exponentially by the powerful imagery of determination that accompanies her progressively bitter outlook on life. As she is seated in front of the daunting board of psychologists, Ida removes the human skull from the doctor’s desk to let them know that she is not swayed by the danger of her demise and will not be intimidated. Her obsession transforms into a desire for retribution when she realizes Mussolini has long since left her behind in light of his political successes, many of which she helped him achieve early in his career.
The score accompanying the various climatic scenes—Ida and Benito’s first love scene, for instance—works marvelously to accent the frightening and sinister aura that surrounds their relationship. The combination of shrill flute lines and harsh stringed instruments in serious scenes like the opening town forum provide an eerie accompaniment to Mussolini’s austerity, a creepiness that accurately complements Mussolini’s bloody thirst for power.
The passionate dialogue delivered by nearly all the characters also helps to portray the volatility of the relationships that surround Mussolini. Ida’s interaction with Mussolini’s lover while he is hospitalized is a prime example of this: this lover, a nun nonetheless, exclaims, “I’ll kill her; I’ll rip her ears off!” in an emotional explosion in reaction to Ida’s entrance. Throughout the entire film, emotions fail to flag.
Despite the film’s varied artistic strengths, a significant drawback are the sometimes-confusing transitions and occasional lack of continuity. The latter is especially evident when Ida’s son is suddenly introduced as an adult after an inexplicable temporal leap in the narrative. To make matters even more confusing, the adult son is played by the same actor who portrays Mussolini. Furthermore, although the montages of real-life Italian scenes of political turmoil accompanying the events in the film constitute a very interesting approach to crafting a fictionalized historical account, their unexpected placement undermines the sense of fluidity.
The wonderful acting on the part of the main characters and the intense depiction of the entire account very much outweigh the film’s faults. For example, early in the film, Mussolini menacingly barks, “It’s ten past five, I challenge God!” This powerful performance, and the many others like it, ensures that this film will haunt viewers long after they have left the cinema.

Whoever thought that putting Miley Cyrus in the role of the headstrong rebel while still attempting to maintain a family-friendly vibe was a good idea obviously had not taken a second look at the script of “The Last Song.”
Based on a Nicholas Sparks novel, the film explores the family drama that ensues when Ronnie (Cyrus) and her brother are sent to spend the summer with their father (Steve Miller). Ronnie clearly resents her father because of her parents’ recent divorce, a resentment that leads her to push aside her brilliant talent as a Julliard-bound pianist in favor of an emotional seclusion from anything that reminds her of him. However, upon meeting the handsome Will Blakelee, played by Liam Hemsworth, Ronnie is able to soften her heart and open it to her family again, bonding with her father through their shared love for music.
The bland dialogue of the opening scenes pretty much sets the tone for what one can expect from the following hour and a half. As her brother makes reference to her recent arrest, Ronnie replies, oh-so-cleverly, “Jonah, I didn’t do it, ok? Just stay out of it!” It is awkward to watch this seemingly edgy character forced to fit into a family role, especially when she has to balance her soft, caring side for her brother with her bitter hatred for her father. This role is also one that should require more foul language or outward disrespect for authority figures than Cyrus is permitted to deliver in this Disney production. Thus, the outward harshness that Ronnie is trying to emit seems wholly at odds with her saccharine actions.
Although this film deals with some very heavy issues and attempts to paint a touching account of family bonding, the film moves far too quickly to be taken seriously. A serious emotional toll is packed into this 107-minute film, not leaving much room to explore these problems very deeply at all. Perhaps the most astounding moment of emotional insincerity—but probably not too surprising after witnessing the many other clichéd moments throughout—is Will’s sudden proclamation of love which occurs very soon after he first meets Ronnie. Obviously over-the-top, this scene makes it clear that this film is meant to be more of a heartthrob fantasy for young girls everywhere rather than a realistic portrayal of love.
The character motivations in the film are also shallower than one would hope for. Discovering that Ronnie’s dark secret is that she was arrested for shoplifting and that her father didn’t actually commit the crime he was accused of feels entirely anticlimactic. It constantly feels like the film takes the easy way out, resolving conflicts by claiming they were never serious to begin with. The film never embraces the darker emotional toll that one would expect of such a supposedly dysfunctional family.
Some slower scenes, such as the time Ronnie spends with her father in the hospital, reveal that Cyrus has the acting chops required for embracing a three-dimensional role. In general, these few moments are all too brief. However, to the film’s credit, Cyrus’ interactions with her on-screen father do become more natural as the film progresses.
While all the relationships of the family fit together naturally, the peripheral presence of Ronnie’s rebel friend Blaze stands at odds with everything else that is occurring in the plot. Introduced as Ronnie’s first female friend, their quick bonding suggests that Blaze will be an ever-present source of camaraderie for the estranged newcomer. However, this character disappears for the entire middle segment of the film, only to reappear at the very end as someone who Ronnie has to rescue from her own emotional crisis. The lack of incorporation of Ronnie’s friend in the primary family drama makes the character of Blaze an awkward tool seemingly placed in the story only as a target for Ronnie’s heroism.
Although this film makes a valiant attempt to depict a moving story of the strength of family bonds, “The Last Song” overshoots the emotional factor by miles. By shying away from the darker tone required of the subject matter, the film is nothing but inert.

What happens when you put together an orphan living in a medieval abbey, a Celtic manuscript with magical powers, a spunky fairy residing in the forest, Vikings who are about to attack, and a serpent god who ends up devouring itself after being conquered by the chalk of destiny?
What you get is “The Secret of Kells,” a 75-minute independent Irish film directed by Tomm Moore and nominated for best animated feature at this year’s Academy Awards. It is a mesmerizing and poetic film that combines narrative momentum, conceptual depth, and an impressively stylized aesthetic.
This breathtaking adventure movie is original in many ways. “The Secret of Kells” is 95 percent hand-drawn, a technique nearly abandoned since the Disney Golden Age, and it stands out as a visual gem. Moore uses vibrant colors to create an innovative animation which weaves together medieval Celtic art and unique, contemporary imagery. On a plot level, the stakes in the film are not so much about losing one’s life as losing sacred spiritual knowledge.
The protagonist of “The Secret of Kells” is Brendan, a charming 12-year-old red-headed boy. The film follows Brendan’s journey as he tries to understand what is important, decides who to obey and disobey, and courageously searches for his own path. The authority he has always looked up to is his stern uncle, Abbot Cellach, who prioritizes, above all, the construction of a wall that would protect the abbey against a Viking attack. But Brendan soon meets Aidan, an abbot who believes in finishing and preserving a sacred manuscript. This manuscript will become the Book of Kells, today regarded as Ireland’s finest national treasure.
The misunderstanding Moore presents between Cellach and Aidan is the kind that could occur between a Silicon Valley tycoon and a Harvard Classics professor. The two abbots, one prioritizing physical defense and the other prioritizing books, synthesize an urgent dilemma: how does one choose between technological and intellectual development? Moore examines the power of material strength versus the power of ideas, and to what extent one is necessary for the other.
According to Cellach, “It is through the strength of our walls that [others] will come to trust the strength of our books,” and the goal of the construction is “to save civilization, to save our book.” Aidan, however, believes that “people must have books so they may have hope.”
The disagreement between the two raises the question of whether it is more important to prepare oneself for the future materially or spiritually, and whether it is more important to guard or to spread knowledge. Protection against the outside can manifest itself either in physical isolation or in intellectual and spiritual enlightenment. When the Vikings attack, Brendan says he must make ink, because while people die, their work remains, and walls can be destroyed more easily than books or faith.
In “The Secret of Kells,” Moore makes an important reconciliation between structured civilization and the natural world. As Brendan contemplates whether or not to disobey his uncle and venture out into the forest, Aidan tells him, “You learn more from the trees and rocks and see more miracles in the forest than in any other place—this is what the abbots knew long ago.” Moore links the two visually, showing similar symbols inside the abbey and outside in nature. In the forest, two orphans, a girl and a boy, one from the natural pagan world, and the other from Christianized civilization, meet and become friends. She teaches him to climb a tree, while he explains to her what a book is.
Moore’s message that spirituality is inherent in all living things is very powerful—somewhat similar to the message James Cameron was trying to portray in “Avatar” but without the commercial cheesiness.
“The Secret of Kells” is enchanting and imaginative. It is funny, at times scary, and always beautiful. Moore effortlessly intertwines historical facts with visions, legends, and imagination, as he presents universal ideas within the make-believe.

“We Americans are great forgetters.” So declares reporter Welborn McIntyre in one of the oldest fragments of Ralph Ellison’s unfinished second novel, “Three Days Before the Shooting....” Previously available only in heavily-edited form as “Juneteenth,” it is a work in which the most significant voices are those dedicated to memory and to the preservation and interpretation of experience—whether through reporting, storytelling, preaching, or even prophecy. McIntyre’s proclamation stands as a challenge to an entire nation to, in the words of jazzman-turned-preacher Alonzo Hickman, “give melodic coherence to a progression of dissonant chords.”
Spanning over 2,000 manuscript pages and four decades of work, the novel’s incompleteness does not undermine the masterful and comprehensive expression of an author whose first novel alone, “Invisible Man,” was enough to vault him into  20th century literary canon. Like “Invisible Man,” Ellison’s unfinished novel addresses the construction of personal, racial, and national identities. The sheer number of voices represented makes this second effort a Faulknerian pinwheel of shifting perspectives. In his notes, Ellison explains that he was attempting to create in “intricate dialogue” among his characters.
From these many voices, two primary characters emerge to drive the dialogue. Reverend Hickman is “God’s Trombone,” a powerful preacher who discovers the same joy in the vigor and spirituality of his preaching as he had in making “heartfelt patterns of soul-felt sound” on his trombone. Unlike the well-defined character of Hickman, white senator Adam Sunraider—originally named “Bliss” by Hickman, his former foster parent—eludes definition. Little of what Ellison left behind provides any explanation for Sunraider’s radical transformations, as he changes from Reverend-in-training to filmmaker, to powerful race-baiting politician.
However, the purpose of this character becomes clearer when he meets his eventual fate. When Sunraider is shot in the middle of a Senate address by Severen, his long-abandoned son, he faces the consequences of his unwillingness to come to terms with his past. Examining the shooter’s body, McIntyre wonders whether Severen’s attempt on his father’s life might have been, for the son, “his best, his most meaningful assertion of self”—an assertion that Sunraider never made. Sunraider’s inability to understand himself is illustrated when, as a filmmaker, he is unable to identify why a particular film reel stirs him to terrible wonderment. He can only ask himself: “Why these images, and what was their power?”
Because the novel contains many story lines, characters, and flashbacks, the plot can often lack cohesion, especially without the connections Ellison would presumably have made between characters and episodes. Trippy visions of talking buzzards and hitching-post men have startling force but seem disconnected from the central story line, and some of Hickman and Sunraider’s extended flashback sequences stall without a strong narrative arc to support them. Nevertheless, the intrigue of these two characters and the vividness of their stories—however disjointed they may be—is more than enough to make “Three Days” engrossing.
In one particularly memorable episode, Hickman leads his church group to the Lincoln Memorial. Looking up into Lincoln’s eyes with “their sad revelation of what it means to be a man of vulnerable heart and floundering mind who found clinging to an elusive ideal more desirable than all the pride and glory of great wealth and great armies,” Hickman exclaims to himself, ”Yes! And with all I know about the things you had to do to be you and remain yourself—Yes! You are one of the few who ever earned the right to be called ‘Father.’” In this moment, the reverend discovers his power to forge his own meaning from a confused reality.
Ellison, a blues man himself, seems most at home writing in Hickman’s rhythmic cadence, oftentimes lulling but punctuated with ecstatic outbursts of emotion. But he also finds resonant expression in the simple, clear voice of Bliss’s early memories and seems to favor this more restrained style in some of his later compositions. Recalling the love affair that would end in the birth of his son and future assailant, Bliss reflects: “High up the trees flurried with birdsong, and one clear note sang above the rest, a lucid soaring strand of sound; while in the grass cicadas dreamed.” Ellison’s ability to give the voices of his characters such melodious presentation is perhaps the most impressive single aspect of this book.
The thoroughness of the publisher’s collection helps to highlight the virtuosity of Ellison’s work. Quickly written drafts from the 1950s are presented alongside Ellison’s final computer files from the early 1990s. Because several scenes are represented multiple times, it is possible to see Ellison’s attempts to refine and unify his work. This provides rare insight into the writing process of a literary master—even if that writing process was not wholly successful.
But “Three Days” is not simply a literary curiosity, whose appeal would be confined to the aspiring author or the Ellison specialist. The incompleteness of the novel does not detract from its overall power. “I was awed by the sweep of it,” says McIntyre as he is led into the war-rent ruins of a French cathedral, “and the very damage, the smashed incompleteness, made me realize as never before the grandeur of its inspiration.” The same might be said of “Three Days Before the Shooting...,” a collection whose lack of narrative cohesion makes the book itself a commentary on Ellison’s declaration of the essentially fragmented nature of our experience.
The final sequences of Ellison’s narrative, which occur early on in his manuscript, leave Sunraider facing not hopelessness but uncertainty. Bliss lies in critical condition but is still alive, with Hickman helping him finally retrace the complexity of his muddled experience. Hickman’s advice to Bliss is equally applicable to Ellison’s unfinished novel: “Somewhere through all the falseness and the forgetting,” Hickman urges, “there is something solid and good.”

If “Beatrice and Virgil” were a piece of music, it would be an extended fugue, beginning so quietly as to be almost inaudible, and culminating in a moment of overwhelming noise followed by silence. With each new piece of his story, Yann Martel examines the form of the novel and how it functions as a means of communication. The Holocaust is his vehicle for this exploration, as he tries many different styles of writing in his attempt to find a voice to protest this act of genocide. The novel contains fragmentary portions of a play, as well as another novel, Flaubert’s “The Legend of St. Julian the Hospitalier.” It is through the fragmentary nature of his work that Martel is able to evoke the sense of fear and claustrophobia that his subject matter can leave in its wake.
Evoking the teasing style of Italian authors such as Italo Calvino or Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, Martel leads his reader on a chase through a house of mirrors. “Beatrice and Virgil” is slyly autobiographical and self-referential. It begins by telling the story of an author named Henry and his struggles to get his latest opus published. He has written a dual book and essay that seek to bring the Holocaust out of the stultifying realm of historical narrative and first-hand accounts into the realm of fiction. According to Henry, it is only in fiction that the  memory can live forever and continue to grow, thus saving the Holocaust from the indignity of being forgotten. Since it is clear that this Henry in fact represents to some degree the experiences of Yann Martel himself, a curious and not entirely displeasing duality comes into play.
Henry’s book is initially denied publication. According to Henry’s publishers, corporate bookstores would not know how to classify or market what Henry calls a “flip-book,” with a novel on one side and an essay on the other. The book, therefore, would be doomed from the start. So discouraged by this, Henry goes into a period of artistic withdrawal, in which he cannot bring himself to write. It almost seems that Martel is making a private joke, as he proceeds, in the rest of “Beatrice and Virgil” to accomplish what Henry fails to do.
Martel identifies Henry’s temporary loss of an authorial voice with that of the extinct animal and those of Holocaust victims. Martel also appears to take umbrage at the idea that the Holocaust must always remain a static concept. According to Henry, first-hand accounts of past suffering cannot accomplish the same emotional and intellectual challenge that a piece of fiction can. Martel’s book is therefore a revolutionary move written in protest against the reluctance to portray the Holocaust outside of non-fiction. Yet a simple look at the corpus of contemporary Western literature shows that the Holocaust has made its way into fiction.
In both “The Life of Pi” and “Beatrice and Virgil,” it becomes evident that Martel is most comfortable with expressing himself through the voice of anthropomorphized animals. Although he insists that his animal protagonists are irrevocably non-human, in some ways his animal characters are more nuanced than the human ones. In “Beatrice and Virgil,” the animals are the hapless heroes, while the humans prove to be cold-blooded and vicious.
Eerily however, the majority of the animal figures in “Beatrice and Virgil” are dead. Martel refers often to the sound of an ancient tape recording of howler monkeys in the upper reaches of the Amazon, transforming this rather odd sound into a hauntingly beautiful melody. Moreover, the two eponymous heroes of the book, are a taxidermied donkey and howler monkey, their lively dialogues pure fantasy. Martel refers repeatedly to the image of taxidermied animals standing in a bestiary-like taxidermy shop, poised as if to move. Like the tape recording of the howler monkeys, the taxidermied animals are just a chilling memory of themselves, the consummate memento mori.
The title, “Beatrice and Virgil” refers to Dante’s sublime and venal guides through Paradise and Hell in the “Divine Comedy.” Martel evidently hopes to draw a parallel between Dante’s experiences in the afterlife with the sometimes-agonizing human experience of life on Earth. Beyond that obvious reference, “Beatrice and Virgil” is full of literary allusions. Martel borrows heavily from the mood of manic stasis in Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot,” and as Henry himself notes, his “flip-book” would have two doors, “but no exit.” This conceit is reminiscent of the hellish, locked claustrophobia of Sartre’s “Huis Clos.”
There is indeed no exit from “Beatrice and Virgil,” not even when the book culminates in its final moment of overwhelming crescendo, as Martel’s characters find themselves trapped in an eruption of hell-like flames. Like the echoing themes of a fugue, all the components of the Martel’s novel fit tightly together, leading up to one ultimate moment of terror.

“One of the things / he believed was that our poems could be better / than our motives. So who cares why / he wrote those lines about the hairstyle / of his piano teacher in Wilno in the 1920s / or the building with spumy baroque cornices / that collapsed on her in 1942,” poet Robert Hass writes in one of his latest sequences of poems, “July Notebook: The Birds.” In his newest collection, “The Apple Trees at Olema,” Hass’s poetry and motives seem to be entirely in sync. His careful observations of the world around him show a mind aiming to portray the most beautiful aspects of life.
This latest collection of new and selected poems provides an opportunity to take a retrospective look at his greatest works—recipients of decorations from the National Book Award to the Pulitzer Prize—from the past few decades. The book gathers Hass’s first five collections of poetry—“Field Guides,” “Praise,” “Human Wishes,” “Sun Under Wood,”  and “Time and Materials,” and also includes a modest 40-page collection of brand new poems.
Hass’s poetry remains as accomplished as ever. Like much of Hass’s previous work, the new poems included in “The Apple Trees at Olema” are devoted to the nuances of day-to-day life. The section of new work includes three poetic suites that are entitled “July Notebook: The Birds,” “August Notebook: A Death,” and “September Notebook: Stories.” It is as though Hass were a keen, observant scientist, jotting down the results of his studies in his personal notebooks. His focus shifts back and forth from the specific details of nature to the personal narratives of characters in his poems.
When he details the mechanisms of the natural world, Hass attempts to draw connections between nature and the world of human emotion. In the poem “Variations on a Passage in Edward Abbey” Hass opens by precisely describing the formation of a dune: “twenty to twenty-five degrees from the horizontal. On the leeward side / the slope is much steeper, usually about thirty-four degrees....”
As the poem continues, Hass widens the scope of his lens.  The dune moves, he writes, in a “grand slow march / across the earth’s surface,” which “has an external counterpart in the scouring / movement of glaciers.” As he explores the layers of fractals in nature, the poet sees similar shapes and motion in the patterns of human feelings. He notices “The movement of grief / which has something in it of the desert’s bareness / and of its distances.”
Although most of the new poems in “The Apple Trees at Olema,” are more or less narratives, Hass’s eye for detail in his portrayals of human relationships is just as keen as in his more scientifically based descriptions of nature. “Some of David’s Story” tells the account of a man named David as he falls in and out of love with his former lover. By specifying the name of this character and by including details throughout the poem, such as the specific kind of wines David discusses with his lover’s father, Hass brings to life what might otherwise be a somewhat mundane love story.
The poet manages to represent the dialogue between David and the woman he loves with similar precision: “at the party, she said, / ‘I have an English father and an American mother.../ and at some point I had to choose, so I moved back to London and became the sort of person / who says puh-son instead of purr-son.” Hass carefully details the small stories of each of the characters who appear throughout his poems. This ability to create a convincing narrative seems to be, according to Hass, important for poets. After all, in “August Notebooks: A Death,” he claims that “the most reliable stories... are the ones the poets tell.”
Although Hass’s section of new poems does not seem as polished and schematized as the segments selected from his previous collections, its slightly rougher quality helps the poet present his work as if he were giving his reader a privileged view into his private journals.  The new poems of “The Apple Trees at Olema” show that Robert Hass continues to write verse that approaches both the natural and the human world with a close, scientific eye. This new collection is a celebration of the beauty he finds in the order of both human and non-human life.

In mid-February, “The Ricky Gervais Show” premiered to little fanfare on HBO. It has only three characters, all of whom are animated—one is British comedian Ricky Gervais and another is his long-time collaborator Stephen Merchant. The third is a man named Karl Pilkington, whose brain is different from yours and mine.
Despite the show’s title, Gervais is hardly its focus. Instead, it is Karl, whom—despite his utter lack of stand-up, writing, or acting experience—Gervais has called “the funniest man alive in Britain today.” Over the last decade, Pilkington has become Gervais’s pet project, if not his pet. He is a fool, and also a genius.
Karl’s brilliance is a blend of questionable social theories (the elderly never eat Twix bars, and Chinese people age more quickly than any other race), erroneously recounted news stories he read on the Internet, neologisms (“foodage,” for example, and “squoze”—Karl’s past tense conjugation of “squeeze”), and Yogi Berra-esque aphorisms.
It’s difficult to convey how funny this is. A reliably fruitful gag consists of Ricky and Steve asking Karl to explain proverbs. For instance, Karl’s interpretation of the saying “Those who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones” is this: “If you live in a glass house, don’t be chucking stuff about.” It’s not that he just says things that make no sense—there’s an atom of plausibility to the inanity, which implicates the listener in every ridiculous convolution of his thought process. On average, any sentence out of Karl’s mouth is more amusing than the cumulative value of most twenty-two minute sitcoms.
Gervais and Merchant’s acquaintance with Pilkington is the comedic equivalent of the discovery of penicillin. Before the success of “The Office,” the two had co-presented a radio show on Xfm London. Upon their return to the station in 2001, they were serendipitously assigned Pilkington as their producer. Little by little, Gervais and Merchant realized the volume of the wondrous iceberg of Karl’s weirdness, and his airtime steadily increased.
Since then, their collaboration has resurfaced in confusingly myriad forms, but suffice to say that I have over 60 non-repetitive hours of Gervais-Merchant-Pilkington audio downloaded on my computer. (This, admittedly, may be more a demonstration of my own nerdiness than anything else.) Their most recent release is a series of 10 one-hour “The Ricky Gervais Guide To...” episodes, with installments ranging in subject matter from “The Arts” to “The Future.”
When Karl isn’t actively spouting drivel, Ricky and Steve still have plenty to mock him for, including his Mancunian monotone and remarkably spherical bald head (like “a fucking orange,” Gervais frequently claims). A 2006 New York Times article claimed that Pilkington was a master of “comic deadpan”—indeed, the humor derived from Karl’s way of thinking is so exquisitely consistent that it can be hard to believe it’s organic.
In the U.K., Karl Pilkington has a cult following of Jonestownian proportions, which he has wisely parlayed into three book deals and a multitude of hosting gigs. He, Gervais, and Merchant were even awarded the Guinness World Record for the most downloaded podcast in 2006. But this tremendous popularity has yet to make its way across the Atlantic.
This is where HBO comes in. The new TV series recycles audio from the early series of the podcast, setting it to animation of the three men chatting within a recording studio and cartoon vignettes that demonstrate whatever madness Karl happens to be espousing at the moment.
To some extent, the hilariously disparate body types of Gervais, Merchant, and Pilkington lend themselves to caricature. They are a strange tableau: the lumbering six-foot-seven Merchant, the squat Gervais, the round-headed Pilkington. Most reviews liken Gervais’s avatar to Fred Flintstone, but I believe the real similarity here is to Comedy Central’s mercifully short-lived “Shorties Watchin’ Shorties” (you know a show’s good when its title prescriptively drops the gerund “g”), which animated clips of stand-up comedy routines. That’s not the greatest of legacies.
Overall, I think, the animation only distracts us from Karl’s surreal, systematically incorrect worldview. The comedy of the podcasts is minimalist and mean-spirited; Pilkington requires neither bells nor whistles. Regardless, TV’s “The Ricky Gervais Show” has been renewed for a second season—and despite its issues, I’m delighted. The format in which Karl is presented is almost beside the point, so long as Karl is presented.
After the overwhelming—and overwhelmingly deserved—success of “The Office” and “Extras,” both co-created with Merchant, I can’t imagine Gervais is looking to make a quick buck. He believes in “The Ricky Gervais Show,” because he believes that the world needs to meet Karl Pilkington and probe his brain. And it does—my own fanaticism stops just short of distributing religious tracts honoring Karl in the Times Square subway station. If a spoonful of TV sugar is necessary to make this medicine go down, then so be it.

In a world of periodic tables and algorithms, it’s easy to forget how to let the creative juices flow.
“I find the scientists I work with to be very creative people,” says Brian Knep, an associate and the artist-in-residence at the Systems Biology department in the Harvard Medical School (HMS). “What I find kind of sad is that a lot of the science world feels very constrained in a way that’s not very good for inspiration in general.”
With an obligation to address this concern in mind, Knep has been inviting local artists on a monthly basis to come discuss their work with the various scientists, chemists, and engineers on the medical school campus. By organizing these talks, Knep says he hopes to encourage the explorative and imaginative nature of science that is often subdued by the demands of hard data, precision, and controlled objectivity.
“For instance, you meet somebody who has been spending the last three years trying to find if a protein folds this way or that way,” Knep says. “And after a while they figure it out and publish it—but all the wonder and excitement has been sucked out of them.”
Knep points to the prevalence of capitalist culture in the American education system, among other societal institutions, as a limitation that is ideal for progress and innovation but not so much for the personal task of exploring the art in each of us.
“We learn science like it’s a done deal,” Knep says. “You learn the rules and what’s happened, but don’t really learn it as something that’s still happening. We need to learn how to be a maker, how to be a creator.”
Yet all hope is not lost for the hard sciences. Instead, Knep has observed intriguing and impressive conversations arising from these collaborations between scientists and artists, whose presentations deal with topics ranging from the discussion of political issues to social aspects of each work and how it ties in to science. As myriad questions and observations are thrown about in this open forum, he compares the experience to actually witnessing the minds of the audience open up.
“There’s a bit of timidity since the standards that hold art are different from science,” Knep says. “Sometimes they don’t know what questions to ask. But I often hear the comment ‘I wish I could do that,’—or rather, they wish they could explore it in that way.”
Trained as a computer scientist and mathematician, Knep can relate to the scientific perspective and use that background in his role as a new media artist. Using modern tools of science and technology, which he once worked with in the special effects industry, Knep appropriates universal themes of change, healing, struggle, and acceptance to address the impact of science on our lives.
“As a kid, my parents took me to art museums a lot in New York City,” he says. “I had a deep appreciation, but I had always seen it as something that was done by masters. It was untouchable, not something I could do.”
But it was not until he took the leap into the unknown of the art world that Knep recognized firsthand the value and effect of art. With this personal revelation, he decided to dedicate himself to sharing that experience with his HMS colleagues.
As Knep advises, “You need to be creative in order to have innovation in any field, and the arts is a way to exercise that part of your brain.”
Although practicing the arts helps to round out an individual, Knep says he is also frustrated that art only gains serious acknowledgement through this subordinate role. In using art as an enhancer for other aspects of life, instead of as a legitimate endeavor in its own right, we begin to lose the value of artistic creation itself, he warns.
“People are always thinking ‘How can art help the economy?’ or ‘How can art help innovation in my field?’ It’s constantly getting lost in public policy conversation,” Knep says. “Art for arts sake is a way to open your mind to explore the darkness that might not be so dark.”
In sharing the fruits of artistic labor with the science world, Knep is working to advance artistic expression in today’s society. While artistic creativity and scientific objectivity may appear to be mutually exclusive domains, Knep believes that nobody should be confined to just one way of seeing things.
“There are different kinds of minds, and they are all valuable in the arts and the sciences,” he says.

Perched atop a ladder, his hardhat glinting under the spotlight, steel worker Mike Dillard (Michael A. Barron ’11) confesses, “Non-recognition by other people, it bothers you sometimes.” The steelworker’s powerful monologue is the first of many in “Working: The Musical,” written by Stephen Schwartz—the composer of “Wicked” and “Godspell”—and various other artists.
Based on the book “Working” by Studs Terkel, the musical captures the reflections of 26 very different American workers—all of whom eloquently express insecurities, dreams deferred, and a search for identity beyond job titles. Under the inventive direction of Brandon J. Ortiz ’12, “Working” combines imaginative technical elements with realistic portrayals of laborers and their poignant songs, illuminating an often-forgotten facet of American life.
“Working”—which runs through April 10—fits well in the modest Loeb Experimental Theater venue. The musical makes creative use of the entire space: workers hammer against the metal grid overhead in the percussive opening and perform monologues from the theater’s wrap-around balconies.
Even the band members—adorned by costume designer Meryl F. Natow ’13 in hard hats and flannel shirts—play in raised cubicles. The small space does not inhibit the actors, but instead allows them to interact closely with the audience, making their characters seem all the more human and believable.
Stark lighting accentuates the confessions of the workers against the minimalist but functional set, pushing actors to intimately reveal their hardships in a way that elaborate stagecraft might have inhibited. Ortiz’s resourceful use of the space and careful showcasing of his actors’ talents help to maintain a swift pace throughout the production, as he unwaveringly focuses on the laborers’ struggles. Especially considering this is his first directorial effort, Ortiz exhibits confidence and ease in his work.
The choreography—by Ryan P. Halprin ’12—also reflects the creative use of the stage. A musical number that takes place in a supermarket, “I’m Just Movin’,” highlights this careful attention to detail. Grocery checker Babe Secoli (Nicole I. Torres ’11) explains her repetitive work, demonstrating the “hips, hand, and register” technique as she handles groceries. Suddenly, each mundane movement begins to fall into rhythm until her work transforms into a dance, with groceries flying flawlessly across the stage from cart to bag.
Though “I’m Just Movin’” is lighthearted, the number segues into weighty issues. Grocery bagger Roberto Nuñez (Joe J. Vitti ’10) reminisces on his life as an immigrant child, picking the crops that “ended up in that fine salad” of his complaining customer. His Spanish musical number “Un Mejor Dia Vendra” portrays Nuñez’s struggle with American identity honestly and sensitively.
“Just a Housewife”—one of the most engaging and effective musical numbers in the production—tells the story of housewife Kate Rushton (charmingly portrayed by Annie J. Mitran ’13). Mitran plays Kate with a moving vocal performance. Shameful of the stereotypes of the housewife, Mitran says, “All I am is someone’s mother; all I am is someone’s wife.” Despite the judgment of others over her lack of a career, Mitran ends her song with pride, declaring, “What I choose to do may be dumb to you, but not to me.”
Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’11 gives a particularly unique performance in the musical number “Brother Trucker.” Slouched in her imaginary big rig, Chainey reflects on the open road with a sharp sense of humor.
The band’s jazzy accompaniment of Chainey’s soulful voice adds a funk that brings forth her sassy truck driver attitude. Conducted by Mark R. Parker ’12, the band does not overpower, but instead complements the vocal performances.
Chainey ends her drive at a café, introducing a waitress with real flair: Dolores Dante (Kyla N. Haggerty ’13). In “It’s an Art,” Haggerty sings, “Waitressing is like performing; it’s intoxicating,” as she dances with flourish from customer to customer. Haggerty shows that performers work on the most unexpected of stages, even with trays of food in hand.
The cast of “Working” fittingly pays tribute to one of its production sponsors, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. In “Cleaning Woman,” the actresses are donned in crimson smocks displaying the Harvard Facilities Maintenance Operations seal. Led by maid Maggie Holmes (Paige E. Martin ’11), “Cleaning Woman” presents an optimism lacking in earlier monologues as Martin sings of her hopes for her daughter and the future of a whole new generation.
The intertwined lives of the characters unite in the final number, “Something to Point To,” as the workers band together in their desire for recognition. They celebrate the neighbor who can never quite pay the bills, the janitor who stays in the office long after the boss leaves, and the workers who are never recognized for their labor but keep the country running each day. For their stark depiction of humanity, the cast and staff of “Working” deserve praise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Every step counts in popularizing jazz,” Aryeh Gold-Parker ’12—a member of the Harvard Jazz Band— said in an email.
On April 10, Harvard will contribute to promoting the genre by honoring saxophonist-composer James Moody—best known for the composition “Moody’s Mood for Love”—in recognition for a lifetime of creative achievements.
In an effort to bring more of a jazz presence to Harvard’s campus, the Office for the Arts’ (OFA) Harvard Jazz Program and the Harvard Jazz Bands will organize a tribute concert for James Moody, the saxophonist who was recently named the 2010 Harvard University Jazz Master in Residence. Moody’s broad scope of works, both old and new, will be the focus of the event “Moody’s Moods: The Music of James Moody” in Sanders Theater.
“Moody has become known as a great entertainer. He invites [the audience] into what he does. He enjoys what he does. Like his mentor Dizzy Gillespie, he puts people at ease,” says Thomas G. Everett, director of the Harvard University Band.
Although Moody will not be in attendance at the tribute concert while he recovers from his recent gall bladder surgery, his contemporary Jimmy Heath, who has played with other notable jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane, will be performing in Moody’s place and accepting the honor on his behalf.
Heath will perform a new arrangement of Moody’s 2005 composition “Moody’s Groove,” which was commissioned for the concert by the Harvard Jazz Bands. Along with Heath, saxophonist Bill Pierce from the Berklee College of Music will also be featured at the concert.
Among the reasons for choosing Moody for this recognition, Everett explains, was the musician’s innovation and influence in the jazz style of Bebop in the late 1940s, his musicianship with the flute as well as the tenor and alto saxophone, and his love for the music he creates. In addition, Moody is able to make his music accessible, while never abandoning his personal style.
“One of the unfortunate things about jazz is that either someone is revered in the jazz community as a great artist and the music isn’t appreciated by the masses because it’s difficult to listen to… or the music is very popular, and often has less content, has less artistic integrity,” Everett says. “Somehow he’s been able to do both.”
Starting in the late 1940s, Moody began playing with jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie’s band and continued for several years. His first big hit came with the 1949 song “Moody’s Mood for Love,” on which he played an improvised saxophone solo based on Jimmy McHugh’s “I’m in the Mood For Love.”
Although he exhibited some of the elements of the influential Charlie Parker, the composition was all Moody’s own. In the early 1950s, jazz singer Eddie Jefferson wrote lyrics to the solo, which Moody himself oftentimes sings in live performances.
While he moved to Europe during the mid-century to escape racial prejudices against African Americans, he continued to work throughout this time, and “Moody’s Mood for Love” increased in popularity with jazz vocalist King Pleasure’s own 1954 rendition, Everett says.
“Moody’s Mood for Love” has still managed to retain its popularity, as artists ranging from Van Morrison to Queen Latifah, from Aretha Franklin to Amy Winehouse have recorded their own versions. This iconic piece will be one of Moody’s signature works showcased at the tribute concert.
In anticipation of the concert, the jazz band has been working to prepare the musician’s compositions that span the different moments of his career, including lesser known pieces from the Moody canon, such as “Phil Up.”
“For some, James Moody may not be a household name. I think for the younger generation, they just don’t know,” OFA program manager Thomas Lee says.
But Lee states that the upcoming tribute concert and the position of Jazz Master is given to honor the artist and increase public awareness of his music.
Gold-Parker, who will be playing in the concert, echoed Lee’s sentiments in an email: “I’m pretty excited for Yardfest, but it bothers me that most students get really excited for contemporary stars like Kid Cudi but miss the fact that jazz artists like Jimmy Heath have had an immeasurably larger impact on American music,” he says. “I hope that the OFA can advertise the show in a way that gets students excited.”
And with jazz playing an integral role in the process of American cultural development, Everett believes that the appreciation of the work of a jazz musician like Moody will provide for a deeper understanding of America’s past.
“If someone studies the history of jazz in this country, they’re actually getting a mini cross discipline into economics, culture, social landmarks, milestones; they’re dealing with the racisms in this country; they’re dealing with the politics of popular music,” Everett says.

To insult a girl in the style of the French revolutionaries, calling her “a stained bordello bed sheet”—as stage prompter Simon does to one of his conquests—might do the trick. Memorable lines like this one hint at the sex and violence of “Danton’s Death,” the Georg Büchner drama which runs on the Loeb Mainstage through April 10. Set during the Reign of Terror, the play follows the downfall of Jacobin leader Georges Danton (Benjamin T. Clark ’09), who becomes disenchanted with the Revolutionary Government and is subsequently sent to the guillotine by the power-hungry Maximilien Robespierre (Felix L. J. Cook ’13). The show—though bolstered by a number of solid performances—is ultimately a disappointment, as it suffers from poor pacing, repetitive dialogue, incongruous technical elements, and a downright painful running time.
The play—directed by James M. Leaf ’10—opens with the bloodthirsty enthusiasm characteristic of the early days of the French Revolution. “Only cowards die for the Republic,” Danton thunders to a crowd of eager peasants. “Jacobins kill for it!” This violent passion in Danton’s early days finds a corollary in his sexual appetite. An unabashed patron of whorehouses, the Revolutionary leader immerses himself fully in the sensual pleasures of life, even cheekily noting, “What a bore it is to have to put on pants each day,” as he zips up his trousers from yet another illicit romp.
Eventually, however, Danton grows disillusioned with his decadent lifestyle, halfheartedly declaring, “We didn’t make the Revolution—the Revolution made us.” Originally a haphazardly charismatic character, Danton grows embittered when his initial quests for pleasure through women and wine start to feel like the listless idles of a cynic. Even in his final hours, Danton proves remotely unmoved by his impending demise; he reflectively admits one dark night, “I am merely flirting with death—it’s all empty noise, bravado.” Clark portrays this shift in Danton’s character effectively; his natural stage presence allows him to convincingly convey both freewheeling enthusiasm and downtrodden despair.
Unfortunately for Danton, this newfound disillusionment proves deadly, as the infamous Robespierre refuses to stand for his political and ideological subversion. Easily the most chilling presence on stage, Cook is the picture of abstemiousness—his severely prim, impeccably polished demeanor matched by his trimly-tailored gray suit. His carefully reasoned and perfectly elocuted speeches to the peasants are punctuated with raucous cries of agreement, which make many of his scenes evoke the structure of a preacher’s call-and-response sermon.
As for the rest of the cast, a few notable performances stand out. The prostitutes Rosalie (Candice C. Smith ‘11) and Adelaide (Victoria J. Crutchfield ’10) are especially skilled in physical acting—their swaying, sipping, and shimmying visually convey a breezy sexuality. In a completely different vein, Adriana I. Colón ‘12 is smart, snappy, and sharply-dressed in her portrayal of Louis de Saint-Just, creating a commanding on-stage presence which complements Robespierre’s own severity.
Despite these generally strong performances, the show is much too long, and the plot drags heavily in the middle. Suffering from surfeit scene changes and repetitive, pedantic monologues on life, sex, morality, and meaning, the show’s pacing quickly becomes bogged down in the mire of political and philosophical musings. The action also becomes unnecessarily convoluted in the middle acts, with the confusing web of deception and devious plotting further detracting from the play’s potential dramatic effect. At two hours, the show feels wearying; at almost three, it borders on insufferable.
Musically, the production makes occasional use of the vocal talents of Stewart N. Kramer ’12, whose powerful voice opens the show with a rousing, half-drunk chorus of “Vive la Compagnie.” He also briefly appears as a sage street performer singing for his supper. For its many scene transitions, the show too-frequently utilizes the Johnny Cash song “God’s Gonna Cut You Down,” a catchy, yet repetitive tune which rather abruptly jerks the listener out of eighteenth-century France and into the bluesy world of the American South.
Also jarring is the show’s set, designed by Todd Weekley. A mishmash of wooden furniture, the piles of chairs, tables, and desks strewn about the stage evoke nothing of Revolutionary France, but instead resemble the Dorm Crew storage closet. The most successful props are a few large wooden tumbrels, which provide a versatile playground for the actors as they use the handsome carts to labor, seduce, and persecute. As a perfunctory nod to the French national motto, “liberté,” “égalité,” and “fraternité” are scrawled graffiti-like in blood-red paint on banners which loom in the rafters high above the stage.
In terms of other technical elements, it is clear that the aesthetic guiding much of the costuming—by Elyssa Jakim ’10—draws straight from the 1980 musical “Les Misérables,” particularly in the case of the peasants. The actors are mostly clad in shabby fringed shawls, diaphanous white blouses, snug black corsets, and long, full skirts. Danton’s attire, however, is decidedly anachronistic, for he shambles about like a lazy grad student in untucked button-down and dark-wash jeans.
Ultimately, the show’s oppressive length, tedious scene changes, and convoluted philosophizing obfuscate the majority of its positive elements, which are primarily found in the actors. Perhaps most frustratingly, the production takes what could have been a compelling period epic and spoils it with sluggish direction. The show’s many detriments—coupled with a muddled, slow-moving plot—cause “Danton’s Death” to lose the thrill and excitement that its decidedly dramatic premise could have produced.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Media scenography,” a term coined by Heide Hagebölling, is the union of two classical Greek root words. Hagebölling, who gave a lecture—“Media Scenography: Creative Approaches in Intermedia and Public Art”—at the Carpenter Center last Thursday evening, is a professor at the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, Germany. “‘Sceno,’” she explained, “is the architectural aspect of the ancient Greek theatre, or the mise en scene of a film or play.” “‘Graphy,’” she continued, “means virtuosity, or the skill of descriptive, pictorial art.” The term, however, does not simply describe virtuoso set design. Media scenography labels an entirely new fusion of visual and auditory creation that reaches far beyond the classical theatre into modern performance spaces. It is, in its own way, a form of “multimedia storytelling,” according to Hagebölling.
The Academy of Media Arts, which she co-founded in 1988, has established a unique curriculum. Whereas elsewhere visual art fields are largely taught separately, the Academy advocates the integrated teaching of film, television, art, design, and theory. After studying at the Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach, the Annenberg School of Communication, and the Tisch School of the Arts, Hagebölling decided to synthesize these media into one field of study: Audiovisual Media. “Light, kinetics, space, performance, energy—these are the roots of the work we are doing at the Academy,” Hagebölling said.
According to Hagebölling, the goal of the Academy is to create installations that allow “collaborative work with musicians, dancers, and museums.” She clarified the interdisciplinary work of the Academy with photographs and videos of installations that have emerged from the  school.
The first project that Hagebölling presented was “Percussive Planet,” a collaboration with musician Martin Grubingers in Bonn that combined live digital animation with the pieces of 35 classical and contemporary composers. Grubinger’s musicians played together on stage against a backdrop of flashing animation created by VJ software, the same kind used in today’s nightclubs and bars. Enormous multi-colored shapes and lines streamed across the screen, all created in real-time by Hagebölling’s students as a visual response to Grubingers’ musical selections. The mood created by these animations was explosive—the popping lights of the final piece transported the viewers from the concert hall to the heart of a dance club.
Hagebölling next presented “Roll Over Beethoven,” an array of installations made for the Bonn International Beethoven Festival in 2006. The piece, Hagebölling said, “aimed to meaningfully translate classical music” through use of audiovisual media.
Eva Kehl-Cremers’s “Architektique” was an enormous spiraling cylindrical structure that hung from the gallery ceiling. The structure served as a canvas for her light animation and enveloped her viewers, who stood in the spiral, in an “audio-visual” experience. Animated waves of light oscillated up and down the spiral, as if choreographed to the sound of Beethoven’s Pathétique Sonata for piano. Although more traditional listeners may have cringed at this reinterpretation of one of Beethoven’s most famed works, Hagebölling said that her goal was to “give listeners a totally new experience… to allow viewers to understand the music on a different level.”
”Roll Over Beethoven” also featured Kualshen Auson’s whimsical installation, “Scratching Beethoven.” Auson’s project harnessed the movement of ant colonies through a network of glass boxes to mechanically rotate a turntable playing Beethoven’s opera “Fidelio.” “The dissonant sound horrified Beethoven-lovers,” Hagebölling laughed, “but it amused the children.”
Hagebölling then exhibited the projects she directed with Andreas Marat, who leads the Water Museum Mülheim in Cologne. They involved a series of installations housed inside the gallery space of a large water tower-turned-museum. One installation measured the magnetic field surrounding visitors who entered the space, which in turn caused glowing water to flow across a large disk on the gallery floor.
Hagebölling ended her lecture with an ethereal film of European ballet dancers dancing underwater, captured to music composed by the filmmaker.
Praising the student creators of the evening’s installations, Hagebölling said, “Media scenography is exciting for young people today because of the openness of the field and the new technological developments in media... We are constantly looking back to see what we can learn and what we can expand, but it is also important to change our attitudes and styles.”

Britney Spears may have found a new love for math and counting in her popular song “3,” but the U.S. Census Bureau has long loved counting and is doing it yet again as part of the 2010 Census’s count of Americans—and we're getting in on the action.
Tomorrow morning's copy of The Crimson has a series of articles on the U.S. Census. We're taking a look at what professors predict the Census will show about demographic shifts in America as well as what the Census Bureau and Harvard students are doing to reach out to students to make sure everyone is counted.
What do you have to do to be counted? All students should have been given a Census form in their campus mailboxes earlier this week or will receive one soon. Students need to fill out the form and then turn it into their Building Manager’s Office during business hours. Freshmen can turn the form into Yard Operations in the basement of Weld at any time of the day.
The forms are due on Tuesday, April 13.
Are you a cynical Harvard student and going to ask why you should do it? Because it is only seven questions long for students and because it is the primary way governments know how to distribute services and how Washington distributes over $400 billion in federal money. Funding for everything from the roads to the buses to law enforcement is affected by the Census, and if you don’t participate, less money comes to the Harvard area.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (4-6, 1-3 Ivy) landed in Charlottesville, VA following a Saturday road trip across New England and an Easter spent flying 500 miles south of Cambridge, the team was greeted with one if its toughest challenges of the season—a matchup with No. 5 Virginia (10-3, 3-1 ACC).
And for the game’s opening half, it looked like the Crimson was ready to knock off its second ranked opponent of the season.
But after building a 7-6 lead, things quickly unraveled for the underdog Harvard team, as the Crimson failed to maintain its momentum falling, 14-9, last night at Klockner Stadium.
“I think first half we came out and we played the sort of game that we’ve been trying to play this entire season,” freshman Danielle Tetreault said.
Harvard jumped out to an early lead, scoring less than five minutes into the contest courtesy of an unassisted score from freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen to take the 1-0 lead.
But the Cavaliers responded quickly, rattling off three straight scores in less than two minutes thanks to costly turnovers and fouls from the Crimson.
Harvard maintained its composure, knotting the contest at three after sophomore Melanie Baskind and Tetreault finished at the net.
The Crimson took the lead with 10:25 left in the first period when Tetreault found Baskind for the score to give Harvard the 5-4 advantage.
The midfielder netted her third goal of the contest three minutes later to put her team up 7-6, but that was the last time the visitors held the lead.
Virginia held Harvard scoreless over the final 7:16 of the half and took the lead for good off a score from Caity Whiteley just 27 seconds before the break.
After squandering its first half lead, the Crimson managed to claw back into the game early in the second. Freshman Nina Kucharczyk chose a good time to net her first collegiate score, capitalizing off a Cavaliers turnover to end a 3-0 Virginia run and put her team within one, 9-8.
“Nina has a lot of speed,” Tetreault said. “She got the ball and took it right down to the net and scored.”
But before the visitors could get another look at the cage to tie the game up, the Cavaliers struck again, using a free position shot to put their lead back at two. Virginia extended its lead to three on the next possession when Brittany Kalkstein finished a free position shot, as the Cavaliers led 11-8 with 22:14 remaining.
Harvard’s Tyler Petropulos answered 36 seconds later off an assist from co-captain Sara Flood, but a 21:38 scoring drought—a drought that featured six missed shots, three free position attempts, and three turnovers—doomed the Crimson.
“I think at the game we had a few missed opportunities that were just us not moving the goalie as much and that hurt us,” Tetreault said. “We hit [Lauren Benner] a few times when we needed to put it away.”
With 10:28 remaining Harvard had an opportunity to swing momentum back to its side, gaining possession down by two scores following a Virginia miss.
Freshman Micaela Cyr looked to get things started but her shot was blocked. Seconds later, Baskind swooped in to pick up the ground ball, saving the possession for the Crimson. With the fresh possession, Harvard got the ball to VanderMeulen. The freshman got enough space to get a look at the cage but her shot sailed wide.
Following a Crimson turnover, the Cavaliers controlled the ball with less than five minutes remaining up by two scores.
Things unraveled quickly for Harvard from there.
Needing to win back possession, the Crimson defense tried to force a turnover but was whistled for a foul, setting up Charlie Finnigan for the free position shot.
Finnigan found the back of the net, putting her team ahead 12-9 with just over three minutes left.
The Cavaliers iced it on the next possession, winning the draw control and then scoring off another free position shot to go up four.
Just nine seconds later, Virginia’s Julie Gardner managed to notch her team’s third score in 59 seconds, and the Cavaliers cruised to the victory, 14-9.

Time after time the ball sailed his way, and with an emphatic swing Erik Kuld proved that he was finally ready to take over. The Harvard men’s volleyball co-captain began the season with big shoes to fill, looking to spearhead an offense that graduated prolific outside hitter Brady Weissbourd ’09, and after a week of leading the Crimson to two victories—and leading the squad in kills—Kuld appears to have found his stride.
“[Kuld] came in this year knowing that he would be asked to play a bigger role in the offense,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “As a senior he’s come in this year…and really pushed the team along in the best way possible.”
This push included turning a 0-11 start into a three-game conference winning streak that left the Crimson in second place in the Hay division at week’s end. Crucial to this stretch has been the stellar play of Harvard’s senior outside hitter, including a team-leading 20-kill performance against Emmanuel last Tuesday and an effort against Newbury on Thursday in which the standout led the squad in both kills (27) and digs (14).
Yet, according to Baise, beyond Kuld’s thunderous spikes and solid defense, it was the co-captain’s perseverance through the losing streak that kept the squad on track.
“[Kuld] is a leader and the team follows his example,” Baise said. “When we had lost a bunch of matches, his work ethic and confidence never wavered. He’s been a central part of this turnaround as much off the court as on it.”
“Leading by example is not sufficient anymore,” Kuld added. “When the team encounters adverse situations, it falls to the captains to lead the team through those difficult situations.”
But without question, Kuld’s dominant play has equaled his leadership skills. The 6’1” outside hitter’s offensive explosion this past week was not unprecedented, as Kuld has been a model of consistency in the past, appearing in every single set in his sophomore and junior years (130 in total). During those campaigns, Kuld finished in the team’s top three in kills per game as well as in the top 25 in the nation last season in service aces per game with 0.35.
“He plays every part of the game extremely well,” Baise said. “But also the thing you don’t see is how he practices. He’s extremely competitive…He never takes a point off, and that’s why he’s as good as he is—the mindset that he brings.”
But Kuld’s success in the spotlight was not guaranteed. As 2010 loomed, the co-captain knew he would have to step up his game.
“I remember talking to [Kuld] in September and he was already thinking ahead, putting extra work in the weight room and extra repetitions at practice,” Baise explained.
The added effort has paid off, as Kuld currently leads the Crimson in kills per game (4.02) by a healthy margin, while standing third in digs (92) and tied for fourth in service aces (11).
Those numbers will only continue to rise if the senior performs as he did in those crucial league contests against Emmanuel and Newbury. Kuld received 54 sets against the Nighthawks, accounting for nearly 41 percent of Harvard’s attempts and proving that he has finally assumed that central role in the Crimson attack.
“To hit so many [sets] and put them down, you have to be in tremendous shape,” Baise marveled. “[Kuld] has always been one of the hardest workers…and it’s all about the team for him, never about himself.”
With these team goals in mind, the co-captain will look to take his squad where he has already arrived—to the next level.
“My personal goal…is to keep contributing as best I can in any way I can to the team so that our team goal is reached,” Kuld said.
At 3-1 in league play, that goal is very much in sight. Harvard stands alone in second place with half of the Hay Division season ahead, and if the squad finishes the year with the same effort, it will guarantee itself a playoff berth for the second consecutive season under Baise.
With Kuld leading the way, both on the court and off it, the only thing left uncertain is how high the team can rise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the weather suddenly shifts from rainy misery to summer-like temperatures, few activities seem more appealing than sailing. The lovely forecast helped the Harvard sailing squad find success at three different venues this past weekend. The teams sent to the Dellenbaugh Women’s Intersectional Regatta, Southern New England Team Races, and the Mystic Lake Invitational/Central Series Three all attained top-six finishes, proving themselves worthy of competing among some the top programs in the nation.
DELLENBAUGH WOMEN’S INTERSECTIONAL REGATTA
In sports, home-field advantage is often perceived to be critical, but in the B-Division of the women’s regatta, it didn’t play a factor as the sailors from Boston took the top two spots while host school Brown came in third. Boston College propelled itself to a regatta victory after several first-place finishes. The other boat, which consisted of Harvard sailors Liz Powers and Marie Appel, didn’t achieve the top spot but still lead the Crimson to fifth place out of 18 teams. Powers, the women’s team captain, and Appel, a sophomore, rode two first-place and two second-place finishes in the B boat’s runner-up effort.
While the squad’s A Boat, consisting of sophomore Emily Lambert and clasmmate Alexandra Jumper, didn’t have the same success as the B boat, its ninth-place finish was good enough to send the women’s team to a top-five finish. Lambert and Jumper improved over the course of regatta, bouncing back from two 18th place finishes with consecutive second-place finishes. After slipping back to double digit places, the duo was able to taste second place once more as it rallied to finish in the top half of the A boats.
“We unfortunately had two really bad races on Saturday,” Lambert said. “We definitely improved on Sunday.”
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND TEAM RACES
At some point in life, everyone learns that it is important to find ways other than constantly complaining in order to find a solution to a problem. Apparently, that message didn’t make its way into the sailing world since 35 protests were filed over the course of Sunday’s Gold Fleet races at Connecticut College. But the Crimson was able to navigate its way through the chaos to post a satisfying 6-8 record in the Gold Fleet races, earning sixth place overall.
“I think we’re pretty happy with how we did,” captain Alan Palmer said. “Those are pretty much the best teams we’re going to see.”
In order to advance to Sunday’s Gold Fleet, Harvard first had to finish in the top four at Coast Guard Academy on Saturday, and it proved its mettle. The two-day competition was set up such that half the teams raced at Connecticut College while the other half simultaneously competed at Coast Guard Academy on Saturday. The top four finishers at each site would race the next day in the Gold Fleet at Connecticut College, while the other schools competed at the same time in the Silver Fleet at the Academy.
Given the intensity of team-racing and the skill level of the competitors, it was perhaps not particularly surprising that the day produced many protests.
“In team-racing, which is what the format was, there end up being a lot more protests,” Palmer said. “Some events will have on the water judges who will immediately make a call [but] they weren’t able to get enough judges…There were 50 potentially protestable situations…some ended up being irrelevant.”
For the Crimson, the chaotic environment provided a good platform for learning, as the three skippers, Palmer, junior John Stokes, and junior Colin Santangelo, were team-racing together for the first time.
“[Santangelo] really hadn’t team race, or maybe he had but not at the same level,” Palmer said. “He didn’t know as much but he was able to pull some stunt-like moves that caught teams by surprise.”
After all the races had finished, Harvard stood tied with Brown as both schools had 6-8 records, but in the end the Bears were able to take the victory through a tie breaker.
“The weekend was actually pretty good,” Palmer said. The captain insisted that strong racing occurred despite the prevalence of protests. “A lot of good races were decided on the water, not in the protest room.”
MYSTIC LAKE INVITATIONAL/CENTRAL SERIES THREE
In the official results of the Tufts-hosted regatta, conditions were described as perfect. The host school’s enthusiasm about the weather must have boosted its own performance as its three teams took first, third, and fifth respectively. But while the host school took home most of the honors, the Crimson was still able to sneak into the top five, taking fourth of the ten teams behind Tufts 1, Boston University, and Tufts 2.
It was a freshman affair for Harvard in the Mystic Lake Invitational, as three out of the Crimson’s four sailors were rookies. One of those three, Jason Michas, teamed up with the lone sophomore at the regatta, William White, to help the Crimson’s A boat to a sixth-place finish while freshmen Sam Millham and Alma Lafler took eighth place.

“We back / Reunite like The Wu.” This lyric, slotted into the middle of “Wu Massacre’s” first single, “Our Dreams,” sets the tone for this release by three of the Wu Tang Clan’s most well-known members: Method Man, Ghostface Killah, and Raekwon. However, this is no mere return to the 1990s Wu formula of steady beats and stripped down samples overlaid with brutally compelling raps. Instead the album represents a boldly dynamic approach to hip-hop.
“Our Dreams,” an at times hazy romantic rap ode featuring sampled vocals from Michael Jackson’s “We’re Almost There,” illustrates this musical progression perfectly, displaying a subtlety and refinement that distinguishes “Wu Massacre” from the mass of hip-hop currently circulating. The album still includes the typical clichés of misogyny, shameless bravado, and violent fantasy—it wouldn’t be a Wu release if it didn’t—but it manages to quite successfully navigate the fine line between aggressive and elegant. This culminates in a soulful, uplifting and rather smooth production that still manages to pack a brutal, knuckle-duster-wearing punch.
Quite simply, “Wu Massacre” manages to condense all that is most vitally raw and dynamic about this hip-hop trio into a snappy 30-minute album that blazes by in a flash of intensity and verve. The album bristles with intriguing musical touches. Opener “Criminology 2.5,” for instance, features a chorus heralded by resounding trumpet samples, soulful female vocals and trickling piano flourishes. This track propelled further forward by a punchy yet grooved drumbeat and the consistent lyrical vigor of Meth, Ghost, and Rae.
In this manner, the majority of the album’s tracks seem similarly polished and ebullient, with a steady resolve and undeniable infectiousness. Unfortunately, “Wu Massacre” as a whole lacks a sense of integration. It appears that almost no attention was paid to the track sequencing, and the songs proceed in a decidedly clunky manner. This is illustrative perhaps of a lack of attention to the overall feel of the album, which ends up seeming like a collection of great songs pushed thoughtlessly together. There is also perhaps a certain hastiness in the way in which “Wu Massacre” has been pushed out for public consumption. The last two songs clearly serve as appalling filler, and “Criminology 2.5” even features re-used Ghostface Killah raps rather than new material. Additionally, the album’s skits, such as the “How to Pay Rent Skit” featuring Tracy Morgan, are seemingly intended to be ironic interludes but end up as inane interruptions. Drafting in a large group of hip hop  production may have helped to produce much of the quality seen on each song. However, the general lack of attention to detail ultimately prevents “Wu Massacre” from being the incredible album it could and should be, rather than merely an impressive collection of songs.
These issues aside, the dominance and individual capabilities of each of these three artists is indisputable, and each of them is on top of their game on “Wu Massacre.” It is in a sense fitting that Marvel Comics artist Chris Bachalo designed the album cover for “Wu Massacre”, as it demonstrates perfectly the trio’s status as de facto superheroes in the world of hip-hop. Most importantly, it seems like they have managed to successfully fuse each of their three highly successful musical visions and their most irresistible elements. Combining the expert sampling of recent Ghostface Killah releases such as “Fishscale,” the classic vicious rap bite of Method Man, and the slick production skills and entrancing vocals of Raekwon, “Wu Massacre” delivers a hearty slice of outstanding rap. This release should leave members of the Wu Army suitably impressed, and shows that the spirit of its members is still as strong as ever.

On the penultimate track of her latest LP, “I Speak Because I Can,” British singer-songwriter Laura Marling issues a careful admonition to those who wish to grow up too quickly. “You deal with God far too young / Before you know it, your life has run away,” the sage 20-year-old cautions, seemingly wistful of her own life’s rapid passing. But after listening to Marling’s latest album, one may end up hoping that, in fact, her musical career has just begun. A gratifying sophomore release from the precocious folk-rock talent, “I Speak Because I Can” endows Marling’s characteristic elegance with a new intensity and an epic, almost theatrical, vigor.
Perhaps the most outstanding change Marling adds to her signature full-bodied vocals, melodic guitar, and poetic lyricism is the pronounced intensity which characterizes much of her new release. “Devil’s Spoke,” for example, opens the album with an impassioned interpretation of religious folk music. Slow, hypnotizing bass lines, deep male background vocals, and thumping drums endow a frantic banjo, as well as Marling’s voice and guitar, with a sheer power new to Marling’s work. And when she issues such commands as “Hold your devil by his spoke / And spin him to the ground,” Marling’s lyrics also prove to wield an impressive force. Such compelling arrangements have an energizing effect, and the track is a telling precursor to the other particularly invigorating songs on “I Speak Because I Can.”
Similarly, fifth track “Alpha Shallows” represents a new level of passion in Marling’s repertoire. The song begins tamely enough: at first, only a soft, yet urgent acoustic guitar and quiet, staccato strings support Marling’s voice as she sings such characteristically poetic lyrics as “And his heart was full of fire at the man he had become / And his soul was seldom higher with the falsities of fun.” But the song gradually intensifies, boasting, at its climax, full choral accompaniment, deep, forceful piano chords, and the dramatic rumble of orchestral percussion. With a switch to a major key near the end, the song’s brooding quality eventually gives way to a lighter tone, but its passion is maintained. The track ends on a truly epic note, as the full choir’s harmony and the percussion’s deep rumblings ascend to a point of almost religious fervor.
In a different vein, “I Speak Because I Can” also contains some less complex songs which represent Marling’s calmer side. The second track, “Made By Maid” is unique on the album in its simplicity. The track features only Marling’s vocals and guitar, and because of its spare quality, her gorgeous voice and poignant storytelling are able to stand out. The song testifies to Marling’s ability to tell tales well beyond the scope of the average 20-year-old, convincingly recounting the experience of a woman who “found a babe atop a log and all alone / Took him under, took him on.” “Made By Maid” provides a calming respite from the grandeur of the more intense numbers, and impresses with its unadorned elegance.
Still, the best tracks are the more dynamic ones. Wisely chosen as the album’s first single, “Rambling Man” is the most invigorating number on the record. As the track progresses, several layers of instrumentation pile on top of the initially bare, yet solid base of acoustic guitar strumming and vocals. The combination of these elements, which include cheerful banjo melodies, steadfast drums and electric guitar, lend the track a sense of robustness and complexity, and their effect is truly satisfying. Additionally, Marling’s vocals seem to achieve a rare level of abandon on “Rambling Man.” In the middle and final parts of the song when the instrumental elements reach their peak of volume and passion, Marling’s voice mirrors them by taking on a surprising strength, reaching alternately lower and higher than her usual range. Taken together, these features make for one of the best, strongest songs on an already exceptional album.
As Marling herself intimates on the album’s sixth track, “Goodbye England,” this young artist is gifted enough to become a permanent fixture, rather than some fleeting sensation, of the indie folk-rock scene: “I’m too good for that,” she sings, “there’s a mind under this hat.” And her sophomore release, “I Speak Because I Can,” only corroborates the fact. The new LP proves that Marling’s successful debut album, “Alas, I Cannot Swim,” was certainly not a fluke, and that her songwriting skill is the genuine article. “I Speak Because I Can” is an intense, dynamic, and admirable release from the young singer-songwriter, and merits her the sincerest recognition as an upcoming and formidable talent.

Listening to “Here Lies Love” means first coming to terms with the bizarre reality of this album: David Byrne, Fatboy Slim, and a host of guest singers narrating the rise and fall of Imelda Marcos, First Lady of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. It’s an alt-rock opera about a woman most well known for the appalling excess of her collection of 3,000 designer shoes. As if that weren’t bewildering enough, it fails to cover the most well-known events of its subject’s life; Byrne, the album’s storyteller, omits Marcos’s shoe collection, the infamous and probably staged attempt on her life, and similarly unflattering but heavily publicized episodes.
What’s left is a carefully composed narrative that’s difficult to follow on first listen but much clarified by the album’s liner notes, which read like a script. Byrne moves his heroine from impoverished, frustrated young love on “The Rose of Tacloban,” to confidence in her femininity on “Men Will Do Anything,” to a tragic realization that she has gone unappreciated on “Why Don’t You Love Me.” It’s a strong, sure-handed plot that moves as though Byrne is completely oblivious to the difficulty of sympathising with Marcos. For those who don’t know much about the protagonist, it’s a powerful story. For those with an even passing familiarity, though, the rose-tinted perspective of the lyrics seems rather surprising.
Luckily, the music—even closer to pure pop than Byrne’s Talking Heads work—is fantastic. Fatboy Slim brings a processed, electronic-tinged danceability to a collection that evokes the disco funk of New York’s Studio 54, where Marcos was famous for dancing with celebrities like Andy Warhol. Warhol is actually name-dropped on “Dancing Together,” which features a mix of crashing drums and a funky bass line that make it the album’s closest approximation to both disco and hip-hop.
Disco isn’t much of a stretch for Fatboy Slim’s dance music production style, but together Slim and Byrne explore an impressive range of genres. “A Perfect Hand” presents a guitar and piano simplicity that would be at home on a Bruce Springsteen album, with lyrics to match. Steve Earle, the only male vocalist on the album besides Byrne himself, growls, “There are many ways to win a game / And skill is not enough,” inviting the listener to imagine the pressure put on Marcos as a young woman striving for upward mobility in a society with no semblance of meritocracy.
The transition between “A Perfect Hand” and “Eleven Days” is proof enough of the duo’s versatility. Whereas “A Perfect Hand” is all simplicity and charm, “Eleven Days” delivers a syth-driven melody worthy of any pop superstar, and the vocals of Cyndi Lauper only accentuate this effect.
Lauper headlines a cast of female vocalists that present a compelling and sexy image of Marcos’ character. Florence Welch, lead vocalist of British indie act Florence and the Machine, establishes this feel in the title track opener, crooning, “When I am called by God above / Don’t have my name inscribed into the stone / Just say, ‘Here Lies Love.’”
Byrne and Slim quickly establish musical and thematic focus in this opener: its blend of processed dance rhythms and orchestral accents serve as a fair synopsis of the album’s sound, and the inspiration for the album’s title—Marcos’s asking that “Here Lies Love” be inscribed on her tombstone—is immediately explained.
For most of the sprawling 22-song album it feels like the difficulty of painting a sympathetic portrait of a woman who wants herself referred to as “Love” on her gravestone has been brushed over. But there are exceptions, moments in which Byrne chooses to face Marcos’s dark side: “Order 1081,” for example, describes the declaration of martial law enacted by her husband in 1972. Here Marcos’s character sings “Got to stop all this confusion / Got to wipe away the scar / And the way to make it happen / Order 1081,” complicating her naïveté with darkly enchanting strings that suggest her awareness and fear of a more sinister reality.
But the problem with “Here Lies Love” isn’t any lack of musical or lyrical complexity. If anything, Byrne and Fatboy Slim prove that they could make a fun, complex album—or, for that matter, a rock opera—on just about anything. The problem is that the near complete success of “Here Lies Love” only begs the question of why a more identifiable, emotionally compelling subject was not chosen. If Byrne set out to prove he could find the artful musicality in a seemingly distasteful figure, he has succeeded. But if he was aiming for emotional impact, he might have looked to a more sympathetic subject. But until Byrne decides to make “Here Lies Mother Teresa,” “Here Lies Love” will do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crouching is the only way to look through the six- by four-inch peep-hole into the giant wooden box on display in the Sert Gallery at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. The box is 20 feet by 10 feet and four and a half feet high—but only those 24 inches of surface area are transparent. The rest is plywood.
Through the peep-hole is a bizarre scene. Lit with a black light, the space inside is scattered with white contraptions made of wicker-like threads. The twisted objects vary in shape, but are all roughly the size of large Christmas ornaments. There is no ostensible rhyme or reason to their placement, and they glow in the black light with an odd iridescence. The world inside the box looks like the bottom of the sea shot through an underwater camera.
The exhibition, “If Organizing is the Answer, What’s the Question?” was created by Chilean artist Cristóbal Lehyt after he spent two years in the office of Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program exploring the history of labor and unionization in Massachusetts. The box, and a second piece—an abstract “calendar” of a year’s work that wraps around an entire wall of the gallery—both draw from that experience.
The run of Lehyt’s exhibition overlaps with a musical on campus also dedicated to labor. On April 2, first-time director Brandon J. Ortiz ’12 opened “Working”, a musical written by Stephen Schwartz and Nina Faso that celebrates workers ranging from a supermarket checker to a CEO.
Two more dissimilar pieces would be hard to come by. Lehyt’s sculpture is dark, heavy, exclusive, and his “calendar,”—with its 260 squares representing the 260 non-holiday and non-weekend days of the year—is not organized in a way comparable to any other calendar. Both of Lehyt’s pieces could be interpreted in various ways. In contrast, Ortiz’s show is blithe with song and dance and, at its core, inclusive—both of its audience and of the breadth of society the play encapsulates.
But through their different approaches, both works deal with the intersection of art and labor—“Working” by using art as a means for glorifying the worker and welcoming the viewer into the workers’ sphere, Lehyt’s sculpture by exploiting the ambiguity innate in abstract art as a means for proclaiming that labor is impossible to understand from the outside. And both “Working” and the sculpture throw into sharp relief the inability of art to embody labor, particularly on a campus where so few individuals are involved in the manual labor the pieces represent.
ORCHESTRATING UNDERSTANDING
Ortiz decided to direct “Working” because, as a child, he never understood his father’s experiences as a Mexican migrant worker in the U.S. But performing as the migrant worker in a high school production of “Working” gave him new insight into his dad’s everyday life.
“We can philosophize all day about social issues but… it’s just hard to imagine what life is like for people who have to do that type of backbreaking manual labor all day to survive,” Ortiz said. “So that’s why I thought it would be perfect to do ‘Working’ again here. I wanted to get this point across to students.”
In Ortiz’s opinion, students walk around all day with little regard for the staff members who make Harvard tick. To counteract audiences’ ignorance, Ortiz aimed to tie “Working” directly to Harvard itself. He approached Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers (HUCTW), and formed a partnership. The actors in “Working” now wear HUCTW uniforms, and HUCTW workers attended their final dress rehearsal.
“Working” makes its characters readily accessible. It thrusts them on stage for all to see and presents its agenda directly. There is little ambiguity; the intention of “Working” is to glorify the worker, and glorify it does.
The play’s grand finale perfectly exemplifies its tone; it closes with a song called “Something To Point To,” in which the characters describe their accomplishments that led to the creation of a functioning building—working as a guard, running “the crane that lifted the beams,” cutting the lumber, keeping the records, washing the windows, and so on. The take-away point, of course, is that each worker should revel in his or her success.
Moreover, the characters’ unified movement in their synchronized choreography has a leveling effect. It simultaneously equalizes the status of workers as different as CEOs and waitresses and emphasizes that each makes worthy contributions to society.
Whereas HUCTW is an active union and “Working” represents labor in a positive light, Lehyt presents a bleaker picture of the average union’s social weight. Lehyt’s research at the Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program made evident that unions in Massachusetts are not what they once were. “The heyday of unions was in [the] 1950s and 1960s in which you have basically hard-core industries—manufacturing,” explained José Luis Falconi, the curator of Lehyt’s exhibit and a graduate student in Romance Languages and Literatures. Thus, rather than glorifying unionizing “Organizing” actively emphasizes its demise.
Moreover, Leyht is suspicious of art’s ability to communicate real understanding of the hardship of labor. While a play may help instill a new respect for workers, it cannot teach the audience what it is like to perform backbreaking work. That cannot be understood from a seat in a theater—or at least, Lehyt would not think so. “Art cannot directly address these things in any way that his helpful,” he says. “There is action and there is art. Art is about thinking about things.”
That inability of art to inculcate in its audience understanding of something as physical as labor partly inspired the artistic abstraction of Lehyt’s work. Though he initially said he tended toward a more didactic account, he ultimately decided to produce works that gave viewers little or no direction in interpretation. “The more I thought about being direct,” Lehyt said, “the more I thought that was useless because there is a subjective aspect [or] connection to art that I thought was more useful than saying things directly.”
ABSENCE AND ABSTRACTION
People are conspicuously absent from Lehyt’s pieces. The box clearly represents the product of Lehyt’s own man-hours, but it is not the human effort that is emphasized. The piece is not about the laborers; it is about the concept of labor itself. The people are buried in the conceptual framework of Lehyt’s box. They are far from the fore.
The “calendar” does not deal directly with laborers either. Instead, the large overlapping paper squares in a scrambled grid, painted in brown and blue tones, calls to mind the place where the ocean meets the sand.
The beach is just the image Lehyt intended to invoke. His “calendar” is meant to project daydreams of freedom on workdays. “I thought of it as being away from the office, factory—escape,” he said. So while workers’ visions are splashed onto the paper, it is not the workers themselves who are the subject of the piece.
“Working”, on the other hand, is based entirely on the people performing labor. The agents of the work sing and dance and carry the plot; the people matter. Indeed, real people are the foundation for “Working.” Schwartz and Faso based the musical on “Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do,” a book of interviews published in 1974 by Louis “Studs” Terkel. The compilation aimed to highlight how real-life workers found meaning in the everyday.
There are 26 characters in “Working”, each identified by name and profession—political fundraiser, schoolteacher, UPS deliveryman, and so on. Thus characters, even those in professions typically undervalued in society, are listed in their professional capacity rather than in their relations to each other.
The musical is a product of its time, a remnant of the 1960s and the Marxist ideology in vogue then. “In the 1960s and 1970s there was a lot of progressive and radical thought that said that workers are too invisible,” said Jaeger. However, Ortiz is confident that its message still applies in contemporary society and updated its dialogue to avoid alienating a modern audience.
“In the same way that our union is steeped in traditions of the American labor movement but also trying to update and innovate, I have a sense from talking to these students that they are trying to do the same thing,” Jaeger continued. “[They are] taking some of the ideas about the dignity of work and of recognizing and humanizing working people and putting a fresh, modern, local flavor with that.”
HARVARD HUBRIS
For the students wearing the borrowed HUCTW uniforms, there seems to be an implicit assumption that their professional roles in the play will not actually be their professional post in real life. Arthur R. Bartolozzi ’12, who plays the CEO in the show, said that “most people are really shitty things they won’t be [when they get older].”
But the actors’ futures, of course, are yet to be determined.
At last weekend’s rehearsal, a general shout roused the cast: “We need Russell,” they said. Russell Y. Huang ‘12, the assistant musical director, put down his copy of “War and Peace” to play “Just a Housewife” on the piano. A group of six female Harvard students began to sing the uncharacteristically pessimistic song: “All I am is / Just a housewife / Just a housewife, nothing great / What I do is ‘out of fashion’/ What I feel is out of date.” The six actresses started twirling around the broomsticks they were holding, spinning as they sang the somber song. “I’m afraid it is unimpressive / All I am is someone’s mother.”
The scene seemed particularly poignant for six Harvard students. Despite common confidence in a Harvard degree and the modern expectation that women can have both a family and successful career, whether these six students will grow up to have both is still uncertain. It is entirely within the realm of possibility that they could become stay-at-home moms. Besides, if “Working” succeeds in its glorifying aims, the fate should not seem like a particularly “shitty” one: the play presents housewifely work as another valuable way to contribute to society. For Harvard students, the point would be well taken.
SKILLED LABOR
Though many students see it as extracurricular—an activity outside the realm of serious work—acting itself is labor of sorts. Memorizing the lines, building the set—which the cast did last Sunday as a group task—and performing are all activities that could develop into real-life professions.
The same holds for visual artists. “I’m obviously not a worker who has been subjected, I’m quite the opposite,” said Lehyt. “But everyone does something—I also do something. Art is labor.”

It would be easy to expect Barenaked Ladies to be somewhat down since the departure of their frontman and primary songwriter Steven Page last year. However, their new album, “All in Good Time” remains remarkably hopeful and upbeat. The album’s second track, “Summertime,” epitomizes this bright and hopeful feeling, acknowledging the struggles of the present, but promising better things to come: “How do we make it through the day / How do we not cave in and bottom out / Well, you have to understand that soon enough / You’ll wake up from such a daze, thanks to all the petty ways / We’re all pushing through for summertime.” This feeling of guarded hopefulness permeates the album, ensuring that “All in Good Time” remains an uplifting and enjoyable, if far from essential, album.
Hope for the future establishes itself early as one of the album’s leading themes. On “Golden Boy,” one of the album’s catchiest tunes, vocalist Ed Robertson sings, “Hey golden boy / Don’t let the darkness in you take you away from yourself / Nobody else, there’s nobody left to make you run.” Upbeat, strong chords, with some funky, synthesized piano pieces create a playful sound, which, in combination with some classical violin pieces, give the album a very harmonious and happy-go-lucky feel. “On the Lookout” and “Every Subway Car” are other good examples of joyous melodies lending themselves well to a light and easy listen.
Occasionally the album does seem to hint at genuinely darker subject matter, but these attempts feel rather half-hearted. “How Long” is a great example: “So give it up for anger / It makes us strong,” the song begins. The song’s introduction, set amidst deeper tones and more ominous beats raises expectations of a darker mood, but the pace of the song changes abruptly and resumes the album’s positivity. Similarly, “I Saw It” begins with the lyrics “I saw, I saw it / We all did / It hurt and I heard it / We all hid,” but, the song progresses to a more hopeful outlook, stating, “I won’t let you down / From this point on / I won’t let you down.” The group’s refusal to really investigate the darkness underlying these tracks means that these songs are hardly deep meditations, but they do fit together well and provide a cohesive and pleasant message.
The album does not allow its music to fall into a comfortable formula, as each track differs notably from the others. Some tracks sport choral refrains while others feature heavily rhythmic rap-like lyrics—an element which has long been part of the band’s signature style. These tracks, especially “Four Seconds,” feature a large variety of rhythmic concoctions and utilize strong percussion pieces, adding a playful banter to the album. The album also incorporates slow tracks like “The Love We’re In” which balance out the fast and upbeat nature of the rest of the album. Much of the record, however, has a folky feel to it. This is especially evident on the songs written by keyboardist Kevin Hearn such as “Northern Lights,” which is largely dominated by slow meandering guitar playing, and “Jerome,” which sounds akin to an old country song. In context, these very different types of songs encapsulate Barenaked Ladies’ mobility and freshness and contribute well to the album’s versatile sound.
Though the band celebrated its 20th anniversary two years ago, Barenaked Ladies have made a clear statement that they are not finished creating solid and fun music. Instead of settling into a particular groove, “All in Good Time” is dynamic and innovative, building on and experimenting with their sound throughout the album. And, as the band continues to produce solid records, the future, like “All in Good Time” indicates, is bright.

Rima Khalaf, this semester’s visiting scholar at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Middle East Initiative, described  poverty and human rights abuses as barriers to human development in the region during a lecture yesterday at HKS.
Khalaf, former United Nations assistant secretary-general and director of the Regional Bureau for Arab States at the U.N. Development Program, is also former deputy prime minister of Jordan.
Khalaf described increasing unemployment and poverty as a widespread problem confronting Arabs. Despite the booming economies of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Khalaf said, most Arab countries have actually seen an increase in unemployment statistics over the last decade.
“Wealth cannot be the sum total of human lives,” Khalaf said.
She described this trend of unemployment as “detrimental to people’s well-being and also to regional stability.”
Her lecture also addressed human rights and human freedoms in Arab states, focusing on women’s rights in the region.
Although Khalaf cited improvement in women’s rights in some countries during the last decade, she said that there is still room for improvement.
“Much more needs to be done to extend empowerment from the few to the many,” she said. “For this to happen, right-based legal and societal reforms need to be made.”
About 90 people, some from as far away as the American University of Beirut, attended the lecture in the Malkin Penthouse. Many attendees articulated the importance of Khalaf’s presence at the Kennedy School.
“We’re honored to have Dr. Khalaf at the Middle East Initiative,” said Hilary Rantisi, director of the Kennedy School initiative. “Her career represents the type of work that our students can aspire to.”
Lama Hassoun, a first-year Master of Science student at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that her Lebanese heritage prompted her to attend the lecture.
“I’m learning all those things that I might miss in my Harvard education that I might not have missed if I had gone to school in the region,” she said. “After I get my degree I want to go back.”
During the question-and-answer session after the lecture, Khalaf offered some hopeful comments about the future of human development in the Arab world.
“I think we can shape our future,” she said. “Each one of us can do something small, but when we put it together, it will affect the whole picture.”

Stephanie D. Wilson ’88, a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, launched into space for the third time yesterday on the space shuttle Discovery.
Wilson, an astronaut for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a missions specialist on this flight, will be working with other crew members at the International Space Station, according to a NASA press release. The mission will last for 13 days.
Wilson joined NASA in 1996 and flew her first mission a decade later. She is the second African-American woman to ever fly in space.
Wilson received her undergraduate degree in engineering science from Harvard and a masters degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas.
Wilson started her term on the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body, in 2007. She has also returned to Harvard several times to lecture about her experiences as an astronaut, according to John W. Hutchinson, who taught her as an undergraduate in Engineering Sciences 120: “Introduction to the Mechanics of Solids.”
During her undergraduate years, Wilson was “very calm and collected,” according to Hutchinson, who also served as her adviser. “She was very confident of herself in a very relaxed manner.”
In a question-and-answer session with Wilson posted on the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Web site, Wilson said she decided to be an astronaut at the age of 13.
“I’m originally from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, a small town without a lot of city lights,” she said. “I’d look up at night in my backyard and see all the stars.”
Leonard Solomon, a project manager for the Anderson Research Group, a laboratory where Wilson worked as an undergraduate, continues to stay in touch with Wilson. “She wanted to be an astronaut way back then,” he said.
Solomon is a songwriter, and on Wilson’s first flight into space, Wilson brought along a copy of one of Solomon’s CDs and took a photograph of it floating in the shuttle, Solomon said.
Over the course of her career, Wilson has been in space for over 28 days, according to the NASA Web site. Her last mission took place in 2007.
“She waited something like 10 or 12 years before she ever flew at all,” Solomon said. “Then she had three flights quickly in a row.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Art Museum has appointed Mary Schneider Enriquez ’81, an expert in Latin American art, to serve as an associate curator of modern and contemporary art, the museum announced on Friday.
Schneider Enriquez, who has served as a Latin American art adviser to the museum since 2001, is currently a visiting lecturer at Brandeis University and a Ph.D. student in Harvard’s Department of History of Art and Architecture.
“In an institution with a remarkable collection and legacy of exhibitions, I welcome the chance to explore ways to continue to integrate modern and contemporary art from a broad range of cultures into the collection that will enhance the teaching and research mission of the museum,” she said in a press release Friday.
In the past, Schneider Enriquez has co-curated an exhibition on Latin American art for the Harvard Art Museum and organized an accompanying panel discussion. She has also directed and participated in several lecture series.
Schneider Enriquez wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson that Harvard has in recent years sought to deepen its focus on cultures that have historically been “underrepresented” in the University’s curriculum and exhibitions. Her new role, she said, will allow her to supply that need from within the context of the University’s art museum.
She added that art gallery visitors can learn to make previously undiscovered connections between different cultures and that a “visual dialogue” between different types of art can expand the “perspective and context in which students and museum visitors consider the scope of art history.”
Outside of Harvard, Schneider Enriquez’s curatorial experience has included a retrospective of contemporary Latin American photographer Gerardo Suter that traveled nationally. Her 1995 exhibit, “Mexico: A Landscape Revisited”—launched in conjunction with the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.—toured internationally.
In addition to museum experience, Schneider Enriquez has also worked in other divisions of the art world. She has written as an independent art critic, and her pieces have appeared in ARTNews, ArtNexus, and Art in America magazines.
“With her long and varied background in the art world, especially in Latin America, and as someone who already has an intimate knowledge of the Art Museum and Harvard University, “[Schneider Enriquez] brings a distinct perspective to this position,” said Thomas W. Lentz, the Harvard Art Museum’s director in the press release.

Harvard and MIT have opened large parts of their library collections to undergraduates at both schools in a new partnership announced yesterday.
Students from the two universities can now apply online or in person for borrowing privileges at their counterpart institution. Harvard students will be able to access MIT libraries including the school’s expansive engineering collection, while MIT students will have access to most of Harvard College Library. HCL, which manages the circulation of over 11 million items, is the largest unit within Harvard’s library system.
The collaboration, a 14-month pilot program, comes as Harvard is reexamining its current library structure and looking to increase access to materials not found in the University’s own libraries. A similar agreement with MIT has already served faculty members and graduate students at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences since 1995.
“It’s really a wonderful thing,” said Lynne M. Schmelz, who heads Cabot Library, the undergraduate science library.
Marilyn Wood, an associate librarian for collection management at HCL, said that planning for the pilot program began last fall as part of the library’s effort to streamline its operations. “It’s really an opportunity for us to look at different models of collaboration,” Wood said.
Harvard’s library system—with its 73 separate libraries, “labyrinthine” administrative structure, and redundant collection policies—is in the midst of an internal overhaul. A Task Force was convened last spring to examine the library system and released a report in November outlining a series of suggestions to help equip the library system for the 21st century.
The Task Force’s final report emphasized that Harvard can no longer “harbor delusions” of having a completely comprehensive collection and should work to ensure that students and faculty have access to the materials they need. The report recommended greater sharing of journal subscriptions and collaboration with outside institutions such as through Borrow Direct—a library consortium that includes many Ivy League schools and allows for rapid book request and delivery.
Divinity School Professor David Lamberth, Chair of the Library Implementation Work Group, said that yesterday’s initiative is a small step toward’s the University’s greater library reform goals. Later this month, the work group will establish a subgroup focusing on external collaborations.
“The trick about collaboration is about finding things that are good for both parties,” Lamberth said.
While the current graduate student program has affected only “a fraction of our collection,” Wood said that HCL will be evaluating how undergraduates respond to the newly expanded access.
“We don’t anticipate that it will be a huge drain” on HCL’s resources, she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After listening to over an hour and a half of public comment, the Cambridge City Council passed two labor-related policy orders—one regulating the employment of housekeepers at local hotels and another requesting a cease in labor-related cuts at MIT and Harvard—at its meeting last night.
Workers from Unite Here! Local 26—the Boston area hospitality union—as well as representatives from other local hotels and businesses spoke in support of and against a resolution that would prohibit hotels in Cambridge from subcontracting housekeeping services. The resolution was passed unanimously.
Tsering Dolker, a housekeeper who has worked at the Hyatt Regency Cambridge for 17 years, said in an interview that the passing of this resolution marks the beginnings of a respectful relationship between bosses and their employees.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director for the Harvard Square Business Association, was among the few who spoke against the resolution. She suggested that the Council reconsider the order, which she said should have been directed solely at the Hyatt.
“It seems unfair to pass an order that could have detrimental effects on the rest of the hotels [in the city],” Jillson said.
Neal J. Meyer ’11, who attended the meeting on behalf of the Harvard Student Labor Action Movement, said the city should ensure reliable accommodations for parents visiting their students.
“It’s our hope that this resolution will create safe and accountable hotels—hotels that operate under a strong, direct employer-employee partnership and create an hospitable environment for guests, workers, and management,” said Meyer, who is also a Crimson photography editor.
In addition to the hotel labor order, the Council also passed a resolution to request that Harvard and MIT cease any further layoffs and cuts in hours, salary, or benefits.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who pushed for the passage of both these resolutions, said during the meeting that while the City Council is pro-business, in order to be pro-business, they have to be pro-worker first.
“Good businesses understand that they are in partnerships with their workers,” Decker said in an interview after the resolutions passed.

The Undergraduate Council voted unanimously last night to accept the second and final installment of UC election reform.
According to Rules Committee Chair Luis A. Martinez Jr. ’12, the most recent legislation seeks to address the technological aspects of running an election, whereas the first component of reform—passed at last Sunday’s general meeting—dealt mainly with clarifying the structure and duties of the Election Commission.
Under the new policy, FAS Information Technology will be required to check the Council’s electronic voting system one week before any election to assess the software’s readiness.
In the event that FAS IT deems the software unsatisfactory, each identified concern will have to be addressed before an election is held.
In addition, FAS IT will implement technology to incorporate a “keys” system so that a designee from the Office of Student Life and a quorum of three of the five election commissioners must input passwords simultaneously in order to view incoming election results.
“FAS IT is basically going to be there to make sure that we’re following all the best practices with our software as we should be,” Martinez said.
While the UC’s Election Reform Task Force proposal originally included a cash stipend for election commissioners, the final legislation left out this provision.
Eliot representative Allen Yang ’11 said that after “a heated debate” in Rules Committee, members felt that the stipend idea was not “very strong nor palatable” at this point but could be left for future Councils to consider.
Martinez said the Rules Committee ultimately felt uncomfortable allocating money from the $75 student activities fee included on undergraduate term bills to “pay commissioners to run our elections.”
He said that other non-monentary incentives,  will still be considered.
The stipend was originally proposed in an effort to attract a more diverse group of election commissioners, UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said at the time the preliminary election reform report was released.
During yesterday’s general meeting, the Council also passed legislation to retroactively fund inflatable jousting featured at the UC-sponsored barbeque tailgate at last Friday’s Harvard men’s lacrosse game against Duke.
The UC also provided fans with 3500 red Harvard shirts for the game.

A banner proclaiming “Take Back the Night” hung above the women and men gathered in Ticknor Lounge at last night’s kickoff event for Harvard’s Sexual Assault Awareness Month programming.
The words “Take Back the Night” refer to an annual, nationwide event aimed at empowering survivors, raising awareness, and fostering a community for women who have faced sexual assault.
Harvard’s activities this month—organized by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, Harvard Men Against Rape, and the peer counseling group Response—will feature a series of events on topics ranging from date rape to the media’s construction of masculinity and ending with a candlelight vigil where sexual assault survivors can share their stories and find support from the community.
“This month is about taking back the community and making it safe and secure for everyone to walk during the night,” said Tamar Holoshitz ’10, an OSAPR volunteer and one of the organizers of the sexual assault awareness programming. “Safety should not be a privilege.”
OSAPR Director Sarah A. Rankin said that many people do not realize that sexual assault is prevalent on Harvard’s campus. “This month is dedicated to raising a dialogue about sexual assault and also self-respect, communication, and consent. We want to show that sexual assault is preventable, and that men care a lot more about preventing this than people may think,” Rankin said.
Jack J. Holuba ’13, a football player who loomed a head or more taller than most of the women in the room, said that it was important to combat portrayals of masculinity that reinforce stereotypes that objectify women.
“We want to let people know that the lifestyle all about getting with girls and putting another notch on the belt is not acceptable,” said Holuba, who is also a member of Harvard Men Against Rape and volunteers in the OSAPR office. He added that a major objective of Sexual Assault Awareness Month is not only to raise awareness for victims and people at risk, but to create sensitivity around issues of sexual assault.
“We need to change the culture that thinks it’s okay to say things like ‘that midterm raped me,’” Holuba said.
Holoshitz said that it was important that men who are concerned about sexual assault help contribute to the solution, particularly on college campuses.
“Our goal is to create a space where survivors can come forward and seek help and feel their community is supporting them,” she said. “We’re trying to put a public face to this issue and educate the campus about prevention.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Census Day 2010—April 1, the deadline to turn in the decennial United States population measure form—has come and gone. But some groups, such as the large populations of students living on college campuses, remain to be counted.
COUNTING THE COLLEGE KIDS
The ten-question 2010 Census—reduced to just seven questions for college students—reached mailboxes across the country last month, but just began to arrive in Harvard undergraduates’ mailboxes yesterday. “People should be counted where they live and sleep most of the year,” the form states, and for most Harvard undergraduates, that place is Harvard.
An e-mail sent campus-wide informed undergraduates of the one-week deadline to complete their own Census forms. The University is allowing students to return these forms to their respective houses’ offices or, for freshmen, to the basement of Weld Hall.
According to Laura M. Waldon, the LGBT and Census on Campus Outreach Partnership Specialist for the Census Bureau’s Boston Regional Office, college students are among the populations that are most difficult to reach, along with non-English speaking people and those in trouble with the government.
“College students have the lowest return number,” Waldon said, attributing low participation rates to confusion regarding correct state of residency and a failure to understand the important consequences of the data collected from census forms.
Areas such as school campuses are categorized by the Census Bureau as “group quarters.” In such situations, the way in which students are counted is left up to the administrations of various institutions. Options include distributing the forms individually to all its students’ mailboxes—Harvard’s chosen method—or allowing Census numerators to set up count stations on campus.
Some Harvard students have been aiding in the Census collection process.
“We’re trying to promote civic engagement in a non-partisan way,” said Elizabeth J. Newton ’11, the IOP Community Action Committee Chair who has been working on Census outreach this semester.
Jenny Ye ’13 has also been coordinating Census outreach events, such as tabling in front of the Science Center.
“Even though Harvard students are always busy...it’s important that [Mass.’s] count is accurate so that it can receive that representation and federal funding that it deserves,” she wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
A CRUCIAL COUNT, A COMMUNITY EFFORT
At the municipal level, the effort to make sure that Census forms representing the Cambridge population are filled out is, to a large extent, driven by members of the community.
According to the City of Cambridge Web site, the Census return rate for Cambridge as of yesterday was 56 percent, five percentage points lower than the current overall Mass. participation rate.
The city’s effort began in September of last year with the formation of the Cambridge Complete Count Committee, a group comprised of city management staff and leaders from different community organizations.
Tests for people attempting to join the Complete Count local liaison group have been conducted for over a year on a rolling basis, according to Waldon. The group’s key roles have been to publicize widely that the census is coming, that the census process is easy, that all collected data is confidential even to other government bureaus, and that an accurate count is crucial for the well-being of community programs and services.
Thomas J. Lucey, Harvard’s director of community relations for Cambridge and a member of Cambridge’s Complete Count Committee, said the Cambridge Election Commission approached him to serve as “a point of contact” between Harvard and Cambridge, because the city needed assistance in counting all of Harvard’s students. But according to Lucey, Harvard and Cambridge have each been working independently to push people to return their forms.
In addition community outreach groups, the Census Bureau has heavily employed paid advertisements in cities across the country this year.
“10 Questions. 10 Minutes. Make a difference!” exclaims a poster plastered to the side of an MBTA bus. Such advertisements are ubiquitous in Cambridge—some cars on the Red Line of the T have been entirely filled with Census ads.
According to Waldon, the 2000 Census marked the first time the Bureau employed widespread advertising.
“They found the first increase in accuracy,” she said. “After that they have done a much larger scale of paid advertisement to help increase awareness.”

The 2010 Census will reveal more about the country’s diversity in terms of ethnicity and sexual orientation than any previous count, and will reflect population movement resulting from the recent economic downturn, Harvard professors who study population, ethnicity, and public health predict.
This year’s census will provide new information in part because of changes to the survey. For instance, this year for the first time respondents may report being married to a same-sex partner; in prior censuses, these statistics were “corrected” by forcing one member of the pair to identify as male and the other as female, according to Nancy Krieger, a professor of society, human development, and health at the Harvard School of Public Health. This census may therefore provide the most accurate count to date of how many same sex couples there are in the U.S., she said.
Data compiled from the 2010 census is also likely to show a dramatic increase in the number of people identifying with multiple races, according to Professor of Government and African and African American Studies Jennifer  Hochschild. This, along with increasing immigration and high birthrates among ethnic minorities, will result in a proportional decrease in the number of people identifying themselves as “white,” Hochschild said.
Respondents have been able to select multiple ethnicities since the 2000 census, but Hochschild said she expects more people will take advantage of the change this year.
“The idea is much more familiar to people now and it’s much less politically fraught—partly because people are more used to it, and partly because there are new rules for reallocating people back to a given race,” Hochschild said.
The census may also show significant age-dependent demographic differences within ethnic groups, according to John D. Della Volpe, director of polling at the Institute of Politics, whose research indicates that income and average age differ notably between first and second generation immigrants.
In particular, he said that first generation Hispanics have significantly lower incomes and have children earlier in life than do second generation Hispanics, and that this generation gap should affect how their opinions are interpreted.
“Being Hispanic is not a good predictor of things like political leaning and levels of economic success. Better predictors are things like languages spoken and generation,” Della Volpe said.
Additionally, Hochschild and Della Volpe both said they think that the 2010 census will reveal some of the far-reaching societal effects of the recent economic recession.  Della Volpe said that population booms in places like Arizona and Las Vegas, which had been spurred by economic growth, will reverse. Widespread unemployment may cause a drastic decrease in population in industrial cities, he said.
Meanwhile, some trends  are likely to continue from earlier years. In particular, Professor of Sociology Peter V. Marsden said that both the average age of the U.S. population and the rate of immigration into the country may continue increasing.
Age distribution patterns within ethnic groups are likely to continue as well, such as the existing trend that the Hispanic population tends to be the youngest on average, while the white population tends to be the oldest, Hochschild said. Underlying social factors, such as the average age of immigrants and high birthrates, serve to perpetuate these patterns.
The information gathered in this census will be used to allocate political representation in Congress, apportion federal funds and levy taxes according to population.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana and Tobin Project Acting Executive Director Stephanie R. Khurana chat on the patio alongside the Cabot dining hall, their three children play catch in the Quad.
Repeated and vigorous throws by Jai—the couple’s 7-year-old son—constantly elude his two sisters’ grasps. Later, he makes his way to the ramp leading up to the residences at Cabot. Energetically jumping over the banister, he accidentally bites his tongue, and Nalini and Sonia—Jai’s 11-year-old and 13-year-old sisters, respectively—escort him to their parents.
For all intents and purposes, the Khuranas already seem at home.
But the incoming Cabot House Masters say they seek to make this home even better. Guided by their entrepreneurial spirit, the couple strives to create what Rakesh Khurana calls a “generative community,” one that allows people to develop as individuals while remaining part of a broader group of undergraduates, alumni, and Harvard affiliates in the House.
VISION FOR CABOT
The HBS professor and his wife, both of whom have helped establish a range of companies, have already brought business acumen to their new leadership roles in Cabot, as they rattle off phrases like “growth opportunities,” “win-win situation,” and “potential possibilities” to describe their vision for Cabot House. But entrepreneurial skills are only one of many traits the couple say they will bring to the helm of Cabot House.
Their goal, forming a “generative community,” stems from Rakesh Khurana’s training as a sociologist and his research on leadership in business.
“We’re going to spend a lot of time listening to the students and understanding what their hopes and goals and potential possibilities are, and support them as best as we can,” Rakesh Khurana says.
The Khuranas say their backgrounds will allow them to address challenges in innovative ways. A co-founder of companies in industries ranging from technology to health care, Stephanie Khurana says she is always “trying to create something new.”
“There’s always a lot of potential with any new situation,” Stephanie Khurana says. “The excitement comes from what could be or what should be, and then making it happen.”
Speaking in the abstract, Stephanie Khurana says the transformation from potential to reality is reflected strongly in the college experience—where undergraduates enter with aspirations and leave with a diploma and a sense of their place in the world, she adds.
And the two say they believe that the Houses are the place to make that happen.
“That’s what I think the college experience is about,” Rakesh Khurana says. “Part of it is in the classroom—a really important part—but part of it is outside of what happens in the classroom, and I think a lot of that happens at the House level.”
IVY LEAGUERS FOR LIFE
“I love being surrounded by people smarter than we are,” says Rakesh Khurana about living in Cabot.
Born in India but raised in Queens, Rakesh Khurana majored in economics and industrial labor relations at Cornell University, graduating in 1990. A studious undergraduate who spent many nights in the library, Rakesh Khurana says he found an outlet in photography and in running.
His wife, Stephanie Khurana, also studied at Cornell, where she graduated in 1989 after a childhood in Ohio and Maryland. She spent much of her time working with Cornell’s Panhellenic Council to initiate new programs, an activity that foreshadowed her later career as an entrepreneur.
But the two did not meet until after graduation when they both worked with the same startup, Cambridge Technology Partners. After three or four years as close friends and running buddies, the two started dating before they both pursued multiple graduate degrees at Harvard. By the end of their education, Rakesh Khurana had earned an A.M. in sociology and a Ph.D. in organizational behavior, while his wife had an M.P.P. from the Kennedy School and an M.B.A. from the Business School.
And though the two came from different cultural backgrounds and religious upbringings, Rakesh Khurana says such “surface-level differences” mattered much less than their shared values. This, he says, is integral to the modern college experience, where many people from various backgrounds have the opportunity to connect.
A DECISION FOR THE FAMILY
Recalling the House Master selection process, the Khuranas say that several people were involved in their decision to pursue the Cabot House Mastership.
During the process, the Khurana family not only met with students, tutors, and House staff, but they also had lengthy, candid conversations with the three sets of outgoing Masters—Sandra F. Naddaff ’75 and Leigh G. Hafrey ’73 of Mather, Lino Pertile and Anna Bensted of Eliot, and Jay M. Harris and Cheryl L. Harris of Cabot, all of whom announced their retirements from House Mastership last semester. The Khuranas add that each pair helped elucidate what the position entailed.
“They were very open, shared everything down to sometimes even their schedule books,” Rakesh Khurana says.
But the couple also sought input from their three children: Sonia, Nalini, and Jai.
“It was a family decision, not a mom-and-dad decision,” Rakesh Khurana says.
The Khuranas say they had been interested in House Master positions for some time but were waiting for an appropriate time for their family to undertake the role. Now, the children have hit the right age—they’re young enough to benefit from the House environment, but old enough that “they have a sense of self and who they are,” Stephanie Khurana adds.
That sense of togetherness, reflected in their decision-making process, is part of what Rakesh and Stephanie Khurana say they hope to bring to Cabot. They say they plan to work with Cabot’s staff, students, and House Committee to develop and improve community in the House they will call home come the end of this academic year.
“What we do together is infinitely better than what any of us can do alone,” Rakesh Khurana says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Instead of reading a book about the history of the American quilt, some freshmen stitched their own last fall. And instead of listening to a lecture about the cultural significance of composer Leonard Bernstein, another group of freshmen danced to excerpts from his masterpiece “West Side Story.”
These are just two examples of the twelve freshman seminars available this academic year that include an art-making component.
Using extra funding provided by University President Drew G. Faust last year, the Freshman Seminar Program created a new set of seminars that combine traditional academic learning with a more artistic, hands-on approach.
Roughly ten percent of students currently enrolled in the Freshman Seminar Program have opted for seminars that include some form of art-making, according to program director Sandra F. Naddaff ’75.
The excitement surrounding the new course offerings has not been limited only to students, but has extended to faculty as well, according to Naddaff.
“It was very exciting to see the creativity with which the faculty responded to this opportunity,” she said.
This year, for example, History Professor Laurel Ulrich—renowned for coining the phrase “Well-behaved women seldom make history”—inserted a quilt-making unit into her material history seminar on the significance of the American quilt.
“One of the ways to understand an artifact is to try to understand how it was made, and one of the ways to understand how it was made is to try some of the steps,” Ulrich said. “I was surprised how much people learned by trying to do it.”
BEYOND ACADEMIA
From the perspective of Expository Writing Preceptor Zachary C. Sifuentes ’97-’99, the freshman seminars that include an art-making component encourage students to look beyond traditional methods of learning and to directly interact with the art itself.
“Around here, I’ve seen that we often try to solve problems just with our heads and not our hands,” Sifuentes said. “Doing and reflecting and re-doing makes it happen a lot faster.”
By offering students the opportunity to play with letter types on the page, Sifuentes’ seminar—“Pressing the Page: Making Art with Letters, Paper, and Ink”—allows freshmen to consider language as a physical process and artform.
Sifuentes added that the manual creation of prints has a mystical quality, particularly in an era of computer printers. The print-making process “physically” inserts the creator and generates “much more immediate interaction,” he said.
“What we’re doing is...physically manifesting the process that a lot of scholarship engages in, the thinking on paper,” Sifuentes said.
The hands-on approach of seminars like Sifuentes’ offers a unique experience for freshmen, who may later grow jaded by the standard classroom methodologies at Harvard, he said.
“Lots of people forget that learning was fun for them,” Sifuentes added.
LEARNING THROUGH DOING
While Sifuentes’s seminar is almost exclusively activity-based learning, most of the art-making freshman seminars balance this component with comprehensive grounding in academic and theoretical learning.
Though Dramatic Arts Lecturer Remo F. Airaldi assigns readings to his students in “The Art and Craft of Acting,” he also asks them to keep a journal about their daily musings on performance art. Students are further required to attend showings at the American Repertory Theater.
In “Movement and Meaning: Dance Culture, and Identity in the 20th Century”—which also seeks to balance academic and creative approaches toward a given artform—students spent the first half of every seminar practicing movement exercises.
“When it comes to kinesthetic activity, you can only say so much in writing as opposed to experiencing it with your body.” said Shayna R.M. Skal ’13, who took the course last fall.
For her final project, Skal not only used theoretical readings from the course, but choreographed and performed a dance by using chance procedure, a method of choreography introduced in class.
Chance procedure involves developing short movement phrases in varying length and size and then performing them in random order—a strategy quite different from the strict choreography of ballet that Skal had trained in before coming to college.
“I was so used to classical ballet—you follow the beat, you have your accent on that counter note,” said Skal, who added that she had been apprehensive about performing a piece using such an unfamiliar method.
NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY
Even for someone like Skal, who had danced ballet before college, the Freshmen Seminar Program allows students of varying experiences to expand their horizons in the arts.
“The idea of a freshman seminar is that you can try something totally out of your comfort zone, something that you are not sure you are going to excel at whatsoever,” said Miriam E. Psychas ’13, who took the “Movement and Meaning” seminar.
Psychas, who likes to “dance for fun” but never studied the art in an academic setting, said she thought the seminar would be an “interesting way to look at something that I do so often in a totally different perspective.”
The seminars expose students to a wide range of traditions in the arts—and even the more experienced of the group said they benefit from the diversity.
Skal, who has trained in ballet since the age of four, said that the less-experienced students’ input during a class discussion of the ballet classic “The Rite of Spring” allowed her to view the subject with fresh perspective.
Skal said that she had been “so busy with the technical side” of the performance, that she had not noticed the more abstract interpretations of the dance and the authentic “religious, ritual feel” of the style cited by her classmates.
A LOW-STRESS ENVIRONMENT
Current freshman seminar students said that individuals who lack experience in the arts feel comfortable enrolling in these art-making courses because they are taken pass-fail.
Even experienced students said that they found themselves exploring topics and areas that they may not have entertained had the course been graded traditionally.
Had Skal’s final project been subject to “more of a stringent grade,” she said she probably would not have chosen to explore such an unfamiliar dance method.
Psychas said that she had a similar experience while writing papers for the “Movement” course.
“It was cool in that you felt like you could take a risk,” said Psychas, adding that she chose topics she was interested in, despite the uncertainty that she would be able to develop a strong argument in an unfamiliar terrain.
At one point, Psychas said she chose to write a paper that compared originals and remakes of musicals involving dance, such as “Hairspray” and “Dirty Dancing.”
“It was a really awesome opportunity to watch all these musicals that I had really wanted to watch and then analyze them and write about them,” Psychas said. “But had it been a graded class, I wouldn’t have risked choosing a topic that was kind of out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The legality of unpaid internships at domestic, for-profit companies are under scrutiny the New York Times reported Friday, but this may not be a major issue for Harvard students seeking summer internships, according to Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities.
Mount said 35 percent of internships in the OCS job database, Crimson Careers, are unpaid. She added that most of these are likely for non-profit organizations that can legally accept volunteer work or for firms abroad not covered by U.S. labor law.
Nationally, a number of states—including New York, California, and Oregon—have begun investigating and in some cases even fining employers who host unpaid interns.
Federal and Massachusetts labor laws include standards unpaid internships must meet to be exempt from federal and state minimum wage laws. According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division, unpaid internships at for-profit firms must fulfill six criteria. Among them, the experience must offer vocational training and not provide “immediate advantage to the employer.”
Mount said OCS does not check if opportunities posted on Crimson Careers comply with minimum wage standards. “We’re not really in the business of scrutinizing all the internships that come to us,” she said. “It’s a sort of self-post system.”
OCS includes a disclaimer informing students that they are responsible for verifying the legitimacy and legality of the opportunities listed on their Web site.
Harvard students who do pursue unpaid domestic internships at for-profit companies may seek stipends from Harvard centers, such as the Institute of Politics. But, according to IOP Student Internship Chair Christopher W. Danello ’12, IOP Summer Stipend recipients do not generally work at for-profit companies.
A related problem that Harvard students seeking internships sometimes face is that some unpaid opportunities require students to receive academic credit in order to comply with minimum wage laws. Mount said that Harvard does not grant academic credit for internships, though students have arranged for independent studies with faculty in the past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the 2010 census is unlikely to reflect major changes in the socioeconomic and ethnic makeup of Cambridge over the past ten years, community leaders say they hope that “hidden” groups—specifically same-sex couples and the Portuguese-speaking population—will be more accurately represented in this year’s count.
For the first time, same-sex couples in Cambridge will be officially recognized on the census forms. In the past, the form only allowed heterosexual couples to describe themselves as “married,” but the Census Bureau announced last year that in 2010 the survey will recognize same-sex couples who report being married.
John W. Gintell, co-chair of the Cambridge LGBT Commission, said he hopes that comprehensive statistics will help open minds about the presence of same-sex couples in the Cambridge community.
“Knowing about how many same-sex couples are out there, living their lives, will help remove some people’s prejudice,” Gintell said.
Meanwhile, leaders in the Portuguese-speaking community are encouraging members to write “Portuguese” as their ethnicity on census forms, instead of White, Black, or Latino. Leaders hope that the write-in campaign will result in a census that represents a more accurate count of a population that, while large, has been invisible in federal statistics.
“The Portuguese community is severely undercounted,” said Paulo R. Pinto, executive director of the Massachusetts Alliance of Portuguese Speakers. “It is the second most spoken language in Massachusetts. We need to be counted to empower this community.”
Members of the Portuguese-speaking community—which includes those from Brazil and Cape Verde—number close to 15,000 in Cambridge, and as much as 1 million by conservative estimates in Massachusetts, according to Pinto.
The Massachusetts Alliance of Portuguese Speakers, the LGBT Commission, and other community groups are working with the Cambridge Complete Count Committee—formed by then-Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons last year—to promote broader participation in the census.
Census data is used to allocate federal funds, which sometimes target specific populations. In the case of Portuguese-speaking Cantabrigians, such funds would go toward social services and educational programs in Portuguese.
In addition to reflecting the presence of these newly-represented communities, the 2010 census will likely show population growth, as over 4,000 housing units were added to the city in the past ten years, according to Clifford M. Cook, planning information manager for the city.
Cook said that new dormitories at Harvard and MIT will likely translate into an increase in the student population, though he also anticipated that the city’s population will be on average older than in past years, as baby boomers age. Cambridge school enrollments have stayed relatively constant, Cook said.
But the socioeconomic and ethnic makeup of Cambridge is unlikely to have changed significantly. The high rents and cost of living mean that those who can afford to live in Cambridge are either in high-income brackets or qualify for low-income housing—and those populations stay relatively constant, according to Michael J. Johnston, deputy executive director of the Cambridge Housing Authority.
The last census saw a shift in socioeconomic diversity as rent-control ended in Cambridge, but the effects of that are “water well under the bridge” now, Cook said.
He added that he does not expect to see income statistics change as a result of the recent economic recession, citing Cambridge’s highly educated population as an insulating factor.
“It hasn’t made much of a dent overall,” Cook said of the financial crisis. “If you’re gonna pick a place to be in a depression, Cambridge isn’t bad.”
Because Cambridge remains a relatively wealthy city with limited low-income housing, it has not experienced the same influx of immigrants as Greater Boston has in the past decade.
Cambridge also bucks the trend seen in Boston and nationwide of a large increase in Hispanic populations. The ethnic makeup of waitlists for public housing in Cambridge has changed little over the past ten years, with Portuguese speakers and Haitians comprising most of the minority applicants, according to Johnston.
Much of the Portuguese-speaking community in Cambridge remains in the city because members purchased homes years ago when property values were lower, and homeowners now rent to newer immigrants well below the market rate, according to Pinto.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, Harvard guard Jeremy Lin will begin his quest to the NBA as he goes up against the nation’s best seniors at the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament in Virginia.
Lin is currently viewed by scouts as a borderline late second-round pick. The Crimson star will need to improve his stock by a good margin in the next ten weeks if he is to get drafted.
One team that Lin has certainly drawn interest from is the local Boston Celtics. 14 NBA scouts reportedly attended the February 19th Harvard-Cornell game, as did Celtics GM Danny Ainge.
The Celtics make sense for Lin since he already has a fanbase in the Boston area. Additionally, the NBA's most storied franchise holds a pick late in the second round.
I've had the opportunity to speak with Celtics Assistant GM Mike Zarren on multiple occasions about Lin, and though he obviously could not indicate the team's draft plans, he admitted Lin was certainly somebody who was on their radar.  Zarren said he did not know who Cornell's Ryan Wittman was, indicating the team was there to scout Lin–and Lin only–at the Harvard-Cornell game.
ESPN's Chad Ford has Lin ranked 96th among his top prospects for the upcoming draft.  His scouting report describes Lin as "a quick point guard, a tenacious defender [with] a high basketball IQ, and a leader on the floor." His negatives are that he "doesn't play against great competition at Harvard, and is a bit of a tweener."
Lin was featured in Time Magazine and Sports Illustrated and on ESPN.com this season, with the focus of the articles revolving around his status as an Asian-American basketball star.  There are no current Asian-Americans in the NBA.
Thus, one thing Lin has strongly going for him is the possibility that teams could use him as a marketing ploy. He has a large Asian-American fan base; Lin's return to his native Bay Area earlier this season for a game against Santa Clara drew the Broncos' largest crowd ever for a non-conference game.  He has over 1,800 Facebook fans, more than bigger-school stars like DaSean Butler, Greg Monroe, and Luke Harangody.
Lin is a very good defensive point guard, ranking 15th in the country this past season with 2.50 steals per game.  He's also very athletic for a guard, as evidenced by his two highlight-reel dunks against Connecticut.  Though he is often able to create his own shot and get to the basket, he may have to change the form of his shot, which is not the picture-perfect style scouts typically look for in an NBA player.
But Lin has no worries about the challenge he'll face this coming week.
"[I just need to] stay true to myself and stay true to my game," Lin says.

The most stressful part about Harvard is getting in, right? Wrong.
On its list of the 50 Most Stressful Colleges, The Daily Beast—an online news site—ranked Harvard fifth, behind Stanford, Columbia, MIT, and Penn. The schools were ranked based on a hodgepodge of disparate categories: cost, competitiveness, acceptance rate, crime on campus, and the ranking of their engineering programs.
According to the Beast, the more students have to worry about money, the more they stress.  Harvard’s hefty cost is definitely a source of anxiety for some students. But the Daily Beast fails to account for Harvard’s generous financial aid, which helps to take off some of the pressure.
It’s the school work, however, that really boosts Harvard’s ranking. The Beast ranked Harvard and Princeton as the most academically challenging schools in the nation.
That’s right. Our school is harder than Yale, MIT and Caltech.
According to the Daily Beast’s logic, Harvard’s minute acceptance rate is also a source of frustration for students, even after they get in. “More competitive schools generally produce a more competitive student body,” the post reads.
The Beast also seems to think that schools with better engineering programs are inherently more stressful. Advantage, MIT. Our neighbor down the river bolstered its stress ranking with the top engineering program in the country. Meanwhile Harvard’s sits at number 15.
The last factor the Beast considered was the amount of crime on campus.  Apparently, our little bubble isn’t that safe—Harvard was ranked the second least-safe campus of the schools considered. No. 1? Tufts University.
Where did the rest of the Ivies rank? Princeton came in at 6, Yale at 12, Dartmouth at 14, Cornell at 17, and Brown rounded out the Ancient Eight at 20.

It’s that time of year again. Admissions letters (and e-mails) are out, previously unreachable college admissions officers are calling you off the hook, and suddenly high school feels oh-so-passé. The Intel-winning genius in your physics class? He’s on the field playing Ultimate instead of taking a practice AP. Missing valedictorian? Better hope he/she will be back for graduation. Whether you call it senior slump, senior slide, or senioritis, it is highly contagious and supremely difficult to eradicate.
Every high school senior interviewed said they’d seen the performance of their peers fall off. “Everybody in my high school has definitely decreased the amount of effort they put in since senior year started,” said Nikhil Mulani of Lake Forest, Il. “After winter break most people started slacking off…”
Paula Maouyo of Baltimore found the same situation in her school: “I definitely see a lot of my friends…slacking off a little bit.”
But, where generations of teachers have tried to prevent their students from catching senioritis, the hyper-competitive reality of college admissions may end up being the best cure—at least for some high school seniors.
Harvard announced it admitted only 6.9 percent of its applicants; Yale, 7.2 percent; Princeton, 8.2 percent.
More students than ever are being waitlisted at top universities and “the waitlist will keep senior slide a myth,” said Tim Lear, director of college counseling at The Pingry School in Martinsville, NJ.
While Harvard has not yet disclosed how many students have been waitlisted, Yale waitlisted 932 (taking only seven students off last year) and Princeton waitlisted 1,451.
“[At the beginning of the year] we talk to our seniors about how their grades matter,” said Rod Skinner, director of college counseling at Milton Academy in Milton, MA. “The anxiety, not only for kids on waitlists but all of the seniors, never really disappears because colleges can pull your ticket.”
And college counselors say many of the same students who are accepted into the Ivy League are the type of students who continue working through senior spring.
“I almost have this feeling that the acceptance will inspire me to work harder in some classes like math and physics so that I come to college with this momentum and absorb all I can,” said Daniel Cooney of Westchester, NY.
So for all of you admitted to Harvard, keep on enjoying your senior year of high school but keep this in mind. All of us here were guilty of senior slump, some more than others, but we all managed to get on stage to receive our high school diploma.

“Only God and Bill Gates have more money than Harvard!” We’ve all heard this phrase being shouted—often from all the way across the Yard—by the guides working for Unofficial Tours.
Now we have the chance to see the man behind the joke. Bill Gates is scheduled to speak at Sanders Theatre on April 21 at 3 p.m.
His talk, entitled “Giving Back: Finding the Best Way to Make a Difference,” is going to address some of the most complicated and pressing issues facing our modern world. He will discuss the importance of charity work, which has taken a larger role in his life since he decided to start working full-time for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
If you’d like to hear Gates speak, you can request a ticket up until noon on April 15. In all likelihood, there will be high demand for a chance to see the former head of Microsoft. The tickets are going to be lotteried and results will be released April 19.
