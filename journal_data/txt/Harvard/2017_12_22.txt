After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When readers think of Jane Austen and her writing, matters of matrimony, inheritance, and land ownership likely come to mind. The theater company Bedlam does not stray too far from these elements of Austen’s world in its approach to staging “Sense & Sensibility,” a new play by Kate Hamill which runs at the Loeb Drama Center through Jan. 14. Chock full of marriage-minded gossip, drawing room coyness, and well-timed quips—not to mention clever staging—the production provides a lively and lighthearted evening of entertainment that will delight fans of the 19th century novel, as long as they are not Austen purists.
In a nutshell, this production of “Sense & Sensibility” follows the lives of Mrs. Dashwood (Lisa Birnbaum) and her daughters, Elinor (Maggie Adams McDowell), Marianne (Jessica Frey), and Margaret (Violeta Picayo), after Mr. Dashwood (James Patrick Nelson) dies. When his son from his first marriage inherits the family home, the Dashwoods must leave to find new lodgings. “It was a question of the law,” Mr. Dashwood says, waking briefly from his upright deathbed, creatively staged with some of the ensemble holding up a topsheet while others used their bodies to form Mr. Dashwood’s bedside table. Matches and misfires inevitably ensue as the family determines who can afford to marry the poor Dashwood sisters.
Bedlam invigorates Austen’s money-and-marriage premises with motion and movement. As the show begins, cast members dressed in loose-fitting pants and grayscale tops shimmy and snap to the groovy beats of Pharrell Williams’s 2014 song “Come Get it Bae.” As the dance proceeds, the cast strips off their 21st-century outfits to reveal 19th-century white and billowy undergarments, and the routine morphs into a country ball, complete with balletic arm movements and the tasteful strumming of violins. Past and present mingle in a way that does not feel distractingly anachronistic but, rather, resounds with joy. As director Eric Tucker writes in his program note, “Austen’s stories resonate with us today because not all that much has really changed about people. We love gossip and intrigue and celebrity. We fall in love with people we can’t have and people we shouldn’t have and people our parents hate.”
Yet the production’s novelty is not in its “timeless” subject matter (indeed, if Austen’s novels and 19th-century British life are not your cup of tea, this show may not be for you). The set and blocking are instead what keep the show moving—quite literally with wheels. The set pieces—elegant, free-standing window frames and simple chairs which set the stage for heart-to-heart conversations in the parlor as well as boisterous dinner parties—are all on wheels. At one of Mrs. Jennings’s country dinners, for example, the guests gossip about the dull Colonel Brandon’s (also James Patrick Nelson) affection for the youthful and vibrant Marianne. As Marianne plays the pianoforte and Colonel Brandon watches, cast members make comedic use of the props’ wheels, pushing Marianne’s piano bench and Colonel Brandon’s chair closer together.
Throughout the show, the ensemble uses the set’s mobility to heighten the show’s farcical elements and keep the eye moving. When Elinor cautions Marianne to be sensible about a suitor’s impropriety—John Willoughby (Benjamin Russell) has offered to buy her a horse—the ensemble balances on nearby chairs, trying to camouflage themselves as topiaries or statues. As Elinor chides Marianne for even considering to accept Willoughby’s gift without the pair’s formal courtship, the ensemble use the chairs’ wheels to inch themselves closer to the sisters to catch wind of their intimate conversation.
Like Austen’s novels, Bedlam’s production of “Sense & Sensibility” hinges on blithe female protagonists and suitors with tangled backstories, played pleasantly by an entertaining cast. Like the novel, the show, too, muses on the benefits of thinking reasonably versus giving in to emotions and passions. With such energy, the cast moves back-and-forth across the stage, inviting audience members into the gossipy fray for an evening of lively, lighthearted Austenian fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandals, stories by female filmmakers now carry a particular gravitas—a fact especially relevant to Greta Gerwig, director of “Lady Bird.” Gerwig’s coming-of-age film revolves around a young woman (Saoirse Ronan) from Sacramento, California, whose personal search for identity coincides with all the rites of passage of senior year of high school—college application period, first boyfriends, prom. Early into awards season, Gerwig’s directorial debut has already seen accolades ranging from a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes to Best Picture at the New York Film Critics Circle.

“This year has been an amazing year for women in film,” Greta Gerwig said. “Whether it’s a big blockbuster like Patty Jenkins with ‘Wonder Woman,’ or Angelina Jolie with ‘First They Killed My Father,’ or Maggie Betts with ‘Novitiate,’ or Dee Rees with ‘Mudbound.’ It’s just an extraordinary year, and to be part of it is very meaningful to me.”
Critics and audiences have heralded “Lady Bird” as a triumph for stories about teenage girls—a genre that has historically been omitted from “high-brow” film, until recently. “I feel like they’re stories that are somewhat harder to get made or greenlit because they don’t have a genre,” she said. “But I think they’re important to tell because they’re these windows into the lives of girls and women that we don’t get to see if there aren’t female writers and directors and creators.”
“Because there’s a lack of female creators, [female adolescence] is less documented than [its counterpart,] male coming-of-age stories,” Gerwig continued. “I love male coming-of-age stories, and I have nothing against them, but I’m always interested to see what the female version of that is. What is ‘Boyhood’ for a girl? What is ‘The 400 Blows’ for a girl? I felt that I had not seen that as much as I wanted to, so I wanted to make something that was about not only a young woman, but about a mother and a family and a place.”
Gerwig’s focus on familial love resonates in the film’s affectionate treatment of title character Lady Bird and her mother. “I love romance just as much as the next person, and I certainly love romance in movies, but I think romance—especially heterosexual romance—has got a lot of great movies,” Gerwig said. “I didn’t feel that it was particularly, for me at that moment, uncharted territory. It felt like I was interested in emotional relationships that were just as deep and vivid and filled with love and complexity, but that wasn’t a heterosexual romance.”
Though “Lady Bird” is Gerwig’s directorial debut, her filmography mostly credits her as an actress—a background that, she says, colored much of her approach to directing. “I have this intimate understanding of how difficult it is to act on a film set,” she said. “That accumulation of experience added up to what I hoped for the actors was this very productive, very free, very safe environment where they felt like they could play with their characters and create their own characters.”
Although much of the plot of “Lady Bird” parallels Gerwig’s own personal life—both Gerwig and Lady Bird attended Catholic school in Sacramento, then matriculated to university in New York City—she discussed the film’s deviations from autobiography. “Almost always I start with some kernel that’s real, and then very quickly the characters spin out and become people, and the events of the film have their own shape and form that’s outside of the events of my life,” she said. “It’s never mattered to me as a consumer of art what the connection is to the actual autobiography.”
Perhaps it was Gerwig’s status as a Sacramento native that allowed her to portray the town authentically, for all its quirk and nuance. “The more specific you make something, the more universal it will be,” Gerwig said. “So I didn’t want to make it any town. I wanted to make it this town, and this place, and these people.”
The attention to detail pays off. “I didn’t expect how many people would say to me, ‘I’ve never been to Sacramento, but I have a Sacramento in my heart,’” Gerwig said. “It makes me incredibly pleased, and also it’s kind of incredible that everybody can understand it. But I think that’s always the thing I love most about movies. They can take you to worlds you’ve never been in and that you’ll never be able to go in, and you’ll feel like you know it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Director Guillermo del Toro has one foot in reality and the other in magic. His most critically acclaimed film to date is “Pan’s Labyrinth,” a tape heavily infused with fantasy. Despite the high bar del Toro has set for himself, he recaptures the magic of that piece in his latest offering, “The Shape of Water.” With similar themes, characters, and plot, the two can easily be compared against each other. Whereas “Pan’s Labyrinth” is grounded in a grimly realistic setting, the world of “The Shape of Water” is too heavily stylized. As a result, its cinematic impact suffers, but the film remains a beautiful and touching work nonetheless.
Set in early ‘60s Baltimore, the film follows a mute woman, Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins), who works as a janitor at a government research facility run by Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). While cleaning one day, she catches a glimpse of the facility’s prized research subject: an amphibious humanoid man, often called “The Asset” (Doug Jones). Over time, the two grow close, and Elisa helps him break out of the facility. Her coworker, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), and her best friend and neighbor, Giles (Richard Jenkins) aid Elisa in this dangerous venture.
With an established cast like this, the acting is unsurprisingly terrific. Spencer and Jenkins are the heavyweights, more than filling out their relatively minor roles. Jones’ nonverbal performance as the Amphibious Man terrifies. Shannon seems to have had a blast with this film, as he dials up the evil factor as one of the creepiest villains of his career. His Strickland is everything wrong with America in the 1960s: racist, sexist, and obsessed with power. Del Toro and Vanessa Taylor’s script is chock-full of memorable lines, and Shannon delivers the majority of them with a sneer. “You may think that thing looks human,” he says, matter-of-fact. “It stands on two legs, right? But we’re created in the Lord’s image. You don’t think that’s what the Lord looks like, do you?”
Hawkins, however, outshines them all. Despite not speaking, she is able to communicate every bit as much nuance and emotion as the rest of the cast, if not more. From her initial mousy shyness to her eventual strength and courage, every aspect of Elisa as a character can be seen in Hawkins’ eyes and smile. An actor has nothing to fall back on without dialogue, yet Hawkins never once missteps.
Another wonderful aspect of the film is the cinematography. “The Shape of Water” is gorgeous, making full use of its fantastic premise to set up unbelievable shots. One stand-out example of this is a sex scene that takes place in a room full of water. Additionally, del Toro uses transitions to hammer home water as a motif, and makes the audience very aware of the ubiquity of the element. A book, or at least a thesis, can be written about the presence of water in this film.
Although the fantastical elements make for a beautiful film, they weaken it in some respects—especially in comparison to del Toro’s earlier masterpiece. While “Pan’s Labyrinth” has strong fairy tale influences, it is also a terrifyingly accurate depiction of life after the Spanish Civil War. “The Shape of Water,” by contrast, is set in a stylized and simplified version of Cold War-era America, complete with a KGB spy and an aggressively American general. At times, it seems to be attempting to make a political point, but then undercuts the validity of that point by having unrealistic plot points or scenes (why is a janitor allowed to enter this top-secret room all the time, unsupervised? How can towels at the base of a door make a room mostly waterproof?). These implausible elements, along with a slightly overstuffed plot, weaken the film.
But it is certainly not past the point of redemption. “The Shape of Water” is a beautiful film with an incredible cast, leaving so much to love about the movie. A must-see for fans of “Pan’s Labyrinth,” or movie-lovers in general, del Toro’s latest sees him returning to his finest form for the first time in many years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Labor Relations Board ruled to certify Columbia University’s graduate student union on Dec. 16—a decision some experts and graduate students say echoes and could affect ongoing unionization efforts at Harvard.
The ruling marks the board’s second decision in favor of student unions since it reaffirmed its commitment to mandating a new unionization election at Harvard on Dec. 12.
“We’ve been celebrating with Harvard here,” said Olga Brudastova, a Columbia graduate student and union organizer.
Columbia filed objections with the NLRB last December, arguing their election—in which eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants voted in favor of unionization by a vote of 1,602 to 623—was invalid because of inconsistencies in voter ID policy and the presence of union agents at polling stations.
In its decision, the board noted that 647 challenged ballots were “an insufficient number to affect the results” of the Columbia vote.
Brudastova said having access to complete voter lists—a point of contention in Harvard’s own union election—contributed to the success of unionization at Columbia. Harvard graduate students previously charged that a voter list Harvard generated before the Nov. 2016 unionization election—the initial results of which showed more students voting against unionization than in favor—was inadequate in part because it excluded some eligible voters.
NLRB case law dictates employers must provide a complete and accurate list of eligible voters before a unionization election. University officials have said they believe the Nov. 2016 election was fair and that Harvard stands by the results of that election.
“I guess we were luckier than Harvard’s graduate workers in terms of Columbia’s cooperation with the NLRB process in getting the lists of voters,” Brudastova said. “These logistical details actually make a big difference.”
Harvard graduate student Nathaniel R. Braffman, a Columbia alumnus and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers supporter,  said he was pleased by the NLRB’s ruling in favor of Columbia.
“I’m excited and eager to see a contract negotiated between Columbia's graduate workers and the university,” he said.
Columbia union organizers presented a bargaining request to Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger’s office following the release of the NLRB’s decision, according to Brudastova.
But graduate student unions’ recent victories at Columbia and Harvard may prove short-lived. University of Michigan professor and labor law scholar Kate Andrias said the NLRB, whose five members are selected by presidential nomination, may not continue ruling in the unions’ favor after new appointments are made.
In particular, a Republican-led board would be likely to reverse its 2016 decision to recognize Columbia graduate students and teaching assistants as workers, Andrias said. That case set the most recent precedent for student unionization at private colleges and universities.
“We have no indication that, once there’s a full board, the underlying Columbia decision will be upheld,” Andrias said. “In fact, at least one of the board members—the new board members—is on record suggesting that he believes that decision should be reconsidered.”
Stanford law professor and former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV said he thinks it is probable the board will overrule the Columbia precedent once President Donald Trump replaces outgoing chairman Phillip A. Miscimarra, whose term ended Dec. 16.
“I would imagine, given the unbridled approach to previous Obama board decisions, that the Columbia University decision will be a prime candidate for reversal, especially given that the board has gone back and forth on this for decades,” Gould said.
By NLRB procedure, Harvard can hold a second unionization election only after the remaining 195 challenged ballots from last year’s election are unsealed and counted, provided the final tally does not already certify the union. The regional NLRB has yet to set a date for the unsealing and counting of the final results of the 2016 election.
Gould said a reversal of the Columbia precedent before a second election would likely imperil the unionization effort at Harvard.
“There are a lot of imponderables here: how soon the new board member will get there, that’s one, whether he has some recusal problem since he’s been in private practice, that’s another,” Gould said. “All that we can say is, if and when the board is fully reconstituted, in this area as in others, unions will be in considerable difficulty. Timing is a big part of this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard signed a memorandum of understanding with the Cuban Ministry of Higher Education Saturday to strengthen collaboration amid tense relations between the United States and Cuba under the Trump administration.
The memorandum is a formal document that promotes research partnerships through joint publications, academic conferences, and post-graduate training programs. Part of the agreement also encourages Cuban students to apply for admission to Harvard.
University Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott and Aurora Fernández, Cuba’s vice minister of higher education, officially signed the memorandum together in Havana last weekend. Several other Harvard representatives traveled with Elliott to Cuba for a ceremony held around the signing.
The new agreement comes after the White House announced additional sanctions on Cuban businesses and restrictions on travel to the country last month. Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration has moved to reverse Obama-era policies intended to normalize relations with Cuba. The Obama administration restored diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014, which had been severed in 1961 during the Cold War.
After the Trump administration's announcement, Harvard administrators affirmed the University would continue to support students conducting academic research in Cuba so long as they obtain the proper paperwork.
Erin E. Goodman, associate director of academic programs at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, said the new memorandum signals the University’s “continued commitment to welcoming Cubans to Harvard as visiting scholars and as regular students.”
According to Elliott, the renewed ties with Cuba resemble those established in a similar agreement in 2006 between Harvard and the University of Havana.
Harvard currently maintains close connections with its partner institutions in Cuba through the Rockefeller Center, which runs the Cuba Studies Program. Founded in 1999, the program facilitates scholarly exchanges and holds academic workshops, among various other activities.
The Rockefeller Center also coordinates semester-long study-abroad programs at the University of Havana every fall semester. Goodman said the center will continue to serve as the point of contact at Harvard for projects related to Cuba.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore wing Justin Bassey drove down the right side of the lane, taking a couple of dribbles before trying to bank home a layup. The shot clanged off the front of the rim, but before Boston University’s defender could collect the rebound, captain Chris Egi flew in for a putback slam.
This sequence of events led BU coach Joe Jones to storm onto the floor, confronting the official over a questionable no-call for offensive goaltending. The Terriers were quickly assessed a technical, and Bassey hit the two ensuing free throws.
So went the contest between Harvard men’s basketball and Boston University on Thursday night at Lavietes Pavilion—a well-executed offense and a commanding presence in the paint for the Crimson (5-6), and frustration for the Terriers (4-7). Harvard prevailed, 74-63, to collect its second straight victory.
“Nineteen turnovers and 13-for-20 from the foul line, not very good numbers there, but a team win and an energizing kind of win for our program with all of our kids having direct contributions,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said.
Three Harvard scorers finished in double figures on a night on which 13 players checked in, and 11 of them tallied points. Junior forward Weisner Perez and sophomore forward Seth Towns posted 12 apiece, and Bassey added 11.
The Crimson outrebounded BU, 32-26, but the disparity in the paint was larger than the rebounding totals would show. Harvard forced its way into the paint to collect defensive and offensive rebounds, despite several height advantages for the Terriers. The Crimson outscored BU in the paint by eight points, and when it did not score inside, it was able to draw contact and get to the charity stripe.
Egi’s performance was illustrative of Harvard’s paint prowess. The senior, who made his season debut in this game, tallied eight points and four rebounds in just 18 minutes of action. Two of his four baskets were dunks, and he missed just one shot.
“His leadership on the court and the energy he brought, whether it’s him scoring or someone else scoring, he’s uplifting, and I feed off that, everyone else feeds off that, and kudos to him,” Perez said. “It was crucial tonight.”
In the opening minutes of the first half, Amaker went with some of his typical reserves as his starting five. The 11-year veteran coach penciled in Andre Chatfield, Robbie Feinberg, Zach Yoshor, Perez, and Egi at tipoff.
“I was not pleased and happy with how we were practicing, but we made a statement that the guys who deserved it at that point in time were going to start, and that was the group that did,” Amaker said. “They started the second half, and each time they started they gave us the shot in the arm, the lift we needed.”
Perez was the driving force behind the Crimson’s early lead, as he connected on his first five attempts. In his second career start, the junior finished the game with 12 points and seven rebounds.
Egi and Perez, who had just 11 minutes of playing time entering the contest, were key factors in Harvard’s win. The duo missed just three of their combined 12 shots, and the rest of the Crimson followed the veterans’ lead. Harvard shot 55.3 percent from the field—45.0 percent from three-point range—and this shooting efficiency paid dividends.
Three-point shooting has been a thorn in the Crimson’s side in the early stages of this season. However, the hosts took advantage of the Terriers’ zone defense and shot 9-for-20 on three-point attempts.
“I know our staff, our assistants in particular, really put in extra work with our guys to get shots up, and it’s nice to see that that work is paying off,” Amaker said. “As I’ve said all along, we should be a better shooting team than we displayed previously.”
Aside from converting layups and hitting threes with regularity, Harvard managed to score in nearly every way possible against BU. On one second-half possession, a Terrier defender cut freshman guard Rio Haskett’s drive short. He faked a scoop shot with his left hand, spun, and hit a midrange jumper while twisting around in midair.
The Crimson’s ball movement and patience were major factors in its high shooting percentage. Harvard was content with swinging the ball around the perimeter and waiting for openings to arise in BU’s zone defense rather than forcing low-percentage shots. However, several times the Crimson waited a tick too long and incurred shot clock violations.
On one second half possession, for example, Harvard passed up several mediocre shot opportunities. Towns ended up with the ball and space in the paint, and he connected on a one-legged jumper from just inside the free throw line.
The Crimson’s ball control was not perfect, however. The hosts lost the turnover battle after exhibiting poise in the opening minutes. Harvard turned the ball over 11 times in the first half, which led to half of the Terriers’ first period points coming off turnovers. In total, the Crimson gave the ball up 19 times to BU’s 16.
The Terriers’ half-court press flummoxed Harvard ball handlers on multiple occasions. Near the end of the opening period, junior guard Corey Johnson found himself trapped on the sideline, which forced an errant pass over a leaping Christian Juzang.
Defensively, the Crimson’s zone and man schemes stymied BU’s offensive game plan.
“When I watched, it was one of the things that I was concerned about because we hadn’t seen so much zone,” Jones said. “I thought we got good looks. I thought we got forced into some quick ones more in their man than anything else where we went for a post up and we took a quick shot. We didn’t show any poise at all.”
This two-three zone kept the top scoring Terrier, Cedric Hankerson, quiet throughout the night. The senior had averaged 13.6 points per game in prior appearances, but he shot just two-for-nine, and he was forced to take multiple unappealing looks from beyond the arc.
BU made up for Hankerson’s misses with efficiency from other scorers. Tyler Scanlon, Will Goff, and Max Mahoney combined to shoot 9-of-11 in the first half for 22 points.
An aggressive Harvard defense allowed the Terriers to stay in contention in the first half. The Crimson committed seven fouls compared to just three for Boston University, and the visitors capitalized by hitting six free throws to the Harvard’s zero.
In the second half, the foul and free throw numbers evened out. Neither team impressed at the line, as BU hit 15 of 24 attempts and Harvard went 13-for-20.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supported by stellar rebounding and strong offensive play, Harvard women’s basketball posted a 1-1 record this week in the Hilton Garden Inn Classic at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, Florida.
The Crimson (6-5) outrebounded its opponents, Florida Gulf Coast and Akron, 113-67, in the tournament, posting season highs in rebounds in both games. Senior guard Taylor Rooks, who led the team in scoring in both games, and sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm were both selected to the all-tournament team.
“This weekend we really pushed through the bubble rebounding,” Rooks said. “We boxed out preemptively and and really crashed the offensive boards hard.”
HARVARD 76, AKRON 63
In its second contest of the tournament, Harvard bested the Zips (6-5) 76-63 in the first ever meeting between the two schools behind strong rebounding and a quick start. The Crimson’s 26 first quarter points set a season high for points in a quarter.
“Against Akron, we played a little bit tougher and a little bit angrier and a little bit more determined, and it showed itself,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
Early in the game, junior guard Madeline Raster drilled a three-pointer, one of her two in the first period, to make the game 7-5 in Harvard’s favor. Although the contest had yet to see three minutes pass, the Crimson would not relinquish this lead throughout the rest of the game.
Harvard dominated the glass, out-rebounding Akron 57-34. This marked a season high for rebounds in a single game by the Crimson. Freshman forward Jadyn Bush led the charge off the bench, grabbing a team-leading 14 rebounds for Harvard.
“We have so many talented rebounders on this team,” Boehm said. “Rebounding hasn’t been something we’ve always been great with, but we work on it every day in practice relentlessly, and it’s great to see it pay off.”
Yet again, the Crimson turned the ball over more times than its opponent, giving the ball away 17 times to the Zips’ nine. However, the capitalization on these turnovers proved key. Akron was only able to turn these turnovers into 11 points, while Harvard took advantage of these opportunities by scoring 14 points off of the Zips’ turnovers.
The Crimson continued its offensive attack into the second quarter, shooting 59 percent from the field in the quarter. Harvard went into the half with a 13-point lead in control of the game. At one point in the fourth quarter, the Crimson led by 21 points, up 70-49 for its largest lead of the game.
Harvard closed out the game and tournament with strong defense by eventually taking the game, 76-63.
FLORIDA GULF COAST 65, HARVARD 56
In a closely contested matchup, a late surge by FGCU (12-3) allowed the Eagles to top the Crimson. With just over one minute remaining in the contest, a tough FGCU defense and strong free-throw shooting allowed the hosts to prevail, 65-56.
“We played a really tough 38 minutes, but the last few minutes we made a few mistakes and handed them the game,” sophomore guard Katie Benzan said. “It was frustrating and irritating to give them the game like that.”
Neither team led by more than 10 points the entire game, as the back-and-forth affair remained tight until the final minute when the Eagles finally pulled away. Harvard’s late fourth quarter 8-0 run, its second of the game, gave them the lead, but a flurry of lead changes led to a tug-of-war that ended in FGCU’s favor.
Although the Eagles led by double digits twice, the Crimson continued to chip away at the lead each time to keep the contest close. Despite Rooks’s third double-double performance of the year in which she scored 16 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, Harvard was unable to cut the deficit a final time at the end of the game.
Led by Rooks, the Crimson outrebounded FGCU by a margin of 56-33, its highest rebound total on the season before topping it the next day against Akron. However, the difference ultimately came in the turnover department, as Harvard gave the ball away 20 times, resulting in 15 points off of those turnovers for the Eagles.
“Twenty turnovers against Florida Gulf Coast, they’re a really good team.” Delaney-Smith said. “You can’t have twenty turnovers and think you’re going to do anything, and we still almost won the game.”
In the second quarter, FGCU pulled ahead 27-17, but the Crimson stormed back with an 8-0 run to keep the game close at the break with the Eagles leading 29-25 at the half.
Earlier in the first quarter, FGCU had an 8-0 run of their own to take an early 18-10 lead, but the Eagles’ streak was snapped on a three-pointer on the right wing from Raster.
With just over a minute and a half left in the game, junior guard Sydney Skinner made a layup to give Harvard a 56-55 lead, but these would be the Crimson’s final points of the contest. FGCU would take the lead just seven seconds later and would hold onto this lead, securing its 65-56 win.
