After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bracket makers take note: this past Tuesday the University of Connecticut’s women’s basketball team won their 72nd straight game, beating West Virginia by a whopping 28 points. The lopsided outcome was nothing new for this team, which has averaged a 32.5-point margin of victory during their record-setting streak. Although these juggernauts have clearly displayed their dominance in this particular season, the question remains: Are they the greatest ever? Some talking heads profess that they will be if they win the national championship at the end of this season, others doubt whether this team could contend with the 2001-2003 UConn team that won 70 straight. No matter which stance an onlooker takes, the argument illustrates the absence of an agreed-upon definition of ultimate value in sports. This problem is nothing new.
In the early 1980s, the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre related a similar concern on a broader level; although we rate many things “good” or “bad” and pretend to operate as if we have absolute definitions these values, we in fact we have none. Therefore, in “After Virtue,” MacIntyre implores humanity to create agreed-upon laws based on rational virtues. Without such standards, issues of conflicting values reign. Sports as usual represent a microcosm of this dilemma. UConn’s team may have won more consecutive games than any other women’s team, but is this the mark by which greatness is awarded? If UConn loses in this year’s championship game to a team who is riding a mere 11-game win streak, would they still be considered deserving of the trophy or the title “best team”? This scenario only scratches the surface of the collective dissonance held in sports by competing measures of worth.
The Olympics is the mecca of sporting controversy, and it is precisely because its system of values is not standardized or agreed upon. Countries compete unofficially for the highest medal count, but should total medals count more than type? Although the United States won a record 37 medals at last month’s Vancouver games, they won five fewer gold medals than Canada; should silver and bronze medals have put our nation in the lead?
These debates become even more confusing when trying to designate an athlete as the “greatest Olympians.” In 2008, Michael Phelps wowed the world by capturing eight gold medals in the swimming events he competed in, quickly garnering him that title. But from another perspective, this is hardly fair based on the Olympic structure. There is little doubt that Phelps is the greatest swimmer of our time, but swimming allows for many more medal opportunities than other sports. How can it be fair to reason that Phelps is greater than an Olympic volleyball player, who has only one medal to compete for playing. If both athletes win all of the medals they were able to compete for, naming Phelps the greatest reveals its conditional meaning.
What ensues in the sporting world where no standards of excellence or value are set aside is plurality of honor and accomplishment. Awards in the NBA are given to the best non-starter (sixth man award), and in the Olympics athletes are dubbed “most decorated” even if they have failed to win a gold medal. During the 2002 World Series the MLB unveiled their top 10 “most memorable moments” with the top moment going to Carl Ripken Jr. playing the most consecutive games of all time.
And so the beat will go on in sports, like morality, as more teams, players, and coaches are deemed “the best this” and “the greatest that” while absolute worth remains to be defined. Such praise should not continue to be given without serious reflection. In the age where the specific virtues in our morals are increasingly harder to pinpoint, in our sports there exist infinite bests by infinite definitions. UConn will most likely win this year’s NCAA tournament, but that’s but one marker of achievement.

To the editors:
In the Feb. 24, 2010, editorial comment “Risky Business,” Lea J. Hachigian argues that much of today’s gender gap in salary levels and other areas is the result of “the failure of females to seek out and take necessary risks.” The solution, she argues, is to change our expectations of girls’ behavior in childhood in order to encourage them to grow into brave, risk-taking adult women (who aren’t afraid to ask for a raise). While changing societal expectations about girls’ capabilities is certainly something to be promoted, there are aspects of the relationship between women and risk-taking that Hachigian’s analysis fails to capture.
If women in general do not aggressively negotiate their salaries, this is in part due to the reality that they are often viewed negatively for such behavior. Research shows that people expect women to “play nice” and often punish them for aggressive or “risky” behavior that would go unnoticed or even rewarded in men. While Hachigian suggests that what needs to change is girls’ willingness to “seek out and take necessary risks,” it is far more necessary that society as a whole learns to see women and girls as appropriate agents of risk-taking.
To take one topical example: When you turned on your TV this past February to watch the 2010 Winter Olympics, one athlete you didn’t see was the world record-holder for ski jumping on Vancouver’s K95 hill, Lindsey Van. That’s because since 1998 the International Olympics Committee has refused every request to admit Women’s Ski Jumping as a recognized Olympic sport, while Men’s Ski Jumping has been included in the Olympics since the first modern games in 1924. In 2005, Gian Franco Kasper, a member of the IOC, said that ski jumping “seems not to be appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view.” (In other words, the IOC’s expectations of appropriate behavior for women doesn’t include speeding 60 mph along a ramp and flying dozens of meters through the air on a pair of skis.)
Lindsey Van and plenty of other girls and women are out there taking risks on a daily basis, necessary or otherwise. What we ought to be asking ourselves is why we as a society continually fail to reward them for doing so.

To the editors:
I was extremely disappointed that The Harvard Crimson published a book review (“Studying ‘American Pastoral’ to Understand ‘The Road,’” Theodore J. Gioia, Feb. 23, 2010) written by a reviewer who had not even finished the book! It is completely unacceptable for any newspaper, especially one associated with an academic institution, to publish such a review.
“American Pastoral” is my favorite novel of all time, and Theo grossly oversimplified a very small portion of it. Philip Roth does anything but portray the American Dream and suburban life as a straightforward, dismal existence. Perhaps if the reviewer had read further, he would have appreciated the Swede’s reaction to his daughter blowing up the local post office. Roth definitely explores the “inner and outer lives of the father and [daughter],” for which Theo praises Cormac McCarthy.
Instead of sensing an “aftertaste of tired irony,” I was deeply affected by Roth’s novel and have reflected on it for years after my first reading. Coincidently, I began to read McCarthy’s “The Road” and never finished it; however, I would never write a review without completing it. Give “American Pastoral” a chance and don’t be so lazy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Moderation is a fatal thing. Nothing succeeds like excess.” If Oscar Wilde was right about that, then perhaps this year’s River Run will have been the most dangerous yet.  This year, the “supposed tradition that involves drinking a lot of alcohol in the courtyard of the Houses along the Charles River” (to quote the email sent to freshmen by the office of Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67) featured police cars guarding the exits to the Yard and the entrances to upperclass houses. Freshmen reported having their swipe access to upperclass houses deactivated. Boat-burning was verboten. Some students went so far as to perform the annual “ritual” a day in advance to avoid administrative sanctions.
But what’s wrong with excessive, sometimes dangerous alcohol consumption? We are young. As a 21-year-old, I know for a fact that I am invincible. Every day, on my way to class, I jump out of two planes and yell rude things at heavily armed strangers. I only sleep on Wednesdays. Once I gave myself consumption just to see what the fuss was about. That’s what youth is for.
So why all the uproar over excessive alcohol consumption? Certainly there are medical risks. But if it weren’t for the alcohol poisoning, who would visit UHS? I recently checked in with an intense, stabbing earache and by the time I was called out of the waiting room to be seen, my biggest problem was old age.
Admittedly, alcohol destroys brain cells. But what do we need those brain cells for? Class? Dating? Both are largely restricted to a few physics concentrators whom you can see linking arms as they stroll towards the Science Center. I suppose we could use them to write the Great American Novel, but Hemingway seems to have had no problem doing that, and he drank like a fish who was trying to give itself liver failure.
Then again, I suppose we should be worrying about the future. What if we want to run for president? Actually, come to think of it, if there’s one legacy Barack Obama has left America, it’s that it’s okay to experiment with illegal, dangerous substances—as long as you write an eloquent memoir about it afterwards.
Besides, regardless of what Harvard would have us believe, excessive drinking is not the exclusive province of the class of 2013. It goes back at least until the 1920s. The last words of the poet Dylan Thomas were, “I’ve had eighteen straight whiskies. I think that’s the record.”
And of course the train continues. Drinking pervades Shakespeare—Falstaff, Sir Toby Belch, among others. There’s even a character who blacks out; in “Othello,” Cassio acknowledges that, “I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore.” Admittedly, after this, he loses his job and his reputation, but—considering that everyone else in the play is murdered, arrested, commits suicide, or was a minor character to begin with—he comes out of it rather well.
But many of history’s dipsomaniacs were geniuses. Winston Churchill—another famous drinker who once proclaimed that “I have taken more out of alcohol than it has taken out of me”—was often extremely rude to his servants. “Yes,” he replied when confronted, “but I am a great man.” Can we use the same excuse? Recently, I tried to rewrite “The Great Gatsby” by replacing all the characters with cats, but I only got about three pages into Catsby’s doomed love before my left eye began twitching uncontrollably and I had to lie down. Maybe we’re not quite there yet. Until that day comes, do we have license to drink like Fitzgerald? Or are we going too far?
That seems to be the worry when it comes to the class of 2013, with their unprecedentedly high number of alcohol-related hospitalizations. But how to monitor this sort of thing?
“Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?” So inquires Sir Toby Belch of the teetotaling steward Malvolio in Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night.” As Sir Toby realized, people will find ways to quench their thirsts, with or without official approval. If freshmen want to run around the river burning boats and taking shots, even police presence will only go so far to stop them. People have to want to drink in moderation. Some are born moderate, some achieve moderation, and some have moderation thrust upon them. For the class of 2013, it has been mostly the latter.
Of course, DAPA informs me that four-fifths of Harvard students only drink three to five shots one-eighth of the time, or something like that. Unfortunately, I only respond to peer pressure when I can figure out the fractions involved or when it is yelling at me to drink mead from a vat. Perhaps Harvard should distribute water bottles with slogans that speak more to student concerns, with things like: “If you suddenly think that your childhood was intensely interesting and feel an irresistible urge to tell people about it, stop drinking,” or “Never take advice from someone drunker than you,” or, “If you feel compelled to explain to people that you’re still in full possession of your faculties, you no longer are.”

A recent study co-authored by Harvard Medical School Professor Rudolph E. Tanzi has found that a protein once believed to have no other function except playing a key role in Alzheimer’s disease may actually be beneficial to the immune system.
Tanzi and colleagues discovered similarities in function between the Alzheimer’s disease-related protein beta-amyloid, or A-beta, and LL-37, a well-known protein found in the first line of defense in the immune system.
“This finding gives us a strong inkling of what [A-beta] is doing and can provide us with some clues, not only about the origin of the disease, but also how to think about it therapeutically,” said Lee E. Goldstein, one of the study’s co-authors and a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine. “It’s likely that A-beta plays an important protective role in our health, in addition to being what was once considered a ‘bad peptide.’”
In some cases, researchers found that A-beta was more effective as an anti-microbial protein than LL-37. But Medical School professor and study co-author Robert D. Moir said that researchers need to now focus on making sure the findings on the beneficial function of A-beta apply to actual people.
“This study was done in a test tube,” Moir said. “We have to show in vivo that it does in fact work.”
Moir added that the laboratory was now examining the relationship between A-beta levels in live animals and their susceptibility to infections. The study’s researchers said they believe that their surprising discovery of a new function for A-beta has implications in the search for new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.
“Proteins don’t have a moral valence. They have functions that are either adaptive or not and it just functions differently in different settings,” Goldstein said. “Now that we understand the settings better and are consequently in a better position to understand how to treat and modulate, the protein may be providing some protective function and important biological functions that we previously didn’t appreciate.”
Moir said that this study has stirred more interest in the role of pathogens in Alzheimer’s disease among other researchers.
“We have discovered a function for this thing that everybody thought was just ‘junk’ and it has opened into whole new potential strategies for treating disease,” he said.
Goldstein also mentioned the debunking of earlier theories about A-beta as one of the significant contributions of his research.
“Overturning dogma is a way of shedding light and moving the field forward,” he said. “Following informed instinct and not following dogma is a cherished thing to keep untarnished.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite Wednesday evening’s enfeebled river run, students displayed the same unfettered exuberance as in previous years when they awoke early the next morning for Housing Day.
Upperclassmen, eager to demonstrate their House spirit, marched into Harvard Yard yesterday adorned in their respective Houses’ shirts, accompanied by an assortment of mascots from the animal kingdom—polar bears, lions, moose, and more. From Pforzheimer House’s sunglass-wearing Quadlings, to Dunster House’s antler-clad supporters, House pride was on display by 8 a.m. Members of Mather House climbed atop the John Harvard statue, while Adams House residents donned suit jackets in preparation for the day’s festivities.
The sound of students rallying around University Hall—the administrative hub of the College and the location of the John Harvard Statue—could be heard throughout the Yard. Students were so loud that Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said she left her office yesterday morning to go find a quieter location to work.
While upperclassmen waited to receive the envelopes from the administration that contained the names of their new members, a coterie of first-years took to the Yard to see what was going on.
Aaron J. Deutsch ’13 was among the freshmen who left their dorms and made thier way out onto the Yard.
While the anticipation and excitement in the air was palpable, Deutsch would not say what House he hoped to see arrive at his door.
“I am not going to divulge it for fear of jinxing my blocking group,” he said.
According to Harvard Facebook, Deutsch is now a member of Kirkland House.
Envelopes in hand, upperclassmen headed off to inform freshmen of their fates, expecting to be received with excitement.
When one future Quincy House resident did not answer, a member of the greeting party said to the closed door, “You’re a bum.”
After receiving their Housing Day assignments, many freshmen were quick to announce it online by changing their Google chat and Facebook statuses and e-mailing clubs’ mailing lists.
By 11 a.m., Houses had positioned themselves outside Annenberg Hall—blasting music, holding signs, and chanting.
When freshmen made their way inside, they were immediately greeted by a collection of exuberant upperclassmen ready to give out House swag.
Winthrop House gave freshmen cartons of Tropicana orange juice to fit with the theme of their t-shirts, which turn Tropicana into Thropicana.
William R.T. McMillan ’13, who was placed in Quincy House, said he was already looking forward to giving out housing assignments next year.
About to embark on spring break, McMillan said he was glad to finally know his Housing assignment: “It’s been weighing pretty heavily.”

Tamily Weissman, a concentration advisor for neurobiology and lecturer on molecular and cellular biology, was honored with the fourth annual Spark Award last night at the culminating event of Women’s Week 2010.
Weissman was selected for the award, bestowed annually by Women in Science at Harvard-Radcliffe, on the basis of her contributions to the field of neurobiology and for her role mentoring and inspiring students at Harvard.
“She is wonderful as an advisor and has a personal interest in all her students,” said Francesca R.L. Reindel ’11, secretary of WISHR. “I think having a ceremony to honor an inspiring role model can bring women in science together as a community and motivate us to move forward.”
At the banquet, Weissman spoke about the difficulty of finding a balance between work and personal life, particularly in a largely male-dominated field.
“There were times I felt I had to prove myself more than the men around me, and they took me more seriously once they realized I was smart and capable too,” she said.
Weissman added that women have made great strides in scientific disciplines in recent years, but noted that there are still significantly fewer female tenured professors. At the same time, she cautioned that simply adhering to the traditional metrics of success is not the path for everyone.
“We women should not feel as though we are the ones failing if we do not achieve a certain level of prescribed success,” she said. “We need to embrace, not criticize, both men and women when they think about doing something nontraditional.”
Reindel said that Weissman’s honesty was refreshing.
“You don’t always hear about following something that really makes you happy instead of following an external point of success,” she said.
“I think it’s important for undergraduates to recognize that.”
Several of the week’s events focused on negotiating among career, family, and other parts of women’s lives.
Members of various women’s groups agreed that “Clocks: A Conversation on Balancing a Career with a Life,” along with the Spark Award Banquet, was particularly inspiring.
Elizabeth A.T. McLeod ’10, president of the Seneca—which co-sponsored the week’s events with the Harvard College Women’s Center—said that the events had sparked informal conversations among students about the issues discussed during the week.
“It’s a blast seeing the community of Harvard women coming together year after year,” she said. “Women’s Week is a time for building friendships and sharing ideas in a way that I think carries over to the rest of the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 50 members of the Harvard Mind/Brain/Behavior community gathered in the Harvard-Yenching Library yesterday afternoon to hear biological anthropology professor Richard W. Wrangham explain how the cultural invention of cooking food has contributed to human evolution.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, which regards cooking as biologically unimportant, Wrangham said that cooking’s contribution to the evolution of human beings cannot be overlooked.
Wrangham explained that humans have adapted physiologically to eating cooked foods.
Human guts are too small to digest nutritionally poor plant matter and human molars are too small for tough raw foods, Wrangham said.
In order to prove the importance of cooking, Wrangham said he only knows of one person who lived longer than just a few weeks on raw food.
This individual, who was kidnapped in Brazil but managed to escape, survived on bananas for weeks.
Cooked protein is more digestible, explained Wrangham, and people obtain more calories from cooked food than from the same quantity of raw food.
He explained that the extra energy people gain from eating cooked food has allowed for larger brains.
“The effect of meat changing the size of people’s brain was interesting,” said Nathan Cooke, a documentarian for the MIT D-Lab.
Wrangham’s new book “Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human," published in May 2009, delves further into the implications of cooking food.
In the book, Wrangham argues that this technological development could even be responsible for the division of labor between men and women.
Wrangham has been a Currier House Master since 2008.
He also teaches a number of courses on biological anthropology at the College, including Freshman Seminar 46o: The Evolutionary Significance of Cooking.
“His research in human evolutionary biology is something that our students have enjoyed hearing about in the past in our junior symposium,” said Shawn C. Harriman, Educational Program Coordinator of the Mind/Brain/Behavior program,  “This is an opportunity for the larger Harvard community to hear about his most recent work and his most recent book.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 30 students dine together around at a long wooden table every night at 6:30 p.m., helping themselves to communal dishes of homemade vegetarian cuisine and freshly baked bread.
Above the doorway to the dining room, the instructions “Don’t spit in the soup—we’ve all got to eat” are painted in an elaborate cursive script.
The Dudley Co-operative Society has been dishing up home-cooked food since 1958, when it was established as an alternative housing option at the University.
The Co-op, which is a ten-minute walk from Harvard Square, is divided between two clapboard 19th-century Victorian houses on Mass. Ave.
Martin Eiermann ’10, a co-president of the Co-op, says he objects to his title.
“We’re pretty anti-hierarchical here,” he says as he sits in the Co-op’s library, which evokes the organization’s historic connections to Harvard’s liberal underground.
According to Eiermann, student protesters hatched some of their plans in the late 1960s—including the 1969 takeover of University Hall—in the safety of the Co-op.
Joining the Co-op—one division of Dudley House, a community for students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as well as a small number of undergraduates—or renting an apartment allow students to escape on-campus living. Despite common perceptions that living off campus is difficult, costly (especially in the Boston area), and lonely, students who have left the Houses say that the rewards of independent living outweigh the occasional inconveniences.
A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY
In terms of Harvard housing, Jennie M. D’Amico ’10 has seen it all: House life, the Dudley Co-op, and an apartment near Central Square that she shares with her fiance, a dental school student at Boston University.
She and her roommate were placed in Cabot, but they left when they were taken off the Co-op’s wait list in their junior year.
According to Joshua G. McIntosh, associate dean of Harvard College for student life, approximately 100 undergraduates choose to live off campus every year—either at the Co-op or in an apartment of their own.
About 30 juniors and seniors canceled their housing contracts this past year to move off campus for either a semester or the whole year, and five to 10 upperclassmen submitted relocation forms to the Dudley Co-op.
D’Amico describes her time in the Co-op as “the first time I felt like I belonged to a real community at Harvard.”
Just before her senior year, D’Amico moved into an apartment near the Co-op with her boyfriend. Now, they share an apartment in Central Square because they wanted their own space, she says.
It is a sentiment shared by others who chose to find off-campus housing.
Roy Cohen ’10, a former Eliot House resident who moved into an apartment near Inman Square this year after spending the fall semester in Argentina, says that his experiences overseas changed his perspective on living spaces.
“Up until junior year, I loved the dorms,” he says. “It was really about needing my own space, my own room, and living with people who want that, too.”
MEALTIME TRADE-OFFS
Despite popular belief, living off campus is sometimes cheaper than living in a House.
Harvard’s Financial Aid Office awards financial aid by default with the College’s room and board fees included.
Students at the Co-op pay room fees to the College, while they pay their board fees to the Co-op. According to Co-op co-president Megan A. Shutzer ’10, a Crimson editorial writer, board fees to the Co-op are significantly less than what the College charges.
“Living in an apartment and buying and preparing my own food is also much cheaper than living on campus,” D’Amico says. “Also, the Co-op buys in bulk, so you’re getting a lot for your dollar there.”
Although apartment living may seem like a breath of fresh air for students annoyed with House rules, D’Amico mentions that apartment living is not always so easy. It involves many responsibilities that the Houses automatically fulfill, she says.
In exchange for a cheaper board fee, Co-op students lose swipe access to all Harvard dining halls.
“But my fiancé and I pick up each other’s slack when one of us is really busy or stressed out—such as now, when I’m finishing my senior thesis,” D’Amico says. “And I always like what’s on the menu!”
LIVING IN ISOLATION?
A common concern among students is the possibility that alternative housing isolates students from the Harvard undergraduate community.
In an e-mailed statement, McIntosh describes the Houses as “the epicenter of the undergraduate experience.”
“A House plays a much larger role than simply serving as a place to sleep and eat,” McIntosh writes. “It is difficult to separate the Harvard College experience from the residential experience.”
Despite his off-campus address, Cohen—who started college at 22 after finishing mandatory military service in the Israeli army—says that his ties to the Eliot House community did not weaken after his move to Inman Square.
“[The move] helped me in a way to reconnect to my House environment,” he says. “Now, I’m actually in Eliot quite a lot. I’m actually more socially involved now than I was.”
In order to ensure that off-campus students still feel like part of the community, the Office of Student Life lets off-campus residents who have lived in a House for two semesters stay affiliated with their House, McIntosh notes.
According to McIntosh, students who move off campus right after freshman year are automatically affiliated with Dudley House.
JOINING THE CLUB
Zoe O. Tucker ’13, a current Hollis resident says that she knew she wanted to live in the Co-op even before she came to Harvard. Her friend Josh Neff ’07-’08 sang the Co-op’s praises while they were traveling together in India during her gap year.
“Appreciating food and community is important to me,” she says. “Although that’s done in a different way in Houses, I don’t feel like I get much out of eating in dining halls, in an anonymous, trough-style way.”
But since the Co-op only has room for 32 students, there is an application process for living in the facility.
Interested students add their names to a waiting list, have dinner in the Co-op, attend an informal information session, and wait to be notified of the Co-op’s decision.
According to Shutzer, who lived in Leverett House her sophomore fall, it usually takes one to two semesters to be admitted to the Co-op.
Tucker is currently on the Co-op’s wait list but was sorted into Currier with her blocking group.
“I’ll definitely go to a House and be happy about it,” she says, “as long as it’s not for three years.”
A co-operative living arrangement may seem like a strange choice to many Harvard students, but that is not necessarily the case at peer institutions, Eiermann says.
“In a way, it’s bizarre that Harvard has only one of these,” he says. “Berkeley has hundreds.”

For Harvard Law School students, navigating the tough job market this year is a bit like a typical plane ride—there may be some turbulence, but no crash landing— at least, according to Assistant Dean of Career Services Mark A. Weber.
“There has been a lot of uncertainty and unknowns,” Weber says. “But the outcome has not been nearly as bad as everyone thought it would be, and that’s a good thing.”
The economy’s woes in the past two years have trickled down to the nation’s top law firms, which have had to significantly reduce the number of entry-level hires. The changed legal job market—complete with job deferrals, offer rescindments, and reduced salaries—has upped the anxiety level among Law School students, many of whom had anticipated multiple offers and relative job security upon graduation.
Though the worst of the job market troubles may have passed, students and faculty alike remain cautious in their outlook on job prospects—Law School professor John C.P. Goldberg forecasts this year and next year as being “particularly tough.”
“Some 2Ls still do not have jobs for the summer, or just got news of that they have been deferred, which is causing a lot of stress,” second year Law School student Jason C. Murray says. “I think students are still pretty nervous.”
But the apprehension about jobs is largely unfounded, according to the Law School’s Office of Career Services, which estimates that between 92 to 95 percent of students seeking employment will have a job lined up by graduation.
This rate is consistent with the data for employment at graduation for the past 20 years. And the OCS says it predicts an even better job market next fall.
But the unease and uncertainty left in the wake of the financial downturn in the fall of 2008 have shifted students’ career focus and expectations, ushering in many small changes in the resources and hiring process that the OCS organizes.
CASTING A WIDER NET
In light of uncertain job prospects, students looking for employment in the private sector have been forced to expand the geographic scope of their job search.
Students who originally only considered firms in Washington, D.C. or New York have had to look at other cities across the country, Law School professor Mark V. Tushnet said.
“There used to be a sense of entitlement among students that they could work wherever they wanted to,” Murray says.
But in a post-recession world, students are returning to their home cities or are looking at smaller firms.
The OCS has also been pushing students to be more open-minded and realistic about their prospects.
According to Weber, the OCS has begun to focus its efforts on cities that have not typically been “core markets”—Denver, Seattle, and Minneapolis for example.
Along with other factors, the recession has also driven more students to seek out opportunities overseas than ever before, said HLS Professor David B. Wilkins.
“If you go to China, you don’t feel like there’s a recession,” he said. “There’s something of a paradigm shift going on here and it’s tied to the shift in the global economy.”
Wilkins estimates that in the last 10 years, student interest in working abroad after graduation increased from 5 percent to about 25 percent—which he attributes to students’ more advanced language skills and prior experiences abroad.
But for some students with families or other considerations, the decision to uproot is not to be taken lightly, and they may face additional obstacles in securing a position.
“If you have mobility, then it is a lot easier to find a job,” Goldberg said.
CHANGING PRIORITIES
The economic downturn and its effects on the legal hiring market have prompted students to reflect on their career interests and priorities. With no guarantee of a position at a big law firm, students have become more likely to enter public service directly after graduation.
Law School Student Government President Brian T. Aune says that the tougher legal job market was “an impetus” for him to take a job in the public sector the summer after his second year.
This summer position ultimately led him to decide to work in public service after graduation.
Jackson says he believes that the increase in students looking at government jobs—at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—might also reflect enthusiasm for the Obama administration.
But other students say their friends have viewed public sector jobs as a backup plan—for instance, if they failed to receive offers from desirable firms or if their start dates were deferred due to budgeting constraints.
Courtship applications are up this year, and Aune says he thinks it might be due to deferrals, since “people need something to do for a year.”
Third year Law School student Sarah E. Sorscher says she felt “very lucky” to land her clerkship next year.
Sorcher says that though her fiancé has credentials that would ordinarily make him a very competitive candidate, he had difficulty getting a clerkship, and ultimately settled for one that was not in his area of interest.
Weber notes that all jobs in the public sector are just as difficult to get in the current market.
“It is dangerous to look at [public service] as a fallback,” Weber says. “Sometimes it is even harder to get a job in the public sector because there are so many cutbacks in federal, state, and local budgets.”
Students who do choose to take positions in private firms are more conscious of their financial statuses, according to first year Law School student Sarah E. Davis.
“Students are looking more carefully at the firms’ structure to see how they will last through the economic crisis,” Davis said. “There is more awareness of firms’ relationship to the economy.”
Finding careers during a tough economic period has taught students not to simply take “the path of least resistance,” Jackson says.
In past years, students tend to focus on certain markets because that is “what everyone else is doing,” Weber says.
Now that the job search requires more effort, though, students spent more time mulling over their actual interests.
“The silver lining,” Davis says, “is that more people will be forced to use their skills to do something meaningful and beneficial for the world.”
And ultimately, students will be happier, Dein says.
“If you can’t do what makes you money, then you have to do what you enjoy!” she says.
FINE-TUNING THE PROCESS
Law firms’ responses to the economic downturn have spurred adjustments at the OCS, which saw the need to respond to the difficulties students faced in the 2008-2009 hiring cycle.
For the first time, the OCS launched an Early Interview Program, in which applicants for full-time positions interview in August along with roughly 75 percent of law schools across the country, rather than in late September after other schools finish the recruiting process.
Stanford and Yale have also recently moved to an earlier interview schedule.
Though the new schedule requires students to return to campus early, Weber says he believes that most students appreciated finishing their interviews before classes began.
In the past, other schools’ interview schedules were not a serious concern, Weber says.
But in a more difficult economy, firms have trouble predicting their needs and subsequently hire only students they interviewed earlier in the fall.
“A lot of these firms meant to hold spaces for our students,” Weber says. “But by the time our students interviewed, the slots had been filled.”
According to Wilkins, the recession has also pushed firms to move away from the “lock-step” model of promoting associates on a regular schedule, requiring instead that they demonstrate “competency.”
This could also disrupt the normal hiring process for new recruits, Wilkins says, since entry-level positions may not open up with the same regularity.
The OCS has aggressively launched new initiatives and created new resources for struggling students, Weber says.
In an effort to increase the number of avenues students have to find jobs, the OCS has begun utilizing technology to connect students to opportunities.
The OCS records weekly podcasts with a unique focus each week, created a virtual map of the United States with firms scattered across the country, and uses Twitter to post job leads and opportunities in real time for students still on the market.
“We’re leveraging technology to assist our students as best we can. It’s a new generation,” Weber says.
According to Weber, the OCS has begun to reach out directly to Law School alumni at the firms, sending books of students’ resumes to firms to assist second and third year students who are still on the job market.
Last summer, the OCS started a mock interview program to prepare students for the job search process.
The OCS also expanded its spring recruiting session.
Though in the past the spring session was predominantly aimed at first year students, in the past two years, second and third year students have also begun to take advantage of the new program.
“We knew the market would be challenging, and we wanted to make sure students were putting their best foot forward,” Weber says.
Though some students have struggled to find jobs, they say they are aware that Harvard students have been insulated from the worst of the economic turmoil.
“We are lucky enough to be at this school—people will want Harvard lawyers even during bad times,” Dein says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wendy S. Kopp, founder and chief executive officer of Teach For America, described her personal experience with the increasingly competitive program that places recent college graduates as teachers in low-income communities to an audience at the Institute of Politics last night.
Kopp first conceived of the program in 1989 as her Princeton senior thesis, in which she proposed a model of an organization that would work toward eliminating educational inequality.
Kopp said she was concerned by the less aggressive recruitment in the public sector as she saw many of her peers go to work on Wall Street.
But she said she felt it was important for the future leaders of the public sector to work with low-income communities as their first experience after college.
“I remember in Philadelphia, the public high school system is one of the country’s most challenging,” said Kopp, reflecting on the early years of TFA.
Kopp said that the organization she started with a $10 million dollar budget. It has now grown to have a budget of $200 million.
Kopp said that while economic background no longer determines educational background for some students, the challenge is making that true on a system-wide level.
With only over 4,000 individuals accepted out of over 35,000 applicants, TFA looks for elite college graduates willing to dedicate two years to teach in rural and urban areas across the country.
TFA’s criteria for admission, said Kopp, are more about “personal characteristics,” such as the ability to face challenges, than academic achievements.
As the moderator of the event, Harvard Kennedy School professor David Gergen said that Kopp was one of America’s “national treasures.”
“All of us have heard about Teach For America, and a lot of people I think at the College are interested in joining,” said Alice Xiang ’13, who attended the event.
“Overall I think Teach For America’s message is really inspirational,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Christo Schultz converted his second chance at match point, a tired Harvard squad breathed a sigh of relief.
The freshman’s victory, which gave the Crimson men’s tennis team its fourth point of the day, tilted the outcome just enough in Harvard’s favor, helping the Crimson (6-4) defeat a struggling Radford (2-6) squad by a score of 4-3.
“It had the ragged quality of a midweek match,” head coach Dave Fish ‘72 said. “We had some guys who were frayed at the edges today and it showed.”
“We played well, but the energy wasn’t there,” freshman Andy Nguyen added. “We could have been more energetic, supporting each other.”
The action started off well for Harvard, as Schultz and junior Aba Omodele-Lucien teamed up to win the first doubles match, 8-5.
Moments later, sophomore Alistair Felton and Nguyen put the final touch on an 8-4 victory of their own, securing another doubles point for the Crimson.
The Highlanders saved themselves from a sweep in the final doubles match, defeating freshman Joshua Tchan and junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans, 8-6.
But while the singles players were warming up with their opponents, fire alarms began to sound.
After the players evacuated, a chilly 15-minute wait ensued while the Harvard University police checked the building. Singles play then resumed after the alarms were turned off,
Omodele-Lucien, playing lower on the ladder than usual, was the first to finish, steamrolling his opponent, 6-2, 6-2, at the No. 4 spot.
“Aba got a breather,” Fish said of the lineup change. “He’s lost a few matches. It’s going to take him a little while to get that confidence back again.”
The next to end was the No. 1 match, which was commandeered by Radford junior Ivan Salec. A heavy server who is 5-4 on the season, Salec crushed Chijoff-Evans, 6-2, 6-3.
“At the number one spot, if you don’t have your best day, or bring your best energy, you’ll lose,” assistant coach Andrew Rueb said. “We knew [Salec] was a very good player.”
“Alexei was just not ready for that kind of challenge today,” Fish added. “The guy just jumped on him.”
With the quick matches completed and the Crimson up 2-1, the remaining players on both sides picked up the intensity.
Next to fall was freshman Joshua Tchan at No. 5, who was defeated, 6-3, 6-2.
“Josh was just not fully there today,” Fish said. “He’s played some dynamite tennis.”
Of the three matches remaining, each came down to the third set.
Finally, after long battles, freshmen Nguyen and Schultz clinched the victory for Harvard with wins in each of their matches.
“I was very impressed with Andy stepping in and moving up,” Fish said. “[He was] playing a really good player.”
Nguyen, playing a surprisingly high No. 2, won 6-4, 6-7, 6-3.
The rookie had not played higher than No. 4 this season. Fish explained the change as a way to boost Nguyen’s confidence.
“Our team has been dead even [in skill] from No. 2 to No. 8,” Fish said. “All the guys have been playing really well.”
After losing a tough second-set tiebreaker, Nguyen needed something to boost his spirits.
“In the third set, this one guy started cheering, and I started playing better,” Nguyen said. “Just getting [my] energy pumped up and back on track.”
Schultz, at No. 6, rebounded from a 3-6 loss in the first set, winning 6-3, 6-2, in the next two sets to secure the victory for his team.
“Christo played a great match,” Fish said. “He got a little amped up in the first set—he’s got so much energy—its all pouring out in 10 directions. Very solid performance after that.”
In the last and longest match of the day, No. 3 Felton lost in three sets.
The victory was Harvard’s third in a row at home, a streak it hopes to continue against St. John’s this afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may be the last home game for the Harvard women’s hockey team’s seniors, but a win would give two of them—co-captain Kathryn Farni and Anna McDonald—the chance to finish their collegiate careers back home.
If the No. 4 Crimson beats No. 5 Cornell in tonight’s NCAA quarterfinals at 7 pm, it will head to the Twin Cities for the women’s Frozen Four, 15 minutes away from Farni’s hometown of Minnetonka, and not far off McDonald’s New Brighton.
But in order to do so, Harvard will have to get past a Big Red team it has not yet beaten this season—a squad fresh off an ECAC title run.
Cornell first stumped the Crimson in its second game of the season, when Harvard’s freshmen were still getting familiarized with college hockey, and the squad was still getting accustomed to the graduation of its top scorers.
Since then, the newcomers have excelled—led by ECAC rookie of the year finalist Jillian Dempsey—and the Crimson has used a balanced attack to stump opposing defenses.
“I think throughout the entire season, we’ve been improving,” senior Randi Griffin said.
But when Harvard and Cornell met again in January, the Crimson was still unable to come away with the victory, ending the game in a 4-4 stalemate after overtime.
“We didn’t perform as well as we would’ve liked to against Cornell this year,” co-captain Cori Bassett said. “But it’s playoffs now. None of that really matters.”
Up to this point, the narrative resembles the one surrounding Harvard’s first round of the ECAC playoffs, where it faced Princeton.
Just like in its games against the Big Red, the Crimson had not been able to solve the Tigers in the regular season, losing to them in the fall before tying them in January.
But a strong February gave Harvard the momentum to soundly defeat Princeton in the playoffs, knocking it off in two games by a combined margin of seven goals.
But the speedy Cornell squad will not be as easy to dethrone.
“They’re a fast, skilled team,” Griffin said.  “They have some very talented both forwards and defensemen. They’re a strong skating puck possessing team.”
It will be a different matchup than the one the Crimson faced last weekend against the more physical Clarkson.
“We’re ready for them to come out fast,” Griffin said. “We’re a fast team too so it’s the kind of game we want.”
Harvard used that speed to go on a six-game winning streak starting at the end of January, and showed it off again in its opening round victory against the Tigers in the ECAC playoffs.
Whether or not the Crimson is able to bring that speed early could sway the game. Harvard allowed a goal six minutes into its game against the Golden Knights in an eventual 3-2 loss.
“[We want to] really come out in the first period,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “Making sure we have a lot of energy for those first couple minutes.”
Also key for the Crimson has been its emerging power-play and penalty-kill capabilities. Like its offensive balance, Harvard’s man-down defense and disciplined play throughout games have continued to improve throughout the season.
There are definitely mistakes we’re going to make,” Bassett said. “We’re working on minimizing those but also being able to recover and to be able to capitalize on their mistakes.”
While a recent loss to Clarkson has set the Crimson back, Cornell has been on a 10-game undefeated streak.
It hasn’t lost since January, and the only tie of that streak came on Feb. 5 to Quinnipiac, before the Big Red rolled out to nine consecutive victories including last weekend’s against the Golden Knights.
“I think ultimately, they’re a good team, but it’s all about us,” Bassett said. “They’re going to give us a good game. I think that if we show up to play that we should be successful and that’s what I’m hoping for.”
The NCAA tournament committee seemed to think so, as it gave Harvard the higher seed and the accompanying home-ice advantage. Though Cornell has had the upper hand in head-to-head matches and the ECAC standings, the Crimson has rolled off impressive non-conference victories, twice shutting out the University of Minnesota and winning the Beanpot with shut-outs from a different goaltender, freshman Laura Bellamy.
If Harvard’s been learning all season, the skaters will face their first of what they hope to be three final exams just as the student body emerges from midterm season.
“I think when it gets down to the end and playoffs, you know it comes into the light what you’re playing for and you see the goal,” Bassett said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chemistry is an essential component to a team’s success.
Without it, teams crumble in the most dire of times, succumbing to the pressures of a big game that requires much more than just plain talent.
In order to do well this season, Harvard coach Jenny Allard has ensured that the softball squad continues to foster a tight-knit community of support and encouragement.
She paired sophomore standout Rachel Brown, last year’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year, with rookie Jessica Ferri to provide guidance and advice.
Here are some things Brown shared with The Back Page a few weeks ago about Ferri and the friendship between the two talented pitchers.
Ferri's addition:
“Jess is a great pitcher, and already she’s a great addition to the team. She really makes us a stronger pitching staff, especially because I think we complement each other very well. I’ll throw more up and rise pitches, while she’s more of a drop ball pitcher. She’s a very strong competitor and has a strong work ethic. With her on the team, it adds to the strength of our team.”
Ferri’s work ethic:
“She always wants to practice more. It’s awesome. Right now we’re practicing; well, during the fall, we would practice three to four times a week, and she wanted another one or two days to work out. Like I said earlier, she has a great work ethic, and she’s really hitting her stride, because we are going six days a week, and she’s working hard every practice.”
Ferri's strengths:
“It’s not that she’s just a great pitcher, but she’s also very smart about it. She’s a competitor, so she’s very touch and fierce on the mound, but it’s really funny because she’s the sweetest girl off the field. She’ll go from pitching and being all serious and focused, and once she’s done pitching she’ll be giggling. She’s just really fun.”
Hanging out with Jess outside of practice:
“There’s a big Kappa contingency on the softball team. Jess is actually my little sister in Kappa, and Dana is my big sister, so it’s kind of a pitching dynasty (laughs). So it’s fun. We like hanging out together outside of the sport. It’s kind of funny. During the season we have either Mondays or Wednesdays off, and we miss each other on that day, so it’s fun when we come back together.”

Welcome to your House! Now that your homes have been determined, you have to set about the task of convincing others (and possibly yourself) that your House is in fact the best. What better way to persuade someone of your House's superiority then to spew a list of famous alumni molded by your House? Here are some of the coolest alumni that we could find from each house. Let the historic notables duke it out for you.
 
Adams House alumni include political figures such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, Senator Charles E. Schumer '68, and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger '50. Other famous alumni include Andy Borowitz '80, author William S. Burroughs '36, and architect Buckminster Fuller '17.
Cabot House alumni have made a name for themselves in entertainment. Alumni include country singer Bonnie L. Raitt '72, Weezer lead singer and guitarist Rivers Cuomo '06, and CNN anchor Soledad T. O'Brien '88.
Currier House could potentially take credit for Microsoft—Harvard's favorite drop-out-turned-company-founder Bill H. Gates (formerly '77) and CEO Steven A. Ballmer '77 lived down the hall from each other as sophomores in this Quad House. Additionally, everyone's favorite world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma '76 also once called Currier House home. Other notable alumni include former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff '75 and Caroline B. Kennedy '80.
Dunster House alumni have also made their way into politics. Alumni include former Vice President Al Gore '69, Senator Al Franken '73, and Massachusetts Governor Deval S. Patrick '78. Other famous alumni include actor Tommy Lee Jones '69, Gore's roommate, and author Norman K. Mailer '43.
Eliot House alumni include conductor Leonard Bernstein '39 and former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto '73 (who was originally a resident of Cabot). Eliot was also home to one of Harvard's more infamous alumni: Theodore J. Kaczynski '62, widely known as the Unabomber, called this River House home during his undergraduate years.
Fun fact: Eliot House masters haven't been shy when asked about famous residents. In 1951, Eliot House Master John Finley reportedly bragged to the New York Times, “where else would you find, in one room, the grandson of Matisse, the grandson of Joyce, and the great-great-great-great-grandson of God?”  Finley's chutzpah wasn't unfounded; he was, after all, referring to Eliot A-12 roomates Paul Matisse '54, grandson of Henri Matisse; Stephen Joyce '54, the grandson of James Joyce; and Sadruddin Aga Khan '54, a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
Kirkland House alumni include Facebook co-founder Mark E. Zuckerberg (formerly '06) and actor/screenwriter Wallace M. Shawn '65 (you probably know him from "The Princess Bride" and "Gossip Girl"). We're impressed—keep up the good work, Kirkland House alumni!
Lowell House alumni include novelists John H. Updike '54 and Michael Crichton '64. Lowell House can also count several famous actors as alumni—Natalie Portman '03 and Matt P. Damon (formerly '92) both resided in Lowell House as undergraduates. Several Lowell alumni—such as Nicholas D. Kristof '81 and Chris Wallace '69—have pursued careers in journalism. Other famous names include former Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter '61 and Japanese Crown Princess Masako '85.
Leverett House alumni include legal heavyweights Chief Justice John G. Roberts '76 and University Professor Laurence H. Tribe '76. Other famous alumni include Princeton Professor (and former Harvard Professor) Cornel R. West '74.
Mather House alumni include comedian Conan C. O'Brien '85—enough said.
Pforzheimer House alumni include former New York Times journalist Jennifer 8. Lee and VH1 commentator Mo A. Rocca '91.
Quincy House alumni include former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom J. Ridge '67. Other famous names include former CNN anchor Lou C. Dobbs '67 and the host of NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Peter D. Sagal '87.
 
Winthrop House alumni seem to have found their way into politics. Alumni include President John F. Kennedy '40, Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54, and U.S. Representative Barney Frank '61. Winthrop House has also produced two high-profile economists—both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke '75 and former Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin '60 lived in Winthrop as upperclassmen.
Editor's Note: Mar. 13, 2010
An earlier version of this post stated that former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto was a resident of Cabot House, not Eliot House. In fact, Bhutto lived in Cabot House first, then later moved to Eliot House.

Boloco changed its menu—but why? “We wanted to confuse everyone,” joked Boloco’s General Manager Sal Airo Farulla.
In reality, Boloco changed its menu this week in order to reflect customers’ e-mails, Facebook comments, and tweets. The changes include making the names of some of the burritos and shakes more exciting while adding a few new options (Yucatan Habanero, anyone?).
But no positive change comes without strings attached: Boloco has also increased its price—though only very slightly.  Rather than pay $6.19 for a large burrito, you now need to dole out $6.25. Large smoothies—which formerly cost $4.29—have increased by 21 cents to $4.50. But Airo Farulla says that now, the burritos will be larger and the shakes will have more fruit.
These changes come after Boloco extended its Friday and Saturday night hours to 2 a.m. earlier this year in order to attract the more, well, jovial crowds still out on their weekend adventures. After 11 p.m. on weekend nights, happy Boloco diners can also now purchase items from the breakfast menu.
Airo Farulla also noted that Boloco plans to host another free burrito day on Wednesday, Mar. 24, when he expects to give away between 1800 and 2000 burritos. This give-away day comes after Boloco’s previous “snowloco” free burrito day in early February.
The reaction to the menu changes has been mostly positive, according to Airo Farulla. But he said, “One guy looked at the menu board and said, ‘It’s like doing a math calculation to read the menu!’” Our recommendation: avoid the bean counting and just eat.
