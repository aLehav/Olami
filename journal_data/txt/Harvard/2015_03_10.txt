After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jessica Brandl was having a busy Thursday. She had just finished an hour-long slide show after leading a 6-hour workshop that morning—two responsibilities she has taken on as this year’s artist in residence of the ceramics program at the Office for the Arts. But clad in colorful stripes and funky patterned socks, Brandl looked anything but worn out. At the end of a hectic afternoon, Brandl took time to talk to The Crimson about her artistic beginnings, themes in her work, and her time at Harvard.
The Harvard Crimson: What inspired the focus on Americanism present in much of your work?
Jessica Brandl: I essentially start from what I know, which is this domestic understanding of, “Okay, I live in middle America. What kind of group of middle Americans am I from? Am I upper class? Am I lower class?” I try to find who and what you are also while using where you are. It’s kind of like you’re plotting out a coordinate of when and where you are.
THC: Does the fact that you grew up in the Midwest affect your art in a specific way?
JB: I’m sure that it would be different [if I had grown up somewhere else], but I think that one of the little revealing windows I had was that things are not as they always are where you grow up.… I was born in Texas and had a formative childhood growing up right outside of Austin. So that’s a really metropolitan area that’s got arts culture, all that stuff. [But] my parents didn’t really take us to art museums and that kind of stuff because…it wasn’t associated with their social background of being kind of lower class, kind of working class.
THC: What’s more important to you, that people use your pottery or that they see it?
JB: One thing that is pretty specific to the Midwest is this…“it’s gotta have a function” mentality. That always stuck with me even as I explored drawing, painting, making art with a capital “A”: that its function is itself to be appreciated. [But] I like to revel in the fact that art is also very subjective.… There is a fascinating undeniability when you try to make a cup into art. I can make a drawing, a study, a statement on the exterior. If you hate it, that’s fine—you don’t have to look at it, because it still has a secondary function: that you can pour your coffee into it and drink out of it. Just don’t look at the side that bothers you.
THC: In Rome this summer, you’ll be working with pottery artifacts from Pompeii. What are your thoughts on if someone were to pick up your artwork centuries from now?
JB: It would be an exceptional thing. Any time any artist makes an object, they are setting it in a motion that outside of their studio they don’t necessarily have control over anymore.… It really does have its own life. And it has meaning, especially if it’s an ambiguous representation, that may not be communicated as you initially did but [it’s] still no less beautiful.… With the artifacts that you see, a lot of those objects were not intended to last forever. They got lucky; they got the object antiquity lottery.… I’m working in that same vein of solid permanence.… My objects could hit the lottery. They could be reconstructed, remanipulated.
THC: How has your time at Harvard impacted you?
JB: I wanted to come to Harvard because [I was] looking for ways and systems of talking about my work.… What’s the big picture? What’s the system that drives this all? How can I talk about this inner relationship between reading objects as reflecting their history and culture and my role as an organism in that culture? My high school was so conservative that I don’t think I ever had evolution taught…I began to explore that and I found that a lot of the writers about the subject were from Harvard. I was…operating like this do-it-yourself anthropologist. Coming to Harvard was secretly indulging the fact that a lot of my new heroes [gave] me a better angle on…the way the world works.

“‘Avenue Q’ is ‘Sesame Street’ if ‘Sesame Street’ was about sex, drinking, racism, and growing up,” says the show’s director Jake S. Stepansky ’17. Adapted from the Broadway musical of the same name, this rendition of “Avenue Q,” running March 10th and 11th at the Oberon, reflects the anxiety, vulgarity, and vulnerability that come from entering adulthood. Yet despite the musical’s crass humor and biting satire, Stepansky hopes to highlight the genuine optimism at its core.
The show’s story begins when a young college graduate moves into an apartment on an unnamed city’s Avenue Q with big dreams but only a bit of money to sustain them. He befriends the colorful inhabitants of the neighborhood, learning life lessons and what it means to be an independent, self-sufficient, and occasionally desperate adult.
While the show is certainly a dramatic thematic departure from “Sesame Street,” many of its major characters are represented by puppets of a similar style. The play’s seven actors even received training from professional puppeteer Jon Little, who taught them how to breathe life and emotion into their felt puppets. The resulting characters have the potential to be far deeper and more complex than one might expect from a puppet show. For example, Brooke E. Sweeney ’17 plays Kate Monster, a down-to-earth puppet who yearns to create a school for monsters and find romance. “She questions herself in a lot of things and…realizes that her dreams might not come true,” Sweeney says. “I think everyone relates to that, feeling down, at one point in their lives…but she goes forth, puts her head up, and keeps marching on.” In the world of “Avenue Q,” even puppets have real-world issues.
The musical’s songs are intended to give a irreverent spin to the show’s “Sesame Street”-like style. “Everyone’s a Little Racist,” “The Internet is for Porn,” and “You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want (When You’re Makin’ Love)” are a few of the songs featured. These lyrics might sound brash coming from a puppet, but the cast hopes that the songs will successfully convey the struggles of entering adulthood. In addition, music director Isaac L. Alter ’16 says that the classic Broadway sound of “Avenue Q’s” music is bound to entertain listeners. “It has a range of emotion, going from happy to sad, and…it accentuates the emotions that characters are going through,” he says.
Stepansky believes that those emotions will ring true with audiences. “Avenue Q is a bitingly funny satire of the ‘Sesame Street’ ethos. It deals with issues of love and relationships, racism and hardship, and sexuality,” he says. Despite the weight these themes carry, Stepansky says the characters’ optimism and lighthearted sense of humor will come out on top. “I think that people will leave feeling that their outlook on life is a little bit brighter.”

The Din & Tonics and the Callbacks circled up in traditional a cappella formation on Saturday night in Sanders Theatre to deliver a night of steamy songs and sarcastic puns. The performance, dubbed “Callbacks SnoweDIN: A Jam for Non-Critical Personnel,” marked the final spring concert for the Dins and the Callbacks.
Callbacks underclassmen honored their four graduating seniors with farewell speeches: Trevor J. Byrne ’17 described Kimberly A. Onah ’15, president of the Callbacks, as “Harvard’s Beyoncé” before she took the mic to sing “It Don’t Have To Change,” a John Legend song arranged by fellow Callbacks member Cynthia S. Meng ’15. Other senior solo songs included “Galileo” by the Indigo Girls, performed by Johanna A. Lewis ’15, and a rendition of Adele’s “Turning Tables” by Krystal L. Ortiz ’15. Ortiz and Onah, along with Stephanie M. Johnson ’18, then led the Callbacks in an arrangement of Ella Henderson’s “Ghost.” Such arrangements, in which an individual member carried the bulk of the melody as a soloist, comprised the bulk of the Callbacks’ performance.
In contrast, the Dins emphasized enthusiasm from their singers in the form of group-coordinated pieces, including the appearance of a long-standing Dins’ tradition: Dean Friedman’s “McDonald’s Girl.” One of the group’s most famous numbers, “McDonald’s Girl” includes choreographed dance moves ending in acrobatic golden arches formed from Din members propped on one another’s shoulders. The Dins also showcased their ability to synchronize voice and movement with their encore piece, a jazzy rendition of Taylor Swift’s “Blank Space” featuring soloist Leon Y. Pan ’18—at times up to three members took the microphones at the front of the stage to sing only a few lyrics each. The songs were interspersed with what the Dins called “DinImpressions,” humorous sketches during which members assembled in formations spelling out puns with their bodies: “WiDiner Library,” “The IDINinterod,” “Dinny Putt Putt,” and “DIN Kardashian.”
In a show filled with traditions, one surprise stood out—the “Sanders Sh’Boom Break” in the middle of the alumni song, in which Dins past and present climbed onstage to perform. During the interlude, Din alumnus John F. Morton had his beard half shaved on stage by another alumnus, to the surprise of the current Dins members and the audience. “It’s our own little way of trying to take the pressure off the performers,” Morton said after the show. “It lets them realize that there is something out of their control going on and they can relax a little.”
Amid the congratulations for graduates of the two groups, freshman Dins shared their approach to performing well as new members. “I think the most important thing is the energy that you bring to [the performance]...and [to] funnel that into what you’re singing: the face, the gestures,” James W. Baskerville ’18 says.
Even with the measured attitude they took to their performance, the new Dins confessed to feeling nervousness and excitement prior to the show, comparing the thrill to being on a concert high. “It’s bright lights. It’s really exciting and a little nerve-wracking,” says Aaron B. Argyres ’18, who soloed in “McDonald’s Girl.”
But Baskerville and Argyres were able to overcome their nerves to put on an enthusiastic performance with the other members and alumni of the Dins and of the Callbacks. As the groups’ seniors bid goodbye in their final swan song performance, the atmosphere inside cavernous Sanders Saturday night felt warm enough to melt Cambridge’s mounds of snow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon entering the Institute of Contemporary Art’s exhibition, “When The Stars Begin To Fall: Imagination of The American South,” the visitor is immediately confronted with Xaviera Simmons’s “The Favorable Outcome of Every Navigation.” A huge block of wooden signs, aligned to form a square, displays scribbled white words, such as “ways to seduce and make seed amber” and “resting here and there with a dark lust.” This work of mixed media, striking and visually suggestive, demands further understanding of its cultural and political background. It is this desire for contextual comprehension that led to the creation of ICA Reads.
An integration of arts and literature, ICA Reads is a new program that invites visitors to read a recent literary work that had a large social impact and then come to the ICA to find the relationship between the book and the current exhibition. The book recommended for the program’s inaugural year is “Citizen: An American Lyric” by Claudia Rankine, a prose poem that addresses racism in daily American life. “When the Stars Begin to Fall,” which reflects on black life in America from the perspective of over 35 artists, accompanies the book. “We wanted to come up with a new program to connect contemporary literary voices with contemporary visual arts,” says Monica Garza, director of education at the ICA and leader of the program. “We wanted to give people a different way to connect with the works.”
Currently, ICA Reads consists of three components: a drop-in book tour, scheduled discussions, and a talk given by the author. Offered on Thursdays through Sundays, the tours feature specially trained guides who provide assistance to help visitors find the relationship between the book and the art in the museum. Meanwhile, at the discussions, a guest speaker talks about his or her own perspective of the book and its link to the works. According to Garza, the connections drawn in the discussions and tours are varied; they can be explicit—like the presence of works by David Hammons both on the book’s cover and in the ICA’s exhibit—or implicit. “Writers, visual artists, visual performers are all trying to tell a story or share their perspective,” Garza says. All of this leads up to the end of the season, when author Claudia Rankine will come to the ICA to discuss the work.
The ICA initiated the program to help their artworks inspire visitors be more interested in the artworks on display. “A lot of contemporary artists are dealing with very important issues of our times, whether it’s about environment or identity issues or popular culture, anything of that sort,” Garza says. “And of course...a lot of books that are coming out...are dealing with a lot of the same issues.” According to Garza, it is a natural step for the ICA to juxtapose visual arts and literature to present a bigger picture to the public.
Since ICA Reads began in February, the program has received great enthusiasm from the literary communities in Boston and Cambridge. Due to the positive response, the museum looks forward to the program’s bright future, including a new topic for early next year. “Everyone has been extremely supportive and wonderful about this, and that makes us more enthusiastic to continue this program,” Garza says.

Jennifer Bornstein, an artist who works in diverse media and a 2014-2015 Radcliffe Institute Fellow, is a deliberate speaker. In a similar manner, her newest exhibit deliberately juxtaposes two works that are at first glance incredibly different. “Two Videos,” currently on display since Thursday at the Johnson-Kulukundis Family Gallery of Byerly Hall, is a synergistic piece of art that uses seemingly distinct videos to express Bornstein’s artistry and development.
The exhibit places two clips, made 20 years apart, in juxtaposition, paying attention to the underlying thematic similarities of the seemingly unrelated films. The first video, “Collectors’ Favorites” from 1994, features Bornstein, but the second video, “Untitled” from 2014, does not. Nevertheless, the two pieces reflect a consistency in Bornstein’s pursuits. “It is very interesting to put these two works in a room together,” Bornstein says. “My interests haven’t changed in the past 20 years.” “Two Videos,” therefore, serves as both an examination of the evolution of her art and a display of ongoing themes she has considered throughout her career.
“Collectors’ Favorites” presents a young Bornstein, still in graduate school at UCLA, appearing on a public access television show that introduces collectors and their items of choice. In her episode, Bornstein displays a wide assortment of everyday objects, from an array of Starbucks cups and bags to a board of various coffee beans of different flavors. About 20 minutes long, the video is more of a statement on material culture than it is a simple television episode, according to Bornstein.
“It was at a time when I lived in LA; I was very struck by the culture of disposability that exists [there],” Bornstein says of the video. “Everywhere you go there’s plastic being thrown away: plastic take out containers, plastic bags. It seemed like material culture was being generated at a rapid pace and being disposed of…I was horrified by it, frankly.” In reaction to LA’s materialism, Bornstein decided to display all sorts of seemingly disposable objects in a new light—as valuable collectors’ items.
For Bornstein, there was no better place to pursue the project than on television. “I found myself being surrounded by the production of media…and I decided that the best way to talk about the culture that was surrounding me at the time was by joining it,” Bornstein says. “So I got myself invited on a TV show.” After the episode was filmed, Bornstein retained a copy of the show, saving it for 20 years until she recently decided to exhibit alongside “Untitled,” her newer work.
Upon first glance, “Untitled” is entirely different from “Collectors’ Favorites.” Inspired by an anthropological film called “Trance and Dance in Bali,” “Untitled” shows a group of nude women wrestling, prancing, and dancing on a dirt floor in front of a simple, white backdrop. The video is silent, focusing on the movements and interactions of the figures.
“Untitled” draws upon Bornstein’s long-standing fascination with anthropology. “I’m interested in people and communities of people, and much of the work that I made early on was involved with working with people,” Bornstein says. “I would never travel to a faraway land to do so—I would go down to the community center in my neighborhood or to the shopping mall… I think I was always doing my own kind of anthropology but without ever leaving home.”
So when she encountered “Trance and Dance in Bali,” a 16 mm ethnographic film about Balinese dance rituals made by two anthropologists in the 1930s, Bornstein was fascinated. “It’s an incredibly beautiful film…I think very highly of it, and was very curious about it as a cultural document.” She then began wondering how she could combine anthropological research with art. “I started to think about what it would mean if I used this cultural document as the starting point of an artwork,” she says.
She first mimicked the movements and staging of “Trance and Dance in Bali” in “Untitled.” There are a few striking differences between the two films, however, including the fact that Bornstein’s performers are female and nude. “[Another] reference point [for me in creating “Untitled”] is the history of performance art made by women in the 1970s, which often incorporated nudity,” Bornstein says. “I was curious about how women were using themselves in artworks as subject matter, and it was often a political statement. I started to wonder what it would mean to use nudity in artwork today, and if it would function as a political gesture.”
The two videos, one about materialism and the other about anthropology and feminism, seem dissimilar on the surface. But Bornstein maintains that there are underlying semblances  between “Untitled” and “Collectors’ Favorites.” “[They share] an interest in performance or in contemporary terms, the performative in art, specifically…also in anthropology and material culture,” she says. According to her, both videos lend themselves to a discussion of general culture—one addresses consumerism, and the other examines the image of the female in society.
“Two Videos” is a conglomeration of both dissimilar and complementary pieces. Bornstein’s exhibition allows the viewer to see the evolution of a thoughtful artist—from a young woman prominently featured in her own piece to a woman less visible but just as involved in her work’s creation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was a junior in high school, and I had become pretty comfortable with the phallocentrism of the classical authors. At a boys’ school, you’re pretty ready to believe that anything and everything is a penis, and when your Latin teacher says, “This sparrow isn’t a sparrow,” you’re entirely willing (and indeed enthusiastic) to go along with it. I knew by reputation Petronius’s “Satyricon,” the raunchy satire of Neronian Rome, but I had never read much of it. It had also never even occurred to me to watch a foreign film voluntarily, so when my Latin teacher tossed a DVD of Federico Fellini’s 1969 “Satyricon” into the classroom player, I had no idea what to expect. This perhaps is for the best, since even my most obscene, Catullus-fueled imaginings could not meet the reality of what I was about to watch. Fellini’s “Satyricon” remains one of the most lurid things I have ever seen.
The film opens on the conflict between roommates Encolpio (Martin Potter) and Ascilto (Hiram Keller) over their boy-lover Gitone (Max Born), and, after Ascilto runs off with Gitone, it follows Encolpio’s trials as he wends his way through the corrupt, fetid tableaux afforded by life in Imperial Rome. It’s a world in which there is much sex but little eroticism, a society obsessed with details of spectacle but not too concerned about principles of any particular sort, a civilization of artifice and posturing. The freed slave Trimalcione (Mario Romagnoli) asks his hired poet Eumolpo (Salvo Randone) what he thinks of Trimalcione’s verses. “To tell the truth, you stole them from Lucretius,” the poet replies. “You are no poet.” Trimalcione has him thrown into an oven. Encolpio visits brothels and feasts, the temple and the amphitheatre, and finds all shot through with human pettiness.
“Satyricon” is perhaps the most obviously surreal of Fellini’s films. One scene is introduced by about 40 nude men and women jumping up and down in a swimming pool; in a brothel, Encolpio sees a parade of gross caricatures of perversion, from bondage to fat fetishism; at Trimalcione’s feast, mimes and dancers in fantastical costumes writhe and gyrate without stop. Fellini is more than a shock artist, however, and he knows that, without touchstones of sanity to hold the viewer’s interest in the work, he or she will disengage entirely from the spectacle. His solution is brilliant: through the film, actors in the edges of the frame break one of the cardinal laws of cinema and stare directly into the camera. Their eyes plead with the viewer: “Get me out. Get me out.”
This was a lot for a high schooler who was expecting a movie about penis jokes. I was deeply unsettled. After looking into that hell, it was difficult to take the real world at face value, to avoid wondering whether or not everyone around me was as distorted and foul as what I had just seen—whether or not I was one of those people staring at the camera.
Since that time, “Satyricon” has remained the movie I go to when I need to feel that distance and adopt the outsider’s mode, to take on the pleading eyes of the satirist. This movie is not just a monument of literary adaptation or a textbook of Fellini’s elegant framing and angles; it is the most estranging experience I have ever had. In a society that is concerned with lulling the individual into the soft-blue glow of digital screens, we need estrangement. We need to be shaken, to see overwhelming follies so that we can see them more clearly when writ small. We need “Satyricon.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finding success with volumes of poetry, Paul Beatty found attention as a fiction author in 1996 with his debut novel, "The White Boy Shuffle," which tells the story of a young black man’s upbringing in Santa Monica and his unlikely rise to stardom in Los Angeles. "The Sellout" riffs on similar themes, chronicling key events in the coming-of-age of its unnamed narrator and exploring notions of race, class, and inequality with a sharp edge. Beatty’s is an excoriating satire that manages to address contemporary issues with a fascinating blend of recklessness, sensitivity, tenderness, and humor—an appropriately complex mélange of sentiments and tones, given the novel’s relentlessly complex subject matter.
It is set in the fictional locale of Dickens, Calif.—a so-called "agrarian ghetto" so inundated with ignorance, violence, and poverty that, near the start of the novel, the state decides to disown the town, refusing to acknowledge its existence altogether. Responses to this turn of events vary—some people are left feeling disenfranchised, others relieved that the shameful city has gotten its just desserts. Still others, like the narrator and eponymous "sellout" feel compelled to take action to revitalize the town. He settles on an unconventional action: the reestablishment of racial segregation in Dickens. From this provocative premise, Beatty’s novel launches into an irreverent examination of the present age of race and its discontents.
The vicinity of Dickens is inhabited by such idiosyncratic residents as the narrator’s father, a social theorist who constantly uses his son in psychological experiments aimed at investigating the dynamics of race in America; Hominy Jenkins, an aging, former child star known for his demeaning slapstick roles in the "Little Rascals" shorts; Marpessa, the protagonist’s childhood friend and on-again-off-again romantic interest who becomes a co-conspirator in his schemes; and Foy Cheshire, an imperious intellectual rival to the protagonist’s father and a staunch opponent to the protagonist’s efforts to revive Dickens. Such characters and their various interactions provide Beatty with rich opportunities to satirize the ways in which a variety of different types of personalities react to the travails of modern life.
The vision of the modern world portrayed by "The Sellout" is a bleak one, to be sure, and the narrator’s often cynical perspective on the events around him seems a natural consequence of his experiences there. It is a world in which there exists a rural community whose continued presence is so ignominious that California feels most comfortable literally taking it off the map. It is a world in which the last of the once-beloved Little Rascals of yore is now a widely reviled figure, possessed of a servility and self-loathing so intense as to approach suicidal.
In the case of the narrator’s father, it is also a world where a man respected and renowned for his effectiveness as a crisis negotiator in standoffs between the law enforcement and the denizens of Dickens can himself be fatally shot in a confrontation with police, in an incident that seems as completely avoidable as it is tragic. Details like this are an important part of what gives "The Sellout" its pathos. As absurd as some of the circumstances in "The Sellout" may seem, others are painfully true-to-life, and remind the audience that cruel absurdities—not unlike those depicted in the novel—are elements found in reality as well.
It is a testament to the author’s writing skill that, despite its nearly incessant gloom, the novel remains captivating. Beatty’s prose crackles with wit and relatability throughout the story. The author deftly utilizes evocative similes and clever allusions to illustrate his points, as when he describes the public opinion of Hominy Jenkins as that of "a mark of shame on the African-American legacy, something to be eradicated, stricken from the racial record, like the hambone, Amos ’n’ Andy, Dave Chappelle’s meltdown, and people who say ‘Valentime’s Day.’" Erudite scholars of history and the ardent devotees of popular culture alike may find references to appreciate in the text.
It is worth noting that "The Sellout" is not a book that shies away from incorporating coarse or derogatory language in its dialogue or narration. Characters in this novel sling the word "nigger" around with a frequency and casualty that could cause "Django Unchained’s" hellfire criers to blush. Beatty consistently spells the epithet with the "-er" ending rather than using the variant "nigga"—a phrase that some might deem friendlier and potentially more palatable—in a decision that seems calculated to make the discourse presented by the novel seem more frank and unequivocal. If readers can slough off their potential discomfort with this phenomenon, they are likely to find that this, too, strengthens the narrative.
At the end of the "The Sellout," after countless pastiches, critiques, and indictments of Black America, White America, and America in general, it may be difficult to imagine the book ending on an even remotely hopeful note. But to its credit, it does so gracefully, and transitions in its final pages away from its relentless mode of cynicism and towards a quiet, more ponderous mood. After all the hijinks and antics that filled the previous pages, this is a significant shift, yet it feels like an appropriate denouement to the outrageous events, and affords the reader a chance to meditate on the story without forcing the book to summarize its main drives in a way that feels jarringly didactic out of place. This is the final success of Paul Beatty’s work: It does not attempt to forcibly impress its purpose or identity on readers, but instead allows them a latitude to make of it what they will.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine La Rosa Nautica, an upscale restaurant in Lima, Peru. Tourists sit around seaside tables, looking out at gulls and surfers. Two wealthy old men, Don Ismael Carrera and his friend, Don Rigoberto, sit and order a luxurious meal. Ismael describes the scandal his upcoming marriage will cause in Lima and the annoyance it will occasion for his sons, then abruptly adds that his sons will likely have him “killed by a hired assassin, if they can.” Across Peru, in the provincial city of Piura, small business owner Felícito Yanaqué begins another ordinary day in his sleepy hometown, only to find a letter on his door notifying him that he is going to be extorted very soon. The extortion letter is signed, whimsically, with “a rough drawing of what seemed to be a spider.”
Mario Vargas Llosa’s “The Discreet Hero” (translated by Edith Grossman) depicts a pleasant, prosperous Peru; no violence to speak of actually takes place in this new novel. Yet the shadow of violence extends throughout, popping up almost absurdly in the oddest of situations. Either despite or because of its prosperity, Vargas Llosa’s Peru is terribly corrupt—but he makes it lovable anyway. Like Peru, “The Discreet Hero” hides considerable energies behind an appearance of drifting surf and can be magnetically exhortative as well as almost frustratingly remote.
Vargas Llosa is a Nobel laureate; this is not his first swing at the bat. In this latest endeavor he reuses many elements from previous novels; in particular, his signature interlacing dialogue technique, which merges two conversations together to simulate a flashback, makes a return , as do characters from past novels. That said, “The Discreet Hero” is not merely a rehashing of earlier work. It demurely ventures into the new and continues the old. Judging by the mentions of Justin Bieber’s rise and the Eurozone crisis in the final chapter, it is set around 2010, making it the first Vargas Llosa novel to focus on its own time period since “The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto” came out in 1997. And yes, that’s the same Don Rigoberto from the introduction, a delightful, urbane man who brings an aesthete’s narration to Ismael Carrera’s rather sordid story.
Vargas Llosa frequently mentions the fact that Peru has enjoyed robust economic growth for the last couple of decades, and the novel’s two storylines are, at first glance, about money: The extortionists demand money from Felícito, and Ismael remarries primarily to disinherit his sons. But money is only ever a medium of exchange. What’s actually at stake? Another clue presents itself when a number of characters tie Peru’s prosperity to increasing criminal activity. When Felícito takes his case to the police, the sergeant gives him a bizarre lecture on how organized crime is “the price of progress.” That said, apart from a magical chapter when Vargas Llosa slips into the head of the police sergeant and the style of a crime novel, “The Discreet Hero” is not exactly about crime. Nor is it about corruption among the police, the military, or some other government bureaucracy, all of which are familiar targets for the author. Vargas Llosa seems much more concerned with the state of Peru’s youth, and the corruption that worries him is more spiritual than the mere misappropriation of money. “The Discreet Hero” is filled with fears that children, especially sons, are turning out wrong; a number of characters theorize that those children are being spoiled. In the end, however, the events of the novel disprove that theory: Fault rests with society in general, not just parental overindulgence.
Against this malign society, Vargas Llosa pits his model of the “discreet hero,”  creating memorable, heartwarming individuals who embody a kind of self-deprecation that may not seem heroic at first. Felícito, for instance, is hardly an impressive man at first glance. Everyone comments on how small he is; he is always all buttoned up. Yet Felícito proves utterly incorruptible, determined to obey his father’s charge not to let people “walk all over him.” Vargas Llosa’s emphatic pen makes his people unexpectedly heroic, even though none of their actions are particularly dramatic. Despite the singular declension of the title, Felícito is not the only candidate who qualifies for the designation of “discreet hero.” A number of characters stand up against corruption, both tangible and spiritual. It is safe to say that few good readers can go through this book without coming to admire Felícito, or growing fond of Don Rigoberto.
The dual storylines of the novel follow a nearly identical dramatic structure: They move from playful absurdity towards very real dramatic tension, climax simultaneously, and spend the final portion of the book in a state of shared detachment. The point at which these two storylines converge would be extremely unsatisfying in the hands of a less skillful writer than Vargas Llosa, because the meeting point does almost nothing to advance the plot of either storyline. One might reasonably wonder what exactly the point of such an intertwining structure might be. The nobility and singularity of Vargas Llosa’s characters, however, carries readers through in every part.
On closer scrutiny, much of “The Discreet Hero” feels just as elusive of definite meanings as this plotline convergence point. Situations intrigue and tease, always just out of the reader’s reach. For instance, Don Rigoberto is worried throughout the book about his son, Fonchito. Though friends, family, and even a psychiatrist swear Fonchito is perfectly sane, his son nevertheless continues to see and talk with a man named Edilberto Torres whom no one else can see. Like a human Rorschach blot, Torres absorbs interpretations more revealing of Rigoberto’s own mind than anything else: Fonchito is mad, Fonchito sees the devil, Fonchito is lying to him.
Vargas Llosa never gives an entirely satisfying explanation to the problem of Edilberto Torres. And yet the story is so interesting that he must be forgiven for leaving his readers hanging. That is the way of his Peru: flawed and often inexplicable, but always, always, worth a visit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress after receiving an invitation from Speaker of the House John Boehner without the knowledge or subsequent approval of President Obama. Irrespective of the content of the speech, Boehner should not have invited Netanyahu to speak in front of Congress without the President’s consent. The United States government must speak with a unified voice on foreign policy. In the face of consistent policy disagreements between Netanyahu and Obama, the decision to invite Netanyahu is inexcusable.
National security issues are far too important to be subject to the childish bickering that has become the norm in today’s politics. While members of Congress should always question and challenge foreign policy decisions with which they disagree, the conduct of diplomacy between the United States and other nations—especially allies—should never become a political tool. Republicans are guilty of politicizing Netanyahu’s speech, but this issue transcends party lines. Such attempts to score political points by using foreign heads of state or heads of government are detrimental to the ability of the United States to conduct a unified foreign policy.
Further complicating the decision to invite Netanyahu are the upcoming Israeli elections. The legislative branch has little place inserting itself so brashly into the internal politics of an ally and a fellow democracy. President Obama was right to stick with the White House policy of not meeting with foreign leaders facing election, and Speaker Boehner should have considered the implications of the speech in Israel before issuing his invitation.
More disturbing than its effects in Israel, however, are the domestic political rifts exposed by the speech. 58 congressional Democrats skipped Netanyahu’s remarks to show their opposition to Boehner’s invitation, and Vice President Joe Biden also declined to attend. After the speech, Obama strongly criticized both the invitation and the substance of Netanyahu’s argument against a nuclear deal with Iran. In short, the United States government’s diplomatic position—already subject to appropriate democratic deliberation—appeared far more disunited than it ever should.
This result was eminently avoidable. While Congress should maintain a critical posture in evaluating the foreign policy of any administration, that criticism must never rise to the level of intervening between the executive and representatives of foreign governments. Ultimately, the United States must be able to appear united in the conduct of diplomatic relations; incidents like Netanyahu’s speech only serve to undermine that imperative and harm America’s global standing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most Harvard students, last night was a night like any other involving late night coffee runs, treks to Lamont to study for midterms, and dashes through the cold to make it to a meeting on time. For me, however, Monday night marked the culmination of a narrative in which I have had a profoundly vested interest over the past few months. It was the season finale of ABC’s The Bachelor.
Even as I write the words, I’ve already begun to feel my cheeks flush. Being an avid Bachelor fan hasn’t exactly been a source of pride throughout my college career. I’m often tempted to conceal my interest in the show from all but my closest friends at Harvard—firstly because I’m worried people will be concerned by how deep my investment lies, but primarily because I’m ashamed of what people will think.
In fact, if I’m being honest, I’m afraid of one thought in particular: That my interest in reality television somehow undermines my intelligence. After all, the stereotype of a Harvard student is one who sips merlot and watches Mad Men, not one who curls up in front of the television with a skinny margarita to watch The Bachelor. Lately, however, I have begun to question why the two are seen as mutually exclusive. Since when has the person who enjoys NPR not been allowed to enjoy Keeping Up With The Kardashians as well?
And yet there is still the underlying assumption that watching mindless television in turn makes you mindless. I’m here to tell you that I have a mind. I may be able to recite the names of all the Real Housewives across the country, or recall what outfit Jennifer Aniston was wearing last night, or who got the final rose on The Bachelor season finale, but I can also tell you about proto-feminism in 19th century British novels, or the platforms of 2016 presidential hopefuls.
The problem is that for the past four years I’ve wittingly censored myself from revealing the full range of my interests for fear of not being taken seriously as the very thing I pride myself on being: An intellectual.
But if being an intellectual means negating the “guilty pleasures” that make me happy, or allow me to wind down when I’m stressed, then perhaps I need to rethink what it means to be a part of this community. Watching “trashy” television shows and keeping up with pop culture is very much a part of me, and it’s time I stop apologizing for them as if these lowbrow pursuits somehow make me a lowbrow scholar or a lowbrow human being.
This is not to say that my interest in things like celebrity gossip is necessarily enriching or intellectually stimulating. I fully recognize that academic endeavors are infinitely more fulfilling than the cheap pleasures I glean from, say, reading Page Six of the New York Post. I also recognize that tabloids and reality television, among other conventionally lowbrow interests, have their share of negative psychological effects. As such, I try to enjoy my guilty pleasures alongside a necessary dose of perspective that I am watching something for entertainment purposes and nothing more.
All the same, I’m no longer willing to be embarrassed by what entertains me. At the end of the day, guilty pleasures are just pleasures that have been shamed and stigmatized among the intellectual community, and even among society at large. But if you take away that stigma, if you take away that shame, all you’re left with is pleasure, and doesn’t Cicero tell us that pleasure is the chief good?
Whether or not that’s the case, it will still take me a while before I reveal my Bachelor obsession or my interest in the evolution of Kim Kardashian’s hairstyles among academic circles, and it will most certainly be a while before my resume reads “celeb gossip expert” or “reality television aficionado” at the top. Even though I may be ready to reclaim these interests, the rest of society is not. But perhaps, with time, we’ll learn to see guilty pleasures as something more than banal wastes of time and energy. Perhaps, with time, we’ll learn to rid ourselves of the guilt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I got into Harvard, I was immediately cautioned against wearing Harvard shirts outside of Cambridge. I thought that particular proscription was odd. After all, my friends going to other prestigious schools like Stanford, Princeton, and Yale proudly wore their schools gear without a second thought. Telling people where I was planning to attend school was more stressful than it should have been. Why was I accused of “dropping the H-bomb” in a casual conversation when someone else asked me what school I would attend? Nobody used the phrase S-, P-, or Y-bomb to discuss other similarly prestigious colleges.
Harvard, as the nation's oldest university and the one with the largest endowment, occupies a precarious place in the American imagination. For many, it represents the pinnacle of a young person’s meritocratic achievement—a sort of academic city on a hill. Its low acceptance rate has created a mythology around the campus and the students who live and study here. Thousands of tourists from around the world trudge through rain, snow, and sludge every day to visit and rub John Harvard’s shiny left foot for good luck and take pictures on the steps of Widener Library.
But the mythological Harvard is totally different from the educational community where I live, study, and grow. The way that many people glorify the University is troubling. Harvard is not great because of the prominence of its name. Harvard is great because of the diversity of opinions and experiences of the people I meet and interact with on a daily basis. It’s great because scientists here make discoveries that have the potential to cure diseases like diabetes. It’s not great only because it has one of the lowest acceptance rates in the country.
Don’t get me wrong—I am incredibly appreciative of the opportunities I’ve been given here at Harvard and understand how fortunate I am to be here. Choosing to come here was the best decision I’ve ever made. But often, I struggle to keep Harvard in perspective. It’s naturally ego-inflating when several tourists try to sneak pictures of you reading in a colorful chair in the Yard. In a strange way, they add to the sense of accomplishment that comes with being a student here. The tourists are part of the myth that makes the very name of the University so impressive in many parts of the country—a two syllable buzzword practically guaranteed to amaze and impress.
It’s sometimes too easy to buy into platitudes like the idea that the only two As that matter on a Harvard transcript are in the word Harvard. But when we do those things, we choose the wrong interpretation of why Harvard is a great place. Separating my experience at Harvard from the popular myth about it is crucial. My experience must be valuable despite that myth, not because of it. If not, my time spent here would be superficially successful but internally a failure. A school built solely on its reputation is nothing more than a shell of its potential.
By participating in the trend of refusing to drop the “H-bomb,” we only promote the perceived culture of arrogance we must snuff out. Nothing about Harvard makes it too great to be talked about. A successful education—whether at Harvard or elsewhere—must prepare students to be contributing members to the communities that make up their lives. Harvard is great because it’s more than just an ivory tower with the reputation to match. It’s a dynamic place, because what happens here has the opportunity to change the world for the better. Members of this community must keep both its greatness and the true source of that reputation in perspective. As the inscription above Dexter Gate says, “Enter to grow in wisdom, depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” Embracing that motto just might bring about the change we need.

A unanimous Cambridge City Council vote requesting not to renew the city’s energy contract with the TransCanada Corporation after this year might make Cambridge one of just a handful of cities across the United States to pursue total independence from non-renewable energy sources.
The Council’s policy order, approved Feb. 23, cited TransCanada’s proposal to build the KeyStone XL Pipeline as a primary motivation for severing the city’s relationship with the company.  The resolution, sponsored by City Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, specifically points to the environmental impacts of the extraction of tar sands oil as a reason for the move.
TransCanada currently provides electricity for many of Cambridge’s municipal buildings and is under contract with the city until the end of 2015.
Robert L. Paarlberg, an associate at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, said he believes Cambridge’s decision to cut ties with TransCanada is a feasible one.
“Washing their hands of TransCanada, which was an important symbolic move, is something that [Cambridge] can certainly do,” he said.
The policy order also requests City Manager Richard C. Rossi to explore the possibility of “obtain[ing] up to 100% renewable power for all municipal electricity needs.”
City Councilor Nadeem A. Mazen said the legislation would not be an undue financial burden on the city in the short-term while also helping it become more sustainable and economically efficient in the long-term.
“We’ve learned as a city about the importance of switching to green energy,” he said. “Not only could we save money in the long term, and spend not too much more than we currently do in the short term, but it’s the obvious right thing to do.”
Paarlberg, for his part, expressed doubt that Cambridge would be able to follow through on its goal of 100 percent sustainability, saying that he thinks that “it’s highly unlikely the city of Cambridge is going to be able to wash its hands of all fossil fuels and go to 100 percent renewables or even anywhere close to 100 percent renewables.”
Mazen disagreed, citing a major Council effort to follow through on its legislation, though he admitted that the city’s timeline is uncertain.
“Enough people are behind this and looking into it in earnest, so the chances of success are quite high… How long it will take is something that we will be researching over the next few months,” he said.
Science and technology professor Sheila S. Jasanoff ’64 said she hopes that Cambridge’s commitment to sustainability could have a ripple effect across other cities in the United States and beyond.
“Innovations in cities can have quite a level of impact, especially technical sharing, like best-practice transfers,” she said. “The impact of a city should not be underestimated.”
According to nonprofit Go 100%’s website, if Cambridge is able to accomplish its goal of moving to 100 percent renewable energy, it will join about twelve American cities that have become or are in the process of becoming 100 percent renewable in terms of energy usage.
Palo Alto, home to Stanford University, is also on Go 100%’s list of renewable cities. Palo Alto began using 100 percent net renewable energy in 2013, meaning any non-renewable energy the city utilized was “offset” with purchase of renewable energy credits.

Undergraduate Council Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 delivered a speech titled "State of the College" to peers in Lowell dining hall Monday, reflecting on his time in the Council and stressing the overall goals of his initiatives so far this semester. Goyal’s speech was part of an annual speech series in Lowell House, where he resides.
Goyal expressed his desire to achieve a balance between fulfilling broad imperatives like inclusion and empowerment and also delivering tangible items to the student body.
“I thought that I had to do something to give back to the institution that has played such an instrumental role in the formative years of my life,” Goyal said. “It is my love and passion for Harvard that has led me to spend hours to perfect this institution.”
Goyal attributed his international background as a major influence on his involvement in the Council and initiatives piloted by UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and himself.
He added that his passion for “giving back” has served as inspiration for initiatives such as Ventfull, the UC-sponsored calendar application, and Side by Side, a gender equity campaign spearheaded by Mather House representative and inactive Crimson news editor Michelle S. Lee ’16.

Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 proposed a funding initiative to sponsor students pursuing public service opportunities to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in a meeting Friday.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said in an interview that they are concerned that students of lower-income backgrounds are discouraged from seeking summer internships in the public sector, which are often unpaid, and instead gear their interests toward private sector opportunities with potentially more lucrative compensation.
Nasrollahzadeh said that students can face additional expenses, including apartment rental fees, relocation necessities, and travel, that worsen the burden for students with more limited means.
“Whether that comes from the College, whether that comes from OCS money, or whether that comes from a totally private donor, that still needs to be discussed, but it’s a definite priority,” Nasrollahzadeh said.
According to Goyal, Khurana was supportive of the initiative, which the pair designed to emulate Duke University’s “DukeEngage.” Duke’s program, launched in 2007 with two $15 million gifts from the university’s endowment and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, annually provides financial support to about 435 undergraduates participating in immersive community service opportunities.
At Harvard, aside from OCS, the Institute of Politics also allocates grant money to undergraduates in low-paying or unpaid public service internships through its Summer Stipend Program, which specifically takes into account students’ financial needs. In addition, the IOP organizes the Director’s Internship program, which supports selected students with a $4,000 stipend.
Last November, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal ran on a ticket that advocated for more engagement with alumni, and since the start of their term, they have created an alumni advisory network to connect with alumni that served on the UC, a network that they want to leverage for the funding endeavor.
“We’re essentially trying to tie the alumni funding aspect to public service initiatives,” Goyal said. Goyal proposed that alumni donations go toward the summer internship fund.
In addition, the duo plans to hold a town hall forum open to all undergraduates with Khurana and University President Drew G. Faust later this semester. Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal believe that the town hall forum will make the administrators more accessible to students and enable them to ask about larger issues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part I in a three-part series on the College’s residential House system. Part II ran on March 11 and Part III ran on March 12.
When Mattea Mrkusic ’16 transferred to Harvard last fall from the University of Melbourne, she instantly noticed the similarities in their residential systems—and their differences.
Like the Australian institution, Harvard College also has a system of residential buildings meant to serve as hubs of campus life. But unlike the University of Melbourne, Mrkusic said House life here plays a smaller role in students’ lives.
“People put so much energy into their extracurricular and social life here that House life is a second priority for them,” said Mrkusic, who now lives in the Dudley Co-op.
Although Mrkusic has only lived at the College for less than a year, she picks out a larger, years-long trend.
In an email to undergraduates last fall, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana detailed the growing prominence of extracurriculars on campus. Referencing senior survey data from 2010, 2011, and 2013, Khurana wrote that more undergraduates appeared to be spending more time on extracurricular activities.
Administrators have, in recent years, expressed concerns that some undergraduates have prioritized their extracurricular activities at the expense of academics. But the effects of extracurriculars extend well beyond the classroom.
Even as Harvard pumps hundreds of millions of dollars into renewing the College’s residential House system with a goal of strengthening the Houses both physically and socially, many students find it difficult to balance their extracurricular commitments while also participating in House-related programming, or they choose not to.
“Over the last many years, the House leadership has felt as though they’re looking around and saying, ‘Where are the students? They’re not here,’” Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said.
Although not a strict dichotomy, extracurriculars and House life often compete for undergraduates’ limited time. This means that some students, left rushing between class and student group meetings, spend little time in the Houses—even though administrators hail them as the cornerstone of the undergraduate experience. Others simply prefer to spend time with friends they know through their activities than those they met through their House.
“Administrators may need a reality check on the state of House life right now and what needs to happen so that it can become stronger,” former Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said.
STARTING ONE YEAR BEHIND
Through rhetoric and action, the leadership of the College unambiguously argues that its residential House system has come to define, or at least seem to embody, the undergraduate experience. On video, in writing, and in public remarks, the College makes that much clear.
“This is the Harvard experience, and this is a critical part of it,” said Khurana, who has been master of Cabot House since 2010.
Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich acknowledges that the House system is not the most efficient way to run the College—each House has its own dining hall and operates semi-autonomously—but argues that the model is purposeful.
“We’ve organized the undergraduate experience here around Yard and House life. That’s really a cornerstone of what the Harvard undergraduate experience is,” Friedrich said.
But for a number of undergraduates, extracurriculars complicate the transition into the Houses, which starts in March of freshman year. By the time upperclassmen descend on the Yard in a frenzy on Housing Day to welcome freshmen to their future homes along the River or in the Quad, many freshmen have already joined at least one student group and, more or less, found a stable group of friends.
“Oftentimes, that’s the case—that students are so drawn into their extracurriculars in their first year that by the time they've gotten to the Houses, they’ve oftentimes made friends that are reflected in their blocking groups, and then they have their activities that connect them to everything but the House,” Lassonde said, referencing what he said is a common perception among House staff. “By the time they move into the House, the game is up.”
Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard and a former Winthrop House tutor, said freshman year is often a time of flux for students who are trying to figure out how extracurricular activities will define their time in college.
Although Ranen emphasized that extracurriculars are a “huge part” of the undergraduate learning experience, he said Houses find it difficult to break up pre-established friends in blocking groups and extracurricular organizations.
MOVING IN
When students move into their upperclassman Houses at the start of sophomore year, their extracurricular commitments stay with them, keeping some students too busy to participate in House life and still others uninterested.
When Kevin Liang ’16 was first assigned to Adams House, he was excited to become involved in House life. But it became difficult for the former UC representative and former c0-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association to balance the time commitments of extracurriculars and still actively participate in House events. Although Liang praised efforts by House administrators and students to organize programming, the mere time commitment of extracurriculars can be daunting, he said.
“When you are involved in things outside the House, especially if you join them freshman year, you kind of get sucked into them and dedicate most of your time outside of class to those extracurriculars,” Liang said.
Jacob R. Carrel ’16, president of the Harvard College Democrats, said he is often late to Winthrop stein club events on Thursday nights this year because of board meetings. While Carrel said he actively participates in many Winthrop events, other events also compete for his time, meaning that he may have to choose extracurricular commitments that conflict.
“We’re competing for students’ times, and students have ready-made communities outside the Houses,” said Thomas S. Wooten ’08, a tutor in Quincy House who has researched the role of extracurriculars at the College.
Mather House Master Michael D. Rosengarten similarly said he thinks that as both academics and clubs become more demanding of time, it can detract from House life.
“Extracurriculars often have a purchase on students in a way that going to hear a speaker, even in your House, can't if it conflicts,” Lassonde said.
Further, while some administrators say the Quad fosters a unique sense of community among its residents, and Friedrich adds that the College has invested resources in improving shuttle service to mitigate distance problems, some students say living in the Quad can make striking a balance between House life and extracurriculars harder.
Shuffling between the Quad and River Houses during the week for various students groups meetings, Goffard said he ate about twice as many meals in Kirkland as he did in Currier last semester, leading him to feel less connected with House life.
“There can be oftentimes this fundamental conflict between extracurriculars and House life, and I think that’s pronounced in the Quad,” Goffard said. “For people who live in the Quad, that sacrifice is much more real.”
Santiago Pardo ’16, co-chair of Adams House Committee, said his House’s location in Harvard Square makes it easier for residents to balance the two.
Administrators and House masters, for their part, say they recognize the stress that academics and extracurriculars place on House life. Lassonde said the Houses should work to attract their students to events.
“The burden is on the Houses to do that, ” Lassonde said. “We should be thinking more about the structure that makes it possible for students to become more connected with their Houses earlier on.”
MISSING OUT?
Administrators, who argue that the House system exposes undergraduates to diversity in a way that other facets of student life do not, have reacted to some students’ choices to spend more time outside the residential system with concern. Some administrators worry that students who ramp up their involvement in groups outside the Houses may be missing out on a unique opportunity to befriend a cross-section of Harvard’s diverse student body.
While some student groups choose members through comp or application processes, students are randomly sorted into their Houses.
“A House is the most naturally diverse place on campus,” Khurana said, arguing that if students spend the majority of their time with people similar to high school peers, they are not taking “full advantage of what Harvard College experience…is set up to offer you.”
Harvard has specifically structured the College’s Houses to offer students a special social experience, according to Friedrich. The several hundred upperclassmen ideally interact in dining halls and through an array of traditional events each House hosts, from low-key discussions and weekly study breaks to extravagant dinners and formals.
Still, Tara Raghuveer ’14, a former UC president who lived off campus her senior year, challenged the assumption that all students should necessarily find friends through their Houses.
“It can be patronizing for undergraduates to hear over and over again that they should build community in this way or they should find their friends through ‘X’ thing instead of ‘Y’ thing,” Raghuveer said.
Indeed, many student leaders say they are already finding fulfilling and diverse circles of friends through their extracurriculars. Colin J. F. Diersing ’16, the president of the Institute of Politics, said he has met people from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives through his involvement with the IOP. He added that this may be a result of the IOP’s size and focus on politics.
While Diersing said he thinks that his House, Cabot, is a “wonderful community” and a “good place to come home to,” he spends a lot of his time at the IOP and enjoys it.
Liang said finding friends through his extracurriculars has been easier than through his House because group members share interests and spend significant time together.
CREATING AN INTERSECTION
Facing some students’ decisions to spend more time time outside their Houses than administrators might hope, some House affiliates are considering how to make House life and extracurriculars intersect.
Many Houses have theater and arts programming, according to Friedrich, while Goffard said some student groups are hosting more events in the Houses in an attempt to bridge the gap between extracurriculars and the House system. Students groups can book House common spaces such as common rooms and  kitchens and utilize dining halls for meeting space.
Groups’ use of House amenities demonstrate the potential for extracurriculars to work in concert with the Houses and strengthen House life, Friedrich said.
Still, the reality remains that House events often struggle to draw many student attendees. In his experience as a tutor, Wooten said House staff often consider events successful if they attract a number of students that totals above the single digits. They attribute small crowds to students’ busy schedules, he said.
Still, students emphasize that participation in extracurricular activities and House life are not mutually exclusive. House Committees, for example, blend both House life and extracurricular life. According to Wooten, many HoCo members interviewed for his research said they considered HoCo their most important extracurricular commitment.
Andrew D. Clark ’16, a member of Currier HoCo, said House involvement and extracurriculars are “definitely competing for time,” but it is important to have both.
“It’s not a zero-sum game,” said Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16, Kirkland’s HoCo co-chair and treasurer of the UC.
But the reality of extracurriculars’ prominence in students’ lives remains.
“I don’t know if House life is ever going to be as big as people’s extracurriculars, unless it is their extracurricular...but that’s not necessarily a bad thing,” Carrel said. “I think we still have a pretty strong House life.”
In contrast to administrators’ vision of House life as the “cornerstone” of a Harvard College education, Goffard said extracurriculars—not House life—have defined his experience at Harvard.
“The majority of the time I spent was not in Currier House,” Goffard said. “What I will remember in 10 or 20 years will probably be the UC and other experiences like that—extracurriculars more so than House life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life opened registration last week for QuNNECT, a peer-to-peer program that aims to foster friendships among BGLTQ-identified students who might not be otherwise involved in Harvard’s queer student groups.
The initiative was organized over the course of a year by Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, who said he found the peer-mentorship structure of queer organizations on other campuses inspiring.
“It’s a different way for people who may not be able to make specific events or do regular things to connect in a low-key way with other people on their own time,” Blecher-Cohen said.
Blecher-Cohen, who is an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said there are few opportunities for queer students to connect if they do not have time to commit to a BGLTQ student organization or attend related events. Blecher-Cohen described QuNNECT as a program to bridge the gap.
Registration for the program has been open for a week, with Monday night marking the final day to sign up. Blecher-Cohen said that as of Monday evening, more than 50 students had registered.
Neimy K. Escobar ’15, who registered for QuNNECT, wrote in an email that she wants to meet new people through the program who may feel marginalized by or not included in queer life. She also wrote that she hopes QuNNECT will reframe queer student life on campus as focused on the wide variety of queer students, rather than being limited to queer student organizations.
After registration closes, Blecher-Cohen will make one-on-one matches based on common interests and motivation for participation in QuNNECT. The expectation is that the peers will meet in a casual setting at least three times throughout the semester to get to know each other and make new connections.
Sasanka N. Jinadasa ’15, who registered for QuNNECT and is also an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, expressed her excitement for the program.
“We need more peer-to-peer mentorship on campus. Particularly in this community, just because our interests are so dispersed and we don’t all hang out in the same circles and spaces,” Jinadasa said. “It’s hard to be able to connect with people who don’t come to the [Office of BGLTQ Student Life] so much, or who don’t hang out in certain queer organizations.”
Blecher-Cohen and Jinadasa said the definition of queer in the context of QuNNECT includes the entire BGLTQ community. Blecher-Cohen further said he hopes QuNNECT will build community across different identities as well.
“If you are gay, you may end up meeting someone who is not gay, but identifies within the queer spectrum. So that’s a way to get exposed to all kinds of different people,” he said.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life offers programming for queer students on campus. Blecher-Cohen said he hopes QuNNECT will become an established feature of BGLTQ student life so that more students can have access to support from the queer community at Harvard in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 11, 2015, at 12:13 a.m.
Harvard University Dining Services has recently entered into a partnership to give up to 2,500 pounds of excess food from dining halls to local community organizations each week.
HUDS initiated the program with Food For Free, an organization started in 1981 dedicated to collecting food that would otherwise be left to waste and distributing it to shelters and pantries. The executive director of Food For Free, Sasha Purpura, set up a meeting with HUDS officials, and they found a way to safely give the extra food the University did not use.
“There are tremendous opportunities when we start working with Harvard,” Purpura said. “We realized just how healthy, nutritious meals are getting discarded everyday from all the universities and institutions just in our immediate area. Food For Free thinks it is an incredible opportunity for these institutions to do what Harvard is doing.”
Meredith L. Weenick, Harvard’s vice president of campus services, said the University was eager to participate.
“Every day, too many families and individuals are forced to make very difficult choices—choices between eating or paying rent or utility bills,” Weenick said in a press release. “Our partnership with Food For Free assures that any food we offer our students beyond what is utilized also serves our neighbors, so this really is a win-win for everyone involved.”
Harvard and Food For Free launched a pilot of the program in Annenberg last summer. Now, the program has expanded to all dining halls. Food that falls under certain guidelines is frozen and bagged then given to Food For Free. No leftovers from students’ plates are donated.
The donated food goes to many organizations including the Cambridge Community Center and the Albany Street Center.
Through Harvard’s donation, the Cambridge Community Center has provided food to adults for events like community nights and to youth for after school programs, according to Darrin Korte, director of programs at Cambridge Community Center. In addition, Harvard has provided the center with two freezers in order to preserve the food from the deliveries.
Because of the food donations from Harvard, the Cambridge Community Center hopes to start up a new program this spring called “Coast Kitchen” in order to turn the food into meals for families to eat.
“We want to be able to get more families to be able to come and use our programs and resources,” Korte said. “One of the best ways to attract them is through food.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 10, 2015, at 9:53 p.m.
Kirsi Anselmi-Stith ’18 hails from Rock Springs, Wyoming. But when she walks into her introductory Arabic class every day, she finds herself next to students with more experience speaking the language, which she says can create an unbalanced learning environment.
“I have definitely come into contact with people who should be on my same level of Arabic but are so much faster that it makes it harder for me to learn,” she said. “A lot of the students had read the Islamic texts already, so they could recall words that I didn’t know.”
Anselmi-Stith’s experience in Arabic is not unique. While several languages at Harvard offer separate tracks for students with prior experience in the language, others—such as Arabic and Hindi-Urdu—do not divide their pupils into different tracks, leaving some students struggling to catch up to more experienced peers sitting next to them.
Chinese—one of the languages with a separate track for heritage speakers—offers sections that proceed not only at a faster pace than the regular classes but also include a specifically designed curriculum to cater to those with prior experience, according to Jennifer Li-Chia Liu, director of the Chinese language program. Heritage learners have been exposed to a language growing up.
“For example, for one of the assignments for the beginning heritage class, the instructor asks students to listen to a recording, because they are really good at listening,” Liu said. “But once they listen to the story, they have to type or write it. You won’t be able to do this type of activity with regular students, because it would take much longer to bring them up to the level of fluency.”
Along with Chinese, Korean offers separate classes for heritage speakers, according to Liu, because these East Asian languages are considered the most difficult for English speakers to learn. These departments are discussing expanding heritage offerings still further, Liu said.
Yet Arabic—also a difficult language for English speakers—intentionally has no such option.
Given the disparity between the written and spoken languages, the Modern Standard Arabic taught in Harvard classrooms does not privilege native Arab speakers because of its differences with the spoken dialect, said William E. Granara, an Arabic professor of the practice.
“If you speak with your grandmother at home and use Arabic around the dinner table, that does not get you to write a sentence,” he said.
David Max Korzen, a graduate student enrolled in an a second-year Arabic course who studied Arabic as an undergraduate and spoke it while enlisted in the military overseas, agreed with Granara that the grammatical differences between local dialects and Modern Standard Arabic are significant. However, he acknowledged that his experiences conversing in Arabic in the Middle East may have made him more confident in his speaking skills than his peers.
“The other students in the class, they know a lot of the basic grammar far better than I do, but they just don’t like to speak,” he said. “They’re so focused on the grammar that they get sort of wrapped around the axle, and they are not comfortable making mistakes.”
Like Anselmi-Stith, Korzen recalled frustration with the rapid progress of experienced students in his undergraduate classes at George Washington University.
Some native speakers in his classes, he said, "had a lot of exposure to this language, and yet they were in introductory classes with me, so they had a leg up.”
While the College adminsters language placement exams, Granara said there have been cases when heritage speakers “slip through the cracks” and intentionally place into a lower-level course. However, he said, initial differences between experienced speakers and first-time Arabic students tend to level out in time.
“At the end of the day, some our best students are kids from Iowa, absolute beginners who do not have the vocabulary or some kind of the cultural underpinnings of the language,” he said. “Ultimately someone’s going to learn the language by discipline and motivation and study. Heritage learners take the class and think it’s going to be an easy A, and it isn’t.”
Some professors, however, say offering separate heritage classes can be uniquely beneficial to students with experience in the language.
Senior Preceptor in Romance Languages and Literature Maria Luisa Parra-Velasco said she developed the College’s only two heritage track Spanish courses to fill a perceived niche of students who grew up immersed in Latino language and culture but are not confident in their abilities to communicate in academic Spanish.
“Usually in heritage classes, we start with what the students know as the base, and we work very hard to validate that knowledge,” she said. “They come to our classrooms feeling they don’t speak well, so we work with those beliefs from a sociolinguistic point of view.”
While Parra-Velasco said her department has no current plans to expand Spanish heritage offerings, she sees increased heritage tracking as “following a national trend.”
“I think that the heritage languages are being recognized more and more as a national resource, and there are a lot of faculty that is committed to making sure the students value that heritage and make it part of their lives,” she said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: March 10, 2015
An earlier version of this article stated that students in Arabic courses learn alongside heritage speakers. To clarify, these courses include students with prior experience in the Arabic language more broadly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a combined 2,400 minutes on the hardwood this season, the Harvard and Yale men’s basketball teams will take the floor of the Palestra in Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon with just 40 minutes standing between each program and the NCAA Tournament.
Per a press release from the Ivy League, the matchup will take place at 4 p.m. and will be broadcast by both ESPN3 and the American Sports Network.
After the Crimson (21-7, 11-3 Ivy) fell to the Bulldogs (22-9, 11-3) in front of a capacity Lavietes Pavilion crowd on Friday night, Harvard’s chances of dancing at a fourth consecutive March Madness were slim: a Dartmouth team entering its final game under .500 would need to beat Ancient Eight top dog Yale on Saturday in order for the Crimson’s tournament chase to remain alive.
For much of the contest in Hanover, that improbability remained. According to collegiate hoops pundit Ken Pomeroy, Yale had a 99.1 percent chance of taking down Dartmouth and thereby punching its ticket to the Big Dance late in the contest, when it was up five with less than 30 seconds to play. But March Madness has earned its moniker for a reason—and just a few minutes later, Dartmouth and Harvard were each celebrating the Big Green’s comeback victory in their respective gyms, states apart.
“Some of [our players] didn’t want to watch it,” said Crimson coach Tommy Amaker late on Saturday night. “They [had to] stand in the other room.”
Notably, this week’s Harvard-Yale rematch will mark the first Ivy League playoff game in which Princeton is not a participant—perhaps one of the strongest indicators that the royalty of the Ancient Eight has shifted in the past few seasons alone.
This year, the Bulldogs and the Crimson split their season series, with each team winning on its opponent’s home floor: while Harvard came up with a gritty, defensive 52-50 win in New Haven on Feb. 7, the Elis earned a 62-52 victory at Lavietes on Friday, taking advantage of an usually poor offensive night for the Crimson, which shot just 32.7 percent from the field and 11.8 percent from beyond the arc.
The last time the conference held a playoff game, each squad’s current seniors were still in high school. With just one game, just 40 minutes, to determine who gets to dance with the best teams in the nation in the coming weeks, all eyes will be on these two rivals programs to see which team handles what Amaker has deemed the “emotional rollercoaster” of Ivy League crunch time more fluently.
“[O]ur league is really hard and our league is really good, and I think these kinds of moments are a true testament to the strength and depth of our conference,” Amaker said. “[Yale is] a really good basketball team, and [the Dartmouth loss was] a tough night for them, but come Saturday when we have to play…they’ll be ready.”
Tickets go on sale Tuesday at 10 a.m. The Harvard athletic department has also announced that it will provide a fan bus for students who reserve their spots by Thursday free of charge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 10/13 Harvard men’s lacrosse team issued a statement with a powerful performance at No. 20 Holy Cross, jumping out to an early lead against the Crusaders and withstanding the hosts’ attempts to keep the score close en route to a 20-9 finish.
On Monday evening in Worcester, a strong second quarter performance by Holy Cross (3-3, 2-1 Patriot), held the Crimson to a one-goal lead, but Harvard (4-1, 0-0 Ivy) poured it on out of the break with with three goals in the first thirty seconds of the second half and a dominating, 8-2 performance in the final quarter.
“We came out of the gates really strong,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We struggled a little bit in the second quarter as the game slowed down and Holy Cross got momentum, but we talked about it at halftime, and we challenged our guys to really dominate groundballs and transition in the second half.”
The Crimson has traditionally controlled its matchups with Holy Cross, coming into the game with a 31-0 record in the series, but this year’s Crusader team has been playing at a higher level than in years past. Holy Cross has beaten two top-10 opponents this season.
Harvard looked like it would pull away early, taking a 4-0 lead through the first 13 minutes of the game, propelled by goals from freshman midfielder Joe Lang and junior attackmen Will Walker, Deke Burns, and Devin Dwyer.
Dwyer, who appeared this season on the Tewaaraton Award watch list, assisted both Lang and Walker on this stretch, and would finish with a staggering eight assists in the game. He also scored four goals, and leads the Crimson in points. His assist and point totals for the game are the highest and second-highest totals across the NCAA this season, respectively, and tie for the highest single-game marks in Harvard history.
“Today’s game was a display of how talented a player [Dwyer] can be,” Wojcik said. “He really stepped up and was nearly flawless in his execution as the quarterback of our offense. It was as good of a performance as I’ve ever seen in my time at Harvard.”
The Crusaders came back with two goals late in the first quarter, but the Crimson bounced back quickly with goals from Burns and junior defenseman Walker Kirby. Holy Cross then added three more goals before halftime, bringing the score to 6-5 going into the break.
From there, it was all Harvard.
The onslaught started with another tally from Burns, assisted again by Dwyer, only 10 seconds into the half. Then Dwyer scored two in a row for the Crimson, both within the next twenty seconds, giving Harvard a four-goal lead.
“The start of the second half was huge for us,” Wojcik said. “We came out and it was like ‘Bang, bang, bang,’ and that really allowed us to take the game over. From that point on, we were able to really play with a lot of confidence and it showed.”
The Crusaders would score twice in the third quarter, but these goals were dwarfed by four more goals from the Crimson, three of which were assisted by Dwyer.
Harvard began the fourth quarter by scoring seven goals in a row, pulling ahead to a 19-7 goal lead to solidify the victory.
Throughout the game, the Crimson struggled from the faceoff X, only securing 11 draws to Holy Cross’s 20, but still managed to win the groundball game by a 32-27 margin and limited its own turnovers, giving up only six to Holy Cross’s 21. Junior attackman Brendan Newman led the Harvard defense with three forced turnovers during the game.
Junior goaltender Bryan Moore, in his second start of his career, finished his day with eight saves.
“We still have places to improve,” Moore said. “But the experiences that our young guys have had now, and some of the improvements that we’ve been able to make recently, are really going to put us in a good place going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell helped the Harvard men’s ice hockey team advance past Brown into the ECAC Hockey quarterfinals with two goals on Friday and the game-winner on Saturday. Several other Crimson athletes also had particularly impressive performances this week:
Sarah Edney, Women’s Ice Hockey
Senior defenseman Sarah Edney took Most Outstanding Player honors in Potsdam, N.Y., this weekend as the Harvard women's ice hockey team captured its first ECAC title since 2008.
On Saturday, Edney provided the tying goal midway through the third period to force overtime in a 2-1 Crimson win over Quinnipiac in the semifinal. The Ontario native continued to shine in the final against Cornell the next day, as she kick-started the Crimson’s eventual 7-3 win by scoring the team's first and third goals. Her unassisted strike at 3:59 in the third period gave Harvard its first lead of the game less than a minute after she provided the primary assist on freshman Karly Heffernan's tying goal.
Jimmy Vesey, Men’s Ice Hockey 
Junior forward Jimmy Vesey is no stranger to outstanding performances – he recently received Ivy League Player of the Year honors. This weekend, Vesey did not disappoint in the ECAC Tournament action against Brown.
On Friday, Vesey scored two goals, which brought his tally up to 24 goals this year. He also assisted on the game's first goal on his way to his his sixth three-point game this season.
Vesey upped both of these season stats on Saturday with a goal and two assists. Vesey is the first Harvard player to reach the 50-point plateau since Dominic Moore ’03 (51 points) did so during the 2002-2003 season.
David Ng, Wrestling
This weekend at the EIWA Championships, senior wrestler David Ng was a standout competitor in a challenging tournament for the Crimson. Despite injuries to his teammates, Ng finished fifth after going 4-2 in the tournament. The senior advanced to the fifth place match after narrowly missing a spot in the third place match in a tiebreaker.
Not only did this fifth place victory secure Ng the fifth and final bid for the heavyweight NCAA championship, but it was also Ng's highest career finish at the EIWA Championships. Having come in eighth in his sophomore year and seventh in his junior year, Ng advanced in the rankings by defeating Garrett Ryan of Columbia, 2-0, to clinch the win.
This wasn’t Ng’s first meeting with Ryan – Ng had lost to Ryan only the day before in the quarterfinal of the championship bracket, 3-1. However, Ng bounced back from this loss by defeating Ryan after an extremely close match. Ng will continue to represent Harvard at the NCAA championships on March 19 in St. Louis.
Miye D’Oench, Women’s Ice Hockey
Junior forward Miye D’Oench scored a controversial goal against Quinnipiac 2:39 into the overtime period Saturday to clinch a spot in the ECAC final.
D’Oench directed the puck into the back of the Quinnipiac net after the puck bounced off her chest near the crease. After a lengthy review, the goal stood.
D’Oench would continue to score in the championship with a power play assist and an empty net goal.

Over the past two weeks or so, students have been inundated with a stream of cryptic messages about summer, sunshine, the beach, warmth, and other things we forgot existed after the third foot of snow accumulated at our doorsteps. We saw photos of people lounging in deck chairs outside the Science Center, with the hashtag #harvardoasis. We were invited to the Facebook event: #harvardoasis. We received emails about it: #harvardoasis. We knew this was a big deal—but that was about it. Thanks to our sources, we at Flyby divulged some juicy tidbits beforehand, but nothing could have prepared us for the actual event that was Harvard Oasis.
Decorations
Wait. Is this even the Science Center? Its usual nondescript walls and hallways were transformed into a summer haven, resplendent with depictions of sharks, fish, and surfboards. Lifeguard chairs and round life preservers lined the walls. The space itself was adorned with festive tiki torches and comfortable beach furniture. The sound of running water filled the air as water gurgled from rock-decorated fountains. Bright lights illuminated the coral sculptures, leafy tropical plants, and seashells lining the perimeter. Needless to say, the decorations were truly something else.
Ambience
It may have still been fairly chilly outside, and most people were wearing winter jackets and boots, but the atmosphere was unmistakably summertime. Some people were wearing luaus and tossing around inflatable beach balls, while others were lounging about on the white deck chairs set amidst abundant leafy vegetation. Some were watching Finding Nemo inside a lecture hall, and others were playing ping pong or shuffleboard. Live music filled the air, and for one hour—or however long you chose to stay there—it seemed like it was finally summer.
Food
You really can’t go wrong with mac n’ cheese, ribs, potato salad, cole slaw, hot dogs, and pulled pork burgers. This is food for the soul. It’s delicious, it’s filling, and it reminds you of the beach and backyard barbeques in deliciously warm summer evening air—even though you’re actually just sitting on a couch in the Science Center. The root beer floats and scrumptious fruit smoothies further enhanced the tropical and beachy feel of this entire event. And to top it off, there was even cotton candy. Cotton. Candy. The sight of college students enjoying blue mounds of spun sugar is surely enough to bring cheerfulness and thoughts of summertime to anyone’s heart.
Turnout
Fantastic. It seemed like everyone was at Harvard Oasis. The Science Center was absolutely packed, and everyone seemed to be having a genuinely great time.
Overall
A resounding success. Thanks to the Office of the Dean of Student Life, the Undergraduate Council, Harvard College Events Board and the Office of the Dean of Harvard College for all their hard work in making such an amazing event possible. A great break from midterm season, and a fantastic reminder that summer is on its way!
