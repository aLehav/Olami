Fair Harvard has taken sole possession of the spot atop the U.S. News and World Reportâ€™s 2011 rankings of national universities, edging out Princeton, Yale, and, well, every other university in the country.
Last year, Harvard, while ranked number one, shared the honor with Princeton, but this year, Princeton dropped to number two. Yale took the third spot, and Columbia rose from number eight to a respectable number four.
Among the other Ivies, the University of Pennsylvania fared the best at number five. Dartmouth took the ninth spot on the rankings in a three-way tie. Both Brown and Cornell tied at number 15.
