After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 30 years ago, a young man tried to approach a young woman he’d met at a party at Back Bay Station. The woman though, was unimpressed — the two had already met countless times as she served him in the Science Center café on his study breaks from Harvard Law and Business School. That man was Clarence O’Neill “Neil” Brown III ’74 and the woman, Amsale Aberra. She would become not only his wife, but also a famous fashion designer credited with the creation of the “modern wedding dress.”
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Brown reflected on his relationship with Aberra and her career’s arc from a political refugee and college dropout after the deposition of Haile Selassie in her home of Ethiopia, to the owner of a major fashion label.
“Amsale, the company, is probably the longest-operating, Black-owned fashion company that has achieved any sort of international recognition,” he said.
Brown described how when Aberra was first living in America by herself, she was incredibly introverted and struggled to meet the expectations set for her in customer-facing roles. “Her first job was at a Jack in the Box where she got fired because she was too shy and too quiet,” Brown said.
Nevertheless, Aberra’s skillset was clear: her ability to create beautifully unique clothes was incomparable. “Her friends, including me, were always admiring the clothes that she would make herself — then out of necessity,” Brown said.
When the pair tied the knot in 1985, Aberra designed and created her own wedding dress. Brown said this began because she was so disappointed by the styles of the time. She was looking instead for dresses that were “there to complement and accentuate the beauty of the wearer,” not compete with them.
She identified this want in other women, realizing that the current styles were missing a timeless and understated quality.
“She made her own dress and then she says, ‘Look, I can't be the only one who wants something tasteful, refined and more fashionable, so I'm sure there are other girls out here who have similar tastes, so that’s what I want to do,’” Brown said.
When asked if there was any moment in particular that convinced him that Aberra would make it in the world of fashion, Brown referenced the night before their own wedding. Aberra was already designing and constructing her own dress, so her sister had agreed to make the bridesmaids dresses. When the day of the rehearsal came though, the couple discovered that her sister had ended up just getting store-bought gowns for the bridesmaids — gowns that fell into a very specifically ’80s look.
“You remember the Pointer Sisters? These were dresses that looked like the Pointer Sisters and in my head I'm thinking, ‘I’m so excited,’” Brown said, referencing one of the group’s iconic songs.
Rather than complain or throw a fit though, Aberra just sat down and sewed each dress herself the night before her own wedding, doing what needed to be done herself.
“That there told me,” Brown said. “That the night before the wedding, when she's supposed to be relaxing and enjoying being the center of attention, she was focused on getting something done that had to be done and not complaining about it.”
Aberra first tried to place an ad as a custom dress designer, but she faced rejection after rejection. Finally, it was a Black executive at Modern Bride Magazine who was so in awe of Aberra’s work as a Black woman that she convinced her white superiors to print her listing.
For Brown’s part, he had the business expertise — and full-time job — to support Aberra as her own business began to take off.
“What's interesting about small businesses is that you have all the problems of a big business, you just don't have the resources, but you have to figure out how to handle them,” he said.
Amsale’s first big customer came from her meeting with Hedda Kleinfeld Schachter of Kleinfeld Bridal, or “Miss Hedda” as she was more affectionately called. Brown described the scene of complete awe that encompassed the entire store when Kleinfeld’s model walked out in Aberra’s iconic A101 gown.
“The model walked out and all of a sudden the store went silent. You literally could have heard a pin drop,” Brown said.
Kleinfeld picked the collection up on the spot.
What continued to define Aberra’s career was her sheer humility. When being interviewed for her first potential magazine spread at Brides Magazine, the couple’s daughter, Rachel Amsale Brown ’10, was just a toddler. Brown recollected how she began crying in the other room as Aberra tried to conduct her interview. “She says to herself, look, I've already blown this interview, I might as well at least have a happy baby,” Brown said. “She goes, gets the baby, brings Rachel out, holds her in her arms, and continues chatting with the editor with the baby in her arms and it turned out to be her first editorial.”
After a stunning career that spanned over three decades, Amsale passed away in April 2018. The news was a shock to all except her closest family and friends, as Aberra didn’t want “to burden anyone else with her challenge and she didn't want to be treated any differently simply because she was ill.”
Brown recalled the moment when he had to tell their staff that Aberra had passed away; he was full of fear of what would come next. How could he continue the company without its namesake? Should he just continue selling it off?
Instead, Brown found unwavering support in his employees, especially with a show for Amsale’s latest collection set to go on the next week. “What I witnessed was an unbelievable commitment to perpetuating Amsale’s legacy,” he said.
One employee in particular seemed especially distressed by the news, so Brown approached him and asked if he was okay.
“He just looked at me and said, ‘We're gonna need a bigger room.’ I said, ‘What do you mean?’ and he says, ‘That show is gonna be the best show ever.’”
The show went on and as it came to a close, an Ethiopian model walked down the runway in complete silence as the screen behind her came to life and showed Amsale herself, saying goodbye. The model was wearing the original A101 dress that launched Aberra’s career so many years ago.
In the wake of the summer of 2020 and in honor of Amsale’s memory as a trailblazing Black woman and immigrant in fashion, Brown has worked together with the Fashion Institute of Technology, from which Aberra holds a degree, to create Amsale Aspire, “an initiative dedicated to defeating systemic racism in the fashion industry by creating resilient pathways for Black students to develop transformative entrepreneurial skills to build successful businesses and eminent careers.”
Brown said that “three images” in particular made him feel as if action needed to be taken. First, the glaring juxtaposition between the white privilege displayed in the video of Amy Cooper’s interaction with the police and the police-led murder of George Floyd. This disillusionment was then compounded when Brown learned the stark disparity between the average wealth of Black versus white families. According to the Federal Reserve, as of 2019, “Black families' median and mean wealth is less than 15 percent that of white families.”
Having seen atrocities committed against Black people before in his lifetime and having seen the same fire for change dissipate among activists, Brown said he felt “jaded.” His daughter Rachel though, convinced him that this time had to be different, that, “We have to act. We have to do something.”
Amsale was someone “who utilized education, talent, and the support of a network to build a really powerful business,” Brown said. With her as their inspiration, the family set out to right “the disparity between the impact that African Americans have on fashion culture,” and their representation within the industry itself.
“You can’t deny that the essence of popular fashion culture now was derivative of African American style,” Brown said.
Today, Amsale Aspire aims to work with children interested in fashion and design starting in high school, understanding that the path to success begins long before students are even allowed entry into exclusive institutions such as FIT.
“The real goal now is to build partnership with industry to help open those doors, and provide that mentoring, and help provide that wisdom,” Brown said.
“Anyone who has faced a challenge and who's had a dream can be inspired by Amsale’s story,” Brown said.
Through the lives she touched and will continue to shape through Amsale Aspire, Aberra remains an unwavering inspiration within the fashion world and beyond.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square is known for many things — throngs of students, a rich history of artistic and musical exchange, sky-high rents, arguably overpriced yet beloved stationary stores — but the food scene is not necessarily one of them. Still, thousands of hungry people pass through the Square every day, some on their way to class or the office, others headed to rub the pee-shined toe of not-John Harvard himself. Here is our somewhat definitive guide to the various food experiences of Harvard Square, organized roughly by the situation in which each spot might prove most useful.
It’s time to… splurge (reasonably!) and eat well: Orinoco + Maharaja + Dumpling House + Nine Tastes
Tired of cooking yourself the same kind of meals night after night? Hoping to experience some variety that your dining hall can’t offer? Harvard Square is as good a spot as any to mix it up and get a delicious meal you might not have tried before. Tucked away behind other businesses that line JFK Street, Orinoco offers a cozy atmosphere for enjoying delicious Venezuelan cuisine, ranging from arepas and empanadas to South American wines. Right across the street lies The Maharaja, one of Boston’s best Indian restaurants with an extensive menu and a prime view of the Square through their floor-to-ceiling windows. Dumpling House is located a bit farther off of the beaten path, but their fantastic Chinese cuisine makes a trip down Mass. Ave. well worth the walk. Their food is best enjoyed family-style, so get a group together and devour as many dumplings as you can manage! With the recent closure of Spicies, Nine Tastes stands as the preeminent Thai restaurant in Harvard Square. It’s a favorite for takeout among college students, but has a great area for dining in, too.
It’s time to… grab a slice of pizza: Pinocchio’s + Otto’s + &pizza + Source
If you find yourself in Harvard Square with a craving for some good old-fashioned pizza, you are in luck — the area is full of great options. Pinocchio’s is a Cambridge staple, a favorite among Harvard students and locals alike since 1966. Their thick-crust Sicilian style pizza, which they sell by the slice, makes an excellent late-night snack. Don’t sleep on their meatball sub or baked ziti either. For those in search of less traditional flavors, Otto’s offers a wide array of toppings guaranteed to satisfy any niche cravings. Customization is also at the heart of the &pizza experience, as the East Coast chain’s relatively new Cambridge location serves personal-sized pizzas to customers looking for quick and easy takeout. Finally, Source — another new entry into the Harvard Square restaurant scene — is the only pizza spot out of this bunch with a full-service, sit-down dining area, as well as a thriving bar.
It’s time to… enjoy some high-end pub food: Daedalus + The Boathouse + Grafton Street + Russell House 
Food and drink intertwine seamlessly at these Harvard Square establishments. All restaurants are with prominent bars, but they’re also all a step above your typical pub — both in price and quality of food. Daedalus and The Boathouse are next-door neighbors on Mt. Auburn Street, while Russell House and Grafton Street both line JFK Street, making all four of these spots incredibly convenient meeting spots for friends, colleagues, and tourists alike. They each offer tasty variations of American cuisine alongside extensive alcohol selections; Russell House is probably the most popular amongst students, although none of these restaurants would be mistaken for a college bar. They cater to a distinctly more professional crowd. Daedalus stands out as the most expensive, although those looking to splurge on a night out will appreciate the fine dining experience they offer.
It’s time to… get tipsy: Grendel’s Den + Felipe’s + Charlie’s + Wusong Road
No restaurant guide would be complete without highlighting the standout local bars, and Harvard Square has no shortage of establishments that bear mentioning. Grendel’s Den manages to draw a fair number of college students without sacrificing its local Cambridge character; its combination of frequent live music performances, a solid cocktail menu, and satisfying bar food make it worth a visit. Felipe’s might be most famous among Harvard students for its tasty takeout burritos, but it’s also a favorite among local 20-somethings as one of Harvard Square’s most popular bars. When the weather’s good, grab a frozen margarita and enjoy the sunshine on their rooftop patio! Charlie’s Kitchen offers more of a no-frills diner atmosphere, and its beer selection and burger menu are among the best in the area. Newly opened Wusong Road provides scorpion bowls, mai tais, and delicious Chinese-American appetizers at its second-floor Tiki Bar. Read our reviews of Wusong Road here and here.
It’s time to… let someone else pay: Parsnip + Benedetto + Alden & Harlow + Pammy’s + Waypoint + Harvest 
There are plenty of high-end restaurants in the Square, kept perpetually full by a mix of rich visiting parents and suits holding business meetings over a meal. Some are more accessible than others. With an inventive menu built around shareable plates in a New American style, Alden + Harlow is probably the hippest and most centrally-located option of the bunch. Just a few blocks down Mass Ave towards Central Square, the cozy Italian-American spot Pammy’s has made a name for itself with their reinvented prix fixe menu. Make a reservation; they’re usually packed. Waypoint, also overseen by Alden + Harlow executive chef Michael Scelfo, is the way to go for exciting seafood dishes in a dark, vibey seating room. As other four-dollar-sign restaurants have shuttered during the pandemic, the modern New England cuisine at Harvest now carries the mantle for swanky upscale dining in the Square.
It’s time to… take a short walk towards Porter Square: Honeycomb Creamery + Bagelsaurus
Head beyond the outer reaches of Harvard Law School and you have a brief, perfect food adventure just waiting to break up a monotonous weekend in the library. The cult-favorite sourdough bagels and artisanal spreads at Bagelsaurus consistently sell out well before the shop closes at 2pm, so go early and be prepared to wait in line. Eat a bagel, preferably with their uniquely delicious honey rosemary cream cheese; walk around Porter Square if you want; revel. When you’re hungry again (or sooner), walk back towards Harvard Square and stop by Honeycomb Creamery on the way to try their creative seasonal flavors in a warm housemade waffle cone. Thank us for this flawless itinerary later!
It’s time to… eat something that’s vaguely good for you: Veggie Grill + Life Alive + Dig + Sweetgreen + Clover + Playa Bowls
Depending on whether or not one is a devoted patron of these establishments, Harvard Square is either suffering from an epidemic of overpriced fast-casual chains exploiting our inchoate desire for healthy eating or blessed with an abundance of overpriced fast-casual chains concretizing our inchoate desire for healthy eating. (That they are overpriced is a given.) Each scratches a slightly different itch.
The hearty, vegetable-forward bowl options at Dig are not to be confused with the plant-based vegan fare at Veggie Grill, or the ubiquitous Kale Caesars and Harvest Bowls of the genre behemoth that is sweetgreen. But Harvard Square boasts outposts of all three. Less well-known outside of the Boston area, Clover also serves up trendy riffs on vegetarian fast food out of their flagship brick-and-mortar location across from Harvard Yard. Fresh from Central Square and new to the neighborhood is Life Alive, which offers assorted bowls, smoothies, salads, and beverages that are all “good for you and good for the planet” somehow. Finally, Playa Bowls on Mount Auburn Street makes solid acai, pitaya, and green bowls and smoothies.
It’s time to… indulge in a burger: Shake Shack + Tasty Burger + Mr. Bartley’s
Sometimes you just want a burger. Tasty Burger is a Boston stalwart; Shake Shack is a New York import. Both do the trick! Mr. Bartley’s is also an iconic Square establishment, but honestly, we don’t know many Harvard students who have gone here more than once, often during their first visit to campus. It’s worth a trip for the kitschy experience more than the burgers themselves.
It’s time to… sit for a while, or get food to go — these spots do both!: Kong + Bonchon + Saloniki 
These three restaurants have perfected the art of multitasking, operating thriving takeout businesses while offering a solid sit-down dining experience as well. Hong Kong serves fairly typical Americanized Chinese food, with large portions and an expansive menu — perfect for ordering in a group. Besides, their locally famous scorpion bowls are tough to finish alone! Likewise, the heaping servings of Korean fried chicken at Bonchon almost demand to be shared. Saloniki brought Greek food to Harvard Square when it opened in the Smith Campus Center, and while its pitas and plates work great as takeout fare, it offers a spacious dining room and a fully operational bar for those looking to sit down and stay a while.
It’s time to… pick up takeout for a quiet night in: Jefe’s + Le’s + Pokeworks + Falafel Corner
There are countless takeout options to choose from in and around Harvard Square, but these four are among the most popular spots that haven’t been mentioned already. If it’s a burrito you’re after, El Jefe’s has you covered — college students love this place for its late hours (open until 4:00 a.m.!) and its steadfast refusal to charge customers extra for guacamole. Just across the street in the Garage you can find Le’s, a reliable option for Vietnamese cuisine and especially hearty pho. Pokeworks borrows the choose-your-own-toppings approach used by the likes of Subway (also in the Square!) and Chipotle and applies it to poke. Last but not least, Falafel Corner is popular for its reasonably priced falafel and shawarma. Fire up Snackpass and get your order in!
It’s time to… have a coffee and a pastry and maybe splurge on a sandwich: Black Sheep Bagels + Darwins + Pavement + Flour + Tatte + Train Station Dunkin Donuts
Harvard Square is, after all, a college neighborhood — it should be no surprise that it is packed to the brim with coffee shops, each one bringing something unique to the mix. While some iconic local establishments went out of business under pandemic pressure — we’ll never forget you, Café Pamplona — most of the franchised outposts have persevered. Black Sheep Bagels boasts the tastiest bagels to be found right in the Square and a solid roster of espresso drinks to accompany them. Darwin’s, a Cambridge-area staple, has not one, not two, but three locations in the area; the one on Putnam Avenue, with its expensive yet delicious sandwiches, strong coffee, and cozy decor, is often affectionately called the Mather Darwin’s for its proximity to the undergraduate House. While the bagels at Pavement rival Black Sheep’s, convenience is what draws frequent long lines of caffeine-hungry students: The café takes Crimson Cash and is located in the Smith Campus Center. Flour Bakery, founded by a Harvard alumna, offers locally famous pastries alongside a great selection of sandwiches and caffeinated beverages — their caramel pecan sticky buns alone are worth a visit. Pulling double duty in the Capitol One bank space on JFK Street and around the corner on Mount Auburn, Peet’s Coffee works as a trusty (and perhaps superior, not to mention historically antecedent) Starbucks alternative. Zinneken’s specializes in bespoke Belgian waffles and is perfect for a quiet study session or an afternoon first date. If you’re looking to indulge in a more upscale breakfast, Tatte sells a wide variety of coffee, tea, breakfast foods, and bakery items in their spacious, elegant storefront in the heart of the Square. For caffeine-seekers on the go, it’s hard to do better than the Dunkin Donuts underground location in the Harvard MBTA station for efficient service and a taste of one of Boston’s greatest exports. For a taste of local culture with a dash of infrastructure, it’s truly the finest Harvard Square has to offer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kid Cudi fans from far and wide traveled to this year’s Governor’s Ball for one thing and one thing only: to catch the “Man on the Moon” rapper’s headlining performance. The Cleveland-born rapper did not disappoint, delivering an emotional performance that left the audience in awe.
Getting right down to business, Cudi kicked off the show with the bangers “Tequila Shots,” “She Knows This,” and “Dive” from his 2020 album “Man on the Moon III: The Chosen.” The album features themes of loneliness related to the passing of Cudi’s father from cancer. That autobiographical lense revealed a vulnerable and sensitive side to the rapper, making the live performance extra special. Cudi could be seen bowing down in prayer as the song’s guitar riff took over, caught in the sentimentality of the moment. The thematic backgrounds enhanced these special moments, with neon outlines of city lights and girls dancing on the LED screen reminiscent of the album’s iconic cover art.
“I have a lot of fun doing this ‘Man on the Moon III’ shit. But ain’t nothing like this shit,” Cudi said as a transition to “REVOFEV” from “Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager.” This segue completely transformed the atmosphere of the show. The melancholy and somber vibe evaporated, giving way to something more raw and energetic. In performing tracks like “Marijuana,” Mr. Rager himself amped up, jamming out on stage as his signature crooning yell resonated throughout the main GOVBALLNYC stage.
“Hit me,” Cudi said repeatedly, taking no time to relax between songs to maximize the time spent performing. The display matched his speed, with animated weed and trippy dog skeletons flashing behind the artist to foster the hallucinogenic experience.
All day Friday, the rumor going around was that Travis Scott was originally supposed to come out to perform with Kid Cudi prior to the Astroworld tragedy. Whether it was true or just gossip remains a mystery, because Cudi actually brought out King Chip to perform “Just What I Am.” The rapper dedicated the song to his late mother before diving into the first verse.
Cruising further down memory lane, Cudi revisited his 2009 debut album “Man on the Moon: The End of Day” with “Up Up & Away,” trippy hand mana designs flashing on screen. “We haven’t even gotten to the rage section of the show,” Cudi said as a lead into “GHOST!” The self-proclaimed “master of ceremonies” embodied pure rage as he performed tracks like “Mr. Rager.”. The impulsive, split personality of Cudi as Mr. Rager was brought to life, as Cudi took on the role model with slightly altered lyrics like “This is dedicated to all of the fucked up kids like me” engulfing the crowd in a relatable and inclusive environment.
The few minutes of his set that were not dedicated to singing were spent interacting with the fans. Cudi walked across stage, pointing out fans that went wild at being noticed by their idol. “I love you too,” he blew kisses into the crowd. “Y’all feel that shit?” he asked, spurring on screams and howls. “Doing this for my bro Travis Scott. Sing this shit loud, loud, loud,” he said, driving the crowd into a frenzy before singing “THE SCOTTS.”
Considering the sky high expectations on top of the pressure of headlining the first day of a festival, Kid Cudi shined in the spotlight.
He effortlessly handled the difficult task of energizing the crowd like he was born for the stage, made to perform for thousands. More importantly, he weaved a narrative through his discography, making this setlist special and distinct from album stadium tours. Add to that the thematic display paralleling the narrative in his lyrics, and it’s clear that Cudi’s performance was a cinematic experience made for a festival like Governors Ball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year's Governors Ball was special for many. Fans get to see some of their all time favorite performers for the first time in years. Performing at New York’s Citi Field in 2022 was also a first for some of the artists too. The Crimson sent two reporters, Alisa Regassa and Derrick Ochiaga, to cover the event of many firsts. These are a few performances that stood out on the opening day of the three day festival.
Paris Texas
As Friday’s unforgiving afternoon sun scorched festival goers at the Bacardí stage, rap duo Paris Texas brought extra heat with their performance. The LA rap group started their set strong with “CASINO,” amping up the crowd so quickly that a huge mosh pit formed only two songs into the set. As rapper Felix and producer Louie Pastel strolled across the stage, they shared that one of their mothers was in the crowd, encouraging the audience to get hyped so that she wouldn’t send them back to school. Their comical, free-spirited stage presence appealed to the masses, but it was really their high energy that got the people going during their most popular hits like “FORCE OF HABIT” and “SITUATIONS.”
Coi Leray
Next, the Bacardí stage welcomed Coi Leray opener DJ_JSTACKZ, who played hits like “Super Gremlin” by Kodak Black and “m.A.A.d city” by Kendrick Lamar to hype up the crowd. The rapper stepped out dressed in a red skin-tight two-piece and huge sunglasses, an entourage of dancers at her back. Leray proved to be a tireless performer, busting out dance-intensive choreography throughout the set. During songs like “Thief In The Night” she took it down low twerking while the LED display featured snippets from her music videos. “If you got a sneaky link make some noise” she teased before launching into the track “Sneaky Link,” where she did the jerk to the beat drop. The rapper interacted with her crowd in every spare moment, with phrases like “I love the east coast!” during the chorus of BFB Da Packman’s “Ocean Prime,” as well as starting to chant “Free YSL” before the song “Slide” featuring Gunna. She even invited a fan on stage for a lapdance to “What’s My Name.” Leray winded down the set with crowd favorites “No More Parties,” “TWINNEM,” and “Blick Blick,” having fun with it by screaming the adlib “fa-la-la-la-la-la.”
Black Pumas
Over on the main GOVBALLNYC stage, the Texas soul band Black Pumas cooled the sizzling day with their chill vibes. Donning his signature fedora and sunnies ensemble, group songwriter and lead singer Eric Burton started off the set with “I’m Ready” and “Know You Better.” The live performance of these tracks was extended by Burton’s vocal improvisations and accompanied by producer Adrian Quesada’s guitar riffs. Burton strutted along the walkway during musical interludes to interact with fans, while backup vocalist Angela Miller took to the tambourine. “He looks ready. She looks ready,” Burton said of several front row festival goers, before getting them involved in singing the ad libs in “Black Moon Rising.” They closed out the set with their most popular hit “Colors,” during which the band broke out in dance while Burton showed off his vocal range, the crowd singing along to every word.
