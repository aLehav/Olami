After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will establish the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability to advance the University’s commitment to climate-oriented research and foster a hub for collaborative studies, the University announced Tuesday.
Made possible by a $200 million donation from Melanie Salata and Jean E. Salata, the Institute will aim to connect ongoing climate undertakings at the University, as well as drive forward novel projects such as the Climate Research Clusters Program — a faculty-led initiative designed to connect affiliates across campus with collaborative and interdisciplinary climate-oriented research opportunities.
Jean Salata is the chief executive and founding partner of Baring Private Equity Asia. With a net worth north of $5 billion, he recently handed the reins of the Asian private equity giant to the firm EQT in a $7.5 billion deal in March.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow lauded the Salatas’ donation as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” in the Tuesday announcement, noting the urgency of tackling present-day climate issues.
“It will draw together expertise from across the university in ways we’ve only just begun to imagine,” Bacow said in the statement. “Melanie and Jean’s extraordinary generosity is matched only by their passionate belief that the time is now for bold action that engages the public. We are grateful beyond measure for their vision and for their support as we undertake critical work on behalf of humanity—and for the sake of our planet.”
The $200 million comes in the wake of donations from other billionaires for climate-oriented buildings and initiatives at universities across the country. In May, billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr announced, alongside his wife Ann Doerr, a $1.1 billion donation to Stanford University to create a school focused on climate change and sustainability. Four months earlier, Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan ’07 donated $50 million to the University of Hawaii for research on oceanic climate change.
Certain ongoing University initiatives will be redirected to the Salata Institute come fall 2022, according to the announcement. The Climate Change Solutions Fund, established by former University President Drew G. Faust in 2014 with the goal of researching methods to mitigate the impact of fossil fuel-based energy, will now be facilitated through the new institute. The institute will also aim to connect affiliates with climate leaders across the private, public, and nonprofit sectors, as well as helm the charge to recruit faculty with climate expertise.
“This is a momentous step for Harvard’s efforts in climate and sustainability,” stated Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability Jim Stock, who will lead the Salata Institute as its director, in the announcement. “The Salata Institute will be the key institutional structure driving the University’s goals in climate: to increase research, education, and public engagement that makes a real difference in tackling the climate crisis.”
The institute will also provide opportunities for students interested in exploring careers in climate and sustainability through internships and research, expanding opportunities through the University’s Center for the Environment.
The Salatas stated they hope to help create a more sustainable future and address climate change, which they cited as having generational consequences.
“Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time,” the Salatas said in the announcement. “It is a crisis whose impact will affect our children and many generations to come, and we have a responsibility to them to do everything we can to address it.”
The Salata Institute will launch in fall 2022.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ninety students from Harvard and MIT penned an open letter Wednesday calling on the schools to eliminate their carbon emissions.
The letter expressed support for Cambridge’s proposed Green New Deal legislation while criticizing the two universities’ push to use global carbon offsets to satisfy the proposed emission reductions without paying compliance fees.
Cambridge is currently considering an amendment to the city’s Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance that would require owners of large properties to either reduce carbon emissions or pay $234 per metric ton of excess emissions, with the goal of reaching net-zero emissions from large buildings by 2035.
Harvard and MIT, however, are seeking a third option to meet the proposed requirement: global carbon offsets — purchased credits that fund carbon reductions elsewhere in the world.
The open letter described the impact of the offsets as “questionable at best,” saying the schools must reduce emissions in Cambridge to have a meaningful impact.
“There is a legitimate way to avoid paying the 234 dollar fee: by eliminating your carbon emissions,” the letter reads. “Because with your billion-dollar endowments, attempting to cut corners is irresponsible and dangerous. And as tuition-paying students, we will not accept it.”
The proposal is currently being assessed by the Ordinance Committee of the Cambridge City Council. If approved, the amendment will proceed to the full council.
During ordinance meetings in February and April, representatives for MIT and Harvard advocated for language in the proposal that would allow carbon offsets to satisfy emission reduction requirements.
Representatives for the schools also questioned whether the city’s power grid could support the proposed 2035 timetable.
The universities in April, along with several other Cambridge organizations, submitted proposed revisions to the November 2021 amendment requesting that global carbon credits be permitted to offset 100 percent of organizations’ carbon emissions under the BEUDO.
The committee has not adopted the revisions, though the language is subject to change.
Owen O. Ebose ’25, one of the students who drafted the letter, said he opposes the use of offsets as they would allow Harvard and MIT to “continue the status quo” while failing to address the climate crisis locally.
“We can offset our emissions as much as we want, but to actually address the climate crisis, we need to bring our emissions to zero,” Ebose said. “They are trying to deflect instead of truly embrace their responsibility to actually reduce their emissions.”
The $234 per metric ton fee could be seen as a “local carbon offset,” Ebose said. According to the Council’s proposed amendment, these funds will be dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions within Cambridge.
Ebose added that some global carbon offsets are “significantly cheaper” than the compliance fee, however — as low as $20 per metric ton. Nonetheless, Harvard would be able to “claim reductions” in its carbon footprint under the University’s proposed revisions, argues the letter.
In an email Thursday, University spokesperson Amy Kamosa declined to comment on the letter, but wrote that Harvard is committed to climate sustainability efforts, citing the University’s established goals to become fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050.
Harvard failed to reduce on-campus greenhouse gas emissions between 2016 and 2020, according to the most recent data from the University. Still, Harvard officials maintain the school is on track to meet its 2026 and 2050 goals.
According to Kamosa, the 2026 goal is intended to reduce global emissions in the near future while working toward long-term reductions in on-campus emissions.
Henry Lee ’68, a member of Harvard’s Presidential Committee on Sustainability, said that while offsets are “extremely controversial,” they are necessary for the University to reach its climate goals while maintaining active development on campus and expansion efforts in Allston.
“Harvard was clearly not going to be able to do this by direct reduction of their own use,” Lee said. “Its expansion of the campus, its new projects — the emissions from those offset most of the reductions that it made.”
Lee, who co-chaired a subcommittee examining Harvard’s fossil fuel neutrality goal, said he and other faculty members developed guidelines on selecting offsets. The criteria include ensuring the credits support innovative work aligned with the University’s research goals, and that they generate new carbon reduction initiatives — as opposed to funding those which have already taken place, he said. He added that the University will likely purchase offsets in accordance with these criteria in 2023 and 2024.
Owen Leddy, a Ph.D. candidate at MIT who signed the letter, said verifying the efficacy of offsets is often unfeasible in practice.
“One of the things that’s really challenging about global offsets is verifying that the offset is actually meaningfully reducing emissions,” Leddy said. “Often those greenhouse gas emissions — those projects that offsets are supposed to fund — would have happened anyway without the offset being paid for.”
Councilors met with representatives from Harvard and MIT in a closed-door meeting last Thursday. The Council’s ordinance committee is set to hold a public comment session on Wednesday, during which the BEUDO amendment will be discussed.
The session was initially scheduled for May 25 but was canceled due to a lack of councilor attendance.
Leddy said he hopes many residents sign up to speak in support of the proposed Green New Deal legislation during Wednesday’s meeting.
“I think it’s especially important for members of the MIT and Harvard community to speak up,” Leddy said. “At the moment, the MIT and Harvard administrations are a very loud voice in the ears of City Council.”
