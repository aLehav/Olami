After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania—To say The Barnes Foundation’s move from the suburban Merion, PA to Benjamin Franklin Parkway in downtown Philadelphia wasn’t easy would be gross understatement; it entailed a nearly decade-long legal battle to maneuver around the strict provisions in the trust of the late Albert C. Barnes, a pharmaceuticals magnate who spent his vast fortune on a trove of artwork that includes a dizzying number of Renoirs, Matisses, and Picassos.
But Barnes wanted his collection to remain just as he had left it forever more: arranged carefully into “ensembles,” with paintings hung from floor to ceiling in symmetrical designs, accented with antique metal door hinges like big, dark bullet points. Although the collection has moved, its layout has been meticulously recreated. Not a single 18th century chest or case of African masks is out of place.
One goes to the Barnes not merely to admire the masterpieces, but to have an Experience. And so, for the most part, visitors are happy to crane their necks and squint their eyes in order to best examine Van Goghs situated in uncomfortably tight corners or Prendergasts above door frames.
I, though, soon slumped on a bench, audio guide paused, gazing into the middle distance between myself and a wall of Renoirs which my thirteen year-old companion, Fiona, called “too peachy.” Perhaps I was tired from the early morning train ride. Or perhaps my summer internship at an art gallery had spoiled me. Just the previous afternoon, I had been standing alone with a Monet, my fingers skimming its surface as I took its dimensions with a tape measure.
The Barnes, an Experience to which I had been looking forward for months, seemed suddenly like much ado about, well, a lot of peachy Renoirs. Yes, the Barnes has its share--or more than its share--of masterpieces, but they are crowded together like so many gilt-framed sardines.
The next morning, my parents suggested we kill a few hours before our train back to New York visiting the Shofuso Japanese House and Garden in West Fairmount Park. Only a handful of other visitors had braved the sticky afternoon heat to explore Shofuso, and so we had the place mostly to ourselves. A cheery docent answered our questions, fanning herself against the swelter. When we ran out of things to ask, she left us to our thoughts.
As I stood at the edge of the koi pond, tossing in bits of fish food, I forgot, for a moment, that I was at a tourist site, where admission costs $4 for students and chopsticks go for $3 in the gift shop. The only things on my mind were the July sun and the graceful white and orange backs of the koi as they raised their lips to meet my offerings.

PISA, Italy—There is no view quite like this one—and I’m not talking about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. I’m talking about the swarms of tourists milling around, posing with the aforementioned crooked piece of architecture.
To be honest, I hadn’t really been planning to make the trip to Pisa just to see this oft-mentioned tourist attraction. It had never held any real appeal for me. It wasn’t as steeped in the history and culture and everyday residential life that I was looking forward to seeing in other cities, and I had fully intended on going straight from Florence to Rome. However, after being in Florence for a few days with two friends, 50 euros, and one traveler we had picked up in Venice, our new friend, whom we had known for all of 24 hours, convinced us to accompany him to the train station so that he could look up times for his own journey.
Ten minutes and a panicked sprint to the platform later, the four of us were aboard a slow-moving train, which was carefully chugging along the hilly Italian countryside toward the small town of Pisa, Italy.
Upon arrival, my first thought had nothing to do with the tower itself, but more with the half-zoo, half-circus that was taking place on the nearby green. There were those leaning against nothing but the air, pretending to “rest” against the tower at the exact angle of that famous lean. There were those lying on their backs, feet in the air, single-handedly keeping the tower from falling over. Couples posed in a cutesy “tug-of-war” over the tower pose. Parents held their babies in a fashion suggesting the infants were sitting on the tower. And of course, there were those repeatedly squatting and leaping into the air, attempting to capture the perfect “jumping picture” when the click of the camera aligns with the moment that one’s hands are triumphantly raised and one’s legs are bent elegantly and one’s body floats above the solid earth.
The tower itself was just the backdrop. The prop in a school play. The setting for some prom pictures. The Christmas sweater pulled out of the closet once a year for holiday photo shoots.
It’s hard to describe the pandemonium and absurdity of it all, but just as I was about to get on my high horse and self-righteously lecture to my friends about the touristy nature of the place, I noticed my friend lying on the ground, camera aimed upwards, beckoning for me to stand in front of her.
“I want you to do a jumping shot,” she said.
I opened my mouth to say no. I was about to say no. I almost said no. But there is something to be said about acting like a tourist sometimes, to let loose and admit to everyone around you the novelty of certain things. So, I closed my mouth and did as she asked.
After all, I am tourist—and I got my jumping shot.

ROME, Italy—Grawemeyer Hall is a red brick building in the University of Louisville reminiscent of the Neo-Georgian works that sprung up during the United States’ colonial days. Its rotunda is said to be inspired by the Jeffersonian Rotunda in the University of Virginia—a circularred brick building preceded by a porch made of columns and a triangular pediment. While that may be true, the architectural design has a much older origin that can be found in the Pantheon in Rome.
During my recent visit to Rome I was fascinated by the Pantheon’s geometric symbiosis, using the sphere and cube to represent a harmony between the heavens and the earth. In my eyes Grawemeyer Hall ceased being a university building and instead became the offspring of an ancient monument adapted to fit its new environment.
I began seeing architectural similarities in the buildings surrounding me. Features such as Corinthian columns flanking an entrance, a floral relief ornamenting the side of a wall, and curved pediments coveringoval windows can be found throughout Louisville, all manifestations of architectural elements developed during the ancient world.
Certainly, they do not hold the ethos a building acquires once it has reached a certain level of antiquity. But these buildings do embody histories of faraway lands from a time long ago. By using architectural elements of the past, they create memories without an origin, promote an understanding of beauty that we no longer understand, and connect us to a past that was never our own.

BRUSSELS, Belgium—It’s 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning, and Brussels is still sleeping.
As I exit the metro, I forgo my usual walk-sprint up the escalator and instead let the city appear slowly before my eyes, like a drop of water spreading across a sheet of paper. At least that’s what it would have been like if I had looked to the left. As it turns out, my first Belgian landmark is not the regal architectural styling of the Bourse, home of the former Brussels Stock Exchange. Instead, I spot a Pizza Hut, filling me with repentance for the many tacky sins of my country.
Desperate for an aesthetic palate cleansing, I wander down a grungy cobbled sidewalk lined with shuttered shops and find myself alone in the Grand Place, the central square of Brussels. My footsteps echo as I walk haltingly towards the city hall (Hôtel de Ville in French or Stadhuis in Dutch), trying to simultaneously take in the meticulous Gothic detailing of the façade and the transcendent awe of the colossal middle tower. In lieu of the insightful historical commentary that my friends would have provided had they been with me, two very simple thoughts cross my mind.
First: somebody built this! Many people, in fact! With their hands! Without a crane! The sheer feat of having constructed a building of this size without any modern machinery stretches far beyond my comprehension. Never mind the artistry of carving every unique figure on the façade, the fact that this building exists and still stands after hundreds of years renders even my reverence small and insignificant.
Second, I am extremely smug about having the Grand Place all to myself. Tranquilly pacing several laps around the square definitely makes up for any lingering crankiness I may have had about catching the 6 a.m. train from Paris. I am the only tourist here, and boy am I smug about it.
But not for long. Though I may not be able to identify the specific Gothic architectural style of the Hôtel, two years at Harvard have trained me to recognize the unmistakable shuffling of many running sneakered feet and the eager snap of unwieldy SLRs. A Chinese tour group has ventured excitedly into the square.
Summer me, however, is a much kinder species than my school-year alter ego, so instead of barrelling brusquely across irritating peace sign snapshots, I welcome the sight of these tourists. In fact, the obnoxious chatter of Cantonese fills my ears with the welcome cacophony of home. I ask one of them to take my picture in front of the Hôtel (the perpetual plight of the lone traveler), and my heart fills with an overwhelming delight as he crouches down in the familiar Asian photographer squat.
It’s 8:45 a.m. on a Saturday morning, Brussels is crossly rubbing its eyes, and I walk swiftly out of the Grand Place to get to the Manneken Pis before the rest of the Asian tourists do.

OLYMPIA, Greece—“You’re still here? Why?” The shopkeeper was startled as we approached his souvenir stand for a second day in a row. Every day, he watches tourists peruse his collection of knock-off sunglasses and “It’s all Greek to Me!” t-shirts. Rarely does he ever see those faces again.
“How long are you guys here?” the shopkeeper asked.
“Three weeks. We’re taking a class.” I responded.
He laughed.
Olympia is that small. A scattering of souvenir shops and cafes cafés cluster around one archaeological sight, the main attraction. Mammoth tour buses flood the streets with eager tourists who snap their photos of Zeus’s temple before speeding off to their next location that same day. At first, I envied them as they uploaded their pictures to Facebook, crossed Olympia off their lists, and embarked on new travel adventures.
However, I am starting to think that three weeks here will not be enough. After a night spent at Zorba’s, our favorite (okay, only) local bar, we began the grueling trek up the hill to our hotel. As we reached the familiar curve in the path, someone casually suggested, “Let’s go that way.” A small set of stairs was barely visible under the overgrown brush. Maybe it was the adventurous spirit of the night, or, more likely, it was just Zorba’s cheap wine hitting us, but we mounted the stairs and made our way up.
We found ourselves in a gigantic amphitheater, which somehow felt bigger than the entire town itself. The stairs placed us in the middle of the stage, marveling at the magnificent stone stadium seats in front of us. We burst out laughing.
Every time I pass those obscured stairs, chat with the storekeeper on the corner, or make the trek to Zorba’s, I feel bad for the tourists racing away on their buses, missing the quirky spirit and hidden treasures of an incredible town.

MOSHI, Tanzania—I have been Buddhist all my life, at least for as long as I can remember.
And yet, on our first Sunday morning in Moshi, Tanzania, I decided to go to church.
Moshi on a Sunday morning was hardly recognizable. The market stalls were tucked away like closedkitchen cabinets and no salesman was shouting about his wares with impressive gusto. Our footsteps echoed on the ground as we made our way to the second roundabout—about a mile’s walk from our hotel. The church was something spectacular to behold, mostly because its walls and edifice were formed by the swaying arms and hands of the people, not a pristinely kept altar or mahogany pews.
It was 8:27 a.m. Perfect. The mass would start at 8:30am, and my Lonely Planet Guide had promised thatall were welcome and that, religious or not, the traditional “chagga” singing is something we wouldn’t want to miss. We made our way through the white gates and down the elongated pathway towards the building. The church’s seating area consisted of many thin wooden benches and multicolored plastic chairs set up in concentric circles around the trees. We spotted a shady spot under a nearby birch and plopped down, excited for what was to come in approximately two—no, one minute.
An hour passed.
Perhaps I should interject here with a brief explanation about punctuality in Tanzania. It is more of anamorphous concept that is politely nodded at, rather than something actually observed. But if one hour should always bring as much awe and appreciation as it brought us, than maybe all events and ceremonies should begin with an expected one hour delay. We soaked in everything. Music floated from a nearby speaker system and wrapped itself around the brightly colored orange, yellow, and white flags hanging over our heads. As the minutes passed by, more and more small children began to surround our little section of wooden benches. The girls turned their beautifully shaved heads toward us and swished past with their yellow, blue, and red pleated skirts. The boys sported mischievous grins and threw furtive glances in our direction. Though they sat in their seats as their mothers had directed them, I could tell that their minds were positively whirring with curiosity. As we soon realized, we had inadvertently sat down in the children’s section. Fortuitous, I guess.
When the service began, I rose to my feet with the rest of the Tanzanian congregation and tapped my feet and clapped my hands to music that had no care in the world whether I was Christian or Buddhist or whatever. It wrapped its arms around me as I stood there swaying and clapping my hands with a rhythmthat felt familiar though I had never heard it before. This was chagga singing—a traditional, cultural expression of what it feels like to believe in something higher than yourself.
Embraced by chagga singing and a common sense of humanity and humility, I couldn’t describe the way I felt during my time at the church in Moshi other than as simply and inexplicably blessed.

DELHI, India—Midnight in Delhi swallows all light except the dim glow collected by headlights rushing down the highway out of the airport. From the window of the taxi—we're sitting three in the front, and I'm squished against the left door, all my hair flying out the open window—I can only make out the faint outline of some gates, officials on the dark sidewalks, construction sites, trees. Even at this time, it's 40 degrees Celsius.
I focus on the street for a better view: flashing lights on the side of the road by the guard-rail as a warning, rickshaws, bikers, and every few seconds someone crossing amid oncoming traffic. This is action-movie, video-game-swerving past trucks and through other cars that speed towards each other from opposite directions. The honking is constant and substitutes for traffic signals. I should be terrified, but it's so surreal that all I can think about is how absolutely incredible it is—how impossible—that a few hours ago I was literally hurled through the air at hundreds of miles an hour, crossing an ocean and an entire continent, to land here on somewhat more solid ground. How ridiculous, and how almost insane, it is to travel at all—as a truck speeds by, a few curled up bodies asleep on its roof.
I think of where where those men are headed, if they know any better than I do. The truck disappears just as quickly in the darkness, and I wonder how much travel—the rush, the speed, the blind focus on an endpoint—will let me see.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—I was lost and trying to find my way out of the woods during a jog along the Potamac last year when I saw fireflies for the first time. I had crossed a footbridge onto a small, unkempt haven of luscious plant life called Theodore Roosevelt Island when I witnessed the first abrupt flicker.
Wow, I thought, isn’t that something?
Wandering along the unpaved path, I knew—or rather, remembered—that this is what it felt like to believe in magic. I grew so distracted by the beautiful flashes that I accidentally ran up on a deer before realizing I should  make my way back toward Georgetown before dark.
The same sensation overcame me the first time I walked by the Lincoln Memorial—also last year—when I found it lit from all directions, standing upright in the dramatic glow of nationalism. A gentle twinge of captivation took over and I stared on, fascinated, perplexed, uncomplicated.
Coming back to DC this summer, I expected my stupid bewilderment at the fireflies and the light-works to dissipate, but here I am a month into my stay and my jaw still drops in childish bewilderment every time I see a firefly or a dramatic display of lights.
Sure, these reactions—to fireflies and monuments, to nature and patriotism, to magic and might—betray my pretense for thoughtfulness and my aspiration toward nuance. No, I don’t believe in magic. And I am always suspicious of the too-easy relationship between art and nationalism.
But given a display of pretty lights, I look on mindlessly and effortlessly.
