After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is anger, there is rage, and then there is the comment section of YouTube.
Misspelled expletives run wild. Capitalization is reversed: The first letter of a sentence is lower case, but everything else screams in all caps. One exclamation point is never enough.
It’s easy to condemn the world of YouTube commenters and never think about why this world exists or what it means. This lack of reflection is too bad, really, because the mere existence of such a well-defined YouTube culture has a lot to say about us—our values, our insecurities.
First, let’s acknowledge that the YouTube comment section is not unique. Sure, the level of vitriol is abnormal, but the crucial fact is that YouTube has a characteristic user culture. We can stereotype the website as a place of elaborate insults and avant-garde punctuation because these attributes are so consistent.
You could drum up a dozen other examples of separate website cultures. Yahoo Answers users are earnest but clueless, Humans of New York users are sentimental, SoundCloud users are appreciative, Quora users are academic, and so on. (Even commenters on The Crimson website have notable characteristics; readers can hash out that identity on their own.)
In the physical world, you can impersonate nationalities: Tell me to pretend I’m French, and I’ll produce a baguette and a bad accent. The same is true in the virtual world, except with websites instead of nations.
Step aside for a moment and consider the seriousness of this observation. You can be whatever you want on the Internet, and yet so many people have chosen to become the same thing.
Here lies a total chasm between what the Internet seems to be and what it is. Everyone has heard the interpretation of the Internet as the last frontier for free expression. It is the Wild West without tumbleweed, a place where you can truly redefine yourself.
We expect a haven for free expression, but we get a structured society in which being connected virtually means self-sorting into a pre-existing group identity. So much for individuality: Internet users are pulled towards conventionality.
The signs are all around us. Memes, geek culture, YouTube celebrities like Key & Peele, the incredible popularity of a select few websites—all these widespread characteristics suggest the virtual world is a place of well-known favorites, not hidden gems.
Not that conventionality is an apocalyptic outcome—after all, we the users created it. YouTube could theoretically be a forum for intellectual discussion in addition to “first” posts. Only the decisions of commenters prevent this outcome.
At the same time, you have to wonder how conscious these decisions really are. Most Internet websites prioritize popularity. The most liked Facebook photos appear on your newsfeed; the most read articles drift to the top of a news website. It is more difficult to buck the expected current and strike out on your own idiosyncrasies.
Outside of website structure, our psychology pulls us to sacrifice personality for belonging.  We need groups because being an individual is lonely enough. We don’t have the same fundamental urge for uniqueness. Nowhere is it clearer than on the Internet that when push comes to shove, human beings prioritize easy community over lonely individuality.
As usual, the final stop for this train of thought is Harvard University. Have you ever heard of a college student fronting in order to fit into a group? (Now imagine the self-adjustments that Facebook users make when commenting in different groups.) Do you ever walk into a dining hall and notice three self-sorted tables of distinct communities? (Now imagine users from Reddit, Yahoo Answers, and BuzzFeed sitting side by side.)
Admittedly, belonging to a community in actual life involves more complex factors than I’m acknowledging. However, if we want to begin to understand such real-world dynamics, we might start by considering why User325 is writing in all caps beneath his favorite YouTube video.

Twenty-five dead, an undisclosed number of artifacts destroyed. I overhear a beloved professor sigh, “The world I study is quickly disappearing.” The table shares a moment of silence.
When terrorists destroy mosaics and statues along with human lives—as occurred in the attack on the National Bardo Museum in Tunis on March 19th—which loss do I feel more keenly?
It isn’t the people, at least not at first. God commands me to love my neighbor as myself, and I strive to do so. However, the less I know of any one person’s intricate beauty—the lilt of their voice, the pathways of their mind—the less I feel moved to love them. Perhaps loving doesn’t always require the right feelings. If I donate time and money to at-risk communities, who cares if my heart’s really in it? But I don’t do those things, at least not the way I would if I were to grasp fully the value of a human life, to feel in my bones the cost of its abuse.
Through my study of the classics more than anything else, I teach my heart to love its neighbor. With my head in a book, I come face to face with the dead. Though they may not know it, I am with them, celebrating their victories, lamenting their downfalls. During spring break, I stood in a quarry where 10,000 Athenian soldiers once were starved to death. I couldn’t save them when they needed it, but I could put my hands on the walls that enclosed them. My attempt at saving the lost is a tribute, even if it is futile. My hand feels the stone. Their hands felt the stone. Apart from the span of two millennia, we’re practically kissing.
Like every relationship, these have their pitfalls. Sometimes I wonder why I bother to love the people who can’t love back. Sometimes the barrage of feigned understanding puts a strain on this long distance bond: “Oh, you study Latin? That will be so helpful in learning medical or legal terms (so you can do something in the world of the living, you know, the only one that matters)!” In time, I’ve learned to forgive my fellow man for misunderstanding a love he does not inhabit.
Sometimes cultural differences flare up. To borrow Eve Tushnet’s phrasing, we study history best when we manage to do so with “a humble willingness to take dead people on their own terms.” Speaking from experience, that’s incredibly difficult. How do you take a misogynistic slave-owner on his own terms? And yet, without attempting to do so, there is no study of history. From learning how to accept the ancients for who they were, I gain empathy, which brings me around again to the point I’m trying to make: Studying classics teaches me how to love strangers.
When 25 people whom I have never met die, I am sorry. Having peeked into the lives of so many irreplaceable souls, I know how to gesture so as to make out before my eyes a rough sketch of the 25 faces I will never know. And as I come to better understand the visage of the lost, I hope this article sheds light on why, for me, human lives are not the only casualty of this attack. These objects, they do something. They allow for study of the dead, and the study of the dead unlocks the heart to persons unknown.

Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gants recently gave a bold forecast for the Commonwealth’s criminal justice system. He predicted that the Massachusetts would soon abolish mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, and threw his own support behind ending the practice. Despite significant opposition from some district attorneys, Chief Justice Gants’ comments and Massachusetts’ current review of its sentencing guidelines are positive steps toward reforming a system that has too little an effect on public safety in its current form.
At the core of Gants’ argument for the abolition of mandatory minimum sentences is their basic unfairness. As he put it, mandatory minimums can treat “a drug runner the same as a kingpin” and “a defendant motivated by addiction the same as those motivated by predatory greed.” This one-size-fits-all policy inhibits the ability of judges to determine appropriate punishments. Moreover, as Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins points out, mandatory minimums often have a disastrous effect on the families of low-level drug offenders.
Tompkins, who is in favor of abolishing mandatory minimums, has also pointed to the enormous fiscal costs of the policy. He estimates that it costs an average of $46,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate. According to Northeastern law professors Daniel Medwed and Michael Meltsner, the state-wide average was around $53,040. Spending these sums and more to incarcerate nonviolent offenders who would not have been imprisoned otherwise is simply unreasonable.
In addition to eroding the judiciary’s discretionary authority and incurring a substantial cost to tax payers, the current regime of mandatory minimums is rife with racial disparities. As Gants pointed out, in 2013, minorities made up 32 percent of convicted drug offenders, yet 75 percent of those convicted with mandatory minimums.
At the very least, Massachusetts should revise its approach such that its mandatory minimum sentences reflect good public policy. Reducing mandatory minimums for drug offenses so that they are more reflective of these transgressions nonviolent character would go a long way towards ensuring that nonviolent offenders are not put behind bars for unnecessary lengths of time. So, too, would expanding the scope of judicial discretion in applying such sentences.
The current regime of mandatory drug sentencing in Massachusetts, and nation-wide, has proven unjust and fiscally draining. With support from judges and law enforcement officials, as well as an ongoing review of the state’s sentencing guidelines to draw upon, Massachusetts legislators have never had a better opportunity to begin reforming the state’s minimum sentences. They should not pass it up.

Boston University had pledged to fund the final $8.33 million needed to build a new commuter rail station on Harvard-owned property in Allston, according to a letter obtained by The Boston Globe, but the deal was never finalized.
Announced last September, the “West Station” project will connect Allston to the existing Framingham/Worcester line, which originates at South Station. Harvard and the state had each agreed then to cover one third of the $25 million project cost, but the Massachusetts Department of Transportation was unable to secure a third party to cover the rest of the project.
The letter, acquired by the Globe through a public records request, was written in September of last year by Boston University President Robert A. Brown and directed to former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78.  According to the Globe, the letter stated that the university was “prepared to help fund the construction of West Station” pending further discussion and an agreement that would prevent cars and buses from using the university’s West Campus to reach the station.
BU spokesperson Colin D. Riley told The Crimson that the state and the university have not finalized the agreement, and need to have further discussions about the impact the project would have on surrounding neighborhoods.
Responding on behalf of the Baker administration, MassDOT spokesperson Michael Verseckes wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that the state “welcome[s] any opportunity to engage in a discussion about transportation public-private partnerships beneficial to our local communities and educational institutions.”
Verseckes also wrote that the administration’s immediate concern is “getting the current commuter rail system running on a regular schedule,” after historic snowfall this winter caused multiple shutdowns of many MassDOT public transit services.
Allston resident Richard Parr ’01 said the letter’s revelation was not particularly surprising.
“If you look at the kind of value that this station could unlock...I think it’s natural that big institutions would want to have their own lines of communication—but it’s ultimately up to the city and state to balance that and the interests of the people,” he said.

Associate Dean and Dean of Students at Harvard Law School Ellen M. Cosgrove, who also serves as one of the school's deputy Title IX coordinators, will leave her post in Cambridge for Yale Law School at the end of this academic year.
After 11 years at the Law School, Cosgrove will become associate dean of Yale Law School, where she will oversee the Offices of Student Affairs and Career Development.
The Title IX personnel change comes as the Law School moves to implement a new set of procedures for responding to cases of alleged sexual harassment, separate from the newly centralized University procedures that govern the process. The school-specific procedures stipulate that the Law School’s Title IX unit, rather than the central Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, oversee Title IX investigations.
According to Law School spokesperson Robb London, the procedures will be implemented soon. As of February, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights was reviewing the school’s new procedures, as part of a resolution agreement signed when the federal government found the Law School in violation of Title IX last year.
Cosgrove wrote in an email that Lakshmi E. Clark-McClendon, the assistant director of student services, and Jeffrey C. McNaught, the director of student affairs, will be the interim leaders of the Law School's Dean of Students office.
“We’re in ongoing discussions about how best to cover distinct responsibilities in my absence,” Cosgrove wrote.
Cosgrove cited the length of her tenure at Harvard as one of her reasons for the change.
“I have been in the same job for eleven years and while I continue to love it, I do feel that I have accomplished many of the things over which I have control,” she wrote.
While Cosgrove wrote that many aspects of her future and current positions will be similar, she added that idiosyncratic institutional differences will affect her role.
“For example, Harvard is more decentralized than Yale or Chicago which means that some of the work I do here (accommodations under the ADA, Title IX, housing) is done locally in my office as opposed to through central structures at other universities,” she wrote.
Martha L. Minow, the dean of Harvard Law School, informed school affililates of Cosgrove’s departure in an email on March 2.
“In her eleven years at HLS, Ellen and her able staff have been instrumental in transforming the student experience and building a sense of community and engagement among students that is unprecedented,” Minow wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. Department of Education is considering revising its controversial draft college rating system to create two systems instead of the one system initially proposed, according to a report by the Chronicle of Higher Education.
The dual rating system would have two parts, tailored to different audiences, that would use different metrics of evaluation, according to the Chronicle. The first, using raw outcome data, would be directed towards a consumer audience, while the second, using data adjusted for individual institutions, would be aimed to help policymakers and researchers measure accountability.
First proposed by President Barack Obama in 2013, the college rating system intends to evaluate institutions of higher education along a number of proposed criteria, such as graduation rates, average net price, student loan debt, and post-college earnings, according to the draft report. The drafted version would classify colleges and universities as high-, middle-, or low-performing based on these and other metrics, but would not rate institutions numerically.
The Department of Education initiative has faced criticism from some education experts. University President Drew G. Faust, for her part, questioned the worth of evaluating job market success before the draft proposal was released.
“I think we need to argue with any notion of college that says it’s simply about putting people in jobs,” Faust said in December, before the draft system was unveiled. “Certainly that’s a significant part of what we intend with the way we educate you.… We also want a sense of creativity and adaptability that will ready people for a job that we don’t even know about yet.”
Faust was not available for comment this weekend on the possible two-part system.
Peter F. Lake '81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, echoed the concerns of Faust and other experts. Even with the possible revisions, Lake said he still sees the rating system as “problematic…[for] tying value to monetary outcomes and graduation rates.”
He argued that the dual system could still unfairly evaluate some institutions, such as universities with first generation students who do not complete college in four years, or others where students take time off after graduation to travel instead of immediately joining the workforce.
“That’s not going to help your score, even though that may not necessarily be a bad thing,” Lake said. “Those students may be reporting they’re getting 100 percent value for their education money, but the government will say your school is not performing as well.”
Still, Lake said Harvard and its peer institutions with high retention, graduation, and employment rates after graduation “will walk away winners” on both scales.

Members of the committee that recommended controversial changes to Harvard’s non-union health benefits plan said it will likely change in the future, though they have yet to determine the nature of such revisions.
Discussions and debate surrounding the health benefits plan, which was first unveiled last September and rolled out this January, have been ongoing. Over the past few weeks, the University Benefits Committee that recommended the changes held three information sessions for faculty and other non-union University employees under the plan, fielding questions from attendees and explaining their rationale for recommending the changes.
Last November, University President Drew G. Faust announced that the UBC would host the information sessions following a semester-long back and forth between faculty members and administrators, which culminated in a vote by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to request a repeal of the health benefits changes.
“It’s very likely there will be changes, but that remains to be determined, because there are changes always happening,” said UBC member Joseph P. Newhouse, a professor of health policy at several Harvard schools. “That was the point of these meetings.”
According to members of the UBC, about 30 to 40 people have attended each of the meetings, which were held in Cambridge and Longwood over the past few weeks. Though members of Harvard’s Faculty have been the most vocal critics of the new plan, Sociology professor Christopher Winship said many staff members attended Friday’s meeting.
For their part, “a group of concerned Harvard exempt staff members” have created an online forum called openharv.org to engage peers in anonymous discussions about the benefits changes.
FAS Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser and three members of the UBC sat on a panel at one of the planned information sessions, held at the Kennedy School of Government on March 20, according to Maeve C. Kelley, assistant to Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann, who was also present.
According to Winship, the meeting on March 20 began with a short presentation on the current health plan. The subsequent panel included an explanation of the rationale for the health benefits plan changes, as well as discussion of individual scenarios and issues that the plan raised among attendees and the future of Harvard’s health benefits plan, according to UBC members.
UBC chair Michael E. Chernew, a professor at Harvard Medical School, said he thinks the meetings have, overall, been “constructive” and feedback from the attendees will help guide further UBC discussions on the health benefits plan.
“We are continuing looking at the benefits plans,” Chernew said. “I do think that always, going forward, we will take into account the feedback of the community in making changes.”
Chernew said the meeting in Longwood on March 16 made clear problems that postdoctoral fellows say they have faced under the new plan.
“They earn substantially less than faculty members in general, and they are concerned that the cost sharing that is imposed on them is particularly burdensome given their income level,” Chernew said, adding that out-of-pocket spending and financial pressures created by childbearing also contributed to anxieties for post-docs. “That’s a legitimate concern.”
Moving forward, according to Chernew, the UBC has three items on its current agenda: to assess the 2015 health benefits plan and look at other possible plans for next year; to improve communications between the UBC and people affected by its recommendations; and to measure the impact of the changes to the 2015 plan. Additionally, Chernew will attend the Faculty Council’s meeting this Wednesday.
“It’s a continual journey to try to get the benefits right at Harvard,” Chernew said.

In response to a report that Yale Law School had decided to destroy its student admissions evaluation files, Edward Blum—the president of nonprofit membership group Students for Fair Admissions, Inc.—sent a letter Thursday to every Ivy League university president, except for Harvard’s, to object to any further deletions of student admission records.
Project on Fair Representation, a legal defense group also led by Blum, is currently suing Harvard for allegedly setting admissions quotas on students of Asian descent and engaging in “racial balancing” in its admissions process. According to Blum, Harvard did not receive a similar letter regarding admissions file destruction because it is already facing litigation and must retain all records during the lawsuit’s discovery period.
In the letter, Blum wrote that the file destruction raised concerns under the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a Department of Education act that holds that the documents must be accessible under federal law. FERPA attracted widespread media attention in January after The New York Times reported that Stanford students had invoked it to successfully access copies of their records from the university, including written assessments and numerical scores assigned to them by admissions officers.
“It should go without saying that Yale cannot destroy evidence essential to judicial review of its admissions policies and expect to withstand strict scrutiny if and when its admissions policies are challenged in court,” the letter read.
Blum also wrote that Yale’s employment of racial consideration in admissions decisions subjects the university to legal scrutiny under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that “this brazen attempt to avoid scrutiny of legally questionable admissions practices is precisely the wrong course of action at precisely the wrong time.”
Harvard has denied all of Blum’s allegations of race-based discrimination in its admissions process and will meet the plaintiffs of the complaint at a status conference in April.

Keynote speakers at the Harvard US-China Economic Forum stressed the importance of building economic relationships abroad, as well as fostering connections among domestic groups, on Saturday in Northwest Labs.
Robert L. Holden, the former governor of Missouri; Keiko M. Orrall, a state representative in the Massachusetts Legislature; and Steve Barclay, the director of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York, gave keynote addresses at the forum.
Barclay said Hong Kong has historically served the role of connecting China with the rest of the world and spoke about its status as a global financial center.
Holden, who is also the chairman of the Midwest U.S.-China Association, spoke about the future of the U.S. economy and discussed challenges the country will face in the future.
He argued that many of the advantages the United States had in the past, such as geographic isolation, are no longer relevant for future economic growth.
“The technology revolution of the last 40 years has changed all of us,” Holden said. “What physical barriers protected our economy in the past are no longer relevant today.”
Holden said the U.S. needs to embrace globalization as a strategy for the future and marked the importance of global bilateral relationships.
“No longer are we a self-contained economy,” said Holden, who also argued that the government should encourage building relationships between academic institutions, like-minded businesses, and governmental institutions.
Speaking about the need for immigration reform and his role in promoting the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, Holden said connections start with young people and “immigration is where we build the foundations for those connections to grow.”
Orrall, who is the first Asian American woman to serve in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, also stressed the need for communication and relationships in the domestic political arena.
She criticized what she described as partisanship in the current political landscape, especially at the federal level, describing what she called the “lack of communication and the unwillingness to build relationships across party lines.”
The event was hosted by the Harvard US-China Economic Interaction Council, a student organization that is affiliated with the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The group organized different panels throughout the day with leaders in finance and entrepreneurship, allowing for attendees to ask them questions live either directly or through an online platform. Attendees also had the opportunity to interact with the panelists and keynote speakers during a networking session held after the conference.

Astronomy professor Alyssa A. Goodman has been named the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations' 2015 Scientist of the Year. The award, part of the Harvard Foundation’s annual Albert Einstein Science Conference: Advancing Minorities and Women in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics, will be presented at the conference luncheon later this week.
Goodman, a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution, has diverse research and teaching interests, ranging from astronomy to data visualization and online platforms for research and education.
Goodman and her research group at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics explore how stars form from dense clouds of interstellar gas. The clouds also help scientists trace out spiral structures in the galaxy in high resolution. Her interest in molecular clouds stems from her undergraduate years at MIT, she said, where she wrote a thesis on the polarization of starlight by magnetic fields in space.
She co-founded the Initiative in Innovative Computing at Harvard and served as its director from 2005 to 2008. The initiative, which has since been discontinued, gave rise to projects involving computer simulation and data integration, according to Goodman.
Goodman also spearheaded the organization of “Seamless Astronomy,” an effort that aims to facilitate scientific research through data sharing.
On campus, Goodman teaches graduate-level courses on the interstellar medium and star formation, a General Education class called Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 19: “The Art of Numbers,” and Freshman Seminar 27j: “Prediction: From Ancient Omens to Modern Computer Simulations.”
Goodman said she is also the host of an effort called PredictionX, a future HarvardX class and project involving “about 25 faculty, tracing the history of how humans have predicted their own future from ancient times to now.”
According to Goodman, the effort will “be the most modular, most unusual, and reusable bit of online material that Harvard has ever produced.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With three minutes left in the second period of the Frozen Four semifinal for women’s hockey between Minnesota and Wisconsin, the spelling bee begins again.
“M…I…N…”
Each letter erupts from maroon-and-gold stands, and the noise vibrates through the Ridder Arena in Minneapolis, reaching the highest rows of the press box.
“N…E…S…”
With each sound, Gophers fans shove their fists in the air. The choreography is impressive: hands move up and down in perfect unison, row after row. The capacity crowd forms a stadium-sized piston.
“S…O…T…A"
And with that final A, fans yell out their home state—“Minnesota, Minnesota!”—before lapsing into a prolonged, “Yeaaaaah Gophers!”
For someone who has never seen a game in Ridder before—indeed, for someone who has never seen a live college hockey game in Minnesota—the chant seems militaristic and unusually involved. The level of excitement is just foreign.
“These are the kind of crowds that our women that play this game deserve to play in front of,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We talk about that a lot. The bigger the crowd, the better it is.”
In this Frozen Four, the traditional chant celebrates a traditional event: the Gophers scoring another goal en route to another national championship berth. Counting this year, Minnesota has made four straight NCAA title games.
The Gophers’ success fits into a larger narrative of the Midwest’s hegemony over women’s hockey. The Frozen Four has existed for women’s hockey since 2001, and in 14 years, only one team not named Minnesota, Minnesota-Duluth, or Wisconsin lifted the trophy. That was Clarkson, a college from near-Canada, N.Y., that toppled the Gophers in 2014.
However, Minnesota-Wisconsin is not the only small area that holds disproportionate power in the world of women’s college hockey. If you are a world-class high school player who doesn’t want to go to college in the Midwest, then you have one alternative: move to Boston.
A quick look at the NCAA’s official RPI standings confirms this regional duality. Heading into the Frozen Four, the top five college teams were, in order: Boston College, Minnesota, Harvard, Wisconsin, and Boston University.
This distinction has rarely been more apparent than at this year’s Frozen Four, which pitted the Crimson and the Eagles on one side of the bracket and the Gophers and the Badgers on the other.
“The big thing is there’s pride in each region,” Stone said. “Minnesota is the state of hockey. Women’s hockey was born in New England. There’s tremendous pride in both regions of the country.
When Harvard meets Minnesota for the national championship, the game will mean more than clash of two highly talented teams. It will also symbolize the clash of two hockey cultures.
One is a world of Minnesota Rouser chants, a culture in which area newspapers grant front-page attention to Frozen Four developments. The other is a place with perhaps as much hockey history but certainly not as much hockey saturation.
The two worlds are different and sometimes distrustful, and on Sunday afternoon, they will collide in a miniaturized version, small enough to fit onto a hockey rink for a 60-minute reckoning.
ICE HOCKEY CENTRAL
It’s a Friday night at Joe Senser’s Restaurant & Sports Theater in Minneapolis, and the room is packed. Structurally, the walls are wood-paneled; in reality, they’re television-paneled.
Three separate March Madness games play on three separate monitors, but these contests don’t attract the full concentration of all customers. The rest of the sports world may be fixated on the closeout of a Villanova-NC State basketball upset, but a majority of monitors displays a different event: Minnesota men’s hockey is playing Michigan.
In case commercials ever interrupt that matchup, other televisions provide an alternative game. This one’s Michigan Tech against Minnesota State.
It’s a generally understood truism that the further north you travel, the more hockey fans you find. And in Minneapolis, the largest city in one of the most northern-situated states in the country, you can’t turn around without bumping into a family wearing hockey jerseys.
The looming presence of the University of Minnesota concentrates this fandom on a single object, namely the Gophers. In a town that loving refers to its local college as “the U,” Minnesota’s hockey teams enjoy high profiles.
“I think it’s the culture of our program [that allows for success],” Minnesota coach Brad Frost said. “If you lived here, you hear a lot about that and our values.”
The Gophers encourage this attitude with lavish spending on facilities. Ridder Arena is one of two hockey rinks on campus. The other, Mariucci Arena, seats 10,000 and exclusively caters to the men’s team.
While Ridder has less than half the capacity of its bigger and older sibling, the arena, advertised as the first facility intended only for women’s hockey use, sports enough high-tech features to make less specialized venues look downright shabby.
There are the box seats that line one side of the arena, overlooking sections of maroon bleachers. There are the 11 locker rooms and complete weight room. There are even smoke machines that accent every team entrance and goal.
The emphasis on luxury has clear returns, as the Gophers draw nearly 2,000 fans per game, which is almost always more than what opponents draw to their home arenas when Minnesota comes to town. Chants and all, the home environment of Ridder Arena is intimidating, and the crowd will reach fever-pitch intensity on Sunday afternoon.
“It makes a difference when the crowd is really into it and pumping the team up,” said Harvard senior forward Hillary Crowe. “We talk about that sixth man. There’s a little bit of envy [as a Crimson player].”
Crowe, a Minnesota native on the Harvard roster, has a unique perspective on this regional divide. Growing up in Eden Prairie, Minn., a city 12 miles outside Minneapolis, she was as infatuated by the Gophers as any other local.
“As a Minnesota hockey player, I grew up always wanting to go to the U,” Crowe said. “Later on in the process, doors opened up out East, and I fell in love with the culture out East.”
She may have fallen for the culture of the East at large, but Crowe ended up in a specific city. Like scores of other talented hockey players, Crowed found herself in college in Boston. Or, more specifically, at a college across the river from Boston.
RISING IN THE NORTHEAST
Renovated this past year, the Bright-Landry Center is impressive in its own right. The arena is light, clean, and open, and a four-sided video screen hangs above center ice, providing video replays throughout the game.
But a hockey arena can only look so impressive when, in the 2014-15 season, the home team fills an average of 793 seats out of 2,800 available ones. A video screen can only give so much information when many of the fans that do come can’t tell an offside call from an icing call.
Maybe this is the best way to put it: there is no Harvard women’s ice hockey equivalent to the Minnesota Rouser.
The comparative lack of spirit in Bright-Landry is not a result of inferior on-ice talent. The Crimson has consistently ranked among the best teams in the nation over the past few years, posting upwards of 20 wins in each of the last four campaigns.
But the lack of popular support is so apparent that earlier the season, a Harvard student and Crimson sports editor wrote a column lamenting the lack of student dedication for the Harvard men’s ice hockey program. Mind you, this is a team that once stood at No. 1 in the national standings.
The imbalance between quality of venue and student popularity is not limited to the Crimson. Since 1910, Boston has housed Matthews Arena, the oldest hockey stadium in perpetual use. Northeastern teams still use the stadium, but an average of 302 people—less than a sixth of the Gophers’ average totals—come to see games.
It’s difficult to pin down the origin of this hockey apathy without a general invocation of culture. This sort of logic argues that the Midwest prioritizes hockey because it always has. That’s that, end of story.
A more concrete explanation has to do with the way that hockey players develop in Minnesota instead of Massachusetts. The majority of players on the Gophers’ roster arrive on campus after playing at a public high school.
Cultural attitudes can be subjective and difficult to pin down, but the level of public school hockey talent is not. By providing free access to high-quality competition, Midwest high schools open up hockey to an entire population.
In order to find an equivalent level of competition, Massachusetts-area high school players have to migrate to prep school leagues, which comes with obvious costs.
However, this limitation has not obviously hindered the Harvard program, which won its fifth ECAC tournament championship since 2000 and returned for its ninth appearance in the Frozen Four, capped by a third championship appearance.
“Certainly here in Minnesota, they’ve had great success,” Stone said. “Teams out east have had great success. You don’t get caught up in ‘Who’s better.’ Let’s have an incredible event…to showcase the game of women’s hockey.”
Frost strikes the same tone. Although hockey might have different cultural weights in the Midwest and the Northeast, the Gophers coach hopes to train focus on the game that will happen inside Ridder on Sunday.
“As I look at Harvard, I see a lot of us in them and vice versa,” Frost said. “[I’m] looking forward to playing a team from the East and having that opportunity to have a great game of sixty minutes or more."

The No. 17/15 Harvard men’s hockey team was placed in the Midwest Region seed in the NCAA Men’s Hockey Tournament and will take on No. 10/10 Nebraska-Omaha in the first round of the tournament on Saturday. The Crimson will take the ice in South Bend in a sudden-death matchup against the Mavericks.
Harvard (21-12-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) enters the tournament hot, having gone 6-1 in the ECAC Tournament that spanned the last three weekends. Junior Jimmy Vesey set a tournament record with nine goals in the team’s seven games en route to being named the tourney’s Most Outstanding Player. The Crimson outscored its opponents 25-15 in its run for the team’s first conference championship since 2006.
Nebraska-Omaha (18-12-6, 12-8-4 NCHC) was swept in the first round of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference tournament by No. 18/- St. Cloud State, who would go on to upset No. 1/1 North Dakota in the semifinals before losing to No. 6/5 Miami in the finals.
Minnesota State Mankato, the number one overall seed in the tournament, is also in the Midwest Region. They will take on the Rochester Institute of Technology in the first-round, with the victory taking on the winner of the Harvard-Omaha matchup on Sunday.
Two teams from the ECAC earned at-large bids. Regular season champion Quinnipiac and Yale made it into the tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s March in Minneapolis, and for fans of the Minnesota women’s ice hockey team, this month has a single meaning: championship time.
For the fourth consecutive year, the Gophers (33-3-4, 22-2-4 WCHA) will suit up for a national title matchup. This season’s edition features Harvard (27-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC), which is a rerun of championship bouts in 2004 and 2005.
Minnesota won both those contests, giving the team two of its five overall national titles.
The Gophers’ dominance extends outside of matchups against the Crimson. In each of the past three years, Minnesota has taken a share of the WCHA crown, quite possibly the toughest divisional prize in college hockey.
Over the past several years, the Gophers have been the masters of the Midwest, the New York Yankees of women’s hockey. And with the team’s top four point-getters slated to return next year, the tradition of success shows no signs of ending.
“To make it to the national championship four years in a row, it’s remarkable,” Minnesota coach Brad Frost said. “I know our team is very excited, especially to be able to advance and do that at home.”
Just how good are these Gophers?
Ask recent history, and the answer will come back without hesitation: practically unbeatable.
Between Feb. 17, 2012 and Nov. 17, 2013, Minnesota played 62 games without a loss, an NCAA record. Only six contests were decided by a margin of one goal.
This stretch included the 2012-13 campaign, which inarguably stands as the most impressive year of women’s hockey ever played. The Gophers earned an overall 41-0-0 mark and ended the season with a championship photo-shoot in Ridder Arena in late March.
Even when North Dakota broke the perfect streak with a 3-2 win the next year, Minnesota needed little time to recover. The Gophers ripped off a 19-0-1 run to close out the regular season and returned to the title match a month later.
“These kids are never about themselves,” Frost said. “When you get a bunch of great people on a team, then the organization creates a culture that’s pretty darn special.”
This year’s squad, which boasted a 19-game unbeaten streak at one point, is a beneficiary of this culture. It’s not just that Minnesota wins, but that the wins are so lopsided: the Gophers have outscored opponents 180-47, including a 42-12 advantage in power-play scores.
As much as Minnesota has distinguished itself as a unit, the Gophers are just as impressive as a collection of individuals.
“We recruit…incredible kids, first and foremost,” Frost said. “We can recruit great kids from great families who happen to be really good hockey players, and that’s the order of how we do things.”
Since 2002, 12 Minnesota players have earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic team. This list includes forwards Krissy Wendell and Natalie Darwitz, who served as captains of the 2006 and 2010 American squads, respectively.
In three straight seasons stretching from 2003 to 2005, Wendell and Darwitz were named finalists for the Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award, which recognizes the best player in women’s hockey each year. The Gophers also earned two titles over Harvard during this stretch.
Wendell and Darwitz are not unique for the national attention that they received. Since 2008, at least one Minnesota player has claimed a spot on the 10-person shortlist for the award. In the 2012-13 season, all of the top three finalists played for the Gophers.
According to players and coaches, Minnesota incubates not just talent but also life values. This season, the Gophers had to memorize a team wide quote, and at media day, junior forward Hannah Brandt could rattle it off from memory: “No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who are trained by it.”
“It’s definitely not just something [Frost] says to [the media],” Brandt says. “We hear it every day, probably plenty, and it’s definitely something we all try to live out.”
Attention to detail has led to incredible results, as Brandt tops the team this year with 73 points.  She has earned a top-three nomination for the Patty Kazmaier Award for her efforts. Talent is well distributed, however, as six Minnesota skaters have racked up at least 14 goals.
Heck, even the team’s mascot can skate. In between periods, a goofy costumed gopher whips around the rink, somehow swerving, stopping, and staying upright while wearing a large and furry head.
But the scariest part of the 2014-15 Gophers may have to do with a moment of weakness, not strength. Last season, Minnesota entered the NCAA championship with 18 straight victories, but the Gophers dropped the game, 5-4, despite erasing a 3-1 deficit at one point.
There’s a thought to ponder: as dominant as Minnesota has been in recent seasons, the team will skate into today’s final with the intensity of a slighted victim.
“Last year was hard that we didn’t win,” junior goalie Amanda Leveille said. “Coach always tells us that we can’t base the season on one game…. We’re going to focus on Sunday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 22, 2015, 9:45 p.m.
MINNEAPOLIS—For the third time in 11 years, the Minnesota women's ice hockey team denied Harvard the NCAA title, defeating the Crimson, 4-1. The championship game loss came after Harvard (27-6-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) made its first NCAA Frozen Four appearance since 2005.
Before Minnesota (34-3-4, 22-2-4 WCHA) junior forward Hannah Brandt was a two-time NCAA champion, she was a late cut from the 2014 National Team and a runner-up for the 2015 Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award, the highest honor in collegiate women’s ice hockey.
A few minutes into the 2015 Frozen Four title game against Harvard, Brandt was the victim of another blindsiding hit, this one from Harvard sophomore forward Sydney Daniels.
Enough must have been enough. Almost nine minutes into the final period, Brandt enacted her revenge by collecting a cross outside the crease and lifting the puck past Crimson junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer to give the Gophers a 2-0 advantage.
“Good players make plays,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She’s always had a lot of poise, great hands, and an eye for the net.”
Despite a later goal from Harvard senior forward Sarah Edney, the lead proved insurmountable. Bolstered by a pair of insurance scores, Minnesota emerged from the Ridder Arena with a 4-1 victory over the Crimson and, for the sixth time in program history, a national title.
Meanwhile, Harvard (27-6-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) left a championship matchup empty-handed for the fourth time in the Frozen Four era. Three of these defeats have come at the hands of the Gophers.
“We had to play our most complete game of the year tonight to beat Harvard,” Minnesota coach Brad Frost said. “Had we lost tonight, I still would’ve been very proud of these kids because it was a great year regardless of the outcome.”
On an afternoon in which the two teams combined for one goal in the first 40 minutes, the third period proved to be a decisive explosion of offense.
Halfway through the frame, Brandt’s finish launched the sellout home crowd into euphoria, but the delirium only lasted about six minutes. With 4:54 remaining, Edney swung the momentum back towards the Crimson by firing a tight-angle shot from the left wing past Minnesota netminder Amanda Leveille.
“Getting that goal was huge for us,” senior forward Kalley Armstrong said. “We were just hoping to get a couple of bounces going our way…[and] go out there as hard as we could.”
But the Gophers put together a response of their own just two minutes later.
After gaining possession off a turnover in Harvard’s defensive zone, Minnesota forward Kelly Pannek spotted unmarked teammate Meghan Lorence sprinting down the middle of the ice. The subsequent pass hit Pannek in stride, and the forward slammed the puck home to reestablish a two-goal cushion.
The suddenness of the finish echoed the first score, which came in the final minute of the opening period. Gopher forward-turned-defenseman Megan Wolfe had notched only two goals all season coming into the game, but she showed no hesitation in burying a back-post finish from the faceoff circle.
Wolfe’s score followed a first period defined more by punishing defense than flashy offense. The teams combined for five penalties over the first 20 minutes, including three checking calls against the Crimson.
In the dying moments of the match, Harvard faced a final Minnesota power play after the referees whistled senior forward Lyndsey Fry for an aggressive hit. By that point, little drama remained: an empty-net goal by Gophers forward Rachel Bona had ballooned the score to 4-1 and squashed any hopes of a Crimson comeback.
Yet a turnaround victory had seemed within reach in the second period, when the Crimson strung together long possessions in the Minnesota defensive zone. However, Leveille was a stone wall in the frame, preserving the 1-0 lead.
From there it was up to Brandt to tally the score that ended 1-0 stasis and, in the process, ended the Crimson’s yearlong goal of a national title.
“As I mentioned to our kids in the locker room, they all deserved a better fate today,” Stone said. “We had an absolutely fantastic season…. It’s a special group of kids, and every one of them has done as expected.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two extra-inning games bookended the the Harvard women’s softball team’s final set of spring break games in California. Although the Crimson (7-12) split the extra-inning duels, the team earned a 3-2 record over the three-day stretch, winning the opener and sweeping its two contests on the second day.
SAN DIEGO 1, HARVARD 0
After retiring three consecutive Toreros hitters in the bottom of the seventh, senior Laura Ricciardone hoped for some offensive support in extra innings to win her second complete, extra-inning game in three days. But the Crimson’s bats went silent and two defensive errors behind Ricciardone in the bottom of the tenth gave San Diego (21-14) the win.
“We need a few other people to match [Laura’s] competitiveness on the field and we will score some runs before seven innings,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “She gave her heart on that field and we need a couple people to step up offensively and we’ll win some more games.”
Toreros freshman Paige von Sprecken held the Crimson to just two hits over ten innings. When Harvard threatened with a runner just 60 feet from home and no outs in the top of the tenth, von Sprecken sent the next three batters down in order to set San Diego up for the win.
HARVARD 7, FAIRLEIGH DICKINSON 3
The Crimson broke a one-all tie in the third inning and piled on runs in the fourth and fifth to take a decisive 7-3 win over the Knights (3-5). Harvard had 15 hits in the game, with senior shortstop Emily Gusse and freshman left fielder Maddy Kaplan each going 3-for-4.
Sophomore Taylor Cabe pitched three shutout innings in relief to preserve the Crimson’s lead.
“A lot of things started to come together,” Gusse said. “We started to put our our defense and our hitting and our pitching all together at once and got a lot better results.”
HARVARD 7, BETHUNE-COOKMAN 4
A three-run home run off the bat of Gusse gave the Crimson an early 3-0 lead in the top of the second inning. But Harvard saw that lead disappear when the Wildcats (6-22) scored four runs off of Cabe in the bottom half of the inning.
Trailing 4-3 in the fourth inning, the Crimson responded with four runs of their own to retake the lead. Sophomore second baseman Giana Panariello capped off the inning with a base-clearing double.
After Cabe gave up six hits and four runs in the first two innings, sophomore Morgan Groom came on in relief and held Bethune-Cookman to no runs over five innings of work.
FAIRLEIGH DICKINSON 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson couldn’t generate any offense against Fairleigh Dickinson senior Megan Reiner, who surrendered just three hits in seven innings of work.
Groom and Cabe combined for six shutout innings, but Fairleigh Dickinson’s three-run fifth proved enough to give Reiner and the Knights the win.
“This trip kind of taught us that we have to figure out how to put things together to push just one or two runs across when things aren’t working as well offensively,” Gusse said. “In order for us to be successful in Ivies, we are going to have to figure out how to strategically just be able to manufacture just a few runs.”
HARVARD 2, BETHUNE-COOKMAN 1
With the score locked at one in the eighth inning, Coach Allard put in freshman Melissa Lacro to pinch run. Lacro advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on an error by the Wildcats shortstop to give the Crimson its first extra-inning win of the season.
Harvard also took advantage of small ball to score its first run in the fourth inning. After hitting a single through the right side, senior left fielder Andrea Del Conte stole second to get into scoring position and scored on a single by senior first baseman Adrienne Hume.
Ricciardone came out on top in the pitcher’s duel giving up just five hits and one run in eight innings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its ­second Ivy League game of the season, Harvard (3-3, 1-1 Ivy) fell to No. 13 Princet­on (6-1, 2-0), 17-12, on Saturday afternoon in Princeton, NJ. Despite an even score at halftime, 6-6, the Tigers managed to outscore the Crimson by a margin of five in the second half.
Although the teams were neck-and-neck during the opening frame, Princeton doubled Harvard in shots (18-9) and groundballs (10-4) in the second period. The Tigers also edged out the Crimson in draw controls after halftime, 10-8.
“In the second half, we really couldn’t get a draw,” said junior co-captain and defender Tory Waldstein. “So they had the ball for most of the half, which made it really hard for us to gather ourselves. They went on a run, and we just weren’t able to respond.”
The Harvard offense tallied six goals per half. Freshman midfielder Julia Glynn led the Crimson with five goals, four of which were unassisted. Glynn registered the first goal for Harvard in each period and also forced a Tigers turnover. Sophomore attack Marisa Romeo had four goals of her own and chipped in two ground balls and one caused turnover for the Crimson.
Only four of Harvard’s 12 goals were assisted. Sophomore attack Megan Hennessey tallied a game-high three assists, while Romeo notched the fourth.
“Offensively, we had some impressive individual efforts,” said junior co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd. “But, on the whole, we struggled to finish our shots and we didn’t consistently play as a cohesive unit. At the end of the day, that cost us the game.”
Princeton benefited from a second period scoring surge, notably a five-goal streak beginning in the 38th minute of the contest. The Tigers capitalized on two man-up opportunities and even found the back of the net during a man-down situation. Sophomore midfielder Olivia Hompe led Princeton with five goals, four of which came from assists.
“This was a game we definitely would like to take back,” Waldstein said. “Defensively we just were not playing together, which is actually usually our strength … I think a lot of things didn’t go our way, and we got frustrated, which is one of the struggles of a young team.”
The Crimson executed nine of 11 clears and had nine turnovers. The three Harvard goalies together tallied only five saves, led by freshman goalie Meredith Brown with three.
“Obviously, everyone is really disappointed with the loss,” Todd said. “We all know that we are just as good a team as Princeton, and we simply didn’t play our best lacrosse on Saturday. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to play them again in the Ivy tournament.”
All 16 of the Crimson’s points were contributed by underclassmen.
“Our team has a lot of strengths,” Waldstein said. “We have a lot of quickness and great team chemistry. Obviously we rely heavily on sophomores and freshmen, so we need to work on building leadership and poise that comes from experience. I think that weakness definitely showed against Princeton. Hopefully we will get another shot at them in the Ivy tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The final whistle sounded at the end of regulation, but the score remained knotted at 11. The No. 15/16 Harvard men’s lacrosse team entered overtime with Dartmouth after an intense game of back and forth between the Ivy League rivals. Despite five combined shots by the Crimson and Big Green in the extra period, neither team could break the deadlock. Another overtime was needed, but the stalemate wouldn’t last much longer—99 seconds into the second overtime period, Dartmouth freshman midfielder Jack Korzelius netted the game winner to help the Big Green clinch a 12-11 upset on its home turf.
The result was disappointing for Harvard (4-4, 0-2 Ivy), who finished its spring break slate winless after back-to-back defeats against Brown and North Carolina heading into the game. On the other hand, Dartmouth (2-3, 1-0) was fresh off a two-week break without any games. The effect was evident throughout, with the Big Green dominating at the X, securing 22 of the 27 faceoffs and claiming a 39-34 advantage in groundballs while converting three of four man-up opportunities and holding Harvard’s man advantage scoreless on all six of its chances.
“We were severely out-played in the faceoffs…and our man-ups,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “I think that wasn’t the only reason, but the combination of those two areas of the game [was] the biggest difference maker.”
The contest began with a rocky start for the Crimson, as Dartmouth opened the scoring less than two minutes into the game with three goals in 36 seconds.
“I think we just came out flat,” said coach Wojcik. “We were down three-nothing really quickly, and in Ivy League games you can’t come out that way.”
After a back and forth second quarter, the Crimson trailed 3-5 at halftime, but Harvard fought back, with junior midfielder Ian Ardrey and junior attackman Devin Dwyer opening the third quarter with back-to-back goals to even the score at 5-5. However, Dartmouth responded with a run of its own, tallying three straight goals to seize an 8-5 lead. After a goal by freshman midfielder Sean Coleman halted the Big Green run, the fourth quarter began with Dartmouth holding on to a two-goal lead.
The teams traded goals for most of the fourth quarter, and the Big Green maintained an 11-9 lead heading into the final minutes of the game. With just under three minutes to play, junior midfielder Ian Ardrey took the game into his own hands, scoring unassisted to pull the Crimson within one.
Despite winning the ensuing face-off, Dartmouth failed to maintain possession and run out of the clock, turning the ball over twice to give Harvard possession with under a minute remaining. After a timeout by the Crimson, Ardrey came to the rescue, all but ensuring overtime by netting his fourth goal of the game with only 14 seconds of play left. The junior matched his career-high with four goals on the day while also achieving a career-best with five points. However, Ardrey’s heroics were not enough to save the Crimson from its inability to win faceoffs and convert on man-up chances.
Junior goalkeeper Bryan Moore made 14 saves, giving him double-digit saves in each of his last three starts. Harvard has struggled to protect its netminders this season, as injuries to standout junior defensemen Stephen Jahelka and Bobby Duvnjak have forced Wojcik and his staff to field a makeshift unit with a number of players playing out of position at close defense.
Although this loss stings for the Crimson, it has four games left in conference play and still has the opportunity to put itself in position for a postseason run.
“The season is still very long and under our control. There are lots of little things we learned today as individuals,” Moore said. “I don’t think anyone is freaking out at this point. The rest of the season is a test to see how well we can improve in practice; the wins will take care of themselves. If we work to continue to build trust and cohesion across the field, we will have success.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore fencer Adrienne Jarocki advanced quickly down the strip with her feet, cocking her saber back as she prepared to lunge at Notre Dame freshman Francesca Russo. But before the she could compete her motion, Russo attacked Jarocki in preparation. After scoring the touch, Russo raised her arms in celebration as Jarocki pulled her mask off and walked off the strip in disappointment.
The final touch by Russo, which clinched an 15-12 elimination round victory, ensured that there would be no repeat NCAA individual championship for the Crimson sophomore. Despite finishing the grueling 23-bout pool play round with 20 wins to earn the top seed, Jarocki would have to wait another year for another shot at an NCAA championship.
“I’m not too happy with this result,” Jarocki said. “Next year I’m going to be a little bit more hungry to repeat what I did freshman year.”
Earlier on the weekend on the men’s side, Harvard freshman Eli Dershwitz also saw his bid for an individual saber title end in the semifinals. After being on the receiving end of what Crimson coach Peter Brand described as “not good” refereeing, Dershwitz fell behind early against fourth-seeded Ferenc Valkai of St. John’s and eventually lost the bout, 15-10.
“I think there were a few things that I didn’t agree with, and instead of just focusing and channeling my disagreement, I really let my emotions get the best of me,” Dershwitz said. “For the last few touches of the bout, I wasn’t entirely there mentally, and I made a few mistakes.”
Besides the two semifinal finishers, Harvard sent eight other Crimson fencers to the NCAA individual championships.
“Considering that we had 10 [fencers] altogether, and we finished up seventh...it’s pretty good, [also] considering that we had 11 last year and finished up sixth,” Brand said.
WOMEN’S FENCING
Throughout her semifinal bout with Russo, Jarocki had a tough time finishing her attacks.
“The operative word here is that she was tentative, she was a little concerned with her opponent’s counter actions, and as a result, her actions came up short and weak,” Brand said. “She kept fearing the contact and as a result, her attacks were ineffective.”
A nearly simultaneous action that set both green and red lights off was awarded to Russo to give the Notre Dame fencer the 8-5 lead as the first three-minute period came to a close. Jarocki and Brand talked things over in a timeout, and coming out of the break, the Harvard sophomore scored the next touch after getting pushed down her side of the strip.
However, Jarocki was not able to overtake her opponent, and after she drew within one, Russo scored the final two touches of the bout for the 15-12 victory.
“[Russo] was just fencing very well, and I was making the wrong decisions at times,” Jarocki said. “I was a little hesitant to attack because she kept getting me in preparation, and so I was scared to accelerate.”
In the opening round of the championships, Jarocki laid claim to the first seed with a 20-3 record and a plus-51 indicator.
“Overall, Adrienne had two great days, and she had the most wins out of everybody,” Brand said. “She should have won—that was the expectation—but again, the pressure was quite intense to repeat.”
Outside of Jarocki, no other Crimson women qualified for the final four of an individual weapon—but senior epéeist Emma Vaggo came close. Sporting a plus-11 indicator and a 14-9 record in pool play, Vaggo was just one win away from earning the fourth and final spot in the next round. Additionally, Vaggo beat eventual championship winner Isis Washington in the five-touch bout first round.
“I’m also very happy for senior Emily Vaggo, who had her highest finish ever coming in sixth, and very close to making the final four,” Brand said.
Notably missing from the final four in the women’s saber competition was Crimson junior Aliya Itzkowitz, who lost to Jarocki in the 2014 final. Despite a positive indicator, Itzkowitz’s 12-11 record in pool play left her out of the final elimination bouts. She finished in 11th place.
On the foil side, two Harvard women fenced in their first NCAA championships. Sophomore Hali Nelson was the Crimson’s highest finisher in the event at 16th, while freshman MacKenzie Lawrence ended her weekend 20th.
MEN’S FENCING
After taking seventh with a 16-7 record at the NCAA Northeast Regional to qualify for the championships, Dershwitz wasted little time in establishing himself as one of the top college saber fencers by earning 22 victories in the pool play round, which was tops for all weapons, both men’s and women’s.
“I started off my first day 7-0, which really set the tone for the second day,” Dershwitz said. “I came into the finals with a good mindset and thinking that I could definitely [win] it because the guy I fenced I [had beaten] earlier.”
However, Dershwitz ran into trouble against the fourth-seeded Valkai, and fell by a 15-11 score.
“I think Eli is a very mature person...I saw him lose his cool, and to some extent it was justified—the refereeing was not good,” Brand said. “He got some bad breaks there, and I think the problem [was] that it got to him…. He started rushing and that was the end.”
Despite the loss, Dershwitz will have many more opportunities to prove himself, both in college and outside of Harvard.
“He’s going to have a great career and moving forward, he’s going to try out for the Olympic team,” Brand said. “I think he has a really good chance of making [the US team].”
Four other Crimson men also competed in the event, with the foil pair of junior Jerry Chang and co-captain Brian Kaneshige finishing in sixth and 10th, respectively. Chang came close to qualifying for the final round, needing just one more win and a slightly better indicator to have made the cut.
Also fencing in the same pool as Dershwitz, junior co-captain Duncan O’Brien finished his season with a 19th place finish. Rounding out the group of five Crimson men in competition, junior Nicolas Simko had nine pool bout wins but a minus-20 indicator.
“[It] is just an extremely long tournament and extremely intense,” Simko said. “Overall it’s going to be great, great knowledge for me next year to come back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team spent its spring break on the West Coast, playing in a three-day exhibition singles tournament with Indiana in Las Vegas before taking on Long Beach State in Long Beach, Calif. on Saturday.
The No. 40 Crimson (6-5) fell to the No. 31 49ers (10-3, 4-1 Big West), 4-3, for its first loss since a defeat at Maryland exactly a month prior. The match marked the first game action for sophomore June Lee in nearly two months.
“We had June Lee back in our lineup, which was great,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “June is the hardest worker on the team and she’s also our engine on the court. It’s always great to have her out there and leading the way for us.”
After Long Beach State took the doubles point, victory was hanging in the balance when freshman Ellen Jang-Milsten took on 49ers sophomore Julie Gerard in the sixth match of the tie. Although Jang-Milsten had clinched a match for the Crimson earlier in the season, Gerard proved to be too much for the first-year player.
In a back and forth fourth singles match, Gerard took the first set, 6-4. Jang-Milsten responded with a 6-4 victory of her own in the second set. In the pivotal set, Gerard was able to break Jang-Milsten’s serve to claim a 6-3 victory and give Long Beach State the win.
The 49ers were able to take two of their three matches with Ivy League teams this week. Long Beach State fell to Princeton, 6-1, on Wednesday before besting Dartmouth, 5-2, on Thursday.
Harvard was once again able to pick up victories from its top two singles players. Freshman Nikki Kallenberg, playing from the first singles spot, defeated 49ers sophomore Maeva Razakasoa.
Sophomore Monica Lin picked up a straight set victory over junior Ebba Unden. The duo has not lost since the team’s trip to Northern California in February. Kallenberg improved to 17-4 in her first season while Lin’s victory upped her record to 13-9.
“We really look to build off momentum from [this] match,” Green said. “Monica Lin really just showed a lot of poise and character out there and we’re looking for more great things from her.”
Junior Amy He won her match to give the Crimson three victories on the day. The Burlington, Ont. native ousted freshman Alex Jones in straight sets to take the sixth line match. The win was He’s second consecutive straight set victory.
Lee, playing in her first match since January after sustaining an injury, fell in straight sets to sophomore Hayley Thompson. Despite the loss, it was a step in the right direction for Lee, Harvard’s top singles player for the first four matches of the spring season.
“I was really excited to be playing again,” Lee said. “It’s cool being off the court because you actually get to see things you wouldn’t notice while you’re playing. But I’m glad I’m back and playing again.”
Freshman Annika Ringblom also fell in straight sets in the third collegiate match she has played in her home state, with Long Beach senior Karolina Rozenberg spoiling the homecoming for the freshman from Palos Verdes Estates.
In doubles action, Long Beach State was able to pick up the point after taking the first two matches. Unden and Thompson defeated Lin and Lee, 8-4, while Rozenberg and sophomore Laura Eales beat the freshman duo of Kallenberg and Ringblom, 8-6.
The Crimson fell to 0-3 on the season against teams from California and has not beaten a team from the Golden State since a 2011 victory against San Francisco.
“Playing nonconference matches is really nice,” Lee said. “It gives us the confidence for Ivies. It’s nice mixing the two because we know that Ivies is going to be really close because a lot of the Ivies are doing pretty well [in nonconference matches].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team concluded its spring break trip by taking three out of four from the Army Knights. The Crimson (10-8) defeated the Black Knights (10-8) on Thursday at the New York Yankees Spring Training Complex in Tampa and took both games of Saturday’s doubleheader in Clearwater before falling 6-5 in the series finale.
The team went 5-5 in a brutal Florida stretch of 10 games in nine days but took five of the final six. This was the team’s final stretch before the Ancient Eight regular season begins Saturday.
“We have to stay motivated each day,” said senior second baseman Jake McGuiggan. “The desire to win was very high and heading back up north with a 10-8 record, we’ll definitely take that in good spirits and look forward to this coming weekend.”
ARMY 6, HARVARD 5
Harvard was unable to complete a four-game sweep of Army, falling Saturday afternoon in the series finale. Senior closer and typical Sunday starter Tanner Anderson gave up six earned runs in seven and a third innings of work.
The Crimson took a 4-1 lead after a three-run sixth inning, but Army rallied back with three runs in the seventh and two in the eighth to go up 6-4. In the top of the ninth, freshman Conor Quinn reached on an error and was driven in by junior DJ Link.
Seniors Steve Dill and Mike Martin both flied out to strand pinch runner Matt Sanders at second to give Army the win. Martin and Link led the Harvard offense, combining for three hits and three RBIs.
HARVARD 8, ARMY 3
Matt Timoney threw six innings of two-run ball in Friday’s second game to lead the Crimson to a doubleheader sweep of the Black Knights. The senior righty surrendered just two runs and struck out four to pick up his team-leading third victory of the season.
With Harvard trailing 2-1 entering the bottom half of the sixth, the offense responded with a four-run sixth and a three-run eighth. The Crimson’s offensive attack was balanced in the penultimate game of the series, receiving nine hits from seven players.
The bottom third of the batting order, consisting of junior designated hitter DJ Link, Quinn, and sophomore first baseman Matt Hink, drove in four runs. Captain Ethan Ferreira and freshman leftfielder Matt Rothenberg each had two-hit days for Harvard.
“Coach definitely tries to put together a lineup that one through nine is a threat to get on base,” McGuiggan said. “Over the last six games, everyone collectively did pretty well and that’s a testament to how hard guys have been working.”
Sophomore Greg Coman and junior T.J. Laurisch teamed up to record the final nine outs for the Crimson.
HARVARD 8, ARMY 5
After falling behind 2-0 in the first inning, starter Nick Gruener and Harvard roared back to take Friday’s first game.
After tying the contest in the top of the fifth, the Crimson’s offense tore the game open with a six-run seventh. Army committed three errors, Harvard scattered five hits, and McGuiggan hit his second home run of the season to put the Crimson up for good in the big inning.
Between the second and sixth innings, Gruener threw five scoreless frames. The sophomore’s only trouble of the day came in his first and last innings. The Miami native was touched up for three runs in the seventh and was replaced by junior Sean O’Neill, who recorded the last three outs of the game.
“In all four of the games, [the starting pitchers] were able to go deep and that really helps keep the staff intact,” sophomore reliever Kevin Rex said. “We’re able to have fresh arms even in the tenth game of a week. Our pitching staff has matured a lot from last season and we know how to manage our arms better.”
HARVARD 11, ARMY 8
Propelled by a four-run fourth inning and big offensive days from seniors Ferreira and McGuiggan, Harvard took the first game of the series with the Black Knights on Thursday afternoon in Tampa.
Ferreira drove in four runs and hit his second home run and fifth double of the season while McGuiggan scored three runs and chipped in three hits.
“I think our offense, and at times our defense, was really solid and that was awesome to see,” Rex said. “I think that’s a great sign going into Ivy League play.”
Junior Sean Poppen got the start for the Crimson and gave up six earned runs in six and a third innings. The righty struck out six before turning it over to freshman Ian Miller, who picked up his first collegiate win. Fellow first-year Dylan Combs recorded the final two outs in the ninth to salvage the victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams opened their outdoor schedules this past weekend just like they have every year since 1988–at the Texas Southern Relays in Houston. Despite the event being cut short due to inclement weather, the Crimson managed to obtain positive results in its first taste of outdoor competition.
Junior Autumne Franklin won first place in the 400 meter hurdles, crossing the finish line with a time of 58.71, while sophomore Jackie Modesett finished fifth at the 1:00.08 mark.
Franklin was joined atop the podium by teammate Hannah Mayer, as the senior notched a victory for Harvard in the javelin event with her winning throw of 47.87 meters. The mark was over six meters further than her closest competitor, with teammate junior Megan McHugh behind her in fourth place.
Senior Danielle Barbian, fresh off her Ivy League title in the 200 meter dash, claimed a second place finish in the event with a time of 24.84.
In the longer events of the day, the Crimson women’s 1,600 meter sprint medley lost to its hosts by one one-hundredth of a second. Despite Texas Southern claiming victory, the contingent of co-captain Ashley Collinsworth, Franklin, and juniors Christi Scott and Paige Kouba clocked in at 3:55.90–the second-fastest time in Harvard history.
On the men’s side, the sprint relay came in fourth. The relatively young team made up of rookies Malcolm Johnson, Ahmed Obed, and Matthew Hurst as well as senior Connor Reck completed the event with a time of 3:26.42.
Men’s co-captain Jarvis Harris, meanwhile, clocked in with a time of 54.25 in the 400 meter hurdles, good for fourth place overall.
Harvard was also represented well off the track, producing top-five finishes in multiple events. In the men’s javelin, sophomore Richard Bradley and freshman Andrew Connolly claimed third and fifth, respectively. Sophomore Andrew Roney placed second place in the pole vault after clearing a height of 4.75 meters.
The Crimson continued its solid field performance in the high jump and hammer throw. Sophomore Raegan Nizdil took second in the high jump with a 1.72 meter leap, while senior Ann Giebelhaus was part of a five-way draw for third place.
The Harvard weight throwers chimed in with a pair of fourth-place finishes, as senior Taylor DuPont threw a distance of 50.45 meters on the women’s side, while sophomore Joshua Whitener recorded a mark of 54.84 meters in the men’s competition.
The team continues its outdoor season this weekend, with the athletes splitting into two different contingents. Some members will partake in the Texas Relays hosted by UT Austin, while others will compete in the confines of Massachusetts at the Tufts Snowflake Classic.

Happy Monday, Harvard, and welcome back from spring break! Most of the snow is melted, and somehow Cambridge didn’t flood, so this may actually signal the beginning of spring-ish weather. At least, hopefully it does, because we’ve dealt with more than our fair share of winter weather already this semester (snowiest Boston winter on record, anyone?).
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
It’s going to be sunny all day (yay!) but the temperature still isn’t going to get above freezing, and the winds are going to be decently strong all day. Maybe we just have to take what we can get in terms of the weather.

Chicken Fingers
Philly Cheese Steak Sub
Multigrain Rotini Primavera with Kidney Beans

1) Signing Off: Harvard Senior Prepares To Call Final Game — “Stumbling downstairs, she found her brother, Ben T. Zauzmer '15, in front of his computer—the blinking lights of Madden capturing his complete attention. It wasn’t your typical eight-year-old at the controls, however. Ben was indifferent about winning, focused on the game itself. Volume turned off, he’d taken the role of his hero—play-by-play man Merrill Reese—calling the game for both sides.”
