After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On “Jaded,” typically conflict-shy electronic duo Disclosure mocks an unnamed, aging rival. Over a slinking, shimmering techno beat, group member Howard Lawrence coos, “Golden years left you behind / You cannot replace them / Face it or you’ll waste them.” [Fortunately for Disclosure, they are the perfect candidates to chide the uncreative older EDM generation; it seems the British band’s musical zenith has only just begun. With “Jaded,” the second single from its highly anticipated sophomore album, “Caracal,” Disclosure has concocted yet another current, irresistibly catchy pop tune.
Disclosure, composed of Lawrence and his older brother Guy, first stormed the UK music charts with singles from their critically acclaimed 2013 debut album, “Settle.” While the duo typically turns to high-profile guest artists—Lorde, Eliza Doolittle, AlunaGeorge—to provide lead vocals, for “Jaded,” it decided member Howard would be the best fit. The risk pays off: His lilting falsetto, clouded in hazy distortion, sounds eerily similar to––and actually more pleasantly understated––than that of current R&B superstar Sam Smith. An array of 808-drum claps coalesces with a pulsing, playful synthesizer, creating a track that’s at once slick, breezy, and addictive.
Near the song’s conclusion, Lawrence hypnotically repeats, “Cause you’re fading / The game you play has changed.” Even though Disclosure eviscerates the mystery subject of the track, veterans should still thank the duo for helping him them find the next big thing. Much like previous singles “Latch” and “White Noise,” “Jaded” perfectly plays into what young electronic enthusiasts crave: something that feels at home in both an exhilarating European club and trendy London cocktail bar. Despite its name, “Jaded” feels remarkably fresh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
As my 10-year reunion approaches, I am gratified that there finally seems to be a community-wide reckoning of sexual assault on campus ("Survey Reveals ‘Troubling’ Sexual Assault Climate at Harvard, Faust Says"). With results of a campus-wide survey showing that one in three female Harvard seniors has experienced sexual assault during her time on campus, we can no longer ignore that Harvard’s culture allows rape to happen and ignores it when it does. What was left unsaid in the survey, however, deserves as much attention as these disturbing numbers.
Where do these assaults occur? There is a vague reference to “recognized and unrecognized student organizations.” One cannot help but assume that these unsanctioned places are final clubs, which, official or not, dominate student life on campus. Because of Harvard’s strategy of disengagement, however, they have become a free-for-all, where sexual assault is understood as the potential price of admission. Even more disturbing, as these are private residences, police cannot enter without probable cause, and they exist in a kind of policing no-man’s land.
We should demand to know how many assaults have occurred at the clubs, how many have been reported, and how many actually prosecuted. Harvard’s administrators have been understandably reluctant to confront these powerful organizations and their well-connected alumni, and instead have allowed their female undergraduates to be assaulted weekend after weekend.
I urge the University to release the results of the survey detailing where these assaults occurred and, if they are occurring at the final clubs, to absorb these clubs back into the university so that they will no longer be able to flout Harvard’s policies. Most importantly, I urge Harvard to create a commission for investigating assault that includes student advocates, sexual assault experts, and members of law enforcement. Rape is a crime, not a matter for gentlemen to resolve behind closed doors, and it’s time to start treating it as such.

To the editor:
My first class at Harvard, in the fall of 1985, was Modern Political Ideologies, co-taught by Stanley Hoffmann and Judith Shklar ("Stanley Hoffmann, Iconic Professor and Scholar, Dies at 86"). Hoffmann was tall, poised, seemingly imperturbable—though when he stood on the dais and tucked one leg underneath himself, I couldn’t help feeling I was being lectured on Marx and John Stuart Mill by the world’s most brilliant stork.
All semester long Hoffmann and Shklar laid out facts cogently, unfolded compelling theories. On the last day, they invited questions on any topic. I’d been shy and hidden all semester, but I screwed up my courage and raised my hand. Had they ever found communism, well, personally appealing?
Shklar stayed silent, but Hoffmann nodded. “You must understand that for a young man, say a young man from a Jewish family growing up in a France that had been torn apart by Nazism, and seemingly rescued by forces loyal to the ideals of communism, the appeal might be strong, even well-nigh irresistible.”
He paused, rocked gently in his stork pose for a while, then started up again. “But, in retrospect…" This time, he trailed off for good. After a semester of perfectly formed and complete sentences, it’s this fragment that hangs in my head, 30 years later.

A new front has opened in the ongoing battle over the efficacy and equity of standardized testing, and Harvard’s peer institutions appear to be leading the charge. The current issue is whether or not schools should require the essay portions of the SAT and ACT, which half of the Ivy League has now moved to make optional. Harvard is one holdout.
Though the correlation between general standardized test performance and income is troubling, Harvard is right to continue reviewing the predictive value of SAT and ACT essays instead of immediately scrapping them: Standardized tests have great practical importance that Harvard should not discount. Taken as a part of a larger application, standardized tests have predictive power, and serve as a key point of comparison between people from varied backgrounds. As long as colleges understand tests' limits and biases, the SAT and ACT will continue to be an invaluable part of the admissions process.
Standardized tests provide a dimension to the application that the transcript, recommendation, and personal statement do not: a common metric against which all students are judged. The SAT and ACT, including the essay sections, are measures of pure performance. Though the tests may be flawed, university admissions officers are aware of their issues and often evaluate the many ways in which they could improve. William R. Fitzsimmsons ’67, Harvard College’s Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, has had intimate involvement in the reform of the SAT, and the changes in the works for the SAT and ACT essay sections reflect a similar exchange of views between admissions administrators and the tests’ designers.
Standardized tests are also far from the sole arbiter of a student’s fate: The SAT and ACT give colleges a common system for determining where students are academically, and the other of the application tells them how the student got there. At a college like Harvard with a holistic philosophy of admissions, few decisions are made on the sole basis of test scores, and certainly not on the sole basis of the timed essay section.
It would be easy to criticize Harvard for appearing to follow rather than lead in this instance, given the number of peer institutions who have made the essay section optional. But there is little point in leading to the wrong destination. Though standardized tests alone are imperfect, so is any measure of student achievement. With more metrics, a college can get a fuller picture of an applicant. Harvard should want the fullest picture it can capture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Republican Party’s typical position is to preemptively surrender whenever liberals start yelling, ‘Oh that’s mean. You can’t use that word.’ ‘Oh, I did not realize that the New York Times made a finding that the term... is offensive. Henceforth I shall not use it.’ Well... now Americans are finding out... the policies of these speech Nazis.”
Nothing like a grossly offensive quote by Ann Coulter to get you hot and bothered.
I’m not writing this article to discuss Ann Coulter, “anchor babies” (about which she was speaking), or specifics about the back and forth between liberal and conservative ideologies, though. We’ll set those aside as bloodbaths for another time.
Hard at the forefront of the American mind, the card pulled at the drop of any accusation of insensitivity, the supposed totalitarian weapon of you-can’t-say-that, this article is about the concept of political correctness. God’s second great flood.
Whether or not the term itself was on people’s tongues, society growing more “politically correct” has provided the cornerstone of America’s sociopolitical progressivism for literally ever. It’s the idea that words carry the weight of change, that sentiments of individuals build into those of the masses—that your thoughts and actions have a direct influence on your world.
As of late, particularly in light of the campaign of a certain presidential candidate who will remain unnamed but who looks like a sad tangerine wearing a cornhusk bonnet, political correctness has come under fire as a means of censorship, sugar coating, and silencing. Those who speak out against this accusation are labeled as the hypersensitive, unable to talk the hard talk for fear of offending someone. For some reason, knowing how to talk about certain delicate issues without being a runaway bulldozer about it is seen as a sign of weakness.
Let’s unpack this for a minute.
Here’s the thing about political incorrectness for those on the side of the shriveled real estate camel growing a failed chia pet out of his skull: There will always be a reason that, for example, calling a black person “colored,” even jokingly, warrants a broken nose and calling me a “fruitcake” warrants me lathering you in a thick layer of honey and dropping you into a bee orgy. Why? Because the immediate message of such “meanness” (to use Coulter’s word) is that you don’t in the least respect the person about whom you’re speaking. That the negative connotations and historical associations of the labels you slap onto their foreheads somehow don’t send them back fifty years to a time when they were afraid to exist. That you are an enormous, counterproductive, armadillo dropping.
Let’s deal some facts: The accusation of hypersensitivity will only ever hold merit insofar as it polices the ability to discuss difficult but necessary topics for fear of causing offense. When sensitivity turns to instability and cowardice, a step in the tougher direction is warranted. But in general, such an accusation is a smothering blanket for those who know how to attach kindness and understanding to discussions of the most difficult sociopolitical issues. Overbearing political correctness will always be the card pulled when people’s ignorance overrides their ability to step on fragile ice without plunging their foot right through it.
Because here’s the rub: The concoction of the term “political correctness” is nothing more or less than the politicization of basic human respect and decency for the purpose of rendering both negotiable controversies. It’s a strategic tool, and as a term for that which should be a natural and inarguable part of the human experience, it is, ultimately, a complete and utter myth.
Yes, black people used to be called “colored.” Yes, queer people used to be referred to as “fruitcakes” (in fact, we used to be derogatorily referred to as “queers” until we reclaimed the term as our own). In a time when these minority groups were marginalized to an unlivable extent, there was far more that people were ignorant about than there is today. But as we have come to know better, so too must we come to be better. By denying the need to speak carefully and respectfully in this regard and instead politicizing it and labeling it a hindrance, you refuse to be better.
The paradox, of course, is that registering a hypersensitive complaint with the office of wow-why-would-you-say-something-like-that leaves you wide open for the exact kind of return argument that I’m refuting: being told not to be so offended by something offensive. But that’s an asinine, inescapable loop, and we have to fight back in spite of it. We have to stay unyieldingly, unapologetically hot and bothered. We mustn’t let people take away the most fundamental tools of expressing respect for someone, nor must we allow them to use our defense of those tools against us in an accusation of overbearing political correctness. Those people simply refuse to be better, and that will never be the right answer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Summer after summer, middle school friends would return to the classroom in August recounting tales of tremendous adventures and exploits from the previous few months. Things would range from mountain climbing to sleep-away camp to working at the pool, but seemingly every story featured a recurring theme: a girl. A girl who, “Dude, she was perfect.” She got her braces off like two years ago. She sometimes played Call of Duty, and her mom let her stay out until 11. You began to envision what such a girl could even look like, and how you could have possibly overlooked someone so ostensibly perfect for you, but just a few short words snapped the trance: “She doesn’t go here, though.” Ahh, you immediately realized: She isn’t real. Now, however, this absent love interest no longer rings synonymous with hyperbole and fabrication to me.
I wasn’t very socially savvy growing up. I didn’t have a girlfriend, and fabricating one would have merely exacerbated her absence. But after some unusual circumstances (we ran against each other for a student council position), I began to fall for a girl. My feelings were reciprocated, the previously unimaginable began to come into view, and it was great. So great, in fact, that even though I was heading to Harvard and she was off to Pepperdine, we made the conscious decision to continue our relationship at our respective schools, despite what felt like staggering odds against us, and the common advice of ditching your high school sweetheart.
Not only does she not go here, but she really doesn’t go here: Almost 3,000 miles away, a six-hour plane ride (or for someone on my budget, a 980-hour walk). Malibu is about as far away as you can get from Boston within the contiguous United States, but in today’s day and age, that really doesn’t matter.
Due in part to the advent of state-of-the-art technologies like FaceTime, Snapchat, and hug shirts, maintaining communication in a long distance relationship is increasingly possible, and people are taking advantage. Previously avoided by anyone other than married couples temporarily forced into one by military service or job transfers, more and more couples are electing to make things work from far away. According to a 2014 study, approximately 14 million Americans are in a long distance relationship, and marriages only account for about a quarter of those.
Perhaps as a result of these improved telecommunications, or perhaps because Buzzfeed published Why Your Long Distance Relationship is Totally Worth It, college-aged students have become a larger portion of the “LDR” pie. Nowadays, approximately 33 percent of college students claim to have participated in an LDR, a number that increases drastically when expanded to include flings between Mather and Quad residents.
Although there are certainly drawbacks, research on the subject has provided distant lovers at least some solace. A Journal of Communication study found that “men and women in long distance relationships were more likely to share meaningful thoughts and feelings, leading to a greater sense of intimacy,” which in turn may explain why only about 40 percent of established long distance relationships end in a breakup, compared to 85 percent of all couples. Although a certain amount of selection bias may emerge from the fact that those in a long distance relationship tend to be more serious to begin with, effective communication is key to sustaining a meaningful bond.
I probably won’t see Grace again in person until next month, but we already have a slew of things lined up for when she gets here. Perhaps that is the greatest strength of a long distance relationship: We have to be intentional with our time. With such a limited amount of it, none can be squandered with laziness, passivity, or a meaningless fight. Every moment spent together is an investment that pays enormous dividends in making those 3,000 miles feel a whole lot closer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 23, 2015, at 4:35 a.m.
Harvard's endowment rose to $37.6 billion on returns of 5.8 percent in the 2015 fiscal year, beating most of its internal benchmarks and the general market indices but lagging behind notable peer institutions such as MIT and Stanford.
The annual returns, reported by Harvard Management Company president and chief executive officer Stephen Blyth in a letter to alumni that was released Tuesday, were the first issued under Blyth’s leadership, less than a year after he took over in January to high expectations.
While some peer institutions have yet to release their returns, Harvard’s investment gains were again outpaced by Stanford and MIT, whose endowments saw returns of 7 and 13.2 percent, respectively. Harvard beat the University of Texas system’s returns of 3.4 percent and the Standard and Poor’s 500 index of 4.5 percent over the same period.
In his letter on Tuesday, Blyth outlined an overhauled investment approach and plans to rework HMC’s compensation to tie bonuses more to the fund's overall progress. As he took office mid-fiscal year, and because large institutional investors deal with significant illiquidity, Blyth is likely still implementing major aspects of his approach.
Even so, however, the endowment’s meager performance comes as Harvard is mounting a major fundraising campaign, which has increased scrutiny on the fund’s returns.
HMC’s returns in real estate this year exceeded expectations, with a return of 19.4 percent, beating internal benchmarks by 7.9 percent, the highest of all asset classes. Real estate investments compose 12 percent of Harvard’s portfolio. The critical aspect of real estate’s success in FY 2015 lies in Harvard’s direct real estate investment program managed internally by HMC, which returned 35.5 percent.
But HMC performed extremely poorly in the “absolute return” asset class, which consists of outside investments to hedge funds. The class returned 0.1 percent, missing the internal benchmark of 3.5 percent, the only asset class that fell short of internal benchmarks. Blyth wrote that the main reasons for the failure in absolute return were failures of outside managers and major losses in shipping investments.
Within private equity, led by Richard L. Hall ’90, HMC returned 11.8 percent, beating HMC-set benchmarks by 1.1 percent. The private equity division’s venture capital investments returned 29.6 percent, driven by technology and biotech investments.
While Blyth highlighted the success of U.S. public equities, which returned 12.4 percent and beat its benchmark by 5.2 percent, HMC took a haircut on equities in foreign and emerging market equities, which experienced negative returns of -1.8 percent and -2.2 percent, respectively. Blyth rationalized the hits in those two classes, writing that “strength of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies led to lower nominal returns in developed and emerging markets.”
The Management Company returned 15.4 percent in FY 2014, but these returns still were behind the average 16.5 percent returns of peer academic institutions with endowments of more than $1 billion. According to Blyth’s letter, HMC placed fourth in five-year annualized endowment returns of America’s top 10 largest endowments from FY 2011 through FY 2014.
This poor performance relative to peer institutions had been a common theme for HMC under the tenure of Jane L. Mendillo, who stepped down from her position as CEO in late 2014. Just after Mendillo took over the helm of HMC in 2008, the global financial crisis hit Harvard particularly hard. The endowment lost $11 billion and Mendillo spent much of her tenure creating liquidity to meet budgetary shortfalls, especially within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

For the second year running, Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” has edged out Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” for the title of the semester’s largest undergraduate course at Harvard.
As of Tuesday afternoon, CS50 touted a roster of 703 undergraduates, while Ec 10 had enrolled 700, according to course enrollment data compiled by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar. 
The Registrar’s office posted these course enrollment numbers online after add/drop period—when students can enroll in or withdraw from courses without a fee—ended Monday at midnight, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke. Course enrollment numbers will continue to be updated daily, Burke wrote in an email.
The two largest undergraduate courses, Harvard’s flagship classes in Computer Science and Economics, have consistently drawn hundreds of College students over the past few semesters. Ec 10 has maintained its standing as one of the College’s largest courses in both the fall and spring terms. And last fall, CS50 logged a record-breaking total of undergraduate enrollees.
Having expanded to New Haven this semester, CS50 now can add “Yale’s most popular course” to its bevy of titles. There are 510 students enrolled in the Yale version of the course—called Computer Science 100: “Introduction to Computing and Programming”—represening about 10 percent of Yale undergraduates, according to The Yale Daily News.
Students flock to CS50 in part because many industries have growing interests in computer science, according to David J. Malan ’99, a Computer Science professor of the practice who teaches the course. Malan also hopes CS50 attracts “students more and less comfortable alike...irrespective of prior background,” he wrote in an email.
“I'd also hope it's a reflection of the course's accessibility, culture, and rigor,” Malan wrote, discussing his thoughts about the course’s consistently high enrollment.
Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who teaches Ec 10, also said his course’s practical implications prompt a large number of undergraduates to take the course. Students are attracted to economics because they want to be “well-informed” citizens, Mankiw wrote in an email.
“I keep wondering: Why isn’t every Harvard first-year student taking [E]c 10?” Mankiw wrote.
For both course instructors, however, large class sizes have pros and cons.
“The main advantage is that it provides a common focal experience for Harvard students,” Mankiw wrote about Ec 10. “The main disadvantage is that I don’t get to know all the students individually.”
Malan echoed Mankiw, writing that teaching large numbers of students places new demands on course staff.
“We've certainly had to build out the course's support structure all the more,” Malan wrote. “Wonderfully, though, the more students who take the course, the more candidates we have for future TFs and CAs!”

The Undergraduate Council has created its first-ever alumni advisory board.
According to UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the alumni board “is tasked with keeping UC alumni informed and engaged … with current UC projects, initiatives, and developments.” 
The current and primary focus of the Council’s alumni board is to foster relationships between College alumni and current UC representatives, said Lowell House representative Berkeley Brown ’18, who spearheaded the initiative. The board contains a “diverse group” of alumni from a variety of class years and academic disciplines, according to Brown.
While Goyal said the board’s purpose will be to utilize Harvard’s vast alumni network to develop strong, mentorship-like relationships between current and previous UC representatives, he added that the Council has not ruled out using the alumni council to seek donations from alumni in the future.
Securing additional sources of funding, particularly for student groups, was a priority on the Council among previous leadership. Former UC leaders Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15 embarked on an unsuccessful campaign, dubbed the “UC 250K,” in 2014 to seek $250,000 in additional funding from Harvard’s top administrators.
A key campaign platform point of Goyal and UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh last November, meanwhile, was securing alumni funding to support student groups.
When conceptualizing the board, Brown said she intended it to act in an advisory capacity with the Council, given that the UC is a student group without a faculty adviser. In the past, the UC has operated efficiently without a faculty adviser, but Nasrollahzadeh has cited a limited pool of opinions from outside of the Council as a driving factor behind the creation of this board.
According to Brown, the Council solicited participants in the alumni group through contacts from the Harvard Alumni Association. Current UC representatives sent out applications to UC-affiliated alumni and then chose potential candidates for the advisory board from submitted applications.
Part of the responsibility that comes alongside creating the advisory board includes the publication of a semi-annual alumni newsletter in order to brief alumni on goings-on within the Council, Brown said.

Harvard affiliates and Cantabrigians listened to local musician Patrick Yerby perform modern pop and classic rock songs at a “pop-up” concert in the Science Center Plaza on Tuesday afternoon, part of a series of recent performances there.
Yerby, a guitarist and vocalist who plays a range of covers and original material, emphasized that the concert offered a chance to practice performing.
“Any kind of opportunity where you can play in front of people is awesome,” Yerby said. “In a city like Boston where there’s so many talented musicians, sometimes there are fewer gigs per musician than there should be.”
One attendee also noted the benefit of a venue for demonstrating artistic talent.
“It’s great that there’s a space for performers who want to make it—to have a space for them to showcase their talents is awesome,” Stephen J. Kim ’15-’16 said.
The concerts are part of a University-wide effort introduced in the summer of 2009, after University President Drew G. Faust assembled a Committee on Common Spaces in 2008. The initiative, known as Common Spaces, seeks to liven up Harvard’s public spaces with artistic performances and workshops, according to Lara E. Adams, the associate director of common spaces operations.
“It’s a really fun space,” said Adams, referring to the Science Center Plaza. “The community loves it, the students love it.”
Common Spaces organizers initially chose performers primarily from students in Harvard’s arts programs, but more recently, they have invited performers from the Boston area more generally. Students, faculty members, and local residents alike are welcome to indicate their interest in performing through a form on the Common Spaces website, Adams said.
Several spectators said they were pleased with the opportunity to hear live music as they went about their days.
“It's kind of nice to just sit here and eat lunch, listen to the music and go back to whatever you were doing,” said Tomasz Macieik, who works as a lab technician at a Faculty of Arts and Sciences lab.
"It's really very lovely,” said Mark Z. Jia, a student at Harvard Law School. “I wish it were here every day.”

The Harvard Art Museums has appointed two new curators to its European and American art division and its Asian and Mediterranean art division and made two internal promotions within its Division of European and American Art.
Ethan W. Lasser—who had served as the acting leader of the European and American art branch since December 2014—has officially been named its head and assumed a newly endowed position as the first Theodore E. Stebbins, Jr., Curator of American Art. 
For her part, Rachel M. Saunders will begin next month in her role as the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Associate Curator of Asian Art in the Division of Asian and Mediterranean Art, also a newly endowed position. She had completed her dissertation at the University on a 14th-century Japanese handscroll earlier this year.
A. Cassandra Albinson was appointed the Margaret S. Winthrop Curator of European Art, and Elizabeth M. Rudy, was named the new Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Associate Curator of Prints. Rudy has been at the museums since 2011.
According a press release, the four curators have “deep expertise in key areas of the museums’ world-class collections” and “will help fulfill the promise” of the Harvard Art Museums’ new building, which reopened last November following a six-year renovation project that integrated three University’s art museums under one roof.
The curatorial appointees said they were eager to use the expanded facility to work with counterparts from other divisions to develop new exhibitions.
Noting that Harvard’s galleries are largely organized by chronology and theme, rather than by culture, Lasser said there is ample opportunity for collaboration across art divisions.
“Our job now is to create programs and exhibitions that live up to the architecture [of the building],” Lasser said, adding that he was “thrilled” to soon work with other curatorial experts.
Saunders said the new building provides an “extraordinary opportunity” for changing and evolving how works are exhibited.
“One of the things that makes the Harvard Art Museums unique is that you’ll see different mediums of art included in galleries together,” Albinson said.
Albinson added that the diverse mediums of work included in individual galleries provide another way for curators to learn from one another about the museums’ collections and how the rotations of artwork in the galleries take place.
The appointments were initiated and completed before former the Art Museums’ for director, Thomas W. Lentz, stepped down from his position in July, according to the press release.
Albinson and Lasser have already taken up their curatorial duties at the Harvard Art Museums. Saunders and Rudy will begin their new appointments in mid-October.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a discussion Tuesday in the Lowell House small dining room, Michelle P. Gallant, a clinical dietitian at Harvard University Health Services, explained to a group of about 20 attendees how to stay healthy and happy through a concept called “intuitive eating.”
Gallant began the discussion, organized by the Harvard College Health Advocacy Program, by covering a few principles fundamental to intuitive eating, such as the elimination of unsustainable fad diets from ideology and lifestyle.
“Intuitive eating is about having a healthy relationship with food and your body,” Gallant said. “It’s about enjoying food and honoring your body’s signals of hunger and fullness. Intuitive eating means letting go of all the guilt that surrounds food.”
After an initial introduction of this eating lifestyle, Gallant discussed a few other essentials when adopting intuitive eating. She said students must be reliable about feeding themselves whenever they are hungry and constantly engage with their bodies while eating to determine if they are full and how different foods make them feel.
In response to one question about late-night snacking from an attendee, Gallant commented that students should have good snacks available in rooms and never go to sleep hungry. She recommended a process of trial and error to find the foods that enabled students to perform at high productivity late in the night. Some foods she recommended to begin with included yogurt, fruit, wholegrain crackers, and popcorn.
In an interview, event co-organizer Justin S. Reynolds ’17 emphasized the negative impact of many modern dieting practices.
“When it comes to fad diets I would say they are terrible and doing more harm than good. They make people think the wrong way about food … Eating has been and should always be a natural process,” said Reynolds.
Gita Bhattacharya ’16, another organizer of the discussion, said she wanted to expose other members of the College to the lifestyle of intuitive eating.
“I think there is a huge shift for students when they come from high school to college as [they] are coming from a very structured environment of food where someone is cooking for [them], to an environment where there is so much choice and an unlimited meal plan, which can be very overwhelming for some,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a school year that brought social justice issues to the forefront of campus dialogue, Harvard Law School students have started formally organizing to discuss their experiences and what they say are the shortcomings of the curriculum. 
At a Saturday event, titled “Disorientation,” students gathered to attend a series of panel discussions, breakout sessions, and training sessions about social justice issues and their presence, or lack thereof, in the Law School curriculum, particularly during the first year. The student groups Students for Inclusion and the Harvard chapter of the National Lawyers Guild organized the day-long event.
“It was put together sort of to be a response to orientation and a response to some of the reactions students maybe have when they first get to law school,” said Faye E. Maison, a third-year Law student who helped organize the event. “Just to say there are a bunch of other people have been through this and are having the same thoughts you do.”
Both Maison and Mihal R. Ansik, another third-year law student who helped organize the event, said the initial impetus for the event was what they described as the insensitivity of the Law School classroom to social justice perspectives.
“Something that we all experienced during our [first year] and that tends to happen is, if you’re a student interested in social justice or a student of color or part of a marginalized community in some way, you start to realize you’re being taught law and certain cases where you’re supposed to justify injustice to be part of the class,” Ansik said during an interview.
“A lot of the real world bits are missing,” Maison said.
Some students who are just beginning their careers at the Law School—the target audience for the event—said after the event that it was a meaningful experience.
“I think that it was probably the most valuable so far in my experience. In my three weeks as a law student, I think it was a highlight, actually,” said Annemarie Manhardt, a first-year student who attended the event.
After a question and answer session titled “Surviving 1L As A Social Justice Advocate,” a “Radical Lawyering Panel” took place.
Thena Robinson-Mock, from the Advancement Project, Carl Williams of the Massachusetts chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Boston Coalition for Police Accountability, and Oren Nimni, co-chair of the United People of Color Caucus of the National Lawyers Guild, spoke at the panel. Students were also trained as legal observers at the event.
Though it was the first time a “Disorientation” event happened at the Law School, the National Lawyers Guild has organized similar events at schools around the country. Students said it was an opportunity to build a community of like-minded students at the Law School.
“There is a community at the Law School that is committed to social justice and changing the way legal education operates at the Law School,” Ansik said.

When Lowell House becomes the fifth residence to undergo construction as part of Harvard’s House renewal project, the neo-Georgian building will almost certainly feature new floor plans, elevators, and enhanced common spaces.
What is less certain, however, is whether it will still feature a rock climbing wall.
For nearly a decade, Lowell’s basement has housed the Lowell Bouldering Wall, a central hub for the College’s club climbing team and mountaineering club. Now, in advance of the House’s renovation, hundreds of students have signed a petition calling for it to still exist at the conclusion of construction in 2018. 
The movement, which has already amassed 690 signatures and was organized by a group of students who staff the wall, comes as administrators hold preliminary discussions about construction plans to prepare for renewal beginning in 2017.
So far, through renewal of Quincy’s Stone Hall, Leverett’s McKinlock Hall, and most recently all of Dunster House, administrators have focused on rethinking common spaces to revitalize House life. That’s meant dramatic changes to House basements, and a move away from private spaces like in-suite bathrooms.
House renewal, a major capital campaign priority, is expected to cost more than $1 billion overall, and the planning process for each project is extensive. Harvard has not yet released detailed plans for Lowell, and according to House Master Diana L. Eck, administrators have not yet made a decision about the future of the wall in their discussions with architects. It will be a matter of discussion as Lowell moves forward with the project, she wrote in an email.
In the meantime, a vocal group of students is making it clear that they want the popular wall, a unique part of Lowell, to stay. According to William H. Bloxham ’17, the wall manager who helped organize the petition, more than 400 people use it every semester, and it fosters a sense of community among climbers.
“A lot of climbers are down there for four, five, or six nights a week, either to get better at climbing, get some exercise, or hang out with people,” Bloxham said. “It really kind of brings the climbing community at Harvard together.”
Cody He ’16, a member of Harvard’s club climbing team, agreed, saying that the wall is not only a stepping stone to become seriously involved in the sport of climbing—it is also a space for community.
“The climbing wall is really a place open for everyone and there’s kind of community around it,” He said. “It’s a place where you can meet people, climb hard, and hang out.”
Kevin Parker ’16, the club climbing team’s captain, described the climbing wall as “a big part of Lowell” and posited that through construction administrators could do more than preserve the space—they could extend it and integrate it into Harvard’s athletic facilities.
Organizers plan to send the petition, along with a letter further detailing arguments in favor of keeping the wall, to various administrators next week, according to Bloxham.

Elisa Villanueva Beard—who was named co-chief executive officer of Teach for America in 2013 and assumed sole CEO responsibilities this month—argued for the need for diversity and commitment among educators to a crowd of Harvard affiliates in Ticknor Lounge Tuesday night.
“We need folks from all backgrounds that have lots of passion … people that share the background of our kids, people that don’t,” Beard said. “Talent just matters. It’s so central to getting anything done.”
Villanueva Beard, who said she grew up in a relatively low-income area where most adults had not attended college, highlighted her own challenges and obstacles often faced by undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds when she entered higher education.
“I was so underprepared for college,” she said. “It was traumatizing.”
Beard’s visit to the University comes in a period of heated controversy in the field of education. Opponents of Teach for America have voiced concerns that the two-year commitment for TFA teachers risks undermining the quality of education received by students in low-income communities, and the Student Labor Action Movement, an on-campus student activist group, protested for Harvard to sever its connection to TFA last year.
In response to the recent criticism, Beard said that realistically, most young college graduates now do not envision holding one form of employment indefinitely.
“Those days are over when we’re asking anybody to commit to anything for a lifetime,” Beard said. “I think it’s easy to critique an organization because we’re organized … but I don’t think it’s fair.”
She added that people with an interest in teaching should be supported in, rather than dissuaded from, pursuing opportunities in education and achieving impact, arguing that partisan politics should be removed from the discussion of education reform in favor of an overall vision for the American education system. In particular, she said, 21st century demands on students, such as proficiency in STEM fields and preparedness in a global economy, need to be taken into account.
“Our schools don’t work for our kids today,” Beard said. “It’s just a design question.”
For its part, TFA aims to bolster its community and recruit next-generation innovators while ensuring it delivers on its promise to impact its affiliated schools, according to Beard.
“There is no silver bullet. There is no one organization solving the problem,” Beard said. “We need the most talented people this country has to offer... to be able to contribute, whether it’s directly in education or outside of it."
Students who attended the event generally praised the discussion.
“I think it’s really awesome that we filled the room. No matter what end of the spectrum you’re on, it’s just a ton of passion about education,” Eliza M. Chang ’16 said.
The Office of Career Services and 1vyG, an interscholastic network among first-generation college undergraduates in Ivy League universities, co-hosted the discussion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Carey W. Gabay ’94, a former president of Harvard's Undergraduate Council, died last Wednesday, after he was caught in the crossfire of a shooting in New York City the previous week. He was 43.
Gabay was attending a celebration before the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn, N.Y., when the shooting began, according to The New York Times. He was declared brain-dead last Tuesday night and taken off a respirator.
Gabay’s classmates and co-representatives on the UC remember him as a dedicated and committed leader. Gabay’s devotion to public service did not end after his graduation—at the time of his death, Gabay worked as an administrative lawyer and aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. He graduated from the College and also attended Harvard Law School.
During his time at Harvard, Gabay served as UC president at one of the most diverse periods the Council had seen. When Gabay took office, he did so as one of the Council's first top African-American leaders.
This came at a time when diversity at the College was increasingly under scrutiny, with some describing Harvard’s campus as “hostile to minorities.”
Throughout his tenure as president of the College student body, Gabay was continuously praised by classmates for his leadership and passion. In a letter to The Crimson’s editors in 1994, then-UC vice president Joshua D. Liston ’95 wrote that Gabay’s “tireless leadership and commitment to the student body was inspiring for all of us,” arguing that Gabay presented every campus issue and differing views with “precision and clarity.”
Another letter to the editor in 1994, from Jonathan K. Hsu ’94, called Gabay a “tireless worker,” a “true leader,” and a “true gentleman.”
Both Hsu and Liston noted in their letters to the editor that Gabay’s work rarely received the recognition and respect it merited.
“Carey Gabay was a… great student leader, a wonderful American story, but above all, he was a friend to many,” said another UC alumnus, Michael P. Beys ’94. “He had all the qualities of leadership, intelligence, [and] a love [for] public service.”
Melissa Garza ’94, who ran against Gabay in a UC presidential election, called him a “beautiful person” with a clear-cut vision for the Council.
“He was very engaging and persuasive,” she added.
“Carey stood out from everyone else… with his ability to like and be liked,” Beys added. “He didn’t have a bad bone in his body.”
A funeral service for Gabay is planned for Saturday in Brooklyn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 23, 2015, at 4:35 a.m. 
In his first annual letter to alumni as Harvard Management Company’s president and chief executive officer, Stephen Blyth laid out sweeping changes to Harvard’s investment arm.
Blyth, who took over for Jane L. Mendillo on Jan. 1, made it clear Tuesday that he plans to chart a new course as CEO. Changes coming to the company include a new compensation model, Blyth said, as well as an overhauled investment approach, the introduction of core objectives, and an explicit goal to perform in the top quartile of the next 10 most valuable university endowments.
Blyth detailed the changes in an annual letter that came as Harvard announced a 5.8 percent investment return, which once once again trailed major peer institutions like Stanford (7 percent) and MIT (13.2 percent), though it beat the University of Texas System (3.4 percent). While HMC beat the median endowment return, Blyth acknowledged that “it is unlikely that our return in fiscal year 2015 will materially improve our performance relative to our endowment peer group.” On average, endowments of higher value outperform their smaller competitors.
Among the salient issues the new CEO touched on was compensation. Blyth outlined a plan to change HMC’s compensation method, writing that he aims to tie more of portfolio manager compensation to components linked to the overall success of HMC.
“Fostering a deeper sense of ownership in the overall success of HMC amongst all our staff, and developing a true sense of partnership amongst senior investment professionals at HMC, are key priorities for me,” Blyth wrote in the letter.
In the letter, Blyth also offered candid evaluations of the $37.6 billion fund’s performance in each asset class and a sober assessment of Mendillo’s performance in her last four years, when HMC’s returns were fourth in the top 10 endowments each year from a rolling five-year annualized view.
“HMC must remain competitive for Harvard itself to confidently maintain its own preeminence as a University,” Blyth wrote. “However, recent performance against [the top 10 endowments] metric has been disappointing.”
Blyth set two other overarching objectives. He said the fund will seek to earn a real return of at least 5 percent on a 10-year annualized basis and that it will aim to outperform market and industry benchmarks by at least 1 percent when annualized over five years.
The biggest potential break from the past, though, was a multi-page-long exposition on what Blyth called HMC’s new investment approach and dubbed, “Flexible Indeterminate Factor-based Asset Allocation,” or FIFAA. While a more complete explanation of the framework is expected to be published in the Journal of Portfolio Management in 2016, Blyth described the approach as one “that is capable of expressing less quantifiable investment ideas and objectives around a rigorous core.” He added that the framework will divide the overall portfolio into “systematic ‘factor’” and “non-systematic ‘residual’” components.
Previously, HMC set a “Policy Portfolio” of asset class distributions for each fiscal year in its annual reports. The current model, according to Blyth’s letter, instead gives general ranges—some as large as 13 percentage points—which will give HMC more flexibility.
At the conclusion of his letter, Blyth commented on his overall outlook on the financial sector. He wrote that generally inflated private equity valuations have produced an environment which he said is “likely to result in lower future returns than in recent past” in that asset category.
Private equity has been a popular investment sector for HMC in recent years, steadily increasing its investments in the sector since 2009. Due to Harvard’s liquidity constraints during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, HMC was forced to sell many of its investments in private equity before they matured.
Blyth commented on future Federal Reserve policy, writing that HMC is in the midst of “analyzing potential effects of higher rates throughout the portfolio, in particular examining the possibility of second order effects if many asset classes...were to decline simultaneously.” The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates at some point later this year or early in 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting in a cramped Quincy House senior common room on Tuesday night, about two dozen students reacted to recently released findings about the incidence of sexual assault at Harvard, telling administrators about a climate of distrust on campus and questioning if the College can change it.
Students and administrators discussed the topic in a “lively” back-and-forth of about 90 minutes, according to Aaron M. Mukerjee ’16, a student who attended the town hall, which was not open to the press. Students and administrators addressed topics such as on-campus party space and training student bystanders to intervene and stop incidents of assault, Mukerjee said.
The town hall was the first of several the College plans to hold this week in response to what administrators have called the “anguishing” results of a University-wide sexual conduct climate survey, developed by the Association of American Universities and also administered on 26 other campuses last spring. 
Among other points, the survey found that more than 30 percent of female undergraduate seniors at the College surveyed reported being victims of some kind of sexual misconduct during their time at Harvard, while many respondents said they lacked knowledge of and confidence in the University’s response resources. The results come as the College faces a federal investigation into its compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
Although people at the town hall event on Tuesday said they found the statistics disturbing, they also found them unsurprising, Mukerjee said.
Students at the meeting made several suggestions, according to Colin J.F. Diersing ’16, who also attended. They called for more inclusive social spaces on campus, like a student bar or more private common rooms in the Houses, he said; attendees also suggested that better sexual assault prevention education programming be included throughout all four years of students’ time at the College.
According to Mukerjee, students also noted undergraduates’ pessimism in Harvard’s ability to make tangible change on the issues at hand.
Discussion about social space addressed a recent topic of administrative scrutiny—the College’s single-gender and unrecognized final clubs—but also touched on sanctioned space, like the upperclassman Houses, according to Diersing.
According to the Harvard-specific survey results released Monday, more than 75 percent of sexual assaults reported by female College seniors reportedly occurred in dormitories, while about 15 percent happened at “single-sex organizations that are not fraternities or sororities,” a category that was designed to include Harvard’s final clubs.
At Tuesday’s town hall, students argued that existing campus social spaces outside final clubs are insufficient, according to Mukerjee, and some suggested that future House renewal projects include more private common rooms.
Harvard is in the process of renovating its upperclassman Houses, and in construction projects completed so far, administrators have prioritized creating more building-wide common spaces at the expense of some private space, creating some hallway double and single bedrooms and hall bathrooms.
For her part, attendee Jessica C. Levy ’18 said administrators were receptive to student comments and “cleared the air” when they switched to a new topic. “Satisfied” is not the right word to describe her feelings after the event, Levy said, since concrete policy change and action have yet to happen, but she said she appreciates that conversation on the issue is now happening.
Luke A. Leafgren, the resident dean in Mather House who facilitated the discussion, called the tone of the meeting “constructive.”
Administrators including Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, College Title IX coordinator Emily J. Miller, and various House masters, tutors, and deans attended the event. Mukerjee, for his part, said he would have liked to see more students go, but he added that students dominated the conversation.
Administrators held a similar town hall meeting in Harvard Yard, in Straus Hall, on Tuesday as well. They will hold two more this week, on Wednesday in Leverett and Pforzheimer Houses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With more reporters than expected showing up for the Harvard-University of Rhode Island tilt, the front row of the Meade Stadium press box was probably about 10 feet too short and 10 degrees too hot to be comfortable for any of the media.
But if there was a silver lining to being pressed up against the door leading to the URI coaches’ booth—and seeing the coaches’ athletic abilities as they leapt over my chair anytime they wanted to leave said booth—it was definitely the thin walls and the ensuing entertainment value.
It began early. Just three minutes into the game, senior quarterback Scott Hosch threw a short screen to junior tight end Ryan Halvorson, who powered forward for seven yards and the first down. As soon as Halvorson caught the ball and turned, shouted expletives—presumably from the defensive coaches—emerged from the closed door, continuing well after the tight end was dragged down past midfield into Rams territory.
A brief moment of quiet followed. And then, on the next play, Hosch dropped back, gazed around the field with ample protection, and—to the dismay of my next-door neighbors, who began shouting ‘No!’ repeatedly before the ball had even left the hands of No. 3— found Halvorson again, this time streaking down the far sideline en route to a 45-yard touchdown.
It soon became apparent that just as one could watch a tennis player’s spouse during a US Open match to gauge his or her performance without ever looking at the court, one could just as easily have listened to the URI coaches’ bellowing to discern the ebb and flow of the game.
But the most telling moment wasn’t when my laptop was literally vibrating from the banging of fists one room over. It happened in the final seven minutes of the game. As the clock ticked down, if you hadn’t heard the ruckus for the past two hours, you might not have known anyone was in the room until the door opened and the coaches jumped over me to head down to the locker room.
The Crimson’s backup quarterback, Jimmy Meyer, on his first-ever collegiate pass, hit rookie receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley on a fly route. In his first-ever collegiate catch, Shelton-Mosley danced into the end zone, giving the visitors the 41-10 advantage, effectively de-horning any Rams attempt at a comeback. The silence was almost more deafening than the long string of curse words let loose after a blocked URI punt was returned for a touchdown—a sign of surefire surrender.
And yet, despite the lopsided score that hung over the field when Meyer took a knee to end the game, I can’t help but think that whoever was sitting on the other end of press row probably got an earful as well.
Of course, a 41-10 showing appears on the surface to be the sort of domination expected from a team undefeated last year that returns the majority of its starters. But the 31-point trouncing is a bit misleading—the game was very much in contention until the final quarter, a surprisingly tough battle for the first three quarters given URI’s past mediocre performances and the expectations set for this year’s Crimson squad.
Hosch looked sharp out of the gates, completing his first five passes, and the box score makes the senior’s day appear mighty impressive, as he ended the day with over 300 yards passing, three scores and just one pick—good enough to take home the Ivy League’s Offensive Player of the Week.
However, with an offensive line that gave him years to throw and six starts under his belt, Hosch underperformed in my eyes. The stat sheet doesn’t capture the fingertip catches Harvard receivers were forced to make when the ball was thrown just a little too high or far, or passes that sailed out of the reach of wide-open receivers.
And for a defense that prides itself on stopping the run, Harvard’s inexperienced defensive line gave up 95 yards to Rams back Harold Cooper—the same guy who had a grand total of -1 yards two weeks prior against Syracuse. Tack on a missed PAT, and you have to wonder if the minor missteps are indicative of the Crimson simply shaking off preseason rust, or of more deeply rooted issues that, innocuous against a team that won just one game last year, will hurt when Harvard takes on league powerhouses near the end of the season.
In the postgame press conference, captain Matt Koran recognized the necessity for the team to return to “fundamentals” this week in practice. Against Brown—a more formidable foe than URI—the Crimson will need to do so and clean up play on both sides of the ball if it hopes to silence the Bears’ coordinators in the Harvard Stadium press box on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the fourth time in five games, the Harvard women’s soccer team was unable to find the back of the net. However, the team points to an uptick in offensive attack as a bright spot as it heads into Ivy play.
Providence freshman forward Casey Estey willed the Friars to a 1-0 win over the Crimson (2-6-1) on Tuesday night at Jordan Field. After coming off the bench, Estey scored the game’s only goal of of a pass dished by senior forward Kathryn Hiller. Estey was the focal point of a Providence (7-3-0) attack that spent much of the game in the Crimson zone.
Harvard was able to generate more scoring chances than in Sunday’s loss at Massachusetts, but still found itself shut out.
“I definitely think this was our best effort thus far,” junior forward Karly Zlatic said. “We put it all out there on the line and I think that really showed. It’s really good going into Ivy League play. We’ve just got to get the goals in the back of the net and we’ll be ready to go.”
A pass from senior forward Kathryn Hiller gave Estey a breakaway in the game’s 48th minute. The Harvard defense gave chase but the first-year lifted it over Harvard freshman goalkeeper Danielle Etzel to give the Friars the only score they would need.
It was the second collegiate goal for the Kensington, N.H. native, who had five shots on the night and generated scoring chances for a Providence offense that had 14 shots for the game.
Etzel was one of several Crimson reserves who saw major minutes for Harvard in what was both teams’ final tuneup before their respective conference schedules begin this weekend. Freshman midfielder Zayne Matulis, sophomore midfielder Caroline Chagares, and sophomore forward Gabby Kaplan each started the game and logged at least 50 minutes of action.
Junior forward Midge Purce, the team’s leading scorer, and senior defender Alika Keene did not play for the Crimson. 22 of the 27 players on the Harvard roster saw action in Tuesday’s game, by far the most players the Crimson has used in a game this season.
The six losses are the most a Harvard team has had to open up Ivy League play since 2006.
“It is definitely different going in with our record being the way it is, but I think that just gives us an edge on every other team and we’ll be ready to go,” Zlatic said.
While the Crimson managed only one shot on goal-a save on a Rachel Garcia shot-Harvard took 13 shots and had six corner kicks on the evening. The team has only scored five goals this season, including just three in its four home contests. Garcia led Harvard with three shots while Kaplan and Zlatic had two apiece.
“We have to score goals,” junior co-captain Carly Rotatori said. “A lot of teams have really strong offenses, really strong defenses, but I think the biggest thing for us is to focus on is the things we can do personally.”
Despite the Friars’ 14 shots and seven corner kicks, the Crimson defense was able to limit Providence to only six shots on goal. Junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack made three first half saves before being replaced at halftime by Etzel.
Rotatori and sophomore midfielder Dani Stollar helped stabilize the defense in the second half while Stollar also helped lead Harvard offensive rushes.
“I think we came out really hard, played really well for the first half,” Rotatori said. “For the second half, we had a lot of scoring opportunities. I think the positive is we played really well, we reached a really high potential. This game showed we can really work hard and get scoring opportunities to win.”
The Friars’ defensive core of junior goalkeeper Kristyn Shea and defenders Hailee Duserick, Allison Mills, and Catherine Zimmerman played all 90 minutes.
Tuesday marked the third time Providence has defeated the Crimson all-time and the first time since 1990.
“I definitely think this will give us a strong backbone coming off such a hard couple of games,” Rotatori said. “We now know how to fight to the last minute, have an endurance in tough situations, being able to fight back when you’re down a goal.”
Harvard faces its first Ancient Eight opponent when it faces Penn on Sept. 26th at home. Led by a pair of goals from Purce, the Crimson defeated the Quakers last season, 3-0.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in 12 years, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team will open a season as the coaches’ choice to top the conference.
With nine of 12 first-place votes, the Crimson led the ECAC Hockey coaches’ preseason poll and placed third in the media poll, according to conference press releases Tuesday.
Whitney Avenue rivals Yale and Quinnipiac placed 1-2 in the media poll with 10 first-place votes each to Harvard’s nine. Crimson co-captain Jimmy Vesey led the preseason first team after topping the nation in goals in 2014-2015.
Harvard last topped the coaches’ poll before the 2003-2004 season, when the program won its seventh of nine conference tournament titles.
Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91, fresh off his first career preseason endorsement from his peers, addressed reporters via teleconference Tuesday morning.
“There’s a certain level of excitement from within the group, with a good amount of returners from last year’s team,” Donato said. “I think there’s a lot of optimism. I think we should be a pretty dangerous team up front.”
Harvard returns players responsible for 106 of the 121 goals the team scored in 2014-2015. Among those goal-scorers will be fifth-year senior Colin Blackwell. Under Harvard guidelines, the North Andover, Mass., forward will be eligible to play for at least one semester.
“It looks good for Colin,” Donato said. “We’re excited to have him back…. He certainly was a shot in the arm for us when he was healthy at the end of the season, and it is exciting moving forward to have a healthy Colin Blackwell around.”
According to Blackwell, he is still waiting to learn whether he will have a second full semester of eligibility. If he does not receive eligibility for the full year, he suggested he would choose to play in the spring semester, when the final stretch of the regular season and any potential playoff contests would take place.
“I’m excited to be back for another year; [it’s] just a question as to when that year would start,” Blackwell wrote in a message on Tuesday.
While Harvard will bring established offensive firepower into opening night, the Crimson will have to answer for inexperience in goal and on defense.
In the coming weeks, Donato will assess the team’s ambiguous goaltending situation, which involves three first-string candidates—freshman Michael Lackey, sophomore Merrick Madsen, and senior Peter Traber—with a combined one NCAA start over the last two seasons.
“I think it’s certainly an area of concern,” Donato said. “Anytime you’re talking...about the game of hockey, you’re talking about the goaltending being an enormous part of the equation, but I’m also an optimist in the sense that we have the type of talent that can give us great goaltending. I think there’ll be some great competition.”
Moving up the rink, Harvard loses two leaders on defense in Pat McNally ’15 and Max Everson ’15-16, who have signed professional contracts in recent months.
“Those are two important players for us to try to replace,” Donato said. “It remains to be seen. We certainly have some experience returning in guys like Desmond Bergin and Brayden Jaw and Wiley Sherman and Clay Anderson, but I do think we’re going to have to really improve and develop as the year goes on on the back line if we want to have a lot of success at the end of the season.”
Up front, Harvard’s first line of Vesey, co-captain Kyle Criscuolo, and junior Alex Kerfoot will return along with eight of the nine other Harvard forwards who skated during the ECAC Hockey final last March. Added to the offensive mix will be Boston Bruins second-round draft pick Ryan Donato—Coach Donato’s eldest son.
“I think for a long time I didn’t really consider much the idea of coaching him as much as I was excited about him getting a chance to start his education at Harvard,” the elder Donato said. “It will be an interesting chance. He certainly has some offensive tools that will fit in nicely to our group, but like most freshmen, he still has a lot to learn. So it should be interesting; it should make for some quality dinner discussions I’m sure.”
