Mike Huckabee is the former governor of Arkansas and the current host of “HUCKABEE” on the Fox News Channel. In 2008, he ran in the United States Republican presidential primaries; he is currently considering a run in the 2016 presidential election. Huckabee, who is a 2014 IOP Visiting Fellow, spoke at the JFK Jr. Forum on April 14. FM sat down with Huckabee to talk to him about same-sex marriage, higher education, and the 2016 race.
 
FM: In December you told Fox News you were 50–50 on [running for president in] 2016, and I know that you’re not announcing yet until after the midterm elections in November, but if you were to pinpoint another percentage on that, would you still say you were 50–50?
Mike Huckabee: Oh, I wouldn’t even attempt to put a percentage on it. I’m just very open to it, and I’m assessing whether or not there is a viable pathway through the primary.
 
FM: Referring to your speech last week in Iowa...there’s current developing trends that youth are becoming more in favor of marriage equality and your views are separate from that. With youth becoming more and more of the voting percentage, how do you and other conservative politicians [who want] to win the votes of youth [balance that] with keeping your stance on controversial topics that you know they will disagree with?
MH: I’ve found that most voters are mature enough that they’d rather you be honest, genuine, and authentic than for you to just take a position because they know that that’s what the audience wants to hear. The position that I hold is the same one that Barack Obama held, same one Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden held in 2008, and until 2012 Barack Obama continued to hold that position. What I would remind people of is it wasn’t just that he held that position, that he held that for the exact same reason that I do. He said ‘because I’m a Christian and because I think the biblical model is for man-woman marriage.’ That’s what he said in 2008 at the Saddleback Church, in that forum, so my question would be, is there any other option other than he wasn’t being honest and he’s not being honest now or somehow the bible got rewritten between 2008 and 2012 and someone forgot to tell a bunch of us? How does a person continually move on an issue like that when he bases it on a biblical record and on a faith norm, and then completely change it without explanation? I hold a position that I’ve held and hold it because of those convictions. I realize it’s not the position that a lot of other people hold. I don’t have any animosity from people who differ with me. I think that’s what makes America a great place and a great country.
 
FM: There’s a lot of news about Hillary [Clinton potentially running for president in 2016] but no one’s really sure who’s emerging from [the Democrats]. Can you pick out a name of who you think, from the Democratic side, would give the republican ticket the most trouble in the upcoming election?
MH: I think Hillary would be a very formidable candidate because she has such a strong base of support. There would be a lot of people who would want to support her because it would be an opportunity to do something historic with the first female president, and she’s certainly skilled and capable as a candidate and I think that would make it a very tough hill to climb, but not insurmountable. And probably of anyone that might run on the Republican side, my guess is I probably know the Clintons better than anybody else, so it wouldn’t be that big of a disadvantage for me.
 
FM: Do you think the Republicans when they’re deciding who will emerge as the frontrunner will take into account where Hillary stands?
MH: Probably not, the Republicans aren’t that smart. The Republicans probably will have the normal demolition derby and whoever’s left standing will be the nominee. I don’t think they’ll be thoughtful enough to think about those issues, but maybe we should.
 
FM: You were educated at two Baptist universities with religious affiliations. A lot of other head politicians these days—Barack Obama, Ted Cruz—have Ivy League degrees and are able to use those in their campaigning as another resume booster of why they’re qualified. What role does higher education play in running for political positions?
MH: I think it’s an important part of one's background and story. I don’t feel like I had a diminished education because of where I went. I’ve run against several Harvard graduates in my political career, I’ve beat all of them at the state level. I’ve debated them, I felt equal to the task, and never thought I was bested. I respect people who go to Ivy League schools but I don’t somehow believe that that alone is tantamount to necessarily be superior preparation to serving in public. I ultimately think that serving in a public office is not so much about what you know, but it’s about what you are willing to do. There’s a great phrase that I believe very strongly. It’s one that says ‘People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.’ I think that’s really how one approaches politics. Ronald Reagan went to a small, independent school, and he turned out okay. While education is vital, where one gets it is of less consequence than if one understands that the purpose of college is not to give all the skills you need, it’s to teach you how to learn, and you spend the rest of your life always in school, always learning, never coming to the place where you think you know it all.

Current Harvard students responded with a lack of concern when reflecting on how the newly announced SAT changes would have affected their test performance, had the College Board implemented them before they took the test.
The College Board announced its plans in early March to make sweeping changes to the SAT starting in the fall 2016.
Past SAT test-takers at Harvard generally agree they would have scored higher on the new SAT.
“I would have done better,” Madhavi L. Narayanan '17 said. “The vocab was what I struggled with the most, and the writing I think would’ve suited me more.”
The College Board has announced it would replace the vocabulary words tested on the Critical Reading section with words more likely to be used in college courses. Many SAT critics had previously claimed that words the test uses are antiquated and lacked relevance.
The College Board has also decided to remove the writing section entirely, lowering the maximum score to 1600 once more. The essay will become optional, and although the source passage will continue to change with each essay, the prompt will stay the same from test to test.
Narayanan explained that when she took the SAT, she felt that the original essay did not accurately reflect her high school coursework or her writing abilities. She also struggled with the vagueness of the prompt.
Thomas R. Jiang ‘17, who currently tutors high school students for the SAT test, says that he also believes he would have done better given these changes.
“There are fewer areas to make mistakes. It’ll be less of a marathon,” he said.
Jiang added that he thinks the SAT can only be improved by these changes. Both he and Narayanan, however, are less happy about the removal of the rest of the Writing section.
“It was good in the way that everybody had to study for it…I felt like I could work on it. But the essay—I didn’t know what they were looking for,” Narayanan said, as she explained why she approves of the multiple choice portion of the Writing section but not the essay.
Jiang agreed. He said that as an SAT tutor, the Writing section questions tested grammar in a way that made it easy for teachers and tutors to prepare students for that particular portion of the exam. Tutors will now have to alter their strategy to the new SAT format.
However, Jiang  said that he believes that despite these changes, there will still be strategies that students who wish to perform well on the SAT can learn.
“The SAT at the end of the day will still be super standardized,” Jiang said. “There will always be tricks to doing well on the SAT.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a week left until the end of elections for the Harvard Coop’s board of directors on April 24, candidates and Coop management remain uncertain whether enough members will ultimately vote in the elections.
The Coop’s election bylaws dictate that a minimum of 5 percent of the about 17,000 registered Coop members, which includes both students at Harvard and MIT, must vote in an election for it to be considered valid. Though this year’s election votes have not yet met that threshold, the current lack of voter participation isn not unfamiliar, according to the Coop General Manager Allan E. Powell.
“It’s always hard to get people to actually vote,” Powell said. “I look to see whether we’re reaching the 5-percent threshold, and I prod candidates to go out and get more votes.”
While Powell said he is concerned about meeting the threshold by the end of election cycle, he noted that he has never seen an election that failed to garner the minimum number of votes.
“At this point, we’re 60 percent plus right now,” Powell said, meaning that roughly 3 percent of eligible voters have cast a ballot. “I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll reach that number.”
Current members of the Coop Board said that, at this point, it really is up to the election candidates to get out the vote.
“We think it’ll be fine,” Cody R. Dean '14, a current member of the board of directors, said. “It’s really in the candidates’ hands.”
Hunter S. Fortney ’15, a candidate in the election, agreed with Dean but added that a low voter turnout might point to a low interest in Coop administration.
However, Monika A. Lutz, a student at the Harvard Extension School who is running for reelection to the Coop Board, said the Coop plays an important role in giving back to the student community each year.
“If you care about that service, if you care about ability to have things delivered, how the Coop involves itself in our lives for club funding, you have to vote for someone who is passionate and has your intentions at heart,” Lutz said.
Lutz also said that students should care about the Coop’s finances because it donates about $80,000 a year to student groups.
“If students don’t care who they’re putting on the board, that’s the outcome they’re going to get,” Lutz said.
Powell also discussed the continued importance of the Coop to students, as well as the current obstacles that management faces.
“The challenge is to try to find out what products and services the Coop can provide—what would make it relevant,” Powell said. “It’s why we try to tap in through student reps. They know what is going on on campus, what are hot trends, and how we can tailor the future to that information.”
As the end of the election draws closer, Powell noted that there are backup plans available if the total number of votes in the election fails to reach the 5-percent minimum. One option is to extend the deadline of the voting period, according to Powell.
Otherwise, Powell said a committee on nominations and governance would be formed to validate the election results, regardless of the bylaws.
“The committee would have to set up some sort of mechanism that would say they would set [the bylaws] aside and accept the voting as valid,” Powell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 5, 2013 at 12:00 a.m.
Last month, Harvard Legal Aid Bureau student attorney Carolina Kupferman ’11 secured a $250,000 judgement for her client in a divorce case. Kupferman was the first in her class of second-year law students to take a case to trial after joining the bureau last fall.
Jean Strout, who was a third-year student at the time, also contributed to the case as a co-cousel and mentor.
The judgment awarded the client 60 percent of her ex-husband’s 401(k) from their marriage, 50 percent of the money from their joint bank account, 50 percent of the equity from their house, and what Kupferman called a favorable visitation arrangement. The decision on the case was received last month, after two days of trial last fall and a nearly three-month wait for the judge’s decision.
Kupferman’s client, who allegedly suffered two decades of physical and psychological abuse at the hands of her husband before walking away from her marriage, was left with little to her name and two children to take care of. Quickly after she left, she said her husband moved thousands of dollars from their joint bank account and transferred the deed of their house to his mother’s trust, calling her claim to a piece of the house into question.
Kupferman was assigned the case in the fall, after it was handled by a student who recently graduated. After only a few weeks at the bureau, the case received a trial date and Kupferman found herself before a judge in October.
“I didn’t really know what I was doing,” said Kupferman, who added that she was anxious to argue against a professional attorney who had been practicing family law for some time.
However, Stephanie E. Goldenhersh, a senior clinical instructor at the bureau who advised Kupferman, praised the law student for her preparation and commitment.
“She certainly was up to the task,” Goldenhersh said, adding that Kupferman spent many late nights poring over the case and preparing for the trial. “We built trial notebooks, we discussed strategy, we reviewed documents for the court, we spent hours with the client.”
“For all other classes, if you don’t give enough time you’re hurting yourself...but the whole time you know you’re not doing this for you, you’re doing it for the client,” Kupferman said.
Recently, Kupferman and her legal team received notice of an appeal, but Kupferman has vowed to fight it on behalf of her client. Additionally, Kupferman is in the process of filing documents to push the client’s ex-husband to pay the judgment, which he has failed to do thus far.
The Harvard Legal Aid Bureau is a volunteer organization made up of Law School students who offer free legal services to low-income individuals under the guidance of clinical instructors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Phrases like “I see dead people” are embedded deeply in cultural imagination by now, but the “you’re seeing things” premise is getting a little old in horror. The ghosts almost always turn out to be real, and even if they’re not, the illusion is nearly always limited to them. But in Mike Flanagan’s new film, “Oculus,” the illusion is all around you. You can no more trust the reality of the ghosts than that of a shattered bowl or an apple.


 
“Oculus” straddles the childhood and adult experiences of Kaylie (Karen Gillan) and Tim (Brenton Thwaites) with an antique, sinister mirror called the Lasser Glass. Recently released from the mental institution where he has spent the better part of his youth, Tom struggles to understand the role that the mirror played in his father’s grisly murder of his mother years ago. When Kaylie recruits him to help her document the mirror’s supernatural powers on camera, the siblings must come to grips with the reality that memory and technology may be no match for the glass.
 
Despite its ultimately predictable plotline, “Oculus” intelligently engages with the intersection of sight and technology as a fresh contribution to the horror genre. Considering its place in a genre that is experiencing a booming renaissance, “Oculus” is a standout mainly thanks to its sheer originality.
 
One of the film’s best accomplishments is its technique of overlapping flashbacks with contemporary action. Notoriously hard to get away with, the combination of flashbacks with the present are fluidly presented in this film. It seems clear that Flanagan and his writing partner, Jeff Howard, took the idea of a sibling rematch against their ghosts and pushed it further in the best way, cleverly making the most of the overlap between the children and their adult selves.
 
Even the film’s brief flashes of horrific images are ones we haven’t seen before—granted, it is clearly drawing on conventions set down by films like “Psycho,” but the attention paid to sights and sounds, light and space, indicates a fresh look at tropes of which there has been little retooling.
 
It is this kind of sharp reinvention that defines the triumph of “Oculus”—it is indeed hard to believe that Flanagan can display such a rich awareness of the genre while simultaneously kneading it into new shapes and patterns.
 
But the film’s particular success lies in its firm grasp on the intersection of vision, cameras, and reflections. For Kaylie, cameras are both a perfect tool for documentation and a means by which to check one’s sense of reality and illusion. But as the power of sight becomes increasingly destabilized over the course of the film, so too does technology, and one’s reflection, like a camera image, is transformed into a three-dimensional space with depth.
 
Unfortunately, the ultimate impact of this originality is stunted by uninspiring performances from the film’s co-stars, Gillan and Thwaites, whose unconvincing delivery of great lines make the bad ones noticeable—though to be fair, it’s hard to redeem “It wasn’t me! It was the mirror!” Thankfully, the performances of the children in the film surpass those of the actors playing them as adults, particularly that of Annalise Basso as young Kaylie.
 
Similarly unsatisfying is the vague, pervasive sense that had the writers, cinematographers, and the music department worked more synchronistically, the suspense to which the film aspires could have played out more convincingly. As writers, Flanagan and Howard effectively heighten situations with seemingly banal activities befitting the suburbs in which the film is set—a housewife scrubbing the floor, a dog barking, and children playing with fake guns, for instance—but without enough payoff on their own.
 
In the end, the film’s originality is also undermined by its predictability. That said, the unsettling circularity of its plot structure works in its favor and tempers the moments—though they are numerous—in which events seem extraneous to the story.
Without a doubt, “looks can be deceiving” is taken to an entirely new level in this film. In spite of a plot that at times seems to lag, its presentation of vision and sight as unreliable, especially in a genre that has overused the concept of faulty vision as it applies to ghosts and hallucinations, is refreshing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming-of-age films often feel worn-out and stereotypical. While the adolescent struggle to find purpose or make sense of the world is relatable, many films risk being unable to distinguish themselves from others in the genre, the result of being subjected to a predictable formula and overused themes. So when any production undertakes a such a project, the cast and crew must meet the challenge of finding a way to differentiate their work and tell a common story in a new manner—a challenge the Georgian drama “In Bloom” meets with masterly execution.
 
Eka Khizanishvili (Lika Babluani) and Natia Zaridze (Mariam Bokeria) are the adolescents of interest: 14-year-old best friends, the two live in Georgia during the early 1990s, a time of instability and violence after the Soviet Union’s collapse. Despite the intense backdrop, the two girls proceed through their lives normally, encountering bullies, strict teachers, family problems, and bittersweet love. This is not to say Georgia’s political and social affairs have no role in the story; in fact, their concealed yet threatening presence is what makes the film powerful and distinct.
 
Co-directors Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon Gross weave a layered story by juxtaposing the girls’ daily lives with larger issues. Snippets from the radio and television are interspersed throughout the film and serve as reminders of Georgia’s precarious situation. This violence manifests itself most explicitly for Eka and Natia in the gun that Natia receives from her love, Lado (Data Zakareishvili); passed around between the girls, the gun fulfills an unseen newscaster’s urging at the beginning of the film. “There have always been people in Georgia who are warriors,” the newscaster says, and people must acquire guns to protect themselves. Yet instead of acting as a tool against the country’s strife, the gun becomes more of a defense against the violence in Natia’s and Eka’s own lives. And while this choice might detract from the significance of historical events, the film’s strength as a coming-of-age story derives from this artistic decision. While neutral on the events causing social strife and pain for the characters, the film embraces the fact that more tangible, noticeable problems are what have the greatest impact.
 
Babluani and Bokeria shine compared to other actors within the film, though they are not without faults. The two young actresses lack nuance in exhibiting their emotions, and the deficiency does cause many crucial scenes to feel static and one-dimensional. Babluani’s Eka feels reduced to being mostly forlorn and confused, and Bokeria oftentimes seems stuck in a state of anger or defiance. In some way, the simplicity of their expression allows them to create a clear contrast between the innocent teens running across fields and sharing secrets and the adults they have to be. Yet at moments, the two lack chemistry with each other; during a brief spat in the middle of the film, the fight feels cold, devoid of any disappointment or conflict, leaving any friendship prior feeling fake.
 
Cinematography contributes to the low-key feel of the film. The color scheme is soft: greys, browns, and blues shade most of the girls’ surroundings, and even when red or green hues are introduced, they are darkened and muted. Additionally, the film lacks a score—rather than using an orchestral piece, the film fills silences through the chirps of birds and shouts of the adults, a reminder of the personal conflicts occurring around the protagonists. When music does enter the film, it is in the context of the plot; a wedding scene is replete with a joyful melody and a gathering of girls is accompanied by Natia playing the piano. The result is a product that feels both grave and realistic.
 
Nevertheless, the film’s script does not free itself from traditional plot progression. The story follows a trend that, though different from films set in a less turbulent environment, is predictable. The climactic event that spurs Eka and Natia to reach their final growth might not be what the audience expects, but when it does arrive, it comes without shock. Some plot turns do feel surprising, such as parts of Natia’s love life, but this is a result of the film’s context. Set in a country dealing with social issues inconceivable in modern America, such as early marriages, the film provides moments when those cultural differences amaze. 
 
That is not to discount the film’s achievement. Muted but potent, “In Bloom” breaks past the constraints of coming-of-age stories to create something much more complicated. Poignant and exploratory, the drama becomes a creative exploration of a nation through the lens of two girls.

“I’m a railway enthusiast,” the young Eric Lomax (Jeremy Irvine) says. In most stories, the comment might be taken lightly. But “The Railway Man” is not a typical story. Instead, it is the true story of the struggles of a man in love with railways as he is captured by the Japanese and forced to help build the Burma Railway during World War II. It is the tale of his suffering from psychological trauma years later and it is an account of his attempts to find solace after locating the Japanese man behind his pain. As the film moves forward, the track taken is one both formidable and moving.
 
When the film begins, an older Lomax (Colin Firth) lying on the floor recites in a subdued, dead voice, “At the beginning of time, the clock struck one.” The camera trails from his feet to his face, a ghastly image when framed with the darkness and stream of light hitting his body. The introduction sets a reflective and philosophical tone, a tone carried throughout the film as Lomax tries to battle his inner demons from his war years.
 
Scene after scene, director Jonathan Teplitzky employs deft cinematography, integrating thoughtful visuals with a fitting soundtrack. The score reflects each moment’s mood, adding light to the romantic moments and darkness to any mention of the war. As Lomax’s wife, Patti (Nicole Kidman), researches his past and looks into images of the war in his notebooks, a steady drumbeat drives the tense moments forward until the low percussion becomes a high-pitched buzz, paralleling the sketches’ downward spiral from images of capture to those of torture. Visually, Teplitzky barrages the audience with a mix of muted and vibrant colors; in 1980s England, hues of grey, blue, and brown make up the color palate, a surprising contrast to the bright greens of 1930s World War II-era Thailand. Memory is more vivid than reality, a scenic suggestion that for the characters, the past overshadows the present.
 
But a beautiful backdrop is nothing without suitable actors, and “The Railway Man” delivers in that regard. Firth, acclaimed for his roles as a depressed university professor in “A Single Man” and King George VI in “The King’s Speech,” proves once again his ability to portray with a masterful realism characters afflicted by complicated conflicts. As the older Lomax, Firth must deftly show a man near breaking point, too caught in internal suffering, trying to maintain a complacent façade—something he accomplishes through careful changes in his face, large enough to be discerned but small enough to avoid seeming like caricatures. Firth’s control over his facial expressions is strong and communicative, and the camera’s regular pan onto his face allows the audience to slowly understand Lomax’s grief.
 
The most poignant performance, however, is Irvine’s as Firth’s younger counterpart. While Firth’s acting captures subtleties, Irvine is more explosive—fitting as the torture occurs in the present for him. During the most painful parts of Lomax’s time as a prisoner of war, Irvine’s dilated eyes capture all attention, a blankness within them that seems to suggest Lomax’s weakening resolve. These minute details grant Lomax’s depiction emotional weight, and the acting becomes another testament to how the film foregoes flash for something more innately human.
 
The only glaring issue with “The Railway Man” is its treatment of the story. While a majority of the film transitions fluidly between key scenes and different time periods, certain turns in the script feel sharp. Lomax’s romance with Patti at the beginning is meant to be sweet: “I’ve never kissed a man with a mustache before, and I won’t do it again,” Patti says to the then-mustachioed Lomax, and while the remark might sound contrived done wrong, Kidman delivers it so earnestly that it is more charming than laughable. Yet following the haunting, macabre first scene, these warm exchanges instead leave one cold. Such discordances disorient the viewer and detract from the film’s tone until even a striking, memorable denouement seems jarringly foreign against the rest of the film’s development.
 
Any peculiar moments, however, are redeemed by the film’s stunningly nuanced execution. It is raw acting and thoughtful visuals that propel the story to a resolution of heartbreak and enlightenment, that make a predictable ending still powerful, and that ultimately transform “The Railway Man” into an epic adaptation of a true story.

Massachusetts schools are embarking on a two-year trial run of an online K-12 testing system that could replace the current MCAS. In the past few weeks, more than 1,000 schools have tried out the Partnership for the Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers—the replacement test—with each school typically testing a couple of classrooms. While many commentators have hailed the PARCC as the natural next step in the merging of technology and education, others worry about the potential for socioeconomic disparities to be exacerbated by unequal access to technology. Those reactions are not mutually exclusive. Online testing is certainly the right direction for education, but it is important to compensate for socioeconomic gaps by funding schools that need the infrastructure.
 
The benefits of shifting to online testing are clear: superior illustrations for math questions, instantaneous—and less falsifiable—grading, the ability to monitor the exam’s progress in real time from a laptop, and more. Technology is particularly suited to standardized testing, and Massachusetts has the right idea in moving in this direction.
 
The introduction of the online PARCC to the high-stakes world of standardized testing is not without its pitfalls, however. Schools in lower income neighborhoods may not have enough computers to facilitate more than a few classrooms taking the exam at a time. Coupled with the new two-hour time limit, disparity in Internet speed and access to broadband could have serious consequences. Furthermore, students who use laptops or tablets in classes every day could have an edge over students who frequent a computer lab once a week. Schools may soon be choosing between investing in a math teacher and investing in a test-taking computer.
 
In order to ease the transition to the PARCC, Massachusetts should compensate for socioeconomic gaps by funding purchases of necessary technology and Internet access by schools that lack the necessary infrastructure. As we move forward in integrating technology with education, we must ensure that students of all income levels have the same opportunity to succeed.
 The stakes are high. In Massachusetts, students must pass state standardized tests to graduate from high school, and school performance on the MCAS can determine which schools are subject to overhauls and possible state takeovers. Given the importance of standardized testing in determining the fates of students and even schools, differences in access to technology cannot be allowed to impede the performance of students and schools.

More than usual, these past few weeks in the United States have been a time of sheer idiocy. A woman tried to throw a shoe at former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Some moron placed a fake bomb at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Bubba Watson ate at a Waffle House. But the pièce-de-résistance of this festival of stupidity must have been Twitter user @QueenDemetriax_’s contribution. On Sunday morning she tweeted the following to the American Airlines corporate account:
 


 
Within minutes, the company responded:
 


 
Despite her frantic claims that she was “kidding,” Dutch officials showed up at the Rotterdam native’s house and arrested her on the spot, drawing to a close a news story that would have been completely fruitless had it not provided me a topic to write about. For that, you and I both have @QueenDemetriax_’s unreliable frontal lobe to thank.
 
What this narrative seems to highlight however is not merely one girl’s lapse in judgment (especially considering dozens of teenagers followed her lead), but a larger phenomenon in which Internet users fail to associate their online actions with real-world consequences. Senseless and shortsighted uses of the Internet have led to unemployment, pedophilia, robberies, political scandals, and arrests.
 
Back when my family didn’t take trips without me, I always used to tease my dad for telling my siblings and I not to post pictures on vacation because “you don’t know who’s going to see that we aren’t at home.” You were right, and I’m sorry (this realization has become a trend now that I’m in college). But how else was I going to score my remarkable nine Instagram likes?
 
Older generations have always entertained a slight distrust of new technologies, fearing the limits of their privacy. And their kids have always gotten entertainment from that distrust. “No Grandpa, Gmail isn’t asking for your birthday so they can steal your pension.” “Yes, Mom, that’s a webcam. No, Mom, the government can’t watch you through it.” Although...
 
But all kidding aside, maybe more Internet users need figures like my dad reminding them that there is in fact a world that exists beyond the perimeters of their various screens. One of the defining characteristics of our generation is our increasing technological proficiency and ability to master new platforms so quickly. But we’ve grown so accustomed to computers and social media that the magnitude of our online actions is forgotten. Despite what some privacy settings may claim, anything posted online is available to anyone at any time.
 
The Internet allows some to believe they can cleanly divorce their online persona with their day-to-day life. In social media’s early days, such a split might have been feasible. But today everyone and his mother (including my own) is on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Vine (yep, she’s on all of them), and your account is merely an extension of your identity. “What I do online is my own business” or “It was only Twitter” no longer constitute valid excuses—to the public, your employer, your significant other, or anyone else. The novelty of these websites and applications has worn off, and for all intents and purposes, online postings are just as legitimate a form of communication as human interaction.
 
Academics who study human behavior and the brain are just now beginning to understand the cognitive impact of social media on its 1.73 billion users worldwide. Significant levels of Internet usage can lead to loneliness, jealousy, suicidality, and memory deficiency. But the most fundamental change wrought by the Internet is our unprecedented need for constant and immediate affirmation. I’ll be the first to admit, the number of likes I receive on a post has a direct impact on my mood in the short-run. After accumulating 18 favorites on some stupid tweet over winter break, I spent the rest of the day parading around my house like a king.
 
For those of you who dismiss the significance of this effect, I’ll leave you with this. What else could have possibly motivated @QueenDemetriax_ to hit the send button? Was she testing American Airlines’s security procedures? Is she actually the worst terrorist of all time? No, and I don’t think so. She hoped she could muster out a few favorites and maybe a retweet or two. Well @QueenDemetriax_, you got 10,000 of them, but they won’t do much for you in jail.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“The Democratic party just lost the South for the rest of my lifetime and possibly yours,” roars Brian Cranston as a grizzled Lyndon B. Johnson at soon-to-be vice president Hubert H. Humphrey in the Broadway production “All the Way.” 
“What the f— are you so happy about?” 
An expression of Johnson's unshakeable disquiet with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, these lines close out the first act of “All the Way,” and set the stage for Johnson's upcoming election. The play is excitingly reminiscent of both “House of Cards” and Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln.” Rife with political intrigue and backroom dealings, its first act focuses almost entirely on Johnson’s desire to reassure a distraught public that the “accidental president” is just as competent as his murdered predecessor by passing major legislation.
Lyndon Johnson and specifically the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have, not accidentally, recently become of significant public interest. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the bill’s passage, and the journalistic world has made a pet project out of comparing the legacies of President Johnson and President Obama. 
Many yearn in a dismally nostalgic way about how successful Washington used to be. How a strong, charismatic, slithering executive with ample experience could mobilize a significantly divided, but ultimately competent body. Congress was neither as obstinate nor as divided then as it is today, and thus deserves ample credit. But more often than not, praise is given mostly to the will and power of the executive, not the legislature: for the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the slew of other legislation passed during the Johnson administration.
There is little question that without Johnson’s prowess and familiarity with Washington wheeling and dealing such legislation wouldn’t have passed. But when it comes to comparing legacies, some argue that Obama’s lack of experience is overshadowed by the ineffectuality of Congress, and that something like the Civil Rights Act could never be passed today, even if Obama had Congress by the testicles (imagery Johnson apparently would have loved, according to “All the Way”).
It would be quite interesting from a historical and theoretical point of view to be able to see who really deserves the credit when loads of legislation are passed, but Washington today, which could provide a controlled experiment to find the answer, instead gives us the tools to be lazy and inconclusive just like itself.
Congress today is perpetually throwing a temper tantrum, and we also have a weak president—the worst of both worlds. If merely one of the bodies—executive or legislative—were inadequate, perhaps we could see whether much-needed legislation reaffirming the promise of the Voting Rights Act or making the National Security Agency more transparent could pass. But instead, we must scream and shout at both the president and the Congress while the former only slowly begins to resurrect the moral compass which guided him through his Senate and campaign years, and the latter sticks its fingers in its ears and votes in accordance with whomever fills its coffers the most.
We know we want change— it’s the same reason why we elected this president twice. But the question remains about which body will actually do it. 
I have very little faith in Congress’s ability to transform during the present administration. The body representing the moneyed class has an inexhaustible fuel supply and no incentive to change its course. Until a new generation of disenchanted and angry legislators emerges, riding on a populist anti-corruption wave, little will change. 
On the other hand, I do have possibly naive faith that the last two Obama years will finally see the emergence of a strong executive. Not one of the odd-machismo variety we have seen in the new millennium—one who maps out axes of evil, proclaims doctrines of intervention, and draws red lines—instead, one dedicated to progressive values, to the actual improvement of the health, longevity, and prosperity of its citizens. 
Perhaps Obama should take a page out of the Johnson playbook. At least then his conscience would be clear, and the overzealous evaluators could perform an accurate comparison of the two men, even if Obama’s legacy still would pale in comparison because of a childish legislative body. 
This past week the Obamas took some much-needed vacation time to see Denzel Washington in “A Raisin in the Sun.”  
Perhaps they chose the wrong play, perhaps they didn’t. Either way—there’s not a lot to be f—ing happy about.

What makes this breakfast different from all other breakfasts?
 
I am sitting here in the Mather dining hall, writing this piece over a hearty morning meal of matzo and cream cheese with a side of water, wondering, above all else, how to properly spell matzo in English.
 
For the uninitiated, this week is Passover, an eight day holiday in which your favorite local lawyers and doctors, the Jews, celebrate their exodus from Egypt by depriving themselves of everything remotely edible. When we fled Egypt, you see, we had no time to bake bread, and thus were forced to eat dough that had not risen, which conveniently turned into perfect rectangles that came fifteen to a box (although it should be noted that the box itself tastes substantially better than its contents, and is effectively made of the same ingredients). 
 
So here I sit, with so many thoughts swirling through my mind. Who first paired the matzo with the cream cheese, and what kind of prize did he win? What rabbi first decided that peanut butter was forbidden for the duration of the holiday, and how quickly was he fired? Why is there so little to eat outside of gefilte fish and horseradish? And where do the gefilte fish come from? And how did my great-grandparents in Poland find the coconuts to make their macaroons?
 
I know what you’re thinking: The dining halls serve gourmet matzo for breakfast! And bagels! Let me simply say, dear reader, no they do not. Just because the box says that the matzo is gourmet does not actually mean that anyone, including Chef Ramsay himself, could make anything remotely gourmet out of uncooked flour and water, regardless of the number of expletives thrown in for garnish. There aren’t even preservatives or carcinogens for added flavors! Also, the only part of the bagel I can eat this holiday is the hole in the middle.
 
And I’m left wondering why on earth there exists a religion which requires mandatory cracker consumption. I’m wondering why, unlike some of our peers, we don’t even bother to pretend that the cracker represents the body of a deity. I guess it seems just a little too sacrilegious to schmear Moses with Philadelphia cream cheese. I hope the man wasn’t lactose intolerant.
 
The first two nights of the holiday have elaborate meals, the central part of which traditionally involves your little cousins battling over who can throw their hard-boiled egg yolks into the other’s grape juice. After the yolk showdown, as well as a long, winding recitation of whatever motley collection of biblical verses and rabbinical wisdom Maxwell House assembled some years ago, the meal ensues.
 
This is no ordinary meal. Imagine an Iron Chef competition in which the secret ingredients are horseradish, parsley, and thousands of years of oppression distilled into a vinegar derivative called Manischewitz. Next remove all dairy and grain products from the kitchen. Now add your aforementioned cousins, who have nothing better to do than redistribute their yolk in the name of equality, which they learned from your uncle who kept interrupting the meal to talk about how awful Obama has been for him, and how he’s thinking of leaving the country and moving to Miami for tax purposes.
 
But I digress. The rest of the holiday is slightly less exciting, albeit equally difficult for the gastronomically challenged. I would be remiss to leave out how amazing Hillel has been, serving both lunch and dinner this holiday to help those of us struggling to get our fill of stuffed peppers and kugel. But the struggle hardly ends with dinner. Somewhere along the line, it was determined that beer is off limits, thanks to its barley or wheat content. Most vodka is a no go, too, leaving us with little more than plum brandy and Manischewitz. What a selection. Whoop de whoop. If the food carts outside the Science Center really wanted to make a killing this week, they’d be selling kosher-for-Passover rum and cokes. I’d tap that. With a straw. And maybe one of those little umbrellas. Once I turn 21, that is.
 
For those who couldn’t tell, I really miss bread right now. I’m sitting here overcome with jealousy as I watch everyone else enjoy their French toast and English muffins and Danish danishes. But there’s no turning back. If we built the pyramids we can surely survive for a week on crackers and cheese.
 
Perhaps with some horseradish on top.
 
Happy Passover.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two weeks after the Harvard softball team’s series with Princeton was interrupted because of rain, the Crimson finally closed out the Tigers on Thursday with a pair of victories. With these wins, Harvard (23-11, 9-0 Ivy) halted Princeton’s (14-22, 6-7) three-game win streak and maintained its undefeated record in the Ivy League.
It was certainly a wild couple of days for the Crimson. On Monday, the Ivy League told the team they would not travel to Princeton to make up the games. On Tuesday, the league reversed its decision. But the last-minute scheduling change did not throw off Harvard’s game.
Behind junior ace Laura Ricciardone’s fifth shutout of the season, the Crimson were able to pull off a 1-0 victory over the Tigers in the first game of the day.
The Harvard offense came to life in the second game with two home runs in the fifth inning to propel the Crimson past Princeton, 5-1.
“This team has proven that we are mentally tough in the face of adversity,” Ricciardone said. “Our focus is on controlling the controllables and playing Harvard softball every time we go out on the field.”
HARVARD 1, PRINCETON 0
Left in limbo for two weeks after rain suspended the Crimson’s opening game with the Tigers, the two teams resumed play in the bottom of the fourth inning.
After pitching three scoreless innings to begin the first contest two weeks ago, Ricciardone picked up right where she left off by retiring the first six batters she faced.
“We wanted to go out on defense and have quick three-up, three-down, to let the offense put some runs on the board,” Ricciardone said. “[We] started with an attack mindset pre-game that allowed us to execute.”
With two outs in the sixth inning, junior right fielder Andrea Del Conte and co-captain Kasey Lange advanced to second and third on a double steal. During the next at bat, Del Conte came home on an error by the catcher to score the lone run of the game.
“It was going to come down to one hit or one big play and we had [junior Katherine] Lantz up and we had great speed on the bases,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said.
This misstep was the only one of the night by Princeton sophomore Shanna Christian, who scattered eight hits and picked up eight strikeouts over the course of both parts of the suspended game.
The Tigers threatened in the bottom of the sixth with two runners on, but Ricciardone struck out junior catcher Cara Worden to end the inning. After two quick outs in Princeton’s final inning, the Tigers again rallied to put the tying run on second and the winning run on first.
However, Ricciardone ended Princeton’s hopes in the same fashion as she did the sixth with an inning-ending strikeout to preserve a one-run Crimson lead and complete the shutout.
HARVARD 5, PRINCETON 1
After scoring only two runs through its first 11 innings against the Tigers, the Crimson broke out in the fifth inning with home runs from Lange and Ricciardone to take its first lead of the game.
Ricciardone continued to stifle Princeton’s offense in the second game of the afternoon, recording five strikeouts in four innings of work. However, the senior’s scoreless streak ended in the third inning when the Tigers pushed across a run to take a 1-0 lead.
Harvard immediately responded in the top of the fourth inning. After Ricciardone walked, sophomore pinch runner Zoe Galindo came into the game and stole second to move into scoring position. An RBI single off the bat of freshman left fielder Catherine Callaway scored Galindo to make the game even at one.
Once again, stealing bases proved critical to setting up scoring opportunities for the Crimson.
“We’ve been able to utilize our speed at different times and it’s come through for us,” Allard said.
The Crimson offense switched from small ball to the long ball in the fifth. After a leadoff single by co-captain Shelbi Olson, Lange hit a two-run homer to right. Just two batters later, Riccardione added a home run of her own to give the Crimson a 4-1 lead.
The captain duo Olson and Lange struck again in the seventh. Olson stole second after reaching base on a fielding error by the shortstop, and later scored on a Lange single through the left side. Lange and Olson top the Crimson offense, hitting .375 and .347, good for first and second on the team, respectively. With her three runs batted in on the day, Lange extended her season total to 27, the second-highest in the Ivy League. Olson’s two stolen bases propelled her into the league lead, as she passed Yale senior Tori Balta with her 12th stolen base. Olson leads the team with 41 hits on the year.
Sophomore Morgan Groom and freshman Taylor Cabe held the Tigers offense to no runs through the final three innings to complete Harvard’s sweep and extend the team’s program-record winning streak to 14 games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a quiet Saturday afternoon two weeks ago, Harvard men’s volleyball closed out its home season against Saint Francis, winning in four sets. As senior Will Chambers hit the game-winning kill, the half-full crowd loudly cheered the team—which had clinched a third consecutive playoff bid—off the court. While it was a routine victory for the team, for the five seniors who had just played their final home game, it was the beginning of the end of their four-year journey. Every senior class is special in its own right, but the Crimson will graduate a truly exceptional group of players this year.
When the seniors arrived as bushy-eyed freshmen for the 2011 season, the program was in a very different state. Playing in the second tier of the EIVA, the team finished last in the conference, going 1-7 with its solitary conference win. In the final game of the 2011 season, Shaun Mansour ’11 was the lone senior honored—a far cry from the size of this year’s class.
The future was bright, though, as four of those freshmen started right from the start. Nick Madden started at middle blocker freshman year, but has since been the team’s go-to opposite hitter. Madden does a bit of everything for the squad, and does it all superbly. On all-time Harvard lists, he is second with 475 digs (despite not being a libero), third with 848 kills, fourth with 214 block assists, fifth with 234 total blocks and sixth with 59 service aces. Few players have the ability to impact as many areas of the game as Madden is able to week in and week out. His wide-ranging dominance has seen him rack up an impressive eight double-doubles for his career, including four this season as he has taken game to the next level.
While Madden may be second all-time for blocks, the number one spot belongs to his fellow co-captain. Chris Gibbons has spent his career as the team’s libero, the fulcrum around which the team pivots. His record of 778 digs for his career is miles ahead of his closest rival and speaks to the volume of quality performances the California native has put in over his four years. His single season record of 219 digs set last season is in danger of being broken again, as he sits at 205 heading into the playoffs. He has been a model of consistency on the squad throughout his tenure and the defensive focal point of the team for the last four years.
Fellow senior Kyle Rehkemper is a wiry 6’6” player who has spent his time as a blocking machine for Harvard. The middle blocker has similar career stats to Madden—199 block assists and 223 total blocks—despite being unable to play for the team his sophomore year. Who knows what Crimson records would have tumbled down had he been able to compete that year? Rehkemper was named to the All-EIVA second team as a junior, an honor that among the seniors he alone has been able to garner up to this point.
Michael Owen started out as a hitter but is now the team’s primary setter. Despite sharing a name with the diminutive national English hero who scored that goal (yeah, that one) against Argentina in the ’98 World Cup, this Owen stands at a formidable 6’7” and yet still has the agility to react swiftly, and the touch to set up the rest of the offense. Walk-on Will Chambers rounds out the class as a middle blocker. Though infrequently used, he has always been remarkably effective and will graduate as the Crimson’s leader on the career efficiency list, holding a career hitting average of .435.
On the back of the promise shown by this group in their first season together, Harvard was ranked fifteenth in the national preseason poll their sophomore year. The turnaround was dramatic: the team qualified for the EIVA playoffs as the second seed before a gut-wrenching playoff loss to George Mason in the semifinals.
The next year the Crimson moved up a notch to No. 14 in the preseason rankings and then went one step further, avenging last season’s defeat in winning a five-set thriller over George Mason to send them to the championship game against Penn State, who has dominated the EIVA landscape in winning the conference for the past 15 years. Despite Harvard splitting the regular season with the Nittany Lions that year, winning at home but losing away, in the championship it was no contest. Penn State ran away with the title in straight sets.
This year Harvard was ranked No. 13 in the preseason rankings. The natural progression has them taking that final step and winning the conference. After finishing second in the league, but losing all six sets it played against the Nittany Lions, this Crimson team finished the year on a three-match win streak. It is ready. It has been a win four years in the making. Now the Crimson is truly set to end the Penn State reign that stretches back to the last century.
Heading into the tournament, one absolutely should not discount what coach Brian Baise has done with the squad in bringing them to the level that they are at today. The Crimson simply would not have had the success it has had in the last four years without him at the helm. Nonetheless, Harvard owes an enormous debt to this senior class.
When the audience was cheering after the Saint Francis victory, it was not just congratulating the team and its seniors on a job well done. It was saying goodbye to a group that has redefined what opponents think when they look on the schedule and see the name “Harvard”.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 18, 2014, at 4:42 p.m.
In a recent study, Jodi Gilman, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, discovered brain abnormalities in young adults who are marijuana smokers. According to Gilman’s research, brain regions related to decision-making, motivation, and emotional processing in participants tended to be compromised.
In the study, which was published in the Journal of Neuroscience, findings revealed differences in the mind of young adult marijuana users, at an age when their brains were still developing.
Gilman and co-author Hans Breiter from Massachusetts General Hospital recruited 40 young adults from the Boston area ranging from 18 to 25 years old. Half of the participants smoked marijuana regularly—a minimum of one time per week—while the other half did not smoke at all. After conducting MRIs and comparing the size, shape, and density of different structures in the brain, the researchers found noteworthy differences in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala.
Gilman pointed out, however, that the study did not look for differences in the subjects’ behavior, and that more research should be done before determining the safety of marijuana use.
Nathan Greenslit, who teaches a History of Science course on “The Historical and Cultural Lives of Drugs in the U.S.,” agreed that while the study looked at changes in the brain’s physical structure, it did not necessarily indicate any changes in behavior.
“The study did not make any claims about how marijuana differently affected cognition or behavior in these groups. It literally just tried to establish that the aggregated brain images of the two groups look different,” Greenslit said.
Although it is commonly accepted that drugs affect the brain, this study is unique in that the participants were occasional users rather than long-term heavy users, Gilman said. Participant criteria dictated that they had to be “casual” users, who smoked at least once a week and showed no dependency or addiction on marijuana.
“The study in question basically invents two new categories of person: the young ‘casual’ marijuana user and the young non-marijuana user,” Greenslit said. “It’s an example of turning to brain imaging to make seemingly objective what we only care about in the first place because of a unique political history surrounding the criminalization of a plant."
Gilman said that the importance of the experiment lies in the age group of the participants, since young adults are making big decisions regarding their majors, careers, and relationships at this time of their lives.
"If the participants stopped using marijuana, we don't know if, let's say in a year, the abnormalities would normalize," Gilman said.
Gilman also admitted more research needs to be done in order to see how these brain abnormalities relate to behavior and to make larger claims.
"The marijuana used today is much stronger than what people used to see, and we don't know the effects," Gilman said. "We need to be cautious before we have the data."

CORRECTION: April 18, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the name of the journal in which Gilman's study was published. In fact, it was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

Zaheer Ali ’94, scholar and former vice president of the Harvard Islamic Society and the Black Students Association, spoke about the increasing influence of African American Muslims on American culture at a talk at the Barker Center Thursday evening.
The talk, sponsored by the Harvard Islamic Society, marked the beginning of the “Islam in America” series, which Lana A. Idris ’16, the director of internal relations for HIS, characterized as an “attempt to express our own Muslim American narrative.”
Following an introduction from Idris, Ali began his talk with a juxtaposition of the song “We Made It,” by Drake, and a remix of the song produced by Jay Z and Jay Electronica. He argued that while the original serves as “a celebration of consumerism and consumption,” the remix alludes to aspects of the Islamic religion, such as the shahada, a declaration of faith.
He then compared the changed message of the remixed song to the influence of Islam in America more broadly.
“African American Muslims have altered and remixed the meaning of American freedom and the story of America,” he said.
Ali presented the ways in which he said African American Muslims have remixed America across four categories: history, identity, justice, and spirituality.
He spoke about the connection between slavery in America and Islam, as many of the slaves brought to America were Muslim. Ali encouraged the audience to “rethink the meaning and story of that American history,” and also discussed the significance of the Nation of Islam in defining social justice.
Ali also took questions from the audience. When asked about ways to improve the quality of Muslim student life at Harvard, he advised students to work for parity across cultural groups in terms of access to resources and administrators.
“Do not be afraid to ask important questions,” he said, adding that it is “important for people to know that you are thinking about these issues.”
After the talk, HIS vice president Saheela O. Ibraheem ’15 said she appreciated the comparison that Ali drew between the adhan, the Muslim call to prayer, and slave work songs.
“Bringing up things like that I think was not only useful to non-Muslims, who aren’t African American, but also to African American Muslims who might not know about these stories, who may also want to look back into that history,” Ibraheem said.

Happy Friday! Congrats on surviving yet another week of second semester! With that, we’re just two weeks away from the start of reading period. If you’re absolutely done with the semester, congrats—you’ve almost made it. But if you’re like us, wide-eyed freshmen—or, the complete opposite, wise and nostalgic seniors, it’s almost unfathomable that the year is already over. For all of you, consider this your two week warning. You can figure out how to spend it.
Academically either...
A) overworking in all your classes to bring up those grades last minute
B) completely slacking off and actually doing none of your reading because screw it, you’re almost done. Plus finals will be the real decider in the end.
Socially either...
 A) sitting down next to random strangers in your dining hall as if it were the first days of freshman year all over again, trying to meet anyone and everyone you possibly can
 B) exclusively hanging out with your closest friends because let’s be real, how many of those other people will you speak to even once this summer?
Extracurricularly either...
 A) running for ALL THE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS FOR NEXT YEAR. All of them. You can handle it, it’s now or never, etc. etc. etc.
 B) randomly going to yoga classes. You’ve always wanted to.
Whether you’re more type A than type B, or (most likely) somewhere in between, we have full faith that you can make these last two weeks of classes the best ones yet (despite all the pre-finals stress). Start them off by having an absolutely phenomenal weekend, you’ve earned it!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a week after Shabazz Napier and the UConn “Hungry” Huskies took home the 2014 NCAA men’s basketball championship, prognosticators have already begun looking towards next season. For the third straight year, the Harvard men’s basketball team has made a selection of preseason lists. The Back Page has a list of what everyone is saying about Harvard so far this year.
The Crimson received the most love from NBC Sports, which ranked the Crimson No. 13 in its Way-Too-Early Preseason Top 25. Harvard came in just after Wichita State, which won its first 35 games of the 2013-2014 season, and ahead of Florida, which lost to UConn in the Final Four.
Although Harvard’s NBC Sports ranking corresponds to an NCAA Tournament four-seed, ESPN’s Joe Lunardi ranked Harvard as a 12-seed, which would be the third time in four years that Harvard has entered The Dance in that position. Lunardi projects Harvard to play Iowa State in Seattle, Wash.
Lunardi’s ranking is consistent with the Preseason Top 25 of ESPN colleague Eamonn Brennan, who ranked Harvard just outside his top 25 as one of the “15 teams that may crack the list at some point before November.” Brennan’s assessment was largely consistent with that of CBS Sports, which ranked Harvard as the 26th-best team in the country.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 18, 2014, at 12:51 p.m.
The Harvard Club of Ukraine is collaborating with the alumni organizations of other universities from across the U.S. and Europe to fill vacant positions in the interim Ukrainian government with Western-educated professionals.
The effort, which was announced in a joint statement to the Ukrainian Prime Minister and Cabinet that was released at the beginning of March, has gained support from 20 alumni and professional organizations within Ukraine, comprising over 1,500 members in total, according to a website established to allow government officials to solicit applications for vacancies.
According to Vasyl Myroshnychenko, who heads the London School of Economics Alumni Group in Ukraine, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Education and Science, and even the Secret Service of Ukraine (SBU), the main government security agency, among others, have already posted openings through the site.
After then-President of Ukraine Viktor F. Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties to Russia, a wave of civil unrest originating in Maidan, the central square of Kiev, the nation’s capital, resulted in Yanukovych’s removal from office and the creation of a new government under interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.
On the day that Yatsenyuk’s cabinet of ministers was formed, Nataliya Bugayova, a 2012 graduate of the Kennedy School of Government who now serves as  both an advisor and chief of staff to the Minister of Economic Development and Trade, contacted the chairman of the Harvard Club of Ukraine proposing the initiative.
“I told him that we need to come out strong and say that we’re ready to help pro-bono or full-time, it doesn’t matter,” she said. “If the government wouldn’t become professionalized now, than the window of opportunity will close and in a couple of years the same problems will remain. Our initiative is a continuation of Maidan, but in a different realm. It is a movement from the streets to the government.”
With widespread corruption and stagnation problems within the Ukrainian government before the revolution, Bugayova said that the progressive voice for social and political reforms was coming from the edges of the public sphere—that Western-educated individuals would more often hold management positions in business, non-governmental work, and the media than in the government.
Nevertheless, that voice was strong in pushing change in a variety of spheres across Ukraine, Bugayova said.
“The fact that we had many people studying in the United States and Europe and then coming back [to the Ukraine] was partly a reason for why Maidan happened,” she said. “There was this middle-class, educated, and Westernized population that wanted the change.”
As of April 7, the “Professional Government” Initiative, as the effort is called, has received 20 position submissions, according to Danyil Pasko, a 2010 graduate of Harvard Business School’s MBA program and chairman of the Harvard Club of Ukraine. About 250 people from the participating alumni organizations have applied for those vacancies.
While the effort, which Pasko said has been widely publicized on national television and print media, has generally been received positively by government leaders, position requests have been submitted at a fairly slow pace. In addition, he said, they have more often than not been for pro-bono advisors rather than for full-time, high-ranking posts.
“We’re not receiving the real positions, such as vice minister or head of department positions,” he said, noting that many of these positions were filled within a few days of the interim government’s creation. “I’m not sure that this is an indication of real interest. I’m not sure that [the advisor positions] are the positions which are game-changers and are positions in which our applicants can really make an impact.”
Nevertheless, say Bugayova, who advocates for one-third of departments within each Ukrainian ministry to be headed by Western-educated professionals, progress is being made.
“I don’t think there have been nearly enough requests, but the bottom line is that there are some new people coming in,” she said. “It all comes down to the critical mass, and whether there are enough people to change the course of action or whether they will just be absorbed or thrown out by the system.”
While Ukraine’s future may be largely unpredictable, given growing social unrest in Eastern parts of the country in addition to forthcoming presidential elections in May, the big picture is that a mobilizing unity has developed within the foundations of Ukrainian society, said Myroshnychenko.
“Every morning, when I go through Maidan, I see people who come from all over Ukraine bringing flowers to pay tribute to those who died,” he said. “But it’s more than that. People understand that they live in a different country. There’s a huge demand for change, and people have learned to organize themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Associate Anthropology professor Kimberly Theidon filed a charge against the University with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in late March, alleging that the University violated Title IX by denying her tenure in May 2013 for engaging in speech and conduct protected by federal anti-discrimination law.


Theidon, who holds the title of John J. Loeb Associate Professor of the Social Sciences—an endowed position—said that although she received indication that she was a strong candidate for tenure, she was ultimately denied a permanent professorship at the University. She alleges that the denial was in retaliation for her public expressions of support for sexual assault victims, as well as for complaining that she was not receiving the same pay as her male colleagues.
“This is about silencing a problem on this campus,” Theidon said in an interview Thursday. She said that she had advocated for sexual assault victims in a variety of ways, ranging from statements she made in the classroom, to private conversations with students, to comments she posted online.
Keith Healey of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination confirmed Thursday that the state administrative agency is actively investigating Theidon’s complaint to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that an act of discrimination occurred, in which case a fact-finding hearing would ultimately be convened. Unless Theidon moves the case to court or the parties resolve it by settlement, it could take over a year for the Commission to decide the issue, he added.
 
Theidon said that she hopes to see a conclusion in which Harvard “evaluate[s] its sexual assault prevention and response.” Theidon also said that she has appealed the University’s tenure decision. She provided excerpts of her MCAD charge to The Crimson, but declined to produce the full document. The University will have the opportunity to respond to her charges in a position statement, which has not yet been filed. 
 
Theidon alleges that the University’s decision to deny her tenure was influenced largely by comments she posted in March 2013 in response to a Crimson article about sexual assault at Harvard. There, Theidon defended the anonymous victims of sexual assault who were quoted in The Crimson, and argued against self-identified “men’s rights” activists commenting on the story.
 
Theidon said Thursday that before commenting on the article, she had learned that the women interviewed for it had read others’ comments arguing against their claims of sexual assault, leaving them feeling “violated all over again.”
 
In another case cited in the complaint, Theidon said that she provided counsel for a female student who alleged that a male faculty member had sexually harassed her. Theidon said she told that student to speak with the University Ombudsman. Later, Theidon alleged, the student informed her that she had been approached by two faculty members who instructed her to keep Theidon out of the proceedings because her involvement would threaten the associate professor’s future at Harvard.
 
Theidon’s filing with the MCAD alleges that members of her department “cautioned her that her tenure would be adversely affected if she became involved in any specific complaint.” She also claims that students were told to stop speaking with her about their sexual harassment because “her tenure process hung in the balance.”
Theidon said Thursday that after she was informed of the University’s tenure decision, her “stunned” department chair, Gary Urton, told her to consult with Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer.
In her meeting with Singer, Theidon said, she was told that her “political activity” had been discussed by the tenure committee, which had concluded that scholars generally refrain from such advocacy until after they receive tenure. Theidon said that though Singer did not specify, she is confident that, in the absence of other political activity, her advocacy on sexual assault was the activity in question.
Singer’s office deferred all inquiries on the matter to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal. Urton declined to comment for this story.
Although Theidon said that she believed her support of sexual assault victims is at the core of the University’s decision to deny her tenure, Neal told the Crimson Thursday that her alleged advocacy for students did not have any bearing on the matter.
“[T]he University would never consider a faculty member's advocacy for students who have experienced sexual assault when making a tenure decision,” Neal wrote in an email. “Instead, tenure decisions are based on the quality of a faculty member's research, teaching and University citizenship.”
 
Theidon entered the tenure track as an assistant professor in 2004 and was promoted on time to the rank of associate in 2008. In line with the University’s tenure track protocols, her current appointment at Harvard will expire at the end of the 2013-2014 academic year, on June 30, she said.
 
Theidon said that in her time on the tenure track, she repeatedly received indication that she was in a good position to receive promotion.
 
“There was never a moment when I was given anything other than positive indications about where I was headed at Harvard,” she said, pointing to her inclusion in the planning process for what were to be her faculty offices and several instances of praise for her work.
 
Ultimately, the University President chooses whether or not to grant a professor tenure, but the decision comes after a lengthy consideration process that progresses from the department level to a discussion within an ad hoc committee overseen by the president. 
Singer, who, according to Theidon, allegedly cited her political activity as a part of the committee’s reason for denying her tenure, ordinarily sits on this committee. For a candidate in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, other committee members include the FAS dean, the Provost of the University, the candidate’s divisional dean, and five professors in the candidate’s field of study.
Although the proceedings of their meetings are strictly confidential, according to the Handbook, committee members review a dossier of candidacy materials. The dossier contains a wide array of information that outlines the candidate’s publications, research, and teaching.
Theidon specializes in Latin American Studies, with a focus on the Andean Region. According to her curriculum vitae, Theidon has edited, written, or otherwise contributed to around 70 pieces of published work since 1995. Most of this work was done prior to her teaching appointment at Harvard in 2008. Since then, she has taught a dozen courses.
One of Theidon’s books, “Entre Prójimos,” inspired the 2009 Oscar nominated film “The Milk of Sorrow.”
Theidon’s complaint was filed just days before an anonymous op-ed in The Crimson describing the aftermath of a sexual assault reignited debate about the issue at Harvard. The issue has continued to dominate the news in recent weeks, as Faust announced the creation of a task force focused on the culture surrounding sexual assault on campus and, this week, that a revised sexual assault policy had been submitted to the Department of Education for review.

Sitting in the common room of Elliot A. Wilson ’15 and Sarah E. Coughlon ’15, I can’t help but feel as though I’m visiting the office of an eclectic English professor. I’m perched on the edge of the couch, surrounded by walls of shelves stacked with books and plays. I’m reminded that, though many Harvard students find themselves too busy to read for leisure, an affirming amount of the student population collects books and reads for fun, amassing some pretty exemplary bookshelves in the process.
 
Competitive Reading
 
“We should probably tell her about competitive reading,” Coughlon says to Wilson. It turns out the pair’s massive collection isn’t just a hobby—it’s a full-fledged rivalry. Both friends use the website Goodreads to track what they’ve read. Wilson explains, “I’d started in high school, and was mean to Sarah freshman year about her reading habits, and it just so happened that Goodreads instituted a Challenge Yourself book-reading competition, and so we ended up not only challenging ourselves, but each other. We both read 100 or more books [that] year.”
 
But what counts as “a book” for the competition? Coughlan explains, “The rule I had was that I can get away with reading a lot of short plays, or Elliot reads a bunch of children’s books, as long as I read, say, “Infinite Jest” in the same year.”  She points to a stack on her desk to show me that she has “a couple goals for the year”; I spy “The Principles of Psychology”, “the Qu’ran”, and some moral philosophy.  
 
Rather than going simply for volume, the pair also seek out book editions that are novel or interesting. “I think we’re tied for oldest printed book,” he says, indicating a copy of Cicero’s “Orations” from 1895, the same year of publication of Coughlan’s copy of “Silas Marner”. In fact, Wilson’s book collection started with retro book editions he “borrowed” during high school. He pulls a tattered copy of the “Iliad” from his shelf and shows me the inside cover. “This is a school ‘Iliad’ published in the mid-’20s that belonged to Helen R. Candle, 420 Riverside Drive. There’s even a little note that got passed to her about a class president election, and there’s a place where she burned the pages with a cigarette, like someone had her first smoke in high school in the ‘40s.”
 
The pair’s shelves aren’t covered with clutter like many student’s bookshelves, but each collector has a single shelf filled with wine glasses. Wilson jokes that the pair are “inverted Hemingways” who drink and read rather than write, but Coughlon ties her books and glasses to a different sort of lifestyle. “Pleasure reading is a thing that not enough people do,” she says, “and I find it to be an enormous source of joy and relaxation. Combining my book collection with not binge drinking, like sitting down with a nice glass of wine and reading, forces me to slow down and be deliberate about reading, like using non-solo-cups to drink slowly.”

The year is almost over, and if you are anything like me, your TF still thinks that your name is Rachel. You need to start making a good impression, and you need to do it quickly—before participation grades are due. The first step, you might assume, is to legally change your name, and it probably is, but if you’re concerned about making all of your monogrammed apparel useless, I’ve got some other solutions.
Skip Section
 
It might seem counter-intuitive, but some TFs only like what they can’t have. Stop showing up, and your TFs will think twice about taking you for granted.
 
Email Them
Change your Gmail settings to include an automatic signature with your name, your degree, and a fun fact from your resume (your proficiency in Microsoft Word, perhaps?). Then forward your TF all your emails. He will be impressed by your professionalism and pubbing skills. 
 
Work in Advance
Don’t ask for an extension at the last minute; ask for it now. Show that you had the foresight to plan ahead for that “ vague family emergency” two weeks from now that will prevent you from turning in your final paper on time. Plus, this will give you an excuse to email your TF and remind him who you are. 
 
Feed Your TF
Just like people, TFs need to eat to survive. So bribe them with food. Invite them to faculty dinner, or bring them an apple in section. Even better—provide homemade baked goods for the entire class. They’ll be so impressed by your generosity and culinary skills. 
 
Talk Loudly
The best way to prove that you have been participating all semester is to talk constantly during the last section. What you say doesn’t have to be relevant; it just has to be loud. Have a megaphone? Consider bringing it along.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—has approved the first university-wide policy on searches of electronic communication on the Harvard network, about a month after a task force led by Law School professor David J. Barron ’89 submitted a policy draft at the end of February.
Under the new policy, electronic searches must be authorized by “an appropriate and accountable person” and must serve “a legitimate and important University purpose.” The policy states that the individual authorizing a search must consider University values, “such as academic freedom and internal trust and confidence,” with the decision whether to search communications.
If the target of the search is a faculty member, the dean of the relevant school must authorize the search. If the subject is a student, the relevant dean or the dean’s designee must approve access.
The policy also stipulates that all searches are to be recorded and that a committee chaired by Law School professor John C. P. Goldberg will conduct periodic reviews of recorded searches. Finally, the new policy states that while the University must notify the target of a search in most situations, it is not required to do so if notification might compromise the effectiveness of the search.
Goldberg, who was a member of Barron’s task force and specializes in tort law, said that while the conception of the oversight committee is still in its early stages, he was “pretty confident” its role will be solidified by the next academic year.
“That’s going to have to be a conversation with the folks in Massachusetts Hall—what makes sense in terms of size and membership,” Goldberg said. “We’re all on the same page in terms of setting up the committee that will do the job it was appointed to do.”
The approval of the Corporation, which includes University President Drew G. Faust,  comes after Barron’s task force solicited feedback from a number of different Harvard constituencies. The task force estimated in its February report that, in total, it met with around 500 members of the University community, and Barron himself led two open forums on the policy last fall and addressed the November meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. After Barron submitted his draft to Faust in February, the policy was made available to the Harvard community on an online discussion board.
“We’re very pleased with how much the University community came together to think through this problem,” said Barron, who is a former Crimson president. “While on the one hand it came out of a particular controversy, we always thought the charge of the committee’s work was a policy that will be durable going forward.”
He added that the policy seems to have “gained the confidence of the community as a whole.”
Barron also noted that while most changes to the draft policy were minor, the ‘Internal Investigations of Misconduct’ subsection now includes a second explicit mention of the need to weigh University values “such as academic freedom and internal trust and confidence” before authorizing any searches in connection with an internal investigation of misconduct, previously only explicitly mentioned in the general ‘Reasons for Access’ section.
“This policy is an important response to a complex set of challenges,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “It reflects the values that underpin our work as an academic community—transparency, trust, and respect for academic freedom—and as such will serve us well in the years ahead.”
Barron was charged with leading the task force on electronic communication policy last April, amidst a scandal that erupted over two rounds of searches of resident dean email accounts, one of which violated Faculty email privacy policy. While Barron and 16 professors and administrators from across the University worked on their report, interim guidelines installed by Faust have constituted the University’s electronic communications policy since August 2013.

University President Drew G. Faust spent her Wednesday afternoon at an open forum for students, offering talking points on Harvard’s sexual assault policies and student group funding—and then taking selfies with members of the Undergraduate Council.
 At the end of the forum, Faust took “multiple” selfies with the group, according to UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15. “She was surprisingly a really good sport about it,” considering that the event was running overtime, he added.
“UC Open Forum with President Faust!! But first, let's take a selfie,” reads the caption of the photo—obviously destined for as much stardom as the Oscar selfie—on Goffard’s Facebook page.
If only Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister had joined in on the fun. Talk about #celebritystatus.
