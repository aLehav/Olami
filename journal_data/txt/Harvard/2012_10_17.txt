After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was eight. My third grade teacher, in a moment I forgot or perhaps repressed (but my parents remember), told me “you didn’t think you were succeeding, did you?” The doctors made the increasingly widespread diagnosis, Attention Deficit Disorder, and offered medication, warning that it could stunt growth, cause anxiety, and even occasionally trigger psychosis. My parents took me home. Instead of medication I got a “504 Plan”: small changes in my environment that made a surprising difference. My tests stopped being timed. I no longer had to copy things from the board. I was allowed to walk around the classroom if I didn’t disturb other children.
I suppose the punch line to this story might be that I’m succeeding academically now (“aren’t I?”). But that isn’t really the point. I was diagnosed in the most educated neighborhood in America, and my parents, despite both working full-time, were willing to spend hours a day walking me through math problems until I did them on my own. They also had money for doctors and the support of the school system. My success shouldn’t really be a surprise—although I imagine it would be to my third-grade teacher—because ADD is not about intelligence, but learning style.
The punch line, or maybe just punch in the gut, came from a New York Times article last week that described how parents and doctors of struggling low-income children gave them ADD medications to help them do better in school—not because the children actually had ADD, but because they couldn’t come up with other resources. One father, who gave all four of his children Adderall “merely to help with their grades,” called his daughter “a little blah.” “If they’re feeling positive, happy, socializing more, and it’s helping them,” he asked, “why wouldn’t you? Why not?”
One reason is that Adderall is not only addictive, but can also be dangerous. The irony of the father’s quote is that his son potently exemplifies the danger of taking Adderall for “cosmetic” reasons—he became schizophrenic and suicidal at age 10.
There are some less extreme reasons, too, that are nevertheless extremely troubling. Some prominent researchers argue Adderall does not work in the long term. L. Alan Strofe, a researcher who used to promote drugs for ADD but now writes about their risks, notes that in the short term, behavioral changes can be quite striking, but—as with many similar recreational drugs—the brain develops a tolerance. Recent studies suggest that the effects of Adderall on school performance, behavior, and peer relationships last about four to eight weeks. After that, children return to their original behavior and go through withdrawal if they are taken off the medication. “Bad” behavior due to withdrawal often convinces parents that the drugs work because the child had been doing better before.  As a result, the child stays on the medication but doesn’t really benefit, and the parents and school feel that they have taken action. “Drugs get everyone—politicians, scientists, teachers and parents—off the hook,” says Stroufe. “Everyone except the children, that is.”
I write about this topic for two reasons. The first is to emphasize to those who have the options that I did that treatment without medication can work. The second is to point out, as the Times article did, that part of the reason so many children are being put on addictive drugs is that school systems and parents do not or cannot manage better. Perhaps some parents don’t want to put in the effort, but others are working two or more jobs, are uninformed, or are just desperately trying everything to get their children out of a socioeconomic wormhole.
School systems, too, are strapped for resources. One school superintendent in California told the New York Times that as school funding declined, the number of children on ADD medication rose. It’s easy to imagine how the correlation could be causal: pills are a less expensive alternative to holistic and often much more effective long-term care. “I don’t have a whole lot of choice,” Dr. Michael Anderson told the Times. “We’ve decided as a society that it’s too expensive to modify the kid’s environment. So we have to modify the kid.” Like Anderson, I cannot believe that it is the children, rather than our school system and larger economic system, that need to be radically altered.
ADD doesn’t go away, although it can sometimes become less severe if the patient spends years practicing organizational skills and strengthening their mental capabilities. This is extremely taxing, but it also teaches larger lessons. From my ADD, I learned to ask for help, to try again, to fail some things, to not need to be the best. I learned the virtue of work and a little humility, as well. Most of all, I learned to be grateful for the one and only brain I will ever have and to recognize its beauty and worth even when others did not. But all this took a great deal of support that many students—with and without ADD—cannot find.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday’s vice-presidential debate, tense and punctuated by unsportsmanlike interjections and guffaws, was more than a critical contest in this (now) close election. For the 25 percent of Americans who identify as Catholic, it was a historic showdown between two men with radically different conceptions of how to live out their Catholic faith in the public sphere. Moderator Martha Raddatz addressed this conflict in her penultimate question: “Tell me what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion.”
While the issue of abortion has certainly cost the Democratic Party the votes of socially conservative Catholics who consider the issue paramount, it’s not the only point at which the Democratic platform sharply diverges from Catholic social principles. The Catholic Church draws a crucial distinction between its teachings in matters of faith and the principles of prudential judgment required to apply these teachings to political concerns. Two other ways in which the Democratic platform’s ideals conflict with moral principles of the Catholic Church are in subsidiarity and individual charity. The Party insists on undermining structures of civil society and proposes to substitute redistributivism for the virtue of charity.
The DNC’s assertion that “government is the only thing we all belong to” reveals a profound indifference to those institutions that stand between the federal government and the individual and bind us together in more personal ways than national citizenship. This has been evidenced by Obama’s attacks on these institutions, most infamously to those Catholic hospitals unwilling to provide access to sterilizations, abortions, and contraception through the HHS Mandate. Pope Benedict XVI expressed his concern about “the efforts [that] are being made to redefine and restrict the exercise of the right to religious freedom," here referring to the HHS Mandate (no matter what Biden says about it).  
Despite the clarity of life issues and the weakness of Biden’s “personally pro-life but pro-choice position,” some Catholics have argued this election that the Democrats have a claim to moral superiority in their care for the poor through increased government welfare programs. This was most notably characterized in recent months by the “Nuns on a Bus” movement, an attack on Paul Ryan’s budget proposals as violating the Church’s principle of the necessity to care for the poor. But Paul Ryan’s budget does not neglect the poor: it encourages them to provide for themselves instead of instead of beginning a dependence on government welfare that may last for generations. And seeks to allow people in communities to care for each other, instead of sending their money to the government in taxes and having it funneled through bureaucratic inefficiencies before being sent back to those in need. Finally, it recognizes that there are many difficulties facing the poor, not all of which can alleviated by government aid.
In both of these cases, the Democratic assumption is that it is the federal government’s job to care for the people, which directly contradicts the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, the idea that affairs should be conducted at a level as localized as possible. Pope Pius XI first introduced this as an important element of Catholic social thought in his encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, 1931. John Paul II was expanding on this, in a way, when he said, “so goes the family…. so goes the world in which we live.” The family is the center of Catholic society, the primary economic and provisional care unit. When a family lacks something, it can nearly always be better aided by other families in the community than by the state, and by the state than by the federal government. But the federal government should only undertake what cannot be provided for at these other levels.
All of this is not to say that the Republican Party abides by the principle of subsidiarity perfectly. It doesn’t—but its platform at least is not in direct conflict with it. When one looks at the tendencies of the Democratic Party both to force American Catholics to violate their Catholic principles through actions like the HHS mandate and excessive federal welfare programs and to disobey directly Catholic moral teaching on issues like abortion and same sex marriage, it’s a wonder that Catholics are a 25 percent divided and that a vice-presidential debate with two Catholics can even happen at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Voice, a group on campus that runs a satire blog called “Noice,” has come under critique for a post that appeared on its blog last week. The post, entitled “5 People You’ll See at Pre-Interview Receptions,” attempted to present a “satirical” take on the types of people who turn up to on-campus recruiting events. The author unfortunately included the category “The Asian,” noting that Asian Harvard students at recruiting events all dress similarly and are “practically indistinguishable from one another, but it’s okay.” A few days after it was originally published, the post remains, but the second category has been changed to “The Super-Interviewee.”
Of the many ridiculous elements of this situation, one was the litany of editors’ notes and unexplained corrections that appeared on the blog post in succession. For example, the author of the piece was changed from “The Voice Staff” to the not-much-more-elucidating “Anonymous.” The Voice also published different versions of an editors’ note while it repeatedly revised the article to edit out racist content. Notably, the author of the piece also left a comment, which read in part, “Clearly, I’ve been censored, which in itself is an interesting reflection on free speech in America. If you couldn’t tell that this article was satire, then we have bigger problems than me being ‘offensive.’”
Although this particular post has come to national media attention—perhaps in part because of the editors’ ridiculously poor ability to recognize and handle offensive writing—this kind of satire is not new to the Voice’s blog. For example, a post written last year entitled “Ten Guys You’ll Meet at Harvard” joked about “The one who’s gay” that “The Harvard homosexual guy is well-dressed, charming, good-looking, smart and gets you… Except that it’s physiologically impossible. Unless you drug him or something.”
Every publication should strive to exclude content that is explicitly or implicitly oppressive, be it, for example, racist, sexist, or homophobic. Of course, The Crimson has not always been perfect itself in this regard—for example, as news writer Amy L. Weiss-Meyer noted in her story about the blog post controversy, the Crimson published an offensive endpaper about ten years ago that made similar generalizations about Asians on campus. Promulgating racial stereotypes, even in the name of humor, promotes a wider social fragmentation that is sadly very real on campus. And it should be clear that neither the ethnicity of nor the intent at humor by an author matter if the content produced simply serves to reinforce the kind of problematic stereotypes that oppress groups of people.
Importantly, a paper or publication redacting offensive content, or refusing to publish it in the first place, is not a limitation of anyone’s free speech. The writer who penned a “note from the writer”—and others who have protested that “censoring” offensive content by refusing to publish it is a limitation of freedom—demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the idea of free speech as well as a poor standard of journalism. A publication has the right to decide what kind of speech or writing is acceptable for inclusion. Deciding not to publish or to remove oppressive content is not an inhibition of anyone’s free speech, and is an important measure for editors who strive to make their publications decent, just, and well-respected.
We do appreciate the apology posted yesterday on the Voice’s blog by the Voice’s co-president and editor, April A. Sperry '13. The apology noted, “The Voice is not always politically correct, but it never actively aims to hurt or insult. Snarky and pithy writing is amusing—offensive writing is not… hyperbole, humor, and social commentary can all happen without singling out a person or group of people. Talking pejoratively about Asian students in the recruiting process was both unnecessary and uncalled for.”
We agree with Sperry that there are plenty of ways to do satire that are not offensive yet still funny. Unfortunately, it seems that the writers of the Voice haven’t caught on to them. Of course, there are also ways to attempt to do satire that simply aren’t funny at all. If that’s your thing, you might want to comp the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
No matter what, though, campus publications and their writers should not publish racist or otherwise oppressive commentary. Like it or not, one does hear these kinds of stereotypes in the Harvard community. The fact that Noice’s post has brought this problem to national attention makes it an all the more unfortunate contribution to discourse at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
October is breast cancer month, as you may have noticed at this point from the vast proliferation of pink ribbons, pink shirts, pink bracelets, and pink everything appearing all across campus and across the internet. And along with this pinkness comes the extremely sexualized rhetoric around breast cancer, which is often an integral part of the aforementioned products. Bracelets emblazoned with the phrase “I Heart Boobies” and shirts that say “Save Second Base,” are widely sold and widely worn, and embody the pervasive societal trend of equating breasts with sexuality and femininity—something that should not have a place in shaping our discourse about breast cancer.
There are two overall problems with the general rhetoric around breast cancer that I wish to address: the first is the issue of the sexualization of this type of cancer, and the second is the corporatization of the same.
Using phrases like “Save Second Base,” or “Save the Ta-Tas,” on t-shirts that are supposed to be supporting breast cancer research completely devalues the lives of the women who are affected with this disease, as these messages shift the emphasis of the goal of a cure from ensuring that women live healthy lives to ensuring that men are provided with a vehicle for sexual pleasure. Evidently, these slogans are not meant to be taken in earnest. No one is seriously suggesting that the only reason that breast cancer should be cured is so that men can “score” with women. In fact, these shirts are meant to be silly. But in a culture that routinely stresses that the main purpose of the women’s bodies is to provide pleasure to men, this attempt at humor simply becomes insulting.
There is nothing sexual about someone dying of breast cancer. There is only horror and sickness, and to suggest that the purpose of finding a cure for this disease is to restore the body’s ability to please someone else, even facetiously, reduces the dying person to a body and makes a cruel joke of their pain. And what message does this send when a woman’s “boobies” have been removed in a double mastectomy? Is there nothing left to save? And is she somehow less of a woman?
Instead of reminding people of the horror of contracting and enduring this disease, these products seek to “lighten up” a discourse that arguably should not be “lightened up.” This upbeat banter takes the place of the real, serious conversations that people could be having about this disease, and that are the norm around other diseases that have similar mortality rates and health effects. No one would suggest having upbeat, silly banter about lung cancer, or about AIDS. But once breasts are involved, the conversation changes.
Many of the organizations that are either selling these products or asking for donations for breast cancer research have questionable commitments to women’s health. This was brought to light most recently when Susan J. Komen for the Cure stopped providing breast cancer exams in Planned Parenthood clinics for political reasons, thereby making questionable its true commitment to its own cause: saving women from breast cancer. Surely political worries are not more important than providing breast cancer screening to as many women as possible, especially for an organization whose goal runs along those lines. Furthermore, many companies have realized that breast cancer awareness sells, and little pink ribbons can be found almost anywhere where products are sold, from supermarkets to clothing stores. People are arguably more likely to buy bright pink yogurts that promise a one cent donation to breast cancer research because they feel that they are doing good, but what they are really doing is contributing to the profits of a for-profit company that has seized on breast cancer as a good business ploy. Whether or not the company in question is run by people who truly care about finding a cure for cancer, the use of this disease to sell products is disturbing.
All in all, I am not suggesting that people pay less attention to breast cancer or donate less money to breast cancer research. It is a terrible, terrible disease that causes close to 40,000 women every year to die a slow and painful death, and certainly deserves a great deal of attention. However, fostering a public discourse that equates breast cancer awareness with femininity and sexual objectification is not productive and is actually detrimental to women everywhere. It sends the message that the suffering of women is more relevant when it somehow threatens the pleasure of men, and this, in a way, reduces the value of the women who are affected with the ailment to their bodies rather than empowering women everywhere and creating an honest and thoughtful dialogue about this awful disease.

At Tuesday’s meeting of the Early Childhood Development Collective, Ananda M. Martin-Caughey ’13 presented her research from this summer: Martin-Caughey studies Mauá and Diadema, two municipalities within São Paulo, Brazil, that have vastly different child health and education statistics.
Martin-Caughey and three graduate students—Marina Correia of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and Jonathan P. Phillips and Alecia J. McGregor of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences—traveled to São Paulo this summer after receiving funding from the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
Upon their return to campus in the fall, they founded the ECDC. The student-run research group holds monthly seminars to discuss the São Paulo research and early childhood development research more generally.
Martin  Caughey said presenting her summer research, upon which she hopes to build a thesis, before a diverse audience was an invaluable experience. “I think it’s very easy when writing your thesis to get stuck in your way of thinking,” Martin-Caughey said. “Everyone today gave me great feedback and I was busy scribbling notes throughout.”
As Timothy P. Linden ’12, a post-graduate fellow with DRCLAS, said the grants that took Martin-Caughey and her peers to São Paulo hinged on a recent partnership between Harvard and Brazilian researchers. Fundação Maria Cecília Souto Vidigal, a non-governmental organization based in São Paulo, financed both Harvard student and faculty research on early childhood development in Brazil. “[The funding]’s coming through us,” Linden said, “but it’s all made possible by the foundation.”
Holding diverse academic backgrounds, the four Harvard student researchers who traveled to São Paulo this summer tackled their research from different perspectives. Phillips, a Ph.D candidate in Government, examined how government accountability relates to health and education services. Meanwhile, Marina Correia, an architect, studied the how urban infrastructure affected early childhood development.
Despite the differences in their research objectives, the four found in each other an academic support network. According to Phillips, group discussion helped everyone clarify their understanding of the political and economic systems at work in the country.
“Understanding just the mechanics of what goes on, I don’t think that would have been possible to do alone just because it’s such a big country,” Phillips said.

While satellites orbit the Earth and spacecraft have traveled to other cosmic bodies, the Sun has thus far escaped human exploration.
This will change, however, in 2018, according to astronomy lecturer Justin C. Kasper in a talk on Tuesday regarding NASA’s impending solar probe.
“Solar Probe Plus is a really exciting mission at the forefront of scientific space exploration,” Kasper said in his lecture. “We are going to make great leaps in understanding some of the fundamental questions in heliophysics.”
Kasper is a principal investigator at NASA, and his work focuses on the “crown” that surrounds the Sun, or the corona, which has historically been an area of contention among astronomers.
Very little is definitively known about the corona, but scientists have determined that there exists a volatile part, dubbed “solar wind,” in which the particles accelerate to supersonic speeds.
According to Kasper, however, a few fundamental questions remain unsolved by astronomers after 50 years of extensive research. These questions form the crux of his Solar Probe Plus mission.
“First, what gives the corona its structure? And second, what heats and accelerates the solar wind?” Kasper said.
In order to answer these questions, Kasper and his team are constructing a spacecraft to fly directly into the corona to take concrete measurements. The mission is Kasper’s own personal project, one that has been under discussion since 1990. After receiving NASA’s approval for the venture in 2008, the specific instruments needed for the mission were selected in 2010. The construction of the actual equipment and spacecraft is beginning this year.
In preemptive defense of a common argument that space exploration is both irrelevant and frivolous in this period of economic decline, Kasper emphasized the practical aspects of his work.
“Fundamentally it’s helping us better understand our home in space,” he said. “It also helps us in very practical terms too. This research will help us comprehend space weather and forecast solar events that have the potential to disrupt activities here on Earth.”
Audience members said that they were intrigued by the questions tackled in the talk and the potential impact that the solar probe could have on current understandings of the solar system.
“I like unsolved mysteries. In class they just tell us that the corona is really hot and that we don’t know why,” said Nicholas M. Induni ’15. “It’s amazing to see that there is an actual craft being constructed and that we are flying it to the sun to actually get to the bottom of these questions.”
According to Kasper, this mission is a product of the sudden focus on sun-centered space exploration in the field of astronomy.
“There are a lot of very exciting opportunities both to explore new places to which we’ve never sent spacecraft and to make discoveries that will have impacts back here on Earth,” he said.

Despite the assumption that vitamins are always beneficial, Harvard School of Public Health researchers asserted in a study released Tuesday that high doses of multivitamins may instead have adverse side effects for HIV patients taking antiretroviral drugs.
High doses rather than standard doses of multivitamin supplements could result in increased levels of an enzyme affecting liver function, commonly an indication of liver damage. After examining the study’s findings, Sheila Isanaka, a research fellow at the School of Public Health involved in the test, recommended that patients taking highly active antiretroviral therapy—called HAART for short—consume only standard levels of vitamins.
While previous studies have concluded that nutritional supplements slow HIV disease progression and improve immune function among patients before they start taking HAART, data from this trial in Tanzania indicate that while on HAART, patients do not benefit from an increased multivitamin regimen.
“The general assumption that nutritional intervention is always beneficial needs to be looked at,” said Wafaie W. Fawzi, the School of Public Health professor who served as the director of the study based in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.
The five-year study emerged from a long relationship between HSPH and research institutions in Tanzania. More than 20 trials have been conducted that examine nutritional effects on pregnant women, pre-natal health, and infectious diseases such as HIV. The most recent study included 3,418 HIV-positive patients who had already started antiretroviral therapy.
“We randomly assigned half of the patients to receive high doses of supplements including vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and vitamin E and the other half to receive standard doses at the recommended dietary allowance level,” Isanaka wrote in an email from France. “High-dose supplementation had no effect on several key measures that reveal HIV disease progression—CD4 count, plasma viral load, body mandex, or hemoglobin level concentration.”
The only measurable difference between the two groups was the increased risk of liver damage in those patients on the high-dose nutrition supplement. “Many times we think that nutritional supplements are good,” Fawzi said. “And it’s only through rigorous studies...that one is able to identify whether that is indeed the case.”
Isanaka says further research would need to include a placebo group in patients already taking HAART to ascertain if indeed nutritional supplements slow the progression of HIV at all and to learn which combinations of micronutrients are most beneficial to patients.
Researchers will make the findings of their study available to physicians in both Tanzania and the United States. Fawzi said that the possible adverse effects of high-dose multivitamins in patients taking HAART may influence the dosage decisions of doctors and patients. “[It is] a point to note and be cautious about in the future,” he said.

A roundtable on the role of history and the law in the current presidential election drew a crowd in the Barker Center Tuesday night.
Jill Lepore, a history professor and moderator for the panel, said during her introductory remarks that the roundtable was “organized because we wanted to bring together scholars across the University who are writing on these topics.”
The event’s interdisciplinary scope, with faculty members present from the history department, the Law School, and the Kennedy School of Government, resulted in a diversity of approaches to the discussion topic.
Law School professor Annette Gordon-Reed touched on questions of American identity and said that the conception of social security as anti-American has forced Obama to defend his healthcare plan, despite its relative conservatism, from perceptions that it is an “‘everyone is going to be in the gulag’ type move.”
Elizabeth Hinton, a visiting fellow in Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan, raised concerns regarding a mass disenfranchisement of the population—largely people of color—due to the fact that voting rights are not reinstated for ex-felons even when they have left prison.
“One in four adult Americans has lost the right to vote due to a felony conviction,” Hinton said. “More than any single group, ex-felon disenfranchisement disproportionately affects people of color,” she added.
Jed Shugerman, assistant professor at HLS discussed the role of the government in the economy, while Kenneth W. Mack, a profesor at the Law School, talked about the possible lessons to be learned from the 1896 election, where there was more campaign spending per capita than in any election since.
When the floor opened to questions, attendees coming from BU, NYU, and the Harvard community voiced concerns regarding issues such as the impoverished nature of political conversation about inequality, the role of body language in the perception of debate success, and the possibility that we have reached an age of “post-truth” elections.
To conclude the event, Lepore posed one last question.
“What sentence do you want to hear at tonight’s debate?” she asked the panelists.
After a pensive silence, Alexander Keyssar ’69, a professor of history and social policy at the Kennedy School quipped, to audience applause, “I withdraw from the race.”
Audience member and Law School program administrator Melissa A. Smith said that the roundtable was sobering.
“I was optimistic and now I’m frightened,” she said. “The whole tenor of the campaign has changed in the past two weeks.”

University President Drew G. Faust said that building Harvard’s long-delayed Science Center in Allston will be a focal point of the University’s imminent capital campaign.
“For the health and life sciences building, we will be making it a campaign priority,” Faust said about the Allston Health and Life Science Center, which the University started building but abruptly stopped during the 2009 economic downturn.
The capital campaign, currently in a period called a “quiet phase” in which the University gathers contributions from major donors, is expected to launch publicly next year with a goal of raising at least $6 billion—which would make it the largest ever run by a university.
Faust said that Harvard is mulling methods of financing the Allston science complex. “We’re just working on trying to balance those things out,” she said of the potential options for funding the building.
Faust said earlier that a campus wide student-center, tentatively envisioned in the location of the current Holyoke Center, would also be a priority of the campaign.
Currently, the location of the Allston Science Center is an empty, fenced-off construction site, a remnant of the University’s initial push for Allston development in 2007. During that year, the University filed its first Institutional Master Plan for Allston development, which called for substantial renovations and construction across Harvard’s Allston properties. The plan included the creation of a cultural center in the Barry’s Corner area at the intersection of Western Ave. and North Harvard St. and the construction of a $1 billion science center, which officials imagined as a mecca for stem-cell research.
University development in Allston came to an abrupt halt, however, due to Harvard’s financial problems in 2009. The construction machinery stopped working, leaving a gaping hole where the Science Center was supposed to stand and multiple vacant properties throughout Allston. Harvard’s decision to cease construction sparked tension with many members of the community, who felt Harvard had betrayed them by not fulfilling its promise to develop Allston.
In 2011, the University announced that it would resume planning for Allston development.
Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp said then that the Science Center would represent Harvard’s single largest investment ever made into a science facility. In June, the University announced that stem-cell research and bioengineering would be two departments moving into the new Science Center.
At the time, Harvard Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey said that the Center would be between 500,000 and 600,000 square feet, with room for 500 scientists in addition to support staff.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences ended fiscal year 2012 with a balanced budget for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, successfully meeting the timeline set by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith when he laid out his fiscal recovery plan three years ago.
Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 presented the financial report to administrators and faculty at this month’s faculty meeting, announcing a $73,000 budget surplus for FY2012.
“[It was] admittedly a squeaker on a budget our size,” Kirwan said. The entire FAS budget for FY2012 totaled $1.2 billion.
In the financial segment in the 2012 FAS Annual Report, Kirwan cited Harvard’s 4 percent increase in endowment payout and 6.7 increase in total revenue last year, as well as “the faculty’s success in continuing on a path of fiscal discipline” as factors that contributed to the new fiscal balance.
When the financial crisis hit in 2008, Harvard’s endowment suffered a 30 percent decrease in value, at the time a crippling loss for FAS, which relies on the endowment for close to half of its funding. Smith announced a multi-year plan of action for FY2009-2011 to close a projected two-year deficit of $220 million.
Despite reaching the three-year target, Kirwan sounded a note of caution.
“Over 60 percent of the endowment losses have not yet been restored,” she said.
Ongoing investments also pose a challenge to the school’s fiscal discipline. This year’s announced surplus for FAS’s unrestricted core operations—which consists of the Faculty, the College, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences—did not include investments in edX and House Renewal, which when taken into account bring the budget balance down to a $9.7 million deficit.
The complete unrestricted FAS budget—which includes other major affiliates of FAS such as the athletic department and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—came in at a deficit of $34.9 million.
In the annual report, Kirwan cautioned faculty members on the financial outlook for  FY2013 and onward.
“Ongoing upward pressure on some of our expense categories, coupled with, at best, modest increases to our key revenue sources for the foreseeable future, suggest that sustained fiscal balance will require our continued focus and innovation,” Kirwan wrote.
The FY2012 return on the endowment was more disappointing than the prior year’s results which boosted the balanced budget. The endowment dropped slightly in value, the first time it did not show positive gains since FY2009.
Kirwan named the loss of sponsored revenue, meaning federal funding, as one of the biggest factors likely to constrain the budget. Sponsored revenue currently represents 18 percent of the FAS budget, a “bright spot” during FAS’ financial hardships in the last four years, she said at last month’s Faculty Meeting. But Kirwan said that “the likelihood of meaningful declines in federal funding is high.” FAS faces the new threat of sequestration—across-the-board federal spending cuts that are automatically triggered if Congress fails to produce a balanced budget by the end of this calendar year.
To cope with the possible cuts, FAS has hired two new staff members in Research Administration Services to help faculty­—in the arts, humanities, and social sciences as well as sciences—find and apply for more grants from private foundations and corporate sponsors, in addition to a few untapped federal grants.
The second of these two new employees began work on Monday, according to Associate Dean for Research Administration Patrick W. Fitzgerald.
“We’re just started getting the word out—reach out to faculty and let them know that we’re available,” Fitzgerald said, adding that his office can offer “expertise” to faculty who do not have experience with the grants process.
Molecular and Cellular Biology Director of Research Affairs Feng Chen said that the reduction in federal funding is probably felt most acutely by junior faculty in science fields, who need seed funding to begin the research necessary for getting tenure.
“The success rate has really become really low,” Chen said. “And I think this is probably not unique to FAS or Harvard alone—everywhere you go, people are talking about how to explore unconventional resources to support research.”
Faculty are spending more and more time on the paperwork to apply for as many grants as possible, Chen added.
“I think all faculty realize that the competition for research funding is intensified,” said Susan O. Gomes, FAS director of research development. “The key word is strategy,” she added, emphasizing that the government has invested more money in some areas even while slashing other funds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part I in a series on the presidential election's impact on the issues that Harvard lobbies on. Read Part II on research funding and Part III on immigration.
The federal government’s approach to higher education funding, particularly student financial aid, could change significantly with November’s presidential election, potentially altering the way millions of students think about and pay for college.
While Harvard undergraduates, who benefit from Harvard’s own robust financial aid program, rely less on federal aid than students elsewhere and usually graduate with less debt, the University has a vested interest in national student aid policies nonetheless. Harvard spends hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to lobby Congress, the White House, and the Department of Education on a variety of issues, and education funding often figures prominently in those conversations. According to public filings made with the House of Representatives and the Senate, the University’s efforts touched on Pell Grants, Perkins loans, Stafford loans, and other student aid issues in the first two quarters of 2012, in which Harvard spent $350,000 on lobbying overall.
“We believe that a large reason why the United States has been a pillar—really the leader internationally without argument in higher education” is the robustness of its financial aid, said Harvard Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey, the University’s chief lobbyist. “We worry about the erosion of some of those supports for students.”
“It’s very important, we think, as a principle, that there’s enough support for students where they can make individual decisions to seek the kind of education that they’re capable of achieving,” Casey added. “Therefore we think it’s important for all students to feel they can afford to go wherever they can go.”
November’s presidential election could determine the future finances of aid programs that make those choices possible.
ONE PROBLEM, TWO PLANS FOR AID
Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney have laid out two vastly different plans for how federal grant and loan programs would work in their respective administrations.
Obama, who worked during his first term to expand grant funding and nationalize the student loan market, has pledged to keep interest rates low and to further expand Pell Grant eligibility and other federal tax credits for students. In his own plan, Romney has said he would restrict Pell Grants to those who most need them, re-privatize the college loan market, and rely on market forces moderate the rising cost of college education.
The urgency of the debate over higher education aid bespeaks the ballooning of the student debt crisis, which for decades has been escalating alongside rising tuition costs. The president elected in November will face the largest student debt crisis in the country’s history: nearly two-thirds of college students and recent graduates owe a combined $1 trillion to creditors.
The candidates’ respective approaches to the student debt crisis highlight their divergent views on the role of the federal government more broadly.
Obama would increase funding for the Pell Grant program, which offers direct aid to the lowest-income students in the nation, and would raise the maximum amount awarded to individuals through the program. One of the country’s most popular aid sources, Pell Grants currently go to more than 9 million students. The president would also make permanent the American Opportunity tax credit which his administration created in 2009 and which is set to expire in January.
During his first term, the President instituted a “Pay As You Earn” policy for federal loans, capping monthly payments to 15 percent of an individual’s discretionary income. If re-elected, Obama has said, he would work to institute a policy forgiving all federal student loan debt after 20 years.
Romney’s education proposals, while less precise, lay out a vision for a leaner federal aid system more influenced by market forces. His education plan released in April, titled “A Chance For Every Child,” calls for the federal government to end the “expanding entitlement mentality” that has arisen around direct aid programs like Pell Grants.
“A Romney Administration will refocus Pell Grant dollars on the students that need them most and place the program on a responsible long-term path that avoids future funding cliffs and last-minute funding patches,” the plan reads.
Romney said he would re-introduce competition to the federal loan market by putting lending back into the private sector, which would undo the Obama administration’s efforts.
The plan says a Romney administration would “focus the Department on giving students and families with financial need the appropriate information about completion and persistence, loan repayment rates, future earnings, and other indicators to intelligently weigh the risks and benefits of the many options available to them, rather than limiting choices through punitive regulations.”
Whether or not Romney would cut federal spending on education across the board is uncertain. In the first presidential debate two weeks ago he pledged to preserve existing spending levels.
“I’m not going to cut education funding,” he said. “I don’t have any plan to cut education funding and—and grants that go to people going to college.”
But analyses of the Republican’s budget plan have shown Romney would cut education funding up to 20 percent. His running mate Paul D. Ryan’s own budget, which Romney has supported in the past, would let the American Opportunity tax credit expire and cap Pell Grant funding at its current level with an eye toward further cuts.
FOCUSED ON THE PRICE TAG
Both candidates have pledged to address the rising cost of college education, which they both pinpoint as the root of the student debt problem. During the 2011-12 school year, tuition and fees for four-year colleges were expected to average $8,240 for public schools and $28,500 for private schools, according to the College Board, a private national organization that represents more than 6,000 colleges and universities. In the past five years, tuition costs have grown 5.1 percent annually beyond the inflation rate.
In January, Obama proposed tying federal aid for Perkins loans and work-study subsidies to tuition in order to compel colleges to reign in costs if they hope to maintain federal subsidies. Though its sticker price ranks among the highest in the country, Harvard would not be subjected to funding cuts because its institutional financial aid program keeps what students pay low.
Similarly, Romney has said he would force universities to streamline costs. He said universities have had little incentive to make tuition more affordable with the influx of federal money under the Obama administration.
Also potentially in the balance are interest rates on federal Stafford loans. Congress voted in June to stop interest rates for the popular loans from doubling to 6.8 percent. Obama lowered the rate of the popular federal loans to 3.4 percent in 2009 and has pledged to keep it low if reelected. Ryan’s budget calls for the higher rate, and Romney’s statements on the question have been inconclusive.
TAKING A STANCE, NOT A CANDIDATE
Harvard’s financial aid program, which gives grant aid to 60 percent of the student body, relies less on federal loans than other public and private universities. Still, roughly 25 percent of students elect to take additional federal aid, usually in the form of loans.
“While we cannot speculate on the impact of the election on federal support for student aid, it is clear the country is facing some critical fiscal challenges and that federal support for student aid and research could be substantially impacted by the decisions made in coming months and years,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement. “President [Drew G.] Faust, along with many of her colleagues, has worked hard in Washington to remind policymakers of the value of the federal partnership with universities in support of the next generation of leaders, innovators and new ideas to fuel the economy.”
Former University President Derek C. Bok said a university like Harvard must actively promote generous grant and loan policies for the good of colleges as a whole.
“All thinking people at Harvard ought to recognize that as far as higher education is concerned, it is quite important,” Bok said. “I hope that Harvard will always feel a certain special concern for higher education generally, whether its specific ox is being gored or not.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Barack Obama’s lead among young people age 18 to 29 has increased slightly since March to 19 percentage points with less than three weeks until election day, according to a new survey by Harvard’s Institute of Politics released Wednesday morning.
Obama, who won handily among young voters in 2008 but has seen enthusiasm for his campaign wane this time around, leads former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney 55 percent to 36 percent among young people, the survey showed.
Obama’s lead among likely college voters, is significantly smaller, however, at 10 percentage points.
Even as the president remains popular among young people, excitement about the election among that group continues to dip. Though 67 percent of those surveyed said they were registered to vote, only 48 percent said they “definitely” plan to vote on Nov. 6. Among college students, only 63 percent of those surveyed said they are registered, compared to 79 percent in 2008. Only 48 percent said the “definitely” plan to cast a ballot on election day.
“Unfortunately I think we’re headed for a serious step back in participation and turnout,” said John Della Volpe, the IOP’s director of polling, who oversaw the survey. “We’re looking at 4-5 million fewer voters under 30 years old,” he added.
The reason, IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 said, is that a growing number of young people are disillusioned by the stalemate in Congress and persistent weakness in the economy.
Forty-three percent of those surveyed agreed it does not matter who is elected in November, Washington is broken. Additionally, 31 percent agreed that neither of the candidates represent their views.
The IOP pollsters said this trend should be particularly troubling for Obama, who relied heavily on young people in 2008. While 52 percent of those surveyed said they think Obama will win re-election, Romney voters seem more committed to showing their support with 65 percent saying they will “definitely” vote compared to only 55 percent of Obama supporters who say they will “definitely” vote.
Despite their disillusionment with Washington, most in the survey still favor Obama’s policy stances.
The survey, which overlapped with the first presidential debate, showed young voters still trust Obama more than Romney on a number of issues from health care to foreign policy. Forty-seven percent of young voters also said they trust Obama more than they trust Romney to deal with the ailing economy, the area where Romney is generally perceived to be the strongest. Only 28 percent said they trust Romney more.
In evaluating the job Obama has done as president, 62 percent agreed that the problems he faced upon entering office are “so complex it takes more than 4 years to do the job.” Thirty-three percent disagreed, responding that “despite his best efforts, Obama has failed.”
The IOP survey, taken between Sept. 19 and Oct. 3, asked 2,123 18- to 29-year old U.S, citizens a range of questions about November’s presidential election and their political mood more generally. The survey has a 2.1-point margin of error.
A similar survey taken by the IOP in March, showed Obama leading Romney 51 percent to 34 percent overall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the very first second of the 2012-13 season, it was clear that this will be a year of change for the Harvard men’s basketball team.
When the Crimson stepped onto the court at Lavietes Pavilion for its first practice on Saturday, not only was Kanye West’s “All of the Lights” (Harvard’s theme song on its run to back-to-back Ivy League titles) replaced as the Crimson’s intro track, but Harvard was also missing four starters from last year’s championship squad.
That made Saturday’s “Crimson Madness” event especially interesting. For the first time this season, Harvard fans got a glimpse of a number of unfamiliar faces who will be called on to play major minutes this season.
From the opening tap, all eyes were on rookie Siyani Chambers, a 6’0 point guard expected to run the Crimson offense this season. Chambers handled himself well in the intrasquad scrimmage, displaying his quickness and strong ball handling skills.
While Chambers deferred to his teammates in the half court, the rookie proved dangerous with the ball in the open court, converting two and-one layups in transition.
“He can really make things happen,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s capable of helping us, and we’re certainly going to rely on him.”
Perhaps even more important to the Crimson’s success than his ball handling or quickness, Chambers showed his endurance on Saturday afternoon: after nearly 20 minutes of play, Chambers was still pressuring sophomore point guard Alex Nesbitt.
Harvard, which has only two true point guards on its roster, will likely rely on Chambers for long stretches of play.
According to Amaker, sophomore Wesley Saunders, who played on the wing last season, may spell Chambers at the point. The 6’5” Saunders has been working on his ball handling and tried his hand at the point during the Crimson’s exhibition matches in Italy in August.
“We certainly think that Wesley’s capable of playing any position on the perimeter for us,” Amaker said.
After leading the Crimson in scoring in Italy, Saunders turned in another strong performance on Saturday, finishing with 13 points in the 20-minute matchup.
“He’s certainly capable of being a marquee guy,” Amaker said of Saunders. “He really kind of shot out of a cannon when we played in Italy.”
While Saunders relied mostly on his athleticism and ability to get into the paint to put points on the board, he also showed signs of an improved jumper: midway through the scrimmage, Saunders, without hesitation, drilled a jumper from just inside the three-point line off the bounce, a shot he rarely attempted as a rookie.
Sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi also displayed some new skills, putting the ball on the deck and finishing a lefty layup to score the first two points of the scrimmage. The 6’7 forward finished with 10 points, while classmate Jonah Travis recorded 12.
But it was rookie Patrick Steeves who led all scorers, collecting a game-high 14 points while knocking down four three-pointers.
“You saw exactly what he’s capable of doing which is to make open shots,” Amaker said of the 6’7 wing from Quebec. “He did a nice job. It was impressive to see that.”
Co-captain Christian Webster missed Saturday’s scrimmage with a dislocated finger.
“I anticipate him to be back sooner than later,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s already the middle of October, and for most Harvard students that’s not a good thing.
Mid-October is difficult for just about everyone. Now that work is actually due, about 90 percent of Harvard students are panicking as they try to cram the first 12 lectures that nobody paid attention to.
Unfortunately, factions are starting to form amongst the student body. The California kids are complaining about the 50-degree temperatures and breaking out their heavy winter jackets while they dream of Stanford graduate school. More and more students are starting to pick sides as Joe Biden rudely interrupts Paul Ryan on national TV. Oh, and the MLB playoffs are in full swing, which is great except that the Massholes remain as salty as a saltine over the abysmal Red Sox season.
Harvard’s athletes are trying their best to balance this hectic fall schedule. Fall sports are winding down, winter sports are getting ready to rumble, and the whole world waits for the next Harvard baseball music video.
Here are some tweets from those busy Crimson athletes.  We assume they came during breaks in work, but if not, they can distract you from that pset or paper that’s due in two hours.
1) If you’ve taken a walk around the yard, you might have noticed the people dressed up in colonial garb.  No? Well, junior wrestler Paul Liguori sure has:
“I'm aware of the history of the Boston area, but I find it sorta strange that I see between 2-7 people dressed as pilgrims every week.”
Like we said earlier, Paul, these are trying times for the people of Massachusetts.  The Red Sox sucked and Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown are waging war in the polls.  History is the only thing keeping them together.  You probably won’t see any Indians, though, since they sorta stole the most successful and popular manager in recent Red Sox history. That’s going to be an awkward Thanksgiving...
2) Kit Metoyer, a freshman point guard for the women’s baskeball team, is not pleased with her finals schedule:
“December 21st is after all my finals, which means I'll have to take them before we all die. PISSED.”
Just so we’re clear, you believe the whole world is going to end and the only problem you have with that is it’s not going to happen before finals? The whole impending doom and death thing doesn’t really bother you? Well. On the bright side of things, if the Mayans are correct you won’t receive your grades on the finals anyway.
Those are your tweets of the week.  Hopefully these athletes took your mind off of that mountain of October work. Happy climbing!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On game day just a year ago, then-sophomore Ricky Zorn would most likely have been found on the sidelines. Flash forward a full season, and the junior now leads the receiving corps for the Harvard football team.
Zorn has become a prominent force on an already dominant Crimson offense this fall. Just halfway into the 2012 season, the junior has nabbed 17 receptions and caught two touchdowns. But things weren’t always this way for Zorn, who had never started a college game before the contest against Holy Cross, not even a month ago.
The receiver was recruited to Harvard as a quarterback, having excelled at the position during his tenure at Lake Highlands High School.
“When we recruited Ricky, I remember going to his high school in Dallas,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “The first thing his head coach said was, ‘This kid is an outstanding quarterback, but boy, he’s really an outstanding athlete, [the] best athlete in the high school.’”
All-around athlete is a term that is central to describing Zorn, who earned a total of nine letters throughout high school in football, basketball, baseball, and track and field. He was named all-district twice in basketball.
“I think there are a lot of similarities between basketball and football,” Zorn said. “When you’re up there catching the ball in the air, it’s pretty similar to getting a rebound in the way you use your body to box out defenders. There are definitely some skills from basketball that translate into football.”
Upon his arrival in Cambridge in 2010, Zorn resumed his training as a quarterback but quickly moved to the defense.
“I had a week at quarterback, and then I had a meeting with our quarterback coach,” Zorn said. “He thought it would be better if I moved to defensive back. At the time there were a lot of injuries in the secondary, so it was a good opportunity, and I would probably be able to get on the field faster at a different position.”
At 6’1” and 190 pounds, with an explosive ability to run and jump, Zorn has an ideal body type for a strong corner. But he quickly injured his shoulder and missed most of his freshman fall.
At the end of the spring season, Zorn began his return to the offense. He planned to train with then-freshman quarterback Michael Pruneau over the summer in Texas.
“I asked Coach Murphy if it would be alright if I started learning the offense, so just in case next year they ever needed an extra guy at wide receiver, at least I’d already know the offense,” Zorn explained. “And he said, ‘You know, I like that. I think that would be a good fit for you.’”
Zorn worked with Pruneau over the break and transitioned back to the offense that fall, spending most of the season accumulating playing time on the junior varsity team and eventually moving up to varsity towards the end.
“Sophomore year was just a chance to learn the offense even more [and to] get some actual practice and game situations,” he said.
It was last April’s Spring Game that revealed to Coach Murphy and anyone with an eye on Harvard football exactly what a threat he could be in the passing game.
During the annual inter-squad scrimmage, Zorn out-caught the rest of the receivers, connecting with then-junior quarterback Colton Chapple for five catches.
With sophomore wideout Seitu Smith II out with injury for the year, it has been Zorn and fellow junior receiver Andrew Berg flanking Chapple this season.
“I feel very blessed that [Zorn] has been able to have the opportunity to play football in college,” his mother, Sandra Zorn, said. “I’m also glad to see Ricky back on offense because being a quarterback in high school was quite an exciting time, watching Ricky lead the team and scoring tons of touchdowns.”
Zorn’s first start under the lights came in the freezing rain in Harvard’s 52-3 victory over Holy Cross, and the junior racked up 99 yards including six receptions and a touchdown catch. The next week, he delivered again. Zorn put up 100 yards, five receptions and another score against Cornell.
“The kid works incredibly hard,” Muphy said. “He’s a very focused and serious kid in the best possible context.... He’s a strictly [lead] by action, by example guy.”
Berg echoed the coach’s sentiments.
“That kid’s just a perfect kid,” Berg said. “He’s the type of kid you want to have in your family. I’m really happy for him. He’s having a great year.”
With the momentum of 14 straight wins dating back to last season, the Crimson appears unstoppable heading into the second half of this fall’s play.  Zorn’s talents at wideout will be crucial for Harvard both this season and in the future.
“We haven’t reached his potential because he’s only played a couple of games,” Murphy said. “I still think he has a lot of potential to get even better.”

It was a situation that the Harvard women’s soccer team had seen before. On Tuesday night, the Crimson found itself in a scoreless tie after 45 minutes, just as it did in Saturday’s contest against Brown.
But again, Harvard (7-3-3, 2-1-1 Ivy) reeled off four second-half goals to put away its opponent. Tuesday night’s victim was Holy Cross (6-8-1, 2-2 Patriot League), which was powerless to stop the Crimson offense as Harvard rolled to a 4-0 win at Soldier’s Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
The win extended the Crimson’s unbeaten streak to six matches as Harvard took down the Crusaders for the 15th time in 18 matchups.
“It was great to get a bunch of goals in tonight and keep up what we did on Saturday [against Brown],” sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby said. “Our goal today was to keep playing like we did [on Saturday] to make sure it wasn’t a fluke. Now, we know our game is on, and we’re really ready to play.”
The Crimson’s offense, which was streaky for the beginning part of the season, has been firing on all cylinders as of late. After scoring just eight goals in seven matches dating back to a Sept. 12 game against Quinnipiac, Harvard has scored eight in its past two games.
“We have really just been focusing on finishing our chances,” Casscells-Hamby said. “We’ve had a lot of opportunities—before, we had 31 shots in a game [against Central Connecticut State] but we didn’t score a goal—and our mentality is good. So it’s something we’ve been working on, and it’s good to see it pay off.”
The Crimson dominated all facets of Tuesday night’s game. Harvard outshot the Crusaders, 19-7, in a chippy match that saw Holy Cross commit 19 fouls. Despite the Crusaders’ aggressive style of play, they managed just two shots on goal, and sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten saved both. Kanten has allowed just three goals in her past five games.
“Our defense played amazing at Brown, and they used that momentum and kept their game going today,” junior forward Elizabeth Weisman said. “They’re young, but they’re really determined to play well together and work really well together. They’re always talking to the coaches to figure out how they can get better. And they’ve gotten dramatically better as the season’s gone on.”
The game initially looked reminiscent of several games early this season—with Harvard’s slow start and inability to finish chances. But the second half would be a completely different story.
In the 50th minute, sophomore Mai Le dribbled into the box and rifled a shot past Holy Cross goalkeeper Ashlyn Angell and into the top left corner for her first goal of the season.
Le would assist on Casscells-Hamby’s goal 15 minutes later, when Casscells-Hamby headed the ball in off Le’s cross for her team-leading sixth goal of the year.
The scoring didn’t stop there. Weisman scored on a header off of one of senior midfielder Aisha Price’s patented long throw-ins in the 71st minute, and senior forward Alexandra Conigliaro connected for her first score of the year in the 84th minute on a shot from 18 yards out to put the game away for good.
And the Crimson seems to be rounding into form, heading into the homestretch of the Ivy League season.
“What’s really been working for us the past few games is just having fun and taking the pressure off ourselves,” Kanten said. “We’re playing soccer how we want to play—just passing well, sharing the ball, and shooting well.”
Kanten also put forth an explanation for the disparity between the team’s first and second half offensive output.
“At the beginning of the game you’re hyped up, and there’s a lot of adrenaline,” Kanten said. “After a while, you settle into the game and realize: ‘Now we need to start playing and scoring goals.’ It’s great that we’re scoring a lot, but I think it’s also important that we focus on scoring goals in the first half because that’s important for setting the tone in games.”
Harvard is planning to use this momentum as it prepares for its showdown with first-place Princeton on Saturday.
“We’re really excited that we’ve kept this winning momentum going and we’re looking forward to doing that again this weekend,” Weisman said. “If we play the way we’ve been playing, the goals will come and I know we’ll do well.”

Survival was the name of the game, as Harvard held on to beat Boston University in a dramatic, 2-1 double-overtime finish at Nickerson Field Tuesday night. After ending regulation play locked in a 1-1 tie, the Crimson (2-7-3, 0-2-1 Ivy) finally came through to secure the win against the Terriers (4-6-4, 1-1-2 America East).
Senior forward Zack Wolfenzon’s game winner came as a relief for Harvard, which struggled all night under a barrage of offensive firepower from BU. Wolfenzon capitalized on a cross from junior forward Connor McCarthy and found the back of the net in the 106th minute of play, handing the Crimson its second win of the season.
“We have had our fair share of games where we outplayed the other team and ended up losing,” Wolfenzon said. “We figured we just needed to keep holding on, keep working, and it would come.”
Harvard came away with the win despite being offensively outmatched in shots, shots on goal, and corner kicks. Freshman goalkeeper Evan Mendez was a major contributor to the effort, notching eight saves in his sixth start of the season to keep the Crimson within striking distance the entire game.
“BU had really good possession of the ball, but they were also vulnerable on the counterattack,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “We absorbed a lot of pressure, but our back line helped us out a lot until we got offensive chances. Goals are what matter, not shots and corner kicks.”
Both teams struggled offensively in the first half, and the score remained 0-0 heading into halftime. The Crimson recorded just one shot on goal in the period.
But Harvard picked up offensive momentum after the break, scoring the first goal of the game in the 49th minute. Freshman forward Oliver White, who came into the game near the end of the second half, headed the ball past the Terriers’ goalkeeper Nick Thompson off a free kick from 30 yards out. It was White’s third goal of the season, which puts him atop his team’s offensive leaderboard.
“Coach Junot has been emphasizing just putting the ball in the back of the net in practice,” Wolfenzon said. “The way you practice is the way you play, and we [have been] scoring a lot in practice.”
Junot was pleased with Harvard’s offensive output and said that the work put in during practice appears to be paying off.
“We have been spending a lot of time in training on free kicks, so to score that way was encouraging,” Junot said. “The second goal was a counterattack, which we have also been working on. The key to having a good offense is to have the ability to execute, beginning to end. We did that tonight.”
BU’s first shot on goal did not come until the 47th minute, when sophomore forward Dominique Badji tried to power one past Mendez, who recorded a save on the play. But once the Terriers got going, the Crimson defense was hard pressed to keep them at bay.
The offensive advantage swung heavily in the direction of the Terriers, who earned 12 corner kicks and took 19 shots in the second half. Badji and sophomore forward Powell Parker led BU’s offense with a combined 15 shots, five on goal.
The Terriers’ offensive pressure paid off in the game’s 69th minute, when Badji drilled the ball into the net from 25 yards out for his third goal of the season.
“You just have to keep playing and keep believing that you are going to pull one out,” Wolfenzon said. “Mendez had a couple unbelievable saves that kept us in the game.”
Harvard ended the night with seven shots, dipping below its season average of 12 shots per game, but strong defense and goalkeeping compensated for the lack of offensive opportunities.
“Richard Smith at center back was tremendous tonight, just making last ditch saves in front of the goal,” Junot said. “We showed a lot of grit and determination to get the result.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeremy Lin ‘10 stumbled in his preseason debut for the Houston Rockets this week, averaging 5.3 points per game and shooting 21.1 percent in three games. Last season, Lin averaged 14.6 ppg and shot 44.6 percent from the field, and he has attributed the week’s underwhelming performance to his ongoing recovery from knee surgery.
“My speed and my explosiveness and my agility [are not] there yet,” Lin told the New York Daily News after Houston’s 95-75 win over the New Orleans Hornets on Friday.
Nevertheless, questions about Lin’s athleticism have provided fodder for the New York media. The Rockets went 2-1 with Lin in the line-up this week, defeating the Thunder and Hornets on Wednesday and Friday, respectively, before falling to the Spurs on Sunday. Lin did not play in the Rockets’ 123-104 loss to the Mavericks on Monday.
Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05 and the Buffalo Bills (3-3) eked out an upset overtime victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. The Amish Rifle threw for 153 yards, zero touchdowns and zero interceptions before Rian Lindell booted a 25-yard field goal to clinch a 19-16 win on the road. The game was a homecoming of sorts for Fitzpatrick, who grew up in Gilbert, Ariz., and guided Highland High School to an Arizona Fiesta Region championship as a junior. In the end, few overtime heroics were required of Fitzmagic as Arizona’s Jarius Byrd yield his second interception of the game to provide the Bills with ideal field position to chip in the decisive points.
As the NHL lockout drags into its second month, Craig Adams ’99 of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Dominic Moore ’03, who played for the San Jose Sharks last season, have probably had some input into recent collective bargaining talks. The former Crimson hockey stars are both members of the 31-player NHL Players’ Association negotiating committee. Adams and other signed players would have received their first of thirteen NHL paychecks on Monday had the season started on time. Moore is still an unrestricted free agent and may sign with his 10th different NHL team in nine seasons once a new CBA is in place.

Last week's Arts cover focuses on the intersection of tattoo artists and their human canvases. Despite the cultural and aesthetic importance of tattoos, an informal survey of the internet suggests that people are just as interested (if not more so) in terrible tattoos rather than great ones. There are dozens of websites devoted to collecting misspelled, ugly, or strange pieces, usually complimented by snarky one-liners. So, for a change of pace, here's a brief defense of some of the worst offenders.
 
1. Your significant other's name. 
Tattoos are forever, just like your love. And if not, then there's a pretty good chance you'll meet another "Jennifer," and when you do, you'll have the perfect icebreaker. 
 
2. A "tramp stamp."
 I've never understood why people get so riled up about these. They're easy to hide when your Grandma comes around, and just as easy to reveal when she finally goes home and the rager can start up again. Everyone wins. 
 
3. Lion, tiger, or bear face tattoo.
Come Halloween, you're the coolest guy around. Come Christmas, you still are. You've got a freaking face tattoo. 
 
4. Marilyn Monroe portrait.
Megan Fox did it. Thus, it's hot. Extra points for turning it into a face tattoo. 
 
5. The mythical "Penicorn."
Actually, you'll probably regret this one. 
 
6. "Nintendo" knuckle lettering.
If you're a hardcore nerd, people are going to find out about it. It can either be when you have an asthma attack at a school dance, or it can be when they see your sweet knuckle ink. Which would you rather?
 
7. A phrase in another language whose meaning you just barely grasp. 
Mystery is important to keep a relationship interesting. This principle applies even more so when the relationship is between you and the skin on your ribcage.

In an effort to encourage Harvard students to emulate the upstanding young men and women pictured on the school's brochures, the Cabot dining hall has created a poster to remind people to stop leaving their grill orders unattended.
The "Stop the Grill Orders Left Behind" initiative, part of the Resource Efficiency Program's (REP) Food Waste Audit Week, posts the total number of grill items left behind each day. The wall was put up last week and on its first day reduced the number of abandoned orders from several to just one—a lonely, unclaimed dish of scrambled eggs.
"The Resource Efficiency Program is here to make these little daily actions easier for students, and if we can create a 'pause' moment that leads to reduced food waste, I would consider it a great success," said Cabot Eco-Rep Isabella A. Wechsler '13.
"I think we often read the news about what's going on with environmental changes at large, and resource depletion can seem like an impossibly big and overwhelming issue. REP really tries to be imaginative about this and to empower students to realize how much control they have over their own resource use."
CORRECTION: Oct. 18, 2012
The Oct. 17 post "Cabot Introduces "Wall of Shame'" incorrectly referred to the initiative as the "Wall of Shame" and suggested that people's names are posted when they leave grill items behind. The initiative is actually called "Stop the Grill Orders Left Behind." As well, no names are posted. At the end of the day, only the number of grill items left behind is displayed.

Last night's second presidential debate was decidedly more exciting than the first, and although political pundits will slice and dice the evening on a minute-by-minute level, here's Flyby's recap of last night's showdown.
 
Biggest difference between this debate and the first one: No, it wasn't the town hall format. The first debate had virtual no shows from President Obama and moderator Jim Lehrer. This time around, however, Obama aggressively went after opponent Mitt Romney, while moderator Candy Crowley was quick to cut off long-winded answers and at one point even acted as fact-checker.
 
Some buzz words: Middle class (30 mentions); China (21); deficit (18); education (14); tax cut (8); assault weapons (7); Planned Parenthood (4).
 
The use of the phrase "Not true": Obama, 9. Romney, 0.
 
Poor Lorraine Osario: Romney mispronounced her name. Then, a couple minutes later, so did Obama.
 
Bigger isn't always better: According to Romney, "[The Republican] party has been focused on big business too long…everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses." At another point in the evening, Romney asked Obama if he ever looked at his pension, to which the president responded, "You know, I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours, so it doesn't take long." Focusing on the smaller things in life?
 
Most politically confounding moment: In response to a question asking Romney to differentiate himself from former President George W. Bush, Romney strongly disavowed the Bush's policies on energy, trade, the budget, and small business. A few minutes later, Obama's answer ended up showing some support for Bush's policies on health care, immigration reform, and Planned Parenthood. Too bad no one thought to play Adele's "Turning Tables."
 
Most sound byte-able: "They brought us whole binders full of women." –Romney
"If we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should...go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers." -Obama
 
Honorable mention: The most infamous percentage of the election (the 47 percent) got a nod from Obama, and so did (you guessed it) Romney's favorite feathered friend over at PBS, Big Bird. Unfortunately, no mention of Elmo.
