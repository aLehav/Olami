Do you have a crush on Cersei, Drogon, or Bran? Want to know the best way to their heart? The show’s final season premiere was full of reunions and other intense encounters — let’s see what we can learn about the love languages of our favorite characters who haven’t died (yet).
Daenerys Targaryen: Words of Affirmation
During her journey from banished baby to badass dragon queen, we learned a few nicknames Daenerys likes to go by: Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains — just to name a few. Though many men have tried for their queen’s hand, it was only when Jon Snow gave the ultimate affirmation of calling Daenerys his “queen” that she truly fell for him. Now, all Queen Daenerys really wants from Sansa (and the rest of The North) is a similar declaration. Is that too much to ask?
Cersei Lannister: Gifts
Though Cersei may think Euron is insolent, he finally got to bed the queen (well, one of them) after getting her a few small gifts: the Sand Snakes, the entire Iron Fleet, and The Golden Company’s 20,000 men and 2,000 horses (but no elephants, disappointingly).
Yara Greyjoy: Acts of Service
Considering Yara spent the majority of Season 7 in the possession of her murderous uncle, Theon’s decision to axe a few people in the face and rescue his sister seemed to really mean a lot to her. She wasn’t even upset when Theon abandoned her while Euron was holding a knife to her throat — this made up for it all. Well, she still smacked Theon in the head with a brazen force, but that’s just how the Iron Islanders do it.
Dragons: Physical Touch
Jon is still pretty scared of his new girlfriend’s pets. Given that those pets are huge, fire-breathing beasts known to bring Jaime Lannister’s army to its knees, though, that’s fairly understandable. Last season, we saw Jon successfully touch Drogon (in other words, without getting burned alive), and in this episode, Jon rides a dragon for the first time. It seems the key to Drogon and Rhaegal’s hearts, then, is physical touch — totally not the fact that Jon is a secret Targaryen.
Bran Stark: Quality Time
Even though Bran may not be Bran anymore and is actually a creepy prophetic third-eyed bird, we still found some ways to win him over in the first episode of Season 8. Bran stayed out all night “waiting for an old friend,” whom, in the last few minutes of the episode, we discover to be Jaime Lannister — the man who pushed Bran out the window eight seasons ago hoping to cover his twincest with Cersei. Sure, we saw Arya reunite with Jon and Gendry this episode, but nothing tops these two spending Quality Time™ with one another.

“Yes She Can” is the uplifting collection of 10 stories by politically active young women who reveal what they went through to get to the White House during the Obama Administration. Before that, though, they all started off with a journey. Though all their explorations brought them to different places, they all have a very similar trajectory of hard work and dedication to their community.
Compiled by Molly Dillon, former policy assistant for Urban Affairs in the Domestic Policy Council from the Obama White House, each story in the collection contains a memorable anecdote from each staff member, detailing their journey up to this moment. The stories contain various challenges of working at the White House, from imposter syndrome, “[that] is an uninvited guest that will try to derail you,” to making a mistake. Readers experience the growth in each staffer’s life as they become more confident and better equipped for serving their various communities. No singular voice ties the book together. Instead it ebbs and flows into the transition for the next story, which ultimately leaves the impression of a sense of inspiration and hope for the future.
There is a strong prologue that places the reader directly in the “heels, but often… sensible flats too” of the staffers in the White House. The structure of the book keeps interest piqued throughout with a new story at the turn of the next page. Each narrative is long enough to give just enough context to understand their background and a well-rounded story of their time working in the Obama administration, but fewer, longer stories would have strengthened the book. Occasionally, the stories’ brevity leaves something to be desired. The book lacks a clear ending, and concluding with a letter written by all 10 contributing staffers may have better tied the stories together. However, a guide at the end of the book connects readers with the resources necessary to pursue a career or internship in public service. This is one of the most helpful parts of the book since it allows the reader to interact with the book directly.
Each story is captivating in its own way, reflecting Dillon’s care in curating stories that would allow a wide array of identities to be represented in the book. Some staffers were first-generation college students or immigrants, while others grew up immersed in politics and community organizing. Their journeys twist and turn: The writers point out how they never imagined working in the White House, and the staffers discuss their inspiration to work for their community, each sharing a personal tie to the significance of public service. The staffers’ voices shine through their style of writing as well. The stories are conversational and presented in a way that is easily understandable while containing personal touches that make these stories relatable.
“Yes She Can” illustrates the various career paths one may take in a public service role, but it also reads like a personal coffee chat with an old friend. Each story sets up the context for their background and the various challenges that they faced growing up. They share their struggles and their victories as well as the wonderful people that characterized their time at the White House. Each story is careful to recognize the individuals and settings that surround them, an attentiveness that enhanced the ability to engage with the full reality of working at a place like the White House.
“Yes She Can” is a great read for those who are interested in public service but are discouraged by the lack of representation. These stories are a reminder that the political landscape is changing for the better. This book shows that an individual’s background, identity need not hinder a public service career because public service just requires the desire to help. Each story in this collection is wildly different from the other, but they all share the same thread: hope.

Ally Condie’s most recent novel, “The Last Voyage of Poe Blythe,” finds a female hero in a world that is dark, muddy, and desperate. The novel is set around a precarious dystopian commune named the Outpost where the social order seems to depend on a constant supply of gold, the pursuit of which requires perilous quests upon armored boats out beyond the safety of the Outpost’s walls. These unfamiliar territories lead to violent clashes with river raiders, a group of vigilantes who will stop at nothing to intercept the Outpost’s mining ships. The novel’s protagonist, Poe Blythe, once undertook one of these journeys and lost the person she treasured the most, her lover Call, at the hands of the raiders. From that moment onward, Poe is fixated with undertaking vengeance on the raiders. In the novel, Condie traces Poe’s journey, both physical and internal, as she once again comes face to face with the river raiders, this time as captain of the ship. As their mining quest falls apart however, Poe begins to realize there is much more to the Outpost than she first expected, and Condie compellingly depicts Poe’s emotional transition from grief to hope, as new understandings may finally allow her to move past tragedy.
Condie’s novel, though focused primarily on a teenager, aims to tackle notably adult themes. The entire text is richly morose as Condie attempts to capture the aftershocks of a tragic loss from within the mind of Poe Blythe. As such, the novel is very much an internal narrative, heavy with saccharine yearnings for Poe’s lost lover: “Call. I have missed you. More than I can say. Or breathe. Or live.” Poe’s constant longing for Call, though melodramatic, is compelling in its youthful angst. Its proclamatory style, in its performative vigor, undeniably aims to satisfy the romantic appetites of teenage readers, who can latch onto her arduous journey down the river through the constant flow of bittersweet memories recalling days gone by.
Indeed, memories of mellow smut between the doomed couple are the essential lighthearted counterpart to a depiction of society that is surprisingly technical. The Outpost, and the bureaucracy surrounding it, is filled with jargon that, at times, can feel excessive. Every associated character or event has some capital-letter title: “the Admiral,” “the Quorum,” “the Desertion.” The reader must grapple with an overload of concepts, explained with varying levels of clarity. This terminology is coupled with lengthy functional descriptions of the ship, such as a particularly dreary passage about “a rectangular protrusion called the tailing stacker that just out at the back of the ship. It’s high above the river and a constant stream of tailings, or slicken — rock and debris — cascades out of it as long as the dredge is mining.” Such passages are more reminiscent of a seventh-grade geography lesson than a breathless YA novel, and such technical language is strikingly cumbersome in a broadly lyrical text.
Still, despite these stumbles, in her commitment to seriousness, Condie achieves a sense of dramatic tension which undoubtedly will strike a chord with younger audiences. The author’s stylistic habit of using short sentences to add drama, at its worst seems overblown (one dramatic description of a dessert comes to mind: “He’s carrying a cake. A ridiculous, towering white cake. Something so frivolous and rare… …But somehow, he managed it.”), but at its best, forces the reader into the moment: “‘Poe,’ he said. We were both breathing hard. ‘I was dreaming. I was kissing you.” Indeed, in creating a character as convincing as Poe, the reader is genuinely invested in her romantic progress, and despite any narrative inconsistencies, Poe’s gentle drift from her tragic loss to a newly blossoming romance orients the reader throughout the novel.

Apart from having starred in separate seasons of “Arrested Development,” the lead actors of “Long Shot” don’t have much in common. One is known for being one of the most talented and beautiful actresses in the world, and the other, her unlikely match, is known for being, well, Seth Rogen. The main selling point of Jonathan Levine’s “Long Shot” is the surprising juxtaposition of its two leads, Rogen’s Fred Flarsky and Charlize Theron’s Charlotte Field. This “average guy falls in love with a hot girl” story has been told time and time again, but “Long Shot” comes with a twist: The hot girl in question is the current Secretary of State and a presidential candidate, and the average guy is… still just average, or so it seems. While this small twist alone may not be enough to make this romantic comedy stand out, the consistently spot-on humor and the surprising chemistry between Rogen and Theron certainly do.
At the start of the film, Fred and Charlotte live in completely different worlds. Fred must quit his job after his newspaper is bought out by corrupt billionaire Parker Wembley (Andy Serkis), and Charlotte is the brilliant and well-regarded Secretary of State under former TV actor President Chambers (Bob Odenkirk). Charlotte’s world changes, however, when Chambers decides that he wants to bring his career to the next level — to film acting, that is — and endorses Charlotte for the presidency in 2020. There’s just one hitch: Voters don’t think she’s funny enough.
That’s where Fred comes in. When the two lock eyes across a “Boyz II Men” themed charity event, Charlotte recognizes Fred as a boy she used to babysit. The two shared a very awkward and stiff (pun intended) moment when they last saw each other years ago, but now she sees the hilarious Fred as the key to rejuvenating her humorless reputation. Charlotte offers Fred a position as her speechwriter, and thus begins one of the greatest developments of romantic tension in cinematic history. “Long Shot” thrives on its slow build-up — whenever one might think the first kiss is on the horizon, they will probably be wrong. Ultimately, it takes a tour of several countries, an aurora borealis sighting, and the near-death experience of a terrorist attack in Moscow for the two to express their feelings for one another. But when they fall for each other, they fall hard.
It is refreshing to see a couple fall in love without all the awkward and time-wasting hesitation endemic to so many other romantic comedies. From the moment they first kiss, Fred and Charlotte are not ashamed or confused by their feelings. The primary obstacle in this film, then, is not typical relationship drama — there’s no cheating, lying, or loss of interest — but the public opinion Charlotte must face as a highly-scrutinized figure. As Charlotte’s coworker Maggie (June Diane Raphael) so astutely points out through an analogy, “The public would have a pretty negative reaction to Kate Middleton dating Danny DeVito.” Movies have certainly forced their protagonists to choose between their career and love before, but usually the career in question is not the presidency. The way Charlotte manages the high stakes of her personal choices and her public life with her down-to-earth relationship with Fred makes this film particularly intriguing. And of course, since politics are involved, there are plenty of chances for Levine to humorously take shots at Republicans, billionaires, misogynists, and Republican-billionaire-misogynists along the way.
Interestingly, the film isn’t just about love and politics. One surprising but heartwarming development Levine explores in “Long Shot” is Fred’s journey toward self-acceptance. At the start of the film, Fred is fully aware of his flaws and always makes self-deprecating jokes. Over the course of his relationship with Charlotte, however, he learns that there are so many sides of him worth loving. In fact, by the end of the film, Fred has adopted “I am worthy of love” as a mantra. By telling the often overlooked story of finding confidence in one’s self, “Long Shot” sets itself apart from every other “average guy falls in love with a hot girl” movie. This is a love story that’s not just about loving another person, but loving oneself, too.
Of course, the second word in “romantic comedy” is just as important as the first. Rest assured, the film is packed with jokes. Unfortunately, much of this humor is dependent on a viewer’s knowledge of specific early ‘90s pop culture references — at many points it’s clear that the film is aimed toward the generation that grew up watching “Beverly Hills, 90210” and listening to “It Must Have Been Love” from “Pretty Woman.” In addition, the whiplash-inducing transitions between the romantic and comedic moments can be a little extreme — the transitions between a reflective and tender moment to an uncomfortably sexual webcam blackmail scene, for example, is particularly jarring. Still, the film gives viewers plenty of chances to genuinely laugh, especially if they feel secondhand embarrassment.
Levine takes a pretty standard premise and twists it at every chance it gets. While certainly not groundbreaking, it is refreshing to see a romantic comedy that actively tries to stand out from so many clichéd ones. Though the film’s novelty alone may not be enough to make it worth seeing, the chemistry between its leads certainly is. “Long Shot” requires a lot of suspension of disbelief — especially with regards to how the presidency works, how hostage situations are handled, and how voters treat female public figures, for example — but there’s one important thing that is perfectly easy to believe: the love between Fred and Charlotte.

UPDATED: April 23, 2019 at 9:06 p.m.
Since age three, actor, producer, director, and playwright Ali L. Astin ’19 has traversed the world of film and theater at full force. As the daughter of “Lord of the Rings” actor Sean Astin, who portrays Samwise Gamgee, Ali Astin’s first performance was alongside her father in “The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.” Throughout her time at Harvard, Astin has not only taken part in over 20 productions, but has also become the first of her star-studded family to pursue a formal education in acting, concentrating in Theater, Dance and Media. The Crimson sat down with Astin to talk about being a baby hobbit, her multifaceted role in the world of film and theater, and her philosophy on self-advocacy in art.
The Harvard Crimson: What was it like performing in high-profile productions like “The Lord of The Rings: Return of the King” at such a young age?
Ali Astin: It was such a blast because I literally grew up in a fantasy world — all of my friends had magical powers. That gave me this kind of whimsy when doing stuff that I think, whenever I'm doing even most serious role, I am having a blast. I also found that the highest profile things have the closest-knit, most down-to-earth people, which is really cool.
THC: Despite coming from a long line of extremely successful professional actors, you are the first in your family to formally study acting. [Ed. Note: After publication, The Crimson learned that Astin was not the first in her family to formally study acting. Her grandfather John Astin graduated from John Hopkins University with a Bachelor of Arts in Drama.] How has this distinction impacted you?
AA: My dad called me the other day because he had his first stage production, and he couldn't figure out how to memorize that many lines. I realized in that moment that, even though everyone in my immediate family has won or been nominated for an Oscar, I'm the only one who knows how to memorize lines for a full play. In relation to my dad, it was cool to be able to be the authority [on acting] for a minute. I think I get to find my own way in a way that my father never got to: I can create the theater I want to be doing.
THC: In the brief biography you emailed to The Crimson, you expressed the belief that “the actor in 2019 isn't simply an actor at all, they're a jack of all trades and an active advocate for their own art and that's precisely what I've become.” What about film, theater, or the world in general do you believe has caused the actor to become so versatile?
AA: There used to be an idea that you can be either a theater actor or a film actor. Now, I think the world has made it so that anything is possible, which means that you have to be ready for anything. It used to be as simple as, ‘When the phone rings, I'll nail the audition.’ And now... the phone may ring every day for a week, but you can't be satisfied with waiting for it. I would go stir-crazy if I spent a day not creating something new. I did my thesis on playwriting when I had never been a playwright, and I realized that it's all just different sides of the same stone. Anything can happen, so you want to be excited about anything and everything.
THC: How do you advocate for your own art?
AA: Growing up, I was around a lot of publicists who help figure out what your brand is. Now, that doesn't exist. People just want you to be who you are. You need to be able to be really authentic. Then, you need to realize that every other person who's excited about art is excited about their own art. So for them to be excited about you, you have to have something special that you think is worth sharing every chance you get. That kind of hustling for yourself is the only way anyone's ever going to get as excited about yourself as you are.
THC: What work do you foresee yourself pursuing in the near future? What about later in life — do you have any sort of end goal?
AA: In the immediate future, I see myself acting in as much TV and film as I can. Then, every second I'm not doing that, I'll be promoting my own theatre work. In the far future, I would love to have a production company where I can be creating works of art across platforms. I think that a lot of projects only get to see the light of day in one medium. I love the idea of maybe someday integrating a project so that it could have a life on stage simultaneously as it is on screen, and simultaneously as it is an art installation in downtown New York.

The hypnotic appeal of young adult fiction continuously coaxes the masses into buying more angsty John Green novels or dystopian volumes about world-saving teens. Every few years, a particular book or series will reach astronomical popularity, ushering a new obsession and spawning dozens of rip-offs that want to cash in on the trend. Over the past decade, the YA genre has survived a number of brief, yet intensely fanatical, periods of fixation over wizards, vampires, violent dystopias, and terminal illnesses. Each time, we swear that “It’s not a phase, Mom!” while clutching Team Jacob shirts or Mockingjay pins but alas, we’re wrong: It’s always a phase. Get ready to cringe on this trip down memory lane, because this top five probably features a slew of your favorite books from middle school.
5. “The Fault in Our Stars” by John Green
John Green may be designated as Supreme Author of Teen Angst, but a closer look at his body of work reveals that he tends to simply reproduce similar characters and story arcs in different settings. Quirky girl with some hidden tragedy meets quirky boy who wants to break down her walls. Love ensues, then sadness. If you read Green’s earlier books like “Looking for Alaska” and “Paper Towns,” the formula should’ve become fairly tedious by the time he wrote “The Fault in Our Stars.” As a middle-schooler, “The Fault in Our Stars” was the kind of book that made you feel understood, given that all its characters are just as moody and self-important as you surely were at the time. Sure, it’s obnoxious that Hazel Grace and Gus talk to each other in a superbly lofty, philosophical manner that no real teens would actually use, but that probably didn’t keep you from crying when Gus died. Probably.
4. “City of Bones” by Cassandra Clare
The premise of “City of Bones” is that Clary Fray, an ordinary high school student, discovers herself to be a Shadowhunter — a race of part-angel, part-human warriors that are granted powers by their magical tattoos and protect the world from demons. Just like hundreds of other YA writers, Clare tries to frame Clary as a “strong female lead” and fails miserably, making the character intolerable. Clary’s supposedly feisty temper comes off as petulant and obnoxious, given that she’s a newbie Shadowhunter who lacks both authority and combat ability, yet constantly demands that others help clean up the messes that she herself causes. Moreover, every other line in this novel is a joke or innuendo that reeks of middle school humor, and it’s rather hard to take the plot seriously if characters are supposedly quipping at each other in the midst of battle, over the sounds of weapons clashing and opponents dying.
3. “Twilight” by Stephenie Meyer
Vampires and werewolves and an annoying Mary Sue, oh my! “Twilight” is a novel that fails to meet both moral and artistic standards — what can you expect when the act of a century-old vampire breaking into a teenage girl’s home and watching her sleep is construed as romance? Moreover, the heroine, Bella Swan, deems herself a generally awkward and plain girl, yet is swarmed with kids who desperately want to befriend her and snags the attention of one of the most beautiful, popular boys (hint: he might be a vampire) on her first day at a new school. Come on, this is blatantly a work of fantasy fulfillment. Skip “Twilight” if you’re looking for healthy relationship advice, but if you want to learn a slew of synonyms for “sparkling,” Meyer has you covered with her numerous, increasingly odd descriptions of reflective vampire skin.
2. “The Selection” by Kiera Cass
“The Selection” is marketed as an edgy mashup of “The Bachelor” and “The Hunger Games,” and while the novel certainly features a lot of televised crying, backstabbing, trash-talking, and teen girls tearing each other down to vie for the love of a prince they just met, the dystopian aspect is limited. Sure, there are periodical reminders of a shortage of makeup, perhaps even a lack of food, and a poorly explained caste system, but the protagonist is primarily concerned with portraying the love triangle between America Singer, one of the girls chosen to compete for the prince’s hand; Maxon Schreave, the awkwardly charming prince; and Aspen Leger, America’s childhood flame. But wait, isn’t there an unfair government and a society in shambles that should be analyzed? Nope, the flimsy world-building of “The Selection” would fall apart under that level of scrutiny.
1. “After” by Anna Todd
The film adaptation of this One Direction fanfiction came out on April 12, so it’s best that you get fair warning about the content beforehand. Remember how One Direction was really just Harry Styles and the Other Guys? Well, Anna Todd obviously felt the same way, because a fictionalized version of Harry takes the spotlight in “After” as the brooding, tattooed bad boy who becomes the love interest of the goody-two-shoes protagonist, Tessa. Given that this work is targeted towards a young tween audience and that it has amassed over ten million views on Wattpad, an online writing platform, you’d expect the story to be wholesome and maybe even well-written. Wrong — “After” is an amalgam of problematic themes that romanticizes abusive relationships, normalizes slut-shaming, promotes hatred between women — the list goes on.

As we all rewatch the past seasons of “Game of Thrones” to prepare for the highly anticipated release of the series’ final premiere, let’s take a moment to appreciate Cersei Lannister (since she certainly isn’t the recipient of much love). She’s the queen of double-crossing people, having deadly vendettas, and loving her family a bit too much. However, she’s an empowered woman (the first to be on the Iron Throne) and skilled politician who absolutely owns her sexuality, as well as a loving mother willing to go to major extremes for her children. So get an ice pack for this hot take because it’s time to start liking Cersei.
Starting from the beginning of Cersei’s transition to the seemingly heartless woman she is, the show introduces a young girl who is constantly told that because of her gender, she can’t achieve anything. This plot humanizes Cersei and her ascent to the Iron Throne, especially with these odds set against her from her youth.
Cersei sets out ready to find success from a young age. Her stoic reaction to Tommen’s death and her accession to the Iron Throne show that she wouldn’t settle for anything less. If only Harvard students could have this type of sustained motivation throughout the school year, we’d all be bankers at Goldman right now.
Cersei represents a strong and independent female character who has managed a large feat on television: to be heard. It’s not often you see a female character who holds a dominant position over males while simultaneously controlling an army, running council meetings, and so forth. In no way is Cersei just the widow of King Robert or sister to Tyrion. She’s more than queen regnant or even her most recent title, Queen Cersei of the House Lannister, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. If you try, you can most likely empathize with Cersei.
In no way is this a loving endorsement of Cersei. It’s difficult to root for a character who wants to see the demise of everyone viewers care about, but it’s necessary to recognize that Cersei isn’t a heartless soul.
While Cersei falters in some moral aspects such as her incestuous acts and baseless murder, there is a method to her madness. As the victim of abuse, torment, and neglect for much of her childhood, it’s reasonable to expect her to be the new Mad Queen.

As a spacesuit-clad Robert Pattinson is poised delicately in the void of deep space, his silent suspension is a fitting emblem for a transfixing opening scene. With a giant wrench in hand, he carefully works to secure a bolt on the spaceship’s exoskeleton while communicating via microphone with his infant daughter, who is inside. He whispers to her, “Dada.” Her gurgled “Dada” in response breaks the radio silence of the void and grows into an excruciating wail. When he tries to hush her, his hands falter for a moment, the wrench slips away, and he watches as it sinks slowly, eerily into the void. French filmmaker Claire Denis has graced cinema once again with her singular cosmic thriller, “High Life,” her first-ever English-language feature film. Fusing the abject and the sublime with stunning sleights of hand, Denis crafts a unique vision of deep space in this deliciously disturbing must-see.
Leave it to Denis, often celebrated as a true auteur, to pioneer a new way to direct the cinematic gaze toward outer space. Denis’ cosmos needs none of that atmospheric sound so dear to science fiction directors to demonstrate its terrifyingly vacuous expanse. What is perhaps more impressive, “High Life” inverts the traditional plot of the sci-fi flick, beginning with the aftermath of an ill-fated mission to the far reaches of the universe. Monte, played by a masterful Robert Pattinson, and his infant daughter (Scarlett Lindsey) are the last survivors on board a dilapidated spaceship that is hurtling towards a black hole. Through a series of flashbacks, the film recounts how the crew, made up entirely of death row inmates and led by a perverse doctor, reached the point of self-destruction. Murder, suicide, and ill health made the passengers a dying breed aboard an eroding tin can. Amidst the sex, blood, test tube babies, and brutalism, “High Life” is a winking meditation on what humanity ought to fear most: its own capacity for evil.
Denis is a faithful genre-bender, and although she does not consider “High Life” a sci-fi movie, it is certainly in a provocative dialogue with many of the genre’s tropes. By injecting these clichéd structures with all the messiness of carnal desire and taking the time to explore the strangeness of human displacement, Denis has revitalized the genre. In her able hands, the prototypical evil scientist transforms into the sexy, baby-crazed Dr. Dibs, who, of course, calls dibs on the semen of every man aboard the ship. Her obsession with all matters of the flesh is reminiscent of the sexual cannibals in Denis’ 2001 film “Trouble Every Day.” Juliette Binoche plays Dr. Dibs with an appallingly clear-sighted singularity of purpose. She moves effortlessly from a wild ride on a mechanized dildo — the chief amusement of the ship’s oft-used “fuckbox” — to a sinister execution of her fertility experiments. By collecting the semen of the men on board and injecting it into the women, Dibs attempts to manufacture a reproductive society. If the fetuses survive long enough to be born, however, the babies quickly die from radiation. Dibs finally looks to the healthy, noble-natured Monte to solve the problem of ship-wide infertility –– only, Monte refuses to contribute his seed to the experiments. Nicknamed “the Monk” by the other crew members, he is decidedly asexual and certainly does not use the “fuckbox.” Like a long-haired succubus, Dibs preys on a sedated Monte one night, raping him to collect his semen. She injects it into Boyse (Mia Goth), a wild-child murderess who, after giving birth to a healthy baby girl, flies solo into a neighboring black hole to her death.
The film rewrites the conventional cosmic adventure story with a wonderfully unrelenting, subversive strain. In the first place, there is the all-important space mission: that great, life-threatening undertaking for the benefit of humanity. Denis makes a playground of this sci-fi ideal, as her crew is not comprised of illustrious NASA heroes. Instead, they are a not-so-merry band of hardcore miscreants. The government offered these death row inmates a choice: Stay on Earth and await your death in prison, or serve your country in a doomed mission to deep space. They are considered the scum of the earth, and they are being duly recycled. Their new prison is one of the most unsexy, non-futuristic spaceships in cinematic history — a sort of concrete block with rust around the edges. Their new sentence is death by black hole oblivion.
However bleak this vision of space exploration, Denis treats her subjects with a sensuousness that tempers the film’s brutalism. “High Life” is awash with sympathetic close-ups that work to capture the subjectivities of even the most morally obscene characters. For a film that traffics so heavily in the taboo, there is a sustained note of tenderness struck chiefly by Robert Pattinson’s remarkable performance. As Monte, he has all the thoughtfulness that his characteristically heavy eyebrows suggest, but, beyond that brooding quality, he is also a wonderfully generous actor. Some of the film’s best moments are understated scenes of intimacy between Monte and his daughter, which stand out like pockets of redemption in a grotesque underworld. The baby girl, aptly named Willow, springs like a beacon of renewal from a ship submerged in moral degeneracy. It is ultimately Monte and Willow’s relationship that has enough staying power to survive the black hole. In a tantalizingly ambiguous final scene, a bar of golden light spreads over the picture. It is as if double doors have opened, allowing father and daughter to enter into an effluence of light that can only be described as the site of the supreme taboo: What lies beyond the void, if anything?

A modern day thriller interspersed with humorous monologues and dream sequences, “Tone-Deaf” is certainly entertaining. In “Tone-Deaf,” Robert Patrick takes on a new leading role compared to his previous productions, as an unstable and recently widowed man named Harvey who struggles with dementia. Patrick doesn’t disappoint. Left to his own devices after his wife’s suicide, Harvey has concluded that the last thing he needs to do before dying is to take someone else’s life. He begins his plan by advertising his house as a rental online, and the bait works. The first person to place an offer is Olive (Amanda Crew), a spoiled Millennial who books the rental in order to enjoy alone time and a much needed detox from her fast-paced city lifestyle. A mother on psychedelics and her daughter, who is by herself in a huge house with a mentally-declining old man, together make the perfect recipe for a discombobulated horror film. This film is a must-see in the same way that “Sharknado” or “The Human Centipede” are must-sees — purely for their shock value. However, in setting out to make a comedy-horror film, director Richard Bates Jr. ultimately does not succeed in balancing the film’s comedic beats and drama.
Olive is a typical 20-something working in a high-rise office space in Los Angeles under a churlish boss whom she absolutely despises, while dreaming of headlining as a pianist — her piano skills are abhorrent, but since no one has the heart to tell her so, she feeds her own delusional fantasies. Harvey is Olive’s polar opposite. He becomes obsessed with the prospect of killing someone because he feels that he has conquered all the other important milestones in life: graduating, getting married, having children. As Olive moves into his home, Harvey silently stalks her from his nearby cabin, where he rants and plots to murder her. Olive is a perfect victim: She represents everything Harvey despises, a caricature of the blissfully unaware and self-centered Millennial. Ironically, Harvey uses the technology that he so despises — putting his house on an Airbnb-style website to advertise it, researching Olive online through social media platforms, and so forth, suggesting that there isn’t that much of a generational gap between them. The hilarious rapport between the two characters is one of the few comedic highlights of the film.
The best parts of the film are the moments in which Harvey breaks the fourth wall to communicate with the audience. In his monologues, Harvey details the disappointment he feels towards his son, his hatred of new technology and of the sense of entitlement that seems to plague the millennial generation — all of which Patrick expresses with perfect gusto. His direct engagement with the viewer is definitely entertaining, but ultimately distracts the viewer from the absence of an original plot (a lonely and aimless man schemes to kill a young, unwitting girl).
While Harvey plots her murder, Olive remains blissfully unaware. She spends her time going on blind dates, purchasing LSD from a drug dealer who runs a faux car wash, and talking on the phone to her mother, who later (somewhat) comes to the rescue. The relationship between Olive and her mom is at best like a distant friendship, as Olive’s mom was absent throughout most of her childhood. She lives apart from Olive in her drug-induced hazes, so their eventual dramatic reunion serves as an out-of-place and rushed plot device.
The film’s ending is slightly disappointing and anticlimactic, due to the fact the viewer becomes accustomed to Harvey’s erratic and quirky behavior and might expect a dramatic showdown. Bates unfortunately does not tie up loose ends in the plot and neglects to provide proper closure to Harvey’s story. Harvey has enigmatic, hallucinatory dream sequences in his delirious state that seem important, since they recur constantly, but that Bates never explains or explores. In result, the viewer is left feeling needlessly bewildered. While it strives to be a hilarious thriller, “Tone Deaf” lacks the right balance of comedy and horror that is achieved in films like the “Scary Movie” series, for example. Aside from a snarky commentary on modern day politics, the film doesn’t offer much to think about, besides providing a few good laughs and an adrenaline rush.

“What is dead may never die,” as the Greyjoys say — and that is precisely the newest problem in Westeros. In the finale of the seventh season of HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” the White Walkers made their first appearance south of the Wall, putting the war between the living and the dead at the forefront of Season Eight. While the premiere aptly details the various challenges the characters must face before the series ends, there is now a levity that feels misplaced in what should be the darkest season.
The episode, “Winterfell,” begins with a mighty show of Daenerys Targaryen’s strength as she marches her Dothraki horde, Unsullied army, and two dragons to Winterfell. But this parade of power ends when Brandon Stark rudely interrupts Jon Snow — “We don’t have time for this,” he says — as Jon introduces his siblings to their new queen. Bran, who has been gradually becoming an prominent character following his complete absence in Season 5, is someone the writers of the show must be wary of. It is a tricky balancing act to have an all-knowing character who is both believed and trusted by those in power. At times, it is all too convenient to have someone reveal specific information at just the right moment. Already, they have toed the line: Bran informs Samwell Tarly that he must tell Jon his true parentage that very day, making this storyline feel propelled by convenience rather than circumstance. Just like those who fight the white walkers, the writers are playing with fire.
Perhaps the most stark (no pun intended) difference between this episode and those of the past is the degree of levity. There were always snarky jokes — often at the expense of the various characters who lack genitalia — but some moments felt more like scenes from sitcoms rather than a gritty HBO show. After Daenerys and Jon share a playful moment as he rides a dragon for the first time, they fly to a secluded spot where Jon says a string of bad pick-up lines, but medieval and much, much worse. While the two share a kiss, Jon peeks one eye open to see both dragons giving him the death stare, as if they were protective older brothers rather than giant, ferocious beasts. Although funny, the moment feels more like something from “How To Train Your Dragon,” and not in a good way.
Despite these flaws, the episode delivered what it needed to: a good layout of this season’s obstacles. For one, the tension between Daenerys and Sansa Stark is made abundantly clear. When Sansa complains in front of all the lords of the North that Winterfell does not have enough food to feed those who accompany Daenerys, she sneers, “What do dragons eat anyway?” to which Daenerys shoots back, “Whatever they want.” Sansa has already proven herself to be cunning and ambitious: “Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now,” Tyrion Lannister tells her. In spite of her family loyalties, it very well may be Sansa who undermines Daenerys for a chance to sit on the Iron Throne.
The army of the dead remains relatively unseen in this episode, a clever decision which allows tension to mount and for the focus to remain on the absolute chaos among the living as they constantly struggle to choose the future leader of the land. Furthermore, with fewer locations on the map comes many reunions. Jon returns to Winterfell to see Arya and Bran, whom he believed to be dead. Arya and Gendry rekindle their friendly rapport, which seems to include a hint of flirting now that they two are older. But perhaps most striking is the final scene in which Jaime Lannister, who comes North to fight against the dead as he promised, turns to see Bran — whom he pushed out of a window in the first episode of the series — sitting calmly in his wheelchair, staring right back at him.
Regardless of the sudden change in tone and Bran’s potential for dubious puppeteering of the plot, the episode promises an exciting final season. Most shocking of all, however, is that no one (of importance) died this time.

Female empowerment. Sexuality. The new era of women. Director Michael Engler tries to juggle all of these themes in “The Chaperone,” yet the film falls short of reaching its full potential. The audience delves into a lackluster story told through the lens of the titular chaperone named Norma Carlisle, who is played by Elizabeth McGovern, known for her role in the Emmy Award-winning show “Downton Abbey,” as she supervises Louise Brooks (Haley Lu Richardson) to New York to pursue a dancing career that eventually leads to her journey to becoming one of the most famous film stars in the world.
The story begins in the sleepy town of Wichita, Kansas, where affluent white people casually talk about joining the Ku Klux Klan. Louise as a character is unfortunately underused — a spark that Engler fails to ignite. In this film, McGovern plays a duller character than the others she has played in the past. Norma is an upper-class woman trapped in a loveless marriage whose decision to chaperone Brooks to New York stems from her own desire to find herself. Norma grew up in a strict religious orphanage before being adopted by farmers and then marrying into a wealthy and privileged family. Her main goal is to learn the identity of her birth parents and to contact them. Engler’s focus on Norma’s personal agenda distracts from Louise’s story, which should have been the focus of the film.
The film takes place during the Roaring Twenties, when various political and social changes across the United States brought about massive upheavals of conventional values. One can observe this cultural change in the dialogue, as characters discuss alcohol prohibition and the newly-granted rights of minorities and women. However, Engler downplays the further challenges and social issues women faced despite having attained the legal right to vote. Norma’s son exemplifies this overly-simplistic optimism when he says, “This is 1922, haven’t you heard? Things have changed. Women vote now, they can do whatever they want.”
“The Chaperone” is a coming-of-age film, but unfortunately one that spends too much time exploring Norma’s dull personal story rather than Louise’s. However, there are some redeeming moments when Louise and Norma have thought-provoking arguments about gender expectations and their differing cultural values. At one point, Norma tells Louise that “men don’t like candy that’s been unwrapped,” as Louise takes delight in toying with the feelings of city boys. While exhausting and repetitive at some points, scenes in which their worldviews conflict illustrate the social dynamics during this era of supposed female liberation. This is evident in a discussion that the two characters have about corsets. Norma sees it as the social norm to wear a corset, while Louise sees it as restricting. She is the absolute epitome of what the Roaring Twenties symbolizes: a woman who simply wants the freedom to do as she pleases.
When Carlisle travels to her old orphanage, a janitor named Joseph, played by Géza Röhrig, presents her with her birth records and soon becomes her romantic interest. This pairing is certainly a refreshingly unconventional one for this time period, as Carlisle is an older, married, and affluent woman in a budding extramarital relationship with a lower-class immigrant. As Norma and Joseph fall in love, she becomes more comfortable expressing what she wants. While Norma’s very slow personal journey is not interesting enough to carry the entire plot, Engler at least portrays it in a poetic way. In the beginning of the film, Norma’s strict belief in wearing a corset signifies her willingness to obey social norms, but at end of her trip to New York, Norma resolves to go without her corset, choosing to be free. In a way, the corset represents Norma’s rigidly traditional attitude, but the loosening of the strings and her removal of the corset signifies her newfound sense of independence.
Louise is bold, independent, and empowered — everything that Norma is not. This contrast between the characters sets them up for an unfortunately repetitive plot where Brooks acts out, Carlisle tightens her reins, and the cycle repeats. Louise unexpectedly becomes a side prop to advance Norma’s journey of self-discovery and isn’t given the opportunity to let Richardson’s charismatic acting shine. Engler should have provided a closer look into Louise Brooks’s fascinating rise to fame as a silent film star and her tragic fall from stardom once her personal problems got in the way of her career. In this film, however, Louise is no more than an afterthought in comparison to McGovern’s character. Engler would have made a more interesting film with a stronger plot if he had focused on Louise’s inspirational confidence and groundbreaking liberal attitudes instead of on the depressing and uninteresting plight of Norma Carlisle. By neglecting to develop any other character besides Norma, the film is like a poorly written episode of “Downton Abbey,” solely featuring McGovern and relying on the intriguing setting (in this case, the Roaring Twenties) to carry it through to the next episode.

Fashion and gender are inextricably linked. What we wear informs our notions of gender, and historically, gender has also controlled what we can and cannot wear. “Gender Bending Fashion,” a new exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, surveys the past century of Western haute couture and ready-to-wear fashion that has challenged and blurred the binary prescription of dress, featuring contemporary designers and sartorial icons in the context of the historical trends (and restrictions) that informed them. As the first major museum to address the intersection of fashion and gender, the exhibit has been lauded by Vogue, the Boston Globe, and the Art Newspaper as a showcase of “Western pop culture’s great moments of binary disruption.”
As someone who studies feminism and fashion, I desperately wanted to love this exhibit, too. There were parts of it that I did. The fact that it even exists is an achievement, and it features several deserving moments in fashion on visually striking holographic displays: One centerpiece, for example, was Christian Siriano’s acclaimed silk red evening suit for Janelle Monáe in 2018. The exhibit also ended in some of the up and coming designers that are working towards creating clothing that “will be designed for, and worn by, anybody."
But what the exhibit ultimately magnifies is the pervading whiteness and straightness of the fashion industry. The “gender bending” garments featured have predominantly been fashioned for white, cisgender, often heterosexual bodies who already have the privilege to explore the creative potential of “crossdressing” on the runway, rather than for bodies whose identities don’t fit within the prescribed gender binary that has been further perpetuated by fashion. That’s not to say that the former has been done in bad faith or does not deserve to be recognized, especially because these fashions were rightly seen as radical as their time. But we must acknowledge the white privilege that allows Tilda Swinton to be heralded an “androgynous icon,” especially when Viktor & Rolf’s 2003 “One Woman Show” inspired by and featuring her did not include a single person of color. If “gender bending” fashion and exhibits thereof stop at straight men wearing skirts and women wearing tuxedos — all the while capitalizing on BGLTQ symbols by making everything rainbow-themed and playing anthems like “Born this Way” by Lady Gaga and “PYNK” by Janelle Monáe — they run the risk of overlooking actual gender benders. The exhibit’s definitions of terms related to gender and sexuality — including the differenciation between the two —are a definite step in the right direction, but they inevitably feel misplaced when not followed with fashion that actually embodies these ideas.
Perhaps this shortcoming is more a reflection of the fashion industry than the exhibit itself — after all, some might argue that BGLTQ communities have only recently started to gain visibility in the public eye. The exhibit seems to be somewhat self-aware about its lacking representation: Halfway through, a small description notes that “The MFA began collecting clothing as early as 1899, but many art museums did not do so until mid-20th century… Marginalized groups — including queer and trans communities and communities of color — were rarely represented in mainstream institutions. As a result, fashion trends that originated in these communities have been obscured or erased, the garments themselves lost to history.” Still, the result is that garments like the single zoot suit featured — a baggy suit popularized among African American and Latino youth as a potent, political symbol in the ‘30s and ‘40s — and Jimi Hendrix’s floral jacket appear like tokens of diversity rather than integral players in challenging the norms of the fashion industry. Where is the representation of drag, for example, of which there exists plentiful and racially diverse gender bending fashion? Why was Rudi Gernreich, a gay rights activist who revolutionized unisex clothing in the 1960s, relegated once again to a mere two-garment feature, rather than made a focus?
“Gender Bending Fashion” appears to have magnified, rather than mitigated, the fault lines of the fashion industry. The exhibit’s existence is a hopeful start — but definitely not the end of fashion that challenges gendered conceptions of dress.

Picture this: a bleak, gray, empty leasing space — a consequence of the retail apocalypse — that has been repurposed to house a glitzy, colorful setup with larger-than-life props, designed solely as a backdrop for people to take pictures of themselves. It’s being marketed as a space to “capture your happy,” where patrons can buy seemingly perfect snapshots of themselves in a idyllic-looking world — pictures that they can later post on social media to advertise themselves as a fun-loving person with a happy, colorful life that you should also covet.
Is this the premise of an episode from the next season of “Black Mirror”? Nope. It’s actually Happy Place, a pop-up exhibit on Boston’s Boylston Street that boasts well-lit and colorful rooms filled with giant cookies, confetti, and gumball machines. A lemonade stand evokes nostalgia. Ebullient songs like Katrina and the Waves’ “Walking on Sunshine” and Kacey Musgraves’ “Biscuits” blare on surround-sound speakers to set the perfect mood for picture-taking orgies. And it’s all supposedly for the sake of making people happy.
With such a lofty mission statement, you might wonder how exactly Happy Place intends to achieve this goal. In the selfie-centric labyrinth of perfect lighting and charming props, it seems that Happy Place doesn’t necessarily allow you to feel happy. Instead, it limits you to create a facade of happiness — to merely look happy. And in an ironic twist, when only the latter is pursued, it’s more difficult to achieve the former.
A journey through Happy Place feels almost like a safari, in which you make a pit stop in every room to get a snapshot of the main attraction. Yet, what’s actually in the rooms is reduced to just being the background. The patrons’ strained smiles and seemingly carefree yet carefully planned poses are the true centerpieces of each image, and the props and lighting contribute to making the feigned happiness convincing. But even then, the only reason why the props can achieve this transcendence is because the inevitable imperfections of the exhibit — dinged-up walls, visible overhead vents and pipes, shades of industrial concrete gray — are deliberately filtered and cropped out of photos, as these blemishes would tarnish the pretense of happiness that visitors seek to portray.
There exists a palpable pressure on Happy Place’s visitors to ensure that the photos of themselves in front of eye-catching backdrops are something worth looking at. After the camera shutters close, smiles evaporate into cookie-scented air and heads quickly become glued to phones and cameras, thoroughly evaluating how well the pictures turned out — a testament to how this installation possesses little meaning in its own right. It’s up to patrons to fabricate a version of themselves that makes the allure of the space believable in order to garner likes from followers.
Happy Place is somewhat of a misnomer: It conflates genuine happiness with pictures that seem to convey it. The emphasis placed on appearing happy reflects the way in which creating a carefully curated, personal brand of happiness on social media has superseded the desire to find a more internal and less circumstantial notion of contentment that’s not intended to be on display.
At the end of the day, Happy Place is just an Instagrammable gold mine. So why should we be compelled to feel that places to take interesting-looking photos are to be equated with places of happiness? Just as you wouldn’t go to portrait studios thinking that you’re going to be much happier after, you also should not expect to leave Happy Place with a sense of fulfillment. It serves its purpose as a backdrop for Instagram photos, but falls short of its brightly advertised promises.
Even though taking photos at Happy Place is not a guarantee of happiness, it has certainly been designed to be irresistible. I, too, fell victim to the allure of the duck-filled wall that borders a bright yellow bathtub, and left with a few pictures myself. But you don’t leave with the more abstract things that are conducive to what makes our lives worth living, like moments of visceral understanding, meaningful conversations, and unstaged but joyful laughs with friends. The novelty of Happy Place is undoubtedly enticing, but ultimately unfulfilling.
And so I left Happy Place not feeling significantly happier, and with a little less storage on my phone from the photos that I would post to the ’gram later on. I shared a smiling bathtub image, and an amusing shot of someone’s sad-looking spilled Happy Place-branded M&M’s juxtaposed against a wall that showed the wear of daily visitors. This creative choice may have cost me some likes — but after spending an hour in a space dedicated to simulating perpetual happiness, sharing the nuances and imperfections of what’s real felt more satisfying than trying to portray a staged idyllic moment.

The Association of Black Harvard Women (ABHW) welcomed up-and-coming rapper Rico Nasty to campus on March 4. Known for her hit songs “Bitch I’m Nasty” and “Countin’ Up,” Rico Nasty joined ABHW for an on-campus discussion followed by a concert at The Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub in Cambridge.
The night’s events began with a question and answer session with the artist, moderated by ABHW’s Inclusivity Chair Morgan K. Ogryzek ’21. The discussion covered a variety of topics such as Rico Nasty’s artistic inspirations, son, target audience, and unconventional style. Themes of race, gender identity, black womanhood, beauty standards, and breaking boundaries permeated the conversation.
When asked what inspired her to start making music and her intended audience, Rico Nasty said, “I think what made me start doing music, generally, was just the idea of having an outlet, something or somewhere I can put all my emotions and not really get judged for it.” She explained that while many believe that she makes music specifically for women, she believes that her music can appeal to anyone who wants to have a good time.
After this conversation between Rico Nasty and Ogryzek, the discussion opened to questions from the audience. Audience members inquired about Rico Nasty’s makeup routine, her creative process, and the significance behind her various tattoos. The discussion with Rico Nasty concluded with a question on her favorite songs to perform and who she would like to collaborate with someday. After the discussion, the crowd, predominantly made up of black women, left buzzing with excitement.
The night’s events concluded with a performance by Rico Nasty and an after-party at the Middle East. After an opening set by Boston rapper Vintage Lee, Rico Nasty took the stage. She performed her popular songs “Tia Tamera” (a Doja Cat song that features Rico Nasty), “Smack A Bitch,” and “Rage” to a crowd of about 500 students from Harvard and other Boston universities. Rico Nasty’s set sparked a mosh pit and evoked loud cheering and rapping from the crowd. Many stayed after the concert for the after party, during which a DJ played songs ranging from popular hip-hop tracks to Caribbean reggae and dancehall songs.
After the show, audience member Shayla L. LeBlanc ’21 said, “The show was amazing! I've been a fan of Rico for years and I've seen her three times in less than a year! I lost my voice after rapping every single song she played; it was such a high-energy show and amazing experience.”
After the concert, Kacey E. Gill ’20, the president of ABHW, discussed planning the discussion and concert, the success of the event, the significance of Rico Nasty’s appearance at Harvard, and ABHW’s future.
Gill explained that ABHW planned the event after recognizing that few social spaces and events are targeted toward Harvard’s black community, particularly those who identify as black women.
“Rico embodies a lot of values that we vibe with,” Gill said, describing how Rico Nasty not only discusses significant topics from mental health to gender identity, but can also keep a crowd on their feet during a performance.
“When we were planning this event, we didn’t just want it to be the concert. Social spaces are important for us but there’s been a lot of discussion across this campus also about making sure that the socials spaces that are provided aren’t solely just parties,” Gill said. “In addition to the concert we made sure that we had a discussion. We wanted students to interact and see this artist as a person.”
Gill added that all profits from the event will go directly to ABHW’s mentorship program for high school students in the Boston area.

Brian Appel is the co-founder of Boston Calling, an annual music festival hosted at the Harvard Athletic Complex in Allston. With this year’s festival approaching in May, Appel sat down with The Harvard Crimson to talk about what makes Boston Calling distinctive and what audiences can expect from this year’s performers.
The Harvard Crimson: What were you hoping Boston Calling would be when you helped to start it in 2013?
Brian Appel: We wanted to produce an event that was world-class caliber with the best production possible for the stages — light, sound, and everything else — so that we would attract the best artists in the world, and run it so that attendees had a fantastic experience.
THC: What ties all of the acts that you have together?
BA: Over the last 10 festivals, we’ve booked really diverse line ups, so you’ve got a lot of hip hop, a lot of indie rock, DJs, rock and roll bands, comedians, even podcasts. If I had to say there’s one common thread, it’s artists that tend to be incredible live performers. We try to book acts that, obviously, have a built-in fan base of people that love them and want to see them but also that, for attendees that come to the festival and may not have heard of them, will also put on a great show and maybe win over a bunch of new fans.
THC: How do the three headliners this year fit in to that description?
BA: Our thinking for this year is that we’re really focused on booking headliner acts that put on big, exciting, eye-catching shows. We’ve had two of the three acts before. We had Tame Impala back in 2015, and their careers were ascendant at that time. They haven’t been back to Boston since that show, so when we had the opportunity to bring them back to headline this year, we thought that that was a great fit for what we were trying to do. We also had Twenty One Pilots in 2014, and they were a middle-of-the-afternoon band for us. I remember watching them and thinking, " Man these guys are electrified on stage, and their fan base is so ravenous." They’re in the stratosphere in terms of how big they got in the past few years, so we were thrilled to bring them back. And Travis Scott, whom we’ve never had the privilege of bringing before, had such a huge year with his arena tour and his Super Bowl performance. All of the excitement around him and his live show is one of the best in the world. So we think that is the thread of all three headliners — just incredibly captivating live shows.
THC: How has the festival changed over the time that you’ve been involved?
BA: I would say the biggest change occurred in 2017 when we moved off of our original home on City Hall Plaza, which was a two-stage primarily focused on music, over to Harvard’s Athletic Complex where we gained three times the amount of square footage. We were able to add an additional outdoor stage, as well as an indoor arena where we could do alternative programming like podcasts and comedy.
THC: What are the challenges of running an event like this?
BA: It’s a big event, and most people that come only interact with the public-facing side of it. But really, there are so many moving parts to this, like the production and building of what is essentially a city. We have our own power grid that we have to build and we have to work with city departments for health and safety. We’ve got an amazing team that pulls it all together, but there are many moving parts for an event of this scale that the public never gets see to make sure that when they walk through the door everything is running perfectly.
THC: With acts as diverse as rap, comedy, and even a performance from the Boston ballet, who would you say Boston Calling is for?
BA: The people that we find that have the best experience at Boston Calling are the ones who look at the lineup poster and say, “Awesome, I’m a big fan of anywhere between three and six of these bands, and I’m gonna go, and I’m gonna get there early, and I’m gonna see all the stuff that’s out there.” Because one of the things that’s happened over the years is that a lot of the bands that we’ve had early in the day have gone on to be superstars. We had Halsey in 2015, and she was the first act that performed on one of the days and now she’s a headliner and internationally renowned.
THC: What are you most excited for in this year’s festival?
BA: I think the Boston Ballet is going to be a really great addition to the festival. I think lots of people that are coming have never had an opportunity to see the ballet, so this will be a great chance for them to get exposure to another type of the performing arts. And, like I said earlier, I think all of our headliners are incredible performers, so I’m currently looking forward to all three of those shows.

The biggest caveat of pulsating house music is that it doesn’t possess much substance when you listen to it outside the carefree, euphoria-filled dance floor. “Turn Up Charlie,” which follows the life of a DJ, is similar in this respect in that it lacks a strong or rich universal meaning. This new Netflix miniseries is full of lackluster dialogue, over-pronounced characters, and repetitive development. Although these dull aspects are sandwiched between a few redeeming moments of clarity, “Turn Up Charlie” is still an uncaptivating, average show that takes a promising premise and replaces it with shallowness and predictability.
Set in London, “Turn Up Charlie” chronicles the life of Charlie Ayo, a DJ who has fallen victim to “I-used-to-be-relevant”-itis and is seeking to find success again in the midst of one of life’s rougher patches. Portrayed by the ever-talented Idris Elba, Charlie runs into an old friend, David (JJ Feild), at a wedding. He’s now a rich and famous actor married to the successful DJ Sara Caine (Piper Perabo) — a fact that further underscores Charlie’s luckless state. When David and Sara choose to move to London, they offer Charlie a career opportunity not as lucrative as he desires: being a nanny for their self-proclaimed “precocious” daughter Gabs.
Gabs (Frankie Hervey) initially seems to be one of the least generic characters but is revealed to fulfill the stereotype of the spoiled, acerbic, and well-spoken problem child of neglectful parents. Her lines, although witty, are almost too contrived, which makes the attempt at breaking free from the rebellious, latchkey child trope fall flat. Oftentimes her attention-seeking schemes are just things that most 11-year olds would not realistically have the means or reasons to do. It seems disingenuous to fabricate such a persona, and Gabs’s edginess comes off as shallow instead of badass (recalling the foul-mouthed sensation Lil Tay and the allegations that her teen brother crafted the entirety of her “youngest flexer of the century” persona).
As her “manny,” Charlie treats Gabs with the attention she needs, which she doesn’t receive from her parents — Sara often only responds to Gabs when she addresses her mother by her first name, and David cannot figure out how to give his daughter gifts that she genuinely enjoys. The highlight of the show occurs when Charlie and Gabs become less wary of each other, each shedding their preconceived notions of one another. She understands that Charlie is more than just a washed up DJ, and Charlie sees Gabs as more than just a spoiled, foul-mouthed, and self-righteous kid. Elba shines in this tenderhearted portrayal of a “manny.” He captures the role of the parental stand-in without saccharine and with a sense of genuine compassion for Gabs. This is one of the redeeming aspects of the show: the power of a parental figure who understands that presence takes precedence over presents.
The relationship between Charlie and Gabs, while an endearing high point of the show, is nevertheless drowned out by everything else going on with the other characters. The show is named “Turn Up Charlie,” yet it seems to be less centered on Charlie and more on his rich and successful friends who continuously struggle to balance the dual difficulties of maintaining their careers and raising their child, with Charlie only as background noise to this central conflict. Furthermore, by the time the season begins to focus more on the titular Charlie and his career, the repetitive storyline of parental neglect in favor of careerism has left so little screen time to build up Charlie’s come-up that it’s hard to feel much empathy for any of the characters.
Although the show frequently includes pop culture references, “Turn Up Charlie” fails to be current when it actually matters. The way David reacted to Gabs’s first period was another unnecessary iteration of the “periods are gross and weird” narrative. We’re led to believe that Gabs’s parents are progressive, level-headed, and quite deliberate in how they raise their daughter, but her father’s reaction to menstruation is a disappointing display of how some outdated tropes are still being used even when characters are dropping EDM tracks and FaceTiming. In 2019, the trope that leads girls to believe that their periods are an unnatural feature of their bodies does not need to be recapitulated, even jokingly.
The show is filled with house beats throughout, but they’re mind-numbingly generic and oftentimes make the show seem more monotonous than necessary. Of course, it’s an apt soundtrack given the DJ-ing themes of the show, but it certainly does not bring out anything new out of the performances or the plot.
At the end of the day, “Turn Up Charlie” is a less-than-captivating show that slowly drags the viewer with it, instead of quickly reeling in the viewer. Fans of Elba may enjoy it for the sake of Elba himself, but those without any preexisting affinities for the actor will likely not find that they stumbled across an inexhaustible Netflix gem. The last episode reveals a somewhat expected twist that involves a fallout between Charlie, David, and Sara — an unnecessary addition. But Charlie and Gabs’s burgeoning relationship, the highlight of the plot, does tie up quite nicely. Even in the dull, booming bass of the dance floor, Charlie and Gabs are still able to create some meaning between themselves, which is a small triumph for an otherwise disengaging show.

An origami crane is a carrier of ill-fated hope.

Last week I stapled my hand. It was an accident. I didn’t puncture skin — no, I only know how to bleed internally. Internal lacerations only. Silent wounds only. Closed mouths only. Under-the-skin bruising only. Don’t hit where it shows. Nothing gaping. This rule enforced by police.
When it heals, the blood is still trapped under skin. Buried. It looks like a purple tattoo of a semicolon from a certain angle or an exclamation point from another. But mostly, it just looks like a staple.
Internal bleeding will turn your stool black. I know because my doctor has a chart of poop colors on her wall. Internal bleeding will kill you, slowly.
Last week I fell off a table — don’t ask me why I was on it in the first place. Point is, I fell. My leg caught on the sides, edges, corners of the table. It didn’t hurt until days after. It didn’t show until days after. There are three great masses of yellow and purple dulling the side of my left leg. They look like clouds. Or galaxies. There are galaxies buried in my left leg. Some wounds take longer to surface. Some wounds never surface and yet, internally, there has been a great puncture of sorts, a bleeding that will not be staunched, buried iconoclasm. It will destroy history, it will be history. It will create black holes in your body.
Nirvana, or blow out. Blowing out. Supreme, complete, utter annihilation. The extinguishing of. The blowing out of. The passing out from.
The final integration. From an illusion of an individual self into cosmic flux. To become, to embrace, to be cosmic flux.
“No permanent entity transmigrates from body to body, and all things, including the individual, are in a state of constant flux. But each act, word, or thought leaves its traces on the collection of the…constituents that make up the phenomenal individual…this process goes on throughout life.”(1)
The blowing out.
I feel like a candle, maybe.
Or a black hole, maybe.

With only a handful of singles and one EP out to date, Foreign Air is the best band you’ve never heard of. After going on tour with artists like Bishop Briggs and BØRNS and having songs featured in several television shows (including the popular series “You”) Foreign Air is on their first headlining tour. On April 7, just as Harvard’s annual spring concert ended a T stop away, this indie band attracted roughly 200 people to their sold-out show at the Middle East Restaurant and Nightclub in Cambridge.
Honors, an indie-pop group accompanying Foreign Air on tour, played the opening set. The Toronto-based band smoothly navigated a set only blemished by technical difficulties with humor. With their sound system up and running again, Honors performed a myriad of upbeat songs to which a small group of audience members standing at the foot of the stage knew every word.
After Honors concluded their lively performance, Foreign Air took the stage and charmed the audience. The band’s set began with an unreleased song called “Paranoid.” Despite the apparent lack of recognition, Foreign Air got the crowd moving along to the beat and transitioned effortlessly into their second song of the night, their better-known single “Lying.” Unlike many other performers, the members of Foreign Air did not speak between the first few songs. Rather, the band let their music speak for itself.
While the band did not perform their song “Echo,” to the detriment of one very verbal fan, their set included the perfect mix of their older songs and newest singles. They visibly enjoyed performing their 2018 track and crowd favorite, “Used to You,” which begins with Mason Ramsey’s (also known as the “Walmart Yodeling Kid”) famous rendition of Hank Williams’s “Lovesick Blues.” The band showcased their versatility on their newer single “Everything is Good Now,” setting aside their electronic, synthesizer heavy style for the acoustic number.
Even though the concert venue was intimate, the overall quality of Foreign Air’s show rivaled that of artists like Twenty One Pilots or Imagine Dragons who sell out large arenas. The band displayed immense performing talent, as they sounded just like their records. The members switched instruments and transition from one song to the next seamlessly. Their sound mixing was perfect as each chord, drum beat, bass line, and vocal riff could be heard clearly without overwhelming the small space. Multi-colored lights flashed behind the band but, when it came to punctuating their set, they turned to corny jokes rather than theatrics.
After the lights dimmed and the applause ceased, Foreign Air stuck around to meet with fans. The band’s do-it-yourself work ethic — as they have no record label, publishers, or designers — was rewarded by the devotion of the crowd. At the end of the night, after an apt joke about the part of the show where they leave the stage and pretend that the show is over, Foreign Air ended their set with crowd favorite and their debut single, “Free Animal,” leaving their two hundred devotees buzzing with energy and the memory of an unforgettable night.

Smoke rose amid blue lights in the Paradise Rock Club on April 9, flooding the backlit stage with a surreal, oceanic vibe. As the lights darkened, accompanied by the house band’s classical soundtrack, DJ Tukutz of Epik High sauntered onstage. Tukutz cued a slow piano instrumental which crescendoed into a smooth, jazzy beat, and in a heavenly descent amidst streams of white light, rappers Tablo and Mithra Jin joined suit, completing the trio. With all three members shining onstage, Epik High began the night with a sentimental performance of “In Seoul.” As the first song drew to a close, orange and red lights filled the club, signaling the rise of a percussive, up-tempo frenzy, as Tablo and Mithra Jin used their plastic water bottles to splash their fans.
Epik High filled the Paradise Rock Club with mellow and spunky energy, exhibiting a truly “epik” team chemistry. As part of their 2019 North American tour, the trio’s performance featured hit songs from their 2nd EP, “Sleepless in __________,” released in March. The eclectic performance also included several fan-favorite hits including “High Technology,” “Love Love Love,” and “Kill This Love.” Combined with his smooth yet incisive style of rapping, Tablo’s intricate lyrical content and trendy flow superbly complemented Mithra Jin’s deep, huskier undertones, while Tukutz spun around and DJ-ed with ease. Epic High’s charming stage mannerisms and comedic interactions with the audience, coupled with strong doses of fan service, added to the variety of the performance.
Humming out his creative process, Tablo performed an acapella version of “Lovedrunk.” An ensuing full instrumental version, underscored by melancholic piano and strings, coalesced the complicated themes of heartbreak, insomnia, and the alluring comfort of alcohol. Tablo’s smooth falsetto bridge, followed by Jin’s hard, low-toned rap, bestowed atmospheric resonance on the room.
Nostalgia adorned the rest of the performance. In the heart-wrenching song “Eternal Sunshine,” Tablo softly spoke, “Do you get lonely? Sick with anxiety? Can't trust nobody? Well, same here.” Encircled by purple and navy lights, Epik High produced a thick R&B soundscape, which sunk the room in a kind of purifying profundity. For the next song, Tablo encouraged all the audience members to take out their cell-phone flashlights and turn the whole room into a constellation of stars. As the mass of sparkling lights drifted in the sea of darkness, swaying from side to side, Epik High performed their somber single “Home Is Far Away.” Though the song told a story of unfillable dreams, Epik High offered comfort and understanding. “You’re not alone. It’s going to be okay,” Tablo said to the crowd.
Epik High interspersed the heat and intensity of their performances with with sparks of comedic relief. Tablo’s playful banter provided a circus-like element to the show. Tablo poked fun at Tukutz’s white Harvard sweatshirt, quipping that he should take over as a professor of DJ-ing. “He bought that for 60 dollars today. I don’t get it,” Tablo said. To Mithra Jin’s heartfelt comments in Korean about how he much he loved this first visit to Boston, Tablo offered goofy English translations and handed him a plush lobster keychain. Addressing the densely packed crowd, Tablo said with a smile, “It’s a Seoul-ed out show tonight!” The trio then attempted a very disorienting K-pop dance, their unbridled enthusiasm and gleeful personas piercing through the choreographic challenges.
The dynamic concert proved to embody Epik High’s paraconsistent philosophy of “sad fun” hip-hop, showcasing a strange melange of highs and the lows. They touched on sleepless nights driven by the pursuit of dreams and the fluttery excitement of newfound love, but also its nightmarish gravitas. Circling around all dimensions of the mellow and spunky, this evening with Epik High inspired tears, laughter, and healing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are few things in the world Andrea hates more than making a cappuccino with almond milk. It is, inherently, a contradictory drink. The cappuccino part necessitates foam and yet, the inclusion of almond milk makes it near impossible to produce enough to do justice to the drink’s definition. She has tried to tell customers just that, tried to ask if they’d like a latte instead, but has gotten hit with the same response so many times — “ohmygod, don’t worry, just try your best with it” — that by now, she saves her breath and time and goes about preparing the order.
It is now 12:02 p.m. on an unusually balmy Friday in February and Andrea has received a grand total of six requests for an almond milk cappuccino. All five have been delivered piping hot, with a lackluster layer of wilting foam, into students’ hands, and all five have been received with that wan, not-quite-smile white Americans in the Northeast hand out freely so as to avoid confrontation but still make their disappointment achingly clear.
Andrea’s head pulses and she wonders whether it’s from the three cups of cold brew she’s ingested today or from the almond milk cappuccinos or maybe the fact that nothing makes her feel quite so backwards as serving that heir to a real estate fortune from her game theory lecture. Or, this fourth-in-line-to-the-aristocracy blonde who always sits in front of her in English as she sports a dirty apron crusted over with coffee grounds that look a bit too much like fecal matter.
She braces herself on the counter and moves some hair out of her face.
“Hey, Carlos. Can you get this next customer? Just need a breather.”
Carlos, a tall sophomore with a solar smile and floppy hair, smiles over at Andrea and nods.
“You got it, Andre.”
Andrea attempts a smile back, worries it looks like a grimace, and lets it fall as soon as Carlos turns his back to help the next customer. She stretches her neck to one side and watches the student put his order in, eyes glazing disinterestedly over the green quarter-zip and sandy blond hair. He’s probably ordering an almond milk cappuccino.
Andrea turns away from him and Carlos and picks up a rag to start wiping down the counters. She lets herself get lost in the repetition of the cloth over the cheap fake-granite, tunes out the indie punk playing over the speakers, and lets the waves of whooshing milk frothers trickle into idle chat about the importance of some midterm for some professor who attended lecture sporadically. Here and there, Andrea would pick up some particularly impassioned phrase and decide whether to allow an energy spike substantial enough to follow the conversation.
“…and then he told me that he was seeing this other girl and THEN, I found out that it was Amanda, that…”
Not worth it.
“…my TA is a fucking asshole, can you believe…”
Boring. No further reminder of class needed anyways.
“…yeah dude, the shit that’s been going on there is wild. Like, we haven’t seen anything this crazy in Latin America since like…Cuba.”
Wait. Stop, stop, turn back. Andrea’s back tenses and she moves the rag to the espresso machine now. Listens. Another voice this time, dripping with the kind of confident disdain possessed only by boys who summered in the Hamptons, rebelliously touting worn copies of Marx’s manifesto underneath their tycoon father’s straight noses.
“Yeah, I don’t get it. It’s obviously some imperialist bullshit the US is on, saying they’re recognizing this Guaido guy as the official leader. I mean, come on, there was an election, Maduro was voted in, end of story.”
The two voices blend together into a blur of unintelligibly unintelligent white noise, rising in pitch and frequency until a dog whistle is ringing in Andrea’s ears and palpitations are churning in her chest. She feels herself drop the rag and walk in front of the counter, hears her voice telling Carlos she will be right back. The whistle triggers a roving siren of noise through her head and down her body so that every movement undulates with the ringing echoes of the overheard conversation. By the time her body feels like one unified moving thing, instead of minute points of individual ripples, she looks up and sees herself. Andrea blinks and so does her copy.
The physical surroundings of chipped toilet bowls and the faint smell of bleach from this morning’s bathroom cleaning trigger a shift from the queasy waves of the last two minutes to sharp crests and troughs that infect her thoughts and lungs, producing a sort of enraged rhythmic heavy breath.
In an attempt to calm herself, Andrea takes out her phone from the pocket of her jean jacket. One missed call, one message, and one text. Same source. A heavy breath breaks her out. Mom.
“Hi, nena. Don’t worry, just wanted to see if you could talk. I’m sure you’re busy.”
Another breath, this time verging on a rattle.
“Call me later if you can? Te quiero. Dios te bendiga.”
Andrea’s fingers hover next to the call button and then quickly move to messages. Her mother’s sits at the top.
“Hola, nena. Dios te bendiga. I hope you’re well…know you’re busy but…wanted to talk if you have any time today. Things in Venezuela are really getting to me…couldn’t get out of bed today, just stayed in watching the news. Thank God the US recognized Guaido…maybe more countries will follow now. Anyway…love you. Call me.”
Andrea stares at the little gray bubble, wills it to stay still and stop swimming before her eyes, tricking her in an endless deciphering game. She reads the words over, eyes passing over “out of bed” a few times in an attempt to make the letters unrecognizable.
It doesn’t work.

To the Editor:
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is dedicated to promoting a diverse and inclusive community for all members of our student body. Recent Crimson reporting and an editorial by The Crimson Editorial Board have criticized the diversity efforts of GSAS without a clear representation of the many programs, activities, and people that have advanced — and continue to advance — these efforts. These reports have inferred that named members of the GSAS staff are culpable in holding diversity back at the school. What I have found most troubling is the way in which reporting has drawn attention to and magnified personal attacks on GSAS staff, leaving no room for respectful dialogue and constructive conversation.
Less than 10 years ago, underrepresented student enrollment in GSAS stood at 4 percent. Since then, thanks to recruitment efforts led by the GSAS Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs working with our faculty, that number has tripled. ODMA runs a number of pipeline programs that give undergraduates the research experience necessary to pursue graduate study at Harvard and elsewhere. They work with student groups to provide advice and other support. Their activities — too numerous to mention here — during and after business hours and on weekends, are a labor of love and a testament to their exceptional commitment to our students.
Inclusion and belonging are a priority for me as dean, as it was for my predecessors. I’ve seen firsthand the efforts of the Dudley House leadership, staff, and fellows to make Dudley a welcoming home for all students. In October, it was announced that Dudley House will transition to form the Dudley Community for undergraduates and the GSAS Student Center for graduate students. As The Crimson has reported, GSAS launched a yearlong information gathering process, which will inform our search for the inaugural center director and provide direction for the shape of the student center to come. We have surveyed students, met with student groups to hear their perspectives, and asked students to serve on the executive director selection committee. As has been mentioned, GSAS received a proposal on diversity from concerned students. It has been closely read, has been and will continue to be discussed with student leaders, and will be considered, along with other suggestions, as we continue the review process over the next academic year. I want to stress that we are currently in the information gathering phase and have not yet determined what shape the GSAS Student Center will take. No changes will be made without a thoughtful, inclusive process that ensures all students have the opportunity to participate.
Can GSAS do better? Of course we can, and we must: GSAS, like the rest of the University, has taken to heart the sobering message from the final report of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging and is committed to furthering change that will ensure that all the remarkable students who have chosen to come to Harvard feel welcome here and have what they need to reach their full potential. That is why we are dedicated to soliciting and gathering feedback from students. That is why we develop new programming and initiatives, such as the creation of the diversity and inclusion fellows. That is the work of GSAS. We look forward to continuing to engage in respectful, rational discussion that advances the needs of everyone in our community.

It is now Holy Week; this Sunday is Easter; Lent is nearly over. This is far and away the best time of the year, liturgically speaking. A rather startling number of events are commemorated in quick succession: the institution of the Eucharist and of Holy Orders, the Mandatum, and the Lord’s Passion, Death, and Resurrection.
In the midst of all this comes the Easter Vigil on the night of Holy Saturday, which contains no historical event of its own but has the honor of hosting the first celebration of the Resurrection. And in the middle of this vigil, all those who have been preparing to enter the church are finally received with whatever sacraments they lack.
Unlike those baptized as infants, who have the benefit of being in the church their whole lives, these converts have had to come to the faith on their own, exploring, reading, praying, asking, discussing. This is often a process of years, which is caution one would expect when dealing with matters of eternity. But somehow or other, they become convinced that the church is the pillar and the ground of truth, and they can do no other.
That this phenomenon occurs at all is cause for celebration; that it occurs at Harvard is, in a certain way, shocking. The conservative grapevine is always ripe with stories of the left-wing excesses of universities, and many a freshman’s religious upbringing has been brought down before his first round of midterms. The stock character of a naïve Christian teenager become atheist in college exists for a reason.
Who, then, go in the opposite direction, and what disposes them to do so? Many Harvard students now, it seems, did not arrive at irreligion by conscious rejection of religion. Instead religion has never been part of their lives, so they see no reason to encourage it to be part of their thoughts. I myself find this difficult to imagine, but as it happens people can live fairly productive lives without ever answering the question of their meaning. The nihilism that novelists and philosophers argue follows from atheism follows only in strict logical terms, and few atheists are capable of that mental asceticism.
Everyone else, however, displays an incredible ability to democratize that most undemocratizable of attainments, the Nietzschean Übermensch. They can supply enough things to do and think about that the alleged meaninglessness of their lives never occurs to them. Even if it did, it would seem plainly contradicted by the list of public services and charitable works that they had accomplished that day alone. Club elections, business deals, dating problems, and any number of other concerns are able so to dominate the mind that questions of eternity never have a chance to intrude, and if ever they do, they look ridiculous.
In fact, living as a Nietzschean Übermensch — or, at least, the unwitting version of one, if the reader will concede me this adaptation — is the default option of mankind, religious and not. The religious have to strain every day to remember that they are in the presence of God and that death and judgment await them. In most cases it is easier to focus on the details of one’s immediate temporal surroundings.
How does one dislodge the non-religious from this ostensibly urgent system of values and get them to consider the eternal verities? Here we meet obstacles other than mere force of indifferent habit. There are various scientific objections to the existence of God. There are the gross nitwitteries perpetrated in the New York Times. There are hypocrisy, lies, tepidity, sexual abuse, arrogance, and uncharity.
But there are also these converts to the church, who have managed to overcome all these obstacles and then some. They have walked through the valley of the shadow of Richard Dawkins and have not been harmed. Pope Benedict XVI has said that the saints are the best argument for the faith; likewise these converts are powerful arguments for conversion. They demonstrate the possibility of something so outlandish as becoming Catholic while at Harvard. They are a perfect sign of contradiction, not merely holding fast against the current, as the cradle Catholics do, but sailing full-bore in the opposite direction.
The zeal of the convert is indeed legendary, an inspiration to the lifelong faithful. Perhaps, more importantly, however, it is a shock to the unconverted, and shock is the first ingredient in evangelism. Not an off-putting shock, of course — just enough of a disturbance to jolt the average Johnny Harvard out of his routine of meaningful inanities and into reflection about supernatural truths.
This, from a list nigh uncountable, is one of the joys of Easter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly a year after the departure of the College’s former assistant dean for public service, Gene A. Corbin, Harvard has launched a search for a new public service dean. In the months following Corbin’s decision to step down from his position, administrators announced an internal review of the College’s public service initiatives, seeking to improve coordination between many University offices and resources. With the administration's review complete, the College will begin reviewing candidates for the newly-established “Assistant Dean for Civic Engagement and Service” in May.
Regardless of whom Harvard ultimately appoints as the new dean, Corbin has left big shoes to fill. He has worked to ensure public service remains a priority for the student body at large during his 15 year tenure in public service at Harvard — through both his role as executive director of the Phillips Brooks House Association, and during his time as public service dean. We are heartened to see that administrators have taken the time to rigorously assess the College’s public service initiatives following Corbin’s departure, and consider the ways in which the role has changed over time.
In its search for a new dean of public service, we hope the committee tasked with filling the position prioritizes the selection of an individual capable of reinvigorating the public service internship process on campus for students. In pursuit of this goal, we believe the new dean of public service should prioritize assessing the efficacy of current funding for public service internships, and work to increase the number of such internships available for students at the College. Furthermore, the new public service dean should look to strengthen the College’s current ties with PBHA and the Office of Career Services, and work to forge stronger connections among alumni with experience in the public service sector.
Finally, we believe the new public service dean must prioritize highlighting public service as a viable and meaningful career path students may take after graduation. The search to fill this position comes at a time when few Harvard undergraduates choose to pursue careers in public service after graduation. Only 3.5 percent of The Crimson’s Class of 2018 senior survey respondents indicated they planned to pursue post-graduate work in either public service or nonprofit work — a statistic down nearly half from the previous year. On a campus as politically active as Harvard, we feel there is much room for improvement in this regard. The new dean will have the opportunity to implement institutional reforms that direct students to internships across public service occupations, hopefully inspiring hundreds or thousands of students over the years to careers with meaningful impact on the lives of others. That chance must not go to waste.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students, alumni, and staff battled wind and intermittent rain to complete the 123rd running of the Boston Marathon on Monday.
The 26.2 mile course begins in Hopkinton and concludes in Copley Square after weaving through suburbs west of Boston, with notable features such as Heartbreak Hill in Newton. The marathon was the culmination of months of grueling training for all and, for some, fundraising as well. Race day would turn out to be no easier.
Bjarni Atlason ’22, who was running in his first marathon, contracted a 105 degree fever just five days before race day. He was bedridden until Saturday but still came out for the race. The race was a two sided tale for Atalson, who vomited midway through the race and received medical treatment.
“The first half I did okay,” Atalson said. “But I thought by the middle ‘this was not good.’ I started throwing up a lot and was taken into a medical tent, but snuck out and walked the second half.”
First held in 1897, the Boston Marathon is the world’s oldest annual marathon. Participants typically enter one of two ways: running a qualifying time at a previous marathon or running on behalf of a recognized charity.
Five racers from Harvard ran with the Harvard College Marathon Challenge — an email list that brings together Harvard runners and helps them raise money for charities. The team raised money for the Phillips Brook House Association, a College-affiliated nonprofit which offers public service opportunities for students.
Harvard University Police Department Detective Robert Surette, who ran with HCMC, said that during the race he was grateful for the support from PBHA and other friends.
“They were great, just the support from the whole community,” Surette said after the race. “It's great to have this opportunity. Just a once in a lifetime thing.”
Sisters Audrey K. Warner ’19 and Elizabeth S. Warner ’17 ran for an organization called Stepping Strong, which was founded in response to the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. The two said they were happy to be able to run the marathon side by side. Audrey said she talked with her sister “as much as we could — except for on the hills.”
A group of the Warners’ friends came out to support them and were there to provide greetings and hugs as the rain picked up after the sisters finished the race.
“It's just such a cool day and for us to know people that are actually running,” Isabel Jasper ’19, one of the Warners' friends, said.
“It's a really cool community that comes out for it,” another friend, Michael J. Kassabian ’19, added.
Gabriela J. Siegal ’20 and her self-described “marathon buddy” Aurelia S. Han ’22 also journeyed across the Charles River to run the race together.
“It was awesome — Aurelia and I ran together, and I couldn’t have done it without her. She kept me going when it got hard! She’s forever my marathon buddy,” Siegal wrote in an email after the race.
For some Harvard runners, this is the first marathon of many planned runs. Atalson, for one, said “the next one will be better.”
For others, the focus is more near-sighted. Surette said he had a simple plan for the rest of the day.
“Relax, eat pizza. Take a nap. That’s about what's on my mind,” Surette said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services rejected two College students’ proposal to make naloxone — a nasal spray used to counter the effects of an opioid overdose — publicly accessible on the University’s campus.
After taking a graduate-level course on the opioid crisis in the History of Science department, Kailash Sundaram ’19 and Eana X. Meng ’19 proposed in December that HUHS make naloxone available to Harvard affiliates and members of the greater-Cambridge area.
Sundaram and Meng’s proposal had called for naloxone to be placed in every Automated External Defibrillator box across campus and in all Harvard University Police Department cruisers, for a total of approximately 400 units accessible to the public. They projected the total initial cost to be approximately $18,500, with an additional maintenance cost of $14,000 every two years afterward.
Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria Francesconi, who served as the HUHS liaison on the students’ proposal, informed Sundaram and Meng of the University’s final decision in an hour-long discussion, according to Sundaram. Francesconi reached her decision after consulting a group of professionals including HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira, HUHS Chief Medical Officer Soheyla Gharib, Adams House Faculty Dean John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’69, a lawyer, and a Harvard University Police Department officer, Sundaram wrote in an email.
According to Sundaram and Meng, HUHS offered three reasons for deciding against the proposal: HUPD officers already carry naloxone, it is difficult to maintain up-to-date medication in AED boxes, and there is contradictory research surrounding the benefits of naloxone.
“They had some skepticism about whether the research actually suggested that naloxone would be effective at Harvard,” Sundaram said.
Sundaram and Meng, however, said in an interview that several studies confirm the lifesaving potential of the drug.
“On the contrary, though, there is a lot of research suggesting naloxone is quite effective,” Sundaram said. “Actually, a Stanford study by two Stanford professors has shown naloxone will save 21,000 lives over the next decade.”
Meng and Sundaram also said they were frustrated by HUHS administrators' emphasis on HUPD as an adequate public source of naloxone.
“We're not so sure if that's an effective reason because, one, opioid users are often scared to contact the police because of fear of criminal repercussions,” Sundaram said.
Sundaram and Meng also added that police response times can be too long in the critical moments of an overdose.
“It's just an average [response] time of two to four minutes. And so sometimes they will take longer, and a person can die of an overdose pretty quickly,” Meng said. “The faster the person gets the naloxone, they just have a much, much higher chance of recovery.”
When asked about the factors that went into HUHS's decision, HUHS Spokesperson Michael Perry wrote in an emailed statement that despite their recent decision, HUHS isn’t entirely opposed to the idea of naloxone being publicly accessible on campus.
“HUHS is committed to ongoing conversations across the Harvard community to determine best ways to address emergent situations such as overdose and better understand opioid use on our campus through our health assessment survey that we will distribute next academic year,” Perry wrote. “HUHS will continue to consider the possibility of Narcan in our AED boxes when we have more data.”
Narcan is the brand name for naloxone.
Despite HUHS's stance, Sundaram and Meng said they plan to keep advocating for opioid awareness on campus and the need for naloxone to reach the greater-Cambridge area.
“We're in the works forming an organization and a working committee to continue this effort to make naloxone available at Harvard,” Sundaram said. “Just because HUHS said it's not the right time, doesn't mean that it's not the right time.”
In an emailed statement, Sundaram and Meng said their working group’s name will be Harvard for Opioid Overdose Prevention and Education — HOOPE for short.
Meng and Sundaram have also created a petition for other students to show their support for the project and advocate for HUHS to implement it.
The pair stressed that the importance of the initiative lies not just in expanding access to naloxone but also in educating the public.
“What we were hoping to do with this project is not only about the naloxone in and of itself, but it's about the broader thing about raising awareness and definitely about de-stigmatizing the opioid crisis,” Meng said.
“I think it's Harvard chance to be a leader and to raise awareness. So we're going to continue this effort,” Sundaram added.

George Putnam Jr. ’49, Harvard University’s 27th Treasurer and a former member of the Board of Overseers, died on March 25 at the age of 92.
The great nephew of former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Putnam created the Harvard Management Company — the firm that oversees the University’s multi-billion dollar endowment — and served as its first leader, which greatly influenced how universities manage their endowments. Putnam served as Treasurer for 11 years, beginning in 1973 and stepping down in 1984.
Putnam holds three degrees from Harvard, earning his bachelor’s degree in biology from the College in 1949, an MBA from the Business School in 1951, and an honorary degree in 1985.
He also served as chairman of Putnam Investments, a Boston investment firm founded in 1937 by his namesake father. Putnam retired in 2001 after 50 years at the business, having managed each of the company’s mutual funds.
Putnam served on a variety of boards including that of Wellesley College, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Museum of Fine Arts.
His son, George Putnam III ’73, said his father's dedication to Harvard extended far beyond his years as a student at the College and Business School.
“He felt very strongly about giving something back to the community generally but also to the institution that had been helpful to him,” Putnam III said. “So when the opportunity came up first to be an Overseer and then to be the Treasurer, he really leapt at them.”
Putnam Jr. served on the search committee for the job he eventually landed — University Treasurer. Compared to his predecessors, Putnam was the first treasurer to devote most of his time to the job — previous treasurers held full-time jobs as financiers in addition to their role as University Treasurer.
Prior to taking over the helm of Harvard’s finances, Putnam served as a member of the Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing body. In a 1974 report he wrote for the 25th anniversary of his College graduation, Putnam called those experiences “incomparable opportunities to learn about the University.”
“It has been a short but stimulating twenty-five years — and it has been a lot of fun,” Putnam wrote.
Putnam III recalled memories of his father’s time outside of his work — time which he used to pursue “a number of hobbies.”
“He loved building model trains,” Putnam III said. “He loved growing orchids. He loved working with his hands, wood-working and working outside.”
“Everything he did, he did with a huge amount of energy,” Putnam III added.
Putnam Jr. is survived by his son, his wife Nancy B.B. Putnam, his two daughters — Bambi Putnam and Susan W. Peck, his 10 grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.
In his 1974 anniversary report, Putnam said he was “grateful” for experiences both in his personal and professional life.
“As I look back I am very grateful for the opportunity to work in a field which provided a valuable service to people and institutions large and small and the opportunity to serve and learn from a variety of fine institutions of learning and healing,” Putnam wrote.
“I am particularly grateful for a wonderful wife who continues to make it all possible — and fun — and for three fine children who have given us both great pleasure,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern criticized President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and said the city would welcome asylum seekers detained at the border, during an appearance on Fox News Sunday.
His comments follow various public statements from Trump that have proposed to release migrant detainees from the United States-Mexico border into sanctuary cities, areas where law enforcement do not actively pursue or detain undocumented immigrants living in the community. Though it was reported last week that the administration never seriously considered the proposal, Trump reaffirmed the idea in a series of tweets Friday.
McGovern said the president’s statements on immigration “drive wedges” during a Sunday morning segment of “Fox and Friends.”
“At the end of the day, we have to have a real conversation and understand that these folks seeking asylum are people,” McGovern said. “They are not cargo.”
McGovern fielded questions from “Fox and Friends” hosts Ed Henry and Peter “Pete” B. Hegseth related to sanctuary cities, immigrant asylum policy, and the construction of a border wall. He also addressed what he said are the “misconceptions” about sanctuary cities, citing legal procedures and federal cooperation the city follows when law enforcement find that an immigrant has committed a crime.
“We are a welcoming city and we will welcome anyone who comes to our city,” he said.
In an interview with The Crimson Monday, McGovern said he felt “obligated” to appear on Fox, adding that he wanted to “offer a take” that might not otherwise be presented.
“I'm certainly never afraid to talk to anybody about these important issues and my position,” he said. “Let's have some thoughtful, planned conversation about how we're going to help people. That's what we should be having, not inflammatory tweets that are politically motivated.”
Cambridge has held sanctuary city status since 1985. The city government also works with local nonprofits to coordinate “Know Your Rights” trainings about immigration law, provide information about available services, and assist with legal services and counseling needs for its immigrant population.
Philip L. Torrey, managing attorney of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, praised the work that local organizations do to support immigrants living in the Greater Boston area in the face of Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric.
“[The president] purposely terrorizes the immigrant community, but I think, on a positive note, a lot of the local policies here and a lot of the work done by the immigrant community themselves and other organizations have really fought back against that pretty effectively,” Torrey said. “People are mobilized, people are getting out there, they’re making sure they know their rights, they’re seeking legal counsel when they can.”
Geeta Pradhan — president and CEO of the Cambridge Community Foundation, a non-profit charity that supports local residents — called McGovern’s appearance on Fox “bold,” and said she was pleased to see him defend Cambridge's role as a sanctuary city. She said her foundation seeks to support immigrants from a “humanitarian perspective,” in order to put “partisan issues aside.”
“This isn't an issue of Republican versus Democratic,” Pradhan said. “And so my hope is that as we bring the humanity of this closer to people, they will act, they will do what they can, what is in their capacity to help.”
Pradhan also cited the United Legal Defense Fund for Immigrants established last month by the cities of Cambridge and Somerville in partnership with the CCF. The fund raises and distributes funds to cover legal costs for immigrants, and are distributed to local non-profit organizations.
In the Fox and Friends segment, McGovern said he hopes lawmakers can find common ground over how to reform the immigration system.
“I don't think anyone — Democrat, Republican, right, left — is going to say that we have an immigration system that's working right now, I think we all agree on that,” he said. “The question is, how are we going to fix it?”

Bringing an end to a decades-old Dunster House tradition, Faculty Deans Cheryl K. Chen and Sean D. Kelly canceled the main event of the House’s annual goat roast: the skinning and barbecuing of a locally sourced goat in the courtyard.
Some Dunster residents’ discomfort with the event and health concerns flagged by a environmental health inspector motivated the decision to end the tradition, Kelly wrote in an email to house residents Friday.
He also wrote that Dunster will continue to hold a “goat roast” this year, though without the traditional roasting of a goat.
“Cheryl and I have decided that the goat roast this year will not include the traditional ritual of slaughtering, transporting, and, in the main Dunster Courtyard, skinning the carcass of a goat with paleolithic tools,” the email reads.
Harvard Associate Director of Environmental Public Health Valerie Nelson said she informed the faculty deans of the health risks associated with the handling of animal carcasses earlier this year.
“If you just grabbed a goat from someone's farm that was sick and carrying an illness that's transmissible to humans, some of those might be leptospirosis, cryptosporidium, Q fever,” she said.
Dunster House Committee co-chair Shannon T. Beattie ’20 said the procedures Nelson outlined for safely handling a goat seemed too logistically difficult to put in place and continue the tradition.
“We could either do all of the tasks that she required of us in order to continue the tradition or just end it,” she said. “But I think it was made very difficult for us to continue the tradition.”
Beattie said she enjoyed the goat roast because of the conversations it sparked in the house, despite being a vegetarian and not eating any of the goat.
“I feel like the most valuable part of the tradition to me was sort of that uncomfortability that people got with the food that they were eating,” she said. “They were forced to confront the skinning of the goat and the roasting of it and everything.”
Iris R. Feldman ’20 also said she thought that the discomfort caused by seeing the meat prepared and cooked was valuable for her classmates who eat meat in the dining hall.
“I think that that discomfort in some ways was very productive because, if you are comfortable eating meat in the dhall, but you aren't comfortable with the goat roast — those are the same thing,” Feldman said.
Dunster’s annual goat roast began in the 1980s as a spinoff of a primitive survival course taught by Human and Evolutionary Biology Professor and then-resident tutor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86. Each year, after the goat is skinned in the courtyard, students and house staff marinate the carcass in lime, curry, salt, pepper, herbs and garlic. After marinating overnight, dining staff roast the goat on a spit over a bed of coals.
Lieberman said the goat roast was always an educational event during his time in Dunster House.
“It had an educational purpose, which is to teach students how our ancestors survived for millions of years,” he said.
While Dunster residents may not have the chance to feast on goat this year, Kelly wrote in an email to The Crimson that he looks forward to seeing the house “re-imagine the goat roast for the twenty-first century.”
Kelly floated the possibility of a roast “in the fashion of the White House Correspondents’ Dinner” or a “goat petting zoo” to replace the annual barbecue in his Friday email to Dunster residents.

A team of six Harvard Kennedy School students won a “hackathon-style” Social Security policy challenge hosted by former Senator Heidi K. Heitkamp (D-ND) and Gary D. Cohn, former director of the National Economic Council for the Trump Administration, at the Institute of Politics Monday evening.
As members of “Team Renaissance,” Abdul-Hakeem A. Buhari, Lucien A. Charland, Roy S. Liu, Anthony G. Pascua, Jeremy L. Strickland, and Jinghao Yan presented policy solutions to address long-term financing shortfalls that the United States Social Security Administration faces.
The competition, entitled “Road to 2092: Save Social Security,” was a capstone of “The Real State of the Union,” a weekly discussion about the state of the economy co-hosted by Heitkamp and Cohn. Team Renaissance will travel to Washington, D.C. alongside Heitkamp and Cohn to present their proposal to members of Congress and officials in the Trump administration. The six students will also appear on MSNBC to discuss their plan.
Social Security trust funds are expected to continue depleting cash reserves over the next several years. Heitkamp wrote in a press release that children born today “will rely on Social Security for retirement in 2092.”
Winners were announced after five finalist groups presented their ideas at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. The competition prompt was released Saturday at noon and teams had until Sunday at 5 p.m. to devise their solutions.
Senator Angus King (I-Maine) judged the final entries alongside Cohn and Heitkamp. Cohn told the crowd at the IOP that he and the other judges were seeking “politically feasible” and “mathematically sound” entries that took a creative approach to the problem.
“We didn’t want people to just come in and move the levers on things that we knew were the obvious levers,” Cohn said.
Institute of Politics Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said at Monday's announcement event that addressing concerns about Social Security is critical for policymakers.
“This is a nettlesome, thorny issue that’s vexed policymakers for decades,” Gearan said. “This is very real.”
Heitkamp said in an interview after the event that she and Cohn wanted to address Social Security insolvency because the issue is particularly urgent for young voters.
“One of the things that we’ve tried to do here is to explore intergenerational transfer of obligation and responsibility,” she said. “We want to make people aware that these are really important pocketbook issues for you now.”
Liu, who delivered the majority of his team’s final pitch, agreed that Social Security reform is a “really pressing problem” for young voters.
“It was really good to get young people involved, because these are the people that are going to suffer the most when funding becomes insolvent,” Liu said in an interview after the event.
In total, more than 250 students from 28 universities across the country participated in the competition. J. Miguel Undurraga ’19, who worked as a liaison for Cohn this semester and helped organize the policy challenge, said a nationwide solicitation of ideas was a key goal.
“Social Security is one of the toughest structural problems that our country is facing, and so we thought it best to solicit ideas from across the country,” he said. “This was about creating a groundswell of collaborative working here at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Ivy League 7s final in sudden death overtime, Dartmouth wing Ariana Ramsey found herself in space on the right sideline. Ramsey had been showing her speed all day, racking up eleven tries through four games. Harvard’s Arianna Romero, a sophomore wing, was all that stood between the try zone and the speedy Ramsey.
“I knew she had burned me a couple of times before,” Romero said of Ramsey’s run. “But I had it in my head that she wasn’t gonna get past me that time.”
Ramsey picked up speed, but was no match for Romero, who made the tackle, sending the Crimson bench, standing just feet away, into a frenzy. On the ensuing possession, Harvard quickly worked the ball to the other sideline, to junior wing Dominique Cantave. Eluding two defenders, she ran nearly the length of the field to secure the victory —and the Ivy League 7s title — for the Crimson.
Harvard (8-2, 3-2 Ivy League) finished the Ancient Eight tournament at 3-1, picking up a win against every team present on the way to their third Ivy League Sevens title in program history, winning the final by a score of 22-17. Their title win was preceded by a 38-0 thumping of Brown, a 29-5 victory over Princeton, and a 31-14 loss versus Dartmouth in the first round.
“We got our second Ivy League championship of the year, so that’s something that’s really special and important,” Romero said of the victory. “We have a really strong group of seniors and a really good group overall.”
The final against Dartmouth came was a grudge match for the Crimson, as it had lost its last two matches versus the Big Green, as well as last year’s Ivy 7s final. Despite taking a tough loss to Dartmouth just hours before, Harvard was able to get the job done when it mattered, defeating their conference rivals for the first time since last year’s Collegiate Rugby National Championship semifinal.
The Crimson got the day started by cruising to a 38-0 win over Brown on Mignone Field. Cantave led the team with two tries, while fellow junior, scrum-half Delia Hellander added two of her own. The win marked Harvard’s highest-scoring shutout of the season, as well as their second-largest margin of victory.
The second match of pool play saw the Crimson matched up against Princeton. Freshman fly-half Cassidy Bargell led the team with three tries, while Romero added the other two, one of which was a penalty try. The win, combined with Dartmouth’s win over Brown, ensured Harvard a spot in the final with a game versus the Big Green still to play.
The final match of pool play had no bearing on the outcome of the tournament given that both teams were through to the final, but that didn’t mean that either team was going to take it easy. Both teams came out firing on all cylinders, but Dartmouth claimed a slim 14-7 advantage at the half. The Big Green went on to score three unanswered tries in the second half before the Crimson added a try through Bargell, her fifth of the day, as time winded down. The game finished 31-14, and after Dartmouth’s dominant second half performance, they looked likely to claim their second consecutive Ivy Sevens title in the ensuing final.
“We took some time to recover, rest, refuel, and get some stretching in so our bodies could feel good.” senior fly-half Genevieve Quirion said. “We made a couple of adjustments on defense, and tried to find that fire again and not think about the last game, and just play what was in front of us.”
Following the third place match, which Princeton won 26-12 over Brown, Harvard and Dartmouth took the field for a rematch of last year’s final. The Crimson dictated the pace of the game early on as Hellander and Cantave found the try zone for Harvard, but the Big Green responded each time with tries of their own. The teams entered half time tied at 12-12.
Bargell continued to impress for the Crimson, tallying her team-best sixth try with just under five minutes to play, putting the Crimson up 17-12. Two minutes later, Dartmouth answered again, tying the game at 17-17 with two minutes remaining. Neither team was able to break through before the end of regulation, meaning the final was to be decided in sudden death overtime.
With everything on the line after a long day, Harvard made quick work of the Big Green in overtime. After just a couple of minutes of play near the center of the field, Dartmouth seemed to break away, before Romero’s last-ditch tackle on Ramsey near the sideline. Cantave’s ensuing cross-field run was her fourth try of the day, and undoubtedly her most important score.
The win marked the Crimson’s third Ivy Sevens title, its first since 2015-16. Harvard will look to add another title, the Collegiate Rugby National Championship, on May 24 and 25th in Tucson, Ariz. Despite their victory over the weekend, Quirion and the rest of the team are already looking ahead to the next challenge.
“The Ivy League Championship has always been our goal over the last four years. The fact that we were able to do it, and that I was able to do it as a senior especially, was pretty amazing,” Quirion said of the win. “Right now, the most important thing is to recover from yesterday and make sure our bodies are ready for more.”

After back to back Ivy League title losses in 2016 and 2017, Harvard softball looked to finally clinch that coveted Ivy title in their 2018 run. Starting off the season strong, the Crimson looked to make a statement that showed that they would not be denied an Ivy title again.
“We came off a series of defeats late in season, the Ivy League championship was a heartbreaking loss,” sophomore infielder Morgan Melito said. “A lot of highs and lows within those seasons and ultimately we made it to the championship series those couple of years but fell short. Coming into last year we had a definite goal to make it to the championship and pull through and win it.
However, after going 1-4 in their last five games, Harvard softball entered the postseason with a chip on their shoulder, hungry to prove their superiority over their conference rivals. As the regular season concluded, a last minute change orchestrated by conference officials completely shook up the Ivy League picture.
“A week before the championship series the athletic directors of the Ivy League got together and decided to change it last minute,” Melito said. “The winner [of the Ivy League] would be the best record.”
This change stated that the stated that the team with the best overall record would be crowned the Ivy League champion, which was Dartmouth. Thanks to this unusual turn of events, the Crimson did something that has not been done in recent memory; they entered the Ivy League tournament to compete for a crown that has already been given away.
HARVARD VS. DARTMOUTH
After a scoreless first two innings, the Crimson and the Big Green traded runs in the third and fourth innings. Coming into the fifth inning, the Crimson hoped to break away with the lead but found themselves on the defensive, ultimately giving up three runs and staring at a 4-1 deficit as the game entered the seventh and final inning.
“We were down to the seventh inning,” said Melito. “Down a few runs and we had an incredible rally back.’
In the top of the seventh inning with game one on the line, the Crimson began their comeback campaign with then junior outfielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer walking to first base. Afterwards the Crimson got into deep trouble, with their next two batters recording out, setting up a very tense do or die situation.
“A combination of hits and making [Dartmouth] make errors, we did everything we could to keep that inning going,” said Melito. “People came in clutch in a lot of different situations for a lot of different reason. The dugout had an incredible energy really backing our hitters up.”
The Crimson’s fortune quickly turned when then junior infielder Meagan Lantz connected with a high-speed pitch and launched the ball down the center for a homerun, allowing her and Schiffhauer to score and cut the Big Green’s lead to one.
“We came down to two outs and two strikes,” said Melito. “We continued to find a way to get on base and chip away and eventually we came out on top.”
After multiple 2 strikes situations, the Crimson managed to gain the lead after a single allowed then senior outfielder Dallas Hogan and then junior infielder Erin Lockhart to score. The Crimson wrapped up the rest of the inning and left game one victorious.
Coming off a game one victory, the Crimson raced out of the gates roaring in game two with 2 runs in the first inning and 2 more after the forth, all while keeping Dartmouth scoreless. It was not until the seventh inning that the Big Green found home plate but by that time it was much too late.
“It was such a celebration of joy”, said Melito. “A celebration of all our hard work, all those four years for those then seniors, and [overcoming] a number of injuries that year.”
Thanks to Harvard’s two game sweep and conference officials’ decision prior to the tournament, it was ruled that the 2018 Ivy League title would be shared by both the Crimson and the Big Green, resulting in each of them being crowned as co-champions.
While the Crimson were celebrating their victory on the softball field, others were celebrating with them at home, including the incoming freshman softball class.
“It motivated me to work hard at home and get prepared for next year,” said freshman pitcher and first baseman Brianna Jewett. “It was very exciting for the program because they have been in the championship series in recent years but have not won [until now].”
Looking to replicate last season’s success, this year’s incoming freshman class look towards the upperclassmen on that for guidance and mentorship.
“The seniors have dedicated a lot of time to the program and have been encouraging and welcoming to everyone”, Jewett said. “We all have a really tight bond and want to do it for each other.”

On April 7, hundreds of undergraduates congregated in Harvard’s Tercentenary Theatre to celebrate the spring and sun at Harvard’s annual outdoor concert, Yardfest. The crowd enjoyed performances from student groups Extra Extra and Maybe There’s Life, followed by two joint-headliners, Kiiara and Bazzi. The Crimson sent two dedicated journalists to find out how students really felt about Yardfest 2019.
Ella Q. Michaels '22
Roving Reporters: What are your general thoughts on this year’s Yardfest?
EQM: I’m sort of generally optimistic about the principle of the Harvard tradition, and maybe a little disappointed about how the administration has gone about handling it this particular year, based on what I’ve heard from years past.
RR: What are your thoughts on the headliners?
EQM: Had I heard of them? Nope! Had I heard of some of their songs? Like, peripherally.
RR: Do you have a favorite song?
EQM: It’s like the (*starts singing the melody of “Gold”*), that one? And then like the “You so fucking precious when you,” whatever, by Bazzi. Honestly, I’m here for Ethan Fields of Extra Extra, and then depending on how I feel I may or may not actually dip.
RR: What’s your biggest existential crisis right now?
EQM: You want me to pick one?
RR: Just pick a fun one.
EQM: Now this is my biggest existential crisis, picking which one of my existential crises is the biggest.
Alexa C. Jordan '22
RR: What do you think about the whole Yardfest shebang?
ACJ: I think it’s really cool that Harvard is willing to bring distinguished artists to campus, and I think it’s a pretty good time as well, because it’s after spring break, we’ve had a few weeks to come back, it’s kind of like a nice study break, I would say.
RR: So you mentioned distinguished artists, what are your thoughts on the two headliners?
ACJ: So I recognize their songs, and I mean, I’m sure that there are a lot of other artists that would be better. But I would say that I’m excited, specifically excited about Bazzi, because I like “Mine” and “Beautiful.”
RR: If there were one realistic artist to headline artist, who would you choose?
ACJ: Jonas Brothers.
Michael B. Alber '21
RR: What are your thoughts on Yardfest as an event?
MBA: As an event, I think it’s a nice idea to organize something in the yard where everybody can have a good time, so I think the idea is good.
RR: What are your thoughts on the headliners?
MBA: I was very disappointed by the headliners because I think they’re bad. It’s not the type of music people really get excited to. It’s a bit more slow music.
Nina B. Elkadi '22
RR: What have your thoughts on Yardfest been so far?
NBE: Honestly, it’s been one of the best days of my life at Harvard so far, simply because I’ve seen so many wonderful people that I haven’t seen in a while, including but not limited to my FOP leaders, who are both really great people. Also, it’s nice to step back and spend time with friends.
RR: What have your thoughts on the headliners been?
NBE: They’re fine.
RR: What are your thoughts on the logistical setup with the food and everything?
NBE: I’m a little frustrated because I live in Thayer Hall, and it would be nice to go pop into my room and lie down for a second, go to the bathroom. But instead I’m confined to this space. I want to say I get it. I don’t really get it. But it’s been fine so far. There’s been a lot going on in here.
RR: If you could have any headliner, who would it be?
NBE: Well I heard there were rumors about Brockhampton. If that was the case, it would have been a really, really great time.
Marlena E. Skrabak ’22 and Katie J. Gao ’22
RR: Have you enjoyed Yardfest so far, for the little time that you’ve been here?
MES: We enjoy the food, and we very much enjoyed it from our dorm room, which the window has been open from as we study for the LS midterm.
KJG: We live in Thayer, so we’ve been hearing everything since 2:30.
RR: What made you guys not come to Yardfest until now?
KJG: Our midterm.
MES: We would’ve been here earlier. Probably earlier when it was warmer, too.
RR: What are your thoughts on the headliners?
KJG: Not my top choice, to be honest. There was a rumor floating around about Brockhampton coming...
MES: We would’ve screwed the midterm.
KJG: Unfortunately, not my cup of tea.
Gillian L. Meeks ’20 and Liam R. Hackett ’19
RR: What have your thoughts on Yardfest been so far?
GLM: I think it’s fun. I think it’s really cool that they have all of the food out here. I’m sure that it took a ton of planning.
LRH: Yeah, you can really tell that they put a lot into it. It’s a great day. I remember my sophomore year it was pouring rain and there was mud everywhere. The day’s perfect, and I think there’s a lot of backstory behind this year, so I understand that there’s some things that they had to do differently. I don’t know why the setup is different, but I’m sure they had their reasons, and they did their homework really well. I think it’s really fun.
RR: How do you think it compares to past years’ Yardfests?
GLM: It’s flipped!
Michael A. Miccioli ’22
RR: What are your general thoughts on Yardfest?
MAM: So far, it just seems like a pretty low-key event. Nothing too crazy, but I thought I might as well come.
RR: What are your thoughts on the headliners?
MAM: I’m actually not entirely sure who’s playing.
RR: What are your thoughts on the food?
MAM: Always appreciate the grilled cheese truck.
Andrew Huang ’21 and Jason Yoo ’21
RR: What are your general thoughts on Yardfest this year?
JY: I think it’s really exciting to see a band, Extra Extra, on stage[,] because I think they’re mostly freshmen. We’re keeping up with this annual tradition of allowing freshman to shine on this stage. Also, these artists are really well-known people with really cool hit songs, and I think everyone is going to vibe really well today.
RR: How do you feel about Yardfest as an event that brings the entire Harvard community together?
AH: Yeah. I think it’s a good time. You get to see a lot of people you don’t see for a while, and we really do need to have a specific, designated time to come together and really just have a good time together. I don’t think that happens enough.
