After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 8, 2015, at 4:39 p.m.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ sexual harassment procedures are likely to remain largely unchanged from a revised version presented at December’s Faculty meeting and will still remain within with the University’s central procedures, despite recent news that Harvard Law School adopted a set of procedures that break from that very standard.
History professor Alison Frank Johnson, who chaired the committee tasked with reviewing and making changes to the FAS sexual harassment procedures, said that since the faculty meeting, the committee has only altered some of the draft’s language for clarity. She added that any time the committee made a change to their draft, they consulted the University’s Office of the General Counsel to ensure that all revisions complied with federal Office for Civil Rights standards.
Johnson also said that she hopes the policy will be ready for review by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith by next week, noting that “the committee has more or less finished its work.”
The recommendations presented at December’s Faculty meeting included a number of significant changes to the interim FAS procedures unveiled this fall, stating that faculty and staff cases would be handled by a central University office—the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution—and that both cases of sexual harassment against individuals unaffiliated with Harvard and cases of quid pro quo sexual harassment within extracurricular student organizations would be subject to the FAS procedures.
Yet even with these changes, the FAS procedures always aligned with the University’s central procedures, which state that all student cases of sexual assault and harassment within the University would be investigated by the ODR.
Harvard Law School faculty members, in contrast, recently voted to adopt a new set of sexual harassment procedures that, if implemented, will deviate from University procedures by sidestepping ODR and incorporating a school-specific Title IX unit to investigate its own student sexual harassment cases and offer legal counsel to all parties involved. The procedures must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights as part of a recent agreement between the office and the Law School, which was found in violation of Title IX.
Johnson said she received a draft of the Law School’s new procedures prior to sharing her committee’s recommendations at the December Faculty meeting, yet made no substantial changes to the FAS policy after reading them.
She also said that, beyond requiring faculty and staff cases to be handled by the ODR, her committee had never considered departing from University procedures.
“When the University announced its policy and procedures, we were told that part of the purpose was to have a uniform policy and a uniform set of procedures for everyone in the University,” Johnson said, adding that she believes “there are real benefits... to having consistency across the schools.”
University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement last week that the Law School’s “distinct pedagogical mission and longstanding reliance on a different adjudicatory system for resolving disciplinary cases” motivated its departure from central procedures.
When asked if she thought the University may grant other schools the leeway to depart from central procedures, Johnson was uncertain.
“I wouldn’t guess that they would,” she said. “I would guess they would say we’ll work together as a University to have University-wide procedures through the review committee that we’re all happy with, rather than have each school or unit go its own way.”
FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an email that Smith was unable to comment as of the time of publication because he was out of the country.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: January 8, 2015
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article stated that Harvard Law School proposed a new set of sexual harassment procedures as part of its resolution agreement with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. To clarify, while the Law School consulted OCR when drafting the procedures, it was not a term of the resolution agreement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore forward Sydney Daniels has begun 2015 with a bang. Or, more precisely, with six of them.
In the first six days of the new year, Daniels has notched six goals for the Harvard women’s ice hockey team. During this stretch, the Crimson has played three games and won all three.
“Over break I got to work a lot with my dad, who has taught me almost everything I know,” Daniels said. “Having amazing, hardworking, and skilled teammates doesn’t hurt [either].”
The symbiotic relationship between Daniels’ scoring and Harvard’s success was on full display last Tuesday, when the Crimson (9-2-2, 7-1-1 ECAC) knocked around Connecticut (4-11-6, 0-5-3 HEA) en route to an 8-2 victory in Cambridge. Daniels scored a goal in each period to finish with the first hat trick of her collegiate career.
Despite Daniels’ dominant play, Harvard’s win resembled as much of a team performance as an individual effort. Ten different players recorded assists, five scored, and the Crimson rolled to its seventh straight victory.
“Each game we focus on what we need to do in order to win,” junior co-captain Michelle Picard said. “Every player [is] doing her part, and it’s been paying off…. Now we need to continue improving as the season continues.”
Midway through the first frame, however, the final result was far from certain.
Although Harvard jumped to an early 2-0 advantage, the hosts could only celebrate for 20 seconds. That’s how long it took Huskies forward Theresa Knutson to answer with a goal of her own, sparking a rare four-minute period in which Connecticut dictated the flow of the game and forced Crimson goalie Brianna Laing to make four of her 10 saves on the day.
“UConn never let down,” Picard said. “We needed to stay sharp to keep the lead [and] use our speed to attack and force them to keep up with us.’
Harvard freshman Lexie Laing, sister to Brianne, deflated any potential comeback. By scoring off an assist from senior defenseman Marissa Gedman and junior forward Mary Parker, Laing gave the Crimson a two-goal lead heading into the second period.
The Huskies never came closer.
For the game, Harvard outshot Connecticut 43-18, including a 20-6 advantage in the first frame. Fifteen different Crimson players fired a shot.
The contest became a rout in the third period, when Harvard racked up three goals in rapid succession. Parker scored before four minutes had elapsed, sophomore defenseman Abbey Frazer tallied her first goal of the season in a power-play opportunity, and Daniels capped the surge 15 seconds later with her third finish of the night.
“We were having a lot of fun creating and working in the offensive zone,” Daniels said. “In the third period, we wanted to show UConn what Harvard hockey is all about, and I think it was a good example.”
This good example also manifested itself in the first period, when the Crimson knocked in two goals in the first nine minutes. Senior forward Hillary Crowe struck first by scoring off an assist from junior forward Miye D’Oench and senior forward Samantha Reber after 3:18 of play. Five minutes later, Daniels nabbed her first goal of the game to give Harvard a 2-0 lead.
Out of the Crimson’s eight scores, only Daniels’s first-period finish was unassisted. Reber, D’Oench, and Geldman each passed out two assists.
The play looked least lopsided during the second frame, when Harvard hit only one more shot than Connecticut. But a one-shot difference proved significant, as the Crimson won the period 2-1 thanks to goals from Daniels and Laing.
Harvard has not lost since November 28, when the team fell to No. 1/1 Boston College. Since then, the team has ripped off seven consecutive victories by an average margin of over three goals.
“Hustle, hard work, relentless forechecking, tenacious backchecking, strong defense, and getting the puck on net and crashing are the goals that Coach Stone instills in us,” Daniels said. “Following her coaching leads us to all the successes we have had thus far…. I don’t expect us [to be] stopping any time soon.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patrick McNally has noticed something different around the Bright-Landry Hockey Center this season. Something other than the renovated locker rooms or expanded walkway. It’s something in the air.
“I think that it’s an atmosphere where everyone’s excited to play the next game,” said the fourth-year junior defenseman earlier this week. “In the past, maybe that excitement was kind of missing with almost a sense of, like, ‘We need to win.’”
Looking to improve on a seven-game winning streak, the No. 3/3 Harvard men’s hockey team will trade the confines of its Allston home for Madison Square Garden on Saturday night, when the Crimson (10-1-2, 6-1-2 ECAC) faces No. 19/- Yale (8-4-2, 4-3-1) in the second edition of the Rivalry On Ice game.
Over the past three months, Harvard has rekindled a culture of winning that had been missing for years. In November, the Crimson took out Hockey East’s top three teams on the road. In December, Harvard earned a decisive victory at Quinnipiac. And just last week, the Crimson stormed back from an early deficit to rout Rensselaer.
Harvard now sits No. 1 in every objective metric for nationally ranking college teams—win percentage, PairWise, RPI, KRACH, you name it. Naturally, positive vibes have been building around the squad and, according to McNally, have become self-reinforcing.
“You see the team during this streak, and everyone’s excited to go down to the rink, everyone’s upbeat,” McNally said. “I think that definitely helps with practice…and helps us get better.”
Neither McNally nor any of the other 30 players on the Crimson roster have been part of an intercollegiate streak like this. Prior to this year, Harvard’s program had not won seven straight games since the 2003-2004 season—the year before coach Ted Donato ’91 took the reins.
Among Donato’s tasks these days is an unanticipated yet welcome one: making sure that his players do not rest on their recent success.
“We weren’t picked especially positively by anybody at the beginning of the year, but we didn’t allow ourselves to get down,” Donato said. “On the flipside, I don’t think that we should be all too excited that we’re ranked higher now.”
Given the opponent, Harvard should not have a problem keeping an even keel going into Saturday’s game. After all, the Crimson’s only loss of the season is courtesy of Yale, and only a handful of seniors can say that they’ve beaten the Bulldogs. Junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo is quick to reject the “favorite” label when talking about the match-up.
“I wouldn’t necessarily say we’re the favorite,” Criscuolo said. “Yale got us earlier this year, so it’s always tough.”
Against Harvard, the Bulldogs have taken five straight games—the most recent one a 2-1 defensive clinic at the Bright-Landry on Nov. 15. Sophomore goaltender Alex Lyon gave the hosts fits, holding the Crimson scoreless until the game’s final seconds.
Since then, Harvard has been perfect, while Yale has had mixed success. The Bulldogs cracked the national rankings on Monday but blew a two-goal lead to a down-and-up Northeastern team the next day.
While coach Keith Allain’s squad has struggled to generate offense, Yale has made up for it with defense and discipline. The Bulldogs have received the fewest penalties in college hockey—28 fewer than the next closest Division I team—and before Tuesday, they were tied for the national lead in goals against average.
Overall, the national champion pedigree is still there—11 players on Yale’s current roster were on the 2013 NCAA title team.
“There’s a lot of character there,” said Donato of the Bulldogs. “[They have] a lot of moxie to perform in the toughest of games.”
In some ways, the Rivalry On Ice is just another regular season game. Saturday’s result will not even count for points in the conference standings.
Yet the game has quickly gained traction among fans in its first two years, perhaps challenging the Beanpot as Harvard’s premier mid-season showcase. Madison Square Garden announced a crowd of 15,524 at the game’s debut last year, and the schools’ alumni organizations will once again sponsor a number of activities surrounding the main event.
On the rink, the rivalry has also intensified. The recent history between the teams includes two playoff series in three years and plenty of chippiness to go around. After their last contest, Allain accused Crimson skaters of trying to rattle his star goaltender with hits and late shots. This week, McNally did not hesitate calling Yale his team’s “biggest rival.”
For Harvard men’s hockey, the Bulldogs have become the new Big Red.
“I think any time you play Yale, there’s a little added incentive to make sure you’re prepared when you go in and [to make sure you] know that it’s going to be an absolute war,” Criscuolo said. “And then adding on the fact that we’re playing at Madison Square Garden, there’s going to be a special feeling in the locker room going into the game.”
