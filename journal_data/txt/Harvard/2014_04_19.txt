After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
From April 17 to 19, Sayantan Deb ’14 will direct the first part of Tony Kushner’s play “Millennium Approaches: Angels in America Part 1” at the Adams Pool Theater. Although the play is set during the American AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and has three gay protagonists, Deb and the cast emphasize that “Angels” is not a play about being gay, but is rather a play about universal human relationships.
 
Deb thinks most audience members will be able to understand the experience of looking in from the outside, a theme the play addresses. “‘Angels’ is not about being gay in America…. The reason I wanted to do ‘Angels’ is because it is about being otherized in a nation that claims to be about everyone,” Deb says. Cast member Samantha A. Garin ’17 agrees. “It doesn’t really matter that it is a show on gay themes; it is just a great show that is being put up in the Pool and that happens to have gay themes in it.”
 
One of Deb’s directorial choices is the decision to have actors double as males and females. Alice Abracen ’15 views it as a paradoxical tool to makes the audience move beyond identifying people merely by their gender. “I am playing two different roles. One is a man and one is a woman…. whenever you see something like that, you have to question why has he pitted these two characters together,” Abracen says. “It gives you a great stance to see how these two characters are different besides their gender.”
 
“I think the show really does a great job of playing with the gender binary and forces us to ask, ‘What is a man, what is a woman?’” Garin says.
 
Deb chooses to focus on the the first half of Kushner’s play because it compels the audience to deal with an ambiguous future rather than giving them a clear answer to the questions brought up in “Angels.” “I think that Kushner quite brilliantly gets to a solution, but for me the resolution not being there was a statement of its own.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a busy week both on and off the field for Harvard athletes, including those not currently in season. The Back Page takes a closer look.
Harvard Fencers at Junior World Championships
 
While Harvard fencers compete for the Crimson during the season, much of their competition comes on the international circuit. When not in season, the majority of the team goes abroad to fence against some of the world’s best, and the level of fencing is generally understood to be higher than that of the NCAA.
Earlier this month, Harvard sophomore fencers Michael Woo, Aliya Itzkowitz, and Nina Van Loon travelled to Plovdiv, Bulgaria to compete in the 10-day Junior World Championships. The foilist Woo and épeéist Van Loon represented the United States and helped their teams to silver team medals, while Itzkowitz fenced for Great Britain.
Woo, who earned an All-American honorable mention and first-team Ivy League honors in the winter season, finished 19th after going 6-0 in pool play and winning his second round bout against Russia’s Bogdan Dascalu, 15-2.
After compiling a 4-2 pool record and the 35th seed, Van Loon would eventually fall to 30th-ranked Lizaveta Khlystunova of Bulgaria, 15-9, to finish her tournament 41st overall.
Fencing sabré, Itzkowitz finished 34th after also earning four bout victories and a plus-10 indicator. She would fall to Italy’s Sofia Ciaraglia in the round of 64.
Men’s Volleyball’s Bendell Garners Accolade
 
The Harvard men’s volleyball squad surpassed many preseason expectations by finishing a program best 11-3 in EIVA play this past season. Much of its success has stemmed from the contributions of freshmen Nick Bendell and Casey White. And earlier this week, Bendell was recognized for his efforts when he was named to the Off the Block/Springbak, Inc. Freshman All-American Team.
Playing the setter position, Bendell accounted for 733 of the Crimson’s 960 assists for the season and sits at seventh among the Crimson’s all-time assists leaders after just one season.
And he’s not yet finished, as the 6’2” star has another chance to add to his total when second-seeded Harvard takes on third-seeded University Park in the EIVA Tournament next Thursday.
Baseball’s Bald Benefit
 
After its 13-3 win over Brown last Sunday afternoon, the Crimson men got out the razors and left us all staring at a lot of forehead. There’s a saying in baseball that you don’t ever cut hair of any kind on game day, and especially not during a winning streak. Hopefully, the fact that the Harvard baseball squad members gave up their locks for cancer will appease the baseball gods.
Since the shave, which raised over $11,500 for the VS. Cancer Foundation, the Crimson has gone 1-1, splitting a Wednesday doubleheader at Princeton.

Ever wondered about Harvard's secret underground life? Although we weren’t allowed into the steam tunnels (turns out the 1000-degree steam is dangerous), Flyby took a tour of the HUDS food tunnels, beginning under the Leverett kitchen, wandering through Winthrop and Lowell, and ending below Kirkland and Eliot. Along the way, we took some snapshots. Enjoy!

“Populist.” “Aimed at the general public.” “Accessible.”
 The New York Times uses these words and phrases to describe Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker and the tests he gives his students. Fair enough. But if the Times wants to give its readers an accurate idea of Science of Living Systems 20, it’s missing a big chunk of the picture—exactly half, in fact.
Daniel Gilbert’s SLS 20 course, usually offered fall semester before Pinker’s spring counterpart, has earned recognition among students not for populism, direction to the common man, or accessibility. On the contrary, what words fit Gilbert’s instructional magnum opuses—his exams?
Esoteric. Aimed at overachieving brownnosers who read the textbook twice before class and 20 times before the test. Impenetrable.
Any Harvard student who has taken SLS 20 should feel ashamed to score anything less than, say, a 7/10 on the Times’ Pinker-style psychology pop quiz. A Gilbert evaluation, on the other hand—if you’re anything like me—should leave you wallowing in your own inferiority and tears. Focused on minor details, crafty tricks, and mostly mind reading, these tests are designed for students to score an average of 50 percent, and for them to feel miserable doing it. Here’s a sample:
1. Jimmy tells Joan that red-haired men like hotdogs more than men of any other hair color. Joan agrees because they just watched a Carrot Top routine about how much the comedian loves hotdogs. This is an example of:
a) the availability heuresticb) the availability hueristicc) the availability heuristic
2. In the popular television sitcom The Office, Jim powers on his computer and offers Dwight an Altoid mint multiple times. Then, Jim powers on his computer and does nothing. Dwight still extends his hand for an Altoid. What psychological concept does this illustrate?
a) classical conditioningb) Pavlovian psychologyc) a and bd) a, b, and ce) a and c but not bf) c, d, and e but not a and maybe b
3. The boy on page 261 of the course textbook, chapters of which, incidentally, I wrote, is wearing a blue shirt. With whom is he more likely to share the same sexual orientation?
a) a monozygotic twinb) a dizygotic twinc) a trizygotic twin with whom he slept in the same bed at age threed) a rate) a well-designed test should result in only 5% of the class getting an A
Answers: 1=a, 2=idk, 3=f u

First we had Thanksgivukkah—now “Weedster.” As most college students are probably aware, this year, Easter Sunday falls on 4/20, known to some as an unofficial day to celebrate with some, let’s say, recreational activities.
 
But before indulging in any sins on the most holy day of the Christian calendar, you might want to check out a recent study published in the Journal of Neuroscience. The study, released on Wednesday (how timely of them), found that even casual marijuana use, or smoking at least once a week, may lead to significant changes in the brain.
 
Granted, we’re guessing that it’s unlikely that these results will stop those who are so inclined from celebrating the holiday. So regardless of whatever your 4/20 or Easter plans may be, enjoy!
 
For those looking to celebrate the holy day, head over to Memorial Church for 8 and 11 a.m. Easter services, or enjoy a nice meal out in the Square, where many restaurants are hosting special brunches. And if you’re not planning on observing either holiday, note that the forecast calls for sun on Sunday. If that’s not reason to celebrate (enough with the overcast!), we don’t know what is.
