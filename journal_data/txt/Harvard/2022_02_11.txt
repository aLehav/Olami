After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crowds began to form on Massachusetts Avenue around 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 5, drawn to the sound of the Harvard University Band warming up for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 72nd Woman of the Year Parade. Cheers arose when members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals came running in a sea of baby bonnets, wigs, and frills galore — a sign that Jennifer Garner was near.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals has awarded the annual title of Woman of the Year to performers since 1951, recognizing those who have made significant contributions to the world of entertainment. Garner was selected this year for her talents as an actress, philanthropist, and entrepreneur. Garner’s “Juno” co-star Jason Bateman was named Hasty Pudding’s 2022 Man of the Year to celebrate his impact in television and film.
For the first time in Hasty Pudding history, the 2022 Woman of the Year celebrations coincided with opening night of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ new production, “Ship Happens.” This was also the first Woman of the Year Parade to be held since the onset of the pandemic; Viola Davis, the 71st recipient, was honored with a short virtual roast in 2021. Among the hundreds that braved the 23-degree weather to watch, the anticipation was palpable.
“I’ve seen pictures of past parades, but I’m so excited to see it in person,” said observer Emily Parke ‘24.
What followed was described by Boston resident Cyrus H. Miceli as both “chaotic and entertaining.” Garner rode in a red Bentley convertible, accompanied by a feather-clad and bonnet-donning Pudding cast member on either side. Onlookers in the street scrambled over snow banks to get better views and photo angles of the star. Lucky residents of Fairfax Hall caught Garner’s attention with a plush figure that they threw from their dorm room window. Fans shouted “We love you!” and “Jennifer, you’re so beautiful!” from the sidelines. Another held a “13 Going on 30”-inspired poster. The crowd joined the flow of the parade, walking and dancing with members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals from the Inn at Harvard to the end of the 40-minute route at Farkas Hall.
For some, the event was a pleasant surprise.
“We stumbled across this one,” said Sierra M. Chiao, a Wellesley student. “We weren’t expecting to see Jennifer Garner — but what a wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon! ‘13 Going on 30’ is a cultural masterpiece.”
Later that evening, Garner received her Pudding Pot at a celebratory roast held at Farkas Hall. The roast was written by Maureen Clare ‘23-24 and former Arts Chair Kalos K. Chu ‘22-23 and delivered by Molly Chiang ‘23 and Lucy Goldfarb ‘23. Clare and Chu, however, were presented with a challenge: How could anyone ridicule this award-winning actress, Save the Children Trustee, and co-founder of Once Upon a Farm, an organic food company intent on providing children with nutritious and sustainable snacks?
The solution? Don’t roast her.
While Garner sat beaming in a plush white chair, Chiang and Goldfarb voiced their frustrations about not being able to come up with hard-hitting insults. The two joked that the worst they could think of was to say that the Instagram videos of Garner’s dogs are “only mildly entertaining.” As an alternative, Chiang and Goldfarb asked Garner to play a game with rules inspired by her recent film “Yes Day” — she had to say yes to everything they asked, starting with a request for the story of her first kiss.
Garner proceeded to enjoy the shenanigans, pretending to play “Sally the Sexy Saxophone” while an orchestra member produced sounds from the pit. Isabella E. Peña ‘23-24 made an appearance as Lucifer Garner, Garner’s evil twin who claims to be the reason she’s as “wholesome as she is.” Garner was told to banish Peña from the stage by dumping packets of Once Upon a Farm’s baby food over her head, resulting in uproarious laughter from the crowd.
Her final onstage encounter was with “13 Going on 30” mean girl Tom-Tom, played by Kyra Siegal ‘25. Siegal threw glitter at Garner, turning her into a thirteen-year-old and disqualifying her from receiving the Pudding Pot. Only after performing her classic dance to “Thriller” from the film was Garner able to return to adulthood and receive her award.
“I guarantee my day was better than yours,” said Garner after receiving the Pudding Pot, giving it a kiss.
At a press conference after the roast, Garner reflected on a day well spent with members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals.
“The day has been one surprise and one total delight after another. I got a tour this morning, I was serenaded by the Krokodiloes, which I loved,” said Garner. “I just have grown very attached to this group of kids in one day, and so that was really special.”
Garner also had a message for future honorees. “Get ready to have a blast. I mean, what could I tell them? Stay home and send me instead,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day is Monday, Jan. 10. International Holocaust Remembrance Day is just a couple of weeks away. The McMinn County School Board in eastern Tennessee is wrapping up a special meeting. The only item on the agenda? “Discussion of Eighth Grade ELA Curriculum.” The verdict? A unanimous decision to ban “Maus” from the district’s eighth grade classrooms.
“Maus” is a graphic novel by Art Spiegelman which depicts his father’s experiences as a Polish Holocaust survivor. In 2016, celebrating the novel’s thirtieth anniversary, “master of the comic art form” Chris Ware deemed “Maus” the “greatest graphic novel ever written.” Despite its status as the only graphic novel to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize, “Maus” was banned by the district because it contains nudity and curse words.
At the beginning of the meeting, County Director of Schools Lee Parkinson explained that in consultation with an attorney, he had already decided to redact the book’s use of profanity, as well as an objectionable line drawing of a woman. However, members of the board had additional concerns.
One board member who loudly voiced his opposition to the book was Tony Allman. Allman took issue with both the “vulgar and inappropriate behavior” shown in “Maus” and the use of objectionable language.
“Being in the schools, educators and stuff, we don’t need to enable or somewhat promote this stuff,” said Allman. “It shows people hanging, it shows them killing kids. Why does the educational system promote this kind of stuff? It is not wise or healthy.”
It is difficult to understand how someone who considers himself an “educator and stuff,” can equate teaching students about the Holocaust with promoting its atrocities. The essential need for young people to learn about the Holocaust, however disturbing, calls to mind the adage, “Those who do not know history are destined to repeat it.”
Allman went on to criticize the graphic novel’s inappropriate language and nudity:
“It’s like when you’re watching TV and a cuss word or nude scene comes on,” he said. “It would be the same movie without it. Well, this would be the same book without it.”
In fact, it would not. The county’s Pre-K to Eighth Grade Supervisor Melasawn Knight argued against Allman:
“People did hang from trees, people did commit suicide, and people were killed. Over six million were murdered,” said Knight. “I think the author is portraying that because it is a true story about his father. He is trying to portray that the best he can… maybe to help people who haven’t been in that aspect in time to actually relate to the horrors of it.”
I read “Maus” in school. Personally, I struggled with its core metaphor of Jews as frightened mice and Nazis as menacing cats. People of different religions, ethnicities, and nationalities are not different species. You don’t fault a cat for killing a mouse; it is acting on centuries of evolutionary instinct. The horror of the Holocaust lies in the fact that human beings brutalized other human beings, and neighbors turned on their neighbors, condemning adults and children alike to their deaths. But you don’t have to like something to defend it.
Antisemitism is on the rise in the United States and throughout the world. FBI statistics revealed that in 2020, 58% of all religiously motivated hate crimes committed in the U.S. targeted the Jewish community. “Maus” is an important book, the Holocaust is an important topic, and a graphic novel has the potential to be a uniquely suitable format for teaching 13- and 14-year-olds about such sensitive yet crucial subject matter.
The dangers of censorship are, of course, not limited to the Holocaust. For instance, individuals in Cheyenne, Wyoming recently lobbied for criminal charges to be brought against librarians for making books about sexuality and sexual orientation available to young readers. Unsurprisingly, Wyoming is currently ranked the second least welcoming state in the nation for BGLTQ residents.
Similarly, a bill was introduced in the Oklahoma State Senate at the end of last year banning public school libraries from “having or promoting books that address the study of sex, sexual preferences, [and] sexual activity.” The bill would allow parents to individually report books and seek monetary damages of at least $10,000 per day if the book in question is not removed. Oklahoma has the fourth highest rate of teen pregnancy in the country. It is in the exact places where information is needed that efforts are underway to ensure it is intentionally withheld.
A nationwide survey on Holocaust knowledge among Millennials and Gen Z was released by the Claims Conference in 2020. In Tennessee, home to McMinn County, 52% of its respondents were unable to name a single one of the more than 40,000 concentration camps and ghettos once littered across Europe. 44% did not know what Auschwitz was, 66% did not know that over 6 million Jews were murdered, and 16% believed Jews caused the Holocaust. These results demonstrate the critical need for Holocaust education.
Encouragingly, 78% of the young Tennesseeans surveyed “believe it is important to continue teaching about the Holocaust, in part so that it doesn’t happen again” — a higher percentage than in California. Kids across the country want to be educated, making it all the more infuriating that there are adults working so hard to prevent them from becoming so.
In a hopeful turn of events, the national press arising from the board’s decision has brought renewed attention to the “Maus” series. Small businesses from across the country have offered free copies of the book to students in the McMinn area. Within just three days of the first reports of the ban, “The Complete Maus” had climbed to #4 on the Amazon bestseller list. As I write this piece, it sits at #2. One tweet brilliantly captures the ban’s unintended consequences:
“I'd never heard of #Maus before, but I just bought it... Thanks, Tennessee school board, and enjoy watching sales skyrocket for every book you ban.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most people, a season of newness is coupled with a cluster of future plans. Whether it’s a new workout regimen, new goals for a relationship, or — as is typical for Harvard students — a new academic approach in pursuit of a 4.0 grade point average, we as humans love to plan for a better future. But that is where the problem lies. We love to plan more than we love to do.
It’s a known fact. This past semester, I learned about the behavioral economics of procrastination and present bias through Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics (Microeconomics).” Though this course is a fan favorite at Harvard, it doesn’t take a class to make most of us aware of our delaying tendencies. We procrastinate every day in our lives — and if you’re like me, multiple times every day. But how did I plan on tackling this problem? By making one of my New Year’s resolutions to stop procrastinating.
There’s this quote by Cornelius Fichtner that’s very popular in vision boards across the nation: “Planning without action is futile, action without planning is fatal.” I disagree. Planning without action is the furthest thing from futile; in fact, it’s even more fatal than action without planning. When time ticks away without a single move made, planning without action wastes potential to the point of no return. One of the worst things someone can do is trap themself in a continuous loop of planning without ever acting.
Such an endless cycle of planning without acting is worse than acting on every opportunity presented — no matter if it ends up good or bad. Either way, you’d learn something about yourself and/or the world. Lessons are best learned actively. Reading something or being told something just doesn’t register the same as experiencing it. Think back to when you learned how to ride a bike. Whether your parents held onto the handlebars alongside you until you got the hang of it, or you started off with a tricycle, then matured to training wheels, and then finally the real thing, at some point you physically rode a bike. Now imagine you had read books and watched videos about riding a bike instead. Does that translate into you being a good bike rider? This has been the subject of much philosophical debate in the form of the thought experiment Mary’s Room.
Yet I, like many others, lean towards planning over acting. It’s easy to be comfortable with where you are physically, financially, and academically. It’s even easier to wish and plan for a better future. It’s much, much harder to start living for the future you want. In order to really achieve the lives we so desire, we need to impulsively create change. Only our impulses break the planning loop and allow us to reach our end goals. The best things often come on a whim.
An impulse made me apply to Harvard. An impulse made me meet my best friends here. An impulse made me take my favorite course, English 179H: “The Harvard Novel,” last term. Impulses are good. They open up possibilities you never even knew existed. An impulsive decision has the ability to transform your life for the better, by pushing you beyond your steady and safe, but limiting and terminal, comfort zone. You can experience new things, as opposed to merely thinking about them, and so you can grow in a way that endlessly planning will never achieve. Impulses prove that you are not a passing spectator in your own life, just going through the motions, but the fully autonomous protagonist, free to alter your life in any way you so choose. The ability to be instinctive is a testament to being alive. From familial expectations to surrounding limitations, in life, it’s easy to follow the path that has been created for you. Spontaneity means straying from the path and forging your own.
This semester, I’m ditching the planner in me and embracing the compulsions. I don’t want to overthink everything. Especially at an institution like Harvard, opportunities are all around us. If we shy away from things because they don’t fall neatly into our perfectly drafted life plans, we lose in the end.
Being impulsive pays off. Change doesn’t come from planning; it comes from simply doing, and continuing to do. Planning is always going to be a part of our lives, but does it have to encompass every part? There is so much more than what we can imagine in the months before the start of something new. Why should we withhold the joy of unprecedented experience from ourselves?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s community engagement report card is in. Just one problem — Harvard wrote it. Harvard’s latest Town Gown report, submitted to the City of Cambridge, describes the University’s investments in the city, partnerships with city organizations, and general goals around sustainability and equity. We welcome the report because it details the inadequacy of Harvard’s community engagement when measured against the harm that comes from the University’s massive footprint in Cambridge.
In thinking about the University’s impacts on Cambridge, however, we feel that there is a lot more Harvard can do. Take homelessness, for example. Housing insecurity is a big issue in Cambridge and Boston writ large, but it is also something that we’re sure many of us have seen on a daily basis in Harvard Square. The University is not responsible for addressing homelessness writ large, but it can address the issue locally, starting with removing anti-homeless benches. These quotidian things may seem small and often slip our minds, but nowhere is the contrast between Harvard’s liberal words and conservative actions thrown into more jarring relief.
Granted, not every Town/Gown tradeoff is so clearcut. Harvard’s presence in Cambridge brings hundreds of millions of dollars into the region; we don’t dispute that. Instead, we take issue with the distribution of those resources. The Presidential Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery is all well and good, but can we claim that Harvard has cleared its balance with Black Cantabridgians while Harvard’s aggressive expansion drives gentrification throughout its environs?
That expansion has benefits, to be sure. It seems a fair bet that more than one discovery made in the SEC will one day significantly advance the wellbeing of humanity. But once again, we have to think about the distribution of harm. The benefits of Harvard’s research will be spread diffusely across the world, while the harms of its expansion are overwhelmingly felt by underprivileged communities around Allston and Cambridge.
Divining the nature of those harms isn’t rocket science. We need only listen to residents to hear that Harvard’s level of collaboration with Allston residents while planning its expansion there was “deeply disappoint[ing].” The consequences of that level of collaboration spread from the long-term environmental future of the city to its acute and ongoing housing problems. It shouldn’t be surprising that the welfare of the region, today and going forward, will depend heavily on the decisions of an institution that owns nearly 10 percent of the land in Cambridge and added 10 times more to its endowment last year than Cambridge spent in its annual budget.
Going forward, Harvard should think very carefully about each instance of expansion. Is a new building going up because of urgent and insuperable need, or because a donor needs a monument to stave off the sudden realization of their mortality? When a real need exists, can it be satisfied by retrofitting or more efficiently using existing space? Given that many of the costs of new building are borne by others, any institution would tend to default toward building more than socially optimal. Harvard must actively combat that instinct.
Additionally, if a need is found to clear the high bar of necessity, what investment in the community is necessary to make sure that no one is made worse off in Harvard’s pursuit of ever-greater reach? Sometimes, that investment will require providing aid directly to those most affected by the gentrification and displacement attendant with expansion. It will always require a level of community collaboration that reflects Harvard’s unique social responsibilities as both a seeker of truth and a vast reserve of wealth.
As people who often call Harvard our home away from home, we must recognize that Harvard’s investment in the city it calls home is inadequate. It must be expanded significantly, and it is partly up to us to remind Harvard that. When we enjoy the comfort of making our homes here, remember: Cambridge is home to so many people before us and outside of our Harvard bubble. Cambridge is not some theme park built exclusively for our amusement, only relevant as the backdrop to our lives here as Harvard students. This city, like any other, has and will continue to contain the lifetimes of so many communities and generations. The least we and Harvard can do is recognize and respect that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My freshman year, I ran across a soggy, wet poster, taped to an announcement board in the Yard.
“Life Matters,” it read.
A few days later, I attended the conference of this name: a life-transforming public conversation featuring guest speaker Cornel R. West ’74, whom I had never heard of before the event. An unashamed Christian and an unflinching Democratic Socialist, West beautifully orated the meaning of love, the necessity of refusing to conform, and the radical-revolutionary power of Jesus Christ, which required him to love “the least of these.” He coupled his love for Christ with a resistance to homophobia, to inequality, to white supremacy and militarism, in a way I had never heard before. He put Harvard’s two sides, the school at its best — a place that develops and challenges students to think outside of the box and imagine a new, more just world — and at its worst — a merch-producing, “Harvardite”-creating school emblematic of social stratification, global exploitation, and superficial “learning” — at odds, uplifting its better side.
These ideas were all new to me. In 1918, my great grandfather, Chester Morgan, traveled to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to establish the first Church of God in Christ in the state. Years down the road, Colorado Springs would grow to become the evangelical world’s “Christian mecca.” It hosted a wide range of conservative faith-based organizations. My mother grew up in the historically Black Church of God in Christ, but in exploration of her own faith, turned to what was available in the surrounding, white-evangelical world. She found refreshing theology and a new angle that seemed more systematic, with more emphasis on scripture and seemingly less unnecessary rules and regulations.
I grew up as a Black church boy transplanted in white churches. My Christianity — though it emphasized salvation by grace through faith, as a beautiful gift separate from anything one could earn — took on a white, conservative worldview. I quickly learned the rules of some white, non-denominational churches. Topics of race? Insignificant. God didn’t see color. We needed to talk out against abortion and same-sex marriage instead. This so-called “Christian worldview” was venomous. As I grew in knowledge, my autonomy, my perspective — subconsciously, perhaps — was diminishing. In a new, racialized way, I re-learned the legalism my mom so desperately ran from at my age. So long as I didn’t handle that, touch those, or, God forbid, look at that, I would be fine. The only problem was, too often, the unspoken “that” was tied to just existing. I learned the subtle delicacies which I — a tall Black boy at the time — had to follow for acceptance.
Thus, when I heard Cornel West speak — being the Bible-quoting, politically startling, free, intellectual Black man that he is — I was shaken to the core.
He helped me see that I could both be a Black Christian and hate homophobia. I could be a Black Christian and be race-conscious. I could be a Black Christian and call out injustice. I could be confident, even if it made others uncomfortable. And, as a matter of fact, it wasn’t just that I could be — it was that I should be.
This way of Christianity seemed more real to me.
The following semester, I enrolled in African and African American Studies 10: “Introduction to African American Studies” with Professor West. The class introduced me to one of West’s favorite Greek words, “paideia”: a deep, painful educational experience that requires death to oneself. The type of education that makes us question who we are. I remember reading the three “pillars” of the class: Lorraine Hansberry, W. E. B. Du Bois, and James Baldwin, and finally seeing my feelings and experiences fleshed out on paper and pen. I brought the books home to my mother, who had read them, but long ago, and watched as she re-awakened. We left my church and helped start a new booming, multi-ethnic, justice-oriented church in Colorado Springs.
Then, Cornel West requested to be reviewed for tenure. Shockingly, it was denied. He left.
In unflinchingly speaking out on behalf of the oppressed, Cornel West found himself in trouble with Harvard. In an interview with The Crimson, West rightly identifies himself as an “undisciplinable” — one who refuses to conform to an institution’s expectations — and that is just what he is. The fact that Cornel West is gone is a tragedy for current and future Black Harvard students, but it is no surprise. He did not belong here. But in his leaving, Professor West left a flame just bright enough to kindle prophetic fire in those students ready to answer the call and hold Harvard to its better side, envisioning a brighter future.

The Harvard Graduate School of Education received the largest donation in its 102-year history last week.
Provided by two anonymous Harvard Business School alumni, the gift includes a direct $30 million and an offer to match up to $10 million in additional donations. The donors earmarked the funds to provide scholarships for the school’s newly redesigned master’s program, Teaching and Teacher Leadership.
HGSE Dean Bridget T. Long said the school has already made progress toward raising the additional $10 million in donations to fulfill the matching offer. She noted she has worked with the two donors since the beginning of her tenure as dean and has engaged in discussions about the gift since last fall.
“I was incredibly, incredibly pleased — overjoyed is probably a better word — of their generosity and our ability to secure this gift,” Long said.
Heather C. Hill, one of the program's co-chairs, recounted the moment she heard the news of the record-breaking donation.
“My jaw had dropped. I was on the floor — all of it, the whole nine yards,” she said.
Her co-chair Victor M. Pereira Jr. said the gift would allow a diverse cohort of current and future teachers to learn in the new master’s program.
“Simply put, it removes a barrier,” Pereira said.
Launching in 2022, the new master’s program combines three previous HGSE programs — the Harvard Teacher Fellows, the master’s-level Teacher’s Education Program, and the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program. It provides two tracks — one that allows novice and early-career teachers to earn their teaching certification and another for experienced teachers that focuses on developing leadership skills.
Long said the gift demonstrates an investment in teaching after public support for teachers has been “chipped away” over the last two years.
She added she hopes the donation will “send a signal about how important the profession is, and how important it is for all of us, for all organizations and individuals, to recognize and support and invest in our teachers.”
Since the donors were not HGSE alumni, Long pointed to the gift as an example of cross-school investment, a trend she said she hopes will continue.
“We have incredible, incredible alumni working all across the education ecosystem, but they don’t traditionally have the kinds of salaries that other schools’ alumni have, and so we do have to be reliant and casting a wide net and I think they’re sending that signal,” she said.
Long also said donations to HGSE have a far-reaching impact.
“When you invest in one of our students, you’re not only investing in one person, you’re investing in all the other students and families and communities that they then go on to help,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two years after the Ivy League first canceled its season due to Covid-19, Harvard varsity athletics are inching toward normalcy.
Harvard athletics resurrected last fall with a full competition schedule after a four-season hiatus. Since the long-awaited return, Harvard’s varsity student-athletes have reported mixed experiences practicing and playing during a pandemic.
Noah A. Kirkwood ’22, a guard on Harvard men’s basketball team, said it was difficult returning to the sport after the canceled season because he was “fully removed from basketball” last year.
“I still feel like right now I’m getting used to playing again and getting my rhythm back, but it was definitely tough,” Kirkwood said.
At one point over winter break, seven players — including Kirkwood — tested positive for Covid-19, he said. With so many players out, the team had to postpone a game against Princeton and cancel their game against the University of Kansas.
Margaret P. “Maggie” McCarthy ’23, who plays on both the women’s basketball and lacrosse teams, said Covid-19 has fortunately not affected their gameplay.
“We didn't have to have any games postponed luckily, but some of the teams we played had players with [Covid-19] and that caused some nerves within people,” McCarthy said. “Our coaching staff and training staff did a really good job at keeping people calm, so luckily it hasn’t affected our season so far.”
Other student-athletes reported public health guidelines have impacted team camaraderie.
Allaura M. Osborne ’25, a thrower on the track and field team, said Covid-19 restrictions have limited her ability to get to know her team.
“This is a really large team,” Osborne said. “It’s been really hard to just bond with the teammates and actually see everyone because we are trying to be Covid-cautious.”
Despite limited team bonding events, Osborne said that “the coaches have done everything that they can to build that community.”
Harvard men’s lacrosse player Jake E. Brownley ’25, on the other hand, said he believes the ongoing pandemic has brought the team closer together rather than farther apart.
“I feel like team bonding hasn’t been affected at all,” Brownley said. “If anything, I think it all brings us closer because you’re only supposed to be around your teammates and the guys that you hang out with the most so you don’t catch anything or spread anything.”
Brownley also said that the coaching staff has been focused on enforcing safety guidelines and keeping players healthy so that they are able to compete.
“They’re always harping on us wearing masks and keeping distance,” Brownley said. “Obviously haven’t had a real season in a while, so that’s the only thing on their minds, is making sure that we’re following the rules and that they’re keeping us safe so we can play this year.”
Kirkwood lauded University Covid-19 testing protocols and said he is excited to have supporters return to the stands. Harvard announced last month it would welcome spectators back to indoor competitions, as long as they show proof of vaccination.
“We were so fortunate to have the fans come out to the Penn game and watch us play,” Kirkwood said. “It’s always a great atmosphere to have them back.”

The City of Cambridge’s Planning Board approved a special permit application for the Garage's renovation process Tuesday, clearing the path for the next step in the historic landmark’s redevelopment.
Trinity Property Management, the developer that owns The Garage, was granted special approval pursuant to six zoning codes, including renovating the existing structure into a six-story building.
The Garage — one of the oldest structures in Harvard Square — was constructed as a horse stable in the 1860s and later used as a parking garage. It was last renovated in 1972 when it was converted into a shopping mall.
Trinity Property Management owner John P. DiGiovanni unveiled a plan last year meant to pay homage to the building's historic presence in the Square. The plan was granted a Certificate of Appropriateness by the Cambridge Historical Commission in June 2021.
Jason J. Jewhurst, the lead architect of the proposed renovation, said the plan balances the historic importance of the building with modern features and “reimagines a future for a memorable and active contributor for Harvard Square for decades to come.”
DiGiovanni discussed the building’s current state, saying that modern changes to the shopping mall are needed.
“Its interior food court and internal ramps, both relics of an early era, make it less appealing and, quite frankly, less accessible to people today,” he said, “It is no longer engaged in the life of Harvard Square as it once was.”
The proposed development will retain the original masonwork of the gable facade and will feature basement entertainment capacity, office space, and six outdoor terraces, according to Trinity’s website.
Harvard professor Suzanne P. Blier, who is president of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, thanked the developers at Trinity for their communication.
“It’s been really wonderful to have this terrific collaboration,” she said.
Harvard Square resident Philip A. Borden said he applauds the developers for their proposed renovations.
“We are very, very appreciative of how this developer has communicated directly with residents like us all throughout the design process,” he said.
During the hearing, some members of the planning board expressed concerns over the type of tenants who would be occupying the new space. Steven A. Cohen, a member of the planning board, said first floor tenants should encourage foot traffic.
“I would like to make sure that there are rules and restrictions there for this project so that the first floor shall be, and will always be, retail and not office space,” he said.
In response, the board added an amendment mandating all first floor storefronts to hold “active” residents, meaning non-office space establishments.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she was “delighted” with the board’s decision to approve the permit.
As for disturbances to Harvard Square during the construction, Jillson pointed to the potential economic benefit for local restaurants with the influx of construction jobs to the area.
“We’ll put up with a disruption and hope that all the construction workers are very hungry,” Jillson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds said at an event Thursday she regrets initially signing onto a letter that questioned the results of misconduct investigations into professor John L. Comaroff, who is accused of sexual harassment.
Hammonds, a professor of African and African American Studies, moderated a discussion with Anita Hill, a professor at Brandeis University who was thrust into the public spotlight 30 years ago when she accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. The event, which focused on gender-based violence, was hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
Harvard is reeling over allegations of sexual misconduct against Comaroff, who was placed on unpaid leave in January after University investigations found that he violated the school’s sexual and professional conduct policies.
Hammonds, who served as the dean of Harvard College from 2008 to 2013, signed onto an open letter last week that questioned the results of the misconduct investigations into Comaroff. But after a lawsuit filed Tuesday detailed years of sexual misconduct allegations against Comaroff, Hammonds retracted her support for the original message, along with most other professors who initially signed it.
“This has been a difficult soul-searching moment,” she said at the event Thursday. “After receiving additional information, I retracted my name from the statement. And I want to state that I absolutely stand with the students in this case. And I want to state that I completely support them and I applaud their enormous courage in bringing their charges forward and making these charges known to us all.”
Some of the allegations against Comaroff that were detailed in Tuesday’s lawsuit had been reported previously in The Crimson and the Chronicle of Higher Education.
At the start of the event, Radcliffe Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin said some Radcliffe affiliates had called for the discussion to be canceled in light of the Comaroff controversy.
“A conversation on the issue of gender-based violence with Anita Hill, who has spoken truth to power for 30 years could not be more important today,” she said. “My position is that as an institution of higher education, we must seize opportunities to explore issues like this and to engage deeply and openly we have an obligation to engage thoughtfully with one another. And it is my hope that this afternoon’s conversation provides an opportunity for us to do precisely that.”
After introducing Hill, Hammonds said she regrets signing the letter.
“What I believed at the time was a lack of transparency with respect to very important and essential processes,” she said. “The letter, though, has been read as supporting the accused and questioning the veracity of the students who brought forth the charges. That was never what I intended, and I truly regret signing the letter.”
The conversation centered around the launch of Hill’s book, “Believing: Our Thirty-Year Journey to End Gender Violence,” which explores the mechanisms of gender-based violence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 11, 2022 at 4:29 p.m.
As the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences enters the third year of its five-year Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging plan and undergoes multiple leadership transitions, students and faculty look toward future progress.
SEAS announced its DIB plan in 2019 in a report drafted by the Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. Alexis J. Stokes, then-assistant dean for diversity, inclusion, and belonging, led the team before departing SEAS in December 2021 to assume the position of Harvard’s associate chief diversity and inclusion officer.
One of the committee’s priorities was developing an interactive DIB dashboard that would enable SEAS to effectively diagnose disparities, according to the committee’s website. However, leadership transitions delayed the interactive dashboard’s publication, which was scheduled for fall 2021.
“Some of the main obstacles, or some of the reasons the timeline got pushed back, was that we were searching for an institutional research analyst,” Stokes said. “This would be the data person within the SEAS community that would be helping to launch that dashboard.”
Christina Z. Patel, who stepped up as the interim assistant director for diversity, inclusion, and belonging at SEAS last month, said turnover in administrative faculty is part of “the nature of Harvard” and acknowledged that these transitions can “slow some things down.”
Patel lauded Stokes’s work, adding that it “makes absolute sense” that she would transition into the University’s central administration given its desire to standardize the protocols governing diversity, inclusion, and belonging across its multiple schools.
As for who will serve as Stokes’ permanent replacement, Patel said she favors a candidate with previous experience in tackling issues of diversity and inclusion.
“Being able to engage the community and actually participating in some of these efforts I think is something really that — that’s what we would want in a DIB leader,” she said.
Some students still argue more needs to be done to realize diversity, inclusion, and belonging at SEAS, following a 2018 climate survey that revealed 27 percent of students at the school had experienced discrimination or harassment. Patel said one of her goals as interim assistant director is to administer an updated SEAS climate survey.
Isaac A. Robinson ’23, a fellow in the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, said that SEAS faces many of the same challenges as its peer institutions. He added that he has experienced firsthand the school’s lack of representation.
“It’s sometimes strange to look around, especially my advanced courses, and see that I'm kind of the only person that looks like me there,” Robinson said. “That is something that I would like to see change.”
Another fellow, Shi Le Wong ’22, said that she got involved in DIB at SEAS after “poking around” the SEAS website and later applied to be a fellow when she saw it publicized over email.
“Before I became a fellow, I was definitely not aware of the various channels through which this kind of work was being done,” she said. “Various channels in which I could be heard.”
Soyoun “Soy” Choi ’23, who serves as president of the Harvard Society of Women Engineers, said she has not personally experienced discrimination but has heard anecdotes from members in her organization surrounding professors making “hurtful” remarks about the lack of female students in engineering courses.
“I feel that it’s not with malicious intent,” Choi said. “It comes naturally to them. They might feel like they are stating something obvious, but it puts a lot of pressure on minority groups.”
Manciana Cardichon ’23, vice president of the Harvard Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, said there is “definitely some room for improvement” with regard to diversity in SEAS faculty and advising.
Cardichon added that she hopes the next assistant dean will empathize with the unique experiences and challenges minority students face.
“One of the most important things in terms of traits is just empathy, being able to understand where we are coming from as Black students in STEM and understanding that our experiences have another layer to them because we’re Black,” she said.
SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff reaffirmed the school’s commitment to “inclusive excellence” in an emailed statement.
“While we are proud of the important steps we have taken and progress made toward becoming a more diverse and welcoming community, we recognize that there is much more to do,” he wrote. “In fact, this work will never be done.”

Harvard is back in the news for a sexual misconduct controversy.
The school is reeling this week in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment against a powerful professor and of sweeping failures in its Title IX processes.
The controversy came to a head on Tuesday when three graduate students filed a federal lawsuit against Harvard claiming the school ignored reports of sexual misconduct against professor John L. Comaroff for years.
Less than 36 hours after the suit was filed, 34 faculty members retracted their support for a letter they had signed just days earlier that questioned the results of misconduct investigations into Comaroff, a professor of African and African American Studies and Anthropology. The signatories included some of Harvard’s best-known scholars.
Here’s what you need to know about the controversy.
Sexual misconduct allegations against Comaroff first emerged publicly in May 2020 when The Crimson reported that three students were in contact with Harvard’s Title IX Office about allegations of unwanted touching, verbal sexual harassment, and professional retaliation by Comaroff.
A lawsuit filed against Harvard on Tuesday by three graduate students in the Anthropology Department detailed over a decade of alleged misconduct by Comaroff.
The complaint — filed by Margaret G. Czerwienski, Lilia M. Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava — charges that Harvard failed to prevent Comaroff’s misbehavior, despite receiving reports of harassment and retaliation.
Comaroff allegedly sexually harassed and threatened Kilburn and retaliated against Czerwienski and Mandava for speaking to others about his behavior, according to the suit.
Comaroff, who is not named in the suit, denies the claims. In a statement Tuesday, his lawyers — Norman S. Zalkin, Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, and Janet E. Halley — wrote that he “categorically denies ever harassing or retaliating against any student.”
“Attacks on his career based on gossip and fantasy rather than actual evidence are shameful,” the lawyers wrote.
In August 2020, after The Crimson reported on the allegations against Comaroff, Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay placed him on paid administrative leave pending an investigation into his behavior.
Gay announced last month that Comaroff would be placed on unpaid administrative leave after the school’s investigations found that he violated sexual harassment and professional conduct policies. Comaroff is barred from teaching required courses, taking on additional advisees, or chairing any dissertation committees through the next academic year.
Gay’s sanctions were based on two separate investigations Harvard conducted into Comaroff — one by the school’s Office for Dispute Resolution and another by the FAS. Gay’s sanctions were based on the results of both inquiries.
According to the lawsuit filed Tuesday, the ODR probe did not recommend sanctions against him. After its conclusion, the lawsuit said, the FAS hired an outside factfinder who found that Comaroff violated the FAS Professional Conduct Policy.
After Gay announced the sanctions against Comaroff last month, his legal team claimed that Harvard mishandled its investigations. In a press release, Comaroff’s lawyers wrote that Harvard opened a “second, kangaroo court process” — referring to the FAS probe — to reexamine conduct that had already been thoroughly investigated in the Title IX process.
The Tuesday lawsuit alleged that Harvard mishandled the probes in other ways. The suit said Harvard allowed “its investigatory process to be used in service of Professor Comaroff’s campaign of professional blacklisting.”
Harvard denies the claims in the suit. In a statement Wednesday evening, Rachael Dane, a spokesperson for the school, wrote that the allegations “are in no way a fair or accurate representation of the thoughtful steps taken by the University in response to concerns that were brought forward, the thorough reviews conducted, and the results of those reviews.”
Last week, prior to the lawsuit, 38 Harvard faculty members signed onto an open letter questioning the results of the University’s investigations into Comaroff.
The letter was signed by some of Harvard’s most prominent faculty, including Henry Louis Gates Jr., Jamaica Kincaid, Jill Lepore, and Paul E. Farmer.
The letter described Comaroff as “an excellent colleague, advisor and committed university citizen.”
“We are dismayed by Harvard’s sanctions against him and concerned about its effects on our ability to advise our own students,” the letter said.
The open letter sparked furor on campus. More than 70 other faculty members published a response in The Crimson condemning its message, and graduate students took to social media in outrage.
In a striking reversal, nearly all the faculty members who signed onto the original letter retracted their support for the message after the lawsuit was filed on Tuesday. They wrote in a retraction letter that they “failed to appreciate the impact” the letter would have on students.
“Our concerns were transparency, process and university procedures, which go beyond the merits of any individual case,” the retraction letter said. “We failed to appreciate the impact that this would have on our students, and we were lacking full information about the case. We are committed to all students experiencing Harvard as a safe and equitable institution for teaching and learning.”
The suit on Tuesday alleged that Harvard’s failure to act against Comaroff is part of a broader problem of unchecked gender-based harassment.
“Harvard’s continued failure to act on repeated reports of harassment against Professor Comaroff—until spurred to do so by the media—demonstrates an institutional policy of indifference: a system designed to protect the University, its reputation, and the faculty who sustain that reputation at the expense of its students,” the lawsuit said.
It alleged that faculty administrators at the school knew of past harassment complaints against Comaroff when it hired him from the University of Chicago in 2012.
The suit was filed just over one year after an external review first commissioned in 2019 found a “permissive culture regarding sexual harassment” at the school that allowed a star Government professor to harass female students and colleagues over a span of four decades without penalty.
Harvard’s Title IX coordinator, Nicole M. Merhill, wrote in a statement Wednesday that the lawsuit misrepresented its investigatory processes.
“Representations that do not describe fairly or accurately the University’s processes with regard to obtaining and maintaining material during an investigatory process are extremely troubling to me because they may have a potential chilling effect on our community members’ confidence in the investigatory process and their ability to access counseling and other resources,” she wrote.
A demonstration in support of the three plaintiffs — Czerwienski, Kilburn, and Mandava — is planned for Monday afternoon on Harvard’s Science Center Plaza.

When I — a jaded Harvard pre-med, already in the second semester of my junior year — arrived at the MCAT testing center on Friday, Jan. 21 at 7:34:26 a.m., I observed an array of distraught students waiting expectantly in the check-in room. Quickly, I grabbed my silly little number card and the silly little sheet of AAMC testing rules before joining the crowd and putting on my most distraught face. When my name was finally called, I had already sealed my phone in the silly little plastic bag where it would live for the entire test. Next, the administrator took my picture. This, of course, was for obvious security reasons. What if my identical twin tried to take the exam for me?! Serious threat to potential doctors everywhere! Luckily, I don’t have a twin, so I decided not to worry that she was going to impersonate me and shoved all my personal items into a cute mini locker.
Now, it was time for my pat-down! To be fair, I was wearing a semi-baggy sweat suit, in which I probably could have fit my entire collection of one thousand-page MCAT prep books, but, fortunately, the test center staff investigated my person and proved that I had no book collection in my shirt, no pocket MCAT dictionary in my pockets, no items in my socks, and nothing up my sleeves. I didn’t have anything anywhere, not even in my brain! I’m a test-day angel, I know. To be fair, I paid $320 for this, so I really wanted to enjoy my experience. I got my palms scanned, walked to the testing room, got patted down again, scanned my palms again, AND THEN IT WAS TIME! I sat down in my little cubicle that was audio- and video-recorded (thank god, who knows what kind of hooligans could be trying to get in on this valuable, once-in-a-lifetime experience).
Sadly, I can’t speak of anything that happened from this point forward because of something called jail. Let me explain. If you write about your MCAT on the internet, obviously, no brainer: jail. If you tell all your pre-med friends about your MCAT, so they can study more effectively: jail. Tell your mom who has no relation to anyone else who will ever take the MCAT about the MCAT? Also jail. Think about your MCAT? Yes, that’s still jail. If you don’t believe me, please check the test-taking guidelines. I’d say we have the best test takers in the world because of jail.
Anyway, fast forward seven hours, I went home and cried. Not because I felt particularly defeated by the test, but because I had the most excruciating computer-induced headache and was unable to function as a normal human. As a Harvard pre-med, my ego could not take being questioned by this test, so maybe that was the real reason I cried, but we’ll never know.
At the time, my mind had been reduced to Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems, Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (otherwise known as CARS), Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems, and Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior. What was my best friend’s name? Couldn't tell you. How old was I when I was born? Idk. Could I recite the Krebs cycle in under 37 seconds? Yes. Was anything in any of these four sections relevant to anything I’ll ever do again in my life? I’d like to say no, but in the spirit of scientific inquiry, I will say perhaps. Who knows, what if I have to take the MCAT again? Then every single thing I may or may not have seen (remember, jail) will definitely be extremely useful.
It’s been about fifteen days now. I’m not going to lie, it’s been really hard. I’m still recovering everyday, but I know when scores come out on Tuesday, Feb. 22 at some undisclosed time, it will either be the best or worst day out of a lot of days! I thought the agonizing stress would end when I put my Anki cards away, but here I am, still writing articles that will likely get me scolded by OCS (again) just for the cathartic effect of airing my grievances. If anyone would like an update on my LS2 friend’s journey (described in “The MCAT has Ruined my Life and the Lives of Millions of Others”), she’s working really hard for her March test date. Send us all your good vibes. XOXO, MCAT girl.
