After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alexander Hamilton is the founder of the New York Post and the Coast Guard, the author of 51 of the essays in the Federalist Papers, and most recently, a Broadway star. Even if you’re not big on musicals, you’ve probably heard about the musical “Hamilton.” And whether you’ve seen the show, listened to the music, or just sat confused while your Broadway-obsessed roommate talked about it for 20 minutes, the PBS Great Performances special “Hamilton’s America” is worth your time.
Over the course of slightly less than an hour and a half, “Hamilton’s America” takes viewers on a behind-the-scenes tour of the writing of the Broadway hit. Scenes where historians explain the intricacies of the history behind the show are interspersed with interviews with a slightly younger Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show’s writer and star. The documentary focuses initially on his writing process, starting two years before the show’s Broadway premiere. A harried Miranda has just moved into a new apartment with his wife and is working on preparing his show for Broadway, and the audience comes along with him for the ride. We learn the inception of various songs, how he wrote them, where he wrote them, and the inspiration behind them. Some of the most engaging parts of this section come when the Miranda of the past is still drafting his lyrics, atonally rapping an unfinished line or two; the uncertainty of his past is contrasted with a following shot of the lyrics as they appear in the finished show, and there’s a great sense of artistic progression, an “Oh, that’s how he thought of that” that comes from seeing the vulnerable roughness that came before the polish.
The documentary maintains its focus on Miranda’s process as a motif throughout the piece but intersperses those longer interviews with short quips from prominent modern figures—among them “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush—as well as members of the cast on their specific roles.
This is where a lot of the soul in the documentary comes in. Christopher Jackson, the actor who plays George Washington in the musical, visits Mount Vernon and spends a tense scene in the slave quarters at Washington’s estate. Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton) and Leslie Odom Jr. (Aaron Burr) handle real dueling pistols and read the letters exchanged between their characters more than 230 years ago. Renee Elise Goldsberry (Angelica Schuyler) and Phillipa Soo (Eliza Schuyler) discuss their characters’ complex relationships with the historical Hamilton. These are the moments that offer a glimpse into not the cold hard truths behind the show but the human elements: Why these people chose these roles and what they bring to it.
That said, there’s a lot of music in the documentary too. Never-before-seen recordings of the Broadway performance are interspersed throughout the feature, along with commentary from prominent musicians and actors on the unique style of the show. Daveed Diggs (the Marquis de Lafayette, Thomas Jefferson) and prominent musicians Black Thought (Tariq Trotter) and Questlove (Ahmir Thompson)—both founders of the band “The Roots,” which is currently the stage band for Jimmy Fallon’s “The Tonight Show”—comment on the show’s unique musical style and offer insight into just how different the rap, hip hop, and R&B of the musical are from other shows.
“Hamilton’s America” is worth seeing if you’re not a fan of “Hamilton,” even if just to understand its appeal. If you’re a fan of the show, though, it’s a must-watch. Fall in love with “Hamilton” all over again, and learn about what makes the whole thing tick.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the acclaim her sculptures receive for their sociopolitical implications, Doris Salcedo identifies solely as a maker of art. “I am an artist,” she said at the press preview of her new exhibition at the Harvard Art Museums. “I am not a political activist; I am not in social justice. I am an artist: That’s all I am and all I want to do.” As an observer of the political turmoil and oppression in her home country, Colombia, she feels that she could only offer her empathy as consolation. Her art is thus for an unnamed and unseen audience: the victims of the tragedies. “Whose experience am I honoring?” she said. “The dialogue starts there.” But rather than showing the victims directly, her works are removed from the violence and instead use everyday objects that represent the places of mourning and pain. Hence the title of her exhibition, “The Materiality of Mourning,” which is currently on display at the Harvard Art Museums.
The exhibition features four installations that highlight her work since 2001, beginning with large wooden tables filled with cement. Here she capitalizes on the unsettling feeling of an invaded home: The jarring and deliberate juxtaposition of warmth of the wood and cold density of the cement suggest that something slightly awry and deeply disturbing has occurred. This unlikely combination of materials also puts her technical achievements on full display, which are made possible by close collaboration with engineers and architects. “She sets out to achieve the impossible—and she does it every time,” said Narayan Khandekar, the Director of the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies. To Salcedo, the difficulties of constructing her works are essential to express the complexities of the victims’ experiences that outsiders can never fully understand.
The installations that follow display a collection of steel chairs that mimic Colombian furniture, a skin-like sheet of rose petals, and ghosty silk threads woven with nickel pieces. The steel chairs, like the wooden tables, suggest the opposite of balance, logic, and comfort: The metal uncharacteristically crumples under the weight of an absent being, and despite the seeming stability of the chairs, some of their legs are missing. This strangeness highlights the irreversible damage that violence has on households. Mary Schneider Enriquez, Harvard Art Museum’s Houghton Associate Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, said, quoting Salcedo herself, “All that is normal is forever strange.”
According to Enriquez, strenuous planning has gone into the making and exhibiting of the four pieces. Each handmade gesture of mourning was done with meticulous intention, from the low-hanging lights, the placement of crinkles in the sheet of petals, to the configuration of the gallery spaces themselves. Salcedo’s efforts all aim at fully honoring the experiences of the dead. She mentions in each step of her art making process, she directs herself to the aftermath of trauma in order to resonate with the pain and mourning that provides the foundation for her sculptures and installations. The layouts of her installations were perfected over the course of eight days, and she treated every moment as an act of mourning that needed to be felt alone.
When Salcedo spoke to a crowd prior to her exhibition’s opening, her demeanor matched the gravity she continuously brings to her work. Dressed in all black with perfectly styled curls atop her composed disposition, she expressed a conviction in her work that rooted her to Colombia despite its broken history and corrupt government. At the mention of the country’s recent referendum, she wiped away tears. “All my life I have been in mourning because of political problems,” she said, “The possibility of having a better country is gone.” Given the dire situations, she hopes that she could be one voice of Colombia, together with many others.
“Art should be articulated by the experiences of others. So my art is for them,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SHANGHAI, China—Stanford forward Reid Travis had not played a game since December 15 of last year, but the junior made up for lost time by leading the Cardinal to an 80-70 victory over Harvard in the second annual Pac-12 China Game. Before a crowd of 7,196 that included Yao Ming, Bill Walton, Jason Collins, and Jimmer Fredette, Travis stole the show, leading all players with 24 points and 17 rebounds in what was the regular season opener for both teams as the Cardinal claimed a 80-70 victory over the Crimson.
“I could barely sleep last night,” Travis said. “It’s been a long process, a long summer, a long preseason just staying healthy and getting healthy again. It’s just a blessing to be able to do what I love again and it’s great that we could cap it off with a win.”
After allowing two easy buckets to Stanford inside to begin the game, the Crimson made it a priority to deny Stanford’s big men the ball. As shots by guards from both teams struggled to find the bottom of the net in the game’s opening minutes, Harvard freshman forward Chris Lewis brought the Shanghai crowd to its feet with two blocks on one possession before converting a layup on the offensive end.
The Crimson’s prevent half-court defense worked for most of the first half as the Cardinal went only 9-for-25 from the field and had 18 of its 30 points before intermission come via the fast break or the charity stripe. For the game, Haase’s team went 29-of-43 from the free-throw line.
“Harvard does a great job of denying passes, applying pressure, making it difficult to get entries on offense, and we did struggle with that, especially in the first half,” Stanford coach Jerod Haase said. “We handled it a little bit better in the second half, got more assists in the second half, got the ball inside more in the second half, and that proved to be a big difference.”
Stanford for its part came out in zone defense and forced Harvard’s backline into long jumpers. Senior center Zena Edosomwan struggled to pass out of double teams and finished with just three points in eight minutes.
The Crimson’s relied on unlikely zone busters on Saturday. Freshman forward Henry Welsh found holes in the Cardinal defense in the first half, registering seven points before the break while classmate Bryce Aiken carried the torch in the second. The silky point guard had Stanford counterpart Robert Cartwright on a string at times, penetrating the defense and drawing contact in the lane or connecting on long jumpers. Aiken had 15 second half points, including eight free throws and a three-pointer.
Welsh and Aiken were not the only first-years to get in on the action. In addition to his two blocks, Lewis recorded four points and two rebounds in 10 minutes. Seth Towns and Christian Juzang struggled to find their rhythms on the offensive end but played 14 minutes apiece, with Towns occasionally playing as an undersized power forward in an attempt to remedy a struggling offense. Harvard went just 4-of-17 from long range on the afternoon and shot 37 percent from the field.
The fact that it was the season opener for both teams was apparent in the first half. The clubs combined for 27 fouls, with both squads being in the bonus with 9:47 still to play before intermission. Stanford’s biggest first half lead was seven, but the Crimson cut it to two when co-captain Siyani Chambers hit two free throws with three ticks remaining in the opening frame.
Halftime, which was marked by a performance from jump ropers and a Chinese rendition of Marco Polo featuring a fan and the Alibaba Group’s mascot, may have been the worst thing that happened to Harvard and its momentum. The frontcourt experiment of Edosomwan and junior Chris Egi proved fruitless for a second time and the Cardinal lead ballooned to nine before the half’s first media timeout.
After only scoring five points in the contests first 20 minutes, Travis collected eight in a 200-second span after the break. As Travis and his bulky 245-pound frame began attracting double teams, Stanford began utilizing backdoor cuts and open jumpers to keep Harvard at arm’s length.
“He’s a great player,” Lewis said of Travis. “He really knows how to use his body and is very physical. I think that’s one of the best points of his game. That really hurt me…and I’m just going to try to learn from it.”
Junior forward Michael Humphrey was the yin to Travis’ yang in the second half. The Phoenix native stretched the Crimson defense, converting jumpers in the lane and easy looks inside.
Harvard shot better down the stretch but could not string together enough stops to dig itself out of the hole. A Chambers layup with 3:57 to play cut the deficit to six, but it was the closest the Crimson would get.
“We couldn’t keep them off the foul line and we were just not as disciplined as we need to be for stretches,” Harvard coach Amaker said. “At times we kind of put ourselves in a position where we couldn’t allow ourselves to get on any kind of run because we couldn’t play without fouling.”
Travis and Humphrey allowed the Cardinal to only need one three-pointer on the afternoon to pull out the victory. All told, the 40 points in the paint, 29 free throw makes, and 14 fast break points from the game’s home team proved too much for the Crimson to overcome.
With the result no longer in question, the Harvard bench collectively held its breath when Chambers hit the deck hard going up for a layup in the game’s final minute. Guards Aiken and Corey Johnson had been slow to get up earlier in the afternoon following hard fouls in what was a very physical contest. Chambers, the quarterback for the Crimson on both ends of the floor, was a bright spot for Harvard on Saturday.
He finished with 12 points and four assists over 28 minutes in his first meaningful game action in nearly 20 months. Chambers missed all of last season with a torn ACL and remained on the hardwood following the fall. After trainers and Amaker came over, the senior clutched his knee but was able to walk off the court on his own power.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This was not your typical Harvard basketball game.
It was a day of new faces as the Crimson took on Stanford in Shanghai—new players in Harvard’s top-10 recruiting class, new starters from the newest group of upperclassmen, and new fans as Harvard and the Pac-12 seek to expand the strength and quality of university sports in China.
While there were flashes of positive notes in those new faces, Harvard (0-1) ultimately fell to the Cardinal (1-0), 70-80, with Stanford coach Jerod Haase earning his first victory with the program.
FOCUS ON FRESHMEN
Harvard’s freshman class has been a topic of conversation since last year when it was ranked in ESPN’s top-10 recruiting classes, but few knew exactly how the pieces would fit in with the team in their first year. Saturday’s game against Stanford proved that though there are some bumps to smooth out, the future is bright for this group.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker showed his confidence in the group by first putting forward Seth Towns in the starting lineup. It wasn’t long until several of Towns’ classmates followed, with Amaker giving guards Bryce Aiken and Christian Juzang and forwards Chris Lewis and Henry Welsh substantial minutes.
“I do like the potential of our young kids,” Amaker said. “This is their first opportunity to play a college game and I thought they did a tremendous job given who we are playing and all the other things that come with this travel and this trip.”
During its two exhibition games—first against MIT in Cambridge followed by a contest earlier this week against Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai—the freshmen played substantial minutes, but many speculated it was a chance to get their feet wet before the regular season began. Saturday showed, however, that Amaker plans to throw them into the fire early and often to show why they earned the reputations that they did.
Overall, the group didn’t disappoint. The five freshmen who made it onto the floor contributed over 60 percent of the team’s minutes, 70 percent of the team’s points, and 50 percent of the team’s rebounds. Aiken, who had 21 points, led the group.
Lewis and Welsh’s strong performances were perhaps the most surprising due to the veteran depth at the forward position. Senior Zena Edosomwan was the team’s leader in scoring and rebounds last year, and junior Chris Egi is a new addition to the starting rotation. Both Lewis and Welsh, however, saw more playing time than Edosomwan and Egi. The pair was also tasked with guarding Stanford’s top player, junior forward Reid Travis.
“I was very impressed,” Travis said of the duo. “Of course Welsh, he picks and pops a lot, he had a good looking jump shot and he had some good moves in the posts, some up and unders, and he finished well around the rim. Lewis, he’s just a beast, he was just running around, he got a few dunks, he was just blocking everything that was around him.”
M-AIKEN MOVES AND SIY-ING SUCCESS
Coming into the season, many projected that Aiken would come off the bench when Amaker rested senior co-captain Siyani Chambers at the point guard position. That was not the case on Saturday, as the pair played most of their minutes on the floor at the same time.
After the Shanghai Jiao Tong Exhibition, Chambers described their dynamic as effective because of their differing styles of play.
“Bryce is very aggressive and that’s what we need,” Chambers said on Wednesday. “He’s a very aggressive, look to score type guard and I’m more of a try to drive and dish, so we have a good balance going on with both of us.”
Aiken swung the momentum back in Harvard’s direction after hitting a three—the first of the game for either team—with 4:27 remaining in the first half. Prior to the shot, Harvard had fallen into its deepest hole of the game down 23-17, but Aiken’s shot put the game back within one possession, exciting the fans in Mercedes-Benz Arena.
Similarly, Chambers scored under duress when plays collapsed. While his first instinct was to pass—which resulted in a team-high four assists—the senior finished the night with 12 points, which was second only to Aiken.
Chambers and Aiken’s consistency will be key as Amaker toys with the wing position. While Towns started at the three spot, the Columbus, Ohio native got into foul trouble and struggled to find his shot, as he sunk only 3-of-8 from the floor. Sophomore Corey Johnson also filled in at the wing when playing with Chambers and Aiken, but was not his typical three-point-machine self, finishing the day without scoring a point.
WE’RE NOT IN LAVIETES ANYMORE
Compared to other major basketball universities, Harvard basketball home games are typically lacking in pomp and circumstance. There are no loud hype videos, the gym is filled with bleachers rather than seats, and a typical halftime contest usually involves young children racing to dress up in a basketball uniform and sink a layup. 
This was not the case at Mercedes-Benz Arena on Saturday afternoon. The 18,000-seat facility, though not packed, had several thousand fans in attendance—including significant crowds of Stanford and Harvard alumni from China and the U.S.
In addition to the local fans and university affiliates, several former professional basketball players were in attendance for the game. Bill Walton, a staff member of the Pac-12, called the game for the ESPN broadcast. Former Houston Rockets Center Yao Ming was in attendance as the Pac-12 donated $10,000 to his youth foundation. Stanford alum Jason Collins—who became the first openly gay professional athlete in any of the four major North American sports leagues in 2013— travelled with the Cardinal throughout the week. Additionally, Harvard alum Jeremy Lin and Brooklyn Nets teammate Brook Lopez of Stanford sent their well wishes to their respective teams as well via video broadcast from New York.
While many of the fans did not align specifically with either the Crimson or the Cardinal, there were loud cheers from the audience anytime a player sunk a three-pointer or slammed a dunk home. Travis was arguably the most popular player as he had several dunks, including one in which he hung with his arm through the rim for several seconds, eliciting the loudest cheers of the day.
“[Being in China has] been an amazing experience for us all the way around,” Amaker said. “Obviously wish we could have come out on the right side of the ledger here in terms of the ‘W’ here this afternoon, but all in all for us to have the opportunity to bring our ball club here, to experience this amazing country and two different cities and just learning about the rich history and tradition here…we’re very lucky.”
