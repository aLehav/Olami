Mila Kunis, riding in a black car with the Hasty Pudding Theatricals president Amira T. Weeks ’18 and cast vice president Jacques Berguig '18 by her side, paraded down Massachusetts Avenue as Hasty Pudding's 2018 Woman of the Year Thursday.
Weeks prefaced Kunis's roast by announcing the group's decision to accept women as cast members, breaking with almost 200 years of precedent. But the roast had more light-hearted moments, too: Kunis threw donuts, performed a dance-off, and inhaled helium from a "Minions" balloon before reenacting a Jim Beam commercial.
After about 20 minutes of roasting, the Hasty Pudding presented Kunis with the "Pudding Pot," an award presented to entertainers who have made lasting impacts in the industry.
The Boston Circus Guild joined the festivities, walking on stilts and spinning hula hoops. They trailed behind the Bentley Continental, sporting pastel hair and wide smiles.
Some students who attended the event carried signs that protested the Hasty Pudding Theatricals's former policy preventing women from joining the cast.
Someone threw a teddy bear into the parade, and it missed the car by ten feet. The football players flanking Kunis gave a collective thumbs down.
Hasty Pudding actors Scott Kall '20 and Daniel E. Hughes '18 watched as Mila Kunis and the rest of the parade approached Farkas Hall and prepared for the kickline.
Before beginning Kunis's roast, Weeks read aloud a letter from former Pudding president Andrew L. Farkas '82. “With no further fanfare, the graduate board of the Hasty Pudding Institute has determined that commencing with the 2019 Hasty Pudding Show, the Hasty Pudding welcomes women to audition,” she said.
The Hasty Pudding challenged Kunis to throw Dunkin' Donuts at Peter Griffin, a "Family Guy" character played by Hughes, in order to receive her "Pudding Pot."
"Oh my God, this has been such a fun day so far. It's great. If you look at the list of women who have been honored, it's an incredible list to be a part of. I signed the wall and I signed it next to Helen Mirren," Kunis said at the press conference. "I was like, 'Yeah! Fuck yeah.' It was great."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mila Kunis, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 2018 Woman of the Year, is a versatile actor. She played the lively Jackie in the television series  “That ’70s Show,” voiced the lovingly awkward Meg Griffin on the classic sitcom “Family Guy,” and was the antagonist of the psychological horror film “Black Swan.” That adaptability played out in real life at the Woman of the Year festivities, as she weighed in on a range of heavy conversations during a day of lighthearted celebrations. During the press conference, Kunis reflected on her experiences being a part of an immigrant family.
“Your family ultimately never moves for themselves. They always move for their kids. I find that to be true for probably myself …. ” Kunis said. “You don’t want to fail your family, and I think that’s amplified when you’re an immigrant.”
Kunis’s family immigrated from Ukraine when she was seven. According to her interview with The Telegraph, they only had $250, and Kunis spoke no English. She signed up for an acting class when she was nine, with her mother’s support, and landed a role in a Barbie commercial.
“You always want to better the world, because your family bettered it, or tried to, for you.” Kunis paused slightly, reflecting, and said, “I don’t know, it’s such a weird thing to answer considering today’s time.”
Despite the gravity of the day’s themes, Kunis was all smiles at the parade in Cambridge, waving from a car with cast members of the Pudding Theatricals. At the celebratory roast, Kunis playfully pushed a donut into a Pudding cast members’ face in order to get her “Pudding Pot” as the Woman of the Year award. Heavy topics and big announcements aside, Kunis can have some fun, too.
Later that day, Kunis kept her cool amid the backlash of accepting an award from the traditionally all-male casted theatre troupe. Before she was awarded her “Pudding Pot” on Thursday, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals President Amira T. Weeks ’18 made a historic announcement to allow women into their cast. Kunis stated her strong support for the policy change at the press conference following the roast celebration. “I wouldn’t be here otherwise,” she said.
Kunis went on to say that lasting change against sexism in the workplace is happening, pointing to the tradition that the Pudding is breaking.
“Putting women higher in the workplace will change the world—it has been statistically proven,” she said. “And as long as we keep that moving forward, as our number one position, then everything will happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like Oedipus with Jocasta, or Donald Trump with the GOP, Harvard students have a complicated relationship with privilege.
We rail against privilege as a heinous byproduct of oppressive social structures, bemoan the social stratification it creates, argue (somewhat paradoxically) for its popularization as a universal right, and try to justify it through wise spending on artisan coffee. And of course, while making these perceptive observations, we’re all standing on—dare we say depending on—the pulpit of privilege that comes with a Harvard education.
Less often acknowledged, though, is the uncomfortable feeling that slides through every student’s gut when someone brings up the p-word. It’s some slimy sludge of resentment, dis-ease, insecurity, and guilt—a potion straight from the steaming cauldron of undergraduate discourse.
This queasiness isn’t about the unequal distribution of wealth, the social power of WASPs and other modern deplorables, or even racism, sexism, cissexism, ableism, or any other “ism” coined thirty seconds ago that will send you running for Urban Dictionary. It’s more to do with Harvard students’ disposition toward our own opportunities. It’s about our attitude toward our aptitude (or lack thereof), as demonstrated by our enrollment in this university.
We don’t want to admit it, but we’re scared of privilege.
There are two main reasons why this is the case. First, college admissions are founded on the myth of meritocracy. We like to believe that we’re the chosen 5.2% because we deserve to be here. Because we outmatched 94.8% of the 34,511 other applicants with our intelligence, leadership, diligence, well-roundedness, and A plus (or A minus) level of hard-earned accomplishment. The thought that all our Harvard-worthy merit boils down to circumstances out of our control—who our parents are, where we live, what color skin we have—throws that sense of worth out the window. If we got in simply because of our “privilege,” we don’t just feel cheated. We feel invalidated.
Second, once we start to question if we really are the reason for our success, we start to feel guilty about the opportunities we have. Why should we have been born in the socioeconomic stratum that gets us through Johnston Gate, and not in some shanty a world away from Massachusetts Avenue? Why should we have fast-tracks to Wall Street, Washington, or Silicon Valley when our peers—no less talented, but simply less fortunate—struggle to make ends meet? If we’re really just thrown into the world, what claim do we have to anything? Geworfenheit wrecks our sense of self-worth. So we cringe, guilt-ridden and insecure, at our poisonous privilege.
This attitude isn’t productive for anyone. No one rejected from Harvard feels consoled by our muddled remorse, and no one accepted to Harvard takes best advantage of her opportunities by second-guessing themselves at every step. But the way out isn’t simply telling ourselves that we’re the only reason we’re here. All of us, even the “self-made” individuals who have overcome the odds with extraordinary drive and resilience, are products of circumstances out of our control—the people we’ve met, the situations we’ve encountered, the talents, personalities, and dispositions we were born into. Instead, the solution is to take a different perspective on privilege.
The Parable of the Talents, one of Jesus’ most famous teachings in the Bible’s New Testament, offers some insight. According to the story, a man leaves for a long journey and entrusts his property to three servants: He gives ten talents—the equivalent of about 20 years of a day laborer’s wages—to the first servant, five talents to the second, and one talent to the third. The first and second servants invest the money to earn back twice what their master gave them; the third buries his talent in the ground for safekeeping. When the owner returns, he rewards the “good and faithful” servants who have made the most of their opportunities, and he punishes the third for his failure to do likewise.
The story offers two key insights into the Harvard student’s privileged quandary. First: instead of feeling inadequate or guilty about not completely earning all that we’ve achieved, we should embrace the idea that fundamentally, we’ve been given all that we have. Who, after all, can genuinely take full credit for their talents?
Second, we should think of privilege not as a one-off leg-up to kickstart a life of luxury, but as an opportunity—and one step further, as a responsibility. Like the servant with ten talents, we should view the incredible opportunities afforded by our education not as something to feel guilty about, but as something to combine with discipline, imagination, and perseverance to give back in proportion with what we’ve been given. And since we didn’t earn any of these privileges by ourselves, don’t we have the duty to use them for something greater than ourselves? Seen in this light, talents and gifts are actually burdens—wonderful, but weighty. Privilege is power, and to borrow from Spiderman, “With great power comes great responsibility.”
We shouldn’t panic or groan under this burden, but neither should we take our privilege lightly. We should see our vast opportunities as a commission for vast achievement—not strictly for ourselves, but for those around us—to reach beyond the limits we would have faced without those opportunities. Privilege isn’t an invitation, but a responsibility to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 27, 2018, at 4:49 p.m.
Photographer Nan Goldin, whose work is displayed in the Harvard Art Museums, has recently called upon the University to refuse donations from the Sackler family. The Sackler name is associated with a pharmaceutical dynasty closely linked to Purdue Pharma, which developed and manufactured OxyContin, the opioid drug with which Goldin long struggled with addiction.
Goldin is certainly not alone in her struggle. Some consider OxyContin (in large part as a result of Purdue Pharma’s misleading marketing of the drug) to be a primary contributing factor to the opioid epidemic, which on average claims 115 lives daily and ravages the nation with crippling addiction. Now, after publicizing the hashtag #ShameOnSackler and organizing her advocacy group Prescription Advocacy Intervention Now, Goldin is urging institutions like Harvard to cut ties with the family.
Harvard should carefully consider whether it should disavow the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation, whose namesake donated to create the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. The University must acknowledge the moral and financial quandaries that come with accepting money from a foundation accused of links to OxyContin. Purdue Pharma, which manufactures OxyContin and whose board features eight members of the Sackler family, has been sued time and time over for misleading the public, physicians, and regulators about the addictive effect of OxyContin. The company and three past executives pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2007.
Given the complex relationship the foundation holds with Purdue Pharma, however, we believe historical clarity is necessary before coming to a firm decision about the foundation’s moral culpability and whether or not Harvard should accept its funds. Family politics, especially when it comes to industry giants, are complicated. The Sacklers are not a monolithic unit, and they are divided in their support of and degree of connection to Purdue Pharma. Elizabeth A. Sackler, who runs the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation, has condemned Purdue Pharma’s practices. She has further stated that her father, Arthur, and his descendants have not benefited financially from the sale of OxyContin.
She is correct that she and Arthur M. Sackler have not been direct financial beneficiaries from OxyContin. Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler bought Purdue Pharma, then Purdue Frederick Pharma, in 1952. While Mortimer and Raymond operated as joint CEOs, Arthur acted as a more passive board member. He died before the company released OxyContin, and his descendants sold their shares to the other two brothers.
But that does not necessarily absolve Arthur M. Sackler and his descendants of moral responsibility for the systems of power, information, and norms that enabled OxyContin’s rise. Arthur M. Sackler revolutionized the way drugs are marketed, directing campaigns not only toward patients but towards doctors. His marketing of the tranquilizers Librium and Valium not only provided much of his wealth, but also set a standard for marketing campaigns that encouraged liberal prescribing practices with little regard to the addictive potential of drugs. He also co-founded the company I.M.S., which Purdue Pharma contracted to collect data on doctors’ prescribing practices. I.M.S. data not only allowed Purdue to track the effectiveness of their marketing but made them aware of the "pill mills" doctors were running out of their offices.
None of this information makes a clear cut case that Harvard should cut ties with the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation. Arguably, it does not even morally condemn Sackler himself. Rather, it signifies that Harvard’s relationship with this foundation requires further investigation. Above all, this conversation must be guided by a thorough investigation into the complex dynamics of the Sackler family—its finances, ethics, and societal influence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some American high school English teachers today asperse the name of Charles Dickens, calling his works outdated and unrelatable.
We can see evidence of this disenchantment reflected in the new sets of curricula created and adopted by schools across the country.
Take Massachusetts, for instance. According to the Pioneer Institute, Massachusetts had been the leader in reading scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress—“the nation’s report card”—since 2005. These high scores had long been attributed to the state’s remarkably strong focus on classic literature in schools; even so, when Massachusetts adopted new Common Core standards in 2012, they reduced the amount of classic literature—including the works of Dickens—by 60 percent.
Nearly every state has adopted similar Common Core standards, breaking with the tradition of instructors in the British Commonwealth who revere his novels as Classics with a capital ‘C’. However, although appealing to tradition alone is to commit a logical fallacy, traditions are often worth giving special consideration in evaluation. Sometimes, they’re traditions for a good reason.
Dickens, for instance, really does deserve his fame as a writer. Yes, he was a serial author, paid by the word as he released his works bit-by-bit, one month at a time, and, yes, he relied upon the common people to circulate and read his works in order to remain profitable. His works, as a result, are frequently attacked as being wordy and sensational, but this is a terribly arrogant and myopic view to espouse.
A careful and deliberate man by nature, Dickens was respected for paying attention to every word he wrote. His winding style and enthusiasm for his work resulted in language that was, at times, florid and meandering, full of commas and adjectives, but it is all skillfully crafted and settles beautifully into a cohesive whole.
His diction is varied and versatile, adapting masterfully to the needs of dialogue and description, vulgarism and sophistication; the phrases he uses are injected with a charming local color, turning things like shops and streets into vivid and pointed descriptors. In fact, it was not unheard of for Dickens to write multiple alternative pieces, selecting only one for publication (as he did, at his publisher’s behest, for the denouement to “Great Expectations”).
Dickens, then, was popular because his works were moving and vibrant. It was not for sheer crass pleasure that crowds lined the piers of New York in 1841 as a trans-Atlantic liner arrived from England: the people, some sobbing, were shouting to hear news of Little Nell, a beloved character from “The Old Curiosity Shop,” who was revealed in previous installments of the novel to be on the verge of death.
And this isn’t surprising: Dickens’s works are infused with a breathtakingly vast and rich background, drawing deeply from his experiences, travels and readings. They are at once history and philosophy, fairytale and politics. As a child, Dickens’s mother was severe by necessity, and his family, on account of his insolvent father, spent much time in debtors’ prisons. He could not pursue his education at leisure as he desired—something we today take for granted—and instead was forced to labor for life-sustaining income from a very young age.
He suffered many heartbreaks and tragedies, including personal losses of loved ones, and spent a great deal of time acquainting himself with the hardships and travails of others. Scenes of the French countryside, of unrequited love, of regret, of the British legal system, of child labor, of courthouses and criminal justice, of factories and the plight of the working class—all these were things that Dickens himself was or became an expert in before penning.
Dickens’s works are at once thoughtful and thought-provoking; incisive and heartwarming; teaching and beseeching. They are a joint effort between author and reader, each an attempt not only to entertain but also to inform or inspire a kinder, softer, better world. Flitting from embedded joke to embedded joke, theme to theme, subtle motif to shocking truth, Dickens’s writings are akin to a finely woven fabric: they are works of creativity, elegance, and beauty, but most of all they aim to be unified and useful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 25, 2018 at 8:48 p.m.
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals group will allow women to join its cast after the next round of auditions in fall 2018, breaking with almost 200 years of precedent, the organization’s president announced Thursday.
Pudding President Amira T. Weeks ’18 debuted the group’s new policy during the annual Woman of the Year celebratory roast, this year honoring actress Mila Kunis. Weeks read aloud a letter from Andrew L. Farkas ’82, the former president of the Pudding, to a crowd assembled in Farkas Hall.
“With no further fanfare, the graduate board of the Hasty Pudding Institute has determined that, commencing with the 2019 Hasty Pudding Show, the Hasty Pudding welcomes women to audition and perform in the roles in the show, and be given equal opportunity to play those roles based on the quality of their individual talents,” Weeks read from the letter.
The room of roughly 200 people immediately erupted in cheers. Attendees gave Weeks a standing ovation.
 The Pudding, founded in 1844, has had an all-male cast of performers since its inception, though women hold positions on the group’s business, tech, and design boards. The Pudding has allowed women to audition before—Harvard women have sought to join the cast three times over the past three years. Each time, though, female auditioners failed to earn a callback.
Kunis, speaking at a press conference after the roast, said her decision to attend the day’s celebrations was contingent on the Pudding’s choice to go co-ed.
“I’m here,” she said. “I wouldn’t be here otherwise.”
Kunis said she knew before accepting the award that the Pudding planned to begin selecting women as cast members. She said this new co-ed policy is “something to me that was very important.”
Kunis added, though, that she did not “stimulate” the Pudding’s decision to go co-ed. She said members of the Pudding have been trying to make this change for a long time.
“This is something that this program has always wanted to do,” she said. “This has nothing to do with me or today, it’s simply something that was going to happen inevitably.”
“I don’t want that to be taken away from the students, the infrastructure—they’ve been fighting for this [and] they’re the reason this happened,” Kunis added.
Some members and alumni of the Pudding have led a charge for co-ed status in recent years. More than 86 individuals signed a Pudding alumni petition in Sept. 2016 calling on the organization to admit women.
Weeks said at the press conference following the roast that the Pudding’s decision to accept women will take the organization forward “as a leader in women’s rights and gender equality.”
“While we have great respect for the art form that has been presented by the Pudding for over a hundred and seventy years, which art form dates back to the ancient Greek times, the world is in a very different place,” Weeks said, still reading from Farkas’s letter.
Op-eds in the Boston Globe and The Crimson previously called on Kunis to reject the Woman of the Year award given the Pudding’s policy of excluding women from its cast. At the press conference Thursday, Kunis criticized the suggestion that she turn down the honor.
She said not showing up would have been a “pretty weak stance” to take.
“The smarter thing... to ask of me would’ve been to take a stance,” Kunis said. “Backing down is not taking a stance.”
Though Thursday marked a moment of significant change for the Pudding, Weeks and Kunis still sought to celebrate the group’s history. Weeks noted that the Pudding—which houses a social club and a capella group as well as its theatrical troupe—was the first social institution at Harvard to go co-ed.
Harvard’s other historically single-gender social groups—particularly its all-male final clubs—have come under fire in the past two years as College and University administrators seek to push the clubs to adopt gender-neutral membership practices. In May 2016, University President Drew G. Faust announced a social group policy penalizing members of single-gender social groups on Harvard’s campus.
Kunis emphasized that, though women have never served as Pudding cast members, they have been active in other aspects of the show.
“The one that thing that people didn’t realize was that there’s twelve performers on stage, but there’s forty eight other people, and they’re putting the whole show together,” Kunis said. “And a lot of them are women. And so, this production has been forward thinking, for many years. For decades.”
Paul Rudd is set to accept the Pudding’s 2018 Man of the Year award with festivities on Feb. 2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 2, 2018 at 4:55 p.m.
Princeton political science professors Christina Davis '93 and Kosuke Imai, who earned a Ph.D. in Government from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, will join Harvard’s Government department next year as full professors. Davis will also be appointed the Susan S. and Kenneth L. Wallach Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard.
Davis said she studies “international relations with a focus on international trade, East Asia, and how East Asia engages with trade,” while Imai “develops statistical and machine-learning techniques for analyzing data to answer questions in social sciences.”
Both professors already have Harvard affiliations, and Davis said her “Harvard loyalty” was one reason she decided to return.
They also said Harvard’s larger size and wider resources were reasons to switch universities. Imai said Harvard is “very attractive because it’s a much larger university, and it has professional schools.” He said these schools each have some faculty focused on statistics and machine learning.
“There’s a really big community who share interests with myself,” Imai said.
“Harvard will present new opportunities,” Davis said, “Harvard is a very large university and I look forward to reaching out beyond just political science. The Reischauer Institute will be a great resource for me, as well as the Law School.”
Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild said that Dean of Social Sciences Claudine Gay authorized one new hire for the department in any field.
“[The search committee] started with a list of 140 people who… for some reason or other were clearly prominent, and they worked their way down from 140 to Christina Davis. And we were really smitten with Kosuke Imai, as well.”
The two professors are married and made the decision to move together, choosing Harvard over offers from other universities, including Stanford and Columbia.
Hochschild said that the Government department has shrunk in size recently, making the new hires critical.
“At our peak, now 10 years ago, we had 48 FTEs, full time equivalents…now we have 42,” she said. “We have several very prominent professors who have retired, Professor Bates, Putnam, Dominguez, Alt either all have recently retired or are in the process. And we have a few people who are mid-career who went to another university."
Invigorated by their success with Davis and Imai, Hochschild said the Government department has offered two more positions to another couple who would join the department as junior faculty next year, but has not yet heard back.
Hochschild said the department is also currently running searches “for both senior and junior faculty,” although they don’t yet have authorization to hire next year.
Professors Davis and Imai said they are looking forward to working with students as well as faculty.
“My goal is to show students that the applications of statistics and machine learning to the social sciences can be as fascinating as developing those methods as a computer scientist or statistician,” Imai said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
UPDATED: January 27, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Kosuke Imai as a graduate of Harvard College. In fact, he earned a Ph.D. in Government from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 2003.

After an exuberant parade marked by a surprise announcement, actress Mila Kunis received the annual Woman of the Year Award from Hasty Pudding Theatricals on Thursday afternoon.
Kunis, known for her roles in “Black Swan," “That '70s Show," and “Family Guy," rode down Massachusetts Ave. in a convertible surrounded by vibrantly costumed Pudding members who sang her name and planted kisses on her cheeks. Shortly after Kunis finished parading though the streets, Pudding president Amira T. Weeks ‘18 announced the organization will be casting women for the Pudding’s 171st production in 2019, breaking with almost 200 years of all-male precedent.
Kunis said she would not have attended Thursday's celebration had the Pudding not announced its new gender-neutral policy.
But luckily for the crowds of people who thronged the sidewalks hoping to catch a glimpse of the actress, she did. An elderly man professed his eternal love as Kunis glided past. Several passersby, heading elsewhere, got caught up in the commotion.
“I was actually trying to go back to my dorm,” Aaron C. Viser ‘19 said. “I had no idea what it was, but then saw a bunch of football players—figured it was Mila Kunis.”
The Woman of the Year Award, the Pudding’s oldest accolade, was established in 1951 to honor performers who have made “lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment,” according to the club’s website.
“It’s a quintessential Harvard event,” Audrey E. Pettner ‘21 said.
Despite subzero temperatures, several parade goers said they enjoyed the fanfare. Zachary R. Fraley ‘21 described the parade as “a very jovial event.”
“I loved the band. The band was the best part,” Freddie S. Shanel ‘21 said.
Fraley agreed. “Red trombone guy, I’m gonna hire you for my wedding,” he added.
Kunis too, had her share of fun at the celebration.  Amidst the volley of jokes aimed at the her during the roast following the parade, Kunis inhaled helium, launched donuts at a Peter Griffin impersonator, and had a dance-off with someone clad in a “Black Swan”-inspired tutu.
But some on Thursday did more than watch the festivities. Roughly a dozen students came to protest the event, criticizing the Hasty Pudding’s former policy of barring women actors from its cast.
In recent days, op-eds in several publications including the Boston Globe and The Crimson had called on Kunis to reject the Woman of the Year award given the Pudding’s former policy of excluding women.
The controversy surrounding Thursday’s events comes amid a movement reverberating throughout Hollywood and the media industry that seeks to expose gender imbalances in the workplace.
At a press conference following the roast, Kunis said that, despite the controversy, she was eager to attend and glad she did.
“Backing down is not taking a stance,” she said.  “If you look at a list of women that have been honored, it’s an incredible list to be a part of. I did sign the wall, and I signed next to Helen Mirren and I was like yeah! Fuck yeah!” Kunis said.
Kunis ended the press conference with some parting advice.
“Never stop being creative. Never stop working hard. And always try to create something for someone else," she said.

Several Kennedy School of Government professors and administrators said President Trump’s recent comments about “shithole” countries were not only disappointing but damaging for the future of institutions like the Kennedy School.
During a meeting with lawmakers earlier this month about a bipartisan immigration deal, Trump asked, “Why are we having all of these people from shithole countries come here?” in reference to El Salvador, Haiti, and African countries, according to The Washington Post. He continued by saying the United States should accept more immigrants from places like Norway and Asian countries.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf responded to Trump’s comments in an email sent to Kennedy School affiliates a few days after the story about the controversial remarks broke.
“The term that was reportedly used by the president should not be used by any national leader to describe any other nation,” Elmendorf wrote in the email. “We should all expect better from our public leaders, and I certainly expect better from the president of my country.”
The Kennedy School admits students from 104 different countries, according to school spokesperson Doug Gavel. Forty-seven percent of students and approximately 23 percent of faculty come from outside the U.S.
Professor Matthew A. Baum, who studies global communications, said the rhetoric coming from the White House is damaging to goals the government may want to achieve both domestically and internationally.
“It’s very empowering to people that share his views to verbalize them more aggressively and loudly, which coarsens public discourse and reduces trust and raises misunderstanding, hostility—just basically the opposite of what you would want if the goal is to foster dialogue, communication, understanding, respect and those sorts of things,” Baum said.
Dara Kay Cohen, an associate professor of public policy, conducted research for her first book in Sierra Leone and El Salvador. She is currently researching public opinion, political violence, and gender in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
Cohen said she observed the challenging lifestyles people faced in these countries, citing high infant mortality and outbreaks of disease.
“The people who I met, the sort of ordinary people who lived their lives in those countries, struck me as living their lives with immense amount of dignity and hope and resilience, given the incredible challenges they have faced in all three countries in recent decades,” Cohen said.
Baum said President Trump’s comments make it difficult for the Kennedy School to recruit students, especially those who hail from foreign countries.
“It’s a really tough situation for institutions focused on building or attracting smart talented people to be public leaders because the role of a public leader is being challenged or undermined and it makes recruitment of the best and the brightest more difficult,” Baum said. “The more people are cynical and distrusting and don’t think the government works or don’t think they can rely on the institutions of government, the less likely they are to want to make that their career.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City officials and residents debated the merits of a petition aimed at restricting the size of commercial businesses in Harvard Square in a meeting Wednesday, ultimately failing to reach an official recommendation.
The Cambridge Ordinance Committee met this Wednesday to discuss a petition submitted by Cambridge resident Peter B. Kroon. The petition would add new criteria to the process for reviewing applications for special permits and variances in the Harvard Square Overlay district.
If approved, the petition would amend zoning regulations, requiring buildings of over 60 linear feet or more to devote half of their frontage to “small store space,” defined as spaces under 1,250 rentable feet. The petition also would restrict all floor area above a building height of 60 feet to residential space.
Under the petition, commercial storefronts like banks, trust companies, real estate agencies and other administrative offices would be allowed to occupy no more than 25 feet of business frontage in the Square.
The petitioners, led by Kroon, said they sought to protect small business in the Square, addressing an issue they feel current infrastructure does not sufficiently address.
“Our concern is the retail ecosystem,” Kroon said at the meeting. “And use is something that the Historical Commission does not talk about and will not talk about.”
The Cambridge Historical Commission, which has been thrust into city-wide debates over the future of Harvard Square, has recently faced criticism from some residents for approving a pedestrian mall in the center of the Square in August. In the past few years, new landowners and increasing rents have pushed out many small businesses.
Kroon originally submitted his petition to the Cambridge City Clerk on Sept. 25. The City’s planning commission previously discussed the petition on multiple occasions.
At the meeting, Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, spoke in firm opposition to the petition.
“The type of stores, who owns them, how much frontage they have, what their merchandising policies are, and whether they are 1800 square feet or 1500 square feet is far less important than good quality and good value,” she said.
Jillson argued the petition would hurt business growth and success in the Square.
“Given that this petition does nothing to increase foot traffic and that it hinders sustainable leasing opportunities, diminishes flexibility, restricts growth, and hyperregulates marketing efforts, we strongly object to it,” Jillson said.
Though many members of the committee—including City Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, chair of the ordinance committee and Vice Mayor Jan Devereux—supported the intent of the petition, small debates about around specific points prevented the meeting from moving quickly.
Following five hours of debate, Carlone motioned to “leave it in committee at this point and to pick it up another time.”
Further complicating the proceedings, the petitioners modified the petition prior to the Planning Board’s Jan. 2 meeting, leading to concerns about whether or not the petition had gone through the proper legislative channels.
“There are a lot of great ideas and concepts here,” Carlone said. “I feel strongly about them and maybe the best thing to do is repackage them and do a little more research with property owners.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing by a congested intersection and braving the 21 degree weather, Allstonians held up colorful signs to protest anticipated traffic delays and transportation issues due to construction delays on West Station.
The rally, hosted by People’s Pike, protested the delay of the construction of West Station, a transit station slated to be constructed on Harvard-owned land in Allston, to 2040. Attendees held up signs like “Delaying West Station is Honkers” and “Get West Station Back on Track” during rush-hour traffic at the River Street Bridge intersection. On the “Rally for Transit, Not Traffic” event page on Facebook, the group encouraged attendees to march to the campaign headquarters of Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79.
“Let him know that we need West Station NOW!” the Facebook event page said.
People’s Pike is a group of Bay Staters who find issues with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation’s plans to improve the Mass. Turnpike.
The protests come just one day after Harvard pledged, in a letter to MassDOT Secretary Stephanie Pollack, to increase its funding for West Station to $50 million. Initially, Harvard intended to cover a third of construction costs, but, after Mass. politicians asked the University to fund “almost the entire cost” in a public letter, Harvard increased its pledge.
At a town meeting Monday, Allston residents also raised concerns about vehicle congestion in the decades between now and a completed West Station. Attendees of the rally shared similar worries.
“I feel like the way that the project is currently set up, it is going to primarily benefit people living outside of our neighborhood while lowering the quality of life in the neighborhood,” Allston resident Tony Arias said.
Residents pointed out the negative consequences of the heavy congestion currently commonplace in Allston.
“There are people who don’t even feel like they can back up out of their driveway during rush hour, there are people who are afraid to bicycle on the streets of our neighborhood, there are people who have been killed on the streets of our neighborhood walking and biking,” Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said. “It’s just not okay.”
In response to Harvard’s increased commitment to fund West Station, resident Steve Kaiser said, “This changes the whole game. It basically says to the state and BU, ‘Hey, you guys get off the dime.’”
Other residents said they hoped the University and MassDOT would conduct a transit study to better address traffic congestion.
Residents from surrounding towns also attended the rally in a show of solidarity.
“Traffic not only impacts this [Allston’s] side of the river, but our side of the river as well,” Cambridge resident Catherine Zusy said. “There’s congestion from this side of Memorial Drive between 3:00 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. every day. Down Western Avenue, you can barely move.”
On its website, the People’s Pike recommends residents submit letters encouraging MassDOT to invest in more transportation-related development projects.

While some doctors have professed alarm at a harsh strain of the influenza virus going around in this year’s flu season, which has so far caused at least 30 pediatric deaths across the country, Harvard University Health Services representatives say they have not seen an abnormally high rate of flu among Harvard students.
“Although HUHS has not received indications to-date that Harvard University has experienced an atypical number of flu cases this winter, the number of reported cases in Massachusetts and across the country have begun to increase, as is customary for this time of year,” HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry wrote in a written statement.
Still, Perry noted students should take measures to minimize their risk of contracting a virus.
“We would like to remind students of simple, preventive measures that can help lower your risk of getting sick during flu season,” Perry wrote. “To ensure the health and safety of all, please practice good hand washing, avoid contact with those who are sick, and if you haven’t yet done so, get vaccinated.”
Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said this year’s most predominant influenza strain is H3N2, a strain notorious for aggressive symptoms.
“It was introduced in 1968 and over the years we've had H3N2 or an H1N1, so this isn't brand new,” Fauci said. “When you think about the most aggressive and most difficult of the strains, historically H3N2 is generally a bad actor.”
Pritish K. Tosh, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic, said that though other flu seasons featuring H3N2 have been equally infectious, “this one happens to be more severe. The vaccine does not seem to be as effective.”
HUHS routinely encourages students and staff to get the annual flu shot. They provide the vaccine to Harvard students free of charge during the fall semester in House dining halls and other satellite clinics.
But experts say this year’s vaccine may be less effective than vaccines of years past.
“The vaccine this year has not had great efficacy,” Tosh said. “The vaccine efficacy was close to 10 percent.”
Vanderbilt University Professor William Schaffner, who studies immunization policy and infectious diseases, said the vaccines effectiveness can be compromised because the virus can mutate.
“This is one of the major challenges in trying to prevent these influenza infections and is at the root of why the vaccine has to be reformulated essentially on an annual basis,” Schaffner said.
Schaffner warned that seemingly mild flu symptoms can quickly escalate.
“Influenza, it’s a serious respiratory infection that can take even a young healthy person and put them in the emergency department within 24 hours,” said Schaffner.
While doctors encourage patients to exercise caution, not all are surprised by the 30 pediatric deaths the flu has caused this season. Fauci added that college-aged students are not a high-risk population.
“The good news is that people within the age bracket of college students rarely have serious complications,” Fauci said.
Still, Perry said getting the flu vaccine is a good idea.  “Some experts suggest that those who receive the vaccine tend to have a milder illness even if they do get the flu,” he said.
In his email, Perry encouraged students to still receive the vaccine if they have not already.
“Flu vaccines are still available, and students can make an appointment to receive one through the HUHS patient portal or by contacting HUHS,” Perry wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 2:30 p.m.
Publicly backing Republican politicians is not a common pastime for Harvard Law professors, many of whom are known for their liberal beliefs. But in recent months, professor of Law emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz has emerged as one of President Donald Trump’s most vocal intellectual defenders.
Though he is a lifelong Democrat, Dershowitz is famous for speaking out on controversial issues regardless of who he supports in the ballot box. In recent months, Dershowitz has taken to Fox News, CNN, and the pages of the Boston Globe and the Washington Examiner to defend Trump’s legal authority on certain actions as well as the state of his mental health.
“We are all entitled to our opinions regarding the president’s political and personal qualifications to serve. I voted for Hillary Clinton in the last election because I felt she was more qualified than Donald Trump to be president. That is my right as an American voter,” he wrote in the Examiner. “But psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have no more right to pathologize a president or a candidate because they disagree with his or her political views than do prosecutors or politicians have a right to criminalize political opponents.”
Writing in the Globe, Dershowitz challenged Senator Dianne Feinstein’s assertion that Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James B. Comey could amount to obstruction of justice. Pulling references from the Constitution and history, Dershowitz refuted the Democratic senator’s statements in a 831-word op-ed in December.
Topping Dershowitz's advocacy, his latest book, “Trumped Up: How Criminalization of Political Differences Endangers Democracy,” hit bookstores in August.
Trump, in turn, has seized on Dershowitz as his intellectual champion and as a source of legitimacy. Trump recently wrote on Twitter that Dershowitz is a "must watch."
“Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history," Trump wrote. "Enjoy!”
In a Dec. 2017 interview with the New York Times, Trump called Dershowitz “amazing” and said he has “seen him a number of times.”
Dershowitz’s Democratic track record seems to enthrall the President; in the December Times interview, Trump repeatedly referred to Dershowitz as “a liberal Democrat” before citing the professor’s media appearances to back up his claim that his campaign did not collude with the Russians.
“I watched Alan Dershowitz the other day, he said, No. 1, there is no collusion, No. 2, collusion is not a crime, but even if it was a crime, there was no collusion,” Trump told the Times. “And he said that very strongly. He said there was no collusion. And he has studied this thing very closely.”
While Dershowitz has publicly defended the legal authority of Trump and some of his policies, he said he wants to make it clear that he is not a supporter of the president.
“I do not support Trump. I do not support his policies, I go out of my way to condemn his policies. I am not giving him legal advice, I am stating in public what the law is and what the law should be,” Dershowitz said in an interview Thursday.
If Hillary Clinton had been elected president, Dershowitz said he would be making legal arguments similar to those he is making now, with one critical difference: he would have the backing of the Harvard Law School faculty.
“The difference is, I would be joined in those arguments by my colleagues at Harvard, on the left, who are now making the exact opposite arguments. The Republicans would be shouting ‘lock her up’ and trying to impeach her and I would be on the forefront of defending her,” Dershowitz said.
While Harvard Law School is now headed by a conservative dean, the school still falls on the left of the political spectrum. During the Obama administration, at least six Law School professors departed the school to take jobs in the White House. The Clinton campaign approached several Law professors about taking posts in Hillary Clinton’s administration ahead of the 2016 election.
When Trump won, surprising many at Harvard, prominent Law School affiliates were quick to denounce him: professor Lawrence H. Tribe sued Trump in January, and former Dean Martha L. Minow wrote an op-ed sharply rebuking him the following month. And the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic at the Law School has spent the past year defending the University and its affiliates against Trump’s immigration policies.
Dershowitz was quick to call out what he sees as hypocrisy among his liberal-leaning colleagues.
“The difference between me and some of my colleagues is I put my views of the Constitution, my views of the rule of law before my partisanship and I make the same arguments, no matter who is the target, no matter who is the president,” he said.
Despite his repeated declarations that he does not agree with the President, Dershowitz’s newfound rapport with Trump has caused some rifts with people close to him, including friends and family. In recent weeks, he and Tribe have sparred on Twitter, and Dershowitz told Politico his public statements on Trump have cost him dinner invites.
“Many of my friends understand what I’m doing. Some don’t out of ignorance, and some don’t out of malice. There are some friends who clearly understand what I am doing but they pretend to misunderstand it,” Dershowitz said in the Thursday interview.
Even at the cost of personal relationships, Dershowitz said he stands by his statements on Trump and his willingness to make the case for controversial positions.
“I get criticism because of my defense of Israel. I get criticism because I’ve defended O.J. Simpson. I get criticism because I defend the free speech of racists and sexists,” he said. “My life is filled with being criticized for standing up for principle. I’m not going to compromise my principles and if anybody is a real friend, they are going to understand that.”

UPDATED: January 31, 2018 at 5:47 p.m.
A new online course from the Graduate School of Design will offer students from around the world the opportunity to study the fundamentals of architecture from Harvard professors for free.
The 10-week course, which launched on Feb. 28, 2017 and is now live and available to enrollees, will explore a variety of topics spanning the history of influences of architecture. Design School professors Erika Naginski, Antoine Picon, and K. Michael Hays, alongside PhD student Lisa Haber-Thomson, produced the lessons.
According to a course summary posted online, the purpose of the initiative is to give students a greater understanding of the wider impacts of architecture, as well as the discipline’s influence on technology and history.
“In this course, you will learn how to ‘read’ architecture as a cultural expression as well as a technical achievement,” the summary reads.
The course is divided into three parts. The first phase introduces the idea of the “architectural imagination” as a medium to “share sensuous experience and conceptual understanding.” Using methods like perspective drawing and architectural typology, students will learn about the historical impacts of architecture.The second phase will analyze how technology impacts the creation of architecture as a component of its “realization and understanding.” Lectures will cover topics like how the materials of construction often determine the architectural forms and viability of a structure, or how architecture and modern technology have changed the what can be built—and what counts as a building.
The final set of modules will analyze the complex relationship architecture has to its “social and historical contexts” and its “audiences, achievements and aspiration,” including its aesthetic power to negotiate social change to express society’s ideals.
The course will not count for credit, but people who take the course can buy a certificate once they complete the class.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
UPDATED: January 31, 2018
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that the Graduate School of Design course is set to launch on Feb. 28, 2018. In fact, the course launched on that date in 2017.

Liz P. Kantor ’18 was sitting at a lab bench working on her thesis when she got the text: The Hasty Pudding Theatricals group would allow women to join its historically all-male cast for the first time in almost 200 years.
Kantor—who auditioned for the Pudding unsuccessfully for three years straight—said she broke down in tears at her desk.
“Obviously the first reaction to any of us was complete joy,” Kantor said. “I’m especially grateful to all of the women who have fought with me for the last three years.”
Kantor is one of at least 17 Harvard women who tried and failed to join the Pudding’s cast over the past three years. But no longer—Pudding President Amira T. Weeks ’18 announced at the group’s Woman of the Year festivities Thursday that the organization will allow women to join its 2019 cast.
As news of the Pudding’s decision spread on social media Thursday night, women across campus—especially those rejected at past auditions—vowed they would return to the stage to try out for the group.
“Whenever I tell people I go to Harvard and I’m interested in theater, they always mention the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and I always have to tell them they don’t accept women so unfortunately that’s not an option for me,” Chloe Saracco ’21 said. “But this changes the whole game.”
Saracco, who attempted to join the Pudding’s cast last semester, said she will “definitely” be auditioning in fall 2018. Elle Shaheen ’21, who also auditioned unsuccessfully last fall, said she “certainly” plans to try out next year.
Both said they are thrilled at the prospect of joining the Pudding, the oldest collegiate theatrical group in the country.
“In the event that they really follow through and not only just audition women but choose to accept women into the group, I’m really excited to be able to take part in one of Harvard’s greatest and most historical groups on campus,” Saracco said.
Senior women who auditioned for the Pudding in the past said Thursday’s news came as the culmination of years of effort. The Pudding first considered accepting female performers when 17 women signed up to audition for the troupe’s annual spring production in Sept. 2015.
“The first time I auditioned I was a freshman,” said Madison Deming ’18, who numbered among the 17 original Pudding hopefuls. “It was really frightening because you’re going into a room not only as an actor performing in front of a professional team, but also knowing that you’re doing something that’s personally wasting their time because they’re not going to let women into their cast.”
Shaheen also remembered her Pudding audition as dispiriting. She said it was “startling” to hear she would not receive a callback because of her gender.
“It was the first time I had felt like I couldn’t do something because I was a woman,” she said. “Theater should be an all-inclusive activity.”
Deming, Lazar, Shaheen, and Saracco said they are pleased that months and months of advocacy finally paid off. Lazar also thanked actress Mila Kunis—the 2018 Pudding Woman of the Year—for her support for the push to go co-ed.
At a press conference after Thursday’s Woman of the Year festivities, Kunis said she would not have attended the celebration had the Pudding not chosen to accept women as cast members. Kunis also said she “knew that this was going to happen” before the club made the announcement Thursday.
Looking back on the last three years, Deming said she thinks the Pudding’s policy shift is long overdue.
“We’ve been advocating for this for a while,” Deming said. “The fact that the grad board has finally come around is great.”
“I think it’s about time,” she added.

Coming off its first conference win, Harvard women’s basketball hopes to improve to 8-0 at home with Ivy League weekend matchups against rivals Yale and Brown.
The Crimson (9-6, 1-1 Ivy) has not lost a home game since March 4, 2017, and looks to continue the streak in its first full weekend slate of conference play. Lavietes Pavilion has been a welcome home for Harvard against the Bulldogs (8-7, 1-1) and the Bears (13-2, 1-1). Yale’s last win in Cambridge came in 2012, and Brown has not beaten the Crimson on the road since 2015.
Harvard has won four of its last five in a span of hotly contested battles with non-conference and Ancient Eight opponents alike. This weekend marks the middle of its all-important opening Ivy League home stretch, with two more home Ivy League games before traveling again in February.
Although the Crimson has been playing well in the new year, Harvard is still haunted by the same issues it has been working to correct since the start of the season. The Crimson has been plagued by the turnover bug all season, giving the ball up at least 10 times in every game since an early road loss to Temple on Dec. 2. Harvard has averaged 15.7 turnovers per game so far this season. Its turnover margin of -2.33 per game is seventh in the Ancient Eight, ahead of only Columbia.
However, the point of emphasis on turnovers is slowly showing in important games, as the Crimson tallied just 11 giveaways against Dartmouth in its first conference victory this season.
“We’re coming off of a really great win this past weekend against Dartmouth,” senior co-captain Kirby Porter said. “That really served as a coming together moment for us, showing what we’re capable of on the floor.”
This improvement in turnovers will be a key this weekend, as the Bulldogs boast the best turnover margin in the conference at +5.60, thanks to an Ivy League-best 11.7 steals per game. No other team in the conference averages more than 9.6.
The pilfering Yale defense will force Harvard’s offense to avoid making turnovers, and the Crimson’s defense likewise will have its hands full all weekend. The Bears and the Bulldogs score more points than any other Ancient Eight teams. Brown has averaged 80.9 points a game, while Yale’s 70.6 is good for second best in the conference.
“Brown is a team full of scorers, but we trust our defense and trust our plan,” Porter said.
Harvard’s first two Ivy League games saw the defense concerned with the shooters of Dartmouth, the best team from behind the arc in the Ancient Eight so far this season. The Bulldogs are an entirely different matchup, shooting only 26.9 percent from beyond the arc, making paint dominance a key to their game. The Crimson will rely on sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm, who has posted 2.5 blocks per game this season, to control the game down low. Harvard has seen success down low so far this season, with its 41.9 rebounds per game second in the conference only to the Bears.
Brown’s offense is not as one-dimensional as Yale’s. The Bears’ league-best 46.1 rebounds per game are complemented by its shooting. Brown is second in the league in field goal shooting percentage with 42.3 percent. In addition, the Bears share the ball well, leading the Ivies in assists with 5.9 per game.
“We’ve been preparing a lot for their style of play, which is certainly different from the rest of the Ivies,” Boehm said. “They have that run-and-gun, and they like to shoot early in the shot clock.”
Brown’s electric offense has carried them to victories all season, as the Bears’ defense has been the worst scoring defense in the Ivy League, allowing 70.1 points per game.
The Crimson will look to capitalize on Brown’s weakness on the defensive side of the ball by sharing the basketball among its many scorers. Harvard, Brown, and Yale are the only teams in the Ancient Eight to boast three players averaging double-digit points per game. The Crimson’s top scoring trio of sophomore guard Katie Benzan, senior guard Taylor Rooks, and Boehm have averaged 12.6, 11.6, and 11.1 points per game, respectively. Ball sharing among the multiple scorers will be a key in a weekend chock-full of offensive weapons for each of Harvard’s rivals.
The rivalry against the Bulldogs specifically ignites a special type of excitement for the players.
“Harvard-Yale is always an easy one to get up for,” Boehm said. “We’re really excited.”
For Porter and senior guard Taylor Rooks, this matchup against rival Yale will be the final time they will host the Bulldogs in Lavietes.
“The senior feeling is just starting to hit me,” Porter said. “It’s a weird feeling to be completely honest.”
However, the importance of Ivy League play is not to be overshadowed by the rivalry.
“What’s important right now is getting these wins and getting into the Ivy League Tournament,” Porter said.

This weekend marks the beginning of a six-week stretch of back-to-back conference basketball games—one of the Ivy League’s quirkiest sports traditions—for the Harvard men’s and women’s teams. Save for a few exceptions, over the next six weekends, each Ancient Eight team will play two games per weekend (one on Friday night and the other on Saturday) with both coming either at home or on the road.
If you haven’t been following Ivy League basketball up until this point, have no fear. We’ll give you all that you need to know about the conference’s eight teams, the five games today and tomorrow, and an outlook for the upcoming six weekends.
Last year’s conference marathon saw Princeton go a perfect 14-0 in league play—the conference’s first undefeated regular season since 2007-2008—en route to a championship in the inaugural Ivy League Tournament. The Tigers fell to No. 5 seed Notre Dame in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. It was the second year in a row that the league produced a 12-seed for the tournament, the highest seed an Ivy League team has received since Penn was an 11-seed in 2003.
Fast-forward nine months and the dominance of Princeton and the Ivy League’s reputation as a premier mid-major conference have been replaced by parity (through 10 conference games) and a belief that 2017-2018 is a “down year” for the conference. While the conference is arguably as talented as ever from a talent point of view, only Penn and Brown (BROWN!) posted nonconference records above .500. In the latest edition of ESPN’s Bracketology, Joe Lunardi picks Penn as his Ivy League champion but slots the Quakers as a 15 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
If you love parity, boy, would you have enjoyed the last two-plus months of Ivy League basketball. The Ancient Eight has had its fair share of good (Cornell’s Matt Morgan and his 23.3 points per game, Penn’s quadruple-overtime win over Monmouth, Princeton’s victory at USC), bad (Cornell’s decision to play at UMass Lowell, Cornell’s subsequent 20-point loss to UMass Lowell, and Evan Boudreaux’s decision to transfer from Dartmouth), and ugly (a Harvard-Fordham game that produced 92 total points, a decision to implement Flannel Night at a Dartmouth basketball game, and New Haven, Conn.).
Harvard, Princeton, and Yale—the top three teams in the conference last season and the projected top three in the preseason poll—have all faced their fair share of struggles to begin the season. Sophomore guard Bryce Aiken—the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year—has missed six games for a Harvard team that leads the conference in turnovers. Last season, the Crimson loved the three ball more than Winthrop loves testing its fire alarms but shot 28.2 percent from long range during nonconference play this year
Princeton boasts the conference’s most talented and experienced backcourt, but its frontcourt lacks playmakers and struggles to rebound. Yale lost sophomore forward Jordan Bruner—one of the top rookies in the conference a year ago—for the season and senior point guard Makai Mason—a first team All-Ivy pick in 2015-2016—has yet to play in a game this year after suffering a stress fracture in his foot.
Each summer, Deadspin produces a series called “Why Your Team Sucks”, in which its writers pen articles finding flaws for all 32 NFL teams and their fanbases. Entering the season, it looked like the “Why Your Team Sucks” for the Brown men’s basketball team would be longer than the syllabus for Sociology 175 (15 pages, single-spaced), but Mike Martin and company have surprised some people. Like Harvard’s, the Bears’ rotation is primarily composed of underclassmen. Sophomore Brandon Anderson and freshman Desmond Cambridge are both averaging over 15 points a game while shooting over 40 percent from the field.
It’s Brown, so a successful season means putting up 100 points on in-state rival Johnson & Wales (check) and having Jordan Spieth in attendance at one of its home games (probably not happening this year), but sneaking into the conference tournament as the four-seed doesn’t seem out of the question for a team that currently holds both the Ivy League’s fifth-highest Pomeroy College Basketball Ranking and its fifth-highest acceptance rate. If this mediocrity is intentional, don’t be surprised to see Jeff Fisher replace Phil Estes as the school’s football coach in the near future.
That’s not to say that the rest of the conference is without its flaws. Columbia won just three games in nonconference play (including one against Sarah Lawrence College) and is 1-9 in road games. Cornell junior guard Matt Morgan is arguably the best offensive player in the Ivy League yet his team has managed to concede more than 80 points eight times this season (including 91 to a Princeton team that averages 71.4).
Dartmouth cannot score to save its life and saw its best player announce thathe was transferring the day before the Big Green’s first game of the season. That’s almost as little notice as the Saints’ Marcus Williams gave fellow defensive back Ken Crawley before taking out his legs.
Penn currently sits in first place in the Ivy League despite shooting a putrid 63.2 percent from the free throw line, good for 343rd out of 351 eligible NCAA teams. If there’s one thing to say about the Ancient Eight as its teams enter the meat of the conference schedule, it’s that this year it’s anyone’s league.
DARTMOUTH AT BROWN
Don’t let matchup this distract you from the fact that Dartmouth played a month of basketball last season without winning a single game.
That’s right, between its first game on Nov. 11 and a Dec. 18 win against LIU-Brooklyn, the Big Green went 0-9 to start last season. We’re not an Ivy League records keeper, but by any standard that’s really bad. To add insult to injury, Dartmouth lost what might have been its only good player when former Ivy League Rookie of the Year and two-time All-Ivy Second Team forward Evan Boudreaux decided to take his talents to Xavier.
I guess the grass is greener when not playing for the Big Green.
Let’s not forget Brown, though. Much like Dartmouth, the Bears lost an equally talented big man with an equally strange looking jump shot—forward Steven Spieth, best known for being Jordan Spieth’s younger brother. That’s not being mean, that’s actually the first thing that comes up when you Google him.
Nonetheless, Brown comes into the matchup as one of just three Ivy League teams with an overall winning record, which is unexpected to say the least.
What’s more surprising, though, is that last weekend Brown beat a Yale team that nearly beat out Harvard as the preseason favorite to win the conference.
Let’s go back two years.
It’s March of 2016. Yale goes to its first NCAA tournament in over 50 years. Somehow No. 12 Yale beats No. 5 Baylor for its first ever tournament win. It’s kind of a big deal.
What’s better though is Baylor senior Taurean Prince’s postgame interview.
Clearly stunned by the outcome a reported asks quite bluntly, “How does Yale out-rebound Baylor??”
Prince, clearly unimpressed, proceeded to give the definition of a rebound and says that Yale got more of those than the Bears did.
After last weekend though, we kind of understand the awe behind that question, albeit a little differently. I mean really, how does Brown beat Yale?
Either way, good for Brown. Also, Dartmouth comes in red hot with a five-game losing streak.
Pick: Brown
HARVARD AT YALE
If we really wanted to, we could hype up this matchup. After all, the Crimson narrowly beat out the Bulldogs as preseason favorites despite Yale earning two more first place votes than Harvard.
We could talk about how the Crimson lost to the Bulldogs in the inaugural Ivy League tournament after beating them twice in the regular season. We could talk about how Yale coach James Jones really, really doesn’t like Harvard. We could even talk about football—after seeing its team lose at home to the Crimson last season, the Yale crowd erupted into chants of “Let’s play football.” It was hilarious. We could dig even further, to 2015 when the two matched up in a winner-take-all playoff game and the Crimson came out on top to rob the Bulldogs of their first chance to dance in a long time.
The truth of the matter, though, is that both of these teams have been as lackluster and as injury-plagued as Derrick Rose.
Let me also just say that, as a Chicago native, that one really hurt to write.
Harvard enters as the Golden State Warriors of the matchup—only imagine the Warriors shooting 30 percent from three and Steph Curry is playing four minutes a game at the moment.
Yale is kind of like the Hornets—they were supposed to compete with anyone except then they lost to everyone and then they lost to Brown too. Also imagine they’re all on crutches.
That’s the sad reality of this matchup. Harvard guard Bryce Aiken comes in recovering from a knee injury while Yale lost forward Jordan Bruner to a meniscus tear and Makai Mason has yet to make his return to the court.
Twenty years ago today, Bill Clinton (a 1973 graduate of Yale Law School) denied having had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky on national television. What we can’t deny, though, is that one injured player is less than two.
Pick: Harvard
HARVARD AT BROWN
According to the Brown Daily Herald, Brown’s growing Computer Science department is struggling to pay its teaching assistants—it’s not the only instance of struggle in Providence, though. While the Bears have a winning record, I’m not sure it counts if wins come against schools such as Division III Johnson & Wales. This might be closer than people think, but the Brown Bears remain cubs for the time being.
Pick: Harvard
COLUMBIA AT CORNELL
Ah, the Gentleman C’s.
We did a bit of research and realized the phrase does not actually refer to Cornell and Columbia—instead it was actually a phrase used to describe the grade given to the children of wealthy parents who would have otherwise had a failing grade. I guess the moniker is a bit accurate then—Columbia and Cornell definitely fit the bill of institutions buoyed by association.
Regardless, all the money in the world probably couldn’t buy Cornell a good roster.
Even though the Lions enter with just four wins and pulled a Dartmouth of their own—losing nine consecutively in the span of a month—we think a nearly 40-point loss against Princeton and a 26-point loss at Columbia says it all. On the bright side, it will be “Kids Day!” in Ithaca on Saturday.
Pour one out for the Big Red.
Pick: Columbia
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
We might be beating a dead horse here, but Brown beating Yale was definitely out of touch with the order of the world. If Dartmouth could do the same, then this might be the rapture.
Pick: Yale

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not many goaltenders blank the Harvard men’s hockey team, so it takes a special net-minder to do so. On Friday night against No. 2/4 Cornell, however, the Crimson (9-7-4, 8-4-3 ECAC) ran into a very special goalie indeed.
This goalie was freshman Matthew Galajda, who sent back all 35 of Harvard’s shot attempts en route to his third straight shutout in a 3-0 victory for the Big Red (17-2-1, 11-1-1). The bout marks the Crimson’s first goalless game since almost exactly one year ago, when RPI shut down the squad on Jan. 29, 4-0.
“[Galajda] is calm,” Cornell coach Mike Schafer ’86 said. “He doesn’t get run around or sliding around in there. He stays focused…. He’s playing well, and our guys are selfless. They’re laying it out, blocking shots when they have to.”
Harvard came into the game seeking vengeance after November’s heartbreaking loss, which saw the Big Red steal the game in the final seconds. That evening, Crimson Coach Ted Donato ’91 and his team left Lynah rink feeling robbed, confident that their play warranted a better result than a regulation defeat.
Friday, though, there was no question which team deserved the victory.
“I was more frustrated the first time we played them,” coach Donato admitted. “I thought we played better and deserved a better fate. They deserved to win tonight. They made the plays, they blocked the shots, they made the saves.”
After a Cornell goal just eight minutes into the tilt, the game remained a one-shot affair until early in the third frame when the Big Red padded its lead. The culprit was a repeat offender, as junior forward Anthony Angello was responsible for all three Cornell goals on the evening.
The Pittsburgh Penguins prospect reached the double-digit goal plateau with six and a half minutes expired in the third period. Angello’s wrister rung off the pipe before bouncing off the back of Harvard goaltender Michael Lackey and trickling over the goal line.
“They got a bounce on the second goal,” coach Donato said. “They’re playing defense at a level right now that made that [two-goal lead] look like a pretty steep hill to climb.”
Angello followed up with an empty-netter with just one second remaining in the game, completing the hat trick. The Manlius, N.Y., native now has nine goals in as many outings.
While providing some cushion to the Big Red’s lead, Angello’s three-goal effort proved unnecessary. Galajda, who entered the contest with the second-best goals against average and fifth-best save percentage in the NCAA, demonstrated why his numbers are so stellar.
The rookie stood tall between the pipes all night, recording his sixth clean sheet this season in 17 appearances.
“I’m seeing the puck well,” said Galajda of his recent play. “There [were] a couple of plays out there where maybe I got a little lucky tonight. The puck seems to be bouncing our way right now, and [we’ll] keep it rolling tomorrow night.”
The Crimson’s 35 shots were no match for Galajda, who saw most of Harvard’s chances cleanly.
“I would’ve liked us to make it a little bit more difficult for [Galajda],” coach Donato said. “I don’t think we got enough traffic, I don’t think we made him [scramble] around the front of the net. But hats off to him.”
Solid puck fielding also kept the home team in it for the majority of the game. Lackey sent away 25 shots (2.07 GAA, .926 SV%) and made some crucial stops for the Crimson. At the end of the day, a hard-to-read release and a bad bounce bested him.
The second period began much like the first ended. Chances were scarce, but many were grade-A looks—the only difference being that Harvard started accumulating more shots on goal than the opposition. By the end of the frame, the pace resembled that of a typical bout between these two fast and skilled teams.
While Cornell led the shot count 7-2 at one point in the opening third, the Crimson ultimately overtook this category and took a 20-13 advantage into the locker room after 40 minutes. A power play straddling the midway point of the second period opened up the offense for Harvard while giving the Big Red a series of counter-attack rushes.
“I thought the second period was our best,” coach Donato reflected. “The first 10 minutes of the game, they pinned us back a little bit. The second 10, I thought we played pretty well. And then the second period, we had chances.”
Despite multiple sequences of pandemonium in front of Galajda and a few point-blank opportunities on Lackey, the net-minders rejected all 19 shots they collectively faced in the frame.
Back in November, it was Harvard who got off to a hot start and drew first blood. As the goose egg would indicate, this was obviously not the case Friday night. Angello lit the lamp seven minutes into the contest.
The junior strode into the zone and slipped through two Crimson defenders. Then, the 6’5” winger got his hands free for a split second and cleared Lackey’s shoulder with a quick-release snipe. The tally ushered in the jeers of invading Big Red fans, traveling in droves as always.
The early strike was one of many quality scoring opportunities for the two teams in the first frame. While the foes exited the ice after 20 minutes with just seven shots apiece, the majority of them were in prime position. Both Galajda and Lackey faced frenzies in front of their respective nets but managed to keep the rest of the pucks from crossing the goal line.
Most notably in the opening third, junior forward Michael Floodstrand fired a shot low on the Big Red backstop, who kicked the puck out into the high slot. Floodstrand’s linemate Benjamin Solin was there to corral the rebound and send another attempt toward Galajda, but the freshman tender gobbled up the second-chance shot.
Like his fellow Harvard icemen on Friday, junior forward Ryan Donato failed to notch a point. This marks just the second game all season in which the 2018 Olympian failed to ink the score sheet.
“All four lines knew when [Donato] was on the ice,” coach Schafer said. “You better play him one-on-one strong. You better keep your feet moving against him, especially as a defenseman…. If you spread your feet and try and play him, he’s going to make you look silly. He got to the other side on us a couple of times tonight, but that’s fine. He didn’t get to his forehand.”
Cornell’s decisive shutout removed any doubt lingering from the teams’ last meeting, in which the Big Red ran away with the game in its waning moments.
“It was awesome beating Harvard at home,” Angello said. “Getting them 2-0 [on the season] here…especially when they don’t score, it’s definitely something really special.”

Flyby got a chance to talk to your new UC president and vice president, Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Nicholas D. Boucher ’19. Harvard, you have no idea what you’ve gotten yourselves into with this ticket. Here’s what went down.
Flyby: How much “water” did you both drink after winning the election?
Nick: Enough to get through a stat pset right afterwards.  Which is a lot.
Cat: Only the water that Yaz and Cam bestowed upon us afterwards.
Flyby: Do you watch House of Cards?
Cat and Nick: ...No, not really.
This is the only reason necessary to impeach them.
Flyby:  The next question was about pushing one of your political enemies off a T platform, so…
Cat: Mmmm...Interesting.
Flyby:  Wait, do you plan to push one of your political enemies off a T platform?
Cat: Wait, when you mean off a T platform, do you mean…
Flyby:  Into an oncoming train, yes.
Nick: See...the biggest problem here is that it takes tax dollars to clean up the mess.  So, if we were to do it we’d probably be much cleaner.
Cat:  I’m too shook.
Nick:  We’re really big on financial efficiency.
Clearly, Nick has thought about this. That's not worrying at all.
Flyby:  But given how slow the T is would it even matter? Would they even die?
Cat: That’s true. You’d have to time where you did it because the T just stops randomly now.
Nick: Biophysically speaking, one of the rails is electrified. So presumably they could also just shock to death. Hey, am I crazy? Maybe I’m not…
Flyby: Hey, it’s ingenuity.
Nick: That’s right.  We’re all about innovation. Creativity. Using things in new ways.
Cat: That’s true. That’s very true.
UC reps had better watch their backs...
Flyby: Any funny stories from the campaign?
Nick:  I can think of a fun one!
Thank God.
Nick: One of the printers was running out of ink, and when we were printing it just turned out green...like aliens.
Guess not.  
Flyby: Who do you now declare to be “losers”?
Nick: Harvard.
Our thoughts exactly.
Flyby:  Let’s play a game.  Yay, nay, or “I couldn’t possibly comment”? Yale?
Cat: Nay.
Nick: Nay.
Rakesh Rapping Hamilton?
Cat: Yay.
Nick: Yay.
Lamont?
Cat: Nay.
Nick: Oy.
Consulting?
Cat and Nick: Yay if it’s yay for you, nay if it’s nay for you.
Are you politicians or something?
In all seriousness, we’d like to thank Cat and Nick for the opportunity to interview them and their good sense of humor. See them in action at UC meetings this year.

Committees, administrative officials, and even students are deep into the process of finding a suitable replacement for University President Drew G. Faust, bringing up many questions, including: What does the president of Harvard actually do? Here are a few theories.
Help Consume Leftover D-hall Food
Yes, sustainability is an important concept that Harvard has repeatedly stressed. And what better way to practice sustainability than to let the top dog chow down on all those leftovers? Seems like a better solution than those dorm room compost bins...
Terrorize Final Club Members
Whether skewing the male/female ratio at parties or stealing the Canada Goose jackets tossed into the corner, it is the President’s responsibility to bring down these organizations.
Hand out Halloween Candy
The public rarely gets to see the president, except for a few special occasions. This Halloween, many undergraduate students had to opportunity to receive copious amounts of candy from Faust herself at Mass. Hall. Such prolonged exposure to the masses must have been exhausting. It could be a while before we see the president again.
Reenact the Battle of Gettysburg
As a renowned historian of the Civil War, it’s understandable that President Faust misses her past profession. If you ever happen to hear booms coming from the closed doors of her office, it’s probably the gold-lined cannons that she purchased from eBay to complete her battlefield set.
In reality, however, President Faust does some serious decision-making for and supervision of Harvard’s structure and administration. With an increased focus on fundraising campaigns and educational and diversity initiatives, the President leads a very busy life that is influential on the Harvard community. We’ll all be sad to see her leaving next year.
