After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Dean of Harvard Law School Martha L. Minow will step down at the end of the academic year to return to teaching full-time, ending an eight-year tenure as dean that spanned a global financial crisis, federal Title IX scrutiny, and widespread student protest.
In her email Tuesday announcing that she will step down, Minow also wrote that the Law School has surpassed its capital campaign goal of $305 million. Minow has served as dean for the past eight years, but started her career at the Law School in 1981 as an assistant professor. During her time as dean she served as the chair of the Deans Steering Committee of the Association of American Schools, as the vice-chair of the Legal Services Corporation, and continued to teach courses.
“Being a scholar and a teacher was my highest aspiration. I’ve loved it and I am eager to return to it,” Minow said in an interview. “I became dean at a challenging time in the school and agreed to be dean for five years, and... now it’ll be eight, and it’s time to get back to being a professor.”
Minow will leave the helm of the Law School in the midst of a capital campaign and planning for the school’s bicentennial celebrations, happening this year. University President Drew G. Faust will begin a search for Minow’s successor “soon,” according to the announcement.
“The bicentennial plans are well on the way,” Minow said. “I very much look forward to participating in the event. I think it’s a great way for a new dean to launch the third century of the Law School with an opportunity to look back and to look forward.”
Law School affiliates commended Minow’s leadership and said they are optimistic about the future of the school.
“I cannot imagine as good a dean for the Law School [as Minow],” Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe said. “I think that Drew Faust made a wise and brilliant selection in persuading Martha to become dean of the law school and I look forward to working with President Faust to finding a successor, but I think Martha’s shoes are impossible to fill.”
Minow became dean in 2009 on the heels of the financial crisis, a time of economic upheaval at the school and in the legal profession. She oversaw campus renovations during a period of budgetary constraints, as well as the expansion of the school’s clinical and research programs.
Minow assumed leadership of the school shortly after the conclusion of its last capital campaign, which raised a record-breaking $476 million. The Law School launched its most recent—and more modest—campaign in 2013 as part of the current University-wide “One Harvard” capital campaign.
The last years of Minow’s tenure were sometimes turbulent. Federal investigators found the Law School in violation of Title IX in Dec. 2014, sparking intense debate over Title IX procedures and tensions between the Law School faculty and central administrators. In 2015, Minow oversaw implementation of Law School-specific Title IX procedures separate from those at the University’s central Title IX office.
Last year, she came under fire as student activists called on administrators to make the school more welcoming to students of color. Activists later occupied the school’s student lounge and protested an award ceremony in Minow’s honor at Brandeis University, charging that she had not adequately met their demands.
Faculty and alumni, however, applauded her efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. Minow took a number of steps to respond to student demands, including appointing a committee last November to reconsider the school’s controversial seal. In March, the school removed the seal, which is the crest of a formerly slaveholding family.
Nino Monea, the Law School’s student body president, said he enjoyed working with Minow, even as he challenged her and the administration to address student concerns.
“Despite the years where I push the school to be better, I’ve been happy working with her,” Monea said. “She’s always been open to meeting with us, the student government, and I do believe that she did help play a role in those kinds of steps like the seal and just helping improve the culture of the school.”
The last time the Law School sought a new dean, in 2009, the secretive process that ended with Faust selecting Minow lasted about six months. Many of the leading candidates were professors on the Law School faculty, but there was no clear frontrunner until just prior to the school’s internal deadline for selecting a new dean.
Minow said she is optimistic the University can select her successor before the summer begins.
“I believe that President Faust will soon convene a search committee and has six months to find a new dean,” Minow said. “I believe and hope that she will find one in that time period.”
Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz said he doubted the University would need to select an interim dean, and that the school would draw its candidates from the current faculty.
“I don’t think they’ll have an interim dean, I think they’ll have a dean. She’s not leaving until the summer so there’s plenty of time,” Dershowitz said. “Normally, Harvard gets candidates from inside the faculty and I suspect that’s what will happen this time as well.”
Tribe said the next dean of the Law School will need to be able to navigate the Law School’s place in the United States’ tumultuous political landscape.
“I think that it’s vital that we have a dean who, like Martha Minow, is open to diverse views, has a deep commitment to teaching and scholarship, is concerned with the way in which people of color and other marginalized groups have felt excluded,” Tribe said.
Law School professor Bruce H. Mann said he regarded Minow as someone who lives by her principles and has done a terrific job of leading the Law School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan described efforts to improve the performance of Harvard Management Company in a letter responding to alumni concerned that the University's investment arm overcompensates its executives.
Finnegan’s letter, dated Dec. 23, comes a month after a group of alumni from the class of 1969 wrote a letter to the Harvard Corporation arguing that HMC pays its executives too much money considering the $35.7 billion endowment's recent poor performance. The signatories called on the University to stop the “unjustifiable” compensation and to increase transparency around how HMC manages the endowment.
While not directly addressing the group’s concerns over the total level of compensation, Finnegan, a member of the Harvard Corporation, listed six “work streams” HMC has already started to improve the firm’s performance. He also detailed former HMC CEO Stephen Blyth’s decision to hire the consulting firm McKinsey and Company for a candid and sometimes harsh review of the organization.
The McKinsey report, Finnegan wrote, was in response to Harvard's recent endowment performance; it has grown more slowly than the endowments at its peer schools. Most recently, in fiscal year 2016, the value of Harvard's endowment dropped almost $2 billion as HMC posted a negative 2 percent return—the second lowest return among Ivy League endowments.
“The report took as a premise that HMC, after many years of superior performance, had for several years not performed as well as some of its leading peers, and it offered recommendations on a forward course,” Finnegan wrote.
Finnegan wrote that the new initiatives intended to improve HMC include developing “more clearly defined investment objectives.” While HMC has lagged behind peer institutions for years, it has frequently surpassed its own internal benchmarks: fiscal year 2016 was the first since fiscal year 2009 that HMC did not beat its overall internal goal. In the McKinsey report, excerpts of which were published in Bloomberg, employees blamed the easily attainable benchmarks for fostering a complacent culture at HMC.
In addition, Finnegan's letter delineates that the fund has altered compensation to tie individual compensation more closely to HMC’s overall performance starting in fiscal year 2017, and that it is moving away from focusing on individual asset classes and “towards a more flexible and collaborative approach.”
Finnegan also wrote that HMC has “embraced a set of recommendations on how to enhance aspects of the firm’s organizational culture.” HMC spokesperson Emily Guadagnoli declined to comment on what these recommendations were.
In response to Finnegan’s letter, the group of alumni penned a press release blasting the University’s  “clearly inadequate” response, arguing that it “provides platitudes rather than the specifics about whatever changes are being made.”
“Finnegan ignored the Committee’s demand for greater transparency, as well as its assertion that a non-profit education institution such as Harvard should not provide multi-million-dollar bonus compensation to its money managers,” the alumni wrote.
N.P.  Narvekar—formerly the head of Columbia’s endowment—took over as CEO of HMC in December from interim CEO Robert A. Ettl, who filled in after Blyth resigned in July. Bloomberg reported last month that Narvekar postponed HMC’s annual Winter Gala as he conducted a review of the fund.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an unbeaten month of December, the Harvard men’s basketball team was on the losing side of a high-scoring affair against Vermont Tuesday night. While five Crimson players—including four freshmen—scored in double-digits, it wasn’t enough to overcome the Catamounts as the team fell, 82-71.
“I thought their team was poised and was balanced when we made runs at them,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We didn’t have enough to push it through when we had opportunities.”
BYE BYE BRYCE
Freshman Bryce Aiken has been an unstoppable offensive force through the past few games for the Crimson (6-5) and has led the team in scoring, averaging over 20 points through the last three games coming into Tuesday night. Scoring on a mix of acrobatic drives to the basket and long-range triples, Amaker has described Aiken as a “shooting guard who can also play the point”, giving him the versatility to play in many different lineups.
Against Vermont (10-5), Aiken came out hot and appeared to be on pace to soar past his personal-best 23 points that the rookie tallied against Howard on Dec. 30. The New Jersey native went to the locker room at the end of the first half with 14 points off 6-of-6 shooting in 16 minutes on the floor.
In the second frame however, Aiken was limited to 10 minutes as he got himself in foul trouble and couldn’t stay in the game. Entering the game in the second half with 15:57 to go, it took less than a minute of play for Aiken to tally a personal foul, his second of the game. The next foul came less than 30 seconds later and forced Amaker to call a timeout to settle his team. After playing clean for the next four minutes, Aiken picked up a fourth with still over 10 minutes to go and went to the bench for over five minutes, over the course of which Vermont would maintain a double-digit lead.
Aiken would be the team’s leading scorer, finishing with 16 points on a last second layup to close out the game, but his absence during key second half minutes would leave the Crimson in a rut it couldn’t escape.
A bright spot, however, was in the rest of the team’s ability to create offense outside of Aiken. Harvard finished with five players in double figures—freshmen Seth Towns, Chris Lewis, and Justin Bassey, along with senior co-captain Siyani Chambers—all had 10-plus on the night.
MISSING DEFENSE
While the Crimson found ways to score on the Catamounts, the team was unable to get stops on the other end of the floor. Vermont topped 50 percent in field goal percentage, with most of its dominance coming in the paint. The home team had 44 of 82 total points from the paint, and only had eight attempts (and four makes) from beyond the arc in the contest.
Amaker typically calls defense the most important part of his teams’ resume, but this season has not lived up to the defensive prowess of past Crimson squads. Much of the regression has been a result of the team’s youth. Though many of Harvard’s young players have been key offensive contributors through the nonconference portion of the season, they have left something to be desired on the defensive end.
“You can see the guys making some of those mistakes were youth, so hopefully some experience will help them,” Amaker said.
One of the causes of his team’s defensive struggles, according to Amaker, is the team’s inability to play without fouling. Vermont went to the foul line 23 times compared to just 12 attempts for the Crimson.
Harvard also struggled on the boards Tuesday, allowing Vermont to get its hands on 15 offensive rebounds, nearly 50 percent of available rebounds as Harvard had only 16 defensive rebounds as a team.
“We need to do a better job of keeping people off the backboard, keeping the guards in front, eliminating penetration,” Amaker said.
The loss comes just a few days before the Crimson kicks off Ivy League play against Dartmouth on Jan. 7. The Big Green has had the lowest scoring offense so far this season of the Ancient Eight teams with 66.8 points per game, while giving up just under 74 points per game to opponents.
