After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A day after tentatively agreeing to a debate co-sponsored by the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate and University of Massachusetts Boston, Senator Scott Brown said Tuesday that he would not participate in the event because of what he felt would be a partisan bias against him.
Hours later, and after Democratic opponent Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren criticized his decision, Brown announced that he would participate in a Boston media consortium debate already agreed to by Warren.
At issue was the politics of Victoria R. Kennedy, the wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 and the chairwoman of the EMK Institute. Brown wrote Monday that he would only participate in the debate if Kennedy agreed to remain politically neutral throughout the race, withholding her likely endorsement for Warren.
It became clear Tuesday that Brown's request would not be met when a letter from EMK Institute CEO Lisa McBirney and University of Massachusetts Boston representative Christopher Hogan declined Brown's request.
"This non-endorsement pledge is unprecedented and is not being required of any other persons or entities,” McBirney and Hogan wrote. “To us, such a pledge seems inappropriate when a non-media sponsor issues a debate invitation. We can assure both campaigns that the debate will be fair, just as the one we cosponsored between Senator Brown and Attorney General Martha Coakley in 2010 was fair.”
Brown's campaign officially withdrew from the debate after receiving the letter.
“We respect Vicki Kennedy’s decision but we regret that we cannot accept a debate invitation from someone who plans to endorse Scott Brown’s opponent,” Brown's campaign manager Jim Barnett said in a statement. “The Kennedy Institute cannot hold itself out as a nonpartisan debate sponsor while the president of its board of trustees gets involved in the race on behalf of one of the candidates.”
Shortly after declining Kennedy, Brown's campaign announced that it would agree to another debate sponsored by a consortium of Boston media. The debate is the third televised engagement agreed to by both candidates.
Brown has also accepted two radio debates that Warren has yet to agree to, the first of which is slated for June 27.
The Kennedy invitation has exposed Brown to criticism as Warren quickly accepted the invitation last week and urged her opponent to do the same.
The Democratic camp almost immediately seized on Brown’s refusal to participate in the Kennedy debate, saying that he has been consistently noncommittal when discussing debates and making new its challenge for him to accept a televised Boston media consortium debate, which he later accepted.
Republican political consultant Todd Domke said Brown's decision to decline the invitation was fair, especially considering Kennedy's ties to Massachusetts Democrats.
"Brown had good reason to ask Vicki Kennedy if she would maintain her policy of neutrality," Donke wrote in an email. "It's understood that supposedly neutral debate sponsors will not then turn into partisan pundits. Brown didn't want this debate to be a trap."
Domke said that the highly publicized back and forth over debates should have little effect on either candidate’s actual political chances.
"This early, voters don't care about debates," Domke wrote. "Voters are savvy about understanding that politicians are political, that they'll try to negotiate debates to their advantage, and avoid debates that could be rigged."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-one mice died of dehydration in a Harvard University laboratory this past spring, prompting the federal government to cite Harvard for violating the American Animal Welfare Act.
On April 14, laboratory personnel found the mice dead in their cages, and then noticed that the system that provided water to the mice had malfunctioned, leaving the 41 mice with insufficient water to survive.
Subsequently, the facility reported the incident to the United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Animal Welfare Act. In response, the USDA inspected the location on April 24 and filed a report citing the facility for the death of 11 adult deer mice and 30 newborn deer mice. Deer mice, unlike some other types of mice, are subject to the regulations imposed by the Animal Welfare Act.
Prior to the USDA’s inspection, the facility had made changes to the procedures for monitoring the cages, had retrained staff, and had started working on obtaining a new watering system, according to a statement from Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal.
Neal declined to comment on which facility the incident occurred in, how long the mice were without water, and what additional training the staff went through as a result of the incident.
Alka Chandna, a research associate for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said that she was “terribly disturbed by the extreme pain and distress that was endured by the 41 mice,” though that she was “not surprised to learn that these violations occurred.”
Chandna also questioned the care with which researchers were monitoring the mice. “If mice don’t receive water, they don’t die overnight. It’s a process of a few days,” she said.
According to Chandna, these types of violations rarely lead to fines or penalties
“We certainly hope that citations lead to better behavior, but it has not been our experience that that’s what happens,” she said.
USDA spokesman Dave Sacks said in an email that the inspection has not been completed, and consequently he did not yet know what penalties Harvard would suffer as a result of the incident.  He noted that the possible penalties for violations of the Animal Welfare Act range from a official warning letter, which carries no fine, to maximum $10,000 fine per violation.
“[R]est assured that the USDA will fully enforce the Animal Welfare Act,” he said in an email. “Ensuring the welfare of the animals we regulate under the Animal Welfare Act is at the heart of everything we do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From a pool of 1,448 applicants, 15 students were admitted to Harvard College in the 2012 transfer admissions cycle, putting the acceptance rate for students who start their time at Harvard as sophomores or juniors at approximately 1 percent.
 
“The admits are a fantastic group,” said Christine Gibbons Mascolo, the director of transfer admissions. “We think that they can really add to the [Houses] and College as a whole, even in small numbers.” 
 
 The applicant pool shrunk slightly from last year’s admissions cycle, when 1,488 students sought to transfer to Harvard. Fifteen students were accepted last year as well.
Mascolo said that the College, still within memory of its two-year moratorium on all transfer admissions, will probably accept a similarly tiny number of transfer students again next year.
“It’s done by a committee and we’re looking for the same kinds of excellence. I don’t expect any changes right now,” Mascolo said.
She added that the transfer admissions process mirrors the process for freshmen admissions, though with a much smaller applicant pool. This year, 5.9 percent of the 34,302 freshman hopefuls were accepted.
 
 Rishi Goel ’15, an admitted transfer student from the University of Texas at Austin, said he was in disbelief when he first read his acceptance email. 
 
 “I couldn’t even call my parents because it was too surreal,” Goel said.
Goel said that he was attracted to Harvard because of its biomedical engineering degree as well as its liberal arts curriculum. But he is also looking forward to the New England environment.
 
 “The cold weather is going to be such a relief from the Texas heat, and I cannot wait to get rid of my cedar fever,” he said of an allergy that plagues many central Texas residents but is nearly unheard of in Cambridge.

It's 1:30 in the morning, and you're hungry. But where do you go? It is a divisive debate among the Harvard student body, and loyalties to the Square's late-night stops run deep. Over the next 11 days, The Crimson will debate 11 popular choices around campus. First up: The Kong.
I first visited the Kong during my pre-frosh weekend in the spring of 2009. And it has been a steamy, delicious love affair ever since.
 
Hong Kong Restaurant is simply the best. The Alpha and the Omega of late night food. As a wise man once said, “There’s no telling how a good night will end. But great nights end at the Kong.”
 
Those of you who know me understand the intense passion that I have for the Kong. I could write a short novel on the topic, but I am forced to condense it into a blog post. Let me explain to you why the Kong is more than a restaurant—it is a home, a palace of Chinese greatness, Harvard’s capital of good times.
 
First of all, I am convinced that whoever designed the restaurant is part-Willy Wonka, part-wizard architect. You can roll into the Kong with a group of 10, and the place can be absolutely packed. If you’re lucky, there’s a table for two hidden in the back. And yet somehow it never takes more than five minutes to be seated. Yes, the table you’re at may only have four chairs, but the group of 10 is somehow all sitting comfortably.
 
And even when you’re doing that waiting, it’s all inside in the friendly confines of 1238 Mass. Ave. I’ve never not waited outside to get Pinocchio’s after 11:30 p.m. Even Felipe’s, perhaps the third leg of the late-night trifecta, is known to occasionally force its patrons to wait outside. Never at the Kong.
 
The food? Spectacular. I myself am a man of the C-19 persuasion (pork fried rice, three crab rangoons, and four chicken fingers), though I have been known to stray on occasion and experiment with scallion pancakes (“scal pals,” as a buddy of mine affectionately calls them) and beef chow foon. While I rarely venture onto the other pages of the Kong’s extensive menu, I have never once been dissatisfied with my meal.
 
And the Scorpion Bowl? That almost clinches the best late-night restaurant title right there.
 
The Kong, more than anything else, values loyalty and friendship. As a regular patron, I am often greeted with a hearty “Hello” or “Hi, Ben, great to see you again!” The waiters are both friendly and bro-huggable and it meaningfully adds to my regular Kong experiences. And I am convinced that it is the best place to run into people outside of Annenberg.
 
It is indeed a beautiful thing, and at 1:47 a.m., an atmosphere you can’t recreate anyplace else.
