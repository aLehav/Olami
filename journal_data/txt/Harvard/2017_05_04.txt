After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
I write in response to “In Support of a Fair Unionization Election” to make clear that student voter eligibility requirements were determined jointly by the University and the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers (HGSU-UAW) before the November election on unionization.
Prior to that election, the University and the HGSU-UAW reached an election agreement that defined which students would be part of a bargaining unit and therefore eligible to vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maybe I’m too young to reach the same conclusion Hilton Als did after viewing Moonlight for the first time and before beginning his essay in the New Yorker with the words, “Did I ever imagine, during my anxious, closeted childhood, that I’d live long enough...?” but I did. I skipped a formal on Monday and slipped on the T to Davis. Then I watched a movie entitled Gook. I was stunned when it finished because I, too, had never thought I’d ever see this film. A couple of weeks ago I wrote that I had viewed Moonlight as an end because I could never imagine its yellow equivalent, a film based on “yellow beauty, precision, and rhythm.” Oh, but it’s no longer the end. It’s a beginning, and God, what a beginning we have.
Gook, like a fling, was shot in one summer. The lead actor/director/writer Justin Chon is the Asian kid from Twilight, and the other actor David So is every Asian kid’s favorite YouTube comedian. The premise is 1992 Los Angeles, the day of the Rodney King verdict, and the tragedy many Korean Americans call Sa-i-gu, which, to me, had always been the textbook story of multiracialism in the United States, the entry point of many young yellow Americans to our history if the railroad boys in Brinkley didn’t do it for you, since 1992 wasn’t that far away and 2200 Korean-owned shops were burned to the ground. In the film, two Korean American brothers Eli and Daniel own a women’s shoe shop, and often, an eleven-year-old black girl Camilla is seen helping out. The film circles a day but spans longer, as the viewer watches the city’s interethnic tensions, Rodney King trial, and shop-owner struggles as witnesses instead of consumers. The world, political moment, and generation the film touches are all important, yes. The actors are also important, because as YouTubers, they’d informed so many of my generation’s experiences, vernacular, and senses of Asian-ness. But mostly, it is a world in a yellow boy’s eyes, a world that our country very rarely has the privilege to enter through film, which is what stunned me.
Last week at the Kennedy School, I watched the new documentary LA92 detailing the riots in honor of their 25th anniversary, constructed completely of footage. Like many documentaries on the subject, it was gory and difficult and rough. It demonstrated black anger/grief, white ignorance/cruelty, and yellow fear/survivalism. In the documentary, a Korean woman spans her arms and legs against her shop window to (ineffectively) prevent looting, stating over and over again broken, “This is America,” while a Hispanic man tells her, not so nicely, to go back to her country. Korean radios played in the background while iconic shots of Asian/Korean store owners circling their rooftops with rifles flashed continuously on the screen. But I still felt the documentary, like every other source on the riots, never reached the Korean perspective’s interiority. It kept depicting our community as fearful, as broken, as unsympathetic, when it couldn’t have been that simple, because some of the guys circling the roof were, like me, American-born teenagers, and therefore, more fluent in the country’s racial politic. Furthermore, I trusted we were more complicated. As the only Asian American in the room during the screening, I felt compelled to comment on this frustration, so I did. The panelists offered some resources to consider while one stated that the documentary wasn’t going to do the unpacking for me. After the screening, a white girl in the audience went up to me and told me that there was this organization called Saigu (yes, two syllables) that was doing some good work and I should check it out, as if I wasn’t the Asian girl and she wasn’t the white girl in the situation. I nodded, waxed like she was enlightening, and got out. Maybe to me, eleven minutes, pictures, or mission statements didn’t constitute a story, let alone, an interiority. I’d expected too much of a documentary, to really have a voice. But in every telling of this story, even some as Asian-focused as Helen Zia’s, the Asian perspective is brushed off as uncomplicated and undeserving of screen time, consideration, or even answers.
But Gook is so intimate the interiority is your own. In the beginning of the film, Eli gets some shoe supply in a giant cardboard box. When he can’t stuff it in his car in time for these Hispanic boys to not see him, they slug him against a fence until he falls down, easy, but when they leave, he gets back up with no problem, because even if he’s lost his pride, he hasn’t lost his shoes. When taggers paint the word GOOK on the hood of his car and a penis on its tip-top, he pretends he doesn’t see it and tells Camilla to get in, drives it around like it’s nothing. Kamilla tells him the neighbors think that both he and his brother are gay because they own a woman’s shoe store, and, in addition, Eli has bangs, a point which for the brothers, is one of comic relief. When Daniel shows Eli his mixtape without telling him he’s singing, then begrudgingly admits it, Eli laughs, chorusing “You’re trying to be an R&B singer?” between breaths, while Daniel laughs too, says “But you heard the dogs,” referring to the evidence he was ripped off by his black producer, admitting that his dream is an impossibility. Then Eli asks Daniel what he can teach anyone about love. I surprised myself because, like the brothers, the expectation of getting cheated, the dependence on kin, the beating down of pride were so familiar, so unfazing, I hadn’t noticed how messed up it was until I saw the characters on screen laughing to each situation in response. Above tragedy, I recognized simplicity. There is no romance in this film. Their love, like the love I grew up on, was simple: for family, as survival, in case, which may be the real tragedy. To have love so narrow it loses language.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
She didn’t complain. She sat still on the brown varnished chair as if nothing of significance was occurring. But I could sense her pain: her gag reflex was activated (an instinctive physiological response that prevents choking) and tears were assembled on her lower eyelid, ready to roll down her chapped cheeks. But she held those tears back.
She was a young woman in her early thirties. She had presented herself at the outpatient clinic where I was completing my surgery clerkship to get her tonsils checked. Now, she was put on full display, like a rare artifact at a history museum, so that her malady could instruct us, a group of young medical students. She was suffering from tonsil cancer, a remnant of her struggle with depression and homelessness, which she had attempted to quench through heavy drinking and smoking.
“I am alright,” she kept repeating reassuringly to the attending physician who was examining her.
“Was she lying?” I kept wondering. She was in obvious pain: the metal tongue depressor—cold and laced with alcohol—revealed the large inflamed tonsils. Normally, these almond-shaped structures are docile, but right now these ‘guardians’ of the oropharyngeal tract had declared mutiny against the body they were supposed to protect.
Flustered, I kept thinking of reasons that could explain this young woman’s silence. Perhaps she was scared and thought if she objected, the attending physician might not look after her illness properly. Perhaps she was just shy, and couldn’t articulate how she truly felt. Or, perhaps, it was something more practical, more tangible: She was at a free clinic. After all, she was being seen without having to worry about the initial medical expenses; she was beholden.
In the absence of a supportive physician, it is not uncommon for the patient in such cases to start blaming themselves and believe that their lifestyle choices have denied them the ability to claim their right to fair,  compassionate treatment and respect. Rights, they believe, are something that only “regular” people could claim. People with perfect lives running on a perfect schedule, people who have a family, people with houses guarded by perfectly white picket fences.
In exchange for her time, however, we were learning clinical skills that would one day save many more lives. Her poverty was paying for our development.
Although it has been a few years, that image of vulnerability has never really left my mind, and I constantly struggle over what recourse could be made available for people like her. Soon, I will change places with the attending physician and become the one that instructs medical students in their formative years. I am confident as a doctor, but I wonder if I can teach empathy to my future students.
For in our pursuit of excellence in medical care, have we abandoned the most vulnerable?
Medical education and practice around the world are guided by the principles of bioethics. The most important of these is the principle of nonmaleficence, derived from an aphorism used by Greek physicians: “primum non nocere”. It translates to “first, do no harm.” But there is an urgent need to reform the current medical curricula with the understanding that a negative, pacifist conception of being a doctor is not enough.
Medical students must understand how to approach vulnerable populations: the homeless, ethnic minorities, women who have suffered abuse, and more. Instead of focusing solely on the passive goal of doing no harm, we need to focus on developing empathy in medical training—empathy that goes beyond mere collection of clinical information. It can start with training budding physicians on how to initiate and sustain a meaningful conversation with a patient and how to listen when a patient does open up. Students should also be provided some time to reflect—and preferably document—their interactions with patients. These interactions, if recorded properly, will be of immense value in the development of students’ clinical acumen and should furnish them with a space for introspection in the midst of fast-paced clinical rotations.
As the young woman was leaving the room, she wished us, with a broad smile, “good luck for the exams.” Even though she was in pain because of us, she was poised, gracefully handling the situation, beaming in the face of her critical condition. I did not understand why she went through this ordeal and I probably never will. Maybe contrary to her judgment, she was indeed better—better than most regular people.
She was my first lesson in empathy, a lesson that taught me much more about what it meant to be a doctor than any of the library’s thick, hardbound books on medical ethics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard filed an appeal with the National Labor Relations Board Wednesday to contest a ruling that recommended the University conduct an additional student unionization election.
On April 19, Thomas A. Miller, a hearing officer who oversaw a weeks-long hearing between the two parties, ruled that Harvard had “not substantially complied with the voter list requirements” in the November student unionization election. He recommended that Harvard hold a new vote if the current election does not end in favor of Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers.
NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr. will review Miller’s recommendation and Harvard's appeal make his own ruling. After Walsh releases his decision, either side could appeal to the NLRB in Washington, D.C. for a final ruling.
In its appeal, lawyers representing Harvard argue that the NLRB should “reject the findings and recommendation of an NLRB Hearing Officer and accept the outcome of the November 2016 election,” according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven.
“The University believes that these facts do not warrant a new election,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
In its appeal, Harvard argued that the results should stand because there was a high voter turnout and students were informed about the election.
“Questions about the list of eligible voters—the basis for the [HGSU-UAW] claim for a new election—ignore the facts,” Cowenhoven wrote. “Students were highly engaged, and after nearly two years of organizing on campus by the HGSU-UAW, thousands voted in the November 2016 election—a majority in opposition to unionization.”
Union organizers criticized Harvard’s decision to file an appeal.
“We’re disappointed with the administration but unsurprised,” Andrew B. Donnelly, a graduate student and union organizer, wrote in an emailed statement. “Harvard, in an effort to drag this process on and deny the eligibility of its student workers, has taken exception to nearly all of the hearing officer’s recommendations. We’re confident that the Regional Director will reject this appeal.”
Results of the current election depend on the remaining uncounted challenged ballots, or ballots from voters whose eligibility is disputed. Of the challenge ballots counted so far, 185 more votes oppose unionization than support it.
In his ruling, Miller also recommended that the two parties count 195 of the challenged ballots and disregard the rest.
Harvard’s appeal is the latest development in a student unionization election that has lasted months. After the election was declared too close to call, both Harvard and the unionization effort filed objections. The parties gathered at a weeks-long hearing earlier this year to debate the eligibility of challenged ballots and present evidence for their respective objections.

SORRENTO SQUARE—Overcoming subpar pizza, dishonest officiating, and clumsy attempts at cheating, The Harvard Crimson topped the Harvard Lampoon 23-2 in a no-holds-barred pizza eating competition Wednesday afternoon.
Corporate shills at the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally published a so-called humor magazine organized the event—a thinly-veiled promotion for a local business that occasionally produces so-called pizza—which took place in front of the dilapidated steps of the Lampoon’s Sorrento Square building.
Anchored by heavyweight Jarele Soyinka ’19, The Crimson put away roughly 23 boxes of pizza in a heroic feat of athleticism and intestinal fortitude. Representatives of the Lampoon, despite flaunting the rules by substituting in a hungry local vagrant, only managed to consume a collective two slices.
Organizational inefficiencies plagued the event, which did not begin until 40 minutes after its scheduled start time. Lampoon staffer David P. Frankle ’18 appeared visibly impatient at the delay. When the pizzeria staff finally arrived with the surprisingly small and already-lukewarm pizza pies, Frankle smiled hungrily.
‘Poonsters distributed pens, t-shirts, and other corporate memorabilia from the pizzeria. Though pizzeria-affiliated referees incorrectly called the event for the ‘Poon, spectators and numerous reporters verified that The Crimson had, in fact, eaten more pizza.
The pizza-eating competition took the place of this year’s annual Crimson-Lampoon Softball game. The Crimson has won the last 141 contests and, at press time, analysts were already predicting a 23-2 Crimson victory next year.
