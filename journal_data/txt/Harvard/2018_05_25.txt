After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust conferred 1,533 bachelors of arts and bachelors of science degrees on members of the Class of 2018 in Harvard’s 367th Commencement exercises Thursday.
“By virtue of authority delegated to me, I confer on you the first degree in arts or in science and admit you into the fellowship of educated persons,” Faust said to a cheering crowd of black-robed graduates.
Faust—whose participation Thursday marked her last time presiding over Commencement, given she will step down in June 2018—awarded more than 8,000 total degrees to College seniors, students from Harvard’s graduate schools, and students from the Extension School in Tercentenary Theatre. Thousands of people flocked to Harvard Yard to attend the ceremony.
Faust also conferred seven honorary degrees at the morning exercises. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 introduced the honorees—including former University Provost Harvey V. Fineberg and Pulitzer Prize winning-poet Rita Dove, a professor of English at the University of Virginia.
The morning exercises opened with three speeches, one in Latin and two in English, all delivered by degree candidates in the Class of 2018.
In a speech entitled “Experientia Transfigurativa”—meaning “A Transfigurative Experience”—Latin orator Phoebe M. Lakin ’18 compared Harvard to the fictional wizarding school Hogwarts in J.K. Rowling’s famous Harry Potter series.
She said students’ “bodies” and “minds” have been transformed while at Harvard, arguing that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s oft-repeated assertion that attending the College is a “transformative experience” forms the equivalent of a “prophecy” in the Potter novels.
Christopher E. Egi ’18 delivered the senior English address, in which he recounted his parents’ “trek across the Atlantic” so Egi could pursue an education. He also spoke about the importance of using higher education to fight for those whose dreams have been “deferred [and] denied.”
Egi detailed his memory of the death of Michael Brown—a teenager fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014—and said the event served as a wake-up call.
“Just like me, Michael was black. Just like me, Michael was 18. Just like me, Michael was about to go to college,” Egi said.
Egi said Brown’s death inspired him to “encourage and enable those like Michael Brown whose dreams are deferred and denied.” Egi urged the graduating class of 2018 to “do well and to do good” after leaving Harvard.
Law School student Pete Davis, who delivered the graduate English address, urged graduates to resist “liquid modernity”—which he defined as the impulse to keep one’s options open rather than commit to a cause, community, or person—and instead pursue activism and advocate for justice.
He urged students to “rebel” and “join a counterculture of commitment.”
In between the speeches and the conferring of degrees, the Commencement Choir and the Harvard University Band entertained attendees with performances. A group of students also sang an acapella piece composed by Joshuah B. Campbell ’16 titled “Sing Out, March On.”
As Faust conferred degrees on each group of candidates across the University’s graduate and professional schools, some deans thanked her for her “service” to Harvard. Faust will soon hand over the the University’s reins to President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow, ending a more-than-decade-long turn at Harvard’s helm.
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said he is grateful to Faust.
“Madame President, we thank you for your years of service. We thank you for your wise leadership,” Daley said.
Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, a top contender in the recent presidential search for Faust’s successor, called Faust the “extraordinary Madame President.”
Before closing the morning exercises, Garber said no words could capture the gratitude Harvard affiliates feel for Faust’s leadership.
“Please join me in hoping that our applause will,” Garber said, prompting sustained clapping from the audience.
Faust was not the only departing University administrator who drew praise and applause during the morning exercises Thursday. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 complimented Dean of the Graduate School of Education James E. Ryan, who announced in Sept. 2017 that he will leave Harvard to serve as president of the University of Virginia at the end of this academic year. Garber wished Ryan well in his new job. Ryan will be succeeded by Ed School professor Bridget Terry Long.
As is traditional during Harvard Commencements, the ceremony opened with the sheriff of Middlesex County—clad in traditional attire and wielding a staff—calling the meeting to order.
At the end of morning exercises, the sheriff again mounted the stage and shouted the meeting was adjourned—an announcement that prompted perhaps the strongest applause of all from thousands of newly minted graduates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congressman and civil rights leader John R. Lewis told students and alumni they “must lead” and implored them to get into “good trouble, necessary trouble” during his Commencement address Thursday.
Lewis—who spoke during Afternoon Exercises, the Harvard Alumni Association meeting that comprises the second portion of Commencement Day programming—told students and alumni they are “never too young” and “never too old” to lead.
“Take a long deep breath, and take it all in,” Lewis said. “But tomorrow, I want you to roll up your sleeves. The world is waiting for talented men and women to lead it to a better place.”
Lewis, a decorated icon of civil rights in the United States, has represented Georgia’s 5th congressional district for over 30 years. He was one of the “Big Six” leaders who organized the March on Washington in 1963 and he helped lead the 1965 march across Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. Lewis was awarded an honorary doctorate of law degree from Harvard in 2012.
Lewis devoted much of his speech to what he characterized as America’s challenging political climate, urging students and alumni to “save our democracy.” Lewis urged the crowd to fight for social justice and to protect the planet from climate change. He exhorted the audience to bring about these changes through voting rather than violence.
“There are forces in America today and around the world trying to take us to another place. Our foremothers and our forefathers brought us to this place. Maybe our foremothers and our forefathers all came to this great land in different ships,” Lewis said. “We’re all in the same boat now and we must look out for each other.”
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.—another member of the “Big Six”—in 1968. Lewis, who worked with King, recalled the sadness and frustration he felt when he learned about his friend and fellow activist’s death. He advised audience members to focus on the “hope” of the future rather than the tragedies of the past.
“Today, we have to get rid of our tears and not be down,” he said. “We have to be hopeful and keep the faith and turn the ship of state around.”
Lewis drew praise from University President Drew G. Faust, who delivered her final Commencement address after his speech. Faust plans to depart her post in June after more than a decade in office; President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow will succeed her.
“There can be no finer example of how to live a life than that of John Lewis,” Faust said.
In her own speech, Faust said she has “hope” students can face the challenges of what she called a “damaged world.” Faust dwelled at length on the swelling anti-higher education sentiment in the public sphere, especially as it relates to Washington, D.C.
“At a time of growing distrust of institution and constant attacks on colleges and universities, I want to affirm my belief that they are beacons of hope. I think our best hope for the future to which we aspire,” Faust said. “At their very essence, universities are about hope and about the future and that is at the heart of what we celebrate today.”
Faust also reflected on her tenure, joking that she and the first iPhone were “launched” within 48 hours of each other in June 2007. Since then, Faust said, the University has faced many crises including the Great Recession, cases of sexual misconduct, and attacks on higher education with the dawn of the Trump era.
But Faust also applauded what she described as a burgeoning culture of student activism, mentioning movements like Black Lives Matter, Divest Harvard, #MeToo, and the activism of undocumented students on campus.
Faust said the “privilege” of interacting with Harvard’s faculty, students, and staff has “uplifted” her throughout the past decade.
Before Faust’s speech, outgoing HAA President Susan Morris Novick ’85—in a surprise move—awarded Faust the Harvard Medal, a prize recognizing extraordinary service to the University. Though the HAA had announced three other winners of the prize ahead of Thursday’s meeting, Novick told the audience in the middle of the ceremony that she planned to give an additional award to Faust.
Novick called Faust a “pioneering president” and a “global ambassador for higher education.” Novick also praised the outgoing president for her efforts to make Harvard a “more inclusive” campus and lead the University “through change and storm.”
In her speech, after hearing Novick’s praise, Faust emphasized Harvard’s “work is unfinished.”
“The job remains still to be done. And time have made that more difficult than ever,” Faust said. “May we continue to challenge ourselves with the hope of all we can be and the unwavering determination to be that. May Harvard be as wise as it is smart, as restless as it is proud, as bold as it is thoughtful, as new as it is old, as good as it is great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President of the Harvard Alumni Association Susan Morris Novick ’85 announced the election of six members of the Board of Overseers and six directors to the board of the Harvard Alumni Association during the Afternoon Exercises of the 367th Commencement Thursday.
Members of the Board of Overseers—the University’s second-highest governing body—are tasked with weighing in on the direction of the University, advising top Harvard administrators, and approving certain actions by the the Harvard Corporation, Harvard’s top governing body. Its members serve for six-year terms, and Harvard degree holders vote every spring to elect five new members.
The HAA board of directors serves as an advisory body meant to connect alumni around the globe by developing volunteer leadership and bolstering graduates’ engagement.
The announcement comes after both the Overseers and HAA announced new leadership. Margaret M. Wang ’09 will succeed Novick as the president of HAA. Susan L. Carney ’73 will replace Scott A. Abell ’72 as the Overseers president while Gwill E. York ’79 will succeed Tracy P. Palandjian ’93 as the vice chair.
The new Overseers are Geraldine Acuna-Sunshine ’92, Philip Hart Cullom, Meredith “Max” Hodges ’03, Marilyn Holifield, Diego A. Rodriguez, and Yvette Roubideaux ’85, per Novick’s announcement.
Five of the six newly elected Overseers—everyone except Rodriguez—will serve the regular six-year terms, Novick announced. Rodriguez, who garnered the sixth-most votes, will serve the two years that remain on the term of former Overseer Jane Lubchenco, who stepped down due to work obligations.
The new HAA directors—each elected for three-year terms—are Collette Creppell ’82, Sid Espinosa, Natosha Reid Rice ’93, Krishnan Namboodiri Subrahmanian ’03, Bella T. Wong ’82, and Rashid Muhammed Yasin ’12.
The new Overseers were chosen from a slate of eight candidates nominated by an HAA committee. Harvard degree holders cast 26,765 ballots in the election. Similarly, the HAA directors were selected from a slate of nine candidates nominated by an HAA committee. Harvard degree holders cast 27,537 ballots in the election.
These elections mark the last announcement of expected turnover on Harvard’s governing bodies. The Corporation named its newest members Wednesday: Penny S. Pritzker ’81 and Carolyn A. “Biddy” Martin. The additions established gender parity on the University’s highest governing body, though it remains mostly white.
