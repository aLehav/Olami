After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty Deans are back in the news. Three years after Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson were pushed out of Winthrop over allegations of fostering a toxic house culture, their counterparts at Leverett have stepped down amid similar circumstances.
It was clear from early in Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras’ term that they were destructive to house culture. From the removal of common spaces and beloved community nights to alleged incidents of screaming at students, the ex-Leverett Faculty Deans actively detracted from the positive culture that other Harvard houses typically boast.
The houses, which form a unique facet of the undergraduate residential experience, are where Harvard students most deservedly expect the comfort of a home; they are also reflective of the College’s unusually decentralized approach to higher education, which places greater emphasis on house faculty. As Farrell and Ferreras have reminded us, the relative autonomy with which faculty deans rule their fiefdoms carries risks.
For Leverett residents in the Class of 2022, the toxic culture fostered under the ex-faculty deans was their only exposure to the house. This should serve as a reminder of the stakes of getting house culture right: Choosing a bad faculty dean, even for a couple years, can mar the entire Harvard experience of a hundred odd students. Such is the cost of concentrating power in the hands of individual faculty deans.
But there are benefits to that autonomy, too — benefits to freeing deans from the overbearing bureaucracy of the central administration. Harvard’s houses are the jewel in the crown of our insistent idiosyncrasy. We take pride in our houses — latching on to their traditions, sporting their merchandise, hoping to take comfort in the communities they foster. The larger institution is made more approachable and connected as a result of our membership in these bite-size communities. In this way, each house’s distinct culture also provides an avenue for students to take greater ownership of their school identity.
Harvard has, to its credit, put considerable effort into the difficult problem of balancing autonomy and oversight in the House system. The process of hiring new faculty deans is intensive in its effort to "match…energies" of dean and House. First-year and five-year reviews keep an eye on faculty deans and, to some degree, actually do their job: the Leverett Deans resigned under pressure just a few months after the start of their first five-year review. Nevertheless, this unhappy incident presents lessons to be learned and reforms to be made.
At a high level, the College should be clearer about the ultimate responsibility of faculty deans: not just making the trains run on time, but supporting students and fostering a community that is happy, comfortable, and nourishing for its members.
Once this goal is articulated, it becomes obvious that student input must carry greater weight in the selection process. If the central job of a faculty dean is supporting students, then shouldn’t our voices be of utmost importance to those evaluating candidates? Ultimately, it was student and tutor outcry that brought the shortcomings of Leverett’s deans to light. Prioritizing the perspectives of those groups during the selection process might have forestalled four years of bad leadership.
If the College makes clearer the basic selection criteria for faculty deans and better utilizes student input in finding candidates who meet them, crises of confidence in our house leadership will become far less common.
This will free us to focus not just on avoiding disaster but on harnessing the extraordinary potential of faculty deans to actively improve campus life. To not only maintain traditions but build new ones. To not only do no harm but intentionally do good. To ensure that house life keeps its pride of place in the undergraduate experience and allow us, joyfully and unambiguously, to call the many houses of Harvard home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the New York Times editorialized that “America Has a Free Speech Problem,” I knew they were right.
I see it all around me — friends confide in me that they feel like voicing their true opinions in this very newspaper could dash their dreams of admission to medical school. Others feel punished and ostracized for expressing their actual views. In one recent thread on the anonymous social media app Sidechat, students puzzled over which student government leaders are conservative, with one student inquiring “like who?,” as if conservative beliefs are worthy of shame. Another student wrote “when they believe that I shouldn’t have control over my own body, I don’t care to learn about their other beliefs,” implying that a student’s pro-life stance rendered them unworthy of discourse.
Beyond Harvard too, an icy atmosphere has descended across the nation, one where political discourse is inhibited. According to a New York Times and Siena College Research Institute poll, a majority of Americans say they have previously held their tongue for a fear of retaliation; only 34 percent of respondents believed Americans have complete freedom of speech. The pattern continues at colleges: Over 80 percent of college students report self-censoring some of the time, while 21 percent do so often. Pew has also documented that a growing number of Americans are acquainted with cancel culture — the term used to describe the practice of calling out individuals whose views are deemed offensive — and are becoming increasingly wary about its use.
There is less polling regarding discourse on Harvard’s campus specifically, but it likely faces the same problems that Americans and college students face nationally. College Pulse, a firm that conducts research about college campuses, ranks Harvard in 130th place out of 154 colleges for its freedom of speech. Although Harvard officially endorses free speech, the makeup of this institution, with fewer than 2 percent of our faculty and only nine percent of the class of 2025 identifying as conservative, suggests that any type of open dialogue is unbalanced at best. Although how much prominence conservative views should enjoy on campus — whether campus opinion should be representative of the country, the College’s applicant pool, or some other population — is debatable, conservative students should not be such a rare minority, nor should they be shunned for their beliefs.
When speech is policed, echo chambers arise, and the pursuit of truth becomes more difficult. In a free marketplace of ideas, where any belief can be heard, debated openly on its merits, and assessed rigorously, individuals can filter out truth from fiction and evaluate the strengths and shortcomings of various ideas. However, in echo chambers, individuals hear one set of ideas continually without dissenting viewpoints, and discovering the weaknesses of one’s own beliefs becomes much more challenging. Without having to defend their own ideologies, people become complacent with holes in their thinking and are not motivated to reconsider their principles. While a fine line exists between hateful rhetoric — which is never constructive — and controversial speech, erring on the side of tolerating discourse is wise because the dangers of ideological conformity are so great.
This lack of political discourse is not an issue unique to the left, but a facet of a larger American problem: People on both sides of the political spectrum have ceased talking to each other. While cancel culture buttresses echo chambers in progressive circles, echo chambers have simultaneously cropped up on the political right. Misinformation swirling in online chatrooms has convinced a whopping 75 percent of former President Donald J. Trump’s supporters that Trump won the 2020 election, despite a dearth of evidence to substantiate their claim. Many Republican politicians who have pushed back against this narrative are losing influence in their party, including Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost her primary challenge after co-leading the congressional investigation into the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The effect of both rightwing and leftwing echo chambers is the same: Viewpoints that deviate from the norm are silenced.
Echo chambers differ significantly on the right and left, but their mutual existence ensures that individuals are unlikely to interact with people of opposing viewpoints. Marriages between Democrats and Republicans are becoming less frequent and most Democrats and Republicans report having a core social network comprised exclusively of members of the same party. No wonder Americans rank political polarization as a top problem facing the country.
Yet polarization is far from the only hazard of today’s echo chambers — they also impede truth finding. Throughout history, echo chambers have successfully stifled progress: The Church censored Galileo’s findings, delaying societal acceptance of a heliocentric conception of our solar system. More recently, the USSR censored books critical of their regime, masking the dystopian nature of their government. In each society, countervailing viewpoints were suppressed, allowing status quo orthodoxies to flourish unquestioned.
While today’s echo chambers are not enforced by a central power like the Church or Soviet government, they are still maintained by each of us. Although the Internet provides individuals access to almost any idea conceivable, rarely do people seek out new perspectives.
Dismantling today’s echo chambers is no easy task. They are enforced by people’s aversion to new ideas and by social media platforms, many of which use algorithms that promote ideological homogeneity. Yet here at Harvard, in our own progressive milieu, there are small steps we can each take towards breaking our liberal echo chamber.
Listen to your conservative peers, don’t just shut them down. Take classes with professors that challenge your beliefs. Read widely.
This won’t solve the larger national problem, but it is a step in the right direction. Next time you walk through Dexter Gate, take its inscription to heart: “Enter to Grow in Wisdom.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Houghton Library opened on Tuesday an exhibition on the history of drag in America, organized by Matthew Wittmann, curator of the Harvard Theatre Collection.
The exhibit highlights the long history of drag as a part of American culture and points to its roots in Shakespearean England, where male actors frequently cross-dressed in theatrical performances.
“There's a longer history and a greater range of gender expressions,” Wittmann said. “People were doing these sorts of things for a long, long time.”
“Cross-dressing in the theater has existed for forever,” he added.
The display utilizes posters, photographs, and newspaper clippings to tell the story of American drag through the decades. These artifacts showcase several drag queens and include posters from a Hasty Pudding drag performance, offering a local viewpoint on American drag through the twentieth century.
Wittmann said he chose to center the exhibit around American drag primarily because Harvard students and faculty had demonstrated enthusiasm in related topics.
“The driving force here was scholarly student and faculty interest in gender and performance,” said Wittmann. “One of the clearest ways that is played with and popularized in contemporary American culture is through drag performance.”
The exhibit demonstrates the link between drag and the American prohibition in the early twentieth century.
“Drag performances really flourished because of prohibition,” Wittmann said. “These underground clubs that spring up — they are more receptive to different kinds of entertainment than previously-existing clubs, and so you see a greater range of types of entertainers.”
The exhibit also spotlights activists, such as Marsha P. Johnson, who were involved in the Stonewall riots.
But he acknowledged in an interview that drag “is not without controversy” and can sometimes be viewed as “an act of appropriation.”
“Often in performing an exaggerated version of gender, you can reinforce gender binaries,” Wittmann said. “A lot of this is in flux, and it depends on context and who the performer is and who the audience is.”
The exhibit also contrasts the stories and experiences of famous drag queens Sir Lady Java and Burma Taylor. Wittmann said the two had “very differential experiences” despite being near contemporaries due to the racial discrimination Sir Lady Java faced as a Black activist and performer.
Wittmann hopes visitors will gain an appreciation for the historical ties between gender and entertainment through the exhibit.
“What this really illuminates is how gender and entertainment intersect in different ways,” said Wittmann.
Houghton Library will host three guided tours of the exhibit in late September, mid-November, and early December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge’s new city manager, Yi-An Huang ’05, pledged transparency and collaboration with the City Council during a Tuesday interview with The Crimson.
Huang, previously the executive director of clinical operations at Boston Medical Center, said he will act with greater urgency on issues such as climate change, transit, and housing. He took office Tuesday morning virtually after testing positive for Covid-19.
Cambridge operates under a council-manager form of government, where the city manager handles daily governmental functions and prepares the nearly-billion-dollar city budget goals laid out by the democratically elected City Council.
The relationship between the city manager and the council has been a source of tension in years past, with some councilors saying the position holds too much power and the Council should have more sway in areas such as the budget process.
In November 2021, Cambridge residents voted to create an ad hoc committee to review and propose changes to the city’s Plan E Charter, which details the city’s form of government. The committee held its first meeting last month.
Huang recognized that disagreement and mismatched priorities between the council and the manager could be “challenging.”
“Over time, I think there was a lot of authority that got concentrated in the city manager,” Huang said.
He said he would increase transparency and try to “deepen that relationship and create greater alignment” with the council.
“There is room for us to be working through how we organize, how we get aligned, how we communicate, and that’s a conversation that we’ve already started having with city leaders and with councilors,” Huang said.
“I do feel like there’s a relationship that we can establish that will make this a really strong and working form of government,” he added.
Huang was appointed to the post by the City Council in June, following a monthslong search to replace former city manager Louis A. DePasquale. Owen O’Riordan, commissioner of the Department of Public Works, served as acting city manager over the summer.
Huang said he prepared to take office through conversations with O'Riordan, DePasquale, and former city manager Richard C. Rossi, who spent 45 years in Cambridge city government — the last three years of which he served as city manager.
“It is a history of people in the city who have been so dedicated and committed to making this a better place,” Huang said. “I feel very grateful for my predecessors.”
Huang said he hopes to be actively engaged with residents, including those who are typically less involved in city politics.
“My hope is that I’m also able to work to find voices that are not traditionally at City Hall and where we can incorporate those feelings,” Huang said.
Huang, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business School, said that he was inspired to pursue public service as a freshman undergraduate student after hearing a talk about the global HIV/AIDS pandemic from then-Harvard professor Jeffrey D. Sachs. He is the first Harvard College alumni to serve as city manager since the 1960s.
“That really drew me into the idea that we have so much ability to potentially make a difference in the world,” Huang said.
Huang connected his passion for service with his faith — something he said is closely tied to his identity.
“It’s a deep part of feeling like we are put here to serve especially those who are most vulnerable,” Huang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Department of Justice filed an amicus brief Wednesday stating Harvard may still be liable for allegations that Anthropology and African and African American Studies professor John L. Comaroff retaliated against students who warned others about his alleged sexual harassment.
Three Anthropology graduate students — Margaret G. Czerwienski, Lilia M. Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava — filed a federal lawsuit against the University in February for allegedly ignoring years of sexual harassment by Comaroff and filed an amended suit in May.
In count two of the amended suit, the plaintiffs allege Harvard violated Title IX “through its deliberate indifference to the retaliatory acts of its employees.” The plaintiffs state that Comaroff told Czerwienski and Mandava that they would have “trouble getting jobs” if they continued to tell others about his alleged behavior.
Over the summer, Harvard asked U.S. District Court Judge Judith G. Dein to dismiss counts one through nine of the suit. In particular, the University argues that count two should not hold Harvard liable for the retaliatory actions of any of its employees involved in the case.
The University also maintains in its motion that the alleged conduct described in the suit does not constitute retaliation.
“This Count should be dismissed because Plaintiffs do not allege that Harvard retaliated against them, but rather seek to hold Harvard strictly liable for the purported retaliation of Comaroff and others,” the University stated in the motion. “There is no such cause of action under Title IX.”
In the brief submitted by the DOJ on Wednesday, however, the department counters Harvard’s argument, claiming the University is not “immunized from liability for the retaliatory acts of its own faculty members” based on relevant case law.
The DOJ explained that an institution receiving federal funding is liable for the retaliatory actions of not just the institution itself but also of its own employees in two scenarios: when employees’ conduct “amounts to an official act or policy” by the institution or when the institution knowingly ignores retaliation perpetrated by employees.
“Under Title IX, students have the right to report sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, to their schools without fear of reprisal,” the brief stated. “For that to happen, schools must protect students who participate in the Title IX process from retaliation and respond effectively to known retaliatory acts of their employees.”
In response to the brief, Czerwienski, Kilburn, and Mandava wrote in an email that Harvard “failed to provide” protections against retaliation from Comaroff, preventing them from seeking recourse for sex discrimination at the school.
“We cannot exercise our Title IX rights without meaningful protections against retaliation,” they wrote. “This Amicus Brief by the DOJ reaffirms that retaliation against those who experience, report, and/or stand up against sex discrimination is an injustice, one Harvard and other schools are obligated to correct.”
University spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment. Comaroff did not respond immediately to a request for comment Wednesday evening.
Comaroff was placed on unpaid administrative leave in January after two Harvard investigations found that he violated the school’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
After being placed on leave for two years following allegations of sexual harassment, Comaroff returned to teaching this fall. At the start of his first class Tuesday afternoon, students walked out of his room in protest, and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers held a protest outside the Science Center.

The Harvard Management Company shored up its investments in the technology industry last quarter, boosting its shares of Alphabet — the parent company of Google — by nearly 40 percent while also increasing its holdings in the semiconductor companies.
At the end of June, HMC — the entity responsible for the University’s $53.2 billion endowment — held $263 million in Alphabet stock, representing the endowment’s largest direct investment and more than 30 percent of its $864 million public securities portfolio. HMC is required to disclose its direct public holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission each quarter because it manages more than $100 million in assets.
The endowment’s second largest stock holding is in Meta Platforms — formerly known as Facebook — though HMC liquidated eight percent of its shares in the tech giant during the second quarter. HMC now holds $183 million in Meta, down from $274 million at the end of March.
The University’s investment arm also bolstered its holdings in several semiconductor companies, including Intel, NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. ASML Holding, the only company HMC added to its public portfolio last quarter, also produces semiconductor chips.
The increased investments in semiconductor companies come as the federal government is pledging significant support for the industry, which it views as critical to national defense and technology sectors. Early last month, President Joe Biden signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which will provide over $50 billion for domestic semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development.
John M. Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School and the Chief Investment Officer of Beacon Trust, wrote that it is “probably not a coincidence” that HMC’s increased investments in semiconductor companies occurred as the federal bill made its way to Biden’s desk.
“It's clear that HMC’s managers are optimistic about the prospects for semiconductor manufacturers,” Longo wrote.
Consistent with previous quarters, the vast majority of HMC’s direct stock holdings lie in the technology, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries. The latest disclosure also marked the third consecutive quarter in which HMC did not invest in any exchange-traded funds, or ETFs — managed funds that offer exposure to many underlying securities.
The University has previously come under fire for its ETF holdings from campus activist groups such as the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, which alleged that the investments amounted to indirect support for the private prison industry. HMC liquidated all of its ETF holdings in the final quarter of 2021.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on the filings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Pakistani Students Association has taken to dining halls and public gathering areas in recent days to raise awareness and funds for flood victims in the wake of devastating natural disasters that have ravaged Pakistan.
The group’s efforts come as more than one-third of Pakistan is under water. More than 1,300 people have died and millions more have been displaced due to the flooding.
The HCPSA, founded in 2011, has been tabling at Harvard’s Smith Campus Center, placing flyers around campus, and asking other clubs to publicly support its efforts. But leaders of the group say their campaign has received insufficient support from Harvard administrators.
“Over the course of this entire fundraiser, we’ve heard nothing from the administration,” said Asmer Asrar Safi ’23-’24, a HCPSA board member. “It’s genuinely been disheartening, disillusioning on so many fronts.”
Members of the group asked nearly every set of Harvard faculty deans — who preside over the College’s 12 upperclassman houses — to support their efforts by personally sending out house-wide emails to raise awareness and funds.
The faculty deans of Eliot and Lowell House initially agreed to send the announcements over their houses’ email lists, Safi said. Faculty deans from seven other houses initially did not respond or declined the group’s request, Safi said, though they eventually replied to the HCPSA following a Crimson inquiry about the group's complaints. The faculty deans of Kirkland House and Leverett House had not replied to HCPSA as of Wednesday evening. The deans of Pforzheimer House, Anne Harrington and John Durant, declined to send the note but offered to assist in spreading awareness and suggested sending the announcement over the house's open email list.
The deans of Cabot, Dunster, and Currier House wrote in respective emails to The Crimson that they plan to support student efforts in the weeks ahead. The faculty deans of Quincy House were not contacted by the group.
Safi also called on Harvard’s top administrators to address the issue, saying it is a double standard for the school to publicly respond to the invasion of Ukraine, but not be more vocal about disasters affecting people of color internationally.
“There’s a double standard,” he said. “When there’s stuff happening in Ukraine or something that’s aligned with the West or Harvard’s interests, everyone’s on their feet, everyone’s campaigning, everyone’s fundraising, everyone’s holding talks.”
“These double standards exist in Harvard’s community,” he added. “Our people aren’t made to rot. That’s not what we want for our people, and that’s the idea that we’ve been given.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
Some other student groups have supported the HCPSA’s efforts. Shraddha Joshi ’24, co-director of Harvard Ghungroo, said members of her group have helped fundraise and raise awareness for the campaign with events and outreach.
“Ghungroo has the responsibility of forming a pan-South Asian space,” she said. “At times, it feels like, at Harvard, pan-South Asian solidarity or cohesion is sometimes missing.”
To date, the HCPSA has raised about $14,500, exceeding an initial goal, according to Safi. It will hold an event on Sept. 17 with the Harvard Advocate and Ghungroo.
“It’s countries like these, who don’t contribute to the climate disaster, that are affected the most,” said Aseelah Salman Ashraf ’24, c0-president of HCPSA. “It’s our responsibility and our prerogative to help.”
