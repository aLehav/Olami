After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rudy Giuliani’s comments suggesting that President Obama doesn’t love the United States have, at this point, become a media circus. I sympathize with NBC anchor Chuck Todd, who lamented that the story encapsulates “why Americans are learning how to hate politics and the media.”
Still, the former mayor’s remarks saw the resurrection of one rhetorical tendency on the right that needs to be put to rest swiftly. While denying that his comments were racist, Giuliani uttered the following non sequitur: “This isn’t racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism.”
The confused antecedent notwithstanding, Giuliani’s unfortunate turn of phrase is a startling reversion to a dormant meme of the Republican intellectual universe. As Philip Bump explains on The Washington Post’s website, the idea that President Obama’s defining political ideology is “anti-colonialism” comes from a book by conservative thinker Dinesh D’Souza. D’Souza argues that the President’s Kenyan father was under the sway of a leftist anti-colonial ideology, and that Obama continues to draw inspiration from that mode of thinking.
This bizarre description of the President’s philosophical motivation found advocates before and during the 2012 presidential election in former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Huckabee infamously picked up on D’Souza’s thread when he claimed that the President grew up in Kenya, saying on a talk show that such a childhood would produce a different “view of the Brits.”
The idea that having an “anti-colonial” President is a problem presents some prima facie issues for its exponents. As political science professor Laura Seay wrote several years ago for the Christian Science Monitor, the idea that colonial independence is a bad thing is puzzling coming from political figures whose country had to fight a colonial war of independence. All kinds of 18th century figures beloved of the modern right, from Washington and Jefferson to Adam Smith, were hardly fans of colonial empires as practiced in their time.
As Bump points out, however, the relationship of later anti-colonial movements in non-settlement colonies provides some support for the idea that anti-colonialism and American policy do not go together. He notes that famous third world leftists and sworn enemies of the United States like Che Guevara and Ho Chi Minh were among the most prominent anti-colonial leaders.
But these examples still do not explain the negative tone with which too many modern Republicans deal with anti-colonialism. The term encompasses many movements, not all of which were destined to align with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Most crucially, some of the United States’ knee jerk opposition to anti-colonialism may have been responsible for some of our most morally questionable foreign policy decisions.
One of these interventions came in the current Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1960s, just after its independence from Belgium. There, the United States’ tacit support for Belgian machinations and its hostility towards the new, anti-colonial government of Patrice Lumumba led to Lumumba’s fall, serious civil unrest, the rise of a brutal dictator, and the slow-moving collapse of the country. The worst part of this sorry tale is that Lumumba had, in fact, asked for U.S. support, which was not forthcoming because of our sympathies for European colonialism.
Ironically, Newt Gingrich should know something about this instance of pro-colonialism gone wrong: He wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on Belgian education policy in the Congo. But as Seay notes, this dissertation was sympathetic to the Belgian’s racist colonial education system, and does not appear to acknowledge that some form of “anti-colonialism” might be a legitimate reaction to living under such a regime.
Other foreign policy debacles from the Cold War should also be familiar to Gingrich. Perhaps the most astonishing of these missteps was the United States’ support for the government of apartheid South Africa and its allies in conflicts like the Angolan Civil War. Under the Reagan administration in particular, the U.S. even refused to support opposition groups like Nelson Mandela’s A.N.C., despite the pleas of activists like Desmond Tutu. When Congress did pass sanctions on South Africa in 1986, it did so over President Reagan’s veto. To the end, the Reagan administration feared that anti-colonial groups were simply too leftist to trust.
These experiences of Cold War policy in Africa seem to show that America has never suffered from a surfeit of anti-colonial sympathy in its foreign policy, and that it in fact needed more of that feeling at critical junctures.
So, the next time you hear Rudy Giuliani, or anyone else, claim that “anti-colonialism” is somehow “un-American,” remember two things: First, without a first wave of anti-colonialism, the United States might very well not exist, and second, a little more sympathy for later anti-colonialism may have gone a long way in helping the United States have a more effective foreign policy during the Cold War.
During his recent period of inexplicable statements, Mayor Giuliani accused the President of having “a dilettante’s knowledge of history.” Well, as the President might say: “Right back atcha, buddy!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I don’t say yes. I say oh, yes. I say yes, please. I paper his walls with my yeses. I come to with a boy on top of me. I am drunk, I am taking my shirt off. And I’m asking something over and over again: Do you think I’m pretty? Do you think I’m pretty? Do you think I’m, do you think I’m, do you think I’m—
I talk to a lot of people about sexuality. A lot of women, a lot of queers. Experiences like this come up again and again: Times when something feels bad, but we have a hard time saying what. When we feel disempowered. When there is a real, scary doubt about our “yes.”
The past fifty years of feminist activism have given us a language to politicize our experiences of violence: “Nonconsensual sex” becomes assault. That’s amazing. That’s revolutionary. That is a powerful critique of ideologies that lead us to systematically disrespect female and queer choice. Sometimes, however, we forget this more structural critique and talk about consent as an individual process—not asking “What kinds of power are operating in this situation?” but only “Did you or did you not say yes?”
Humans don’t exist in isolation, and it’s hard to make free choices in an unjust world. That doesn’t mean that marginalized people can’t consent. I’m very queer and very female, and as my roommates will tell you (the walls are thin), I’ve given some powerful yeses. But we need to think about consent not as the words two-or-more rational, free, horny agents exchange when they’re about to get down, but as a collective process of lowering barriers to empowered choice.
Let’s go back to that night to see what I mean. I’m a senior in high school visiting a friend. I am in deep, hormonal, emo love. She’s straight. She takes me to a party, where I have so much to drink my memory becomes dark water, brief flashes when I flicker up for air. I’m being kissed. There’s a boy, then another boy. I keep asking if I’m pretty. I keep saying yes.
In the morning I feel confused, hungover, memory fuzzy. I feel weird about what went down.
There’s a really obvious question here: Doesn’t it sound like I was too drunk to make an affirmative choice? I think the answer is yes. But I want to ask a different question, one more helpful in using this situation to think about how to have ethical sex: What systems of power produced such a fucked up experience?
Let’s think about the structure of the party, and what that tells us about ideological structures in our world.
The boys hosted the party, and they seemed to invite us with the expectation that something sexual would go down. There was plenty of alcohol to facilitate that. I’m not about to tell you to never have (respectful, negotiated) drunk sex. But we all know better than to touch someone who is incapacitated, or to use alcohol to coerce sex. Alcohol wasn’t the only form of “encouragement:” At one point early in the night, one of the boys literally bargained with me. “If you hook up with 'x,' I’ll let you hook up with my girlfriend,” he said. So to begin with, what went down reflected a culture in which sex is a goal to achieve by trading in other people’s bodies, whether through words or intoxicants. That mindset does not leave much space for meaningful consent.
The Corrupt Bargain of 2010 also evokes a whole host of assumptions about sexuality. The boy knew I had a crush on my female friend; he thought my bisexuality was hot, that his girlfriend was someone whose body he could offer, and that my desire for her meant I was particularly down to fuck. Ding ding ding, we’ve got a third: Stereotypes about queerness disempower us.
Finally, let’s think about the question I kept asking: Do you think I’m pretty? Saying yes to hooking up meant more than just hands on my breasts. It meant desirability. It meant acceptance. It meant getting out of my boring-ass town where nothing and no one went down and I was too nerdy and never pretty enough. We’ve been trained our whole lives to associate our worth with our sexualities, so saying yes to sex is often about a lot more than touch: It can determine feelings of value. So there’s an underlying cultural problem with how we associate sexuality and social worth.
Here’s the point. Feminists sometimes talk about “yes” and “no” like they’re uncomplicated. That’s a messaging thing, and it works: We want everyone who hooks up with anyone ever to do so only with an affirmative, active yes. Teaching that consent is always clear is a tool in making it so, by mandating explicit and affirmative articulation.
But ethical sex is hard. And it won’t stop being hard until we make cultures that enable meaningful choice, cultures wherein we minimize, as much as possible, power imbalances related to sex. That’s a tall order, but we’ve got to get there. For all the confused queer kids and weird mornings after. For all of us to feel safe and valued and of worth.
So we make complex decisions, and negotiate, and keep working at it, and don’t tolerate coercive bullshit, and do our absolute best. We take responsibility. We try our damnedest to create spaces in which our yeses can echo from the walls, wherein our yeses can motivate angry roommate keep-it-down-in-there texts, wherein “Am I pretty?” is replaced with “Am I responsive, am I respectful, am I kind?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III joked, “Harvard University will only close for an act of God, such as the end of the world.” Though never official policy, this quip has taken on a degree of truth. Over the past four decades, Harvard has cancelled classes just seven times due to snow. This semester’s three snow days, however, represent a clear break with the past. While the university’s safety-centered response to this year’s record-breaking snow was the right one in all respects, it has also revealed the need to develop policies to counter the academic challenges that snow days present.
As Boston saw 65 inches of snow and a declared statewide emergency over 30 days, Harvard properly prioritized the safety of students, faculty, and staff by cancelling non-critical operations. The University also took into account logistical concerns, such as public transportation closings. Though schools like Boston College in more suburban areas were able to open while the T remained closed, Harvard’s urban setting rendered that option impossible.  Furthermore, the processes behind the university’s decisions were sound. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours before each storm, a range of administrators held multiple conference calls to discuss the response.
That said, Harvard’s snow day policies still have some room for improvement in the realm of academics. Class cancellations have posed major challenges for students and faculty. Because professors often meticulously plan their syllabi, just one missed lecture during the 14-week semester can throw off a course plan. Both students and professors have felt this effect after each snow day produced a scramble to reschedule classes. Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde wrote in an email, “We’re a residential college and we’re running out of days to make up missed classes.”
In order to diminish similar academic challenges in the future, Harvard should take preemptive action. One key measure is equipping and encouraging professors to lecture over the Internet. Given the proper infrastructure, this would easily ensure that necessary material is covered. Additionally, the university should devise more comprehensive contingency plans to accommodate classes that need rescheduling so  that students and faculty have clear expectations.
Formulating these plans would not only keep courses on track, but would also reduce much of the immense academic pressure to keep classes scheduled in the face of inclement weather and thereby allow Harvard to focus even more on its commitment to the safety of its students, faculty, and staff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Prime Minister of Tunisia Mehdi Jomaa spoke at Harvard’s Institute of Politics Thursday about his country’s sometimes tumultuous but ultimately successful transition into a fledgling “start-up democracy.”
Jomaa described the political challenges the North African country has overcome since the start of the Tunisian Revolution, which lasted from mid-December 2010 to mid-January 2011, and the economic tests ahead.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, comes three weeks after the end of Jomaa’s term as interim head of state and a little more than a year after the ratification of Tunisia’s new constitution in 2014. Ellwood highlighted that Tunisia, though “fragile,” seems to be a “bright spot” in comparison with some of the less successful political situations that emerged out of the Arab Spring.
Jomaa said the Tunisian Revolution was driven largely by the desire of the country’s youth for more freedom and economic opportunities and owed its success at least in part to social media.
“The tool of the revolution was mainly Facebook since there was no freedom of expression in the media,” he said.
Jomaa added that the revolution’s rapid success in overturning the previous regime was “like a dream,” and that, though there were casualties, the country paid a “reduced price” for its freedom compared to some of the more violent revolutions of the past. But the quick overturn in government, according to Jomaa, did not by itself ameliorate or solve any of the underlying socioeconomic problems that had caused the revolution in the first place.
“The dream was that since we succeeded with the revolution, we will succeed quickly to solve other problems—but we forget that in a revolution we make the problems more complex,” he said.
One particular problem that the country faced in the wake of the revolution was a security crisis caused by the divide between its security staff—seen as the tool of the previous repressive regime—and its citizenry.
The new government eventually restored the confidence and the trust between those two groups, Jomaa said, using an “approach of dialogue” that was instrumental in preserving order and ensuring a legitimate transfer of power. Moreover, Jomaa said that this spirit of compromise must be preserved for the country to undergo the economic reforms needed to guarantee its continued success.
Jomaa called Tunisia a potential “hub for the future,” citing the country’s geography at the crossroads of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.
“I like to say that Tunisia is like a start-up,” Jomaa concluded. “It’s small today, it’s risky, but it has a big leverage...a leverage in democracy, a leverage of the peace [of the world].”

The Faculty Council voted Wednesday in support of the proposed concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media. The concentration will be brought to the full Faculty for discussion on March 3 and will be voted on at the meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on April 7, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
Undergraduates would be able to declare the concentration—which University officials first announced in October 2014—starting in December 2015. Five million dollars of seed funding provided by University President Drew G. Faust from her discretionary funds will help launch the concentration.
Harris also attended the meeting of the Faculty Council—the FAS’s highest elected body—to discuss proposals to change FAS class scheduling in light of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ move to Allston, according to Council members Stacey A. Combes and John T. Hamilton. Harris, along with Deputy Provost Peggy Newell, co-chairs a task force made up of students, faculty, and administrators deliberating on and crafting the proposals.
The meeting minutes stated that proposed changes aim to alleviate long-standing problems with class scheduling conflicts, highlight academics in undergraduate life, and address increased travel times to the Allston campus, according to Combes. Two-thirds of SEAS faculty are scheduled to move to new facilities in Allston in 2019.
Previous proposals recommended that the majority of FAS classes meet in 90-minute blocks twice a week, over four days. Sections and classes such as studios and seminars that require longer meeting times would take place on a fifth day.
Plans on scheduling, however, remain to be finalized.

UPDATED: February 27, 2015, at 2:33 a.m.
When the 47 members of the senior class concentrating in History and Literature arrive at the Barker Center to turn in their theses on Friday afternoon, they will be greeted by champagne and cookies in addition to the usual congratulations from their tutors and department heads.
History and Literature, which requires theses of all of its concentrators, has one of the earliest thesis deadlines of all the College departments. According to concentrators, the department also fosters a sense of camaraderie among students.
“History and Literature has a great community,” George G. Mills ’15 said. “You feel like everyone is really invested.”
Fellow concentrator Carrie J. Tian ’15, an inactive Crimson blog editor, said she has a make-up class scheduled at the time of the celebration but that she plans on missing at least part of her class tomorrow so that she can celebrate with her fellow concentrators.
Tian added that the concentrators will continue celebrating their achievements at an informal gathering after the champagne hour.
“The Hist. and Lit. seniors organized more of a normal party with no funding from History and Literature,” she said.
While other members of the Class of 2015 will finalize their theses throughout the upcoming weeks, History and Literature concentrators said they plan to take advantage of their newfound free time. Tian said she intends to “plan for senior spring.”
“I’m going to actually do my homework, because that hasn’t happened in the last few weeks," Andrea N. Del Conte ’15 said.
For his part, Mills said he hopes to spend the evening with his fellow concentrators.
“Hopefully I’ll be able to take a break here and enjoy it for a second,” he said, “then maybe head out to town with the other people in Hist. and Lit.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 27, 2015
An earlier version of this article misquoted Carrie J. Tian '15. In fact, she said she will plan for "senior spring" after completing her thesis, not senior "scream."

As temperatures remain below freezing and piles of dirty snow line campus pathways, some Harvard students have found their social and academic habits adversely affected while others have come up with creative ways to cope with the winter blues.
Freshman Joel I. Beazer ’18, originally from Antigua where temperatures hover around 75°F during this time of year, said that the colder temperatures have likely made him sleepier. He said that he is definitely more reluctant to leave his room for meetings or other social gatherings.
As a member of the Harvard University Cycling Association, Beazer noted that the club has been meeting less often. Instead of attending meetings he has recently tended to practice in his room, with a “cycling trainer” that allows him to simulate the experience of a bicycle without actually having to go outside in the snow, he added.
This lack of social activity and the consequent feelings of loneliness and sluggishness that it can cause are classified as the “winter doldrums,” according to Katherine A. Lapierre, chief of the Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services department. However, Lapierre said that the doldrums can be easily treated by simply “trying to stay socially engaged, even if you don’t feel like it.”
Beazer offered similar advice to fellow students suffering from the doldrums.
“It’s definitely tempting to just stay in…but it’s healthy to get out and meet people, talk to people, and just hang out,” he said.
Dining halls have allowed students to fulfill this need to socialize while remaining inside. Harvard University Dining Services staff members Kerry E. Maiato and John S. Martin said that, with the onset of winter, they have noticed an increase in the amount of time students spend in the dining halls.
“We all crave social contact,” said Jacqueline Olds, a Harvard professor of psychiatry, when asked about this increase in dining hall activity. She added that mealtime interaction with friends can actually be a good treatment for weather-related malaise.
While the doldrums are a minor, very treatable condition, there are more serious health issues that can arise from the winter weather. In particular, seasonal affective disorder, a form of depression, is linked to the reduction in bright light received during the darker parts of the year, according to Lapierre.
However, Lapierre added that, unlike other forms of depression which are typically treated with antidepressant medication, SAD can be relatively quickly addressed by increasing one’s exposure to bright light at the beginning of the day to help improve sleep cycles and focus levels.

Administrators earlier this semester updated Harvard’s centralized summer grant application system so that faculty members may submit student recommendation letters electronically, rather than in paper form, a change that was accompanied by some glitches.
As students apply for summer funding this spring, they will also see an updated user interface on the system, called the Centralized Application for Research and Travel, or CARAT. The changes have come with growing pains: some applicants encountered problems with the system when they sought funding earlier this month.
“The upgrade this year really streamlined the process so that the individual centers can really control much more of what the students see when they apply,” said Meg B. Swift, director of the Student Employment Office and the Harvard College Research Program.  “We hope the ease of having faculty go into CARAT and just upload letters for anybody they have been asked to write on behalf of simplifies” the process.
Despite its potential benefits, Swift acknowledged that some students ran into problems after the launch of the updated platform. Some information did not load properly on the site, even though it had been successfully tested before, she said, and some students failed to enter the platform. Eric J. Po ’17, for example, said he “got a lot more error pages” when trying to access CARAT this year.
“[Harvard University Information Technology] has been incredible throughout and has been responding to these [glitches],” Swift said. “There were issues over the course of the launch, which I think can happen in any launch.”
Even with the starting troubles, Swift said she thinks the updates will be worth it in the end.
According to Gregory A. Llacer, director of the College’s Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, CARAT is used for 123 awards across more than 60 funding departments, including the Office of Career Services. Officials from OCS received student complaints about the system when it rolled out; Po, who applied for summer funding from OCS for one of the Harvard Summer School programs, was among them.
“We had emails and visits from many students asking if their applications were all right,” OCS Director Robin Mount said. “But no one’s application was deeply affected.”
According to Llacer, as of Thursday, there were 4,823 users of CARAT, based on the number of discrete IP addresses used to enter the platform. Their platform has seen 19,497 sessions resulting in 113,106 page views and 2,837 applications submitted, according to Llacer.

Despite a series of heavy winter storms hitting the Boston area over the past few weeks, Junior Parents Weekend will proceed as planned, according to the the Office of Student Life. Parking availability is reduced due to the remaining snow, but weather forecasts predict a dry weekend and recent snowfall has been largely cleared from the Square.
“[W]e are in good shape, and are planning to move ahead with all of our events,” Jennifer H. Chapman, director of parent programs at the OSL, wrote in an email.
Many parents of the class of 2016 will come to campus this weekend to experience life at Harvard through a variety of scheduled programming.
The Junior Parents Weekend schedule lists programs ranging from sports games to faculty presentations, and many student organizations on campus are hosting events to welcome parents.
The weekend officially starts Friday morning at the welcome center in the Cambridge Queen’s Head, where parents can pick up their schedules, campus map, open class listings, and parent buttons, among other resources, from 8:45 a.m. to 5 p.m.
At 3 p.m., Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will give a welcome address at Sanders Theatre.
Parent buttons will allow families to enter many Harvard museums free of charge, including the Harvard Art Museums, Museum of Natural History, and the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology.
Student performances will also be occurring throughout the weekend, including Ghungroo 2015 in the Agassiz Theater and “Stranger” in the Loeb Drama Center.
Some student said their parents are not coming to campus for Junior Parents Weekend, while others expressed excitement for the weekend’s events.
Meena K. Boppana ’16 said she was excited for Ghungroo 2015 and glad that her parents would get to attend.
“It's nice that they schedule it during Junior Parents Weekend,” Boppana said.
In preparation to welcoming their parents to campus, some juniors were scrambling to clean up their dorms and ensure a presentable living space.
“My roommates and I did a whole cleaning sweep on our room today because it was foul,” Dorothy A. Atkinson ’16 said.
Atkinson joked that she and her roommates cleaned up the remnants of a pre-game “to make it look like we’re actually students here.” Atkinson added that she was looking forward to a junior parents tea hosted by her sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Max Everson has what hockey players call a “playoff mentality.”
The co-captain defenseman approaches the No. 16/15 Harvard men’s ice hockey team’s final regular season weekend—a home double against No. 10/9 Quinnipiac and Princeton with postseason implications—ready to win the tough battles and play every shift like it is his last.
Everson’s mindset is appropriate. After all, there is a chance he will play his last regular season minutes in a Crimson uniform on Saturday.
Along with goaltender Steve Michalek and injured defenseman Patrick McNally, Everson will greet Saturday’s Senior Night with some uncertainty.
Now fourth-year academic juniors, the trio withdrew from the College at the beginning of the 2012-2013 season, yet are listed as seniors in the team’s media guide. Following the end of this season, they will appeal to the Ivy League for the reinstatement of their lost year of eligibility.
In the meantime, Everson and Michalek plan to play Senior Night like it is their Senior Night.
“If we were to get that year back, we’d regroup and reset our sights on another year of college hockey,” Everson said on Wednesday. “But as of now, I’ve kind of just been playing like this is it for me—this is my last opportunity to go out there and try to help the team as much as possible, [and] try to be a leader for guys and make sure that we’re playing well heading into the playoffs.”
It will be another difficult weekend for McNally, who will have to watch his Senior Night from the stands. The Long Island native led all NCAA defenders in points per game before injuring his right leg at Cornell on Jan. 23. Since then, Everson and other Crimson blueliners have gamely shouldered increased responsibility, yet the team has failed to put together back-to-back wins in his absence.
McNally declines to rule out a return this season, and the timetable for his rehab remains uncertain.
“Probably the hardest part of being injured is watching the guys out there and not being able to play with them,” McNally said. “I don’t want to say that I’m going to be back or I’m not going to be back; I’m just trying to rehab and get…better, whether it be in this year or in the future.”
Between eligibility and injuries, there are many aspects of the Crimson’s future over which the team has no control. Nevertheless, Everson and company enter this weekend very much in control of their immediate postseason future.
Harvard (14-10-3, 10-7-3 ECAC) would clinch a top-four finish in the ECAC and a first-round conference tournament bye with two wins this weekend. With Quinnipiac and St. Lawrence having locked up the first two seeds last weekend, the Crimson will be battling Yale, Dartmouth, Cornell, and Colgate for the final two byes.
While Harvard could sneak into the top-four with fewer than four points this weekend, junior forward Jimmy Vesey considers both games must-wins.
“I think it’s very important at this time of year to kind of get in the mode of playoff hockey,” said Vesey, who leads the conference scoring race going into this weekend. “We’d just like to establish that we’re a very good hockey team and that we’re going to be a tough out in the playoffs.”
Sweeping Princeton (4-19-3, 2-16-2) and Quinnipiac (20-8-4, 15-2-3) would not be new for the Crimson, which beat the pair on the road on Dec. 5 and 6 to enter the exam break on a high.
Since then, however, things have changed. While the Tigers have continued to languish at the bottom of the standings, the Bobcats have not dropped a single conference contest since their 5-2 loss on home ice. Meanwhile, Quinnipiac coach Rand Pecknold and the five other USCHO.com voters who ranked Harvard No.1 that week have since changed their minds.
“We’ve had to deal with a little bit of adversity,” Everson said. “But I think that [weekend] gives us confidence going into this weekend, because as good as Quinnipiac has been, we all know that when we’re playing well and we’re playing our game, we can beat them.”
On Friday, the Bobcats will offer four deep scoring lines, headed by sophomore Sam Anas and captain Matthew Peca. Quinnipiac clinched the first seed in the conference tournament and a share of its second ECAC regular season championship with ties against Yale and Brown last weekend. A tie at Harvard would allow the Bobcats to clinch the Cleary Cup outright.
Princeton, meanwhile, has won only two conference games but has a habit of giving better teams fits. The Tigers nearly bested Harvard in their last meeting on the strength of a career-high 51 saves from sophomore goaltender Colton Phinney. Just two weeks ago, Princeton forced a 1-1 tie against St. Lawrence, the same team that routed the Crimson, 5-1, last Friday.
“We’re definitely not looking past Princeton,” Vesey said. “Both games are equally important.”
Everson considers this weekend a matter of execution—nothing more, nothing less. He is not worried about how many games he has left to lead his teammates, who have impressed him with their work ethic throughout the year. At the moment, he is focused on the job at hand.
“It’s a real privilege to work with this group of guys,” Everson said. “It’s a phenomenal group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A season filled with long trips, various records, and hours of hard work comes to fruition this weekend as the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams host the Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championships.
The women look to claim a three-peat while the men hope to take home the title after finishing third last year.
Doing so will involve having to compete against perennial Ancient Eight powerhouses such as Dartmouth, Cornell and Princeton. The Crimson believes it has what it takes to come out triumphant.
“Both teams are fired up for the competition,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It’s great to be on our home track and everyone is looking forward to the competition.”
The Crimson women head into the meet as defending champs and look to extend their recent dominance at Heps.
Though there might be some hesitation to tab the group as favorites after a loss to Princeton at HYP two weeks ago, the result served as a wake-up call for the team, who went through the same path two years ago en route to the first of its recent titles.
“The experience taught us that we needed to focus more,” captain Erika Veidis said. “The thing we drew from that meet is the other teams are really good…we can’t let up our game and we have to stay focused.”
Retaining the championship will require a team effort, with various athletes hoping to provide outstanding performances.
Senior Danielle Barbian leads the sprinters as she attempts to retain her individual title in the 60 meter dash, an event which has her name attached to it in the Ivy League record books. Fellow sprinter junior Autumne Franklin is going for her third straight 60 meter hurdle title.
In the distance portion of the field, Veidis faces tough competition from Princeton junior Cecilia Barowski as the Harvard runner aims to take home the 800 meter title after being runner-up by less than a second at the 2014 edition of the meet.
In the field component, sophomore and Ancient Eight record holder Nikki Okwelogu looks to claim her second-straight title in the shot put. She will be joined by senior weight thrower Taylor DuPont, who had a solid season with various top-five performances.
The men, meanwhile, will look to improve on their third place, 95-point performance from a year ago. The points mark was the highest for the Crimson men since 1985.
Harvard will have a challenge ahead of them as the men must replace points provided to them by then-seniors such as James Leakos ’14 and Maksim Korolev ’14. The former distance runners alone combined for 18 of the 95 points.
Though it might not be easy, Saretsky believes the team is capable of accomplishing it.
“I feel confident that we’ve got a group of guys that can match that point total,” Saretsky said. “The key…is focusing on what we can control.”
Captains Ben Glauser and Jarvis Harris will be among those expected to step up for the team, as the classmates have provided solid performances throughout the season in the weight throw and sprints, respectively.
Glauser will be joined in the weight throw by sophomore Joshua Whitener, as the two athletes took second and third in the event last year.
Harris will not be the only sprinter looking to make an impact, as rookies Malcolm Johnson and Ahmed Obed will look to provide points in their first Heps experience.
The distance component will be led by junior Tom Purnell, while seniors Will Geiken and Connor Reck look to contribute as well in their last Indoor Heps meet.
While certain individuals are tabbed for big performances, it will take a team effort from both newcomers and veterans in order to pull off the sweep and take home the title on both sides, a feat the team is confident on considering their success so far.
“The team has had good performances this year,” Veidis said. “In general, the team is pretty confident going in….We can definitely vie for the Ivy League Championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The penultimate weekend of Ivy League play is upon us, dear reader. The allure of spring break, shining like The Strip in the far distance, is obscured by the impending cloud of midterms and blocking group drama. Housing day teasers have begun to usurp trite Buzzfeed articles on the author’s ever-prescient Facebook Timeline. As muddy ice piles grow, the Brown school newspaper’s blog has debuted a “Lana del Foreplay” column to keep spirits high amongst yet another Derrick Rose injury.
Indeed, it can only be spring.
Last weekend brought some more clarity to the Ivy League title picture. The Gentleman’s C’s continued their up and down play; a week after losing to Dartmouth, Columbia swept Brown and Yale to knock the Elis a full game back of leader Harvard. Cornell looked dispirited in consecutive losses, with its offense dropping to 307th in Ken Pomeroy’s standings.
Harvard completed a four-game home sweep with a now-characteristic dismantling of Penn and comeback victory against Princeton. It was the fourth consecutive sweep of the artists formerly known as the Killer P’s; afterwards Harvard coach Tommy Amaker praised the grit of his squad, which has won eight straight games and controlled the entire second half on Saturday.
The race has shaped up much like this year’s football one, where an unexpected Elis loss put Harvard in first and set up a climactic late-season tilt for the title. Unlike in previous years, Yale hardly wet the bed (or, as it is wont, defecate in its laundry) in the big game. A week out, a similarly titanic tilt feels inevitable. Both teams cannot—and will not—look past weekend foes and top-four Ancient Eight squads Princeton (at Yale Friday) and Columbia (vs. Harvard Saturday).
Before moving on to the games, however, I’d like to take a moment to honor the seniors. While Harvard’s senior day is not until next week, this weekend will feature the final home contest for half the league’s eldest members. From All-Ivy talents like Cornell’s Shonn Miller to key rotation players like Columbia’s Steve Frankoski, Senior Day will be a rightful celebration of the sacrifices made and careers had by the league’s greatest talents.
Frankoski in particular is emblematic of the classic archetype that has shaped the Ancient Eight race all season—the gritty veteran role player doing his job. These set doesn' include senior Miller, Dartmouth's Gabas Maldunas, or Harvard's Wesley Saunders-each unquestionably one of their team's brightest stars and the focal point of nearly each offensive set.
On Columbia, it is Cory Ostekowski—a smart, instinctive center who made six clutch free throws in the victory against Yale. Cornell has Galal Cancer, a savvy guard with good range whose 17 points were instrumental in the squad’s win over Princeton, its best victory over the season. Penn’s Greg Louis is his team’s second best shooter, a reserve who ranks second on the team in rebounding.
Harvard’s Jonah Travis is the quintessential example of this stereotype. Sidelined at the beginning of the season with injuries, Travis has been the Crimson’s first big man off the bench during its eight-game run and its most savvy inside player. An expert in drawing contact at the rim, Travis uses excellent footwork and sneaky pump fakes to draw defenders in the air—going around them for easy layups or into them to draw fouls. The team rallies around him; if junior co-captain Siyani Chambers is its heart, Travis is its motor.
Travis, Ostekowski, Princeton’s Ben Hazel, and Yale’s Armani Cotton—forgive the trite saying—will not draw the headlines. Yet, all will feature heavily into how the league shakes out. Don’t sleep on these guys.
Without further delay, onto the games.
DARTMOUTH AT COLUMBIA
Save Chambers skipping Saturday’s game to appear on Chopped, the most surprising Ivy League athletics event of the week will be the introduction of new Columbia Lions football coach Al Bagnoli. After serving 23 years on the sidelines for Penn, Bagnoli announced he’d retire after this year…only to, three months after retirement, sign with the Lions.
Bagnoli’s move—from the faded, once great empire of Penn football to the empty, shriveling carcass of Columbia’s program—is without comparison. I’d compare it to if Charlie Sheen traded his life in 2004 for his life in 2014—everyone involved thinks they are winning, but everyone on the outside knows nobody is.
Pick: Columbia
PRINCETON AT YALE
Had last Saturday’s result gone the other way, the Tigers’ season would look completely different. At 6-3 in the Ancient Eight and just a couple five-minute stretches away from 8-1, Princeton fans could not only talk up their chances this week but also moving forward. The team’s best wings are young, and freshman guard Amir Bell is as good as any rookie not named Kyle Castlin.
But there’s a flipside to the coin. Outside of junior Hans Brase, the team struggles on the defensive glass, and Spencer Weisz hasn’t been able to take over games in Ivy League play. The group comes into New Haven against an angry Yale squad and a Player of the Year candidate in senior Justin Sears who had 25 and nine against them last time out. The Elis’ title hopes will ostensibly end if they lose here, and the players are well aware.
Pick: Yale
PENN AT BROWN
Underreported last week was Brown’s 17-point comeback against Cornell, with the Bears fighting off 27 points from Miller. Brown has won three of last five games since starting the Ancient Eight season 0-5 in league play. The Bears have rallied since the departure of Leland King, and was maybe two minutes away from having wins over both Harvard and Yale.
Penn, on the other hand, looks like it might be the worst team the league has seen in a decade. Star guard Tony Hicks was just suspended for the third time in three years. The school newspaper quoted one of the assistant coaches this week as saying that “this year in so many ways was about more than wins and losses.”
Howard, hold a second. I do believe that’s Lombardi puking six feet under.
Pick: Brown
HARVARD AT CORNELL
One of the most startling facts of the Crimson’s four-year run is the 22-4 road record the team has posted over the stretch. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, not getting the buzz he should for Ivy League Coach of the Year, is a master of motivation, preaching that the team be “tough and together” on the road. Against a Cornell team boasting a 308th-ranked offense, Harvard should be turning its focus to Columbia 10 minutes into the second half.
Pick: Harvard
DARTMOUTH AT CORNELL
The elven mavens of Hanover have flailed since an early season win over Harvard that looks more and more flukish with each passing weekend. Lead guard Alex Mitola is down to 40-percent shooting on the year, and only one rotation player is shooting better than 50 percent. However, Cornell police may have discovered the next Walter White—arresting a twenty-something holding 250 bags of heroin this week.
Better Call Saul, as the kids say.
Pick: Dartmouth
PENN AT YALE
After an unverified report came in last fall demonstrating that Yale’s undergraduate education routinely fluctuated between the “third … and fifteenth”-best in the country, its law school was the subject of this week’s putdown—ranking 14th in the National Law Journal’s annual rankings. In the same study, Penn ranked second.
Does that have any bearing on this game? Does Darien Nelson-Henry have what it takes to handle Justin Sears down low? Does a wolf look both ways before it marks its territory?
Sadly, the answer to all three is ‘likely not’.
Pick: Yale
PRINCETON AT BROWN
Harvard extended its winning streak over the Tigers to four games with a rousing comeback Saturday at Lavietes. Junior co-captain Siyani Chambers was the hero late—notching a steal and layup to give Harvard a late two-point lead and clinching the game with a jumper from the top of the key.
A bright spot emerged this week among the somnolent darkness in the form of The Daily Princetonian’s online content. Debuting what I hope becomes a weekly feature about the failings of furry rodents, the newspaper published a seminal work on, and I quote, “10 Reasons Squirrels Are The Worst.”
While not quite the excellence that was former Crimson president Samuel Y. Weinstock’s ’15 scintillating account of urban biomes, entitled “Yard Service Recycle Leaves into Mulch,” I commend Princeton for its efforts. Stay classy, men.
Pick: Princeton
HARVARD AT COLUMBIA
Over Harvard’s ridiculous road stretch, the routinely most challenging location has been Columbia’s Levein Gymnasium. Two years ago, the Crimson waited through a Saturday snowstorm delay only to be smoked by 15. Last year, a game-winning shot by Alex Rosenberg was called off on a questionable charge, and the Lions fell in double overtime.
Columbia guard Maodo Lo, who nearly carried Columbia to a victory in Harvard two weeks ago, is clicking on all cylinders—averaging 25.5 points a game last weekend. The Chairman has a wicked crossover, good vision, and a silky-smooth three-point shot. Asked about him Wednesday, Amaker—who watched his best wing defenders flail attempting to contain Lo last time out—shook his head and offered a succinct description of the man they call the “Chairman.”
“He’s…he’s good.”
Pick: Harvard

In our second installment of Flyby's Visitor's Guide for Junior Parents' Weekend, we're showcasing some places in Boston! Why not use your parents as an excuse to get on the T and spend their money at nice museums and restaurants?
IN BOSTON:
Being a Harvard student, you’re probably familiar with the standard tourist attractions in Boston: walking the Freedom Trail, going to a Red Sox game at Fenway Park, and eating Italian food in the North End and Chinese food in Chinatown. You should absolutely show your visitors all of those things if you want (just try not to let them overpay for lunch at the notoriously touristy Quincy Market), but once you finish those, here are some other unique attractions to show them:


1) Bunker Hill Monument: Built in 1843 to honor the fallen at the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Charlestown landmark obelisk’s nearby museum offers a refresher on the history of the 1775 battle fought here at Breed’s Hill. Be sure to climb the 294 steps to the top for one of the best, if not the best, views of Boston.
2) Public Garden: Be sure to walk here from Copley, taking in the nice buildings of Back Bay along Boylston and Newbury Streets on the way. The setting of Make Way for Ducklings is one of Boston’s prettiest parks, and the oldest botanical garden in the country. Boston Common, the oldest city park in the country, is right next door as well, and features ice skating in the winter.
3) Prudential Center Skywalk Observatory: Located on the 50th floor of the Prudential Center, Boston’s second-tallest building, the Skywalk Observatory offers a great view of Boston and features a number of exhibits on Boston’s history. Two floors above it is a pricey, fancy restaurant called Top of the Hub, which features the same view.


4) Copley Square: Perhaps the most architecturally beautiful public space in Boston, Copley Square is bounded by three magnificent National Historic Landmarks: the Boston Public Library (designed by Charles Follen McKim, built 1895), Trinity Church (Henry Hobson Richardson, 1872), and Old South Church (Charles Amos Cummings and Willard T. Sears, 1873). Be sure to go into the BPL and check out the murals by John Singer Sargent, marvel at the stained glass and statues of Trinity Church, and look around the magnificent Gothic architecture of Old South. Copley is also home to the tallest building in Boston– the glass prism that is the John Hancock Tower.
5) Beacon Hill: From John Singleton Copley to John Kerry, many of Boston’s elite have called this neighborhood of rowhouses north of Back Bay home over the centuries. It is also home to several sites that are part of Boston African American National Historic Site, including the Museum of African American History, as the neighborhood was the center of Boston’s African American community in the 19th century as well as a major center of the Abolitionist movement.
6) The First Church of Christ, Scientist: The mother church of the Christian Science denomination, founded in Boston by Mary Baker Eddy, the Christian Science Church features an impressive dome and fronts a nice public plaza. The Mapparium, in the adjacent Mary Baker Eddy Library, is a cool walk-in globe.


7) The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: One of the finest (and largest) art museums in the United States, the MFA’s mind-bogglingly massive collections could easily take an entire day to explore. While the MFA may be best-known for its colonial American paintings (like John Singleton Copley’s Watson and the Shark), John Singer Sargent murals, and Impressionist paintings, don’t overlook the museum’s tranquil Buddhist Temple Room, outstanding Japanese print collection, fine collection of South Asian art, and impressive collection of musical instruments. Plus, Harvard students get free admission! If you haven’t gotten your art fix here, head across the way to the nearby Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (also free for Harvard students), housed in the mansion of the socialite Isabella Stewart Gardner, where the collection is great, but has an eccentric layout that makes little sense.
8) The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston: This museum in the South Boston Waterfront appeals to those who prefer today’s artists over Rembrandt and Monet, or those who just happen to like contemporary art. In any case, the ICA is worth checking out for its unique architecture– the building, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro and opened in 2006, seems to hover precariously over Boston Harbor. In the summer, the museum capitalizes on its location on the waterfront by hosting a summer concert series. Current exhibitions at the ICA include Where the Stars Fall: Imagination and the American South and Sonic Arboretum, as well as a small permanent collection.


9) John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum: Designed by well-known architect I. M. Pei and opened in 1979, the JFK Library commands a wonderful waterfront location in Dorchester. It features numerous artifacts from former Crimson editor JFK’s life and presidency, including a reconstruction of the Oval Office. Take note, though, that the main exhibit galleries will be closed until mid-March.
10) Museum of Science: If your visitors like science, this large science museum located on a dam over the Charles River between Boston and Cambridge is a great place to go, and features an IMAX, dinosaurs, and many more cool exhibits. Just be forewarned: admission can be a bit steep, at $23 per person.
11) Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University: Trees, trees, and more trees. The Arnold Arboretum, located in Jamaica Plain and Roslindale and operated by Harvard, has lots and lots of them, including some that are extinct in their native range. All in all, it’s a cool place, and one that's very beautiful too. It’s a shame that we don't come check it out more often!


12) The South End: This suddenly trendy neighborhood located southeast of Back Bay has been experiencing a massive influx of young professionals in the last couple of decades. It is home to rows and rows of beautiful, well-kept row houses, and is at the epicenter of Boston’s dining scene. Be sure to check out the original location of Flour Bakery on Washington Street (which has since expanded to include a second location at Kendall Square), an excellent café that has become a staple of the neighborhood. Nearby are Franklin and Blackstone Squares, two beautiful town square parks. The neighborhood is also home to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston’s Roman Catholic cathedral that was built in 1875, and one of the most beautiful churches in the city, with its Gothic architecture and stained glass. The South End’s SoWa (South of Washington) district is also home to many art galleries and boutiques, and hosts the SoWa Open Market and SoWa Farmer’s Market on Sundays during the summer.
13) Paul S. Russell, M.D., Museum of Medical History and Innovation: This small museum on the sprawling West End campus of Massachusetts General Hospital has a number of really cool artifacts related to the history of medicine. Also be sure to check out the Ether Dome nearby if you or your visitors are interested in the history of science or medicine.
14) The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge: An icon of Boston since its construction as part of the Big Dig in 2002, the cable-stayed Zakim Bridge carries I-93 across the Charles River, linking the North End to Charlestown. The best view of this gorgeous bridge is from North Point Park in Cambridge.

Dear lonely classmates of Harvard,
It’s Caie and Will, your beloved Flyby advisors, back again with advice for the still-wintry world that is Harvard. Today, we were again impressed by the range of your issues, and look forward to answering a selection of those questions below! For those of you who still haven’t submitted, how else do you plan to solve your deeply-rooted insecurities, have the temperature  above freezing, or have the end of midterm season not just be the start of reading period and finals? Submit your questions, concerns, and unresolved love stories HERE, and we think you’ll find the sun may just start shining again (in April).
I am a freshman.  Do you recommend a conversation between next year's roommates to talk about how we manage living together next year?  I wish my roommates and I did this last Fall, but I don't want to look like a jerk.  How do you get a conversation started? First, acquire alcohol. Second, drink alcohol to “Optimal Buzz.” Third, discuss said topics.
Joey hated it when Chandler dated Janice. I can't stand my roommate's girlfriend.  Do I have to wait this out?  So the reality is that it’s not your relationship, and creating awkward tension when he’s probably not going to listen to you is probably, well, awkward. However, it’s important that you’re honest with him (you’re supposed to be the original bae here!), so we suggest you casually bring up something that bothers you and can be resolved (i.e., hey, if you could give me a 24-hour notice before you sexile me, that’d be chill, thanks bro!). Hopefully, the relationship will fade on its own, but if that’s in a while, you can only really control what directly pertains to your comfort and happiness. You live in the room, too, so if she’s forcing herself into your Fifa games and your Skype sessions with your mom, it’s not a bad idea to say something.
Does prolonged eye contact mean he is into me?Ooh, people looking at each other! How rare on Harvard’s cold, Canada-Goose-hooded campus! It depends on the situation, we think. If he’s staring at you while you’re telling a story, he may just have done speech and debate in high school like everyone here and is comfortable with, you know, face-to-face interaction. If he’s staring at you while you walk to class in the Science Center or talk to someone else, that’s more suspect. If he’s staring at you wherever you go, he’s probably Edward and you should consider seeking HUPD for help about a vampire-stalker (are those jokes still relevant anymore?). Wikihow says that an unforgettable kiss begins with prolonged eye contact, though, so if you’re into him, you know what to do.
Can becoming p-set partners lead to a romantic relationship?In the wise words of Ellie Goulding, anything could happen! There are multiple romantic aspects of a typical pset: numbers, word responses, calculations, hypotheses . . . Point is, becoming p-set partners could be the beginning of an everlasting power couple, especially since Thursday night pset parties are about as lively and promising as every weekend except Harvard-Yale here (jokes, jokes).
How do I make it clear to the male species that I'm a relationship person, not just a convenient hook-up?In the kindest way possible, have you ever considered not conveniently hooking up? Our verdict is, if you want to be a “dating” kind of person, say yes to dates, say no to hookups. We know, we know, boyfriends and dates don’t exist at Harvard! But somehow, magically, we do see couples on the Yard and believe in our heart of hearts that one in three of them have a chance of actually attending this school, and you can be one of them if you stop letting yourself be a side-piece and instead, assert yourself as the CENTERPIECE!
Do guys care more about ass or boobs?Will says: Every guy has different tastes, just like girls have different tastes for guys. Some guys are attracted by one more than the other, and much of the time attraction has nothing to do with either of those.
Caie says: First of all, you are a beautiful, strong, independent human for whom it should not really matter about what guys “care more about.” Also, on just a very simple practical level, what if this “guy” hypothetically cares more about “ass”? What are you going to hypothetically do about “caring” for this “guy”? I guess squats could change the shape of your “ass” for said “guy”, but there’s not normally much to be done about where lumps happen to sit on your body in the case of boobs (sorry!). I, for example, am most fond of the lump that sits on the area known as my stomach, and though I could hypothetically go to the “gym,” I’d be inclined to do so for myself, not for a so-called “guy.”
