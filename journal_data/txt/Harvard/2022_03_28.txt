After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, March 4, the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. A federal jury originally sentenced Tsarnaev to death in 2015, a decision that was later overturned by a federal appeals court in 2020. In early 2014, in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, we expressed sympathy for the city of Boston and denounced the attacks, but remained “categorically opposed to the death penalty.” As the court said, “Just to be crystal clear … Dzhokhar will remain confined to prison for the rest of his life, with the only question remaining being whether the government will end his life by executing him.” In 2022, our stance has not changed — the death penalty should not exist.
Consider that the Supreme Court’s verdict follows a wave of 13 federal executions carried out by the Trump administration in the span of six months, the first federal killings in 17 years; the 2021 execution of Oklahoma inmate John Marion Grant by lethal injection, during which Grant convulsed and vomited on his gurney as he lay dying; and the Biden administration’s reinstatement of the federal moratorium on the death penalty just last July.
For some, opposing the death penalty may be a matter of principle: Because each human life is special and important, ending it is impermissible in every instance. We are inclined to agree, but such moral absolutes are hard to reconcile with the harsh realities faced by people who have been hurt by acts of violence. It is not our place to argue moral right and wrong with the victims of the Boston bombing or the victims of violence anywhere.
While we can understand why some may support the death penalty, we remain unconvinced that the death penalty should be legally permissible. We don’t believe that the death penalty accomplishes either retribution or determent.
With regard to the former, each individual who has experienced violence has a different idea of what justice and healing look like. Some demand that those responsible pay with their lives, others choose to forgive. No one, however, should have their wounds continually reopened by the long process of appeals and reversals that capital punishment decisions often entail. Even when the perpetrator is executed, it is not as though the pain of losing a loved one will suddenly dissipate. In the end, the death penalty is an irrevocable punishment that is neither guaranteed to be worth the years of anguish spent waiting nor capable of healing trauma caused by violence.
With respect to determent, capital punishment may actually end up doing more harm than good. In cases of ideological violence such as the Boston Marathon bombing, execution can make a martyr of a perpetrator. Far from discouraging future acts of violence, the death penalty risks providing fodder for radicalization and provoking further retaliatory attacks. Not to mention, in the case of suicide attacks where the perpetrator lacks regard for their own life and safety, the death penalty fails immediately to be even a penalty.
Ultimately, we are left with a bleak picture. When confronted with tremendous losses caused by acts of extreme violence, it is understandable for us to seek some sort of action to take — actions that can emphasize our agency and counter the paralyzing feeling of powerlessness. But the death penalty is not this action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s talk about it. No, not about the weather. I am talking about the topics that make us uncomfortable. The conversations that result in harsh disagreement, draw a rift across generational divides, and culminate in fiery resentment.
Day in and day out, scenes of political arguments flash across our screens. The intention behind broadcasting these arguments is often sound and justified – exposing Americans to the scope and complexities of political viewpoints is vital for developing societal awareness. Much of modern political discourse, however, unfurls egregiously in execution.
My family routinely congregates in the living room and turns on the television to watch the news. Tonight, it is the senator from California and the congressman from Texas, battling without mincing words in front of a virtual audience of exasperated viewers — including myself. Neither party is listening to each other nor allowing the other to complete their full sentence. The news anchor frantically tries to halt the persistent bickering and get a word in, yet fails. In frustration, my mother reaches out for the remote and switches to another channel.
The way perspectives are communicated in America must be fundamentally transformed.
We fail in nearly every aspect of how humans are supposed to act toward one another. We are unable to explain our individual perspectives without being interrupted, judged, or stereotyped. We hardly engage in dialogues without preconceptions in mind. We shutter our minds to the mere idea of altering our opinions, even upon accumulating newfound insight.
These statements are not philosophical preachings: they are candidly visible in reality today.
I remember speaking to my friend about our political views a few weeks ago in my dorm. Specifically, we were discussing our opinions on the hot-button issue of abortion. It quickly became apparent that our beliefs lay on opposite ends of the spectrum — still, the conversation was incredibly fulfilling. Thoroughly grasping the life experiences that had shaped his perspective prompted me to recognize how our surrounding awareness of the world influences the viewpoints we bear.
The discourse my friend and I engaged in was truly insightful, particularly in how I was compelled to back up my beliefs concretely in response to his assertions. I genuinely appreciated our conversation and the time I dedicated to understanding his mindset. It is our individual responsibility to share the understandings we have been lucky enough to acquire. What is equally, if not more important, is that we also contemplate the cherished perceptions of the individuals surrounding us.
As my conversation with my friend drew to a close, my friend expressed gratitude for being able to share his views so freely with me. Upon asking for elaboration, I was alarmed by his self-described uneasiness with imparting his thoughts during previous interactions with other people. Regardless of the fact that we disagreed with one another, spending the time to fully understand the roots of my friend’s arguments and how past life experiences had influenced his stances on topical societal issues was eye-opening. Our dialogue was one I was particularly grateful for: one that I feel we both learned from, even if it did not dramatically alter our current views.
Harvard’s institutional principles hinge on the idea of “semper veritas” — always seeking the truth. This motto of consolidating all means of knowledge in discovering life truths is embedded throughout Harvard history. The responsibility to carry out this belief lies on the shoulders of every Harvard student. And it starts by genuinely listening and considering the thoughts of the people around us.
The mission toward veritas manifests itself in a variety of Harvard contexts. The spread of perspectives unravels passionately over dining hall conversations where students congregate to share lived experiences with one another. Professors and students engage in valuable academic discourse in lecture halls, filling in gaps of knowledge and creating pores of new questions that have yet to carry a definitive answer. Guest speakers from across the globe descend the steps of Memorial Hall to provide an awareness of the world that the Cambridge bubble simply cannot comprehensively convey.
These moments are applaudable, but more can still be done to open our conversations to new ideas. Harvard is often thought of as a bastion of elite liberalism. Reckoning with just one side of a belief leaves behind a gaping understanding of the other end of the spectrum. Confronting other perspectives enables us to fully justify our own by laying down definitive reasoning that reconciles the inaccuracies we perceive in opposing ideals.
If our country aspires for unity: that is, if we yearn to be a nation that collectively tackles issues such as war, pandemics, inequity, and healthcare, we must radically transform the way we engage in discussion with one another. It does not matter whether someone is rich or poor, Black or white, or Democratic or Republican. Every single one of us must be held accountable for listening to each other with utter empathy and respect, even when it seems displeasing to do so.
America is renowned for the freedom it offers its citizens to wholeheartedly disseminate their beliefs, perspectives, and ideas. Let’s keep this a reality for all the generations who will follow in our footsteps. This mission begins with us at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the three months leading up to my acceptance to Harvard, I was completely, 100 percent sure I was headed to Yale. During those three months, I spent a lot of time imagining my future in New Haven. One recurrent theme: I would double major in something in the sciences and something in the humanities. The idea of double majoring was exciting; I enjoyed everything I was doing in high school, and I loved not having to choose just one path forward.
Then I chose Harvard. The only disappointment was that Harvard had joint, rather than double, concentrations. I knew how difficult it would be to blend science and humanities concentrations into a single cohesive thesis, a requirement of Harvard’s joint concentration program.
So I didn’t even try. I had more experience in the humanities, which seemed like a natural place to start at a new school. I took four humanities courses my freshman fall and fell in love with the History and Literature concentration. I was happy; I had a path.
Until I didn’t.
I rediscovered my interest in science this past summer and fall. I found myself wondering why I had needed to rediscover it, why I had ever stopped taking science classes in the first place, why I hadn’t taken them as a freshman at Harvard. As a senior in high school, I had particularly enjoyed a Molecular Biology Research class and told people I was considering doing an MD/PhD. Four months later when I arrived at Harvard, the possibility of pursuing that path was no longer on my mind.
I needed a path that was different from what Harvard offered me. I needed Harvard to show me that there was a purpose and place for my dual interest in science and the humanities. I needed Harvard to show me that it was possible to read Catullus and make pedigree charts, to study the historiography of the Civil War and find the pH of a solution, at the same time.
But instead, the implicit message I got from Harvard was that I either had to choose one, or combine both. So I chose one.
I want to be clear: I do not regret my choice. If I could go back and redo it, I would still make the same decision. I just wish I could have done it alongside science courses.
You must be thinking: No one restricted your ability to take both humanities and science classes. You could have tried it. You should have tried it.
And you’re right. I should have.
But I was 18 years old. When I selected my courses for freshman fall, I had lived away from home for a total of five days in my entire life. I didn’t know how to do this whole “college” thing yet. I looked to my institution to guide me, to show me what was possible, to provide a path forward.
And when the path that Harvard provided looked different than the one I had imagined, I figured I was the one with impractical ideas. A policy permitting double concentrations would send a very specific — and much needed — message to students like me who are interested in multiple subjects and are wondering whether it is possible to simultaneously study the humanities and STEM.
Faculty critics of the proposal for double concentrations have suggested that double concentrations will just be another source of stress and pressure on students, who will feel like they have to get that extra line on their resume if provided the opportunity to do so. We may be young enough to need our institution to provide us a path forward, but we don’t need to be protected from our own ambition. That feels infantilizing; that’s not your role. Provide opportunity; don’t take it away.
Yes, some students may feel that pressure, but an institution like Harvard, which is devoted to the pursuit of knowledge at the highest levels, should not be basing institutional decisions on the fact that there may be a few students here for the wrong reasons. You should be creating policies to help students who are hungry for knowledge, who are curious and excited to explore the liberal arts — students who love learning and want to know that there is a place for them and their interests at this institution.
If the faculty ratifies the current proposal for double concentrations, I’m excited to declare a second concentration in Human Developmental & Regenerative Biology. But it’s too late for this policy change to have its full impact on me. Because to me, the purpose of this policy is not an extra line on my resume. The purpose of this policy lies in what it tells 18-year-olds who are curious and hungry and excited to explore Harvard about the possibilities that exist here, who need to see that what they seek in their Harvard education is possible and institutionalized.
To the faculty with a vote on the policy: Give the next generation of science-loving humanists, and humanities-loving scientists, a path forward. Give us a tangible acknowledgement that we don’t have to change, that we can and will be able to do both concurrently. Show us this when we are impressionable 18-year-olds, new to Harvard and to adulthood, and then let us experience the profound intellectual discovery that will follow.
Very infrequently does such a simple policy change have the potential for such a significant positive impact on students. Vote in favor of the proposal for double concentrations. Give students another path forward and 50 years from now, your decision will still be having an impact.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After decades in higher education administration — including 11 years as Amherst College’s first female president and nearly four years on Harvard’s highest governing board — Carolyn A. “Biddy” Martin is set to return to the classroom at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Martin will retire from Amherst at the end of the academic year. Within HGSE’s President-in-Residence program, she will serve as a mentor for graduate students and write case studies based on her experiences in higher education. She will join the program alongside Framingham State University President F. Javier Cevallos for the 2022-23 academic year.
Martin said she is excited to connect with a cohort of students at Harvard.
“I have not been able to teach while at Amherst,” she said. “I haven’t taught my own class, or really had a sustained relationship with a particular group of students in the classroom — and so yes, I’m really looking forward to teaching.”
Raised in rural Virginia, Martin studied English at the College of William and Mary before going on to earn her Ph.D. in German literature at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She was a faculty member at Cornell University for more than 20 years before serving as chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and provost of Cornell.
In 2011, Martin became a historic first at Amherst as its first female and openly lesbian president, and in 2018, she joined the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
Martin said she hopes to explore her intellectual interests with expanded flexibility at HGSE after leaving Amherst leadership.
“I’ve been doing these kinds of jobs for so long, and working my whole life,” she said. “This gives me a way of creating time for more of a personal life, but also having the intellectual stimulation that I like to thrive on.”
According to Judith Block McLaughlin, the program’s founder and a senior lecturer at the Education School, what began as individual invitations for retiring presidents to visit her classroom back in 2001 developed into the President-in-Residence program as it gained popularity among university leaders.
McLaughlin described the program as a “win-win” for the presidents and graduate students.
“It was a win for Graduate School of Education students to have a former president sit in their class and go to lunch with them, sit down and chat with them about their career interests and final paper topics,” she said. “It was equally a big win for the presidents — they loved having this opportunity to share their learning with the next generation of leaders.”
The Presidents-in-Residence are “embedded” in the class Education A701: “Creating the Future of American Postsecondary Education,” said Francesca Purcell, director of the Higher Education Program and the course’s instructor.
After her career in higher education administration, Martin said she looks forward to crafting case studies and interacting with students.
“The seminar is organized in such a way that our responsibility as the Presidents-in-Residence is to create case studies, and I’m really looking forward to that, partly because these jobs leave very little time — or mine, anyway — has left very little time to think about what I’m experiencing,” she said.
Purcell said Martin will be “a great inspiration” to students as a first-generation, low-income college graduate as well as a female and openly lesbian leader.
“Her personal experiences coming through higher ed, and being at such high levels, are also going to be a great inspiration for our students,” Purcell said. “I’m excited about that piece as well.”

Lisa J. Kewley will serve as the next director of Harvard’s Center for Astrophysics, a collaboration between the Harvard College Observatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
The CFA is composed of over 850 scientists, researchers, and staff and aims to answer questions about the makeup of the universe by developing tools that expand the capabilities of modern-day observatories.
Kewley will head eight scientific divisions at nine of the CFA’s facilities and institutes in her new role, which begins July 1. She currently serves as the director of ASTRO 3D, a seven-year $40 million project that has brought together 300 astronomers to study the evolution of light, matter, and the elements.
Kewley wrote in an email she is looking forward to the future of the CFA and the creation of new telescopes and technologies.
“The coming decade will be an extremely exciting time for astrophysics with the next generation space and ground based telescopes being built and coming on-line,” Kewley wrote. “The CFA has expertise across the full electromagnetic spectrum from the X-rays through to the radio and sub-mm, as well as a world-leading theory program.”
Kewley described her intention to design a long-term plan to address astronomy’s “biggest questions” while also creating astronomy outreach programs for U.S. students.
“I will bring together people from across the CFA to develop a 10-year scientific strategic plan which brings together the expertise across the CFA to answer some of astronomy's biggest questions and builds readiness for the next generation of telescopes,” Kewley wrote. “I will also work with Smithsonian to develop nationwide education and outreach programs to bring astronomy to school kids across the US.”
Kewley added that she plans to promote gender equity in the workforce through her new role.
“I will be introducing a broad range of initiatives which are aimed at equity in promotions, recruitment, and retention, as well as building a positive, supportive, and inclusive culture,” Kewley wrote.
Ellen R. Stofan, the Smithsonian's Under Secretary for Science and Research, voiced her support for Kewley’s appointment, noting her achievement of gender equity at ASTRO 3D under her directorship.
“Dr. Kewley’s exceptional career, strong leadership skills, and innovative ideas about the future for CFA proved her to be the best person for the role,” Stofan wrote. “ASTRO 3D’s 50:50 gender balance is a testament to her dedication for shaping STEM into a more equitable future.”
The outgoing director of the Center for Astrophysics, Charles R. Alcock, described Kewley as a “brilliant scientist and a charismatic, thoughtful, considerate leader” in an email.
Alcock acknowledged a variety of scientific topics the CFA can pursue under Kewley’s leadership, including potential signs of life on nearby planets or “empirical understandings” of black holes.
“The best work emerges from the discussions among the scientists, and the surprises that emerge are the most rewarding,” Alcock wrote.

One month after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, more than one hundred demonstrators rallied in Harvard Yard on Saturday in support of Harvard students and scholars impacted by the war.
Harvard students, parents, faculty members, and other supporters attended the protest, the second major rally on campus since the war began. Speakers took turns denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin — whose invasion of Ukraine has left more than 1,100 civilians dead — and calling for the University to do more to help affected Harvard affiliates.
“We’re here at the richest and most influential university in the history of the richest and most influential country,” Greg M. Epstein, president of the Harvard Chaplains, told the crowd. “Harvard University must do more to help these students — these students and more. We must.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow condemned the invasion in a Feb. 28 event hosted by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies and the Ukrainian Research Institute.
“Harvard will continue to support in whatever ways we can members of our community who face grave uncertainty,” Bacow said. “We will continue to share knowledge of Ukraine and advance understanding of its culture, history, and language.”
Andrew Berry, a lecturer on organismic and evolutionary biology who attended the rally, said he was concerned about student well-being.
“If Ukrainian students, or affected students, are trying to get appointments with University mental health [services], for obvious reasons, and they're having to wait and wait and wait — that's crazy, and it's such an easy thing to change,” he said in an interview.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on concerns about wait times for Counseling and Mental Health Services. The wait times for new patients to receive appointments with Harvard clinicians reached six weeks last month, according to CAMHS chief Barbara Lewis.
Jane Lytvynenko, a Ukrainian research fellow at the Shorenstein Center, said she has family displaced by the war and friends who are still in danger.
“Today, on family weekend at Harvard, a lot of people are lucky enough to be able to hug their family, to be able to see their family, to be able to speak to their family,” Lytvynenko said. “Many people here do not have information about their loved ones.”
Taisa Kulyk ’22 called on the U.S. to supply Ukraine with more anti-aircraft weapons and drones.
“The world cannot just bear witness to terrorism on this scale and choose not to stop it,” she said. “It has been a month. Bombs can be stopped. Airplanes can be stopped.”
But not everyone at the rally supported sending more weapons to Ukraine.
Michael A. Miccioli ’22 silently held two signs behind the speakers that read “Abolish NATO” and “No Weapons, No Sanctions, No No-Fly Zone, Negotiate!”
In an interview during the rally, Miccioli refused to categorize his action as a counter-protest, noting he supports several of the organizers’ humanitarian demands.
“I support letting in as many Ukrainian refugees as would like to come, as well as supporting refugees from anywhere across the world,” he said.
Miccioli said he doesn’t support a no-fly zone because it would result in “conventional warfare with another nuclear armed power” which might lead to “World War III and potentially a nuclear holocaust.”
“A no-fly zone — which we're seeing Zelenskyy call for, which we’re seeing certain people in Congress call for — is just completely insane to me,” he added.
Four of the rally’s attendees blocked Miccioli’s signs by sitting in front of them, drawing a loud round of applause. Afterward, another supporter of the rally ripped the signs out of Miccioli’s hands and threw them on the ground.
Ukrainian student Yegor Tverdokhlibov ’25 said he disagreed with NATO’s reluctance to join the fight against Russia.
“I think that NATO is afraid of Putin, but I don’t think they should be afraid,” he said.
“I think they’re wrong because if we stopped Russia right now, there'll be one hundred less wars in the future,” Tverdokhlibov added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the eve of a referendum that will determine the Harvard Undergraduate Council’s future, the body held a meeting on Sunday that descended into disarray with arguments, interruptions, and a dramatic early exit by the UC’s president.
In an eleventh hour twist, the council voted to remove a question about designating Election Day as a University holiday from the referendum ballot set to go to students on Monday.
The meeting came less than 24 hours before the start of the controversial referendum, in which undergraduates will vote whether to dissolve the UC in favor of a new constitution that would form the “Harvard Undergraduate Association,” an alternative student government backed by the UC’s current president, Michael Y. Cheng ’22.
As part of the referendum, students will also weigh in on Harvard’s Covid-19 policies — a source of sporadic contention among undergraduates.
As of press time at 4 a.m. Monday, the UC’s Elections Commission had yet to send an email informing the student body of the referendum vote, apparently due to a disagreement between Cheng and UC Secretary Jane Oh.
At Sunday’s meeting, Cheng accused Oh of changing the password to a shared account used to send emails to the student body. After the meeting, Oh confirmed she changed the password, preventing Cheng or UC Vice President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 from sending school-wide messages.
“Michael cannot be consistently sending out emails without anybody else knowing,” Oh said after the meeting Sunday. “We’ve halted everything for now.”
Oh added that the UC leaders could contact the communications chair to request that an email be sent out.
The UC constitution calls for the body’s communications director to run the account “in conjunction with and with the approval of the President, operate the UC-President mailing account.”
“All messages sent from the president@harvarduc.org email account must be approved by the President,” the constitution says.
Cheng and de Kanter have penned several emails to the student body calling for the dissolution of the UC.
“It’s not just messing me up, it’s also messing up the UC Elections Commission,” said Cheng.
Cheng kicked off Sunday’s meeting by denouncing calls for students to boycott the referendum, which were disseminated by an anonymous Instagram account in recent days.
“I think the level of civil discourse on the new constitution versus the UC constitution has been very disappointing,” said Cheng.
The ballot was originally set to include a third question asking students if they support designating Election Day as an instruction-free University holiday. But on Sunday, the Council voted to remove the question from the ballot after members of the Harvard Votes Challenge — a non-partisan group run by the Harvard Institute of Politics that co-sponsored the proposal — asked for it to be included as part of a different referendum next semester.
“Harvard Votes Challenge members know that this referendum is not happening in a vacuum,” said Kiersten B. Hash ’25, the Votes Challenge’s advocacy director.
Lowell House Representative LyLena D. Estabine ’24 pressed Hash on why HVC would “move this referendum, rather than just trying to increase voter turnout.”
“Internally, for Harvard Votes Challenge, there is conflict for students that are in favor of boycotting the referendum — or voting no — and students that want to vote yes,” Hash replied. “So it’s not just a consensus that we can make.”
The debate over removing the question from the referendum dragged on for roughly 30 minutes, preventing the Council from getting to other legislation on its docket — which angered some members.
The council eventually moved on to pass a motion calling for the phrase “in extension studies” to be removed from degree names at the Harvard Extension School.
“We have a guest here,” Ryan P. McCarthy ’24 said, referring to Extension School student Kody Christiansen, who co-sponsored the degree names proposal. “I feel like we’ve been incredibly disrespectful to him by wasting time throughout this entire process, and I would love to see his legislation get passed.”
After the legislation was passed, Cheng moved to adjourn the meeting, which had exceeded its allotted 90 minutes. But with legislation still on the agenda, some UC members objected.
But Cheng opted to call it a night — at least for himself.
“You have a right to exercise your first amendment speech rights. Thank you, and goodnight,” Cheng said before dropping his microphone and exiting the room.
de Kanter chaired the meeting for the additional time as members passed a series of club funding bills via unanimous consent.
Correction: March 29, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the Harvard Votes Challenge called for a UC referendum question asking students if they support designating Election Day as an instruction-free University holiday to be included as part of a referendum next semester, instead of this term. In fact, individual members of the group asked for the vote to be pushed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four months after taking over as president of the Harvard Undergraduate Council, Michael Y. Cheng ’22 will finally learn the fate of his marquee campaign promise: to replace the institution he now leads.
Cheng and UC Vice President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 unveiled the draft of a proposed new constitution in an email to undergraduates last week. If passed, the constitution would dismantle the UC’s existing structure and replace it with the “Harvard Undergraduate Association,” a body led by two co-presidents and made up of fewer elected members who would manage seven issue-focused teams.
The new constitution was drafted over the course of several months by the Citizens’ Assembly, a group of randomly-selected undergraduates convened by Cheng.
The College-wide referendum, set to run from Monday to Thursday, will determine whether the UC will undergo a complete constitutional overhaul and be replaced by the HUA — or survive in its current state.
Here’s what you need to know about the vote.
Beginning on Monday at 12 p.m., undergraduates will cast their vote on two referendum questions, including a “yes” or “no” vote on the passage of the new HUA constitution.
In order for the HUA to pass, two-fifths of the student body must turn out to vote. Two-thirds of voters must vote “yes” on the new constitution.
The other referendum question on the ballot asks undergraduates whether they approve of Harvard’s Covid-19 policies.
If approved by voters, the HUA would be established by May 8, according to the proposed constitution. Initial HUA elections would take place by April 30.
But current UC members would have some say in the process. Under the HUA’s transition guidelines, applicants for an interim election commission would be selected by the outgoing UC executive board. The interim election commission would be responsible for running HUA’s first elections.
If the board cannot finalize its selections by April 6, the Dean of Students Office would choose students to serve on the commission.
Based on procedures set by the interim commission, an election for HUA officers — including the co-presidents — would take place via school-wide ranked-choice voting.
The guide says students would not see immediate changes to club funding.
“The Undergraduate Council’s regular student organization funding process will be maintained as normal through the end of the semester, with funding based on the budget agreed upon by the UC Treasurer,” it reads.
If the referendum fails, the UC will continue to operate as normal, though a successful petition could get the HUA — or another proposed constitution — on a future ballot.
With Cheng set to graduate in May — only halfway through his yearlong term — the fate of the body is uncertain. The new president of the student government will ascend through one of two routes — a new election triggered by the referendum or the promotion of the body’s current vice president, de Kanter.
A major difference between the UC and the HUA is leadership structure.
Currently, the UC has an executive board consisting of its president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. The HUA would be led by two co-presidents who would oversee seven popularly elected officers.
Each of the officers would lead a team centered around one of seven issues — finance, social life, extracurriculars, academic, residential life, well-being, and sports. The co-presidents would also serve as officers, co-leading the executive team.
Under the HUA constitution, the co-presidents would be responsible for proposing team budgets, meeting with school administrators, maintaining the website, and sending school-wide emails. In a departure from the UC’s well-defined approval process for official communications, the HUA simply requires that the co-presidents “must seek input on these communications.”
Within each of the teams, project leaders would be appointed at the sole discretion of team officers to lead an issue-based initiative.
Any College student would be able to assist in the initiatives as “volunteers.”
Clubs would be able to receive funding from the HUA by submitting requests for either “expected” costs or “unforeseen” expenses. Expected costs would be approved on a semesterly basis by the body, while unforeseen expenses would be considered monthly.
Currently, the UC typically approves club funding weekly at its general meetings.
The HUA constitution does not elaborate on the exact structure of its finance team, but it does require that at least two people have access to the HUA checking account.
The HUA constitution also details several checks on the finance team’s funding activity, including monthly reviews and external audits occurring every three years.
Yes. But since all HUA officer positions would be elected via a school-wide ranked choice vote, some critics of the proposed constitution say freshmen would be unlikely to be elected to the body.
Proponents of the HUA argue the structure would better enable freshmen to get involved in specific issues as volunteers.
The HUA constitution stipulates that officers can only hold a given position for a single term.
In an email to the student body Thursday, Cheng promised that if the HUA were to pass, “the UC’s hundreds of thousands of dollars will go to direct refund checks for students, House Committees, and student organizations.” But he said in a later interview the exact form of repayment was pending.
Corrections: March 28, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the UC referendum will run from Monday to Wednesday. In fact, it is scheduled to conclude on Thursday. 
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the proposed Harvard Undergraduate Association would approve all club funding on a monthly basis. In fact, the body would approve club grants for "expected" costs on a semesterly basis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly six months of training and competition ended on the highest note for Harvard women’s swim and dive as they claimed their fifteenth Ivy League Championship title in program history. However, work was not done quite yet for senior swimmer Felicia Pasadyn and sophomore diver Liz Miclau.
This past week, from March 23 through March 26, Pasadyn and Miclau competed at Georgia Tech’s McAuley Aquatic Center in the 2022 NCAA Women’s Swim and Dive Division I Championships. Pasadyn is one out of only 281 swimmers across all Division I programs to have made it to the NCAA Championships after qualifying in the the 400-yard individual medley, 200-yard backstroke, and 200-yard individual medley. After coming off wins in both the 400 IM and 200 back at the Ivy league Championships, Pasadyn was well prepared and in great form to compete. Pasadyn qualified for NCAA’s two years ago, during her first year, before the meet was canceled due to Covid-19, making her all the more excited and eager to compete this year on the largest stage.
Miclau, having traveled with Pasadyn to Georgia, found herself in the top form as well, as one out of only 41 divers across the nation’s DI diving programs to make it this far in the season. She qualified for the three-meter diving event and the platform diving event at the 2022 NCAA Zone A Diving Championships.
Pasadyn was off to the races on Thursday, competing in the 200 IM where she posted a season-best time of 1:57.36 in the preliminary heats. Pasadyn’s record setting was not limited to crushing just her own best times, but the program’s as well. On Friday, Pasadyn set a program and personal record of 4:08.25 in the 400 IM.
“It was so unexpected,” Pasadyn emphasized. “Getting fifteenth place in the nation was really special. I was not expecting that at all.”
Pasadyn’s 400 IM success garnered her the status of All-America honors, an award achieved by those who place in the top sixteen in the nation in an event. However, Pasadyn won accolades not only in the pool, but out of it as well. On Friday, she was presented the NCAA Elite 90 award, a prestigious honor that denotes her as having the highest cumulative GPA out of all the participants on site competing in the NCAA Swim and Dive Championships. Keep in mind, Pasadyn achieves this award as a nineteen-year-old senior in just her third year of college. Pasadyn concluded her time at the championship meet by competing on Saturday in the 200 back, where she swam a time of 1:54.06, placing 28th.
The diving championships began for Miclau on Friday when she competed in the three-meter diving competition and placed 47th in the country with a score of 242.40.
On Saturday, she continued her championship meet diving in a fiercely competitive field of the best platform divers in the nation, placing 33rd with a score of 240.40. Her largest scoring dive was an incredible back two-and-a-half somersault tuck which recorded a score of 56.40.
Miclau reflected on her success in making it to this pinnacle of the season contributing it largely to her dedication and her team’s support. She spent a large part of her gap year training and diving at high levels to prepare her for big moments like this championship.
“During my year off I trained and got to compete competitively at a few international meets. I feel like I had a lot of personal growth, and by the time this [NCAAs] came around I was more prepared and more self-confident,” she explained.
When talking to Pasadyn and Miclau, both athletes emphasized that they could not be more proud of being a part of the Harvard women’s swim and dive program. They were both overwhelmed by the support and love they received from their teammates and community.
“So many people would come to practice every day to support me and just be so encouraging,” said Pasadyn.
Not only did her teammates extend their season to practice with and help her in any way possible, but they supported and motivated her during the week of competition.
“The amount of texts I received, goodie bags, and letters really spoke to how encouraging and empowering the team is. I am so grateful for how supportive they were because it really felt like they were doing it with me,” boasted Pasadyn.
“There is really nothing like competing on the team,” said Miclau. “The experience of being on the team and having everyone around you at every meet is incredible.”
Miclau, a sophomore, will be back diving for the Crimson next year, hoping to take her experiences and success at NCAAs back to help the program compete for their sixteenth Ivy League title in 2023 as the team looks to defend this year’s title. Pasadyn, who activated Advanced Standing, will graduate early this May and end her time with the Crimson, but will go on to swim for Ohio State while getting a Master of Arts in Bioethics degree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To conclude a long season, including the challenges of fighting against Covid-19 isolations and injuries, Harvard Wrestling (4-5 EIWA) sent head coach Jay Weiss and sophomore Philip Conigliaro to Detroit, Mich. to compete in the 2022 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships.
To qualify for the national championship, Conigliaro dominated the field at the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA) conference tournament, going 4-0 to win the 165-pound weight class and securing the Crimson’s first EIWA title since 2016. He tallied a technical fall as well as three decision victories at the conference meet, earning the No. 8 seed headed into nationals.
In Detroit, Conigliaro opened Thursday with a 6-4 victory over No. 25 seed Brevin Cassella of Binghamton University in the Round of 32. Later that day, Conigliaro fell to the No. 9 seed, West Virginia’s Payton Hall, in a 7-3 decision in the Round of 16, which sent him to the wrestlebacks.
On Friday, the sophomore from Dedham, Mass. came out strong with a 5-3 win against the No. 25 seed, Lucas Revano, from the University of Pennsylvania in Consolation Round Two of wrestlebacks. He followed that up with a decisive 7-2 decision against Austin Yant of the University of Northern Iowa, the No. 16 seed, before his season was put to a close by the No. 3 seed, Iowa’s Alex Marinelli, in the Round of 12.
“It was three years in the making, so I was just really excited to go out there and experience it for the first time,” Conigliaro said. “The crowds were nothing compared to what I’m used to. You’re wrestling in front of 15,000 people instead of just a couple hundred.”
“I don’t know if he had his best on the first day of the NCAA tournament, [but] the second day he came bouncing back hard,” said Harvard Wrestling head coach Jay Weiss when reflecting on Conigliaro’s performance. “Two big wins to put him into the Round of 12, which is the best and the worst round of wrestling. If you win, you’re All-American, you lose, you get a slap on the back,” he continued.
Conigliaro fell short in the Round of 12, losing 6-2 and walking away from a phenomenal year just short of All-American status.
“You walk back to that locker room, you have a lonely, lonely time,” Weiss said when asked if this result would motivate Conigliaro. “If that doesn’t motivate you, you’re in the wrong sport. Absolutely this is what’s going to motivate him and bring him to a better place down the road.”
“I was just grateful to compete,” Conigliaro said. “Being there wrestling the top ten guys in the country makes me believe that I can get on the podium for sure."
Conigliaro had some big takedowns that, combined with his escapes, led him to his three decision victories over the tournament weekend. Conigliaro’s focus was put to the test, as he was aware that he had to be at his peak performance all week.
“They call it March Madness for a reason, because anything could happen,” Conigliaro said.
Conigliaro credited his trust in his game plan during competition, especially against Revano, which allowed him to get a takedown in the first period. He then held his lead to emerge victorious and keep his hopes alive in the championships.
The 165-pound sophomore had his first season in 2019-2020 cut short due to the pandemic, and the team did not compete in what should have been his second season in 2020-2021.
“We didn’t compete last year, and no one got hurt because no one cut weight, but to go from that to [competing], guys got banged up, guys got COVID,” admitted Weiss. “It was hard to say that it was a successful season, we dealt with a lot of adversity.”
However, despite all the adversity the team has faced, Weiss had nothing but positivity when speaking on Conigliaro and the team’s future.
“Phil’s real close. He can beat anybody, and it really sets us up for what’s going to be a good year,” Weiss said. “He has two more years in, so I think he’s going to win it.”
Looking ahead to next season, Coach Weiss is especially optimistic.
“We have the right guys in the right places, and I really think we probably [have] more talent than I’ve ever seen in my short career here,” said the coach of 27 years. “So, I think there are things that we’ve got to do. We just need to have a good spring and good summer: that’s what’s going to determine where we are going into next November.”

Ever since I committed to Harvard, I’ve been looking forward to Housing Day. I couldn’t wait to have way-too-much house pride, meet other upperclassmen, and get my complete “Harvard introduction.” Housing Day 2022 came and went, so here is a first year’s Housing Day expectations vs. reality comparison for the much-anticipated event.
Pre-Housing Day Thoughts and Expectations
Get a River House. That’s not only an expectation for all first years but a deep-rooted desire. Even typing it out seems like bad luck, so I’m currently knocking on wood to scare away any bad-juju. The Quad is definitely not as bad as people make it out to be, and if I am sorted into the Quad I’m sure I will come to love it. That being said, I’m going to be honest here — I want a River House.
I predict that upperclassmen will storm our room at around 9 a.m. I fear that if they are any later than that, at least one person in my blocking group will start crying out of stress (the Housing Day process is pretty overwhelming as is, and we’re all pretty emotionally volatile about it already). I’m really excited to sleepover with my blocking group, but I’m sure we won’t get much sleep because of River Run our nerves. I also hope that I will be in the same house as my friends in different blocking groups. That just seems right mathematically given that there are only 12 houses, and I’d like to think I know people in 12 different blocking groups. I look forward to hanging out in the House I’m sorted into, and getting some good House merch.
I’m sure there will be a frenzy of people asking each other what House they got once dorm storming is over. I, personally, plan to text at least ten people because I’m just so curious to see who will get quadded. I can’t wait to experience one of the most hallowed Harvard traditions. And, no matter what happens, the energy and pride felt by all first-years will be off the charts.
Reality 
I got quadded. 
Yes, it was quite a shock to me too. I will be blaming the fact that I wrote, “I expect to get a River House” above. Right after we found out, I’m not going to lie — I did text my parents that this was my 13th reason, and someone in my blocking group did end up crying.
There was a frenzy in the Yard. Even people that I’ve talked to maybe twice came up to me to ask what house I got. When I told them that I got Pfoho, they all responded with, “I’m sorry” or, “Oh no, the Quad…. It’ll be okay.” I found this slew of comments to be the worst part about getting quadded. The Housing Day experience turned out to be pretty unfulfilling because I felt I couldn’t be happy or proud of the house I got like everyone else. So, my blocking group and I sought refuge at Bluestone Lane and then I skipped Expos, as one naturally does after getting quadded.
At night, we all ventured to the Quad for dinner. I wish this wasn’t true, but seeing Pfoho in person did not quell my fears. When we toured the Igloo, one of my friends literally broke into tears because, honestly, the place seemed a little depressing.
After our not-so-reassuring visit to Pfoho, a bunch of freshmen walked back to the Yard together, since, of course, the Quad shuttle had broken down. I came to realize that most of my non-blockmate friends also got quadded! Turns out, there is truly no greater bonding experience than getting quadded, and we all immediately developed a little community. We created a Snapchat group chat, started making merch (aka t-shirts that say “PfoHOES”, “cabDADDIES”, “PURRier”), and began to incorporate as many Quad jokes as possible into our vocabulary. An Instagram story I saw the next morning captured my feelings about getting quadded really well: “Better to take a L together than a W alone.” In my semi-depressed state, that really hit.
Looking back, I have mixed feelings about Housing Day. Truthfully, I was disappointed by the outcome, and maybe I will always be ever-so-slightly upset about getting quadded. However, as more time goes by, I find that I’m becoming more and more excited about my future in Pfoho. I truly can’t wait to join the tight-knit Quad community (the sQUAD if I may) with so many of my friends. And, most importantly, I can’t pfwait to pfmake so pfmany of out pfpocket Pfoho pfpuns pfor no pfreason.
