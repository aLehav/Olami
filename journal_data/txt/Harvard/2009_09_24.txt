The Harvard-Allston Partnership Fund has been a high note in an often tenuous inter-community relationship. The program provides small grants to local non-profit organizations to support community development projects in the Allston area. The first grants were distributed in June, and the project will begin accepting its second set of proposals this month. The plan is in line with Harvard’s commitment to support the Allston community, and we are encouraged by its progress.
Harvard has promised to distribute $100,000 in these awards each year for five-years. We understand that $500,000 is not an especially large sum of money, even within the $25 million in benefits that Harvard will disburse to Allston as part of the Cooperation Agreement for the Harvard Science Complex. However, the money is important in that it demonstrates Harvard’s real interest in fostering community in Allston. The grants are distributed by a team of Allston-Brighton residents, fostering a sense of ownership in the Harvard construction projects that has been absent in the past. The money goes directly to the residents of Allston through projects like Arts Bridge, in which professional filmmakers teach Allston teenagers how to make short films about their community.
This community investment is especially important given the long duration of the construction projects in Allston. In February 2009, the university announced that it would delay construction in Allston as part of a series of budget cuts in response to the financial crisis. This slowdown is understandably testing the patience of Allston residents. But goodwill overtures such as the fund indicate that, despite construction uncertainty, Harvard is not wavering in its commitment to a healthy relationship with the Allston community.
Nevertheless, while the grants are a step in the right direction, Harvard’s responsibilities don’t end there. Harvard needs to bring businesses and infrastructure to ensure long-term growth. A well-cited concern of Allston residents is that Harvard will develop over commercial areas—such as the historic Barry’s Corner—without replacing them with equivalent revenue sources. The university still has a duty to show that it recognizes the needs of Allston’s economy. Additionally, it needs consider smaller but still-pressing concerns, such as the problem of rats originating from Harvard construction sites. Allston must remain a good place in which to live and work.
Additionally, Harvard still holds responsibility for connecting the Allston and Cambridge communities; Allston development cannot occur in a bubble. Harvard has already taken certain steps to ensure this. Members of the Allston educational portal were given free passes to Blodgett Pool this past summer, and Allston residents also receive discounted season tickets to Harvard football games. However, Harvard can continue to do more to open up our facilities and share our physical resources as well as our monetary ones.

Are Republicans trying to make President Obama the new Bush? Since the president’s inauguration, it seems as if Republicans have been trying to undermine his legitimacy—not through any substantive criticisms, but by picking on personality tics or superficial characteristics.
Sure, every president is criticized by members of the opposing party for more than just his political positions. George W. Bush was a frequent object of political jest—unlike his father, Bush had difficulty thinking on his feet and frequently fumbled linguistically during his speeches. The bygone Bush era was filled with Bushisms; Jon Stewart and his left-leaning cohorts never had to struggle much for material.
But the recent barbs against Obama are more direct, performative, and cruel than ever. Take the recent outburst from Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who rudely bellowed “You lie!” at the president during his speech to Congress on health care. This behavior might be acceptable during an episode of Jerry Springer, but it shouldn’t fly on Capitol Hill, especially toward the commander-in-chief. Although the congressman later apologized, there are indications that Wilson may have planned his statement; CNN reports that he hinted at it in advance via a Labor Day Twitter feed.
While the most publicized, Wilson’s faux pas is no exception. When President Obama recovered from the shock of Wilson’s behavior and began to speak again, another Republican interrupted by shouting “Not true!” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) was just as disrespectful, wearing a sign sarcastically asking, “What bill?” True, former presidential candidate John McCain (R-Ariz.) and some other Republicans are now condemning Wilson’s outburst. But the dignity of these responses is outweighed by the embarrassing behavior of their colleagues like derisive laughter, applause at intentionally inappropriate moments, and shouts and boos.
The heckling isn’t just limited to senators. In Arlington, Va., protestors held signs: “Obama-cation Dumbing Down Students,’’ read one; “Obamacation. It takes the Village Idiot,” said another. This was eerily reminiscent of a bumper sticker from the Bush years, which read “There’s a village in Texas that’s missing its idiot.” However, the Republican response was ill-timed and counterintuitive. In the aftermath of bloopers like George W.’s “Rarely is the question asked: is our children learning?”, ridicule can work as a tool to damage the credulity of a leader. But when accusations of idiocy follow a politically neutral speech encouraging education, the arrows of insult fall short of their mark.
If Republicans are trying to succeed in creating an aura of disrespect around President Obama in the same way many Democrats did for Bush, they need to resort to a different approach. It’s possible to make fun of President Obama—Saturday Night Live does it quite effectively—but the Republican party’s stunts have only succeeded in making it seem childish, boorish, and even racist. A couple of months ago, for example, a legislative aide to Sen. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) emailed out a picture of previous, white presidents followed by a black portrait with only two oversized eyes portraying Obama—supposedly meant to remind of us of a dark past of Sambo and blackface images. The aide later apologized not for sending a racist email, but for “sending [the e-mail] to the wrong list of people.”My advice for Republicans: Learn from Democratic politicians. Even when they were out of power, they did not heckle Bush, take part in the jests of the masses, or try to create a racial caricature of him. Instead, Democrats offered the credible policy options that gave them a sound victory in 2008. No opposing party ever gained traction without bringing at least one new idea to the table. If Republicans want to challenge the president, garner ideas; trying to publicly humiliate Obama can only backfire. Not only are the means Republicans have been using inappropriate, the end they are seeking to achieve—making a fool of Obama—seems improbable. And besides, “Obama-ism” doesn’t even have a nice ring to it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year the campus’s Fun Czar oversees the planning of the Freshman Formal along with the First Year Social Committee, a group of eager frosh hand-chosen by the fun czar and Freshman Dean’s Office. (Elections for the committee were quietly ended in 2007.) My sophomore year, as vice-chair of the College Events Board, I was lucky enough to chaperone the swanky formal at the Charles Hotel, where freshmen enjoyed an open bar of soft drinks and bottled water. Unfortunately for fun at Harvard, the Fun Czar at the time forgot to request that, at a certain point, the bartenders serve tap water instead of bottled water as had been done historically. Consequently, the Fun Czar herself admitted that the tab for bottled water alone neared half of the original budget for the event and accounted for a significant portion of the social programming budget for all of Harvard’s undergraduates that year. Rather than being fired, the Czarina was asked to remain on U-Hall staff for another year in the Office of Student Life.I mention this disaster not to embarrass the fun czar but rather to highlight the overarching problem with the czarist regime that has been at the heart of every social programming nightmare for the past five years: First-year Harvard graduates are generally ill-equipped to manage the minutiae surrounding oversight of an entire campus’s large-scale social events. From navigating thorny contracts to responsibly allocating a six-figure budget at a notoriously decentralized University, the position’s responsibilities are complex and demanding enough to challenge even a veteran professional event planner.Although the College Events Board and FYSC exist nominally to help the Fun Czar in planning campus-wide events, the Administration empowers the overstretched Czar with real control of all social programming. A case in point: The CEB is not allowed to enter into any contracts surrounding campus events or even have much to do with their scheduling. In years past, they have been told simply that certain events must occur each year, left only to devise the frilly details of the gatherings. The iron fist of social programming is entrusted only to recent Harvard undergraduates, as the administration feels that only a former Harvard student could navigate the complex social and administrative bureaucracies on campus. This “Harvard-only” mentality, I should note, was also espoused by Drew Faust’s adversaries in opposition to her presidential bid. (She never received a degree from Harvard and is, by all accounts, doing just fine.)Insider reasoning and concentration of power might make sense if the Fun Czar were both competent and, well, fun. Unfortunately, the position has gone lately to those who focused primarily on endearing themselves to University Hall staffers during the job hunt. All six of the previous Fun Czars have been white students, and lately they’ve been cut from the Crimson Key/House Committee/Harvard Concert Commission cloth—students who found more delight in the now-defunct Disney Singalong program than they did in increased funding for Yardfest artists. To compound the problem, this general wonkiness has been accompanied by an overarching ineptitude, from mismanaging security contracts to completely ignoring public relations. Since the post pays poorly and requires the fun czar to stay on campus while most friends move on, it seems unlikely that those drawn to apply face a choice between that spacious office in New York and a dank cubby in the basement of University Hall.These shortcomings of competence and diversity are both annual and entrenched, but not impossible to remedy. The administration might try publicizing the position more widely to attract new candidates for the application, or it might move the application deadline from the spring to the fall so that the position would draw interest from students who still have all their options open. It might look outside of the Harvard undergraduate population for a more experienced event planner to hire; the additional salary expenses would be more than offset in money saved by avoiding needless monetary waste. Most radically, University Hall might even begin allowing those undergraduates elected to lead social programming to have some real authority and input in shaping the year’s social calendar. While failure to enact these suggestions might not incite a revolution in the Yard, reevaluating a position that originally stimulated campus social life might combat the torpor that has recently characterized undergraduate involvement in campus-wide events.Benjamin P. Schwartz ’10 is a history and literature concentrator in Winthrop House. He is a former vice-chair of the College Events Board. His column appears on alternate Fridays.

At the end of last month, although I knew the funds in my checking account were running low, I nevertheless chose to pay for lunch with my debit card. I calculated that I had enough left in my account to pay for the $12.87 Fatburger, fries, and lemonade, but, as I would later find out, I was actually short $7.48—I hadn’t adequately accounted for filling up a tank of gas. As a Bank of America customer, however, I was spared the embarrassment of having my card declined because B of A automatically enrolls its clients in an overdraft protection service (you can’t opt out). As a result, I was able to enjoy my lunch courtesy of the fine folks at B of A.But what had originally been a $7.48 overdraft suddenly ballooned into a $77.48 checking account deficit: Because I bought the burger and fries first and the lemonade in a subsequent transaction, I incurred two $35 overdraft fees. There was no sort of alert—the card wasn’t declined, I had no idea. It used to be that banks simply wouldn’t let you overdraft—you either had the money or you didn’t—unless they deemed you to be a reliable customer, in which event they might let it slide without a fee and simply debit your account the next time you made a deposit.That was then. This year, the banking industry will stealthily loot more than $38.5 billion from customers’ checking accounts in “overdraft protection services.” According to a recent New York Times article on the topic, 45 percent of banks in the United States make more in overdraft fees than they do from traditional banking. Seventy-seven percent of big banks in the U.S. now automatically enroll clients in overdraft services, and many, like Bank of America, have made it nearly impossible to opt out.When a bank charges you an overdraft fee, what they’re really doing is charging you interest on a loan. To pay for my burger, I effectively had to “borrow” $7.48 for a cost of $70. Banks, however, would prefer that neither their clients nor regulators interpret this transaction as a sort of loan. If they are loans, then they become subject to the Truth in Lending Act. The TLA stipulates that lenders have to disclose to the borrowers the interest rate they’re charging on an annualized basis. If overdraft protection fell under the act’s purview, banks would be forced to get clients’ approval before enrolling them in an overdraft program. This is why, in 2004, banks strong-armed the Federal Reserve into saying that overdraft protection was a service, not a loan, effectively exempting overdraft charges from TLA regulations.Assuming that we think of overdraft fees as loans, though, what does the interest rate come out to? It all depends on the size of the overdraft and your bank’s fee. According to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation study, if you were to overdraft your account by $20 and incur a modest $27 fee that you paid back two weeks later, you would be paying an annualized interest rate of 3,520 percent. In my case, that number turned out to be much higher. (B of A charges $35, the industry average, up from $10 in 1999.)Now, I hear the argument that we all ought to be more financially responsible, and that this problem could be avoided by only spending what we have in our bank accounts. But if that’s the case, then shouldn’t banks give you the choice of having overdraft services in the first place? The issue here is not one of financial irresponsibility on the part of individuals, but of predatory and opaque practices by the banks. Consider that, as reported in the FDIC survey, 93 percent of overdraft fees are being paid by only 14 percent of bank customers. My guess is that Warren Buffett probably doesn’t overdraft his checking account very often, so that 14 percent represents a different slice of American society.Pressure from legislators, together with a string of negative press, prompted B of A and Chase to announce on Tuesday that they would redesign their overdraft programs, giving customers greater flexibility, including the choice to deactivate overdraft services. This is an admittedly positive development, but it is also a barefaced attempt to stanch the regulatory wave before it breaks. The fact remains that the banking industry, even B of A and Chase, will continue to rely heavily on revenue from overdraft services because most people don’t have the time or the stomach for the aggravation of overdrafts, which are often just the result of the bank taking too long to credit your deposits. Most people just let it slide and consider it a cost of their overly busy days. And that’s just how banks make money. And for a variety of reasons—information overload for consumers, concentration of market share—the market hasn’t been able to sort it all out. Absent real regulation, the burden will continue to fall on the shoulders of the middle and working classes.Clay A. Dumas ’10, a former Crimson associate editorial editor, is a social studies concentrator in Lowell House.

Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr.’s name has emerged as one of the top candidates to fill Edward M. Kennedy’s ’54-’56 Senate seat in media reports, even as speculation swirled late last night that Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 would instead pick Paul G. Kirk Jr. '60, a longtime friend of Kennedy’s, as a stand-in for the late liberal senator.
According to media reports, Patrick is slated to announce his choice as early as tomorrow. The decision has garnered heightened scrutiny and pressure from Congressional Democrats who fear that a Senate majority without a vote from Kennedy’s former seat may not be sufficient to pass health-care reform.
The Massachusetts Senate approved a bill yesterday to authorize Patrick to appoint an interim Senator until a permanent successor can be chosen by special election. In what was seen as an effort to bolster Democratic efforts to pass a health-care reform package, Kennedy requested in the weeks before his death that the state legislature act to amend the law to allow for an interim successor to be put in place immediately after his death.
In addition to Kirk and Ogletree, media speculation points to former Lieutenant Governor Evelyn Murphy and former Governor Michael Dukakis as other potential candidates.
The Boston Globe reported yesterday that Kennedy’s widow, Victoria Kennedy, and his two sons, U.S. Representative Patrick J. Kennedy and Edward M. Kennedy Jr., have informed Patrick that Kirk, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is their first choice.
Senator Kennedy’s successor will serve until a permanent replacement is selected during a Jan. 19 special election.
Yesterday, Ogletree received a ringing endorsement from colleagues at the Law School who praised his qualities as a potential senator.
Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe—a friend of Ogletree’s and a mentor to President Obama during his time at the Law School—said Ogletree would make an excellent replacement for Kennedy.
Tribe declined to comment as to whether he thought Ogletree was interested in the position, saying only that “[Ogletree] has said publicly that he is committed to the work that he is doing with the Hamilton Institute and that he has no other interests.”
But Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz offered a far less restrained assessment yesterday.
“It would be the most wonderful thing imaginable!” he said. “‘Tree’ would be a most distinguished senator—he brings every conceivable talent to bear: he’s brilliant, he’s politically sophisticated, and he has a heart of gold.”
As to whether Ogletree is interested in the position, Dershowitz said he could only hope that he would be willing to take on the role.
“I remember Ted Kennedy when he was Ogletree’s age,” Dershowitz said. “And I can’t imagine anyone more similar to Kennedy in his commitment to the public interest.”
Ogletree could not be reached for comment.
Patrick is expected to announce his decision sometime today or tomorrow, according to media reports, but the decision seems to still be pending. The Governor’s office issued a statement yesterday denying that a successor has been chosen.

The three men accused of participating in the murder of Cambridge resident Justin Cosby in Kirkland House last spring are now all in custody in Massachusetts.
Blayn Jiggetts, 20, and Jason Aquino, 23, were arraigned in Middlesex Superior District Court in Woburn yesterday and ordered held without bail.
Jiggetts is charged with first degree murder, accessory after the fact of murder, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm, according to a press release from the Middlesex District Attorney’s office. 
Aquino faces charges of accessory after the fact of armed robbery and carrying a firearm without a license—murder charges against Aquino were dropped Tuesday. 
Jiggetts and Aquino have pleaded not guilty in connection with the murder. 
Both men were previously held without bail in New York.
The third defendant, Jabrai J. Copney, 20, has been in custody in Massachusetts since May 21. He was indicted on June 26 by a Middlesex Superior Court Grand Jury on counts of first degree murder, accessory after the fact of murder, attempt to commit a crime, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm.
Cosby was shot in the basement of Kirkland House on May 18. Aquino, Copney, and Jiggetts—none of whom are Harvard students—allegedly planned to rob Cosby during an arranged meeting in the basement of Kirkland’s J-entryway. 
Jiggetts pulled out a gun and a struggle ensued as Cosby tried to flee, according to the police investigation.  Jiggetts handed the gun to Copney, who fired three shots, one of which hit and killed Cosby.
The three men took a bus from South Station to New York City later that evening.
Former Harvard students Brittany J. Smith and Chanequa N. Campbell, both originally members of the class of 2009, were linked to the murder but have not been charged criminally. 
Neither student received a diploma last spring.
The investigation by the Harvard University Police, Cambridge Police, and the Massachusetts State Police is still ongoing.

Although the number of Reserve Officers’ Training Corps students on college campuses is increasing nationwide, enrollment in Harvard’s ROTC—which has long had a contentious relationship with the University—has remained flat.Most of the 273 colleges and universities officially associated with ROTC have reported growth in their Army programs this year, according to the Associated Press.Air Force ROTC Captain Joseph P. Adelmann, an instructor in aerospace studies at MIT, said that the increases may be due to the draw of ROTC scholarships and the current state of the job market.“I know in the past few years we’ve seen some increase from what [the numbers] had been previously,” Adelmann said. “Part of that could be due to the economy, could be the job security thing after college, because it’s harder to get jobs these days.”While MIT has followed the trend of increased enrollment, Harvard ROTC—which trains as part of MIT’s program—has not followed suit.In 2006, Harvard students made up 15 out of the 49 Army ROTC students participating in the MIT program, according to Lt. Colonel Timothy Hall, the department head of Army ROTC at MIT. This year, Harvard students make up 15 out of 86.Paul E. Mawn ’63, the chairman of Advocates for Harvard ROTC, said that this trend could be due, at least in part, to the College’s decision to withdraw official recognition of the program in the 1960s.Beginning in 1969, Harvard students who wanted to enroll in ROTC had to trek to Kendall Square to train and to take ROTC courses at MIT. Harvard does not give degree credit for these courses, nor does it provide financial support for ROTC programs.The College’s current Student Handbook outlines Harvard’s official stance on the issue, as well as its reasons for not recognizing the program.“Current federal policy of excluding known lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals from admission to ROTC or of discharging them from service is inconsistent with Harvard’s values as stated in its policy on discrimination,” the handbook states.But Mawn said that changes were needed to help people develop different attitudes on the issue. “People who have no connection to the military have been fed all this anti-military propaganda for years,” he said, adding that today’s media has very few positive things to say about the military. “If there was a space on campus where interested Harvard students could go to understand what the military is all about, maybe [the ROTC] could explain and give them the chance to understand. That would be helpful.”Shawna L. Sinnott ’10, the Vice President of the Harvard ROTC Association, agreed that Harvard’s policy was partly to blame for the flat enrollment.“Because of Harvard’s de-recognition of the program, people don’t think Harvard is an option if they want to pursue a military career,” she said.But Sinnott also said that the current Harvard administration seems to be more accepting of ROTC.“[University President Drew G.] Faust has been a lot more receptive,” she said. “We’re making baby steps; it’s not the same closed-door policy we’ve had with the administration in the past.”

Matt Hubbard ’00 took home an Emmy for Best Writing for his work on the hit comedy series 30 Rock on Sunday night.His episode, “Reunion,” beat out three other episodes of 30 Rock to win the award on a night in which the show was nominated for awards 22 times.Kentaro Fujita ’00, who was Hubbard’s freshman year roommate in Thayer and is now a professor at the Ohio State University, said that he was happy to hear the news but not surprised.“Matt [Hubbard] was one of those guys who always liked to laugh,” Fujita said. “He had sort of a charm to him and a glint in his eye. I’m not surprised he did so well for himself.”During his time at Harvard, Hubbard wrote for the Harvard Crimson and comped the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.He joins other prominent Harvard and Lampoon alumni, including Conan O’Brien ’85 and Simon Rich ’07, who were each nominated for awards at this year’s Emmy’s.Both were former presidents of the Harvard Lampoon. O’Brien was nominated for his writing on his own comedy show “Late Night With Conan O’Brien,” and Rich for his work on Saturday Night Live.30 Rock, which was created by Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Tina Fey, has earned critical and commercial acclaim since the pilot episode aired in October 2006. The cast includes Fey, Tracy Morgan, and Alec Baldwin.Perhaps as a testament to its success, 30 Rock took home the Best Comedy Series award for the third year in a row.Hubbard has written and produced for the show since 2007 and made his way around the television world with writing credits for other programs including “Joey,” “Ed,” and the surprise anime hit “Avatar: The Last Airbender.” As a History and Literature concentrator, Hubbard wrote his senior thesis on the television show, “All in the Family.” When Hubbard—then a senior—was asked by the Crimson about what he would do after completing his thesis, he replied that he would probably watch a lot of TV, though not “All in the Family.”Hubbard could not be reached for comment yesterday.

Four Harvard Law School professors signed a statement in support of the defendant in a case regarding executive pay that will be heard by the Supreme Court next week.In the case, Jones et al. v. Harris Associates, several mutual fund investors charged that the fund had overpaid its advisors. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago dismissed a full court rehearing of the lawsuit in May 2008.Law professors John C. Coates, Robert C. Clark, Allen Ferrell, and J. Mark Ramseyer signed an amicus brief earlier this month in support of the defendant, Harris Associates, along with more than 20 other corporate law and finance professors. According to Coates, the brief agrees with Seventh Circuit Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook’s ruling that the court should not be involved in determining the compensation of investment advisors. Coates said he was motivated in part to contribute to the amicus brief because his research on competition in the mutual fund industry had been incorporated into several earlier briefings in the case. “I didn’t think the research I had worked on was presented fairly in the other briefs,” Coates said. “I wanted to make sure the Supreme Court understood what the research out there really meant.”The case has caught the spotlight in the legal community because of public discussion surrounding executive pay. But even if the Supreme Court were to overturn the Seventh Circuit’s decision and side with the shareholders—which could hold symbolic meaning—the implications of the case are limited because the law is only applicable to mutual funds, said Coates and Ramseyer.The case also sparked an extremely rare disagreement between Easterbrook and Judge Richard A. Posner, who typically vote together, according to Ramseyer. Easterbrook sided with the majority, saying that fee levels should be determined by the market, while Posner—who wrote a dissent—argued that compensation has become excessive and the courts should intervene.According to Coates, lower courts that have affirmed shareholder complaints have asserted that mutual funds rates are not determined by the market and should thus be externally regulated because the funds do not compete with each other. “Mutual funds are often in price wars,” Coates said. “Courts should not turn a blind eye [to the competition between funds]. ““Courts ought to look at this competition no matter what the [Supreme Court’s] decision is.”

While Dean of the Office of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said as recently as Monday that the College administration had “no answers” concerning several major issues related to House renovation, a Graduate School of Design class is providing its own vision for Harvard’s future Houses—and often with an avant-garde twist.The College is currently in the design phase of its large-scale House renewal project—the most extensive renovation of the College’s nine river and three Quad Houses, which will total an estimated $1 billion.  A second-year GSD course entitled “The Core Studio” provides masters of architecture students with an academic exercise emphasizing the practical considerations of architecture in “politics and real life,” according to Stephen Y.M. Fan ’04-’06. One of the main projects the class considers is House renewal.A graduate student in the course, Fan coordinated a discussion for the class on House renovations Monday that included a panel of undergraduates, resident tutors, and alumni. The discussion, like the class in general, aimed to simulate “professional aspects of the field,” including the process of consulting a client.As far as swing housing—one unresolved issue of House renewal—is concerned, the panel fielded proposals ranging from constructing temporary residential facilities in front of Lowell House, to constructing these facilities in the Church Street parking lot, to even building swing housing on top of the Quincy House dining hall.Fan conceded that several of his peers’ proposals were “radical,” in part because they did not have to take budget concerns into account in their hypothetical recommendations.“The issues that are raised may shed new light on the way people in the University think about their roles and own proposals,” said Design School Professor Jonathan Levi, who teaches the class.   Remeike J.B. Forbes ’11, one of six Dudley House undergraduates who participated in the panel, said the Dudley Co-op could serve as a model for what alternative housing at Harvard could entail. Residents of the Co-op communally prepare food and share chores,Still, Forbes added that his “sense is that the House system wouldn’t change significantly. It will be more or less the same” after renovations—which Nelson said Monday would start in 2012—are complete.Echoing suggestions proposed in the House Renewal Report—a 112-page document of wide-ranging residential recommendations released by the College administration in April—the GSD students also noted the need to bolster House interactions via neighborhood-wide facilities. Though the class is not advising the College administration on House renovations in a professional capacity, Fan said College administrators will be present when the GSD students deliver their final projects at the end of the semester.—Staff writer Bita M.

History Professor Caroline Elkins was awarded tenure on July 1 after eight years as an associate professor of African Studies at Harvard. Elkins said she first discovered a “passion” for African history when she took a course on the subject as an undergraduate at Princeton. She said she is drawn to the subject because it provides an “intellectual challenge” and involves “thinking outside the box” to understand the “confluence of so many areas of history.”“It is impossible to study the history of Europe or America without considering the influence of Africa,” Elkins said. “It is an incredibly valuable subject for young students.”In 2006, Elkins was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for her book “Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain’s Gulag in Kenya,” which “realigned historians’ understanding of the final years of colonial Kenya,” Dean of Social Science Stephen M. Kosslyn said in a press release announcing Elkins’ tenure. Elkins collected much of the information contained in the book from oral histories of Kenyan survivors of British detention camps in the 1950s and wrote the book during a yearlong stay at the Radcliffe Institute between 2003 and 2004. Her research interests include “colonial violence and post-conflict reconciliation in Africa, and violence and the decline of the British Empire,” according to her history department Web site.Elkins is currently teaching both Historical Study A-21: “Africa and Africans: The Making of a Continent in the Modern World” and History 2709: “Themes in Modern Sub-Saharan African History: Proseminar.”She will also teach another course in the spring. “Being in her classroom is an incredibly exciting experience. She balances being a challenging professor with being an understanding and encouraging mentor,” said Meghan A. Shutzer ’10, a social studies concentrator who took two courses taught by Elkins. “I think she brings the best out of her students. I wanted to go to her class every day,” she added.Elkins describes her own classes as “engaging.” She said she makes all of her classes, even lectures, dialogues between herself and her students and that classes are often a learning experience for her. For Elkins, she noted that the best part of being a professor is “inspiring students to pursue their interests in Africa.”“Teaching at Harvard and winning a Pulitzer Prize have both been humbling experiences,” Elkins said. “I have been surrounded by so many wonderful people...I am very lucky.”

Michael L. Best, a faculty associate of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, opened the “Communication in Human Development: The Freedom Connection” event last night by reaching into his pocket to retrieve his cell phone. He flipped the device open and said, “Hello? Mom? I told you I had an event tonight!” and consequently sparked a discussion about the role of technology in advanced countries and the developing world.The event was sponsored by the International Development Research Center, an organization that has pioneered the use of technology as agents for reducing poverty, combating disease, and fostering good governance through global engagement.The afternoon’s discussion was guided by Best, who moderated the event, and a group of panelists including two Nobel Prize winning economics professors, Harvard’s Amartya K. Sen and Stanford’s A. Michael Spence. They were joined by Law School Professor Yochai Benkler and Clotilde Fonseca, a Founding Director of the National Program of Educational Informatics in Costa Rica.While much of the discussion centered around how technology could be deployed as a tool in international development, some time was also devoted to a range of issues including economic competition and regulation, policy implications of technology, climate control, and technological fluency.“You are either a part of the technological community or you are left out,” Fonseca told the audience. “The digital divide is also a cognitive divide about the capacity to solve problems in your community.”The panelists eagerly took on difficult issues such as the need for a focus on gender in development practices, and the role of the “food first, freedom later” doctrine of society building.“As a student of economics, I always wonder about the mechanics of the technological process,” said Gerardo A. Flores ’11, who worked as a programmer in a developing country this summer. “It’s awesome to have people who have thought hard about these issues in one room, and see how it plays out.”Although the panelists doubted some facets of the technological explosion, all expressed some hope that technology could act as a catalyst for advancement in the developing world.

Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 announced yesterday that Paul G.
Kirk Jr. ’60, a former aide to Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, will fill the
late U.S. senator’s seat until a special election is held in January.
Kirk, a longtime family friend who served as a special
assistant to Kennedy for eight years, is scheduled to take the oath of
office today. Kennedy’s successor will serve until a permanent
replacement is selected in an election on Jan. 19—a race in which Kirk,
71, said he will not participate.
“He shares the sense of service that so distinguished Senator
Kennedy,” Patrick said yesterday during a news conference in Boston.
“The interests of the commonwealth have never been more vital or at
stake in the Congress today.”
Kirk’s appointment closes the door on far-flung speculation
regarding Patrick’s choice for a successor to Kennedy, who died of
brain cancer last month. News of the impending appointment gained
widespread attention—especially among some Congressional Democrats—as
the move to speedily fill Kennedy’s seat was seen as a concerted effort
to ensure the passage of a health-care reform package.
In a statement released after the announcement of Kirk’s
appointment, President Barack Obama said he was “pleased” that the
Mass. Senate contingent will be complete in a time when issues such as
health care, financial reform, and energy are undergoing heated debate.
Kirk was rumored to be the favored candidate, with the Boston
Globe reporting Wednesday that Kennedy’s widow, Victoria Kennedy, and
his two sons, U.S. Representative Patrick J. Kennedy and Edward M.
Kennedy Jr., had informed the governor that Kirk—a former chairman of
the Democratic National Committee—was their first choice.
Before the announcement yesterday morning, Patrick’s staff
circulated a list of talking points that called Kirk a “faithful
steward” of the Senate seat with a “strong reputation as a person of
character, high integrity and honesty.”
Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe said Kirk, a 1964
graduate of the Law School, will be a “tremendous” Senator whose close
affiliation with Kennedy and his political vision will enable Kirk to
assume his new responsibilities “without missing a beat.” “[Kirk] has a very good sense of policy, he has a terrific
sense of humor, he’s very adept at political negotiation, and he’s a
very affable person,” Tribe said. “I think he will do very well in
building coalitions to the extent that it’s possible in that brief a
time.”
The Massachusetts Senate approved a bill Wednesday to
authorize Patrick to appoint a temporary replacement, in accordance
with Kennedy’s request that
the legislature change the law to permit Patrick to select an interim
Senator in the event of his death, until a special election could be
held.
In addition to Kirk, names that had been circulated in the
press included former Mass. Governor and 1988 presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis, former Mass. Lieutenant Governor Evelyn Murphy, and
Harvard Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr.—Staff writer Esther I. Yi can be reached at estheryi@fas.harvard.edu.

People who want to work more efficiently should actually work less, according to the findings of a study released by the Harvard Business Review. Leslie A. Perlow, a professor of leadership at the Business School and the lead author on the study, worked closely with several offices of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) over the course of four years. The researchers mandated “predictable time off” for employees to determine whether or not change was possible in the “always-on” culture of the American workplace. Though Perlow said she did not have definite expectations when she launched the study, the results—increased communication among employees, better planning and streamlining of tasks, and in some instances, enhanced customer service—were positive.“What surprised me was the power of such a small change,” she said. “In order to have predictable nights off, team members had to work together to rethink core assumptions about how they worked.”While the study demonstrated positive benefits from increased time away from employment, the new approach to work was a difficult transition for some employees.“Anytime you change an organization and how people do their work, it’s uncomfortable,” said Debbie Lovich, the head of BCG’s consulting staff and head of one of twelve teams of employees observed in the study. “People are used to working in a certain way. With Leslie’s experiment, she asked us really to behave differently and that took a while to get used to.”The results come as no surprise to proponents of increased time away from employment, such as John de Graaf, national coordinator and founder of Take Back Your Time, an initiative to combat overwork and over-scheduling. “I am not surprised because it is clear that these kinds of things, periodic breaks, are useful to people’s health and are beneficial to productivity in the long run,” de Graaf said. He also said that the results of this study may apply to students, too.“Students at Harvard are preparing for careers in which creativity is essential,” de Graaf said. “They need time to reflect and refocus. Our culture’s constant demand and “now-now” pressures don’t give them these sorts of breaks.” While Perlow acknowledged that the study’s results could be superficially applied to Harvard students, she said that the greater implications related to how teams can work together more effectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Summer 2009 has come to a close, and peaceful East Cambridge, Mass. is once again flooded with driven, eager pupils donning crimson wherever they go. 
Despite being sprinkled across the globe for the last three months, Harvard students—some doctoring children and others doctoring spreadsheets—have remained connected in spirit. Regardless of where our days outside the bubble were spent, we faced situations where we had to defend Harvard from ridicule.
“Do you even have parties? What do you do at them, drink 5-Hour Energy shots and worry?”
“I think I’m gonna pick up some new gear from that Harvard Yard clothing line...LMAO!”
“Sports? Please...You go to Harvard.”
That’s where many of us draw the line—especially Harvard football fans. When we hear those words, whether we are casual or die-hard, our tongues are quickly mobilized as we fire off standout surnames. Ten years ago, it was Birk. Five years ago, Fitzpatrick. Then the illustrious Dawson. Football stars who made it from the Crimson’s biggest stage to the Sunday night lights of the National Football League. 
Recite these names, or even the more recent standouts in many other Harvard sports, sprinkle in some training camp hopefuls, and you can name drop when your condescending ACC friends try to clown you.
Harvard sports teams may not send half of their starting lineups to pro drafts with designer suits and iced-out watches bought with dirty money, but we always have one athlete to hold on to. And sometimes, all you need is one.
It’s time to add another name to our list. 
Harvard football defensive tackle Desmond Bryant ’09 closed out this summer by earning a spot on the Oakland Raiders’ main roster. 
At a startlingly trim 6’6, 290 lbs, Bryant has a build that is a presence even in the NFL. 
“We’re very proud of Desmond,” said Harvard football coach Tim Murphy. “[He] came to Harvard as a lean, raw football player with tremendous physical ability and potential. But through hard work and perseverance, he’s still improving, and he’s proved he can play at the highest level.” 
Bryant is not the first to “make it,” but one of many. What Harvard sports fans have not seen recently in their NFL-bound peers’ careers is longevity. In 2007, Crimson running back Clifton Dawson ’07, the Ivy League’s all-time leading rusher, entered the NFL with the Indianapolis Colts. Dawson—now a free agent—had 64 carries in his two active years in the NFL, and escorted the football across the sacred goal line and into the Promised Land one glorious time. 
For Bryant, one is the number to beat.
He recorded his first tackle in the pros just five days ago, in the Raiders’ 13-10 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Surely he will accumulate more, hopefully starting Sunday. But the key for him will be to light up his stats with ones across the board. One tackle leads to one sack, which leads to one forced fumble, one recovery, and so on.
“People get so caught up in what he is physically that they forget about what he is as a football player and what he brings to the field,” said Harvard football captain Carl Ehrlich. “Wherever he is, he’s going to find a way to get to the top.” 
Many Harvard players have made the jump, but few have lasted. The exception is former Harvard center Matt R. Birk ’98, who spent 10 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, including five Pro Bowl seasons. He recently signed a three-year, eight-figure deal with the Baltimore Ravens. 
Then there’s former Harvard quarterback Ryan J. Fitzpatrick ’05, who is entering his fifth NFL season as a backup for the Buffalo Bills.
Let’s slow down a bit here. I’m not saying that no Harvard athlete makes his or her alma mater and schoolmates proud unless they play pro until their knees erode and their wallets explode. They will all do great things regardless of their professional careers. 
Rather, I’m just making a plug for those close-to-home, “I knew him” heroes, through whom some of us live vicariously. We, like millions of other college students, will soon enter the professional world and bestow our brain power upon some sector of it. As wonderful as that is, many of us wish that our agility could match our analytical skills. We champion the few who’ve got both. 
Bryant, who was unavailable for comment, has a few things going for him right now. For one, he got significant playing time in the second half this past weekend, which is essential for starting a successful career. More importantly, perhaps, he has a support system. According to blogs on the Raiders’ fan site, notoriously rowdy Oakland fans agree that Bryant is a versatile, promising prospect.
Time will tell if Bryant can set himself further apart from his predecessors. There’s no point in speculating further. He, and perhaps we, must take it one down at a time.

The No. 6 Harvard men’s soccer team (6-0-0) knocked off New Hampshire, 1-0, yesterday afternoon in Durham, N.H. to preserve its perfect record ahead of the much-anticipated matchup with No. 3 Wake Forest this weekend. The kicker: according to Crimson coach Jamie Clark, the team didn’t even play well.“Today’s game was a worry for the whole team,” Clark said. “Just getting through the game was a victory…It is nice to know that we’re finding a way to win and build confidence even when we’re not playing our best.”That confidence will be important on Saturday against the Demon Deacons, the highest ranked team Harvard has faced yet. Aside from a 1-0 loss to Virginia last week, the ACC squad has dominated its conference and is a major player on the national level.With last night’s win over the Wildcats (2-4-1), however, the Crimson overcame another hurdle before the match against the powerhouse from North Carolina.“It was a tough game,” co-captain Andre Akpan said. “It was not the greatest field or environment, and we played against big and physical players, but we came out to win.”And win it did.The team was propelled by a 60th-minute goal from freshman forward Brian Rogers off of an assist from senior midfielder Adam Rousmaniere. Rogers has recorded four goals this season, including two game-winning scores, legitimizing his role as an up-and-coming offensive threat.“Brian Rogers is a young player who has stepped in and been the guy beside Andre [Akpan] to contribute to our offense,” Clark said. “He does not get all the press, but he is a huge force on the field.”Another key contributor in yesterday’s game was sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms, who recorded his third shutout of the season. Harms broke into the starting 11 last year as a freshman and has been a major reason for the undefeated start to the year. Harms made three saves to preserve the victory. But Harms was far from alone in keeping New Hampshire off the scoresheet. The Crimson has allowed only two goals this season and has retained the philosophy that a stellar defense will win games. Harms did not face a shot on goal in the entire second half.The solid performance at the back was vital given Harvard’s inability to really get into gear offensively.“We knew it was going to be a battle going in,” Rousmaniere said. “[New Hampshire] was an athletic team and made gaining an advantage difficult, but Rogers had a nice finish and the team has definitely gained a lot of momentum for Saturday’s match.”Facing a fellow top-10 team will be a big test for the Crimson.“This weekend, it is two teams trying to show each other who is better,” Clark said. “It is a huge game for our team and our season.”“The team has been looking forward to this game for a while,” Rousmaniere said. “Wake is a great team and a good test for us. We’re ready to head down.”For now, however, it is satisfying just to enjoy another victory.

First losses plague the Ancient Eight’s elite, Foreseen victors not keen to fall again. Redeem the polls by rising to thy feet. What says Harvard, what says Brown, what says Penn? A dark horse lurks somewhere among the pack, Ready to pounce should others start to fail. Which New York Ivy eyes the title track? Or shall the big surprise arise from Yale? Alas, there’s one more question left to touch: Not if Dartmouth will lose, but by how much? My apologies to Bill Shakespeare, who just found out that turning over in one’s grave is more uncomfortable than you’d think. Let’s make some football picks for Week 2. CORNELL (1-0) AT YALE (1-0) The Bulldogs and the Big Red will take the field at the Yale Bowl tomorrow fresh off of trouncing Patriot League foes Georgetown and Bucknell, respectively. While neither team is seen as a frontrunner for an Ivy title, one will walk away from this game with both momentum and a head start in the Ancient Eight race. Yale’s new quarterback Patrick Witt—brother of former Harvard signal caller Jeff—was a model of efficiency in Week 1, going 22-for-27 with 216 yards and 2 touchdowns. He’ll have to sort some things out with his linemen, though, after getting sacked six times. As for Cornell, I might owe the Big Red an apology. In last week’s column, I mocked the team for playing the guy who “might be [its] best quarterback,” Stephen Liuzza, at wide receiver while the untested Ben Ganter lined up behind center. Well, Ganter managed Cornell’s offense adequately against Bucknell while Liuzza showed why it’s not smart to pigeon-hole him into one position—he rushed five times for 71 yards and a touchdown, caught two passes for 11 yards, and even threw a nine-yard completion. Prediction: Yale 24, Cornell 17 DARTMOUTH (0-1) AT NO. 7 NEW HAMPSHIRE (2-0) It’s no secret to the four of you who regularly read this column that I derive a certain degree of sadistic pleasure from making fun of Dartmouth football. But when I see injustice in the world, I feel compelled to stand up and say something. To whoever scheduled the Big Green to play against the seventh-ranked team in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly Division 1-AA), does your cruelty know no bounds? I refuse to believe that Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens was behind this because he seems like a really nice guy. But somewhere out there, someone pitched the idea of making this game happen, whispering sweet nothings about intrastate rivalries and it being “good for the fans.” In addressing this person, I cite yet another Bard—Sir William Ferrell from his seminal work, “Good Cop, Baby Cop”: “I don’t know who blackened your soul a long time ago, but may God have mercy on it.” Prediction: New Hampshire 48, Dartmouth 7 COLUMBIA (1-0) VS. CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE (1-1) Last season, the book on Columbia was “Great Defense, Non-Existent Offense.” The team only won one game (guess who they beat), but the groundwork for a successful program was ther

Any avid “Man vs. Wild” fan will recite that an animal is often the most dangerous when it is hurt. The Harvard women’s soccer team, roughed up in preseason and with a record to show it, comes out tomorrow against the University of Pennsylvania with an injured pride and a thirst for redemption.  
The Crimson will face off this weekend at Ohiri field against a powerful Quaker team that, in its previous game, scored three goals in just over eight minutes to salvage a 3-3 tie against Georgetown University. 
This weekend marks the Ivy League opener for Penn (3-1-2) and Harvard (1-5-1). Both teams look to start their Ancient Eight schedules off on the right foot, working towards the automatic entry into the NCAA tournament that accompanies an Ivy League crown. 
The Crimson experienced an undeniably rocky start to the season. Since its victory over UNH on Sept. 8, the team has dropped four straight games throughout which it has scored a meager three goals–the same number that Penn forward Jessica Fuccello put up in her team’s last game. 
The disappointing ratio of L’s to W’s comes as a bit of a surprise. Last year the team boasted 10 wins and claimed the Ivy League championship before heading on to NCAA’s. And that was no fluke: Harvard witnessed the same number of victories in 2007. 
The past two weeks, Harvard fell consecutively to Long Beach State, Hofstra, then No.-14 Boston College, and Boston University. The women’s squad dropped its most recent contest, 1-0 to the latter team in a defensive battle in which the Crimson mustered only one shot. 
“We’re putting that behind us,” said third-year head coach Ray Leone. “In my mind, we’re starting 0-0.” 
Leone also sees Harvard’s past losses as a learning opportunity.
“The games were worthwhile and hopefully have prepared us for a tough Ivy League schedule,” Leone said. 
As opposed to Harvard, the Quakers have had an impressive start to their season, tallying 14 goals over six games and losing only once to Northwestern. Senior forward Jessica Fuccello, who scored all three goals in Penn’s comeback last Sunday, spearheads the Quaker offense. Fuccello has outmaneuvered opposing goalies eight times and has been voted Ivy League Player of the Week for two of the past three weeks.  
“They’ve got excellent players at every single position,” Leone said. “They’ve had a great start.” 
While Harvard is well aware of the competency of its opponent, the team refuses to dwell on it. 
“We’re all focusing more on ourselves than on Penn,” co-captain Lizzy Nichols said. “We need to have more confidence going into the game.” 
The Crimson is also looking to reverse a recent losing trend against the Quakers, as Penn has come out on top in each of the past two years. In last year’s Ivy League opener, the Quakers triumphed over the Crimson in a 2-0 shutout. 
“We’re all looking forward to starting the Ivy League season,” Nichols said. “We’re going into this week of training really positive. It’s just about finding that attitude to win.” 
For Penn, the challenge will be in bypassing senior goalie Lauren Mann, who had a season-high 12 saves against BC on Sept. 18, raising her career total to 252–good for fifth on Harvard’s all-time save list. 
Junior forward Katherine Sheeleigh, who leads the Harvard scorers with two goals and one assist, and freshman forward Caroline Albanese, who has two goals of her own, will prove a threat to Penn as well. 
After a week of practice, Leone and Harvard look to rebound from their losses and rack up a much-needed win in an early yet still significant matchup.
“I’m looking forward to our team coming out with a lot of energy and excitement to start a new Ivy League season,” Leone said.

Harvard students often save the fanatical football fan in them for Harvard-Yale, but there’s no need to wait for November for a fierce rivalry. Tonight, the Crimson (0-1) faces Brown, with whom they shared last year’s Ivy League title. The Bears (1-0) handed Harvard its only loss last season, stopping a two-point conversion attempt that would have tied the game in the final minute.
“They do a good job with their scheme, they’re well coached, and they’re hungry,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They’re like anybody else, they love to play Harvard. So it will be another battle for sure.”
The most intriguing match-up of the game is between Brown’s defensive line and Harvard’s triple punch at running back. 
“They like putting a lot of people in the box to stop the run,” said senior running back Cheng Ho. “They want to make us beat them with our passing game...We want to establish the running game, control the tempo of the game, control the clock.”
Going against a Bears D that boasts nine seniors—including James Develin and David Howard, who at 6’3, 290 earned himself a preseason All-American nod and pro looks—and two juniors, the Crimson offense will likely have its hands full.
“This is the same team that led the Ivy League in rushing defense a year ago,” Murphy said. “So that’ll be our biggest challenge offensively.” 
Responding to that challenge will be junior Gino Gordon, freshman Treavor Scales, as well as Ho. Gordon and Ho were named second-team All Ivy in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Scales averaged 4.4 yards per carry in the season opener against Holy Cross. 
“For the first time in a long time, we’ve got a lot of depth there,” Murphy said. “And to get through this season, I think we’re going to need them all to be successful.”
Last year, Brown managed to curb Harvard’s run, shutting down Gordon’s push to put his team over the top in the Crimson’s final possession.
But even if the Bears force Harvard to air the ball out, the receiving corps is ready to step up according to junior receiver Marco Iannuzzi.
“We have six guys who can play at any moment,” Iannuzzi said. “It’s probably a strain on the coaches in terms of who’s going to go in. But for the players it’s great because we get to have fresh legs.” 
Leading the pack is senior standout Matt Luft, a preseason All-American who racked up 875 yards last season.
But the question still remains whether or not junior quarterback Collier Winters can get the ball to those receivers.
“I guess he’s new to starting, but he got a lot of reps last year, and he’s not that new to the team,” Iannuzzi said. “He’s been making great decisions.”
But going into tonight’s contest, Brown finds itself in a similar situation.
All-Ivy receivers Buddy Farnham and Bobby Sewall combined for 1,764 yards last year and make up the biggest threats, provided that new quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero can run an efficient passing game.
After Michael Dougherty, the Bears’ previous quarterback and semifinalist for the Draddy Award (which Peyton Manning won in college), Newhall-Caballero is fairly untested but connected with Farnham for 121 yards on 12 catches in the team’s opening loss to Stony Brook.
Farnham and Sewell will have to contend with the Crimson’s strong secondary of Derrick Barker, Ryan Barnes, Matthew Hanson, and Collin Zych. Cornerbacks Barker and Hanson have both been named preseason All-Americans, and Hanson was the 2008 Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Barnes recorded 50 tackles last season, and Zych was named to the this year’s preseason All-Ivy team. 
“They’re lockdown kind of guys,” captain Carl Ehrlich said. “We have a really good defensive backfield.”
As both teams take the field under the Friday night lights, they do so with question marks up and down their depth charts. The defending co-Ivy League champions are a far cry from their title teams, but both are looking to make headway in this Ivy schedule opener.

Students heading to Harvard Hillel tomorrow may find themselves on national TV—in Korea. Of all visitors to campus, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) will be in town tomorrow to film a roundtable discussion at Hillel in which students share their experiences as American Jewish college students with Korea’s foremost public television station, which is creating a documentary on Jewish life in America.
Hillel Associate Director Michael Simon said he was contacted by KBS this summer. “This was an unusual request, so we were intrigued,” he said.  He was even more impressed when he realized that the intern who called him had stayed up until 2 a.m. in Korea in order to be able to call him at a reasonable time in America.
Hillel’s leaders were excited about the chance to share the “diverse expressions in the Jewish tradition” with audiences across the world, so they decided to put together the roundtable discussion.  At least 25 students will join in the filmed conversation tomorrow.

Dartmouth inaugurated the Ivy League's first Asian-American university president on Tuesday: former Harvard Medical School professor Jim Yong Kim.
Addressing a crowd of over 5,000, Kim sought to allay the concerns of some critics that he may be too focused on the practical effects of medicine to appreciate the arts and humanities. But Kim did his share of name-dropping to show that a liberal arts education and leading a useful life often go together.
“Reading ‘The Tempest,’ debating Aristotle’s ethics or choreographing a dance are supremely practical activities," he said. "They provide the experiences of beauty and shared meaning which are central to building a more just world.”
Kim appropriately did not address the more racist criticisms that arose over one of Dartmouth's most widely circulated e-mail updates soon after he was named president in early March, including:
Whoever wrote that comment does not seem to have bothered to do a simple Google search: Kim is Korean, not Chinese.
Kim has had no apparent previous connections to Dartmouth—he did not study there and has not taught there—but his resume is very Ivy League-heavy. He graduated from Brown and earned his MD and Ph.D. from Harvard before teaching at Harvard from 1993 to 2009. Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Allan M. Brandt attended the inauguration ceremony as Harvard's delegate.
More Ivy League news, including the death of a racy 19th-century Stanford tradition because of swine flu, after the jump.
Stanford
Swine flu has claimed its first casualty at Stanford: Full Moon on the Quad, an illustrious tradition dating back to the late 19th century, where seniors make out with freshmen under the first full moon of the year. University administrators have canceled the event for this year, citing that it's a "recipe for disaster." It remains unclear how seniors and freshmen will compensate for the disappointment.
Yale, Cornell, Princeton
Senseless death seems to have become a recurring theme around the Ivy League. Only a couple of days after Yale pharmacology student Annie Le's body was found on the day she was supposed to get married, Sylvia Bingham, a recent Yale graduate who was passionate about social justice, died in a bike accident in Cleveland. As evidenced by the string of quotes that the Yale Daily News threw together, their reporting attention was still focused on Le. Warren Schor, a 20-year-old Cornell junior, also recently died of swine flu.
But most recently, Princeton's Eliot Ramsay Kalmbach ’09-’10, 24, died Tuesday afternoon after falling from a mountain in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. He was going on a cross-country trip with a friend before starting a technology internship this fall. According to his sister, Kalmbach was planning to finish his graduation requirements in the spring. Some online commenters have written that Princeton should give him a diploma post mortem in his honor.

FlyBy readers be warned: the other FlyBy—the allegedly fast alternative to battling the river house dhalls at lunch—seems to have declined in its rapidity. No longer a forgotten option for the perpetually busy upperclassman (or Quad resident), FlyBy's popularity has apparently grown noticeably this year.
FlyBy (blog) entered FlyBy (HUDS) yesterday afternoon during the 12 p.m. rush to discover a slow moving line of students winding around all the way around the pub exterior to the door at the end of the hall. Some students were making practical use of the waiting time, catching up on some forgotten class reading and even meticulously taking notes in the margins while robotically shuffling along towards their destination. Read on about this new inefficiency after the jump.
The consensus among students patiently waiting in line was that a new layout in FlyBy's interior is to blame for the lengthy lines. "It's definitely the fact that they've changed the stuff around," says Fabian A. Poliak '11. According to him FlyBy has replaced its handy milk and juice cartons (a la elementary school) with a proper drinks dispenser. This forces students to take extra time inside to prepare their drinks as well as juggle an extra component to carry. And as usual, mandatory ID swiping causes an unavoidable delay as students dig through their bags and wallets, all the while juggling slippery plastic bags, a cup of juice—oh yeah, and grabbing that last napkin. Joseph C. Higgins '11 agreed that "the biggest thing is the swipe card delay."
Most students FlyBy (Blog) talked to were not pleased about the lengthy lines.
"It doesn't make sense any more—I'm going to have to sit through class hungry," said Mukudzei T. Borerwe '10, who gave up on the line and left without even entering the food service area. He added a handy metaphor to help out any of us who were a bit confused: "I used to feel like the Concorde, but now I would have to be a freaking military jet with tanks and stuff." (Because it's "Fly" By, get it? get it?)
"I demand my right to food quickly and efficiently, and I feel that Harvard is not listening to my needs as a student and a human being," said one anonymous sophomore.
But not everyone thinks the problem is as dire as the anonymous revolutionary quoted above. Nick P. Stanford '12 said he did not mind waiting. "It's nice to just stand still for six minutes."
Despite the lines, some students said they will still turn to FlyBy for weekday lunch. "They shouldn't call it FlyBy," said K. Abby Koff '12, although she added that returning to her house "would probably be the same amount of time." The sophomore added that he was avoiding the Greenhouse cafe since it costs money, and "you never know when you're going to need your BoardPlus." Save those dollars for a special occasion.
