After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though he will graduate from Harvard this week, Law School Student Government President Matthew P. Gelfand will extend his term through the summer in order to rewrite the organization’s constitution.
Gelfand, who won a heated, three-way race in March, triumphed over second-year students with his platform of “Win. Fix. Resign.” and a promise to make the operations of the student government more transparent.
“Other people have hobbies. I have the student government constitution,” Gelfand joked.
Gelfand initially planned to write the new constitution during his first eight weeks in office. However, after receiving nearly 400 responses to a survey about the role student government should play, Gelfand explained in an email to Law School students that he did not want to rush the reform process.
“I was blown away,” Gelfand said. “I mean, some people wrote me what amounted to essays about their feelings on the issues, so I was very heartened by the response.”
In the survey, a strong majority of students agreed that student government meetings should be open to the student body, that its leadership should release any documents related to its operation, and that the new constitution, which will be completed by and voted on in August or September, should be ratified by the students.
Though most students appreciated the variety of organizations and journals on campus, according to survey results, nearly 70 percent supported some reorganization of student groups and event planning.
“There could be better coordination in activities that organizations have, and I think that working to create a system that will help people figure out if they’re planning a similar event for the same day as another organization is a very simple fix that hasn’t been implemented that could be implemented,” Gelfand said.
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said that the school supports diverse student organizations but acknowledged that scheduling conflicts have in the new student spaces in Wasserstein Hall.
“The new building has both the opportunities for more space, but then the opportunities for more scheduling conflicts because more events will occur at the same time, so it’s something that we’re looking at,” Minow said.
Student government representative and SJD student Daniel B. Vargas, who ran against Gelfand for the presidency, wrote in an email that he supported Matt’s agenda to revamp the constitution.
“Writing a good constitution could be an important step to restore the credibility and to affirm the independence of an institution that for a long time would do nothing more than distribute cookies and passively broadcast the instructions of the Administration,” Vargas wrote. “The Student Government elections showed that the HLS student body wants much more than that—it wants to be heard and to be taken seriously.”

CORRECTION: May 22
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Matthew P. Gelfand received more than 90 percent of the votes in the Harvard Law School student government election in March. In fact, though Gelfand won more than 90 percent of the vote in an unofficial poll conducted by the website Above the Law, the vote tally of the election at the Law School was not announced publicly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering Saturday, the Harvard softball team faced two elimination games if it wanted its season to last one more day. Seventeen Rachel Brown strikeouts later, the season was very much alive and well.
Behind two standout performances from the senior ace, the Crimson won both of its contests on Saturday, topping Maryland, 3-2, in extra innings before beating Texas Tech, 2-0, later in the day. The pair of victories set up a rematch with Washington, who dealt Harvard its first tournament loss on Friday.
HARVARD 2, TEXAS TECH 0
The Crimson (35-15, 17-3 Ivy)  didn’t have long to celebrate its season-saving win over Maryland, as it had to quickly turn around and continue fighting for its tournament life against No. 23 Texas Tech (41-17, 13-10 Big 12).
A year prior, the Red Raiders had knocked Harvard out of the tournament with a 7-0 shutout. This time, the Crimson got its revenge.
After throwing 142 pitches in the day’s first matchup, Brown looked just as strong in game two as she pitched her third complete game in two days, finishing the two-day performance with a three-hit shutout.
Afterwards, Harvard coach Jenny Allard said she intended to potentially use three pitchers against Texas Tech to curb its offense and tapped Brown as the starter because she was still loose. But Brown shut down the Red Raider offense, leaving Allard no choice but to continue riding her ace.
“I pitched successfully against Texas Tech last year, but we also knew that we had very capable other pitchers, so if I had a rough inning, I knew I had a short leash,” Brown said.
Meanwhile, the Harvard offense put two runs on the board to put the team in its first Regional Final in program history. Both of those history-making runs came in the bottom of the fourth as the Crimson played small ball. Two singles and a groundout put runners on second and third, and then a bunt and sac fly brought both home to put Harvard up 2-0.
In the bottom of the seventh, Texas Tech led off the inning with a single but then hit into a double play. Sophomore Shelbi Olson corralled a deep fly ball to right field to end the contest. The out elicited a huge fist pump from Brown on the mound before the team gathered to celebrate its historic win.
HARVARD 3, MARYLAND 2 (8 INN.)
In its first game of the day at Husky Softball Stadium in Seattle, Wash., a pair of doubles helped the Crimson earn the Ivy League’s first win in an NCAA tournament game in seven years. Harvard gained and then lost a two-run lead in the fifth inning against No. 50 Maryland (34-22, 10-8 ACC) but then scored the winning run in the eighth inning to earn another game with a 3-2 victory.
The win was Harvard’s first in the tournament in 14 years and ended Maryland’s season.
Through four innings, the pitchers were having their way. Brown had given up one hit while Terrapin hurler Kendra Knight held Harvard hitless.
To start the fifth, freshman Katherine Lantz broke up the no-hit bid with a lead-off single. A sacrifice bunt moved Lantz to second, who then came home on a double by senior Whitney Shaw. Freshman Andrea Del Conte came in to pinch run for Shaw and consequently moved to third and scored on a pair of singles.
The Crimson’s 2-0 lead didn’t last long though, as Maryland came right back in the bottom of the fifth. After a double left runners on second and third, another double scored both, knotting the game at 2-2. Brown then ended the inning with one of her 12 strikeouts.
In the bottom of the seventh, the Terrapins looked poised to break the tie as two walks put Brown in a jam. The senior ace was able to avoid season-ending damage though, getting out of the inning on two fielder’s choice outs to take the game into extra innings.
In the top of the eighth, Harvard did what Maryland could not, netting what would be the game-winning run.
One out in, junior Ashley Heritage showed off her wheels by getting on with an infield hit and then stealing second.
The hard work paid off when sophomore Kasey Lange drove Heritage in with a double to left. That put the onus on Brown to come out for an eighth inning and get the Crimson a long sought-after tournament win. She did just that.
Despite giving up a single and allowing that runner to move to second on a passed ball, Brown struck out three Terrapin batters to seal the 3-2 win.
“From the get go, we knew we could beat them,” Allard said. “We knew we could be competitive. I think we just really worked on staying zoned in. We pushed two runs across, and we were confident that we just needed to stay the course.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team’s wild three-day NCAA tournament run came to an end Sunday at the hands of 16th-seeded Washington. The No. 18 Huskies (39-17, 7-15 Pac-12) shut out the Crimson, 4-0, giving the Ivy champ its second loss in the double elimination tournament.
The Crimson offense provided enough run support to get the Harvard (35-15, 17-3 Ivy) past two elimination games Saturday but then returned to dormancy Sunday. Two days after being blanked by Washington’s Kaitlin Inglesby, the Crimson bats were kept silent by the Huskies’ Bryanna Walker Sunday. Walker held Harvard to four hits in a complete game effort. The Crimson got runners in scoring position with doubles in the third and sixth innings, but both times came up empty.
“They threw a totally different pitcher we hadn’t seen, and she was really effective,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We had isolated quality at-bats, but we couldn’t string hits together.”
Despite the lack of offensive support, co-captain Rachel Brown continued to battle for the third straight day, registering her fourth complete game over that time span. Though she completed the feat of durability and stamina, Brown wasn’t as successful Sunday.
“She was definitely really fatigued, so you didn’t see a lot of strikeouts,” Allard said. “But because her off-speed stuff is so effective and Washington was such a strong lineup, we needed her changeup in the mix today.”
In the top of the first inning, Brown surrendered her first run in 10 innings on a single by Inglesby. The base hit drove in leadoff hitter Victoria Hayward, who had stolen second after getting on due to a fielding error by senior Jane Alexander.
Eventually, Brown got out of the inning, but more damage would come just around the corner.
A single and a walk came back to bite Brown in the fourth frame when Nikia Williams homered to stretch the Washington lead to 4-0.
“As riseball pitchers get tired, more home runs are likely to happen,” Brown said. “It was a good pitch. The hitter who hit it is on the national team. She’s a very good hitter.”
Following the home run, Brown was her dominant self, holding the Huskies scoreless for the final three innings.
“She was a champion for us,” Allard said. She was a leader in the circle; she kept the opponents at bay. This year she was just so much stronger.”
Still, it was not enough, as Harvard’s season came to an end after Alexander went down swinging, leaving co-captain Whitney Shaw stranded on first.
Even with the disappointing finish, the Crimson’s performance in the 2012 NCAA Tournament set a new standard for Ivy softball teams of the 21st century. It had been seven years since an Ancient Eight team won a tournament game, but Harvard—ranked 100th coming into the tournament—managed to get two victories over No. 23 Texas Tech and No. 50 Maryland.
“It’s historic,” Allard said. “I’ve coached here 18 years, and we’ve never made it to the Regional Final. We entered the tournament as a 4 seed [in the region] and ended in the final. It shows how hard the players worked and how confident they were against really top-caliber teams.”
With their victory over the Crimson, the Huskies advance to the Super Regional for a best-of-three series with a spot in the eight-team Women’s College World Series on the line. Harvard, on the other hand, will return to Cambridge looking to regroup and prepare to fight for a third straight Ivy League title in 2013.
“I think the experience of winning a championship and going to regionals and having that experience moving forward is great for our underclassmen to know what it means to compete at that level,” Allard said.
Next year, the team will have to compete without the service of Brown, a two-time Ivy League Pitcher of the Year, and Alexander, who broke out this year and was rewarded with a co-Ivy Player of the Year honor.
“We’ve been incredibly lucky to be a part of Harvard softball,” Brown said. “Hopefully we left it better than we found it.”
