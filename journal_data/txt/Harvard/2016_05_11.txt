After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A key sanction the University has adopted in its opposition to unrecognized single-sex social organizations like final clubs is to deny their members endorsements for Rhodes Scholarships and other fellowships requiring the University's imprimatur. I administer the Rhodes Scholarships in the United States, although I write this strictly in my personal capacity.
This is not the first time university endorsements for the Rhodes Scholarships have been linked to issues of gender discrimination.
In his late 19th century will, Cecil J. Rhodes restricted the scholarships he would endow to "male students." By the 1970s, and just as Oxford University and its constituent colleges started to act with urgency to create substantially greater admissions opportunities for women, the Rhodes Trustees, leading American universities, and many Rhodes Scholars felt it critical to open the scholarships to women. Harvard, for example, provocatively endorsed three women in 1973, knowing of course they were ineligible. But the change to allow women, widely desired on both sides of the Atlantic, was not easy to effect. British law allowed the Rhodes Trustees no discretion to alter the terms of a will.
While British legal processes were underway, the Rhodes Trust was concerned that actions such as Harvard's and a few other universities, two lawsuits, the implications of recently-enacted Title IX, and threats by the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department would make it impossible for the American Rhodes Scholarships to continue. In 1974, while the British legal changes were pending, the American Secretary of the Rhodes Trust ended the institutional endorsement requirement, leaving students able to apply without the formal support of their colleges, and leaving American institutions arguably more insulated from possible Title IX sanctions. Fortunately, the British government, through Parliamentary action, soon removed the discriminatory terms set in the Rhodes will, and 13 women, including three from Radcliffe, were elected in 1976 to enter Oxford in 1977. The university endorsement requirement was later reestablished.
With Harvard's newly-announced policy, this Rhodes Trust endorsement requirement may again play a role relating to gender exclusivity. Given the considerable number of Harvard sophomores who aspire to scholarships like the Rhodes or the Marshall, the effect of disallowing the applications of those who join organizations that the University has determined to be inimical to its core values of inclusiveness and nondiscrimination is likely to be great—perhaps far more so than the sanctions to be attached to college leadership positions.
I was a Harvard Rhodes Scholar in 1974, the pivotal year of the behind-the-scenes changes that would open the world's oldest and probably most famous scholarship to women two years later. I remember being impressed by the moral strength of a few classmates who—while they had the records of academic excellence, character, service, and leadership our selectors look for, and wanted to study at Oxford—did not apply because of the exclusion of women, an ethical standard the vast majority of us did not live up to. The Rhodes Scholarships could not have retained their stature if the discrimination continued much longer.
In 1973, the peak of the behind-the-scenes legal challenges to the then single-sex Rhodes Scholarships, I was also the president of the formerly all-male Spee Club. And I am thrilled that it voted to admit women last year, before the new Harvard policy with its attendant sanctions was announced (albeit then fully aware of the University's strong opposition to gender-restrictive clubs, and the Dean's moral jawboning backed by serious threats to do something about them).
The Spee Club has long prided itself for being perhaps the most progressive final club, consistently the first to champion a more diverse membership—and diverse in virtually all dimensions before this last and critical one. Indeed, fellow graduate members of the club had long advocated women membership; it was the undergraduates who until recently largely opposed it. They are now, by my own observation, delighted.
Whether most graduates came to our inclusive views simply because of the natural sentiments of fathers with daughters, because we came to realize that the club conveyed lifelong benefits and privileges (albeit modest ones) that should not morally be restricted by gender, because we came to realize, like Harvard itself, that diversity made us stronger, and frankly far more fun and interesting, or because we simply recognized that the alleged separation of the clubs from Harvard was a self-serving and obvious fiction, and that their campus presence is in-your-face and significant for all students—most of us have been strongly supportive of the change. I have little doubt that Spee members John F. and Robert F. Kennedy would be proud of their old club too—and I suspect they each might also have rallied to the courageous stance of Harvard's president, Drew Faust.
Some day, most Harvard final club alumni will look back and wonder how we could accept gender discriminatory membership for so long. Our colleagues at Yale and Princeton, in somewhat similar institutions, made these transitions some time ago and undergraduate life for members and nonmembers alike has only improved.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After writing an essay this past fall about my decision to leave the Spee Club, I couldn’t help but be reminded of the Joan Didion quote in which she decried, after publication of her fabled “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” that she had “never gotten feedback so universally beside the point.” Down the aisle, from those who liked and disliked my article, the finger-pointing was always shifted outwards. For my friends in female clubs, the piece was about the Spee’s false self-righteousness for going co-ed. To my friends in male clubs, it was about the Spee’s special place within final club hell. And for those outside the Mt. Auburn scene, it was a confirmation of their wildest fears about the big bad clubs. No matter the position within Harvard’s stratified social world, the story was always, always about someone else. 
The other day President Faust announced sanctions against students who choose to join unrecognized single-sex social organization, and the criticism has been swift and vocal. The Crimson has called for sanctions solely against male final clubs, journalists all-over the country are currently rolling up their sleeves to write searing op-eds on freedom of association, and, most pointedly, female members of sororities and final clubs have taken to Facebook to reiterate the positive and empowering impact of these organizations. The sanctions, the line of thought goes, unfairly punishes women who aren’t perpetuating power imbalances on campus, and inadvertently penalizes organizations that give Harvard females a much needed respite from the all-seeing male gaze. A sanction that is supposed to tackle issues of gender inequality will actually dismantle organizations that provide respite and empowerment to the disenfranchised.
And while I hate the male gaze as much as one who has never felt its true strength can, I can’t help but feel that this logic, in many ways, tip-toes around greater issues of exclusivity and access on this campus in which we are all complicit. For example, when an acquaintance of mine in a female final club posts a photo with the caption “ain’t nobody fucking with my clique” and it receives some hundreds of likes, I see and empathize with a group of women who have found an all-female network on a campus that is rife with gender inequity and are incensed at the thought of it being ripped away. I see this photo and understand that as a man, I will never truly know what it feels like to have a space in which my gender does not limit me. Yet in this photo, I also see a group of women who are, on average, more privileged, well-connected and comfortable within Harvard’s bastions of elitism than the vast majority of this school. In this photo, I see the hundreds of other female Harvard students who were denied entry into this “clique” because they weren’t deemed socially abled, “cool” or interesting enough; who would, even if admitted, struggle to fit in within the rarefied world this clique assumes as the norm.
We can be marginalized in some ways and privileged in others. We can be discriminated by certain in-groups while still perpetuating discrimination against other out-groups. This is called intersectionality, and none of us are exempt from it.
These sanctions are, at their core, an attempt to address questions of access to capital on our campus: who gets it and why, and how the the allocation of this access affects the student body as a whole. Unequivocally, these sanctions, and the administration, have failed. They have failed to understand that co-educational spaces are not inherently equal spaces, nor will be, as long as gender inequity exists. They have failed to propose recognized alternatives to the vacuum this sanction creates for the very group it purports to defend. They have failed to recognize that the plurality of the single-sex organizations they have targeted, namely female sororities, work hard to confront and counteract issues of access. They have failed to confront honestly the multitude of factors at play on a campus in which sexual assault is the norm. They have failed to take true responsibility for creating social alternatives at a school without an off-campus scene and for a student body in which the majority cannot legally drink. Harvard students should protest these sanctions. They should fight them. But, as long as the sanctions are in place, Harvard students should also begin to look towards the future. What would a Harvard without single-sex organizations look like?
I propose that it is possible to envision a Harvard without single-sex social organizations that is just as, if not more, accessible, equitable and socially vibrant than the Harvard we have today. I propose that it is possible for the disenfranchised and marginalized to build community and find empowerment without creating exclusionary social groups. But mainly, I propose it is possible to imagine a Harvard in which exclusivity is not incorporated, upheld and perpetuated by the student body in all facets of life. Because while exclusive single-sex social organizations can be about empowerment and support, they are also inextricable from Harvard students’ constant need to see the world in terms of institutional hierarchies. Clearly defined, tangible and structured indicators of success.
We freely, vigorously and, in my opinion, detrimentally apply these institutional pressures to the scholarly, extracurricular and vocational. Why make friendship—the one realm of life that, outside Harvard, is rarely institutionalized—mitigated by status? Why turn a facet of our human experience that is supposed to be joyous, immediate and fluid into a prescribed and competitive process? How do we make Harvard a place that is, for lack of a better word, fun? Free-wheeling, open, respectful, spontaneous and fair.
Without a doubt, these sanctions unduly affect the ones on campus for whom fairness is most necessitated. But the administration’s failure does not negate the very real failure on the part of many Harvard students to have imagined, even wanted, anything beyond the status quo—to imagine what a future Harvard without exclusive social organizations could look like. Because if we can begin to imagine it in one area, what stops of us from envisioning it in the other areas of our life that so desperately demand reimagining? Our extracurriculars and our classes; our future professions and careers; even the very way we interact, view and engage with one another as peers.
It is this lack of imagination in our everyday, especially from those within certain axes of power, that holds Harvard from being the equitable and accessible place so many of us want it to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As this year’s strange and unpredictable presidential campaign winds its way to the summer conventions, the importance of voting has never been clearer. Around the country, however, this most fundamental of rights is under siege. The Supreme Court’s 2013 decision to gut the Voting Rights Act has allowed states like Texas and North Carolina to pass restrictive voting measures that disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color. For a country that has struggled to encourage adequate levels voter turnout and seen historical injustices weigh heavily on certain communities, these new laws are particularly counterproductive.
Fortunately, several states have been moving in the opposite direction. Oregon, for example, set a strong example for the rest of the country last year when it passed an automatic voter registration law. Under the Oregon model, anyone who applies for a driver's license or another form of state ID is automatically registered to vote, unless they choose to opt out. California gave the go-ahead to a similar system this past October. Thanks to the efforts of the New Democracy Coalition and state Representative Evandro C. Carvalho, Massachusetts state legislators have a chance to join their Oregonian and Californian counterparts in making voting easier. It is an opportunity they should take.
As the New Democracy Coalition’s founder, Kevin C. Peterson, told the Boston Globe, the adoption of such a measure would be a key statement in an era of voter suppression. Massachusetts should be a leader on this issue, and Representative Carvalho’s bill would expand on other states’ designs by creating a database of eligible voters from multiple sources, including public universities—an acknowledgement of the significant role that young people should play in the democratic process. Peterson has also argued convincingly that automatic voter registration will reduce the costs associated with paper registration forms and decrease fraud because of the existence of a centralized database.
This last point is especially crucial, as opponents of automatic registration have often cited fraud as a concern. Just as in the debate over voter ID laws, the fraud argument is a red herring. In reality, automatic voter registration has the potential to eliminate the small amount of fraud that does exist while also expanding access and lowering the initial psychological barrier to voter participation.
One of the sad side-effects of the turn towards voter suppression is that truly creative attempts to expand voting have faltered. Massachusetts could help reverse this trend by creating an automatic registration system, but government at all levels should think bigger. One of the greatest injustices of American elections is that most voting takes place on a Tuesday, which can force voters to choose between work and having a say in government. Making election day a national holiday—something supported by Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton—would ensure that all Americans can exercise their rights without economic consequences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before this semester, I had never written an opinion piece. Hell, before this semester I had never taken the time to write—I actively distanced myself from it. If you had told me I would end up writing for The Crimson when I was a senior in high school, I would have called you crazy. But, here I am, and I am not just writing for the Crimson, but as of last week, I am also an editor at the esteemed institution.
I really had no idea what to expect when I began this process. I had just finished my football career, limping away with what was left of my health, needing a new crutch to hold myself up. When a friend of mine sent out an email about writing a column for The Crimson, I was intrigued. I was stuck on the self-deluding belief that college is where “you find yourself!” I applied, and by the grace of some higher power, I was accepted as a columnist. I came in believing I’d be able to write about anything, but after a semester, my wide eyes have narrowed.
As always, I sat down to write something thought provoking for this last column. Originally, I wanted to write about final clubs, because they’re always a good jumping off point for a general discussion. But most opinions on the subject have been published at this point.
Then, I thought I should talk about the reverberations from the sanctions. There has been minimal discussion about it, and I think I have something unique to say on the subject.
When I saw the outpouring of responses to the sanctions—predominately from sororities and female final clubs, complaining about how unfair they were—I was incredibly confused. Personally, I believe that these sanctions would have an effect antithetical to improving the social scene on campus, instead making club non-club distinction all the more divisive. If you want my solution, read here. But while I think there are many plausible arguments for sanctioning only men’s clubs, the rationale these women are using to justify why they should not receive sanctions doesn’t make sense to me.
The columnist in me is itching to comment on all of this. But while I feel myself slipping into a rant on the absurdity of the situation, the cynical part of me is saying that I shouldn’t devote a column to it. If I were to talk about how #HearHerHarvard is without direction and relies on a faulty argument, regardless of how blandly I spoke on the subject, I’d be unfairly labeled a misogynist, and that’s a repercussion I wish to avoid.
This is the most important lesson I’ve learned about myself as a writer: I don’t like to push the hot button.
It’s hard for me to say what I really feel when that falls outside the social confines of acceptability. And I think most other people too, just like me, hesitate to engage with the truth, because the truth is too dangerous. So as I scroll through my newsfeed on Facebook, I see smarter kids than myself selling out for the New York Times and posts attempting to rationalize irrationality. Hell, the only outrageous posts I see are people selling their souls for click bait. The only room for genuinely valuable opinion pieces comes in topics that people aren’t scared of, like politics or friendship.
While I’ve become a part of a community of refined thinkers who want to push dialogue towards growth and strive for truth, I think we often only strive for truth if it doesn’t compromise our own interests.  Over and over, I see people mold their views to fit the social modicum of acceptability. Because Harvard kids have so much to lose, they don’t put themselves in situations to lose it. Writing is all well and good, and it’s important to sound smart in dialogue as it reflects well on your intellect, but if it hurts your pre-career options it must be curtailed and curated. Many people here feel a certain obligation to the people who supported them in the process to tangibly succeed. For many, that means landing a good job upon graduation, and the security associated with it.
But hell, who am I to judge, I wimped out of an article that accurately discussed the argumentative lapse by the #HearHerHarvard agenda so far. But I don’t want to just let the rogue SatireV do the real opinion pieces behind the impunity of satire.
So while I agree with the #HearHerHarvard cause, I cannot support their reasoning. The #HearHerHarvard posts all seem to say something along the lines of “This place has made me feel that Harvard is a home, given me a community, and made me feel accepted.” Well ma’am, the basis of your acceptance is a process built on exclusion, so your argument is nonsensical in light of the fact that the intention of the sanctions is to remove exclusivity. The chanting at the rally that was held the other day was about sexual assault being wrong, but everyone agrees with that, and it was not the basis for these sanctions anyway.
When I started this article I wanted to avoid talking about the #HearHerHarvard cause, because I feared the repercussions. As I read over my writing, I see that it ended up being the main feature of this piece. I guess I was wrong in my lesson. I don’t shy away from the hot button. And maybe college is where you “find yourself” after all. Hell, I have two years and hopefully plenty more after that to see whether that’s true.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an inaugural year that featured impressive enrollment numbers and an unprecedented undergraduate teaching program, the staff of CS50, Harvard’s flagship introductory computer science course, is gearing up for its second year at Yale.
CS50, which has consistently been one of Harvard’s largest courses since David J. Malan began teaching it in 2007, made its debut on the New Haven campus in the fall of 2015. With an enrollment of 510 students, it was the most popular course at Yale that semester. Malan made occasional appearances at Yale, but most lectures were broadcasted from Sanders Theater at Harvard.
“It sounded a little weird, but I was open to it,” said Antonio Medina, a Yale freshman who took the course. “I thought it would be weird to not have a live professor, but they gave so many resources that it didn’t matter.”
Like their counterparts in Cambridge, Yale students could attend office hours with the CS50 teaching staff for help with weekly problem sets. Although CS50 has a reputation for its rigor and difficulty at Harvard, instructors and students alike said the workload was unexpectedly challenging for many at Yale.
“The biggest challenge was communicating what the course is all about—that we try to facilitate a community, that it's time consuming, that it's rigorous, and that it can be extremely rewarding,” Jason C. Hirschhorn ’14-’15, a former Harvard teaching fellow who now heads the course at Yale, wrote in an e-mail to the Crimson.
Yale computer science professor Brian Scassellati led CS50’s teaching staff, which included graduate students and, for the first time on Yale’s campus, undergraduate course assistants. The undergraduate learning assistants, or ULAs, were trained during the spring before CS50’s fall kick-off. Although unique, the undergraduate teaching program received positive feedback from students.
“It made it a lot more comfortable to go ask for help, they were very accessible,” Medina said. “I had a senior as my TA, so he was older but I still felt like he was a classmate that I could talk to.”
CS50’s student teaching staff has expanded by about 10 percent in preparation for next fall, according to the Yale Daily News. While the 55 new student hires undergo spring training, another staff member is preparing for his new role: Patrick Rebeschini, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale, will be replacing Scassellati as the course instructor.
Rebeschini wrote in an e-mail to the Crimson that he does not “foresee any major changes” to CS50’s curriculum next year, although the teaching staff hopes to improve scheduling and communication with students.
“Some students were surprised by the course's workload. But now that there is some institutional memory, students should be able to plan schedules all the more effectively,” Rebeschini wrote. “We are considering adding letter grades projections, on top of the weekly scores that students already receive, so that students can better monitor their progress and their expected final grade.”
Additionally, Rebeschini said the staff hopes to expand support for students next fall, especially those who are less comfortable with the material, by improving the course’s office hours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a nationwide push from for more graduate  students benefits, Columbia University administrators announced Tuesday new policies of paid parental leave, childcare subsidies, and reduced fees for Ph.D. students.
The broad changes were introduced to standardize benefits for Ph.D. students across Columbia’s graduate schools. Beginning next fall, current parental leave and childcare benefits will be extended to all Ph.D. students in any graduate program, according to Columbia’s Graduate Student Advisory Council.
In January, Harvard also unveiled new benefits for its Ph.D. students, announcing it will now provide students with a 50 percent discount for MBTA passes. A month later, GSAS said it would double the leave time and stipend for adoptive and expectant parents, from six to 12 weeks and from $3,100 to $6,264, respectively.
The Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers, a graduate student unionization effort, had pushed for such benefits for more than two years. Their movement is similar to a graduate student union effort at Harvard, which has amped up its activities since going public last spring. On its Facebook page, the Columbia group posted an all caps “VICTORY.”
Columbia’s new benefits include 12 weeks of paid parental leave and a $2,000 subsidy for each child under five.
At Harvard, union organizers garnered majority support for their effort among graduate students employed by Harvard in February. The University opposes the union effort, arguing that a union would change the relationship between the school and it students from one based in academics to one based in labor. In March, Harvard filed a joint amicus brief to the National Labor Relations Board with its peer institutions against graduate student unionization. The NLRB will soon decide if private institutions must recognize democratically elected graduate student unions.
When Harvard’s GSAS announced its new benefits, Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana said the improvements were prompted by a reassessment of the current benefits and by engaging more with graduate students.
Harvard has experienced similar issues regarding the standardization of student benefits. GSAS administers all Ph.D.s across the University, so all doctoral candidates receive guaranteed tuition, healthcare coverage, and a stipend. Beginning next fall, the five Doctor of Science programs at the School of Public Health will be brought under a unified Ph.D. program, and those students will receive the same benefits as doctoral candidates in GSAS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 11, 2016, at 11:35 p.m.
As the backlash against a new Harvard policy continues, unrecognized single-gender social organizations are weighing their legal options, although experts disagree about the viability of any potential litigation.
While no one fraternity, sorority, or final club has yet publicly announced plans to pursue legal action against the policy starting with the Class of 2021—which will bar their members from holding leadership positions and team captaincies and receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships—few are explicitly abandoning the option.
When Harvard administrators announced the change Friday, the graduate president of the Fly Club, Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 and Jonathan M. Pierce, a national spokesperson for the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, did not rule out legal action. Pierce said Alpha Epsilon Pi would “be forwarding this to our legal counsel and be reaching out to our partners at other Greek organizations and other clubs.” Porteus, meanwhile, said the Fly would not “rule out anything that was within the law and morally and ethically defensible.”
Representatives of the two national umbrella organizations for fraternities and sororities—the North American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Conference—emphasized their desire for a negotiated agreement with the University before turning to litigation. Both organizations contributed to  a joint statement against the sanctions released Monday.
“Our current focus is on advocacy to implore Harvard to reconsider this policy, and further, to recognize fraternities and sororities,” Heather Kirk, national spokesperson for the North American Interfraternity Conference, wrote in an email. “There is greater opportunity to improve the university community and campus safety if we work collaboratively.”
In an emailed statement, National Panhellenic Conference Executive Director Dani Weatherford called discussion of legal action “premature.”
“Our priority right now is doing the advocacy work to highlight the value of the spaces, support networks and opportunities inherent to the sorority experience,” Weatherford wrote. “Ultimately, we urge our Harvard colleagues to listen to the women on their campus and re-think this policy.”
In an emailed statement, College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote that the policy would not prevent students “from choosing their own paths while at Harvard.”
“We are not seeking to regulate the internal affairs of the unrecognized social organizations; they retain the authority to set their membership criteria, even as the College will continue to urge them to adopt inclusive and non-discriminatory policies,” Dane wrote. “Likewise, students will be able to continue to join these organizations and remain in good academic standing with the College. The recommendations are instead focused exclusively on decisions belonging to the College.”
While few organizations are ruling out litigation entirely, legal experts disagree on the feasibility of a possible suit.
Harvey A. Silverglate, a historically vocal opponent of Harvard administrators and the most optimistic of the four legal experts interviewed, said a potential suit against the University would have “a slightly better than 50-50 chance of winning,” adding that a more definitive guess would be impossible given that such a suit would be “pretty much unprecedented.”
Greg F. Hauser, an attorney who has worked extensively with Greek organizations, said he thought Harvard’s policy left the University on firm legal footing.
“I don’t like coming to that conclusion, but the way existing law is concerning private colleges and universities, I don’t think I see any very serious grounds for a challenge,” Hauser said. “That’s not to say you couldn’t come up with some creative arguments.”
One such argument might consist of filing a suit in the Massachusetts court as opposed to in the federal system. Peter F. Lake ’81, a higher education law expert at Stetson University College of Law and Silverglate both pointed to Massachusetts’ unique state laws, which place more emphasis on freedom of association than federal statutes, as a possible wildcard in potential legal proceedings.
“Under the Massachusetts constitution... there is a minimal level of fair dealing that a private association owes to its members,” Silverglate said. “That doctrine has been held to apply to the obligations of private universities to its students.”
Silverglate is a co-founder of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which recently posted a petition requesting that University Drew G. Faust to “restore freedom of association at Harvard.”
Lake shared Silverglate’s view for the most part, saying that he didn’t think “the Massachusetts Supreme judicial court would be completely oblivious to the rights of individuals to associate in large private associations like Harvard.”
Still, Lake and other lawyers agreed that Harvard’s status as a private institution grants it more leeway than a public university would have in a similar situation.
“Because Harvard is private, its predominate relationship with students is contractual,” Lake said. “It does give a private institution the right to set certain standards for students that might not be acceptable at a public institutions. But that’s just part of the story.”
Lake said that if any new policies violated “promises that have been made to students based on student handbooks” or other official documents, a suit could be strengthened.
Timothy M. Burke, a lawyer with a history of representing Greek organizations, said Harvard’s decision to begin enforcement of the policy for members of the Class of 2021, who have yet to apply to Harvard, could serve to sidestep any arguments of “contractual breach.”
“Harvard has its very bright attorneys that have been looking at this,” Burke said, though he added that the delayed enforcement also gives affected single-gender organizations more time “to analyze the problems that are going to be created.”
James M. Myers ’77, who said he was a member of the Porcellian Club, also questioned the viability of taking on Harvard in court.
“Last time I checked, you don’t sue someone who has a law school on retainer,” Myers said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
National media outlets have spent months puzzling over the strong support on college campuses for Democratic presidential nominee and 74-year-old socialist Bernie Sanders, but at Harvard some students say that dynamic has gone misunderstood.
Harvard has its fair share of supporters for the Vermont senator, but undergraduate Democrats are fairly split between Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, and supporters on both sides say the debate on campus has been collegial, in contrast to recent media portrayals.
This Sunday, the Guardian published an article entitled, “'I've been silent': Harvard's Clinton backers face life on a pro-Bernie campus.” The story characterized Harvard’s notoriously liberal student body as overwhelmingly in favor of the Sanders, and suppressing of pro-Clinton voices. Included in the article are quotes from three undergraduate Clinton supporters, two of whom reported feeling challenged by Sanders supporters. It followed a letter to the editor published in the New York Times by Sam H. Koppelman ’18, a Clinton supporter and Crimson Magazine and Editorial editor, in which Koppelman wrote, “I’m a Hillary supporter. In their eyes, I might as well be a College Republican.”
However, undergraduate Democrats said both characterizations misstated the political climate on campus.
Harvard College Democrats President and Hillary Clinton supporter Susan X. Wang ’17 said she was “surprised” to see Harvard’s Clinton supporters categorized as silenced by Sanders supporters. She said she has not felt the Clinton-Sanders tension the article conveys, although she noted others may have had different experiences.
“I personally do support Clinton and have never experienced the things that this article talks about,” Wang said, referring to the story in the Guardian. “Most of the people that I’ve talked to say that they can engage in pretty good conversations with people who do not support their primary candidate at this time. It’s not a big deal and is pretty respectful.”
Wang is not alone in her surprise about the article—even the sources quoted in the story said they reject the notion that Harvard’s Clinton supporters are victims in any way.  Koppelman, who was quoted in the Guardian story after his New York Times letter to the editor, said he “rejects the narrative of victimization” presented in the Guardian article.
“As a white, straight, cis-gendered male, I am in no way shape or form a victim. The idea that Hillary supporters are in any way subjugated, persecuted or victimized is absolutely absurd,” Koppelman said. “The point of me talking about this issue was to try and bring about unity and it was not in any way coming from a place of victimization or vulnerability.”
Janet Ho ’19, another source quoted in the Guardian story, said she also rejects the notion that Clinton supporters on campus are silenced.
“Harvard remains an environment in which everyone is free to debate ideas in a climate of civility and mutual respect,” Ho wrote in an email. “I strongly disagree with the notion that Hillary supporters feel the need to remain ‘silent’ about their views.”
Sanders proponents also sought to quell the notion that there was an acrimonious divide between Clinton and Sanders supporters on campus. Justin G. Curtis ‘19, vice president of Harvard Students for Bernie, said there was “no animosity whatsoever” between Harvard’s student organizations for Clinton and Sanders.
Curtis also said he was confident that given the Republican’s expected nomination of Donald Trump, Harvard’s liberals will unite in November to support the Democratic nominee, no matter which candidate prevails. Curtis further noted that the past two presidents of the Harvard College Democrats are Clinton supporters themselves, calling into question whether there is truly a lack of public Clinton support.
Along with surprise and skepticism, the Guardian article faced criticism on social media, and a Harvard Political Review article rebutting the narrative. Kim F. Soffen ’16, an author of the HPR article, said local voter records from the Massachusetts Democratic Primary indicated Clinton had strong local backing, given she won all the precincts where Harvard students commonly vote.
“As people who are pretty tapped into the political scene at Harvard, this is not what we have observed at all,” Soffen said referring to herself and co-writer Colin J.F. Diersing '16, a former president of the Institute of Politics. “We talked to our friends and none of them have observed it either, and we were thinking, maybe this isn’t real at all.”
The writer of the Guardian article, Adam Gabbatt, declined to comment for this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s newly formed Black Hole Initiative received funding two weeks after world-renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking spoke about the initiative to a packed Sanders Theatre on April 19.
The John Templeton Foundation gave $7.2 million of funding over the next three years to the Initiative. Astronomy department chair and Director of the Black Hole Initiative Abraham “Avi” Loeb hailed this project as an “interdisciplinary” fusion of the humanities and sciences.
“The thing that makes it most attractive [for students in the sciences] is the opportunity to speak for people from humanities,” he said.
At the April 19 event Loeb spoke about the goals of the Black Hole Initiative.
“The goal is to bring these people together that otherwise do not meet very often and to cultivate a sort of culture of people interested in black holes,” Loeb said. “It’s the only center worldwide that is focused on research on black holes and because of that, Stephen Hawking made it a special priority to come here.”
Loeb said that the the Initiative received a space at 20 Garden Street, the current location of the Center for Math and Application. He said they hoped to occupy the building by the end of the summer.
History of Science professor Peter L. Galison echoed Loeb’s statement about the importance of the initiative.
“What is singular this effort is it combines history and philosophy of science with these other areas.” Galison said. "Black holes have singular feature, they have attracted the attention of people in many different disciplines.”
Galison also spoke about the "deep philosophical and cultural questions”  that black holes raise.
“What if an object does something that prevents its own existence later on?” he said. “My role will be to convene philosophers from all over the world.”
Galison said he will also be “making a film about the Black Hole Initiative,” exploring the deeper philosophical questions raised by the existence.
Loeb called the grant the “largest grant awarded to the physical sciences” from the John Templeton Foundation. On its website, the Foundation describes itself as a “philanthropic catalyst for discoveries relating to the Big Questions of human purpose and ultimate reality.”
Loeb said he hoped the initiative will be “an attraction for students” who look forward to studying the “fascinating” subject.

Last week, when Harvard unveiled historic new sanctions for members of final clubs and Greek organizations, it set out to change how Harvard College undergraduates would socialize in the years to come.
Starting with the Class of 2021, students who are members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations—like final clubs,  fraternities, and sororities—will be barred from leading student groups, serving as captains of  athletic teams, and receiving College endorsements for many post-graduate fellowships.
With the new rules, the organizations that have collectively counted generations of Harvard students are under the most intense administrative pressure they have experienced since the 1980s, when male final clubs officially disaffiliated with the University. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, a main driver of the push against the clubs—known for heavy alumni involvement—said he thinks they have remained stuck in the past ever since.
“Even in recent decades, as our community has undergone a dramatic and positive transformation, unrecognized single-gender social organizations have lagged behind in ways that are untenable in the 21st century,” Khurana wrote in a letter last Friday explaining the new changes.
But even as Khurana laid out a vision for an evolving undergraduate social experience, Harvard students from different eras were more mixed on what, if any, changes the College should make to the school’s social life.
Though many elected graduate leaders of clubs have publicly and strongly challenged Harvard’s approach to the clubs for months, last week’s announcement has precipitated broader alumni engagement with the the future of these organizations on campus. While the new sanctions apply to single-gender social organizations broadly, the most vocal critics among alumni over the past weeks have been worried about the future of historically all-male final clubs.
Quickly, a flurry of letters appeared in news publications, including The Crimson and the Wall Street Journal, as some alumni denounced the new policies. Some of those opposed even suggested they would stop donating to their alma mater out of principle. Others, however, lauded the University’s decision to make a change that they felt was long overdue.
“I’ve got mixed feelings and I think probably most people do,” Paul J. Zofnass ’69, who was not a member of a final club, said. “I think part of it is what age group you’re a part of.”
‘WE’RE OLD DINOSAURS’
For alumni who fondly remember their undergraduate evenings in clubhouse parlors and may still occasionally sport their club tie, the proposed sanctions—perhaps unsurprisingly—are less than welcome.
When Gerard J. Cassedy ’61 thinks back on his undergraduate days as a member of the Delphic Club, he remembers the gin and tonic-fueled garden parties, the late-night card games, and the women who, at the end of the night, he and the other club members would “put on the T and send back to Wellesley.”
With Harvard’s new policy, though, Cassedy fears that the final clubs—long a controversial cornerstone of social life at Harvard—may soon be defunct. But for Cassedy and other critics of Harvard’s proposed sanctions, Harvard’s exact problem with the clubs and single-gender organizations remains unclear.
Scrutiny around the organizations intensified this year with the release of a task force report linking final clubs to elevated rates of sexual assault. Faust and Khurana’s messages detailing the new policy, however, centered on the exclusion and discrimination inherent in the membership selection processes of unrecognized single-gender groups.
“So is the reason that they’re so upset that there’s actually sexual activity that they’re not happy with, or is it because they just don’t like the clubs and they think the people in them are elitist? I don’t know,” Cassedy said. “We’ve existed for over 100 years, and I can’t see that any harm has come of that.”
James M. Myers ’77, a graduate member of the Porcellian Club, took much the same stance.
“I can see how people think that these elitist clubs are outdated, and they are dinosaurs from the 19th century,” Myers said. “But there’s nothing wrong with that. There’s nothing wrong with these old traditions that are absolutely harmless.”
Irin Carmon ’05 disagreed, contending that the clubs are both anachronistic and actively harmful to campus culture.
“When I was an undergraduate, the clubs seemed like an immutable fact, and the administration appeared to throw up its hands,” she wrote in an email. “I’m so glad that turned out not to be true, since they were a noxious source of class and gender inequality.”
Khurana echoed Carmon in his public proposal to regulate the groups, a four-page document casting the clubs as “discriminatory” and “rife with power imbalances.”
“Even at 20, [the clubs] struck me as hearkening back to a time when women couldn’t own property,” Carmon wrote. “The way the clubs compounded class inequality was at least as bad as how they codified unequal gender power dynamics, where men literally held the keys to social life.”
While several alumni said they would not be opposed to making their clubs co-ed, many chafed at the idea of Harvard attempting to force the clubs to change their membership policies.
“I think if the clubs want to voluntarily integrate, fine and dandy. We asked [the undergraduate members] over the years what they wanted to do because we’re old dinosaurs, you know, we’re the ancients,” Cassedy said.
Zofnass questioned why women’s organizations, like sororities and female final clubs, should have been sanctioned at all. One of his daughters, Rebecca A. Zofnass ’09, was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta; she said she supported the new sanctions, and called the “death sentence for sororities” a “necessary evil.”
“I wish that there was another solution to the fact that the social scene at Harvard has always revolved around final clubs and that is a male-dominated scene,” Rebecca Zofnass said. “But I understand that after 30 years of trying to make the clubs go co-ed, this is the only option left.”
In the long term, Paul Zofnass said he thought the policy change was the right decision.
“We do need to be more open minded, so Harvard taking a lead on it is very important in terms of sending the right message, but in doing so not everything will be perfect,” Zofnass said.
FREE HARVARD, FREE ASSOCIATION
As the debate about the future of undergraduate social life rages on newspaper editorial pages and blogs across the Internet, it is also shaping an unusually contentious race for Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body.
Many critics of the changes have decried the sanctions as an attack on the freedom of association and the First Amendment. In a statement Monday, Stuart S. Taylor, Jr., Lee C. Cheng ’93, and Ron K. Unz ’83—all candidates on the outsider “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” ticket—joined that chorus of critics. They wrote that they were “appalled and dismayed” by the policy,
“The Harvard administration has way, way overreached, and is teaching a lesson not about honoring and respecting difference of perspective and preferences, but on how power can be abused to enforce monolithic ways of thinking and living,” the statement reads. Unz and Cheng said they were not members of final clubs or fraternities as undergraduates; Taylor was a member of an eating club, which is a social organization at Princeton.
The statement is a departure from the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” ticket’s typical adherence to its dual-pronged message. While the five candidates have largely stuck to their two shared tenets—to make undergraduate tuition free and probe Harvard’s admissions processes for racial bias—several, including Taylor and Unz, have recently criticized what Taylor called a “disrespect for civil liberties” on campus.
Broadening the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” message, Taylor said, may curry favor with voters angry about the new policy.
“I think there are a lot of alumni who feel the way we do about this and a lot of other things, and since this is a hot controversy, bringing it to their attention might help our candidacies,” Taylor said.
The arguments that Taylor, Cheng, Unz make are familiar to some those of club graduates. Myers called Harvard’s sanctions a threat to first amendment values. Dale A. Jenkins ’60, who is a Fly Club graduate member, also argued that joining a club fell under the First Amendment’s right to assembly.
“You have this other question which is right to assembly. There’s a legal criteria that might be applied,” Jenkins said. “We’re talking about human nature and sociology. People of like interests, associations, backgrounds, whatever group, they’re naturally going to gravitate together, and there’s no way of legislating that away.”
But other alumni, like Jackson M. Kernion ’12, said it should fall well within the University’s power to combat prejudicial associations. Kernion said he was not a member of a final club.
“The matter is just whether or not it makes sense for a university to ban gender discrimination, and if you think about it, that is important for a place like Harvard to do,” Kernion said.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Beyond where alumni place their vote for the Board of Overseers, the sanctions against unrecognized single-sex social groups has also influenced where some alumni put their money.
Stephen G. Lookner ’93, a graduate student who was not a member of a club, said he takes strong issue with Khurana and Faust’s defense of the policy.
“Each of these things makes me feel worse about the school: the policy itself, the incredibly poor argument, the arrogance of thinking it’s okay for them to dictate to student organizations who they can have, the whole thing is just terrible to me,” Lookner said.
Incensed, Lookner wrote a letter to both Faust and Khurana declaring that he would withhold future donations to the University until the policy is changed.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that Harvard did not desire to “regulate the internal affairs of the unrecognized social organizations.”
“[T]hey retain the authority to set their membership criteria, even as the College will continue to urge them to adopt inclusive and non-discriminatory policies,” Dane wrote. “Likewise, students will be able to continue to join these organizations and remain in good academic standing with the College.”
Now halfway through its record-breaking capital campaign, the University is relying on alumni donations to fund remaining priorities including House renewal, the Allston science complex, and financial aid.
Still, Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 said Khurana and Faust did not weigh the potential impact on fundraising when formulating the recommendations.
“When institutional leadership is thinking of a recommendation like this… fundraising is not the driving force behind it. They didn't take an action either because they thought it would help or harm fundraising and I think that’s the right thing to do,” Rogers said. “Will there be some people who will stop giving? I am sure that there will be some.”
Jenkins had similar expectations. “I think some people might decide that their contributions to the Harvard College Fund might be better diverted to their clubs,” he said.
But Kernion, a recent graduate, said the policy announcement made him more inclined to give to his alma mater.
“I’m a poor grad student so I don’t have money, but if I had money, I would be giving a ton of money to Harvard right now,” Kernion said. “It’s the first time I’ve been proud of Harvard as an alumni.”
Myers, though, said he would be taking a different tack.
“I have told all of my friends in the Porcellian Club that I would prefer to just give Harvard the finger,” he said. “It’s easy; it’s fun; it doesn’t cost anything.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite coming out on top in game two to force a third game, Harvard (29-17, 16-4 Ivy League) fell to Princeton (23-26, 14-6) 8-3, giving the South Division Champion Tigers the Ivy League title after defeating the North Division Champion Crimson two games to one.
“Being in the Ivy Championship series is an honor and testament to the hard work our team put in over the past year,” co-captain Morgan Groom said. “Unfortunately things didn’t go the way we wanted them to, but I’m proud of the grit our team showed, not just this weekend but all season.”
Princeton 8, Harvard 3
The Tigers took command of the game early, scoring all of their runs in the second inning. Princeton’s Keeley Walsh set the standard for the inning with a leadoff double and was the first Tiger to score after a single by Marissa Reynolds. Despite going to the bullpen early after freshman Sarah Smith allowed three runs, junior Taylor Cabe was unable to slow the Tiger’s hot bats. Eight runs had crossed the plate by the time the team recorded its third out.
Harvard’s offense finally broke through in the bottom of the fifth, as freshman Meaghan Lantz walked to start the inning. A series of small-ball plays brought Lantz home —moving to second on a sacrifice bunt, third on a single, and home on a fielder’s choice.
The Crimson knocked in another two runs in the bottom of the sixth, but Harvard was unable to rally for the win and Princeton took home the Ivy League title.
“We may not have won the championship but we did accomplish a lot of good things that we'll take into next year so we can win the championship,” Rich said. “It was a tough loss but this team showed a lot of grit, and I think this season we proved that we are a big force and we are looking forward to next season.”
Harvard 7, Princeton 1
The Crimson responded to the opening loss with strong bats. Harvard was leading Princeton 7-1 when in the bottom of the sixth the umpires called the game due to darkness. The game was scheduled to continue the next day Sunday May 8th at 3:30, but rain pushed the game back to Monday at noon.
“Delays demand additional focus from teams, and I felt we kept that focus,” Groom said.
Before the interruption, Kaplan, junior Giana Panariello, and co-captain Zoe Galindo recorded two hits apiece, with both of Panariello’s hits driving a runner home for a game-high two RBIs.
Junior Taylor Cabe started in the circle pitching two strikeouts and allowing five hits and one run over five innings. Smith relieved Cabe and closed the game with one strikeout and no hits.
The Crimson notched two hits and scored a run to start off the game, with Rich making it home after Lantz was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded. Harvard scored two more runs in the third to put the Crimson up, 3-0.
Harvard increased its lead to 5-0 in the top of the fourth, as Galindo led off the inning with triple and Kaplan followed suit with a triple of her own to drive the Las Vegas, Nev. senior home. Kaplan then scored after a sacrifice fly by Rich.
Princeton answered with its first run in the bottom of the fifth, but the Crimson halted the tigers momentum with two more runs in the top of the sixth to widen the spread.
Cabe was three pitches into the sixth inning when umpires postponed the game. The last inning and a half continued on Monday with no hits on either side, forcing a third game in the series.
Princeton 2 Harvard 1
Kaplan led the offense with a game-high three hits in the opening contest against the Tigers. Rich, Panariello, Freshman Elizabeth Shively, and Senior Haley Davis all tallied a hit for the Crimson with Davis’s single driving in Harvard’s sole run of the game. The Crimson was unable to match Princeton two solo homers falling 2-1 to the Tigers.
Groom started on the mound and pitched for the first four innings, tossing two strikeouts while letting up four hits and two runs. Groom was relieved one out into the fifth by freshman Sarah Smith, who earned two strikeouts and held Princeton to no hits for the rest of the game.
A rain delay stopped play for nearly two hours in the bottom of the fifth with one out on the board for Harvard. When the game resumed, the Harvard offensive play picked up recording four hits and their only run of the contest. Despite out hitting the Tigers 7-4, Harvard was unable to pull out the win combining to leave four runners on base in the fifth and sixth innings.

1995. That was the last time a Harvard player managed to put up nine goals in one game, as Jamie Ames ’95 found the back of the net nine times against Yale in an 18-7 victory.
It took 11 years for a Crimson player to replicate the feat, and this time the team needed every single tally. Sophomore attackman Morgan Cheek lit up then-No. 2/2 Brown, which boasted a defense allowing less than nine goals-per-game, for nine scores and 10 points to lead Harvard to victory. It was only the second time that the Crimson defeated a No. 2 ranked team since coach Chris Wojcik ’96 joined the program in 2011.
“I just went out and played like I had nothing to lose,” Cheek said. “Lots of credit to my teammates for setting me up with some great opportunities, and from there, it was mainly just going out and playing fearlessly.”
Going into the game, most of the spotlight was on the Bears attacking duo of junior Dylan Molloy, who entered the tournament as the freshly-minted Ancient Eight Player of the Year, and senior Kylor Bellistri, an All-Ivy honorable mention. The pair came in ranked first and second in the nation, respectively, in both points and goals, with Molloy also leading the NCAA in assists.
Cheek, who was named to the All-Ivy second team, came in with 26 goals to his name–less than half of the totals Molloy and Bellistri put up–and his previous season high for goals scored in an individual game stood at four in a losing effort against Yale just a week before.
“All-Ivy meant a lot to me, it validated all the work I put in over the off season,” Cheek said. “Backing it up with a performance like that was obviously great but being selected to begin with was an honor.”
While the Wellesley, Mass. native had yet to put up a prolific performance, Wojcik felt the signs were evident in practice.
“[Cheek] had a great week in practice, and he came into the game with a ton of confidence.” Wojcik said on Friday. “You could see that translate onto the field, with the way he took over the game.”
With the Crimson down 8-5 to Brown at the half, Cheek had already compiled four goals in the first half hour, matching Molloy goal-for-goal to keep Harvard alive. It was in the third quarter, however, the sophomore sparked the Crimson’s upset hopes. Just 13 seconds into the period, the attackman found the back of the net on the man-advantage before senior Deke Burns brought Harvard within one just after five minutes had passed in the stanza.
It was all Cheek from there on out, as the sophomore added three more scores in the span of six-and-a-half minutes, including one while the Crimson was down a man following a penalty on senior midfielder Ian Ardrey, to give his team a 10-8 lead at the end of the stanza.
“The way he was getting his shots all week, especially on Thursday, you felt like he was going to have a good game” Wojcik said.
A pair of goals in the final period secured the upset for Harvard and gave Cheek the last of his nine goals, tied for the most goals scored in one game by a Harvard player and the all-time best in Ancient Eight tournament history.The sophomore singlehandedly outscored the most potent offense in the nation in the last 30 minutes, tallying five goals in the second half while Molloy, Bellistri, and the Bears attacking unit was held to just four goals on their home turf.
Though the season came to a disappointing end a few days later with a 14-9 loss to No. 7/6 Yale in the tournament final, where Cheek was held to just one goal and one assist, it was a season to remember for the sophomore.
After registering just 14 points his freshman year, the attackman ended his season with 60 points off of 36 goals and 24 assists, second-highest on the team in those categories behind senior and Tewaaraton Award nominee Devin Dwyer.
With the Crimson losing one of its most impressive classes this year, packed with highly recruited and talented seniors such as Dwyer, Stephen Jahelka, Bobby Duvnjak, Walker Kirby, Will Walker, and several others, Cheek figures to be a pivotal figure for Harvard during his final two years with the Crimson.
While only time will tell what direction the team takes following this season, having a player like Cheek is a good place to start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just one year ago, a 32-goal campaign landed Jimmy Vesey a spot on the stage at Matthews Arena, where the Hobey Baker Award was set to be handed to college hockey’s Most Valuable Player.
But Vesey hardly needed to prepare a speech. No one gave Harvard’s star forward a shot at winning the award, not even Vesey himself. Boston University’s freshman phenom, Jack Eichel, became just the second rookie to hear his name called by the Hobey committee, and no one batted an eye.
One year later and over 1,000 miles further south, the Hobey ceremony at the Tampa Theater possessed a familiar ambience. Michigan freshman Kyle Connor was not the sure bet that Eichel was, but with the rookie netting 71 points in 38 games, practically everyone considered the Wolverines’ top playmaker to be the overwhelming favorite.
But this time, Vesey was not counting himself out.
“I thought I definitely had a chance,” Vesey told The Crimson in April. “I don’t know, I just thought that since I was a finalist for a second year in a row, I don’t know if they would’ve brought me all the way down there to lose.”
They didn’t.
In a surprise decision that sent shockwaves across college hockey, Vesey was named the recipient of the 2016 Hobey Baker Award, joining Mark Fusco ’83, Scott Fusco ’86, and Lane MacDonald ’88-’89 in Harvard’s club of Hobey winners.
All four winners were honored for their contributions to the program Monday evening at a reception put on by the Friends of Harvard Hockey at the Downtown Harvard Club of Boston. But the man of the hour was certainly Vesey.
“I was so hopeful Jimmy was going to win it because I thought he was so deserving,” MacDonald said in April. “He is the best player in college hockey. But you don’t win that award unless you’re a high quality individual off the ice, and that’s both as a person and as a leader. And Jimmy obviously gets high marks in every one of those categories.”
By now, Vesey’s narrative is well known. The Charlestown native was drafted to the National Hockey League in 2012 by the Nashville Predators, who offered Vesey a spot in their lineup after his junior season came to a close. But Vesey ultimately opted to return to school for his senior season.
Named a captain for his final year, Vesey netted 24 goals and 22 assists in 33 games, leading the Crimson to its second consecutive appearance in the NCAA tournament. And for the second time in as many years, Vesey was named a first-team All-American, ECAC and Ivy League Player of the Year, and the recipient of the Walter Brown Award as the top American-born player in New England.
Introducing Vesey at the podium on Monday in front of roughly 50 Harvard hockey alumni and members of the Vesey family, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 emphasized his star forward’s character, likening it to that of MacDonald, his teammate on the Crimson’s national-championship-winning team in 1989.
“The accomplishments were great, but kind of like Lane, he kept it out of the locker room,” Donato said. “He was a great teammate and really loved putting on that Harvard jersey every night, which I think is a certain common thread for people in this room.”
Vesey is set to graduate on May 26, which also happens to be his birthday. Then on June 2, he and his family will travel to Minneapolis for the official Hobey Baker Memorial Award ceremony, where he will receive a personalized version of the trophy.
But after that, Vesey will get back to preparing for the NHL career that awaits him. After indicating in March that he would not be signing with the Predators, Vesey is expected to become an unrestricted free agent in August. Nashville maintains “the exclusive rights of negotiation” for Vesey’s services through Aug. 15, but after that, Vesey will be able to negotiate with the other 29 teams in the league.
“Something that’s good about the August 15 thing is at that point, the NHL Draft’s over, and July 1 is also a big day for free agents in the NHL,” Vesey said. “So when August rolls around, each team pretty much is going to have their roster set. So I think I’ll start considering it, which team, closer to the date.”
Vesey told The Boston Herald on Monday that he thinks the Boston Bruins will definitely be on his list when that time comes. Bruins general manager Don Sweeney ’88, a former Harvard defenseman, was seen chatting with Vesey for a few minutes near the end of the event.
Nonetheless, the Bruins will likely have plenty of competition for Vesey’s services come August. But in the end, only Vesey can choose his final landing spot.
“He’s created a lot of options for himself,” MacDonald said. “He can pick his team, and he can pick the situation that’s best for him. And he’s earned that right by the decisions he’s made.”
“I respect him a ton because so many people will want to just sign contracts, get checks, play the game, get to the NHL,” he added in reference to Vesey’s decision not to sign immediately with Nashville. “But it really is a marathon rather than a sprint in terms of life in so many respects.”
