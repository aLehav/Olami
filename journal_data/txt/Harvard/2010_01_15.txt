After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Larry D. Arbuthnott ’10 was woken from his afternoon nap by his grandmother's worried shrill: “Turn on the news! I think there's been an earthquake in Haiti.”
As he came to his senses on that cold Tuesday evening in his New Jersey home, Arbuthnott begrudgingly tuned in to CNN. Moments later, he snapped into rapt attention.
“'This isn’t real,'" Arbuthnott recalls thinking. "'I was just in the country. Haiti? What do you mean Haiti?'”
But the situation, despite its seeming trappings of sheer impossibility, was starkly real on the television screen before him. The capital of his mother's native country—a place that Arbuthnott had recently visited for the first time over New Year's for a little over a week—had suffered a 7.0 magnitude earthquake.
A mere week had passed since Arbuthnott's return to the United States.
The cataclysmic earthquake that hit Port-au-Prince at 4:53 p.m. on Jan. 12  unleashed devastation in a country that was already among the poorest in the hemisphere. It came without warning, Arbuthnott said.
"No one thinks of earthquakes in the Caribbean. It's not like it was a hurricane—it's not hurricane season. It was like someone told me a volcano erupted in the middle of the island," said Arbuthnott, whose mother, on a bus from New York, had not yet heard the news at the time of his television screening.
But word has spread fast—landing on the front page of major newspapers, traveling into the confines of Harvard Yard, and even prompting University President Drew G. Faust to send a statement on Thursday asking the community to contribute to relief efforts on behalf of a shaken nation. And the Harvard community has done just that.
HANDS THAT HELP
Not long after the earthquake subsided, some members of the Harvard community raced to the home of destruction to provide the aid that Haiti desperately needed.
Two faculty members from the Medical School traveled to Haiti on Wednesday, joining the staff of Partners In Health—a non-profit Harvard affiliate—in providing aid to the residents of the mountainous Central Plateau through its non-governmental health clinics.
“We are well-established in Haiti,” said Andrew R. Marx, director of communications at PIH . “We have a network of hospitals to provide emergency assistance."
The relief efforts of PIH can be described as a two-pronged goal, Marx said. First, the organization seeks to strengthen the health care system in Haiti to facilitate the clinics' ability to attend to the influx of people expected by the rescue team. The organization is bringing in extra surgeons to staff the clinic and more supplies to stock the warehouse, according to Marx.
PIH's second approach, he said, is the establishment of facilities in Port-au-Prince to bolster emergency treatment and to identify the patients who require more advanced surgery and must be transported to the Plateau. On Thursday night, PIH posted a lengthy list of immediate needs on its Web site, citing concerns related to transportation and supplies.
Marx said that PIH has about 4,000 people working in Haiti, including 100 doctors and 600 nurses. But the figures seem hopelessly slim when situated beside the several million in need and the tens of thousands now dead.
MAKING CONNECTIONS
To facilitate the communication and coordination end of PIH's operation, along with the operation of other Harvard-affiliated health institutions, Harvard Humanitarian Initiative—a University-wide academic and research center for response to humanitarian crises—is working with its partners at Harvard, PIH, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Hospital by providing information to them after assessing Haiti's needs.
“We are taking part in a coordinated response effort," said Vincenzo Bollettino, director of programs and administration at HHI.
HHI is also creating a roster of medical and public health volunteers that includes both people currently working on the relief effort and individuals who have volunteered to help, according to Bollettino. These certified medical, surgical, and public health personnel are available for deployment to Haiti when the need arises.
But the most immediate need in Haiti, according to both Marx and Bollettino, is money—the quickest route to supplying the needs of Haitians.
"There is no clean water, which is a major public health hazard,” Marx said. “It’s been cold. They don’t have blankets.”
Though Haiti currently possesses a decent stock of medical supplies and the PIH clinics have an adequately stocked warehouse, resources eventually become insufficient, according to Marx.
COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS
Shellonda M. Anderson ’11, president of the Harvard Caribbean Club, has been working with the heads of other organizations on campus to coordinate relief efforts on campus.
Members of the HCC—along with the Harvard African Students Association, the Harvard Haitian Alliance, the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, the Harvard South Asian Men’s Collective, the Harvard Undergraduate Council, as well as many more student and community organizations—have their minds set on a tangible response. 
Amongst the projects the HCC is trying to coordinate are a supply drive and a benefit concert, according to Anderson.
“I think it’s a question of what is needed right now,” said R. Vanessa Alix ’10, an HAA member who has relatives in Haiti. “People in Boston understand that there is no food, no water. If they can’t donate $10,000, then donating 10 cases of water is a tangible alternative."
"For those who can't give, some people are giving their prayers," Alix added.
Anderson said that the organizations are also working together to ensure that Harvard students, and even those beyond its gates, do not forget the disaster in Haiti after the next few weeks.
"The Harvard Haitian Alliance is a really small organization," Anderson said. "It's often overlooked. [The earthquake's] a tragedy, but at the same time it's an opportunity for the school to see how much of an impact it's had on the entire world."
CONTINUING HOPE
Watching CNN on that cold night was frustrating, Arbuthnott said, because there were no visuals, no pictures to help him envision the destruction in discussion on television. He recalled the shanty cement homes built on hillsides—and he feared the worst.
“The hardest part in this entire thing is not knowing, because you don't know what is going on,” said Alix, whose parents own orphanages and schools in Haiti. “There are so many people I know who have lost someone, or they know people who have lost someone. There are people who are dying who need to be helped.”
“I hope it awakens Americans and the world to a fixable problem,” Arbuthnott said. “The people there are very strong-willed, but you can’t just provide aid and walk away.”
Arbuthnott said that before arriving in Haiti on Dec. 27, 2009, his family had told him about the hope expressed by the natives, despite their poverty, even before the earthquake struck.
“There was a sense of optimism," Arbuthnott said. "I felt it when I was there."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College will revive its transfer admissions program after a two-year hiatus, welcoming applications this spring for entrance in the fall of 2010, University officials announced today.
A recent review has determined that an adequate amount of residential space is available for a small incoming class of transfers, according to an online statement posted this afternoon by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
In March 2008, the admissions office had announced that it would not be accepting any transfer students for the next two years because the undergraduate Houses could not accommodate more people.
The College now expects to admit between 10 and 20 students who have completed one to two years of study at another college or university, according to Director of Transfer Admissions E. Marlene Vergara Rotner.
Transfer candidates will have until March 15 to complete their applications, and admissions decisions will be made by June 1, according to Rotner, who affirmed that Harvard’s financial aid policies will apply to incoming transfer students.
“We will be looking at candidates with clearly developing academic interests who will be well served by Harvard, people who have a clear view of what they want to pursue intellectually at Harvard,” Rotner said.
All transfer students admitted this year under the resuscitated program must assume resident status in one of the Houses on campus, according to the deans' statement.
“We believe that the residential experience is part of undergraduate education. We can’t really separate the two,” said Joshua G. McIntosh, associate dean of student life. “We wouldn’t want to admit transfers if we didn’t have space for them residentially.”
Between 1,000 and 1,300 students per year have applied for a spot among the transfer class in the past, according to Rotner. Nevertheless, the admissions office has “no way of knowing” how the two-year suspension of the program will affect the number of applications the College will receive, she added.
In the past, Harvard has accepted as many as 75 transfer students in a year. The Crimson reported in 2008 that such notable alumni as John F. Kennedy ’40, Henry A. Kissinger ’50, and W.E.B. DuBois, Class of 1890, came to Harvard as transfer students.
At other Ivy League schools, policies on transfer admissions run the gamut: Yale boasts a 2 to 4 percent transfer acceptance rate and accepts 18 to 35 transfer students each year, according to its Web site, and Cornell welcomed 569 transfer students in the fall of 2009. Princeton is the only Ivy League school which does not currently have a program of transfer admissions.

Most of us can remember spending prefrosh weekend wandering around the Yard with bright red folders that our hosts weren't merciful enough to tell us to leave in our rooms. That special weekend in spring has always formally been called the "April Visiting Program"—but it looks like that might change soon.
In an attempt to transform the title of the weekend into "something that is hopefully more fun, exciting, and enticing," the Undergraduate Admissions Council e-mailed its members asking for new name ideas. They have until Jan. 24 to respond, which will give the council a week to poll the rest of the student body before coming to a decision by Feb. 1.
The sample name offered in the e-mail was "Crimson Campus Close-up."  That's all right, but here are a couple more ideas we came up with.
The Name: Rage Without the ‘Rents
What It Says: For those of you who didn’t drink in high school, here’s your chance to do so without having to worry about getting caught by your parents. Just make sure not to give them a late-night call. With any luck, your hosts will take it upon themselves to ensure that you pregame right. If you are not so fortunate, find one of the 50 new best friends that you met at the regional reception and go out with them.
The Name: Awkward Greetings, Meaningless Meetings
What It Says: If you venture into the smaller receptions, you will potentially find yourself standing in an uncomfortable circle of five other people, unsure of what to talk about. You’re going to meet far too many people within a span of three days, most of whom you won’t remember when you actually get here in September. Names are not important.
The Name: Answer “Accepted”
What It Says: We want you, you want us. When upperclassmen ask you which box you're going to check on the response form, tell them you’ve accepted and will be a student in the fall. No one wants to hear you rattle off the Ivies you’re debating over, so humor us. It will make us happy, and we won't know if you’re lying anyway.
The Name: No Swipe, No Keys, No Annenberg Fees
What It Says: While you won’t be able to get into buildings without begging an upperclassman, and you'll probably be locked out of your room until your host stumbles in drunk at four in the morning, at least you won’t have to pay for food at the ‘berg.
