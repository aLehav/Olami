Now in the middle of her second headlining tour in the last two years, Bishop Briggs has a work ethic like no other. Her debut album “Church of Scars” is only 18 months old and Bishop Briggs is already headlining shows across the country to accompany her second album “Champion,” set to be released next month. On Oct. 16, the British-born artist brought her “Champion” tour to Boston’s House of Blues.
Accompanying Bishop Briggs on this tour are two smaller alternative artists, Jax Anderson and Miya Folick. Anderson set a high-energy tone for the rest of the show with her upbeat songs and calls for the audience to dance. Folick followed Anderson, enchanting the crowd with her eerie vocals and relatable anecdotes. After playing drastically different but equally entertaining sets, the two artists went to their merchandise tables to meet with fans as Bishop Briggs took to the stage.
Bishop Briggs is not one to shy away from the dramatic. Her performance began with a giant LED screen featuring a clock and, after a 10 minute countdown, the screen played a montage of clips from various movies including “Coraline” and “Black Swan.” The movie clips then transitioned into a vintage video game screen that read “Song Selection: Champion.” Briggs then appeared on stage and began her set with “Champion,” the first single off her upcoming second album.
Briggs’ performance was full of the same high energy that fans who went to her 2018 headline tour would recognize. Running across the stage, and sometimes even in place, Briggs very impressively sang each song with the same power vocals that can be heard on her records. Despite practically running miles on stage for 90 minutes, Briggs maintained her energy and never once lost her breath or faltered in her vocals as she belted out her lyrics. What makes the 27-year-old singer even more impressive is her ability to stay optimistic and upbeat when, at times, the crowd did not reciprocate her energy. Rather than let a lukewarm crowd bring her down, Briggs fueled herself up and shifted the tone of the house.
In order to hold onto her audience’s attention, Briggs perfectly coupled her singing with audience engagement and fun visuals on the LED screen behind her. A corresponding video accompanied each song on the screen, visually stimulating but not so much as to distract from the singer’s performance. In between tunes, Briggs showed her overwhelming gratitude to everyone involved in her tour from her band to her openers, from her fans to the crew member who brought her a stool to sit on for an acoustic performance of her song “Dream.”
Briggs played perfect mix of well known songs from her first album and EP, the singles off of “Champion,” and unreleased songs from her forthcoming album. By performing both her older and newer songs, she both ensured that her fans could sing along and generated further excitement for her next album’s release. Along with her own songs, Briggs also included a medley of popular emo songs in her set. The crowd not only had the chance to sing Briggs’s hit singles such as “White Flag” and “Wild Horses,” but they also got to sing “Stressed Out” by Twenty One Pilots, “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” by Panic! At the Disco, and the classic “Welcome to the Black Parade” by My Chemical Romance — a novelty considering the band broke up in 2013. After performing the covers, Briggs thanked both her audience and band for allowing her to live out her “emo dream.”
Throughout her show, Briggs attended to every aspect of her performance, overlooking no details. From the video screen behind her to the cover medley, from making sure to point out her all-women lineup to thanking her fans after every single song, Bishop Briggs proved to the audience that she does not take her success for granted and that she deserves to be onstage. After leaving the stage and returning with a joke about how still has to play her hit song “River,” Briggs closed the night with a new song from “Champion” that she co-wrote with singer-songwriter K.Flay before launching into her most popular song of the night. Ending the show with just as much, if not more, energy than she started with, Bishop Briggs left her fans buzzing with excitement and ready to download her new album the second Nov. 8 comes around.

Selena Gomez is back. After a four-year hiatus, she dropped two new songs, “Lose You to Love Me” and “Look at Her Now,” the first two singles off her forthcoming third studio album. Since the release of her second album “Revival,” Gomez stayed on the radio primarily through collaborations with DJs like Kygo and Marshmello. One would expect her first independent singles in years to be songs that could only come from Gomez’s voice alone, but there is nothing unique about either of them.
In “Lose You to Love Me,” it’s clear that Gomez has worked hard to step out of her comfort zone. Her vocals have improved significantly from “Revival,” particularly her upper range, and the backing track is mostly comprised of piano, something not usually featured in her music.
While the verses may be in the vein of the break-up ballad she is going for, the choruses might as well be another DJ track. This track resembles a mellow version of “It Ain’t Me,” her 2016 collaboration with Kygo, with the same lines repeated over and over again and layered on top of each other. The chorus of “Lose You to Love Me” is seven words long (eight if “yeah” qualifies as a word). That’s not the chorus of a ballad; it’s barely even a sentence. Gomez, Julia Michaels, and Justin Tranter (the writing team behind both singles) simply mash the title in different fractional phrases, tape them back together, and call it a chorus. That process may end up creating a hook, but it has the side-effect of making all of Gomez’s songs sound the same, independent releases and collaborations alike.
“Look at Her Now” tries to be unique in its lyricism, with Gomez referring to herself in the third-person, but it’s a concept that’s been done to death already. While some of the lyrics may be biting (“It was her first real lover, his too ‘til he had another”) the song is generic and dragged down by its chorus. The semi-rhythmic “Mm-mm”s are not aggressive enough to make a dance beat nor lyrical enough to make them actually fun to listen to. They come across as childish, the lyrical embodiment of wagging her finger and telling-off her ex for being a bad boyfriend.
The conversation around these songs so far has primarily focused on the subject, purportedly her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber, whose 2015 album “Purpose” addresses the couple’s breakup. It’s great publicity, and it’s valid for Gomez to want to represent her side of the story. In “Lose You to Love Me,” she finds a particularly good line (“In two months, you replaced us”) by cutting the track and layering her vocals in harmony to draw attention to it. Drama entices the general public, and be it a genuine or calculated move, it achieves the desired effect.
But what these songs lack is any sense of style. There is nothing about either “Lose You to Love Me” or “Look at Her Now” that is identifiably Selena Gomez, but, to be fair, no one knows what something Selena Gomez sounds like. She has failed thus far to truly distinguish herself from any of her pop star peers. Both of these songs could have easily been another DJ collaboration single about a generic break-up, so what was the point in building up expectations for a solo Selena release?
Neither single is objectively bad, but they’re both entirely underwhelming and forgettable. Gomez isn’t stepping out of her comfort zone per se. She’s getting closer to the edge, but after a four-year wait, it’s not enough.

The atmosphere at TD Garden ahead of Bon Iver’s Oct. 15 performance felt isolating. Smoke from Feist’s opening set and the illicit activity of individual audience members clouded the air like the aftermath of a fire. The venue divided the floor into eight seated sections, eliminating the communal nature of a pit. Two video screens displayed video footage of a solitary man shooting free throws on a desolate basketball court as a graphic tracked his performance. Each successful shot was accompanied by cheers in other cities, but Boston remained silent. These conditions fostered a growing sense of dread, suggesting that Bon Iver didn’t belong in the cavernous arena fit for nearly 20,000 people.
Bon Iver’s music evokes feelings of isolation and introspection. The story behind the project’s first album, 2007’s “For Emma, Forever Ago,” is indie legend. Justin Vernon, kicked out of his band, dumped by his girlfriend, and suffering from mono, escaped to northwest Wisconsin to record a painfully beautiful set of songs centered on loss, despair, and acceptance. The album cover’s frosted windowpane served as a hallmark of winter, making “For Emma” the kind of album best enjoyed with a hot beverage in a cozy armchair by the fireplace while snow falls outside. Spring came with Bon Iver’s second, self-titled record in 2011. Bon Iver matured sonically with more elaborate instrumentation, and naming each song after a place implied a reentry into society after isolation in the cabin. 2016’s “22, A Million” featured opaque song titles and embraced an electronic, modernist approach, culminating in a sound the band described as that of an “unhinged summer.” The trio of albums seemed to point to an even more elusive and experimental sound from their next release.
Instead, September’s “i,i” blended the orchestral folkiness of their self-titled album with the progressive structures of “22, A Million.” The album begins with songs like “iMi” and “We” that lean on samples and vocal modifications and transitions to a more traditional-sounding back half. Even there, the collectivist message of “Salem” and saxophone solo of “Sh’Diah” demonstrate the project’s evolution over time. Similar to The National’s “I Am Easy to Find,” Bon Iver have stayed fresh by expanding its scope and adding new voices. The biggest question for the band, however, was whether that message would translate in a hockey arena.
To prep for its biggest tour yet, Bon Iver invested heavily in its tech. The band used a sound system called L-ISA that created a stereo sound throughout the arena, allowing the audience to distinctly hear where each sound on the stage came from — in effect, giving the balcony the acoustics of floor seats. They also installed moving, overhead mirrors that dynamically reflected light around the arena. The mirrors adapted to each song, creating ornate displays throughout the set. These advancements created a unique concert experience and gave Bon Iver the ability to command such a large venue.
And command they did. The group’s set demonstrated that they were more than just smoke and mirrors. Vernon, admitting Bon Iver are “not the usual suspects in a big ol’ place like this,” nevertheless brought commanding vocals and a gripping falsetto to the stage. Band members Sean Carey (keyboard) and Matthew McCaughan (drums) impressed during full-band renditions of new songs “Holyfields,” and “We.” The band members brought tremendous energy during songs like main set closer “Naeem,” yelling with Vernon during its anthemic chorus.
Bon Iver also shined during reimagined versions of older songs. “Blood Bank,” a song Vernon chose not to release on “For Emma,” underwent a hard-rock makeover, complete with a guitar solo and extended jam. On “Perth,” McCaughan’s drums were somehow even more dominant than on the studio version. The band demonstrated the elasticity of “For Emma” by performing an eerie rendition of “Lump Sum,” proving that even Vernon’s most intimate songs can play to the largest of audiences.
All this being said, the highlights of the night were Vernon’s solo efforts. “715 - CR∑∑KS,” a vocal powerhouse off “22, A Million,” took on new life as Vernon manipulated his Messina, an autotuner that preserves the original voice but adds in real-time harmonies. Vernon also gave an emotional performance of his most popular song, “Skinny Love,” with just his voice and acoustic guitar. The raw passion behind the “For Emma” cut floated throughout the arena. On the other hand, the meandering “____45_____” made for an interesting, but unfit encore — the closest thing to a misstep all night.
Bon Iver’s performance at TD Garden was a testament to their immense growth. The project that started in a hunting cabin morphed into a collaborative band that emphasized togetherness. Nowhere was this more evident than the closer, “RABi,” which Vernon kicked off by proclaiming that “Life is long. Be good to each other and don’t be afraid of what comes after.” In response to the band repeatedly teasing “So what of this release?” between verses, Vernon finished by singing that “Well, it’s all fine and we’re all fine anyway.” An elaborate light display illuminated most of the audience standing in unison, the crowd’s transition from isolation to solidarity mirroring Bon Iver’s.

Kanye West’s evolution, among celebrities, is remarkable. The rapper knows how to hold the limelight, be it through music or public controversy — playing it safe has never been his brand. West expresses himself in full, from his 2009 Taylor Swift controversy to his avid endorsement of Trump. This time around, it’s his love for Jesus. The rapper with iconic outspokenness, fashion sense, and sampling prowess made an on-brand move with his unexpectedly devout album “Jesus Is King.” While it may be a noteworthy part of his artistic development, the album nonetheless isolates much of his fanbase.
“Jesus is King” is a 180-degree reversal from the old Kanye. On his 2010 album “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” West fetishizes the satanic, from “Devil in a New Dress” to “Hell of a Life,” and much of that album’s lyrics, along with those of more recent albums, promoted a starkly different array of values than those that guide “Jesus is King.” Reportedly, Kanye asked people producing the album not to have premarital sex and in “Closed on Sunday,” he asks his spouse Kim Kardashian West to stop taking nude selfies, aligning himself with what appear to be newfound conservative values per his re-identification with Christianity.
In the past, West’s more religious songs (see: “Ultralight Beam,” “Jesus Walks”) express a desire for religious uplift but still appear with near-nude album art or alongside explicit lyrics (i.e. in “Father Stretch My Hands,” gospel song followed by a remark about a model who bleached her asshole). In “Hands On,” Kanye shouts out his progress, singing, “Told the Devil I’m going on a strike… / I’ve been working for you my whole life.” Kanye indicates that this album is about a personal revelation — it intentionally fails to meet fans’ expectations. Many may have felt that Kanye disappointed with this album but, by ignoring their expectations, Kanye makes it seem that he’s elevated himself above money-making incentives, demonstrating a faithful commitment to his art (but perhaps still performatively so).
West drew upon the styles he employed skillfully in “The Life of Pablo” (2016) and “Ye” (2018). The opening sample of “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” incorporates gospel sound. His sampling of funk and soul band Father’s Children’s “Dirt and Grime” at the start of “Facts,” and gospel singer Shirley Ann Lee’s “Someday” at the start of “Ghost Town” rooted the album in the black, Christian musical tradition he draws on heavily in “Jesus is King.” West’s integration of gospel and choral vocalists into his tracks is one of the album’s greatest merits. “Sunday Service Choir” provides an uplifting, reverberating background sampling in the very first track, “Every Hour,” and, in “Hands On,” gospel singer Fred Hammond contributes a brief but deeply-felt feature.
The sound of “Jesus Is King” is expansive. “Follow God,” one of the best songs on the album, has a memorable background melody sampled from “Can You Lose by Following God” by “Whole Truth,” and an invigorating rhythm. “On God,” with a distinctive Pi'erre Bourne sound, overlays an upbeat, video-game-like sound with his rap. “Everything We Need” is a smooth, coherent montage of gospel, Kanye rap, and features from Ty Dolla $ign and up-and-comer Ant Clemons. A majority of the songs on this album are masterfully sung and produced — West’s voice and sampling alike.
It nonetheless disappoints that West’s lyrics are almost entirely about Christianity: about following God, Jesus being humanity’s collective savior, the moral obligation, sometimes unsettlingly, to align with the faith. Songs like “Closed on Sunday” that reference “Chick-fil-A,” a company with anti-LGBTQ views and investments, alienate a substantial portion of West’s listeners whose social and political views he tramples. West may have chosen to target only Christian fans, but not only the lyrics evangelizing, they are greatly lacking. The best examples of lyrical prowess tend not to be about God, and songs like “Jesus Is,” are limited to shallow, generic lyrics like “I know God is alive, yeah / He has opened up my vision.”
This album does not explicitly have an audience — Christian rap fans may or may not take a liking to it, but the lyrics are unrelatable and uninspiring for most Kanye fans. The creation of this album took a degree of audacity that many artists never would risk, and “Jesus Is King” merits respect at least for that reason.
West expresses the public’s expectation of him and perhaps fear of judgment as well — he sings on “Hands On” that the Christians would be the first to judge him. This music was not meant for the Ye fanbase; it’s just West personally evolving, in the public eye. His fans have the right to “miss the old Kanye,” but even if in “Jesus Is King” he takes a new direction, West’s music has been a blessing.

On Sep. 19, British singer-songwriter Rex Orange County posted a list of tour dates announcing his new album “Pony,” which dropped on Oct. 25, on his Instagram and racked up nearly 230,000 likes. Thousands of eager fans posted comments expressing their excitement for his shows and love for his music. With over 7 million monthly listeners on Spotify, it seems hard to believe that the 21-year-old artist only uploaded his first-ever, self-produced album to SoundCloud three years ago, but a quick listen to any of his songs explains his popularity — and his musical genius.
Rex Orange County, or Alexander O’Connor, earned his musical break after posting his album “bcos u will never b free” to the internet in 2016 that garnered the attention of musician Tyler, the Creator. The rapper e-mailed his praise, then flew O’Connor all the way from London to Los Angeles to collaborate on his upcoming album, “Flower Boy,” which also featured Frank Ocean, Lil Wayne, and A$AP Rocky. Following the success of “Flower Boy,” Rex Orange County grew his audience. When he released “Apricot Princess” in 2017, the album had the right foundation to peak at number eight on the US Independent Album chart ranks. In 2018, Rex Orange County dropped the single “Loving Is Easy,” which now boasts 162 million streams on Spotify — one of three songs from his discography that exceeds 100 million plays.
Given these facts, it’s worth asking the question: Why do people love Rex Orange County’s music so much?
One of his trademarks is his commitment to earnest lyrics. In an interview with The Guardian, he said that he’s “never been uncomfortable sharing stuff… I won’t be the kind of artist speaking in riddles all the time – it will be lyrics that make sense the moment I say them.” His tracks maintain a certain eloquence even when untangling feelings of obsessive infatuation, like in his single “Sunflower,” or promising to dedicate himself to a lover for years to come in “Happiness.” Rex also paints a relatable portrait of himself in “10/10,” in which he dives into his low moments and aspires to become a “ten.” His easy voice always speaks his words like poetry instead of singing them in a belt, and something about the intimacy of this sound charges his tracks with emotion.
Another unique characteristic of Rex Orange County that sets him apart from a number of popular artists today is his raw musical talent. Rex manages to emulate a one-of-a-kind quality one each of his tracks, which his experience at the prestigious BRIT School, with alma mater of artists like Adele and Jessie J, helped foster. One of four percussionists in his class year, the experience exposed him to a diverse array of musical genres that granted him the opportunity to participate in many projects. Rex Orange County’s background translates to many of his songs, which tend to musically convey full, winding narratives with multiple chapters, often marked through shifts in cadence, layers, tempo, or rhythm. Some notable examples of this musical story-telling appears in his single “Best Friend” and album opener “Apricot Princess.” Through his musical genius, Rex Orange County has somehow perfected the indie equivalent of an EDM beat drop.
Whether his music sounds like a jazz piece, a piano ballad, or a full orchestral symphony, Rex Orange County always creates tracks that are authentic and sincere. They resonate with the mushy, hard-to-say parts within all of us – Rex Orange County’s music does the talking so we don’t have to. Give the album “Pony” a listen and you’ll see why loving Rex Orange County is easy.

For most concertgoers, a night at the orchestra involves stuffy formalwear, overpriced refreshments, and row after row of graying heads in upholstered seats. In 1970, British rock group Electric Light Orchestra redefined the orchestral experience, stripping the music of ceremony and leaving only its spellbinding complexity behind. Founding members Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne had a clear goal in mind: to “pick up where the Beatles left off.” By combining seemingly incompatible sonic elements — the sophistication of classical and the gritty authenticity of rock — their sound belongs in a genre all its own. After Wood’s departure and a 13-year hiatus, the band rebranded as Jeff Lynne’s ELO. Their latest release, “From Out of Nowhere,” proves that nearly 50 years of music-making have yet to make a dent in their originality.
Despite Lynne’s claims that “From Out of Nowhere’ – that’s exactly where it came from,” the album’s symphonic polish can only be the result of his extensive industry experience. Along with writing, arranging, and producing each of its 10 tracks, Lynne plays almost every instrument himself, including guitars, bass, keyboards, and percussion. His reverence for music manifests in every painstakingly rendered note but never eclipses the emotional component of his work. Although Lynne’s mastery of compositional technique smacks of artifice, the depth and wonder of his songs are anything but artificial.
The introduction to the title track juxtaposes two guitar lines in a steady midtempo cross-rhythm, establishing momentum without devolving into frenzy. The melody fades out as Lynne’s vocals take its place and the arpeggiated accompaniment continues, its syncopation slyly disrupting listeners’ sense of pulse. The first verse’s frequent changes between major and minor keys underscore its lyrical content: “And voices keep calling / But nobody knows where to go,” Lynne observes, sounding just as unsure as the modulating guitars surrounding him. Throughout the verse, skillfully interwoven vocal harmonies generate sporadic swells of intensity, unexpected but never destabilizing. During the chorus, a lyrically echoing interlude about finding freedom and renewal in “a place / That I love,” the same shifting chord progressions convey the more optimistic uncertainty of life’s infinite potential. Even if “You get the feeling that / Everything’s gonna blow,” as Lynne sings in the first verse, the chorus affirms the possibility to “fly away / And start anew.” Each repetition of the lines “Let me go / Let me fly” takes on a slightly more insistent tone, rising to a conclusion somewhere between a plea and a prayer.
Whether or not anyone grants Lynne’s wishes, the next song’s title offers another solution: “Help Yourself.” Its instrumentation puts Lynne’s voice in dialogue with unhurried, wistful keyboard motifs as he reflects on a failed relationship that left him “without a clue.” Instead of recalling his past with disappointment or rancor, he advises his former lover to “never change” and “just keep on bein’ you.”
The album’s penultimate track and second single, “Time of Our Life,” commemorates ELO’s 2017 concert at London’s Wembley Stadium with the ebullient nostalgia of a cherished triumph. Lynne’s lyrics succinctly capture the best part of performing for an audience: “And best of all, they seemed so happy just being there.” Listeners are bound to feel his buoyant energy in the chorus’ jaunty beat no matter their distance from Wembley.
Lynne concludes the album on a sentimental note with “Songbird,” a slow, jazzy love song. As he sings about the long-awaited return of “her sweet voice,” layers of choral harmonies bookend an extended instrumental solo topped off with an airy keyboard glissando. The final verse might as well be describing the track’s soothing lull: “She sings her lovely song to me … Now my troubles are gone.”
ELO’s sound has few contemporary counterparts but raises the question of why classical-inflected rock is so rare. Classical music’s isolated and exclusive image stems, in no small part, from its refusal to break with centuries of custom. Lynne’s songs honor the classical tradition while making a dent in its highbrow pedestal. What might happen if more concertmasters ditched their coattails for crowd-surfing? ELO’s unparalleled success proves that fusing seemingly disparate genres can produce something exquisite and magical. You might even call it electric.

We live and work in one of the most spectacular places in North America to experience the dramatic final act of deciduous tree leaves. From Connecticut to Maine, the scarlet and brass of autumn in New England is filling Airbnbs with leaf-peeping tourists and Instagram feeds with splashes of foliar color. For many people the ephemeral boundary between summer and winter may be the only point in the year when time and attention is specifically directed toward plants.
Plants are inextricably tied to all aspects of human life. They convert carbon dioxide into the energy that fuels the global food web, provide raw materials for our buildings and clothes, created the fossil fuels that facilitated massive economic growth (but must now be replaced), and produce much of the oxygen we breathe. And yet, in our culture, there is a widespread habit of ignoring plants in the environment.
This phenomenon has been named “plant blindness,” and almost certainly contributes to dwindling resources directed toward plant education, science, and conservation. Remember, the biosphere depends on the functions performed by plants — they are the biological pillars upon which all ecosystems are built. What’s bad for plants is bad for us. However, in order to rectify plant-blindness it’s critical that we think deeper than concern for our own well-being and recognize that plants, intricate and beautiful organisms, hold intrinsic value.
The plant lineage, including photosynthetic organisms ranging from single celled algae to the tallest trees in the world, is incredibly diverse and spans roughly 1.2 billion years of evolution. From our experience teaching courses on biodiversity, we’ve noticed that most people intuitively underestimate the scale of plant diversity, while simultaneously overestimating the relative diversity of animal groups. For instance, it may surprise you to learn that there are more described species of ferns (about 12,000) than of birds (about 11,000). In total, land plants encompass roughly 300,000 species, and this diversity is mirrored by their ecological and morphological variability. Through a long, independent evolutionary history, natural selection has produced a plant body plan that is fundamentally different from our invariable and symmetrical animal bodies. Plants come in an enormous range of shapes and sizes, from tiny, unicellular alga to the most massive single organism on the planet. They can be found in all but the most extreme ecosystems. In fact, plant community composition is used to define many ecosystems. Plants are biochemically complex as well, and the source of hundreds of drugs that improve human health.
The breadth of ecological and evolutionary diversity is astounding, but learning more about plants need not be a daunting task. For many people, the first step to increasing plant awareness is learning to parse the assemblage of plants that are close at hand and matching names to species. We recommend a free app called “Seek” from iNaturalist. Taking advantage of iNaturalist’s massive image database, Seek applies a computer vision model to live images from your phone’s camera to identify species in real time. It can identify wild-growing native species as well as exotic houseplants living on the window sill.
Fortunately, bizarre and fascinating plants are not restricted to the Amazon basin, Atacama desert, or the Alaskan tundra. There are plants right here on Harvard’s campus with biology and history that may surprise you. Three such species grow outside the Harvard University Herbaria, which, along with the Arnold Arboretum, make up the home of plant science at Harvard.
Outside the front doors of the herbarium grows New England’s only native species of cactus, Eastern Prickly Pear (Opuntia humifusa), which produces massive yellow flowers and edible red fruit. A native cactus in New England may seem odd, but nearby woodlands also host native parasitic plants, carnivorous plants, and orchids.
Standing close by is the Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), representing a genus of trees that were first described from fossils and believed to be extinct until Chinese botanists discovered a small living population in the 1940s. Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum sponsored a 1947 expedition that collected the first seeds of this ‘living fossil’ for institutions outside of China.
Directly behind the herbarium stand two massive, coniferous Yew shrubs (Taxus sp.). Yew is interesting for its strange red, berry-like cone (very different from the woody cones of most conifers), as well as its important ethnobotanical history. This plant synthesizes a compound called paclitaxel that has proven to be effective in battling several cancers, and is included on the World Health Organization’s “List of Essential Medicines.” Thousands of other species growing in New England await our curiosity.
Plants were among the first organisms to colonize the terrestrial world, and they transformed a relatively barren planet into a lush set of ecosystems populated by millions of species, including ourselves. They are the glue that holds our fragile world together, and they must be noticed and protected. The curtains of orange, yellow, and red that envelop our world this season are both more important and more fascinating than many realize. Alleviating plant blindness is a critical and underappreciated step in promoting habitat restoration, biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, and cultural well-being.

Growing up in American Samoa, I was constantly surrounded by the United States military. They were at family gatherings, with many family members reminiscing about their times at boot camp or out in the field. The military was at school, with recruiters sizing students up, assessing our Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test scores, and bombarding us with all of the “opportunities” the military has to offer. And the military was just five minutes away from my house, with their base being located at the heart of our island — surrounded by our only airport, our only stadium, and our largest high school.
It’s hard not to feel obligated to join the military — hard not to feel like it’s your “duty” to serve. When it is constantly presented to you as your best option, or rather your only option, what other choice do you have? The simple answer is that you don’t — or at least it feels like we aren’t given any other alternative.
This pervasion of the military into almost every aspect of life in American Samoa dates back to even before its cession to the U.S. In fact, the primary reason why the U.S. even wanted to cede the eastern half of the Samoan Archipelago in 1900 was because of the unique shape of Pago Pago harbor and its potential military advantages. But even before this, in 1899, the U.S. had already built the United States Naval Station Tutuila in Pago Pago harbor, physically establishing their military presence on the islands. And after the cession, the United States Navy literally assumed rule over American Samoa from 1900 to 1951, with the commandant of the naval station also serving as the American Samoan governor. During World War II, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. even built several canon-like guns in the beautiful mountains surrounding the harbor in the name of safety and military strategy. So with a government historically established by the U.S. military with a purely militaristic agenda, is it really such a wonder why this pervasion exists?
But this pervasion of the U.S. military is definitely not unique to American Samoa — it is evident throughout the Pacific. The U.S. military has three major bases in Guam, with about 7,000 troops and nearly one third of its land occupied by the military. In Hawaii, there exists one of the largest concentration of U.S. military bases in the entire country, with close to 50,000 military personnel assigned there and rising each year. And in the Federated States of Micronesia, which became an independent island nation from the U.S. in 1986, there are more Army recruits per capita than any U.S. state, with recruiters visiting local high schools and signing students up by the dozen. With this pervasiveness of the U.S. military in our homes, our schools, and our daily lives, the idea that joining the military proves our worth as a people — that it is our “duty” — gets continuously reinforced into the minds of the people of the Pacific.
So to my friends, family, and members of the Pasefika community who were and are in the military, please do not take this piece as a criticism of your personal decision to enlist. I understand your valid reasons for joining — such as taking care of your families, getting out of financial struggles, or even just seeing it as one of the best options for yourself after school. And it would be naive for me not to recognize some of the opportunities and benefits that the military has provided for many people back home, my own family members included. So I applaud your decision to take action and put yourselves in better positions for providing for yourselves and/or your families, and for wanting the same for generations after you.
But at the same time, we do have to recognize that it becomes a problem when our people are widely overrepresented in the U.S. military — with an overrepresentation of 649 percent in 2005 — yet make up tiny percentages in higher education. It becomes a problem when recruitment rates for Pacific Island people into the military are higher than our college retention rates. And it becomes a problem when the narratives of our people are reduced to the stories of our military occupation rather than our unique histories and beautiful cultures.
Why are our military recruiting pathways more accessible than our pathways to higher education? Why is it easier for us to see ourselves in camouflage suits with guns than in classrooms with pen and paper? While it’s hard to see past the military because of its omnipresence in our lives, we need to understand the military is not our only option and that we belong in spaces outside of the army or the navy or the air force. We belong — and are in fact desperately needed — in higher education and other professional spaces, and those pathways need to be made more accessible to us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, United States Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.) criticized Harvard’s sanctions against single-gender social organizations during a committee hearing on the College Affordability Act. Calling the sanctions discriminatory, she spoke up in support of a proposed amendment to the legislation that would legally require “non-retaliation against students of single-sex social organizations.”
It puzzles us that the College Affordability Act was deemed an appropriate time to discuss these sanctions. The wealth harbored in final clubs and their extended networks would seem to have almost nothing in common with the topic of reduced college admissions. And using legislative mechanisms to protect that wealth would seem contradictory at best to the legislation’s broader effort to make a college education more universally accessible.
In light of that tension, we are concerned that other factors beyond the amendment’s sheer merit were behind its insertion into the proposed legislation. Given that final clubs have flexed their political muscle in seeking protection from the government before, this amendment seems to be evidence of their continued use of wealth and entrenched power to engage yet again in special-interest lobbying for the purpose of promoting their own interests.
To be sure, as we have written previously, the sanctions are not perfect — particularly in terms of the clarity of their motivations and implementation. The administration’s cited motives have shifted between sexual misconduct to gender exclusivity over the years. And though we appreciate Dean of the College Rakesh Kharana’s letter to the editor published Monday, it leaves unresolved questions we’ve had about the effectiveness of enforcement. Finally, we’ve continued to worry that the University has done a disservice to single-gender organizations offering membership to historically marginalized groups throughout this process of sanctioning. But despite this criticism, we still believe this conversation should be held in Cambridge, not Washington.
We find it almost ironic that, having lost the battle to protect clubs on campus and in the administration, final clubs have now taken their case to the U.S. House of Representatives. The fact that these predominantly wealthy so-called club “gentlemen” may well have managed to commandeer the College Affordability Act through plausible lobbying only speaks more loudly to the massive political and economic power these groups still command.
University policy cannot be dictated by the national political mite of its most wealthy former members, especially not on a scale beyond the scope of the institution itself. All colleges across the U.S. should have the ability to decide campus matters such as these for themselves without the intervention of Congress. These discussions require a deep awareness of specific campus circumstances, dynamics, and structures of power. Moreover, they require engagement from multiple groups within a campus community, not merely the ones with the resources to mount a lobbying effort.
The U.S. House of Representatives cannot be a clubhouse; final club alumni need to pack their bags and leave the capital on this matter.

Economics Professor and 2019 Nobel Laureate Michael R. Kremer ’85 shared insights into his personal journey as an economist and his experimental approach to alleviating global poverty with Harvard students during an event Tuesday afternoon at the Smith Campus Center.
Hosted by the Harvard Center for International Development, the event drew more than 200 attendees to Harvard Commons to hear Kremer speak. Kremer is a member of the CID’s Faculty Advisory Council, which oversees the University-wide research center working on development challenges and solutions to global poverty.
Kremer, along with MIT professors Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics last month for his research using experimental methods to explore the root causes of poverty in developing countries.
CID Director Asim Khwaja introduced Kremer to the audience, noting how he serves as an example of how research can be used to “make a difference in the world.”
“Michael is out there to save the world. Michael is one of the few academics I know who creates global public goods and impact,” Khwaja said.
Kremer then kicked off the discussion by sharing how he got into the field of international developmental economics, which he attributed primarily to a sense of moral duty he felt as a result of his upbringing.
“I had been interested in international development and cared about it. It’s in part because of how I was raised by my parents as a child, that we have obligations when there are injustices in the world to address them,” Kremer said.
Kremer added that concentrating in Social Studies during his undergraduate career at Harvard helped tremendously in his future work, especially the concentration’s focus on interdisciplinary inquiry.
After graduation, Kremer moved to Kenya, where he helped establish a program called WorldTeach to match Harvard students with schools in need of teachers. After completing his Ph.D. at MIT, Kremer returned to Kenya, where he observed that officials were introducing programs to schools at different rates. This inspired his experimental approach to economic research.
“Part-way through you could compare the schools that had got a particular program to those that hadn’t,” Kremer said, explaining the officials’ process. “This may seem like basic logic to you, but this was not that common at that time.”
After concluding his own story, Kremer took questions from the audience. In response to a question about how researchers come up with “groundbreaking” ideas, Kremer said to focus on pursuing passions.
“I would say choose something that you care about and that’s important,” he said. “‘Care about’ could be this puzzle that you just can’t get out of your head and you want to try to solve.”
In an interview after the event, Kremer said he was excited to host the talk and interface with Harvard students.
“There’s so many talented people in this community, so many people that genuinely care about these issues, and I wanted to be able to interact with them,” he said. “I’m grateful for, as I said, everything that I’ve learned as an undergraduate here, as a grad student here, as a faculty member.”
Audience member Jeremiah H. Kim ’23 said he appreciated the opportunity to learn more about a contemporary economic issue.
“I thought it was fantastic. It’s really interesting to see research meet reality, because often in academia those two things tend to separate, and it’s cool to see his life work reconcile those things together,” he said.

Harvard’s graduate student union announced Tuesday morning that it will strike if negotiations are unable to reach a contract with the University by Dec. 3.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile workers informed their members of the impending deadline in an email Tuesday morning. The union informed the University of its “strong mandate” to finalize a contract this semester during a bargaining session Oct. 30, according to the email.
“We on the bargaining committee, working together with department leaders from across campus, have set a strike deadline for December 3rd,” the email reads. “If the Administration does not bargain a fair agreement by that time, we will go out on strike.”
December 3 is the final day of classes for the fall semester, which means a potential strike would occur during reading and finals period.
The bargaining committee’s email highlighted that it still seeks to avoid a strike.
“The Bargaining Committee will continue to negotiate this month and will do all it can to avert a strike, but the administration must negotiate towards a fair agreement to avoid a strike,” the committee wrote.
Union negotiators declined to comment for this story.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the announcement was “disappointing.”
"HGSU-UAW is making a choice to potentially disrupt the academic work of all Harvard students as they wrap up the semester, which is disappointing,” Swain wrote. “The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith and feels a strike is unwarranted.”
“We will work across the University to prepare for a strike and make every attempt to reduce negative impact on students as they are wrapping up the semester's academic work and preparing for and taking their finals,” he added.
HGSU and the University will meet for bargaining sessions Nov. 15, 22, and 26, according to Swain.
Student teaching staff who strike will not offer instruction of any type, including teaching classes, sections, review sessions, and office hours, according to a strike guide released by HGSU. They will also stop grading papers, exams, and assignments for the duration of the strike.
Graduate research assistants who strike will also withhold 20 hours of paid research work per week, per the guide. These students, however, will not withhold the work that contributes to their own academic programs.
The bargaining committee’s email encouraged members to begin preparing for a potential strike by speaking with their students and faculty members. It also recommended members join the picket line if a strike takes place.
“In order to have strong, visible picket lines, it will be important to spend as close as possible to 20 hours on the line in lieu of working,” the email said.
At least 95 faculty members have also signed an open letter pledging that they will not retaliate against striking student workers.
Associate Provost Doreen Koretz and University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an email to faculty Oct. 15 — ahead of a vote to authorize the bargaining committee to call a strike — that it is “critical” that faculty plan for how they would continue running courses in the event of a strike.
HGSU represents roughly 5,000 graduate research assistants and student teaching staff at the University. More than 90 percent of the students who voted in a strike authorization vote last month supported strike authorization.
Tuesday’s announcement came days after the union held two town halls to update its members on the status of negotiations and make recommendations to student workers on how to navigate teaching and research responsibilities if a strike were to occur.
HGSU and the University have remained at an impasse over several key issues in the more than year-old contract negotiations, including compensation, health insurance, and a grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disability rights activist Judith E. Heumann called for private and public institutions to include the perspectives of disabled individuals in discussions about diversity and equality at the Harvard Kennedy School Tuesday.
Heumann — who has worked in multiple presidential administrations as well as at the World Bank — spoke about her formative experiences in the 1960s as a college student with disabilities, a time when there was little support for disabled individuals.
“There was no disabled students service office,” she said. “There were disabled students services offices which were beginning in colleges around the United States, but nothing where we were, nothing at Brooklyn College.”
As other marginalized groups gained civil rights and public attitudes began to change, Heumann said people with disabilities did not share in the progress.
“The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, failed to include disabled people,” she said. “The American Dream was not going to come our way because of all the acts of discrimination that were occuring.”
“And people weren’t being called [discriminatory],” she added.
After college, Heumann attempted to pursue a career in teaching, but New York City denied her a license because she used a wheelchair.
Heumann sued the city’s Board of Education and an out-of-court settlement allowed her to become the first wheelchair user to teach in the city’s schools.
Harvard Kennedy School graduate Sara Minkara, who introduced Heumann at the event, highlighted the activist’s influence on policymakers around the world.
“I’ve met with so many leaders, whether it’s ambassadors, senators, heads of state,” Minkara said. “Judy is the woman that’s impacted their lives and helped them rethink, and understand, and see the value of inclusion of people with disabilities — whether locally, nationally, or internationally.”
Despite what she sees as progress in social attitudes toward disabled individuals, Heumann argued more work remains to be done.
“I think disability is still pretty invisible,” she said. “I think there are difficult issues that need to be discussed.”
Attendee Javier Rivera, a graduate student at Boston University, said he agrees that disability is omitted from broader discussions about diversity.
“I think diversity is becoming a huge buzzword, but as Judy highlighted, disability is often left out of the conversation,” Rivera said. “We’re so focused on race, class, sex, sexual orientation — and being someone who represents a lot of those, I understand where they come from — but I think often times disability is left out.”
Minkara praised Heumann’s character, saying she has “one of the biggest hearts of anyone she has met.
“Judy is an icon, a force to be reckoned with,” Minkara said. “She empowers so many people, not just me.”
“And she supports them, and she gives them guidance in terms of how to pursue their own potential unknown value,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tara Westover, author of the New York Times bestseller “Educated: A Memoir,” discussed the value of education in today’s political climate at the Harvard Kennedy School Tuesday evening.
Westover is currently a fellow at the Shorenstein Center for Media, Politics, and Public Policy as this year’s A.M. Rostenthal Writer-in-Residence and writes, teaches student workshops, and interacts with University affiliates.
In conversation with Shorenstein Center director Nancy R. Gibbs, Westover described her experience growing up in a Mormon household, and spoke about bridging ideological and class divides in the United States through education.
“In my mind at least, education is the ultimate privilege,” Westover said. “The fact that you have access to all these different ideas, that you are able to have right-minded ideas about things, you have to decide, ‘What are you going to do then in the face of ignorance?’”
Westover said that with the rise of polarization in American politics, the goal of education is to cultivate an individual who can understand and evaluate others’ viewpoints fairly.
“Is your education going to make you arrogant? Is it going to make you persuasive?” Westover asked. “Is it going to give you the curiosity you need to understand someone in order to really talk to that person and move their mind a little bit?”
She added that people should be careful not to attack those they disagree with, but instead argue against the ideas they find to be troublesome.
“It has to be possible to attack prejudiced ideas without attacking human beings or reducing them to that one thing. That has to be possible,” Westover said.
Gibbs and Westover also talked about the state of both the Democratic and Republican party in recent years.
“I worry that we’ve lost our tolerance for ideological difference,” Westover said, referring to current political tensions.
The First-Year Experience Office assigned Westover’s book to freshmen as required reading prior to arriving on campus this fall.
After her conversation with Gibbs, Westover took questions from the crowd, some of which came from freshmen.
In response to a question about the role of religion in her life, Westover said she chose not to subscribe to another formalized religion after leaving her family, but has continued to think about how faith shapes the way she understands education.
“Religion is an interest of mine, but I’m not Mormon, and I haven’t ever replaced those beliefs with any other kind of formalized religion,” Westover said. “I think education and faith actually have a lot in common in that sense, when I think about what education is and reading stories that are not your story.”
Vishal Vasanthakumar, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said he identified with Westover’s memoir and insights during the conversation in his own academic work studying education philosophy and policy.
“A big reason, but certainly why I’m here at the education school... I’m thinking deeply about the philosophy of education and purposes," Vasanthakumar said. “It was like meeting my hero.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Antigua and Barbuda’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne demanded reparations from Harvard for the University’s historical ties to slavery in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow last month.
The letter, dated Oct. 30, recalls how Isaac Royall Jr., a plantation owner and slave trader who operated in Antigua, donated money to Harvard in 1815 to create the first endowed law professorship. The emblem became the seal of Harvard Law School in 1937.
Browne’s letter calls for Harvard to send reparations as recognition and compensation of Antiguan slaves in establishing the Law School.
“Reparation from Harvard would compensate for its development on the backs of our people,” Browne wrote. “Reparation is not aid; it is not a gift; it is compensation to correct the injustices of the past and restore equity. Harvard should be in the forefront of this effort.”
Bacow responded to Browne’s request for reparations in a letter Tuesday, noting actions taken during Faust’s presidency to acknowledge Harvard’s connections to slavery, including the installation of a memorial commemorating the enslaved individuals that contributed to Harvard Law School’s founding.
Bacow said he considers the memorial’s establishment — along with the removal of the Law School’s seal containing the Royall family crest in 2016 — to be in “significant steps” toward acknowledging Harvard’s history, but noted the need for additional work.
“We recognize that there is more work to be done,” Bacow wrote. “Indeed, Harvard is determined to take additional steps to explore this institution's historical relationship with slavery and the challenging moral questions that arise when confronting past injustices and their legacies. Harvard is also committed to working with other educational institutions to study slavery and its legacy.”
Browne’s letter comes as Harvard has increasingly been forced to reckon with its ties to slavery in recent years. In March, Tamara K. Lanier filed a lawsuit claiming that the University possessed and profited from daguerreotypes of her ancestors that are believed to be the oldest existing photographs of American slaves.
The letter also notes that Sir Ronald M. Sanders, Antigua and Barbuda’s Ambassador to the United States, has previously written two letters to Harvard — one addressed to Bacow in November 2018 and the other to former University President Drew G. Faust in October 2016. Those letters also outlined demands for reparations to be contributed to education in Antigua and Barbuda.
“Ambassador Sanders pointed out that, consequently, the reputation that Harvard enjoys internationally is intertwined with the dark legacy of Royall's Antigua slaves who died in oppression, uncompensated for their lives in slavery and their death in cruelty,” Browne wrote in his letter. “In this context, he sought a genuine effort by Harvard to make amends to the people of Antigua for the gains Harvard enjoyed at the expense of their kinfolk.
“Specifically, in his letter to you of 26 November 2018, Ambassador Sanders proposed assistance from Harvard to Antigua and Barbuda in the field of education as a form of making amends to the country,” Browne added.
Browne reiterated Sanders’ argument that education is crucial for the future development of Antigua and Barbuda and asked that reparations be directed to the University of West Indies at Five Islands. He proposed a meeting between University officials and Antigua and Barbuda government representatives to reach an agreement.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain provided The Crimson with a copy of a reply to Sanders’ 2016 letter from Faust’s former Chief of Staff Lars P.K. Madsen.
In the reply, Madsen wrote that Harvard Law School had already taken steps to address its relationship to slavery, including retiring its seal. He also noted that the University continued to commission research into its ties to slavery.
Harvard Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal referred The Crimson to the University’s comment.
Several higher education institutions including the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom and the Princeton Theological Seminary have already committed reparations to Antigua and Barbuda to compensate for their historical ties to slavery in the Carribean, according to Browne’s letter. Bacow’s response did not indicate whether Harvard planned to follow suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences debated whether Harvard should divest its $40 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry — among other possible responses to climate change — at its monthly meeting Tuesday.
Punctuated by periods of sustained applause, five faculty members invoked the existential threat of the climate crisis in calling for divestment. Their calls come as more than 380 faculty across the University have signed a petition on the issue.
Jessica Tuchman Mathews ’67 — a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — attended the meeting. University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he and Mathews would report the faculty’s views to the full Corporation, which would have the final say on divestment.
Bacow — who, like his predecessors, has steadfastly opposed calls for divestment — offered a new reason for his stance Tuesday. He warned that divestment could provoke political backlash at a time when many view the University “skeptically.”
“We need to be careful how we use our voice,” he said. “We don’t want to make it harder to solve this problem.”
Bacow also defended the fossil fuel industry in his remarks, urging faculty not to paint all companies with a “very broad brush.”
Though five professors said they support the push to divest, three others said that alternative measures would be more appropriate. All eight stressed the urgency of addressing climate change, but those against divestment largely pointed toward teaching and research as the best mechanisms for the faculty to combat climate change.
Bacow has previously said that Harvard must engage with fossil fuel companies to develop new technologies to address the crisis. But Astronomy professor Charles Conroy sought to counter that argument.
“The idea of working in collaboration with the fossil fuel industry is dangerously naïve and counterproductive,” Conroy said. “As members of the Harvard faculty, we have a powerful platform to effect change. That means we also have a responsibility to use that power in extraordinary times. And these are extraordinary times.”
Former Dean of the College and Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 argued that the faculty has limited influence over the Corporation’s investment decisions, and instead should focus on its ability to promote teaching and research.
“Someone could put a curricular motion on the table and we could vote on it,” he said. “If we wanted to make it happen, it would happen, whether the Corporation liked it or not.”
Bacow also said at the meeting that faculty members should adjust their own lifestyles to be more ecologically friendly.
Some faculty said after the meeting that Bacow went too far in calling on them to do so, in addition to their research and teaching.
"It’s a cheap accusation. Nothing would ever change if everyone were held to that,” History professor Joyce E. Chaplin said. "What are we supposed to do? Go into the faculty meeting by candlelight?"
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Chaplin’s remarks.
The faculty will resume discussion on divestment at its December meeting, Bacow said.
Earlier in Tuesday’s meeting, FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke presented a proposal to tweak existing legislation dictating the school’s new schedule. The Faculty Council — FAS’s highest governing body — voted to approve the changes earlier this month.
Burke outlined a report he had compiled assessing the impact of the College’s new schedule after approximately one year in effect, cautioning that we “need more time” to fully understand the impact of the changes, particularly after the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences moves to Allston in fall 2020.
He said departments have not adequately spread their courses across all available time slots throughout the week.
“We still see spikes in certain time slots and certain days,” Burke said.
In response to Burke’s presentation, German professor Peter J. Burgard said he disagrees with the proposed legislation because he feels it is inflexible and limits departments’ ability to offer seminar-style classes.
"What this leads to, as far as I can tell, is a collision or an infiltration of administrative interests on pedagogical principles, specifically in regard to once-a-week seminars,” Burgard said. "There are compelling pedagogical and intellectual reasons for once-a-week seminars.”
The Faculty will vote on Burke’s proposal at its December meeting.
In her introductory remarks at Tuesday’s meeting, FAS Dean Claudine Gay addressed an Oct. 24 interaction between Harvard police and students of color attempting to install a class art exhibition in Harvard Yard.
An HUPD officer questioned the students and requested to check their IDs, according to the report. After a back-and-forth between the professor, several University officials, and the officer, the students were given permission to hang the project on a construction fence in the Yard.
An FAS report released Sunday found the police did not exhibit “malicious intent” during the interaction, but dozens of faculty members sent an open letter to administrators denouncing HUPD’s response shortly after the incident. At Tuesday’s meeting, Gay called the incident “painful” and praised the faculty members’ activism.
“I was proud that members of our faculty used their voices to identify a situation that didn’t align with our academic priorities and institutional values,” Gay said.

Harvard has formed two new oversight committees in response to National Institutes of Health inquiries into potential “academic espionage” by faculty members at American universities, Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs announced at the Faculty’s monthly meeting Tuesday.
One committee is tasked with reviewing sensitive research projects, and the other is examining Faculty of Arts and Sciences policies to ensure the school complies with guidelines set forth by federal funding agencies. Stubbs said the new committees were prompted by FBI and NIH investigations into scientists across the country who are allegedly stealing biomedical research from universities and funnelling that research to foreign governments.
“Harvard has received and responded to inquiries from the NIH about inconsistencies between proposal submissions and faculty activities,” Stubbs said.
The New York Times first reported Sunday that more than 70 research institutions are investigating potential cases of intellectual property theft, after NIH sent letters to administrators at the institutions, asking them to monitor government research grants. Almost all of the incidents the NIH and FBI are investigating involve Chinese and Chinese American researchers allegedly sending materials to the Chinese government.
Stubbs said the new committees Harvard has formed in response to the federal inquiries “complement” the University’s existing administrative structures. The committees, he added, will help Harvard navigate the “rapidly changing landscape” of federal research funding.
“Academics have lost their jobs, some have been charged with crimes, and tensions are high,” he said.
One of the new committees is a University-wide body tasked with conducting “special” reviews of sensitive collaborations, according to Stubbs. Administered through the Provost’s office, the group also includes representatives from FAS, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Medical School, and the Office of the General Counsel. It monitors research efforts that might pose “elevated compliance risks.”
The other committee, which Stubbs said FAS Dean Claudine Gay established to recommend changes to FAS’s procudures specifically, will examine the administration of federal research grants.
Stubbs outlined multiple proposals the FAS committee has already recommended. In addition to requiring faculty to complete online training centered on grant compliance, the committee recommends mandating that all research proposals be submitted to Harvard’s grant administration system for a “full internal review,” at least five days before the grant’s deadline.
The FAS committee has also asked that Harvard seek out an external consultant to “fully delineate roles and responsibilities” between FAS, the central administration, academic departments, and individual faculty members. Stubbs did not clarify in his Tuesday remarks what roles and responsibilities the external consultant would oversee.
Stubbs asked faculty for their “cooperation” as the University ramps up its scrutiny and urged them to fully disclose all “external intellectual commitments and partnerships” in grant applications.
“The deliberations are grounded in a strong endorsement of the fundamental principles of freedom of scholarly inquiry, on the free exchange of people and ideas, and continuing our international partnerships,” he said. “However, we also appreciate the importance of fulfilling our responsibilities as recipients of taxpayer funding.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Preliminary vote counts show seven incumbents and two challengers were victorious in the race for Cambridge’s nine City Council seats, the Cambridge Election Commission announced late Tuesday night.
The unofficial results show that — out of a field of 22 candidates — challengers Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 and Jivan Sobrino-Wheeler secured seats on the council, ousting seven-term incumbent Craig A. Kelley. Vice Mayor Jan Devereux did not seek reelection.
Results indicate Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and councilors Alanna M. Mallon, Sumbul Siddiqui, E. Denise Simmons, Quinton Y. Zondervan, Timothy J. Toomey, and Dennis J. Carlone will likely hold their positions on the council for another two years. A new mayor will be selected by elected councilors once they take office.
Despite the rainy weather throughout the day Tuesday, initial counts put the election turnout at 20,433 votes — on par with numbers seen in previous years.
Write-in, auxiliary, provisional, and overseas absentee ballots were not included in Tuesday’s count. Elections results will be made official Nov. 15.
Nolan — a first-time candidate who has served on the Cambridge School Committee for the past 14 years — centered her campaign around governance reform, environmental sustainability, and support for neighborhood groups. Prior to the election, she received endorsements from the Massachusetts Sierra Club, the Cambridge Residents Alliance, and the Cambridge Citizens Coalition.
Nolan said she hopes the new council can work together in a “collegial, collaborative” manner, and credits her victory in part to a team of “stellar” campaign volunteers.
“I just had several people who poured their heart and soul into trying to reach as many voters as possible,” she said.
Also a first-time candidate, Sobrinho-Wheeler — who works on environmental programs at a land policy think tank in Cambridge — grounded his campaign on tenant protections and environmental sustainability.
The seven incumbents reelected were bolstered by a distinct fundraising advantage over challengers. Between Aug. 1 and Oct. 15, incumbents raised on average roughly $18,900, while challengers received average contributions of around $5,700.
This election season was a contentious one. A recent Crimson survey found that even as candidates clustered toward the liberal end of the political spectrum, they remained sharply divided on issues like affordable housing and campaign finance reform.
Affordable housing in particular has divided candidates and residents alike. A controversial 100 percent affordable housing overlay was proposed in early 2019 and subsequently saw months of fiery debate from councilors, residents, and candidates before being tabled until next term.
Six of the newly elected councilors have publicly supported the passage the housing overlay proposal and were endorsed by A Better Cambridge, an affordable housing advocacy group that hosted a candidate forum in September.
In an interview, Zondervan cited concern for the environment as a deciding factor in the election, noting that he looked forward to working with newcomers Nolan and Sobrino-Wheeler to advance an environmental agenda.
Maya E. Woods-Arthur ’23, a member of the Harvard College Democrats, said she selected Nicola A. Williams — who was ultimately unsuccessful in her bid for the council — as her first choice in part because of Williams’s endorsement from the group. She also said that her top issues included childcare accessibility, environmental policy, and the relationship between the city and Harvard.
“I’m really passionate about universal childcare, climate change policy, and also making sure that Harvard and MIT pay their fair share in taxes,” she said.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday night. O’Rourke has previously pointed to Harvard’s $4 million voluntary contribution to the city’s Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and more than $6 million contribution in taxes to Cambridge.
Harvard Graduate School of Design student Patrick C. Braga said he voted for candidates endorsed by A Better Cambridge, including Mallon, McGovern, Siddiqui, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Toomey. He said he hopes to see the affordable housing overlay passed by the next council.
“Affordable housing is one of those key urban policy issues that connects economic development, quality of life, inclusion,” he said.
Challenger Derek A. Kopon, who lost his bid, said he intends on staying involved in city government as a member of the public.
“I still plan to be involved,” Kopon said. “I think I highlighted some issues. I think I opened some people's eyes to what's going on in the city.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball crushed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 84-27 in its season opener Tuesday night, a margin of victory that tied a program record set in 1946 against Northeastern. Freshman guard Idan Tretout’s layup with four seconds left matched the 57-point record, serving as the biggest moment of intrigue in the game.
Freshman forward Chris Ledlum led the Crimson with 13 points and 11 rebounds while Christian Juzang chipped in 12 points. All but one of Harvard’s 13 active players got at least a bucket.
After kicking off the 2017 and 2018 seasons with somewhat tight victories over the Engineers, it became clear early that this year’s win over the Division III program would be more comfortable for the Crimson. MIT scored its fourth point a little over a minute and a half into the game and then didn’t put points on the board again for over 12 and a half minutes as Harvard strung together a 21-0 run to take a 25-4 lead.
It was not the Crimson’s only big run of the game. After MIT scored the opening points of the second half to cut Harvard’s lead to 33-12, the Crimson ripped off a 20-0 run, this one over a span of just six minutes as the offense started to roll. After a mistake-riddled first half in which Harvard shot just 41% from the floor and turned the ball over 14 times, the team cleaned up its offense in the second stanza, shooting 71% from the floor and outscoring the Engineers 51-17.
“I thought we were able to get to the basket a little bit more in the second half,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we wore them down. Maybe things became a little less of a challenge for us in the second half. We put a lot of pressure in them and a younger team and so I thought that [there were] breakdowns by their team, but we took advantage of it which is what we’re supposed to do.”
The Crimson held an opposing team under 40 points for the first time since it defeated MIT 59-39 in 2015. MIT, which graduated its top three scorers from last season, started just one player who averaged more than four points per game last season, and the inexperience showed on Tuesday. The Engineers turned the ball over 29 times, and while some of those giveaways were the result of good defensive plays, especially from senior forward Rob Baker who notched three steals and four emphatic blocks, many others were of the self-inflicted variety.
“I know it’s an exhibition game, but, you know, we were taking this very, very seriously,” Juzang said. “Obviously we talked a lot about how this could be a very special year so we’re kind of approaching everything in that manner, regardless of who we’re playing.”
Harvard cruised without the services of four regular members of its rotation, including star seniors Seth Towns and Bryce Aiken, who are the best bets to lead the team in scoring this season. Aiken is day-to-day, while Towns is still recovering from a knee injury suffered in the 2018 Ivy League Tournament final and his projected timetable for return is uncertain.
The blowout allowed Amaker to distribute playing time fairly evenly up and down the roster. All 13 Crimson players played between six and 24 minutes, as Amaker was able to play exclusively freshmen for the game’s final six minutes.
“I was happy that we were able to do that,” Amaker said. “I thought that they did a nice job of playing defense without fouling for the most part and being unselfish on the offensive end and doing what they’re supposed to do and not look at it as a — whatever the lead was and we should play a certain way now. A huge sign of maturity when you have players that will do that.”
Freshman forward Tim Kostolansky led the way for MIT with eight points and seven rebounds off the bench, as nobody else scored more than five points for the Engineers, who shot 1-of-14 from beyond the arc and 4-of-12 from the free throw line.
Harvard will return to action Friday night when it faces Northeastern in what should be a much more competitive game.
The Huskies defeated the Crimson 81-71 last season and are coming off a season-opening victory at Boston University. Northeastern’s star senior guard Jordan Roland, who came off the bench to score 35 points against Harvard last season, put up 39 against the Terriers on Tuesday night and will look to continue his dominant play against the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down in the Bronx competing for the Ivy League title, both the Men’s and Women’s Cross Country Teams captured second place in the cold fall climate, securing four all-league selections in the process. Both programs had strong races but had different expectations coming into the meet.
For the men, the story thus far has been one of success without a fully healthy squad. Last week at the Nuttycombe Invitational in Madison, two scorers for the Crimson, first-year Colin Baker and Junior Will Battershill made their first appearances of the season. This race, junior Hugo Milner, last year’s third-place finisher at the Ivy League Championship, made his debut for the season. This type of instability in the lineup has characterized this season and made preparation difficult. While this team has talent, many of their best runners have little to no race experience this season. Nonetheless, the men’s squad came into the title contest with high expectations. Finally healthy and working with a full lineup, the Crimson men were going for the title.
In a hotly contested 8k race, the Harvard men placed second, falling just short of the upstart Penn squad and just edging last year’s champion Princeton. The spread between the top three teams was a slim six points, as the Tigers finished with 62 points, the Quakers finished with 68 points, and the Crimson runners finished in the middle with 65 points. With just a couple of shifts in positioning, this race could have gone either way. This finish matched their team performance from last year where they also finished second, the best finish for the team since 1984.
“Our goal was to go for the team win, so we were disappointed that we fell short of that, especially by such a small margin,'' commented senior captain Charlie Davis on the team’s expectations and performance. “That being said, I’m really proud of how we raced as a team. Our guys fought hard for every spot in that race.”
Pacing the Harvard men was rookie Colin Baker who had his best race of his short career, crossing the line in eighth with a time of 24:52.8, good for a sub-five minute pace. The South Charleston native in only his second race wearing the crimson uniform, broke the first-year record performance in the Ivy League Championship previously set by Milner in 2017 when he placed 11th.
For a team that often has been boosted by its strong freshman class, the rest of the scorers for the Crimson were all veteran upperclassmen. Last year’s champion senior Kieran Tuntivate placed 11th in the event, followed immediately by junior Mathew Pereria in 12th. While Kieran had high hopes for a repeat of last year’s performance in this event, he will have plenty of opportunities to run as well as he did last year, culminating in his famed one shoe win in the spring. Pereria has quietly held down the middle scoring position for Havard and has stabilized an otherwise volatile top five that has struggled to get healthy the whole season. The trio of Baker, Tuntivate, and Pereria were All-Ivy second team selections, and will look to build on their performance at NCAA Regionals in two weeks.
To round out the top five, Milner crossed the line in 16th and Battershill crossed the line in 18th, thirteen and six spots below their respective performances from last year. This pair of 2018 All-Ivy League performers has simply not had much race time this year, and will look to get even stronger as Harvard moves deeper into its championship season.
While the men certainly came into the race with the hopes of winning, they fell just short. However, their season is not over. With two weeks of training ahead, the Crimson has opportunities to improve before regionals.
“I’m excited for the regional meet next weekend. Over the next two weeks, we will focus on smaller details and things to improve upon from HEPs,” senior captain Davis said, “I’m very confident in our fitness, and I know we’ll be physically fresher and an even stronger team mentally when we race in Buffalo and are eyeing an NCAA championship spot.”
The women came into the race with much different expectations. After placing near the bottom of the pack in sixth last year at the Ivy League Championships, the team was ready to put a different mark on this year’s race.
The clear favorite No. 24 Colombia team took first with 54 points. However, the next spots were up for grabs. Havard ended up picking up second place in the Ivy League Championship with 89 points, Penn finished in third with 89 points as well, and Princeton finished in fourth with 90 points. This tight race meant that second place was decided by the tiebreaker performance of the Crimson women’s sixth runner.
“We were really pleased with the team performance at HEPs. We knew going in that if everyone had a good day, we had the chance to surprise the league, and that’s what ended up happening,” commented senior co-captain Gillian Meeks on the result. “It was inspiring to see team members who had had a rocky build-up this season put everything on the line for the team performance and pull off great races.”
The Harvard women were led by junior Anna Juul who finished the 6k course with a blistering time of 20:53.8 good for third in the meet. The top finisher in every race for the Crimson women this year captured valuable points for the team that allowed their pack to bring the second place home. For her efforts, Juul was named to the All-Ivy first team, the only member of either the Harvard men or women to garner such an honor this year.
The next pack of four women won the day for the Crimson. Junior Judy Pendergast, first-year Iz Sagar, Meeks, and junior Brooke Starn finished 20th, 21th, 22nd, and 23rd respectively. This cohesive pack finished within three seconds of each other. Simply judging by how close the scores were, if one of these runners were displaced from the pack, the Harvard women easily could have ended up in fourth.
However, the true key to the day came down to the sixth runner. In cross country, if a head to head score between two teams is tied, the winner is decided by whose sixth runner placed higher. In the case of the Crimson women, after their five scoring runners, they were tied 89 to 89 with Quakers. On a day where the Harvard women put so much on the line, everything fell in the right direction as sophomore Maya Rayle placed 37th in the race, beating out Penn’s sixth runner who placed 46th. Of note, Princeton’s sixth runner placed 31st, and would have beaten Harvard on the same tiebreaker if they had one more point from their top five scorers.
“It was also crazy that it came down to a tie-break to decide 2nd place team from 3rd place team, I’ve never had that happen to my team before. The fact that we won the tiebreak handily just shows how great of team performance it was,” commented Meeks on the team victory in tiebreak. “It was also super cool to have such a tight pack of our 2 to 5 runners all finishing right with each other and have an amazing individual 3rd place finish by Anna Juul.”
Overall, the performance for the Harvard women was about fight and determination. This finish gives them a huge boost going into regionals as they take on some of the best runners in the country.
“We are excited and optimistic heading into NCAA regionals,” said Meeks. “Even though we had a great team performance at Heps we still think that we have even more room for improvement and are aiming to finish top 2 in the region and gain a birth the national championships.”
Both teams have two weeks off before heading into regionals, which take place in Buffalo, N.Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“At first, I hated it,” said Meiyi Yan, a first-year on the Harvard women’s golf team. “But looking back on it now, I wouldn’t be where I am today without golf.”
Yan, who spent her early childhood in Beijing, did not follow a typical path to playing golf at the collegiate level. While in China, she barely even touched a single golf club.
Yan began her athletic career as a figure skater, competing for five years in China. Her brother was an ice hockey player — and without a strong team sports culture in Beijing — she decided to try out figure skating.
Yan would train four to five times every week while living in Beijing, making a 45-minute commute to practice each way. She remarked that she is thankful that her parents sacrificed so much for such a high stakes activity.
But around the age of 11, Yan and her family decided to move to Connecticut. The relocation to the other side of the globe prompted her to experiment with some new athletic interests, and so she tried out her brother’s longtime sport.
“With the new environment, my parents wanted me to make new friends, so they suggested that I try ice hockey,” she said.
Yan went on to play ice hockey competitively for a year and a half, suiting up for her local team in Connecticut. It was also there that she first started to pick up golf, as she would occasionally go to the driving range with her father.
Still, Yan was all-in on playing ice hockey. But after an encounter with a new community down south, Yan’s athletic endeavors flipped completely.
“It was kind of funny, actually, my family went on this cruise to Florida, and we had this family friend in the Orlando area,” Yan said. “We saw the community they were in, which was very golf-heavy, and my parents were like ‘Wow, we really love the environment that Florida has to offer.’”
The warm and bustling golf community of Florida certainly made a remarkable impression on Yan’s parents. With little to go off of besides this visit, Yan’s parents decided to move yet again, this time to a small town right outside Orlando called Windermere. Her parents had already recognized that she had immense athletic talent and potential, and while they had not given her much of a chance to showcase her talent in golf or even see if she liked the sport, they decided that a transition to the new community and sport was best for her.
Yan was not a fan of leaving Connecticut, nor was she a fan of switching sports again. At first, she noted, the switch felt like it was forced onto her. But as she trudged her way through the first few months of frustration, she began to feel more connected to the community and to the sport. Because golf is so huge in Florida, there were many kids around her age competing in tournaments, so she was able to meet a large number of peer golfers very quickly.
Around the age of 12, Yan began competing in tournaments all across Florida. She faced off against many great golfers from the state in addition to golfers from all over the country. Yan noted that the mindsets needed going into golf competitions varied greatly from any figure skating competition.
“For figure skating, you train the entire year and you have at most two competitions a year. And that’s it,” Yan said. “You have a couple of minutes to show people what you trained for. And if you mess up, you mess up. It’s a make or break.”
With golf in Florida, competitions were much more frequent. Taking advantage of the massive junior golf community in Florida, Yan had the opportunity to compete in over 20 tournaments every year. Almost every other weekend of hers was spent on the courses, working on her game.
“You learn so much in competition,” the first-year said. “It’s a learning process and it gives you feedback on what you need to work on and how you can improve in different areas. I had to realize this about every tournament. I had to come to terms with the fact that playing badly is inevitable, but playing badly in one round does not determine who you are or what your skills are.”
Golf, like figure skating, requires an immense amount of focus and precision. Knowing that it is okay to make mistakes and that every swing of the golf club is not the be-all and end-all was initially a tough realization for Yan, but she gradually learned to adopt a growth mindset.The big difference between the two sports, however, is the sheer number of opportunities one gets in golf versus in figure skating.
Although figure skating and golf do seem like polar opposites, there are a few striking similarities, Yan pointed out.
“There are a lot of artistic aspects, and while I was training and competing, I also had to do ballet. Flexibility was also super important,” Yan said about figure skating. “ [The flexibility] helped me in golf because of all of the rotation involved in the swing and follow-through.”
Both sports are elegant in their own ways, and though golf is not quite as physically demanding in the immediate sense as figure skating, it is equally challenging in golf to improve and maintain a winning mentality.
In regards to the individuality of each sport, Yan noted that competing in both sports yielded some sense of loneliness, but the golf culture felt different.
“Being in America, having that really supportive environment made golf feel less like an individual sport and more like a team sport,” said Yan.
It was in high school that Yan started to fully realize how important it was to have a supportive community. At higher levels of competition, it can often get even lonelier, so having close friends on the team was vital for Yan’s success. In high school competitions, individual scores are combined to come up with a final team result, helping her to develop camaraderie with her teammates and to buy into the community.
Now at Harvard, Yan’s experience with golf has been slightly different. In high school, she would only compete with other members of her team, and she would practice independently. On the Crimson team, she not only competes but also practices with the team.
“The first few weeks were a bit of a struggle because back home I was used to practicing by myself and being in charge of my own time,” said Yan.
But, she quickly adjusted to her new way of life in Cambridge, learning how to manage her time more wisely, both in the classroom and during practice. And now that the fall season is behind her, she feels even more connected to the team.
After a successful inaugural season of collegiate golf playing in tournaments at Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale, and Delaware, Yan said that the training is starting to slow down, but it will pick back up in February for the start of the spring season.
With the spring season comes the Ivy League Championship in addition to an abundance of other tournaments scattered throughout the coming months. Yan hopes to continue her growth as an athlete and as a person by watching the upperclassmen and learning from their experiences.
But for now, Yan seeks to take in everything Harvard has to offer, from spending time with peers at the university to trying her hand at a few other activities, like volunteering or Model United Nations.
Yan has constantly been inspired by others around her, from her time on the ice to her continuing experience playing golf at elite levels. And for someone who has come to embrace and make the most of the unexpected, it is hard to imagine a world where she does not continue to make a name for herself.

While we all wish we were as exciting as emails announcing lottery winners for College Events Board events or acceptances from professors to join their research projects, like it or not, most of us are doomed to the sad fate of being a mildly irritating and predictable spam email. But are you the relentless Harvard Shop email announcing yet another discount or the house email thread that has gone entirely off the tracks? Take this quiz to find out!
1. On a Saturday night you can be found…
A. Doing the same thing you do in lecture: online shopping. You need more Harvard gear! Last week, someone asked you what school you went to and you simply can’t be bothered with such absurd questions.
B. Shooting your shot — at the gym of course. You need a few pointers (maybe a three-pointer) on how to shoot your shot romantically.
C. Fast asleep on your big, comfy, roomy bed!
D. On your way to Brain Break only to realize that it’s Saturday, and deprived of your nightly sustenance, you return to your room to rant about this act of injustice via an email blast.
2. What is your go-to method for blowing off some steam?
A. Blowing off your friends to steam the new clothes you just bought because while friends will try to get you to cool down, your clothes will appreciate the heat you’re sharing with them.
B. Sitting in a steamy sauna post-gym. Why get worked up when you can work out?
C. St(r)eaming Netflix while making popcorn using your handy microfridge, of course!
D. You can’t steam (read: seem) to find your roommates, and besides, why deprive your house from hearing the great tales of your woes when you have a talent for storytelling?
3. What would be your worst dhall nightmare?
A. Spilling something on your Harvard sweater. That would be horrific, horrendous, and horrifying.
B. The dhall running out of Powerade. You can power through any other misfortune, but the loss of this beverage is enough to send you into a beve-rage
C. Losing your water bottle. Wat-er you supposed to pour water into now?
D. Zero drama in the dhall. Isn’t the point of going to the dhall making sure that you can go back to your room without feeling bored?
4. What is your modus operandi when it comes to scoring a date?
A. You take them out on spontaneous adventures to show them that there is nothing worse than staying Coop-ed up.

D. You let them know how much they mean to you by sending them the modern love letter: an email that brings tears to your house dean’s eyes.
Results:
Mostly A’s: You are the relentless Harvard Shop emails. You provide us with a means to retail-iate against our bank accounts.
Mostly B’s: You are the tenacious Harvard Athletics emails. You keep track of all the major sports games, but greatly overestimate our willingness to traipse across the bridge to cheer on our classmates.
Mostly C’s: You are the clingy Cleaners and Dorm Essentials emails. You help us keep our emails clean by making us rapidly delete spam emails and only keep the essentials.
Mostly D’s: You are the random and often too personal house emails. We know you have a blast sending out email blasts, but if you need tape, please just go ask a friend instead of spamming us all.
