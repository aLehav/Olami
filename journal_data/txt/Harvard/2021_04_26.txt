After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Belgian artist René Magritte, famous for his surrealist artwork, once said: “Art evokes the mystery without which the world would not exist.”
If Magritte were alive to talk to me, he would tell me he is neither a painter nor a surrealist but rather a thinker. His artwork is known for the mind-bending puzzles it creates and the illusions it presents to the eye. Put simply, one is forced to think a little harder when viewing his art.
But this particular brand of thinking is dying. Visual art, like many of the humanities, is a shrinking field. Without art, we will be left with a fundamentally less creative society, one that is empty of a quintessential human experience.
During my first semester at Harvard, I was overwhelmed by other students’ scrambling to gain acceptance into different consulting clubs, the most challenging finance internships, or the highest-level math and computer science courses. I felt like I was doing something wrong. Instead of spending my spare time working on a presentation for the Harvard College Consulting Group or preparing for an interview, I was drawing in my sketchbook or assembling a collage out of magazines bought from CVS. I was stressed about coursework as much as my friends, but by the end of the semester, I felt embarrassed I’d spent so much time pursuing something I wasn’t sure was worthy of my time.
But visual art is worthy of our time. It is necessary for the fostering of creative minds. Science, law, finance — these fields all rely on creativity for their existence and advancement. A creative mind cannot be bottled, programmed, or copied, though it can certainly be suppressed and ignored. Over the past several decades, the study of art has been on the decline, replaced by the ever-growing fervor among young people for business, medicine, and engineering; computer science, too, is gaining popularity.
As our society leaves behind a great century of art, from café culture in Paris in the 1920s to dreamlike surrealism to colorful pop art, we approach a bleaker, more obsolete future without it — one in which the mystery that fuels the world, as Magritte told us, would not exist.
In a 1948 interview with Harper’s Magazine, Magritte asked his interviewer, “Don’t you think it is the painters, poets, and writers who freed themselves from formulas, who created new ways of thinking?” To this question, his interviewer responded, “of course,” and the conversation moved on. I think this question, however, points to a disturbing truth about a growing trend in society: Art, as a field of study, is fading, and with it, our ability to think anew is disappearing, too.
Any field relying on innovation relies on creativity, and visualization is a fundamental aspect of creating. This reliance becomes clearer through the historical relationship between science and art: Take Leonardo da Vinci, an incredible polymath and artist, or Maria Sibylla Merian, a botanical illustrator who analyzed insect metamorphosis and breeding in her depictions. Today, however, there are fewer and fewer Renaissance minds, even though art challenges our brains to develop new forms of communication and enables imagination, ultimately leading to a greater ability for future planning. Girija Kaimal, professor in creative arts therapies at Drexel University, proposed the evolutionary benefits — and ultimately, the purpose — of art as being foundational in the brain’s predictive abilities.
Visual art is an evolving part of human existence, from cave art to Magritte’s surrealist puzzles. We cannot continue passing it off as a field simply isolated from other areas of study or an unnecessary elective.
Harvard art historian Susan Dackerman noted sixteenth-century artist Albrecht Dürer’s influence on astronomy as “profound” in her lecture on how Renaissance artists critically shaped the scientific inquiries of their time. Of course, scientific advancement now is different from how it was in the sixteenth century, just as how we value creativity and art has also drastically changed. We are increasingly dividing “creative” fields from technical fields, when in reality these skills must be further blended rather than made distinct.
I am not suggesting everyone become visual arts majors. I am simply suggesting art should be further integrated into other fields.
The interdisciplinary era of Renaissance minds is out of fashion, and visual art is one of the first fields to fade as society embraces specialization over breadth. We have to recognize visual art for the benefits it offers our minds, particularly if our brains are accustomed to finishing problem sets all day or lab work all night. Art requires science, and science requires art.
Drawing in my sketchbook is not less valuable than preparing for an interview — both are important, but, unfortunately, only one is considered necessary.
Great artistic minds like Magritte’s do much more than just paint.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday, our third and hopefully final semester of endless Zoom classes will slowly become a memory.
Although much has changed since Covid-19 took over our world, even more has stayed the same. Absent from headlines, applications, bills, and deadlines still come due and our meritocratic machine churns forever on. And current Harvard seniors are now faced with the task of transitioning out of their undergraduate years into a job market and graduate school landscape marred by change and uncertainty.
Whether it’s getting a high school diploma, graduating college, or moving out of our parent’s house, so much of being a young person is working our way to the next big milestone. As our lives continue to be defined by deadline after deadline, work life and home life merge, and the things that make us humans become anathema to our productivity as students and workers.
In searching for the human perspective amidst these standardized way-posts, I spoke with a high school senior who will be entering Harvard College’s Class of 2025 this fall, and a current Harvard senior on the cusp of graduation to make sense of what comes next for students grappling with the global challenges of pandemic life while reaching the same milestones that generations of Harvard students before them have undergone.
Falina A. Ongus ’25, a high school senior from New York, NY who committed to the Harvard Class of 2025 this past week, spoke to me about her journey from Zoom classes to Harvard. As a first-generation college student, she was already at a disadvantage when navigating America’s complicated network of universities; plus, like many current high school seniors, she was unable to tour the colleges to which she eventually applied.
In her mind, the personal qualities that “really make a school,” like connections with current students, weren’t accessible to her because of the barriers imposed on all of us by pandemic circumstances. She described her college application process as essentially flying blind.
While Ongus is happy with how her college journey ended up, she’s “not sure how to feel” about starting Harvard in the fall because, despite the administration's expectation of in-person learning, so much of the College’s and the country’s future is shrouded in uncertainty.
Yet, other seniors, including some of Ongus’s friends, who didn’t get the admissions results they wanted, are confronted with uncertainty of their own. As Harvard and hundreds of other colleges announced record-low acceptance rates that would have been unthinkable a generation ago, unprecedented numbers of applicants are left down on their luck, asking themselves why they ended up in the most competitive applicant pool in history.
Ongus, who goes to a high school with one of the highest average SAT scores in America, knows more than a few students in her graduating class who were upset by Harvard’s decision to make standardized testing optional this year. The bane of some people’s application was the expected highlight of others.
According to Ongus, who is the co-president of her senior class, the emotional drain of the application process has, at least in some ways, been lessened by the absence of in-person high school. The college apparel days that were once sacred at her school (my alma mater) are made impossible by remote instruction and the ill-will and gossiping that often accompany college decisions aren’t as present in her eyes. For Ongus, the visible features of committing to a college have been reduced to “updating a Facebook profile.”
Cassandra Luca ’21, a Crimson Arts editor and current senior set to graduate next month, has embraced the bittersweet nature of graduating college during a pandemic. Like Ongus, Luca began her online educational experience halfway into her junior year. Currently living in an off-campus apartment, Luca has not lived in Quincy, her house, since Harvard went online last year. Taking online classes and applying to graduate school programs, the English concentrator felt disconnected from the institution during the year that was supposed to be the peak of her induction into Harvard traditions.
But despite the “weird half-setting” that online school brought about, Luca still feels that she has gotten the most she was able to from Harvard during her time here. Next fall she’ll be moving to Canada for her graduate degree program in English at McGill University. Like the uncertainty surrounding Harvard’s in-person future, Luca is prepared for the reality that the situation surrounding the pandemic could change at any time, and muddle the plans that the Canadian university has announced for the fall.
Throughout my column, I’ve set out to tell the story of meritocracy from the unique vantage point of Harvard students. I wanted to find out what it means to be successful in an economic reality that revolves around perpetual competition in a school that is the epitome of competitive. But, more importantly, I wanted to see to what extent the individuality of each student and the sum of their experiences conform to this ecosystem of endurance.
What the stories of Luca, Ongus, and the many others I’ve interviewed reveal is that so much of meritocracy revolves around the completion of life-defining milestones. Whether it be graduating high school, college, or working our first jobs, these milestones supposedly tell us what contributions we are capable of making to society at large.
Even though so much has gone undone during this past year, these milestones occur undeterred in the midst of too many emotional twists and turns, endured unsupported. And while individuals are constantly evaluated on the basis of their purported societal contributions, our society’s standardization of success has suffocated too many into feeling as though they can’t measure up when it’s actually the other way around.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Civic and education leaders from around the world discussed the future of education in technology in a Harvard Graduate School of Education webinar Friday.
The event, the most recent installment in HGSE’s webinar series Education Now, was moderated by Thomas J. Kane, a professor of education and economics at HGSE, and featured Anant Agarwal, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and founder of Harvard and MIT’s online education platform edX; Usha Goswami, a professor of cognitive developmental neuroscience and director of the Center for Neuroscience in Education at the University of Cambridge; and Angeline Murimirwa, the executive director for Africa of the Campaign for Female Education.
Kane and the three panelists are members of the Council of Luminaries, a group of top education researchers formed last year by the Yidan Prize Foundation, which co-sponsored Friday’s event.
Agarwal said the most crucial step countries must take now to better education is to invest in technological infrastructure.
“Many of the worldwide agencies and governments should be investing in infrastructure, particularly the internet,” Agarwal said. “The reason is that content is becoming widely available.”
“Those that have access to the internet can get broad access to content and can rapidly improve their lives and careers,” he added.
Thinking ahead to the effects of Covid-19 on education globally, Agarwal said a “new normal” for learning will emerge as a result.
“Both technology-enabled learning and in-person learning will coexist in classrooms all over the world,” Agarwal said.
With the acknowledgement that education’s future will change, Murimirwa spoke to inaccessibility concerns, noting that technology currently only serves those in education who are able to purchase it. Similarly, Agarwal noted that a lack of proper training hinders the use of technology in education.
“If you just provide technology, it’s a pile of junk, unless you train the teachers and provide the content,” he said.
Goswami explained, however, that technology is not a one-size-fits-all solution to enhancing education globally, especially for younger children. Instead, she said countries should rethink their priorities and determine what students and educators need to thrive.
“I really don’t think technology is the answer for younger children,” Goswami said. “The answer is empowering the teachers and giving them a better way of interacting with children.”
Goswami noted that Covid-19 revealed inequities not only in the context of Murimirwa’s work in Africa, but everywhere in the world.
“It isn’t only in Africa where some children have been much more disadvantaged by Covid,” she said. “It’s also in first world countries.”
Murimirwa said Covid-19 presents an opportunity to rebuild a better education system for the future, reflecting on what educators and researchers have learned over the past year.
“Covid has been brutal, but now we have a time to build, and an opportunity to build forward,” Murimirwa said.

Harvard has agreed pay its graduate student union $60,000 as a settlement for dues it failed to deduct from union members’ paychecks from July to September 2020, according to a joint statement released by the University and the union earlier this month.
Under Article 31 of its contract ratified last June, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers members are not required to pay membership dues, but members can authorize the University to deduct dues directly from their paychecks and remit them to the union. HGSU-UAW filed a Step 1 grievance against the University on Sept. 9, 2020 after union members noticed that dues were not deducted from their paychecks as requested.
“We want Harvard to pay us back,” the union wrote in an email to membership on Sept. 18, 2020.
Harvard rejected the Step 1 grievance a few days later. HGSU-UAW then filed a Step 2 grievance on Oct. 2, 2020, which the University again denied on Oct. 29. Both parties then prepared to proceed to the next step in the grievance process, third-party arbitration.
The grievance was scheduled for a third-party arbitration hearing on April 22, but the two sides reached a settlement April 13.
In the joint statement following the settlement, the union and University wrote that they “reached an agreement fully resolving” the grievance.
“Pursuant to this agreement, the University will issue HGSU a payment for voluntary dues that it was unable to deduct from student workers’ paychecks and remit to HGSU for the months of July, August and September 2020,” the statement reads. “The University also waives any right it had or has to recoup dues from student workers for this same time period. HGSU will withdraw its grievance and demand for arbitration regarding both dues and V-CAP payments.”
V-CAP is the United Automobile Workers union’s political action fund.
The statement explained that the University made “good faith efforts,” but was “unable to” deduct dues until mid-September 2020 for several reasons: complications from the Covid-19 pandemic; the new payroll system and job titles for student workers under the contract; and the lack of time between the contract’s ratification date, June 30, and its implementation date, July 1.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla declined to comment beyond the joint statement.
HGSU-UAW’s Executive Board sent a union-wide email April 19 announcing the settlement.
“This is a huge indication that our grievance process, which can culminate in neutral, third-party arbitration, helps us solve workplace issues,” the board wrote. The union is currently pursuing at least two other grievances with the University, one over the definition of its bargaining unit, and another over payroll issues faced by student workers living abroad.
Union members celebrated the settlement and HGSU-UAW’s enforcement of its contract.
“I’m obviously very happy that the settlement was reached,” said Jonathan J. Booth, a longtime rank-and-file member of HGSU-UAW. “I think that our position was clearly vindicated by the settlement.”
Erik Baker, another HGSU-UAW member, agreed.
“I was really glad to see our union take a proactive stand in saying, ‘It’s in the contract; we’re going to enforce it,’” he said.
Baker also said he believes the settlement demonstrates the importance of a contract and he is “excited to keep fighting” for a second contract to secure worker protections.
“It was a sign of the power that we built up,” he said. “This is exactly why I voted to ratify the contract in the first place — so that we would have this structure to actually enforce our rights.”

John F. Kerry, former Secretary of State and current Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, joined intelligence experts and other stakeholders at a Harvard Kennedy School conference on the geopolitical, intelligence, and national security implications of climate change on Friday.
The half-day conference was co-sponsored by the HKS Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs’s Environment and Natural Resources Program, the Belfer Center’s Intelligence Project, and the nonpartisan think tank Center for Climate Change and Security.
The conference — titled “Climate Change, Intelligence, and Global Security” — was held just after Earth Day and a White House climate summit with 40 world leaders. Along with keynote speaker Kerry, the HKS conference hosted intelligence officers, climate experts, military personnel, and private sector stakeholders, such as the McKinsey Global Institute, to address climate change.
During the keynote speaker event, Kerry stressed the importance of looking at climate change as a national security threat.
According to Kerry, the climate crisis could lead to massive geopolitical and humanitarian disasters.
“We know that the climate crisis has the ability to be able to produce countless refugees, huge instability, food interruptions, food production interruptions — it becomes a cauldron for extremist organized organizing and proselytizing,” Kerry said. “It could even become an instrument in mass migrations or geostrategic manipulation of populations to go to war or do any number of things.”
During the event, Kerry noted the historic lack of attention paid to the climate crisis by the U.S. intelligence community, which traditionally focuses on espionage as well as domestic and international terror threats.
“I look at the intel — and this is the national annual threat assessment of the U.S. intelligence community here — and I go to ‘Climate Change and Environmental Degradation,’ and there’s literally six paragraphs,” Kerry said.
James Calder Walton, the assistant director of the Belfer Center’s Applied History and Intelligence Project, said the “national security” label underscores the threat climate change poses to the international community in the coming years.
Given the political tensions in the U.S. surrounding climate change, Walton said he is “optimistic” that framing climate change as an issue of national security might remove some of the “political baggage” surrounding the subject.
Kerry said he expects the intelligence community to handle the climate crisis like other existential threats to U.S. interests in the future.
“One, I want to know, the judgments being made — on which we’re being asked to make decisions and to respond — how legitimate are they?” Kerry said. “The second thing I want to know is — if it is indeed the threat it is and we have to respond the way we say we’re having to respond — I want the intel community to tell me as much as I know about my negotiations, as much as I can learn about what each country is in fact thinking, planning, willing to do.”

Music artists Aminé and Trevor Daniel starred in Harvard’s first-ever virtual Yardfest on Friday, the latest College tradition shifted online due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“Make some motherfucking noise for yourselves,” Aminé told a virtual audience of Harvard undergraduates during the latest iteration of the College’s annual spring music festival.
Friday’s concert, live-streamed on Vimeo, marked the first Yardfest since 2019. Last year, Harvard canceled the event — which is hosted annually by the College Events Board and usually takes place in Harvard Yard — due to Covid-19.
Past Yardfest headliners have included singer Bazzi, rappers Lil Yachty and Wale, and DJ Tiësto.
Rapper Aminé, the concert’s headliner, performed several of his songs — including “Riri,” “Shimmy,” and “Woodlawn” — from an undisclosed studio.
In between songs, Aminé narrated what his concerts would look like before the coronavirus pandemic shut down large events indefinitely.
“This is the part of the show where I tell you guys, ‘You’re beautiful,’ and then you say, ‘I know,’” he said. “There’s hella adrenaline in the room — I might even jump in the crowd, say what’s up to you, FaceTime your mom, something like that.”
“But right now we can’t, so I hope you’re doing well in your dorm room or your apartment,” he told students watching.
Daniel, a singer and songwriter, performed songs backed by a drummer and guitarist including “Past Life” and “Falling” — which peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2020 — from his debut album “Nicotine.”
“We’re here to rock out,” Daniel said as his set began. “We’re your professors today.”
The virtual concert opened with recorded performances from two student acts, the Yard Bops and King Sayg, who won the “Battle for Yardfest” competition last month.
Yard Bops, a group of student musicians, kicked off the show with a mashup of Bruno Mars songs “Locked Out of Heaven,” “Runaway Baby,” and “Treasure.” Rapper King Sayg — Mario O. “Rio” Haskett Jr. ’21 — took the virtual stage next to perform his set.
Manny A. Yepes ’24, a Crimson Blog editor, said the student performances were his favorite part of the event.
Logan C. Kelly ’24 wrote in a message that though Yardfest was a “fun distraction,” the online format was less engaging than an in-person show. He added that many of his friends were unaware Yardfest was even taking place this year.
“It was great to see Harvard students having fun and jamming out on screen, and it was cool to have Aminé perform for us, but we spent more time talking about the concert than watching,” Kelly wrote.
Nicholas E. Kelly ’23, director for the College Events Board’s arts and entertainment committee, wrote in an email that the organization began planning for this year’s Yardfest a year ago.
“We started planning Yardfest back around April of 2020, and have been using the past year to diligently work on the show,” he wrote. “It seems that the show was received well across the student body.”
Under the circumstances, Yepes said he enjoyed the virtual event.
“It was the best they could have done with what they had,” he said. “I was alone at the time because I’m home right now, but if I was with friends, it definitely would have been more fun.”
CORRECTION: May 6, 2021
A previous version of this article misspelled the stage name of Mario O. “Rio” Haskett Jr. ’21. It is King Sayg, not Sage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders has spiked since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, two Harvard affiliates said they experienced verbal and physical attacks in Cambridge earlier this spring.
A March report by the nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate identified nearly 3,800 hate incidents against Asian Americans in the past year, 96 of which took place in Massachusetts.
Mary Heather C. “Kiwi” Florido, a Ph.D. candidate in the Biological Sciences in Public Health program who identifies as Filipino-American, said she was walking toward Harvard’s Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building, located at 7 Divinity Ave., on March 25 when she witnessed a man yell racial slurs.
To avoid a maskless man walking toward her, Florido said she crossed Kirkland Street, just ahead of another Asian person walking down the street. Per Florido, the maskless man then followed her across the street and began to yell racial slurs at the Asian man walking behind her.
Incoming traffic caused the man to turn back to the other side of the road, according to Florido, who reported that she and the Asian man were not physically harmed.
Despite reports of anti-Asian violence across the country, Florido said she was shocked that the incident occurred in Cambridge adjacent to Harvard.
“It just hit me that, ‘Oh right, we’re suffering from all the anti-Asian hate,’ but it sort of took time to process that this is happening in the streets of Cambridge, literally right next to campus, which is very — I don’t know, it was unexpected,” Florido said.
Pedestrians stopped to watch the incident but did not intervene, per Florido, who said it was “crazy to see the bystander effect in person.”
Less than a month after that incident, an Asian American Harvard College student said he was returning a Bluebike in Porter Square on April 10 when a white man physically assaulted him.
The student, whom The Crimson granted anonymity due to privacy concerns, said in an interview that the aggressor shouted in his direction asking if he wanted to fight. The man then approached the student and hit him, grazing his shoulder. The student ran away from the man, who briefly chased after him.
The student also said that no bystanders intervened.
Though he said he felt lucky he did not sustain serious injuries, he said the incident was traumatizing.
One week after the incident took place, he reported it to the Harvard University Police Department. He said he did not report the incident immediately because he doubted any action would come of it.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that the department is committed to supporting affiliates who are victims of bias-related crimes.
“Any acts or threats of violence, property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes designed to infringe upon a person’s civil rights will be treated seriously and given the highest priority,” Catalano wrote.
Beyond Harvard affiliates, other Cambridge residents have also reported being the victims of racially-motivated hate crimes and violence.
According to a report on hate crimes in Cambridge published by the Cambridge Police Department, there were 15 hate crimes reported in Cambridge in 2020, 10 of which were racially-motivated. In 2019, CPD took 18 reports of hate crimes, nine of which were caused by racial bias.
On April 9, Cambridge resident Calla M. Walsh tweeted that she and her friend, who is Asian, were in Harvard Square when they were called two homophobic and anti-Asian slurs within a period of five minutes.
Separately, on April 14, an employee of a Central Square pharmacy was the victim of a physical and verbal assault, according to a police incident report. CPD charged the perpetrator with “Interference With Civil Rights,” according to the report.
The employee was stocking an aisle when a man approached him and repeatedly called him anti-Asian slurs, per the report. The aggressor chest bumped the man and threatened to return with a gun, stating, “I’m gonna get you after work.”
Ryan D. Nguyen ’25, who helped organize a rally in Boston in March condemning hate against Asians, called racially-motivated crimes against Asians “incredibly infuriating.”
“[Universities] have to do a deep dive, brainstorm, reflection, and introspection and make sure they educate themselves on what has happened throughout the country,” Nguyen said. “They need to take it upon themselves to elevate Asian American voices and stories to a point where we feel like we are humanized.”
Nguyen said he believes non-Asian students should “never be silent” and that they should use their various skills — whether they are in photography, journalism, or data science — to support Asian Americans.
“Apathy is the most dangerous thing,” he said. “We can’t afford to have that in the moment.”

The Undergraduate Council voted to pass legislation initiating a student-based campaign to advocate for the creation of a multicultural center at Harvard, as well as legislation to launch a program to disperse water filters to students during a Sunday meeting.
The first act establishes a UC effort which expands on the body’s past advocacy for a multicultural center at Harvard, which in turn built upon five decades of student efforts.
“The student body has been in deep advocacy of a space to convene and appreciate shared identities,” the legislation reads.
The text of the legislation cites other peer institutions that have made similar centers that students met with “great excitement.”
“The power of student voice and testimonial is unmatched in understanding lived experiences,” the act reads.
The new campaign comes one week after the UC passed legislation to create a virtual multicultural center to be used during the coronavirus pandemic.
The campaign would give students the opportunity to share videos, music, art, and poetry indicating why they want a multicultural center at the College, according to the act. The plan for a virtual multicultural center will also be carried out in conjunction with other student organizations.
The legislation was sponsored by UC President Noah A. Harris ’22, Ivy Yard Representative Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, and Adams House Representative Esther J. Xiang ’23. The Council passed it with a motion to adopt by unanimous consent.
The second piece of legislation will distribute charcoal water filters already purchased by the Office of Sustainability to promote the use of reusable water bottles.
“Many students on campus have cited that they avoid using refillable bottle stations due to concerns about the water quality,” reads the legislation.
Per the act, the filters will resolve water quality issues at refilling stations by filtering out specific chemicals of concern from the water supply. Each filter will last for roughly four to six months and can fit into any type of water bottle.
“Students can also bring these filters home for the summer, which would allow students living in areas where water quality is a concern to continue to use their reusable water bottles,” reads the legislation.
The legislation, sponsored by Xiang, passed with a motion to adopt by unanimous consent.

Harvard will launch a Ph.D. program in Quantum Science and Engineering, which it said would be “one of the world’s first,” according to a Monday morning announcement.
The new discipline, which will admit its first cohort of 35 to 40 graduate students in fall 2022, who work at the intersection of physics, chemistry, computer science, and electrical engineering.
While Harvard already has a quantum science and engineering research community through the Harvard Quantum Initiative, the Ph.D. program will mark the first official venture into the emerging field.
Faculty co-director Evelyn L. Hu, a professor of Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering, emphasized that the new program bolsters efficiency through classes designed to fuse science and engineering.
“The core curriculum dramatically reduces the time to basic quantum proficiency for a community of students who will be the future innovators, researchers and educators in quantum science and engineering,” Hu said in the press release.
Physics professor John M. Doyle, who will also serve as faculty co-director, called the new program “necessary and foundational” to the development of the discipline.
“Quantum science and engineering is not just a hybrid of subjects from different disciplines, but an important new area of study in its own right,” he said in the release.
Doyle and Hu previously discussed a proposal for a graduate program in Quantum Science and Engineering at a March 2 faculty meeting. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences then voted to establish the program April 6.
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III said in the press release that the program will be a means of accelerating the University’s exploration of the new field.
“An incredible foundation has been laid in quantum, and we are now at an inflection point to accelerate that activity,” Doyle said.
In an early April interview, Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs expressed excitement for the graduate program.
“We are at the forefront of trying to understand and exploit the really spooky elements of quantum mechanics in a way that may well have significant technological impact on society,” Stubbs said of the Quantum Science and Engineering graduate program.
In the interview, Stubbs also said that the design process is “just getting started” for a new 60 Oxford St. development to house the program.
The space will serve as a “state-of-the-art quantum hub” for collaboration, and will include instructional labs, research labs, and seminar rooms, according to the press release.
Faculty for the program will be drawn from several divisions of the University — SEAS, the Department of Physics, and the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, according to the QSE application page.
Stubbs said in the press release that Harvard is undergoing a search to recruit more faculty who specialize in QSE-related fields.
Applications for the first cycle of the Ph.D. program are due Dec. 15, 2021.

With many of us off campus (and others heading out for the summer in just a few short weeks), you might be missing some of HUDS most iconic sugary sweets. So, no matter how long you’ve been off campus (or if you’ve never been on campus 😔), we’ve got the recipes to recreate some delicious selections from the HUDS dessert offerings to satisfy your sweet tooth! So grab some friends, procrastinate studying for that final paper, have a virtual baking party, and try out these slices of chocolate heaven (in our humble opinion).
Disclaimer: May or may not cause excessive amounts of serotonin and general happiness.
Double Chocolate-Chip Cookies
I’ve heard legends of the HUDS Cookie Bar and the local hotspot Insomnia Cookies’ chocolate chip cookies. If you’re looking to recreate this alleged chocolatey goodness for some late night munchies as you work on your pset or essay, check out this recipe to make your own massive chocolate chunky, drool-worthy cookies.
Ingredients
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour (leveled and sieved)
10 tablespoons margarine or butter (this seems a lot, but it is the KEY to the recipe)
¾ cups sugar (alter to your liking)
1 tablespoon cocoa powder (can be increased for maximum chocolatey-ness)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg (must be large)
A pinch of salt (alter with finger/pinch size)
½ tablespoon baking soda
½ cup chocolate chips (both white and semi-sweet dark chips)
⅔ cups of peanut butter (optional, but you will not regret it)
Cold milk (for drinking, if you take warm milk — no)
Directions
Preheat the oven to 190 degrees Celsius (375 degrees for all of you Daniel Fahrenheit followers). Butter a flat baking pan then line with parchment paper, leaving a few centimeters hanging off the two sides of the pan (you do the centimeters to inches conversion for once, this international student is tired). Sieve the flour and mix in the dry ingredients — salt, baking soda, and cocoa powder. In a different bowl, cream the butter and add in the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy (two to three minutes if using a mixture and five to six minutes if using a hand whisk). Add in the vanilla extract, peanut butter, and eggs, cracking the eggs in a separate bowl and adding them in one by one.
Mix the dry and wet ingredients, adding the dry to the wet in three batches. Incorporate in all the flour, then add in chocolate chips and mix gently with a spatula until evenly mixed into the dough.
Option 1: 
Roll out the dough using some extra flour and cut out shapes with a cookie cutter.
(Much Easier) Option 2: 
Using your hands, make small balls and flatten them using a spatula or a fork for a cool criss-cross design. Put cookies on baking pan and bake for 20-25 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool (optional), remove from baking pan, and serve with COLD milk.
Of course, feel free to alter the recipe to your liking, be it taking them with warm milk or using less butter. We recommend you enjoy these desserts while watching either “The Kissing Booth 2” because Netflix likes to portray Harvard in a very interesting way (do Harvard dorm rooms actually have fireplaces?) or ‘The Princess Switch 2” (spoiler: it’s horrible) because finals are sad and I need to ignore my problems with rom-coms. Happy baking!
Chocolate Whoopie Pie
Sweet chocolate cake paired with a vanilla frosting filling, what could be a more satisfying dessert for your sweet tooth? There is no better way to fill your time procrastinating your psets or studying for finals than baking this scrumptious dessert — while you're at it, why not bake some extras as a sweet surprise for friends and family!
Ingredients
Batter
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
1 1/4 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 cup milk
Filling
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 cups powdered sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
3–4 tbsp milk
Directions
To make these scrumptious sweets, first you must combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Then mix in the egg and vanilla extract, and slowly combine with the milk. Once you have done this, add in your previously mixed dry ingredients to make the chocolaty batter.
Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, scoop out the batter and place on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake this for 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. While the cake portion of the dessert is baking, beat together the butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and milk to make the filling.
Once the cakes are fully cooked and cooled, pipe the buttercream filling onto the cake mounds, and then sandwich two together to make a delectable chocolate whoopie pie similar to the ones HUDS serves. I guarantee if you eat these during your last few Zoom classes of the semester, you will make all your classmates jealous that you have such a delicious dessert to enjoy!

The incoming Class of 2025 might have conquered the lowest admission rate in the history of Harvard College, but thanks to quarantine leaving more than 57,000 high school seniors just bored enough to apply — 15,000 more than in previous years — the low rate still translates into a whole lot of first years. Add to that the 349 students in the Class of 2024 who escaped a year of Zoom by deferring their admission last year, and the College now faces the challenge of accommodating way too many wide-eyed first years in potentially way too little campus housing.
Unless Harvard plans to move from socially-distanced pandemic-era singles to packing first years into Greenough like sardines, it’s going to need to rework its housing situation fast. Luckily, Flyby is here to help. Dean Khurana, here are a few suggestions to consider as you plan for the fall:
The New Science and Engineering Complex
Yeah, the trek to Allston won’t be ideal for first years on their way to Annenberg, but the STEM kids will be right at home. Besides being the newest building on campus, the SEC offers dozens of state-of-the-art lab spaces — what could sound more cozy than that? Like in most dorms in the Yard and the River Houses (Quad pride), first years in the SEC will still have to sleep side-by-side with rodents, but at least the lab mice can be classically conditioned to stop scampering across the room all night.
Cabot Library Second Floor
Let’s not act like people didn’t already pull all-nighters here. Truly ideal for all of the incoming STEM babies: Annenberg is 20 steps away, the stairs serve as a built-in gym, and the floor to ceiling windows give an unbeatable view of the sunrise over the Yard. Everything serves a double purpose, including the pset buddies who double as snuggle buddies on those chilly Boston winter nights. All the amenities you need within a 20-step radius makes Cabot Library prime real estate.
The “Totally Not Haunted” Rooms Above Annenberg
We’re still not entirely sure what these rooms are used for, but living in a 19th century High Victorian Gothic tower sounds like step one of being in a horror movie. With a creaky elevator and countless dusty stained glass windows, even the smell of Red’s very, very, very Best Catch from downstairs might not be enough to ward away the ghosts. Still, first years living up here will be first in line for breakfast every morning and get the most spacey, historic rooms on campus. And after all, what is a ghost but a bonus roommate?
Houseboats (Dormboats?) on the Charles
Row, row, row your dorm gently down the stream! Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, why’s the water green? 🤢
Observatories On Top of The Science Center
A step away from Cabot Library, the Loomis-Michael Observatory dorms would epitomize the home/work divide. Surrounded by metal, first-years will feel right at home in the warm ambiance. The views are out of this world (literally) — just mind the giant telescope as you toss and turn. The only downside here is the influx of Insta pics of the observatory sky views.
Quad Lawn
Remember those giant white tents that started popping up at college campuses at the beginning of the pandemic? Hear us out, Harvard’s 18th first-year dorm: Quad Lawn. All it takes is a large tent and some inflatable beds, and we’ll have the new 10-man (heating not included). It will fit right in with the rest of the not-on-the-Yard Union dorms, so the UC won’t have to worry about extra council representation. FOP-pers will, of course, get first-dibs on this year-long outdoor adventure.
