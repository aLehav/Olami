As Cathleen Whitaker (Jennifer Ellis) and Raymond Deagan (Maurice Parent) separate for what is imagined to be the final time on a train station platform in Hartford, CT, the first ray of of the musical’s potential presents itself. It is just a shame that it took until the last note to materialize.
SpeakEasy Stage Company’s “Far from Heaven,” running from Sept. 12 to Oct. 11, tells the tale of a seemingly perfect suburban family in 1950s America. The story centers on the Whitaker family, which outwardly has everything that a person could ask for. The façade starts to crumble when the Whitakers’ African-American gardener, Raymond Deagan, shows Cathleen the superficiality of their existence. In turn, this leads to a series of shocking realizations for Cathleen about the meaning of her life.
The production, based on Todd Haynes’s movie of the same title, poses questions that do not have very comforting answers—if they have answers at all. Stage director Scott Edmiston asks us whether we are all truly on our own, forced to seek fleeting moments of freedom and clarity. In an attempt to answer such questions, Edmiston creates an intricate retelling of mid-century suburbia. In a world full of sexism, racism, and crystal-clear gender roles, “Far from Heaven” urges us to look deeper. At its core, the production has a very important story to tell concerning the ease with which a person can lose their identity within societal expectations. Unfortunately—despite the musical’s few technical strengths and evocative acting at some points—“Far from Heaven” loses its message amidst a presentation that is at once clichéd and painfully sentimental.
Much of this play rests solely on the petite shoulders of Ellis, who carries the role of sheltered housewife Cathleen Whitaker with varying levels of success. In many ways, Ellis does bring forth a great performance. She succeeds in portraying a woman who really has no idea how to cope with problems outside of her comfortable bubble. Even at the utterance of the smallest criticism or vulgar word, Ellis becomes visibly rattled to show Cathleen’s discomfort. In that respect, Ellis does a very good job of bringing forth the many subtleties of this delicate ecosystem that she resides within. As Ellis’s voice falters during times of tribulation, the audience can audibly perceive Cathleen’s existential existence.
The role limits Ellis’s performance when it forces Ellis to evoke nothing more than a cookie-cutter homemaker. It is unfortunate that Ellis does not push the constraints of this narrow role; at times her performance feels like a hollow shell of what it could be. During a litany of scenes in the second act when Cathleen begins to fundamentally question who she is, the actress sometimes presents a performance that feels void of emotional depth. Ellis is far too mechanical for a story that asks such fundamentally essential questions.
Continuing the trend of being too simple to a fault, Scott Frankel’s and Michael Korie’s score sometimes feels almost manipulative in the way that it tries to evoke specific emotions throughout the show. Many tunes and lyrics are rather bland and forgettable. With his direction, Edmiston fails to improve upon the rather unsophisticated score that he was given to work with. However, there are gems within the score that truly standout. The haunting dread that persistently emanates during the song “The Only One” is truly exceptional. Ellis’s voice, which at times is barely above a whisper, is truly spine-tingling.
Similarly, the heavy-handed and simple lighting is a tool gone awry. During troubling scenes, the stage is bathed in rich, blue light. When Cathy is wearing a red dress, the lights are red. The lighting in many ways distract from the story, as it feels like the viewer is being constantly reminded of the fact that he or she is supposed to feel sad during a scene where the sky is dark blue—unnecessary reminders in a musical already laden with thematic complexity.
One of the saving graces of the production, though, is the cleverly constructed set, which contributes to the underlying message of the musical. The space uses various empty picture frames, windows, and doorways to represent the pervasive oppression of 1950s society. The empty picture frames illuminate the hollow nature of the culture that Whitaker inhabits. Just as the set is restricted by the constraints of windows and picture frames, so is Cathleen Whitaker curbed by the world of white suburbia. Cathleen is locked within predetermined expectations. No longer is Cathleen an individual—seemingly shackled to the expectations of what it is to be a housewife, Cathleen begins to lose her identity.
In the end, all that is left of the product is something that is eerily reminiscent of a made-for-TV Hallmark Channel movie. The creative team does earnestly attempt to avoid the pitfalls that the musical naturally elicits. Unfortunately, the performance eventually regresses to the melodramatic tune that dominates the musical, which undermines the real message of the musical.

UPDATED: September 24, 2014, at 11:42 p.m.
The Loeb Classical Library Foundation and the Harvard University Press announced last week that the entire Loeb Classical Library would be digitized and put online for a fee. Their efforts to make these resources more widely available are commendable and show the potential for future digitization projects.
The original intent of the Loeb Classical Library, which contains a series of 520 volumes of ancient Greek and Roman literature, was to improve accessibility to the works of classical authors – the great historians, poets, philosophers, playwrights and orators of antiquity. To this end, each book, with either a red cover for Latin or green for Greek, contains the original writing on the left-hand pages and the English translation on the right. The series was a success from the very beginning; not long after the original publication of the books, Virginia Woolf wrote in a 1917 review for The Times Literary Supplement that “the Loeb Library…comes as a gift of freedom.”
The move to digitize the Library advances the original ideal and intent of the library. By placing the entirety of the Library’s texts online for subscribers to enjoy and introducing the capability to annotate and search the texts, the Foundation has brought these texts to an even wider audience. Furthermore, the texts that have been now made available online through the Loeb generally contain translations of a higher quality than what can be currently found on the internet, while also costing less – for individuals or for institutions – than the price of the hard copy of all the books in the Loeb series. In fact, the efforts by the LCL Foundation and the Harvard University Press to ensure the affordability of the digital Loeb deserve recognition as well.
And while we often lament the decline of the humanities here at Harvard, the digitization of the Loeb Classical Library represents the ideal for the future – one where science and technology can be used to benefit and advance the study of the humanities. Whereas we generally focus on the marginalization of the humanities due to increased emphasis on the sciences, the Loeb Classical Library Foundation and Harvard University Press have managed to marry the two. The new online version of the Library – especially the tools for annotation, note-taking, sharing, toggling, and highlighting – would not have been possible without the technological advancements of the past few decades.
A quotation often falsely attributed to Cicero (one of the ancient Romans whose writing is preserved in the Loeb) reads, “A room without books is like a body without a soul.” Regardless of the origins of the phrase, its spirit resonates loud and clear and the digitization of the Loeb embraces that spirit, that love of books and literature; it embodies and enhances the original mission of the Library.

CORRECTION: September 24, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the red and green book covers signified Greek and Latin books respectively.  In fact, Latin books are bound in red and Greek books in green.

David Farragut was Hispanic, at least according to the National Hispanic Heritage website. That’s right–the decorated American admiral with a French last name had a father who was born in Minorca. Never mind that the father himself had been a renowned American admiral who had Anglicized his name from “Jordi” to “George.”
If it were only that simple now. As we find ourselves in another Hispanic Heritage Month (which runs from September 15 to October 15), it’s as if the standard for being “Hispanic” has changed. In an attempt to weed out the impostors, we have come up with the term “Latino” and its subsequent modifiers, all in an attempt at creating some sort of purer identity.
That is why I own a ridiculously ugly hat that prominently features a Dominican flag. The words “REP. DOMINICANA” are misguidedly, awkwardly emblazoned in a vertical line running from the tip to the edge of the brim.
There was a time when I felt compelled to wear the stupid thing. The reason was simple: it was the only external sign of my nationality. So I would perch it awkwardly on top of my head, desperately hoping that people walking by would notice that, yes, I was Dominican, not just another white kid.
It is interesting to watch how people come to identify with a racial or national identity. This is especially true during those sacred college years–the time when you are supposed to discover who you really are. We are more naturally attracted to groups that promise shared experiences. These experiences don’t have to be meaningful–it’s the reason why I immediately feel a bond with people who know what it is like to taste a good mangú.
At the same time, however, I often find myself looking down at people who don’t pass my Latino snuff test.  In turn, I find myself being subjected to the same standard, with fellow Latinos questioning everything from the color of my skin to my taste in music. Some things you can change, others, not so much.
This is not only true of Latinos. Every racial group has a certain way of acting. And if you don’t speak the right way, do the right things, stand up for the right causes, then you don’t qualify as being “[insert racial identity here]” enough. The further we get away from our “origins,” the more we tend to idealize them. The more abstract this idea becomes, the more we search out real, tangible things or causes that will set us apart.
The problem is not with people identifying as part of a specific race. The problem is that oftentimes being part of a group means that you pledge your allegiance to a predetermined sense of identity. It is for this reason that racial causes fail in their attempt at creating a real community. Rather, what they provide is an artificial barrier to forming a healthy sense of community with people who are not like us.
Current attempts at defining race are sorely, sadly misguided. It seems like we often try to hide behind our skin color or where our parents grew up instead of actually trying to accomplish something independent of that. There is no denying that race is an important component of identity. As a matter of fact, I am still incredibly proud of the fact that I am Dominican. But that search for identity is rooted in something that is, by nature, deeply selfish: A validation that I belong somewhere.
I am not suggesting that we stop taking pride in our heritage. But heritage is not one amorphous mass that involves the experience of people like me. I am not like other Hispanics or Latinos. I am not like other Dominicans. I am not like other members of the Fernández family. And that’s fine–because my concern should not be to spend my time with people who are like me. It should be to use my set of experiences to contribute to a world that is drastically different from mine.
Looking back, I find myself laughing at my attempts to prove my Dominican-ness.  For instance, my attempts to speak street-savvy Spanglish led to bewildered, puzzled reactions from my family. My hat, although still valuable to me, now sits on top of a bookshelf, at a safe distance from the top of my head.
Whether people selectively play up their race or are engaged fully with their roots, they are playing up one part of who they are. Since our kindergarten years, we have been taught that people are more than their racial identity. After all, we don’t celebrate David Farragut because he was keenly aware of his Hispanic roots. As a matter of fact, he probably didn’t care.

J. Gram Slattery '15, “The People's Republic.”  If national politics is complicated, then the politics of Harvard and the Millenial community is nearly nonsensical. “The People’s Republic” seeks to make sense of the complex issues relevant to young people and Cantabrigians—while having some fun along the way.  This column will appear on alternate Wednesdays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
Your article about Monday’s faculty discussion with William Deresiewicz—“In Heated Discussion, ‘Excellent Sheep’ Author Fields Criticism from Faculty, Students”—presents the conduct of some of our faculty and administrators toward Dr. Deresiewicz as fair contributions to a reasonable discussion; in fact, they were often unworthy of our values.
As the article reports, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana asked Deresiewicz what he “[missed] most about being an academic.” The article doesn’t put the question in context. Deresiewicz is no longer an academic because Yale denied him tenure. Dean Khurana could only have mocked a peer more uncharitably if he had asked his predecesor, Professor Evelynn Hammonds, what she missed most about being a dean.
Consider the article’s statement that one of Deresiewicz’s remarks “elicit[ed] a response” from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, who spoke “when the audience was given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel.” That’s true, but it elides this: When the moderator asked the audience for questions—which, as I understand them, typically end in question marks and ask something—Dean Smith, one of our university’s highest academic administrators, made a polemical statement instead.
Moreover, the article omits the most disingenuous maneuver of the evening. In an attempt to set up a “gotcha” moment, Professor Diana Sorenson asked Deresiewicz why he thought students shouldn’t do internships. When Deresiewicz said he didn’t hold that view, Sorenson dramatically opened his book and read a line which seemed to confirm her account of his position—eliciting raucous laughter and applause from the crowd. Stunned, Deresiewicz asked her to read the entire paragraph the line came from, insisting that in context, the sentence in question addressed only students taking a gap year. Sorenson declined, and Deresiewicz was denied a chance to defend himself.
As a student, I’m embarrassed that administrators and faculty members would violate the basic norms of a panel discussion in order to score points against a thoughtful critic. In framing what happened as part of a constructive but “heated” discussion, the article legitimizes conduct that undermines our values and shields it from deserved scrutiny.
As a community ostensibly committed to reflection, dialogue, and the values that sustain them, we only do ourselves a disservice when we treat those we disagree with so unfairly—not to mention confirm some of Deresiewicz’s most biting critiques of who we are.

William Deresiewicz stirred up a frenzy last July with his New Republic article, “Don’t Send Your Kids to the Ivy League.” Before appearing on a panel moderated by Professor Homi K. Bhabha, Deresiewicz entertained FM’s questions. The following interview has been edited for concision and is an excerpt.
Fifteen Minutes: How do you feel your views have evolved since you ignited conversation about the Ivy League?
William Deresiewicz: They’ve evolved in a number of important ways. At that time, it was really only a critique, and it wasn’t that different from what was in The New Republic recently[...] It’s about, you know, a real college education and a liberal arts education, how students as individuals can save themselves from the system, and it doesn’t even require that you transfer out of Harvard. People ask me a lot of different questions, but many of them boil down to, “What should we do?”—either as individuals or as a society or a set of institutions. So, that’s the big new thing.

FM: What do you hope to accomplish by writing and talking about this subject? 
WD: What I hope to accomplish is to allow individual people who are in the system to do things differently. I do talk about the admissions process, and I think it’s a hard nut to crack. It’s easy to articulate principles and harder to put those into policy. I don’t want to use any of the rubric that we’re using now. But basically, one big change I want to see is to get away from this, what well-roundedness has become, which is, what, you check every box. I would like Harvard to admit kids who aren’t that concerned about getting into Harvard.
FM: A recent article on The New York Times ranks Harvard as one of the most economically diverse top colleges. Does that change your argument at all?
WD: I think it may be one of the most economically diverse of the selective schools, but[…] it is in fact still a very, very class-stratified school. It is. It may be a little bit better than some of its peers, mainly because it has more money to spend on financial aid, but the percentage of lower income kids at Harvard is still tiny. The percentage of even middle class kids at Harvard is still small. And this speaks huge problems in the meritocracy, in higher education, so I’m glad that Harvard is doing a little better, but it’s not that much better. In fact, there was another piece in the Times a few weeks ago, that said that there has been no improvement in the top school overall, in inequality. No improvement in like 20 years.
FM: At college, did you feel like an excellent sheep? An A- sheep? A B sheep?
WD: We didn’t have the same crazy system we did then, so I didn’t prepare myself for the admissions process the way people do now. I’m sure that if I were a kid now, I absolutely would be an excellent sheep. There’s no question about it given the family that I came from.
FM: As a professor, how did you discern an excellent sheep from a non-sheep student? Are there any specific characteristics that we should know about?
WD: I want to say this very clearly and I understand that the way I presented my argument, let alone the way The New Republic did, obscures this, but I do say this in the book. It isn’t like the sheep and the goats. There’s a large continuum. There’s no line dividing sheep from non-sheep. And I think my favorite student to interact with was a sheep who was beginning to develop self-consciousness and no longer wanted to be a sheep.

Another day, another opportunity to forestall contemplation of the anxiety and splendor of existence by fiddling with my blood alcohol level. This week, a feat of daring and potential product endorsement: the Charles Shaw challenge. Three different bottles of “the world famous” $2.99 whites. One different me. “Charles Shaw” corrects to “Charles shame” on my iPhone.
Charles Shaw Pinot Grigio ($2.99, Trader Joe’s)
It’s Friday night, and because I am a confident single woman, I swirl the Pinot Grigio around in my mouth sensually/spittily, activating my sommelier powers. I’m sensing notes of white chocolate—the shitty kind I got in my Sunday school Easter basket—and a waft of the green grapes that grew inedibly from my grandmother’s trellis. This is accompanied by a wasabi-type feeling that makes me crinkle my nose adorably. Like most things, this wine goes really well with cookies. The Pinot Grigio also has distinct notes of chicken, which is a ridiculous claim to make considering that wine is just burnt-out grape juice. Of course this wine doesn’t taste like chicken. It’s an urban legend that everything tastes like chicken. That was cleared up on MythBusters.
Charles Shaw Chardonnay($2.99, Trader Joe’s)
The Chardonnay tastes like your mouth does after you clamp it around an orange wedge and pretend the rind is your teeth, fooling everyone. With overtones of arugula and garlic. It is also noticeably curvier than the other two, with the kind of rich, lush mouthfeel basic straight dudes evoke when comparing women to food products. In transporting the brew from the cup to my mouth—a tricky little flick-of-the-wrist that may be difficult for people with carpal tunnel syndrome—I am distracted from its gently narcotic bouquet by my nails, which are crisper and more intoxicating than this chardonnay. They are gold and sparkly, because I am a fierce bitch, and rather short, for sexual purposes. Joke: in girl on girl porn, how do you tell the real from the faux lesbian? Punchline: nail length. When I told this joke to my sister once, she said “ew” and changed the subject. Diversity has its limits.
Charles Shaw Sauvignon Blanc
($2.99, Trader Joe’s)
The sauvignon blanc is the color of urine when you are well-hydrated, “the kind of greenish color that suggests it will be very sweet,” says my roommate, who obviously pees very differently than I do. The savignon blanc is indeed sweeter than the pinot grigio. Maybe more of a dessert wine, or a drink-by-yourself-at-two-am-on-a-Friday wine, or the kind of wine you drink when you can’t even masturbate because you live in the common room and honestly at this point I am drunk and unsure what wine is coming from what bottle. Meanwhile, my roommate is sitting in the Ikea chair biting her own thumb with what I can only assume to be autoeroticism. She is not even drinking.

In order to share assigned readings with their students, many Harvard professors post materials on their course websites. Are these professors violating copyright laws? Kyle K. Courtney, a copyright advisor and program manager in Harvard’s Office for Scholarly Communication, works in conjunction with Harvard libraries on copyright matters. He shared his thoughts on this sticky issue with Fifteen Minutes.
Fifteen Minutes Magazine: Tell us a bit about the issue. Are professors posting work online legally, or are these copyright violations going under the radar?
Kyle K. Courtney: I would like to say that it was tolerated, I think, by publishers for a while. But then I think that that time has come to an end to a certain extent... In November of 2013, Harvard received 23 takedown notices from a publisher.
FM: What laws are professors violating when they post copyrighted work online?
KKC: If they don’t own the copyright and someone else owns the copyright, then they are violating Section 106, basically, of copyright law… That is the small bundle of rights that is owned and operated by the copyright holder… Every copyright owner has a little bundle of rights: the right to reproduce the work or recopy, the right to prepare derivative works, the right to distribute copies of the work to the public, the right to perform the work, and the right to display the work. When you sign a contract signing away all those bundle of rights … then when you’re posting stuff online that is technically not yours anymore, you’re violating both the reproduction and the distribution, perhaps even the performance for a display.

Last summer, Timothy Doner ’18 delivered three speeches: one to a group of Apple executives, another for a live and web audience at TEDxTeen, and a third in front of a live audience of 25,000 in Orlando, Fla.
Doner has achieved that coveted hallmark of true fame—­his own Wikipedia page—as well as another, less celebrated accolade—a slightly over-hyped representation by the media, a result of what he dubs the “dancing bear effect.” The reason for this storm of media attention?
Doner has studied upwards of 20 languages since his early teens, earning him the description of hyperpolyglot.
“It sounds like a thyroid condition,” says Doner. “Oddly enough, it’s not.”
Doner, a New York City native and current resident of Stoughton South, says he tries not to get too caught up in the semantics of hyperpolyglottery, though he’ll happily break down the word’s Greek and Latin roots for you. Doner characterizes the debate over terms for people like him as “cultish.” For Doner, the problem with debates like these, as well as much of the media exposure he’s gotten over the past few years, is that they focus on the “sexy headline”: Teen Prodigy Speaks Ten Languages, Can Insult You in Twenty-Five. In fact, Doner says, this isn’t true—or at least, it isn’t the right way to think about language.
“What does it mean to speak a language? Technically you and I speak English, but if confronted with a legal text or a Shakespearean text or maybe some very obtuse form of poetry, you would be just as in the dark as a foreigner,” Doner says. “So, in a lot of ways, you’re still learning your native language every day. From that end I think it takes a big act of hubris to say, ‘I speak X language,’ or, ‘I’m fluent in X languages.’” Doner prefers to talk about the cultural backgrounds and interactions of languages he’s studied, and, when given the chance, to explain that he considers himself fluent in about five or six tongues—including French, Farsi, Arabic, Hebrew, and German. He humbly explains that he’s familiar, conversant, or engaged in about 15 more, ranging from Indonesian and Pashto to Ojibwe, a Native American language, and several African languages, including South African Xhosa, which he says he picked up mainly “because of the clicks.”
Doner’s motivation for this extensive study varies from language to language, but his overarching focus is culture. “Any sort of interest you have in your English-speaking world, you can multiply that many times over by learning a foreign language,” he says.
Doner’s run with language and mimicry had an early start in a childhood acting career which included assorted commercials, a near miss for the role of Dash in The Incredibles, and a brief stint as the voice of a talking bird on a Nickelodeon show also featuring Whoopi Goldberg, which was canceled before airing (“Understandably—it was an awful show,” according to Doner).
Doner says his most memorable experiences with language outside of awkward interactions with the media—including being asked if he “spoke Muslim” on air—have been conversations with native speakers he meets online, or in the diverse neighborhoods of New York. Once, Doner says, a cab driver pulled over en route and called his extended family in Egypt so that Doner could converse with them, “to insist that I was real.”
Many of the foreign language speakers Doner meets don’t expect him to be able to talk with them. Doner relishes the opportunity to converse, however, and says he’s more often than not met with constructive criticism, encouragement, and delight. “I think seeing that level of shock is the funniest thing,” he says.
While Doner hopes to continue his study of language at Harvard, diving into ancient tongues, including Sumerian and Sanskrit, his larger focus has shifted to linguistics. Doner is particularly interested in Indo-European, an early macrofamily of languages from which most European languages are descended.
He also hopes to continue some of the publicity and social media outreach he’s done to get more people, especially kids and teens, excited about independent study of languages. Programs like the Rosetta Stone challenge, which invited students to study a language for a month and then post videos online in order to compete for language-learning products, help break down the “mystified” quality of foreign languages, and, says Doner, chip away at the stereotype of the “dumb American” by removing some of the xenophobia and cultural barriers that come with being a part of a monolingual culture.
Besides, says Doner, hyperpolyglottery is fun: “Some people do Rubik’s Cubes; I do languages.”
Still, Doner isn’t taking any languages this semester, and is open to other options for the future. “I could become an astrology major, you never really know.” He continues, “Is that a thing? If that’s a thing, definitely. What is liberal education for?”

“Why’d you go to school?” Katherine K. Merseth, senior lecturer on education at Harvard Graduate School of Education, asks. It takes me a second to realize that this is not a rhetorical question. “You didn’t think I was going to ask you a question did you?” she says, smiling, in response to my silence.
“I’m fascinated by that question because no one ever asks it,” Merseth continues. “We’re all swimming in this water but nobody knows what water is.”
She sits across the table from me in her office in Longfellow Hall, tucked behind Cambridge Common, speaking openly as she turns what could have been a straightforward interview into a conversation, asking about my story throughout our chat: “Where did you go to high school? What are you studying?”
Merseth notes that people see education as having all kinds of different purposes: to build professional skills, to empower students who are otherwise powerless, to enable students to become the inherently better people that education makes them. “That’s what makes education hard in this country,” she explains. “We don’t have a fundamental agreement across the populace about why we have schools.”
It’s a question Merseth pursues in her incredibly popular course, USW 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education.” This past semester, several hundred students lotteried for the class, which has just 75 spaces. Merseth casually slips into the conversation the fact that it has a score of 4.8 on the Q Guide.
“Teaching [this course] has completely and totally restored my faith in education and the potential of young people to make a difference in the world,” she says. “It just fills me up every day.
Merseth majored in math at Cornell University, and after she graduated, decided between pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematics or a teaching degree. She chose teaching.
“Personality-wise it was a great decision because I am very much of an extrovert, [an] outgoing person who likes to engage with people,” she explains. “Being a math Ph.D. you sit in an office by yourself and think weird thoughts that you can’t share with anyone.”
Merseth got a master’s degree in education from GSE and, after spending ten years working in schools, first as a high school math teacher and then a curriculum coordinator, she returned to Harvard, where she earned her doctorate and joined the Harvard faculty.
Early in her career, she says that she thought a lot about “content knowledge”—how to improve teaching techniques. “Being kind of an analytical puzzle-solver type of person,” she says, “I’m just driven to figure out how to [teach] better.” But as she got older, her focus evolved. Her current research looks mostly at charter schools, a movement that Merseth supports.
“[Charter schools] are a wedge into a rather complacent monopolistic education system that has not changed or responded to the needs of children,” she says.
Though there has been tremendous political pushback on charters, she is optimistic about the success of the system. She does note, however, that she sees charters as somewhat of a “missed opportunity.” Given a blank canvas on which to reimagine school systems, Merseth says, she wishes that the educators and administrators behind charters had designed more innovative schools.
When I ask about her opinions of teachers unions, Merseth does not hold back. “I’d get rid of them,” she declares bluntly. “I think they have seriously hampered educational progress in this country because they are so focused on job protection.” Merseth had the option to join a union when she first started teaching, but chose not to do so: “I don’t see the leadership,” she explains. “I don’t see the enlightenment.”On the topic of Teach for America, Merseth’s criticisms are even more severe. Though she applauds TFA for the program’s recruitment and branding strategies, she believes TFA should be “harshly criticized” for their inadequate training and their lack of support for young teachers. Though TFA wants people to think that they’re in it for the kids, she says, in reality they are “in it for themselves,” and are simply using the students “as guinea pigs.”
With that, Merseth—who labels herself an “academic entrepreneur”—launches into an explanation of her response to TFA’s problematic structure: the Harvard Teacher Fellowship. Her initiative, which will be in place for seniors in the Class of 2016 to apply to, is aimed at getting Harvard students excited about teaching while also providing the training and support that Merseth says is absent in TFA. The fellowship will involve six months of coursework and training before placement in a school, and will have a strong support system during the year, with coaching and webinars. At the end of the two years, students can earn a master’s degree by taking just two courses.
“We intend it to be this great way to get into teaching, but to do it right,” Merseth says.
She’s also working on implementing an Education Studies secondary field for undergraduates, as well as an Institute of Education modelled after the IOP. The IOE will be a “funnel of education opportunities,” with internships, public service groups, and fellows.
Merseth explains that though Harvard students won’t all become teachers, they should all understand the issues. Since she became interested in education practice and policy, Merseth has seen firsthand how pressing its problems are. “Some of the scales have fallen off my eyes and I can see the tremendous inequities that exist in our society today,” she tells me. Education, Merseth believes, is “the civil rights issue of our time.”

Christian T. Rudder ’97 is not a statistician by trade, but the 39-year-old founder of OkCupid just so happens to be a pioneer in a certain branch of data analytics—the data behind love and romance. Since starting his blog OkTrends in 2009, Rudder has uncovered all sorts of statistical trends: the effects of race on dating and interactions, the most successful profile pictures on dating sites, and the questions that are good predictors of whether a woman will have sex on the first date (ask her if she likes beer). Along the way, Rudder has also written for Sparknotes, played guitar for rock group Bishop Allen, and starred in the movie “Funny Ha Ha,” which The New York Times’s A.O. Scott listed in his top 10 films of 2005. FM had the opportunity to chat with Rudder, who published “Dataclysm,” a book based off his findings, in early September.
Fifteen Minutes Magazine: You’ve uncovered a lot of interesting trends for OkCupid. Which trend do you personally find the most interesting?Christian T. Rudder: Which do I find the most interesting? It’s hard to say for OkCupid, since it’s all so old hat to me at this point. The things I’m finding most interesting are the things people at Facebook are figuring out, just because they’re working with different data. These guys in the UK have been able to use people’s Facebook ‘likes’ to predict all this crazy stuff: your race with 95 percent accuracy, whether you’re a man or woman, all the way down to whether your parents got divorced before you were 21 with 60 percent accuracy. It’s a pretty amazing degree of accuracy.
FM: So do you think humans are becoming predictable?CTR: Yes, in a narrow sense, in terms of how they’re going to want to use an interface. That’s hard to argue with. FM: The things you write about provide interesting narratives, but are there any broader applications of your findings?CTR: All the findings are different, so it depends. But as far as sociology issues, in general, the answer is probably yes. Race, for example, is a pretty taboo topic, and interracial relations in this country are problematic, so the extent to which you can get real numbers behind something is a good way to move the discussion and conversation forward. FM: Have you come across any negative responses for trying to cover these taboo topics?CTR: People have generally been pretty positive. There are some people who are like, “what is this good for?” But I think that’s a question that too many CS majors have also asked too many English majors about what they’re doing. The “what is it good for” type of question isn’t really—I don’t think there can be a demonstrated use in advance of a finding. FM: In the book, you write, “If Big Data’s two running stories have been surveillance and money, for the last three years I’ve been working on a third: the human story.” Can you elaborate on that?CTR: I started the book when Facebook was having its IPO and there was a lot of ink spilled on how much money they were all going to make, so I just started thinking to myself there are much bigger stories here than the economic one. Whether it’s marketers or the government kind of watching us, the public isn’t that excited about either of these stories. It’s not something people really get behind. So I just wanted to tell something of a little more practical interest to people, writing about sex, race, and attraction and all that stuff. FM: Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, called being a statistician today’s new “sexy” job, in the same way computer science has been a top skill in this past decade. Do you agree?CTR: I was not a stats major, and I think a lot of the hardcore stats elements of this job are way overblown. I see a lot of problems where people apply really inappropriate tools to relatively simple questions just because they can. So I don’t know. I think it takes as much knowledge about human nature as it does about arching statistical methods. But I’m sure he’s right—he sounds like he knows better than I do. FM: At Harvard, you were initially an English concentrator but switched to Math. How much of what you learned here do you use in your current work? CTR: Oh God, almost none. I’m trying to think. I was definitely not one of the Math 55 guys. The stuff I studied was more like algebra, and that’s just not so useful here. I guess I use a little bit of combinatorics. “M choose N” type situations come up in real life. FM: Did you do any data analytics projects at Harvard?CTR: No. All I did was my problem sets. I wasn’t really into data at all. I guess I made this little program for stockbrokers that took their financial statements and made little graphs and stuff out of it. So that’s sort of data, but nothing like what I do now. FM: Aren’t a lot of your current coworkers also Harvard grads?CTR: I had one class with one of the other founders of OkCupid. All of my co-founders did go to Harvard, but I only got to know them afterwards. That being said, I might not have gotten to know them at all if we had not gone to school together. That relationship definitely made the degree work out, regardless of whether or not I use group theory in real life. FM: You’ve been in rock groups and starred in your Harvard roommate Andrew J. Bujalski’s film “Funny Ha Ha,” which is widely considered to be the first mumblecore film. Do you see a common thread in your career choices?CTR: No, although since you pointed it out, I guess all the things I do tend to be with other Harvard grads. All those relationships—in my band and movie and OkCupid—are from school. So I guess that’s the common thread.

“Ideally, each House should feel like a semi-autonomous community within Harvard. They should truly be houses—places where students feel at home, forming close bonds with House masters, staff, and each other. ”—“Let Them Eat Where They Please,” The Harvard Crimson.
It’s always refreshing to pick up a Crimson editorial and instead find yourself reading a brochure for Harvard; it reminds you what an idyllic place you thought your house would be. You believed you’d sit down with strangers and jump straight into metaphysics or social justice. That opening rush would be followed by a series of chance encounters over chickwiches, the happenstance odd meals that led to you being best of friends. Then you got in on Housing Day, grew up, and realized that sophomore year means a schedule of rotating lunch dates, dinners with blockmates, sprints through Fly-By, and work-meals where you hope you’ll be left alone in the back of the dining hall.
How often do you eat an unscheduled dinner without texting anyone before and end up eating with a housemate you want to know better? What about sitting with five, ten housemates, a couple of whom you’ve never met before? Chances are they also live in San Francisco or read Jacques Derrida or sneak off to bikram yoga in the Square or have something else in common with you—like maybe the tiny, tiny College you both attend.
Hate the once-a-week infringement on your complete autonomy all you want, but Community Dinner is a way to bring those moments back to life. Community doesn’t arise naturally; it takes active steps to build—though in most places those steps can be ground-up or top-down.
Thinking along the “ground-up” lines, the piece calls for “House and Masters and Tutors [to] take an active role in encouraging intra-House bonding,” which is hilarious, since that’s all they spend their time doing. Harvard students, like tired mules, are besieged by ‘active-role’ carrots—or rather monkey-bread teas. Our administration desperately begs us to invest in House community, but we grab the food and ridicule the formals.
The fact is, carrots don’t motivate Harvard students. In our consumer-based, opportunity-overwhelmed collegiate system, we’re assaulted by these orange roots: Supreme Court justices stopping by to speak, parties everywhere all the time, guaranteed future employment if we just attend that extra OCS event. Adding an extra carrot won’t bring a house together, but maybe some “bureaucratic dicta” can. Maybe these adults know something that us excellent sheep are missing, something about the idea that certain rules and boundaries force us into uncomfortable and productive situations. That you might have to reschedule another catch-up or team-dinner, but that you might meet someone incredible—or even someone terrible who becomes your permanent cocktail anecdote.
And if you really hate community, just sneak in, sit down, and stop the snark. It’s really not too hard.

Walk into a student’s bedroom (especially those who study English or comparative literature or [special concentration]) and you’ll often see an impressive book collections of the “non-required” variety. FM asked the following seniors about their favorite books and genres, the novels they’re excited to read, and the works they wish they had time to learn more about. Each recommended a bookshelf they admired, and we followed the extensive trail.
Matt S. Krane ’15: English concentrato, writing a creative thesis on poetry
“I, more than most people in the English concentration, enjoy a wide variety of genres. Some of these genres are not ‘classy’, or ‘cool’ to like as an English concentrator. So for example I like young adult fiction a lot. I really like ‘The Hunger Games.’ I also read a lot of fantasy like ‘Eye of the World’ by Robert Jordan. I think there’s a lot to be learned from that kind of writing because clearly something in it strikes an deeply pleasurable chord for many people. I like things that are great in their own genre form: I love good mysteries, good fantasy, good sci-fi. That’s half of what you would find.”
Krane’s interest in fantasy and young adult is clear in books he’s currently reading. “There’s young adult novels I still want to read—there’s a book called Lexicon that I want to read. I’m halfway through ‘The Magicians’ by Lev Grossman. Again, some of the ‘less classy’ stuff.”
Pointing to his poetic interests, Krane notes, “You’ll find obscure poetry. Rilke is somebody I love. … I would love to read more Leslie Scalapino. Alice Oswald is another one. She wrote a crazy poem that’s basically every  death scene from the Iliad—she just translated only the death scenes. It’s called ‘Memorial’. That’s pretty brilliant.”
Recommended Reader: Julian Lucas
Julian C. Lucas ‘15: Comparative literature concentrator, president of The Harvard Advocate
Of the big greats, Julian notes that he loves Moby-Dick. He also extols Russian titans like Vladimir Nabokov and Nikolai Gogol, listing “Pale Fire,” “Lolita,” and “Dead Souls” as favorites.
“My favorite fiction writer is Vladmir Nabokov. Especially ‘Pale Fire’. Right now I’m very obsessed with these two writers, Ishmael Reed and Derek Walcott. They both are interested in voodoo and the history of the African Diaspora.
“Walcott’s famous work is ‘Omeros’: It’s about St. Lucian fishermen, but it’s patterned after Homer, basically. He uses the Homeric epic to create a Caribbean epic. Reed’s big book is ‘Mumbo Jumbo’, which is a voodoo rewriting of American history, which is also hilarious satire. It’s a mind-blowing book, I would recommend it to anyone.”
Lucas actually does manage to find time for pleasure reading through the semester. “I read ‘The Good Lord Bird’ this summer—it won the National Book Award last year. It’s about John Brown and the raid on Harper’s Ferry. It’s almost like Don Quixote-something; it’s a satirical rollicking story… It’s one of the funniest books I’ve read in a long time, and it was also very moving. ‘Your Face in Mine’, by Jess Row. It’s about racial reassignment surgery; it’s a sci-fi book about race in America. … It’s a fascinating book. The author also wrote a fascinating essay about being a white straight writer whose main inspiration is James Baldwin and how people react to that and how thinking about that played into the writing of this book.”
Recommended Reader: Indiana Seresin
Indiana T. Seresin ’15: Joint Concentrator in comparative literature and women and gender studies
“A big part of my bookshelf is feminist theory and feminist philosophy. That’s my primary academic and otherwise-life interest. I have a lot of books leftover from a tutorial last year that was completely self directed on my own interest on afro-futurism. It’s sort of vaguely defined, radical political and aesthetic movement that thinks about the place of race in our conceptualization of the future and of scientific development, technological progress, outer-space—it sort of centers on race and questions of identity and sexuality as well.”
Seresin, an inactive Crimson editor, recommends a specific starting point for those following in her literary footsteps. “I would start with Samuel Delaney, who is a black, gay science fiction writer who has written a lot of fiction as well as really great critical work. I also really like Octavia Butler, who is also a wonderful science fiction writer. There are a few good anthologies, of essays and critical work about afro-futurism, that are engaging and dynamic and accessible. It’s funny though because I have this huge academic interest in science fiction, in how it relates to philosophy and utopian studies, but unlike just about everyone else I know who studies sci-fi, who comes at it as a fan—before I started reading it I never read sci-fi. It’s really interesting in a way.”

Imagine that on a warm, bright day in whatever month they usually do this sort of thing, the United States Congress tables all other bills and pushes through, unanimously, one that prevents all legal residents of non-contiguous states (that is: Alaskans, Hawaiians) from being anywhere within the contiguous 48 for the entire month of, oh, let’s say September.
Let me tell you: I commiserate with our hypothetically misbegotten Alaskans and Hawaiians. In fact, I’ve never felt so close to a hypothetical group of people in my life. I can’t stop thinking about them. I blush to admit this: I have fallen in love with a nice, hypothetical Alaskan girl, to whom I write gushing, hypothetical letters and send large, hypothetical fruit-baskets—though she’s yet to send me any hypothetical replies. This leaves me hypothetically depressed.
The reason I love these people so much is that I see in their plight a little bit of myself. I live in the Quad, and so the new community dinner night—all Thursday, every Thursday—is, more or less, a rocket-powered slap in the face to all those who would deign participate in weekly extracurriculars down by the Charles.
And what are their reasons? They tell us it’s meant to cut down on confusion, which is preposterous, because it assumes that under the old system the following scenario played out on a fairly regular basis:
I walk into Adams House. I try to swipe in. They turn me away. So bemused am I that I barely manage to wend my way out of the House, back into the street. On the street, I immediately trip. I spend 20 minutes trying to retie my shoelaces, before realizing that my shoes are Velcroed. This is too much. I abandon my shoes. After banging my head against a brick wall to help gather my thoughts, I realize there is nowhere for me to go. I shall go hungry tonight.
They tell us, too, that it’s meant to “build a sense of community.” But what if I don’t like my community? What if I have vaguely hashed out reservations about the whole grander concept of “community” itself? What if I was left scarred by a particularly rough stint in a biodynamically-minded commune when I was but a tender youth, and consequently begin to heavy-breathe when anyone so much as mentions the c-word?
What if my House just smells weird?
All in all, it’s a terrible idea, and you have to hope it’s going to change. But until that glorious day, when the gleaming doors of dining halls everywhere are thrust open to the hordes of huddled Quadlings, when we realize that even those who live on the outskirts of society must eat to survive—well, until then you’ll find me on the corner of Plympton and Bow, biding my time til 7 p.m., clutching my gurgling gut and repeating to passersby that timeless mantra of the Quadling: “I ain’t hungry. Who, me? No siree!”

--------------------------------------------
UPDATED: September 25, 2014, at 1:15 p.m.
It is a Saturday night, and it is raining—two factors counting against attendance at the talk co-hosted by Harvard’s Asian American Brotherhood and Black Men’s Forum. But a surprising number of people have filtered through the double doors of Boylston Hall, filling the plush red chairs only vaguely oriented around an old-fashioned projector. Stragglers lean against the shade-less windows, their elbows forming perpendicular angles with the droplets pounding on the other side.
Really, it’s no surprise that neither weather nor the opportunity cost of missed social engagements has deterred the audience; the talk centers on the buzz-worthy issue of affirmative action. Both campus groups have invited an alumnus who’s an expert on the issue for two short presentations, to be followed by a Q&A.
Gregory D. Kristof ’15, the education and politics director of AAB, a campus organization whose mission statement cites dedication to brotherhood, service, and activism, introduces AAB’s alumnus. Kristof focuses on the third part of AAB’s mission—the group’s discussions of discrimination and race-relations.
“We can only make so much progress if we only discuss these issues among AAB—among Asian Americans,” he says. 
As discussions about race and inclusiveness have moved to the forefront of campus life with the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign, many Asian American student organizations have launched their own dialogues about issues pertinent to their community. But the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community at Harvard—representing around 24 percent of the school’s population—encompasses individuals of dozens of different national, ethnic, linguistic, socioeconomic, and religious identities. It includes students born here and students born in Asia, biracial students and multiracial students. How can a unified political force emerge from such a diverse and multifaceted population? Is this even a goal to aspire to?
Since last semester, Harvard’s AAPI community has seen the organization of a town hall meeting for the discussion of Asian American causes, the revival of multinational groups like the Asian American Women’s Association, and an emerging social network of students exploring pan-Asian and Pacific Islander identity.
At the same time, student groups continue to foster communities around unique national identities, while individual students determine whether and how to define themselves within a broader ethnic and cultural framework. While last year’s “I, Too, Am Harvard” focused on identity and belongingness on a multiracial campus, Harvard’s AAPI students will also examine these concepts within the context of their own community.
‘Who is Asian American and where is Asia America?’
It’s difficult to align an ethnicity with a continent large enough to be divided into five distinct regions—central, south, southeast, east, and west—and 48 countries. “Asian” citizens of the United States hail from all parts of the continent; U.S. Census data counts the 3.8 million Chinese Americans as America’s largest Asian population. Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, and Korean Americans account for 3.4, 3.1, 1.7, and 1.7 million U.S. citizens, respectively.
Though the Harvard College Admissions Office does not provide a demographic breakdown of the proportion of the Class of 2018 that identifies as Asian American, a quick glance at the official list of student organizations reveals groups representing China, Hong Kong, Iran, Hawaii, Japan, Korea, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
“We have to ask, who is Asian American, and where is Asia America?’” says H. Blessing Jee ’17, who revitalized the multinational Asian American Women’s Association with Bernadette N. Lim ’16 and Nu Xiong '17 last semester.
According to Anthropology professor Christine R. Yano, the term “Asian American” only came about in the 1970s. “It seems strange that it’s thought of as one category. If you talked to people from, say, Japan, and said their alignment is supposed to be with South Asians, they would vehemently protest,” she said.
Whether because East Asians are the largest or the most affluent Asian demographic in the United States, popular “Asian American” representations tend to depict individuals of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean—but not say, Indian or Malaysian— descent. For non-East Asian Harvard students, this can make being identified within a broader “Asian American” category difficult.
“There have been moments on campus when I’ve said ‘As an Asian…’ and people said ‘But you’re not Asian,’” says Eman Riaz Ahmed ’16, co-president of the Pakistan Student Association. “Um, yes, I’m South Asian. I’m not sure why Indian and Asian American and South Asian are not the same thing in people’s heads.” 
When it comes to cross-organizational efforts, collaborations have tended to follow regional lines. “The obvious collaborations are between us and the Pakistan Student Association,” says Jane Jacob ’16, co-president of the South Asian Association. “Then the Chinese Students Association and the Korean Association. That’s something we wanted to talk about [at a town hall for AAPI students] last year—why that’s happening.”
Many students remain unsure as to how to define their own identities. “Sometimes I think of myself as Asian, but sometimes I don’t,” said Jacob. “When I see an Asian collaboration happening, do I automatically think that we should be included? Not necessarily.”
“Asian American” identities are further complicated by biracial and multiracial heritages. Harvard’s Half Asian People’s Association holds an annual discussion called “So What Are You Anyway?” “When we get together, people always ask, ‘Do you feel more Asian or more white?’” says outgoing HAPA president Allison W. Giebisch ’16, who is of half-Austrian and half-Chinese descent. “When I go to China, people don’t think I’m Chinese. In the U.S., people don’t think I’m American.”
And what about the “American” in “Asian American?” Many students born and raised in Asia also identify as Asian American, like Crimson news editor Michelle Denise L. Ferreol ’15, an international student from the Philippines and former president of the Harvard Philippine Forum. Ferreol notes the presence of cultural differences between those raised here and those raised in the Philippines. “There’s a divide between national Filipinos and American Filipinos that exists and is obvious from the get-go, but that doesn’t mean the divide is unbreakable.”
Harvard Asian American Alumni Association president Bill Yao ’90 says that his organization recently decided to include Asian-born alums, with the philosophy that anyone can self-identify as “Asian American.”
Getting Involved
Whether and however students define their identities, the decision to actively participate in Harvard’s AAPI community—particularly by joining an official student organization—is not always an obvious one.
Jee, who got involved with AAWA during her freshman spring, was initially hesitant to align herself with an official group: “Coming in to Harvard, I was literally split—one [part] of me thought I was going to embrace my roots, as cheesy as that sounds, and the other side wanted to do whatever I wanted absent of race. [It wasn’t until] second semester [that] I really started to find a community there.”
Qasim Khan ’16, Ahmed’s co-president of the Pakistan Student Association, initially feared that as an international student, joining a cultural organization could alienate him from the broader student body. “You don’t want to come to Harvard and have the first thing you do be make a clique,” he said. “That’s the worst thing you can do in a place like this.”
For others, AAPI cultural organizations provided a much-needed sense of community. Sherry Z. Liu ’16 joined the Organization of Asian American Sisters in Service (OAASIS) after talking to a fellow Asian American member of the varsity swim team, which was mostly white at the time, about wanting to discuss her cultural and racial identity with students who might better understand her perspective.“Sometimes when I talk about how my parents do things in a certain way, I feel as if people outside of the Asian identity might view that as a novelty or a source of humor. That weirded me out, when I realized those people were kind of laughing at me—because the whole thing was so foreign to them,” she explained.
After attending one of the organization’s “edu-pols,” group discussions about Asian American issues, during the recruitment process, Liu felt that she had finally found a safe space to discuss serious issues: “It was the first time I was with people openly talking about their identities. There was no joking, no passing comments about how ‘Asian’ we were…[it was] something to be taken seriously and meaningfully.”
Jee said that, despite her initial hesitation, becoming involved with AAWA “filled some kind of hole that was empty first semester.”
Socializing and Social Justice
For students who do choose to become active participants in Harvard’s official AAPI community, organized efforts might include social, cultural, service-oriented, or activist activities.
While some organizations, like AAB and OAASIS, include activism and/or political outreach among their founding pillars, other groups, like the South Asian Association, have recently made an effort to develop their emphasis beyond community-building in an effort to draw in new members and engage in serious campus discussions.
When it comes to cross-organizational collaborations, there are several long-standing intergroup traditions centered on culture and socializing. The Chinese Students Association, for instance, collaborates with other AAPI groups on events like the Crush party, the Moon Cake Study Break, and the Utopia boat party.
Activism-oriented collaborations, while on the rise, might be more difficult to foster. From a historical perspective, Yano noted, “being a politicized group is something that’s quite foreign [to the Asian American community]…Asians haven’t been known to agitate.”
Some students said that the pervasive nature of the model minority myth—the idea that Asian Americans compose a nearly uniformly successful ethnic group and therefore do not suffer from discrimination—could make it difficult to call attention to Asian American political causes.
“Yes, there will never be an Asian Michael Brown, and it’s hard to rally the community every couple months when someone makes an offensive t-shirt,” says Crimson arts editor Alan R. Xie ’16, referencing a t-shirt a student made for the popular course ER18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory,” which featured a stereotypical image of a Chinese man. “But these issues do crop up. They’re important opportunities for students and administration to discuss how stereotypes trivialize identity."
Yet, Xie noted, Asian American activism itself is often trivialized. “I was talking to a friend last year about ‘I, Too, Am Harvard,’” Xie recalls. “He said, ‘If you tried to do that, they would laugh at you the way they laughed at Occupy Harvard.’ He thought it was ironic that Asians, who don’t appear to suffer from any type of discrimination, should protest.”
Some students have found it necessary to speak out. “You’ll have different opinions [on combating stereotypes] within the Asian American community,” says Peggy Su ’13, former president of the CSA. “My tendency is to be proactive and outspoken.”
Su reached out to the Asian American Association three years ago, after a number of Chinese American students expressed concerns to her about an annual Chinese New Year Party hosted by the Spee Club. According to Su, the party’s decorations included a blow-up stereotypical Asian man and a room filled with pillows and dim lighting called “the opium den.”
Along with the AAA leadership, Su met with the club’s president. “At the time, I thought it was a very productive meeting. It was helpful for us to educate them on the implications of those decorations—opium marks a really dark period in Chinese history, and a lot of oppression. They told us they hadn’t realized the decorations were offensive until we talked.”
Though Su later heard that the Spee continued to decorate the party as in previous years, though not explicitly labeling the pillowed-room “the opium den,” the incident made her realize that joining forces with other Asian American groups and opening broader campus discussions could be an effective tool for change.
“When I see something [like the party] my first feeling is shock. The second feeling is a desire to reach out to people,” she said.
JOINING FORCES
For now, a single galvanizing cause might remain elusive—and it seems unlikely that Asian American activism would be reduced to a single cause or a single identity. However, especially since last semester, intergroup campus efforts have found productive ways to tackle common concerns.
One such concern, mental health, inspired AAB to create a social media campaign last semester. The project involved members overlaying their Facebook profile pictures with the words “you are not alone” and the contact information for University Mental Health Services. The campaign, while started as an internal AAB effort, had resonance for Asian American students across campus, who have found that the existing taboos against speaking up about mental health issues and the costs of academic pressure are amplified by the “model minority” myth.
A webpage created by Dominick Zheng ’16, one of the campaign’s organizers, cites four events of the 2013-2014 school year as the impetus for the campaign: “In one year, one student ended up in federal court for a bomb threat. Three students died. One of them committed suicide. Two of the four students mentioned above were Asian males.”
Current CSA president Eric Z. Wang ’15 explained why the model minority myth can have detrimental effects in an environment like Harvard’s. “There are Asian students who aren’t the traditionally ‘academically gifted’ types. This is Harvard and everyone gets in for different reasons,” Wang says. “So there are Asian Americans who struggle under the pressure to achieve what people think they should be achieving. Everyone thinks ‘the Asians will do well,’ so if you’re Asian and you get a C at Harvard, that’s hard. You have to deal with other people’s expectations.”
Not only does the model minority myth create the expectation that Asian American students should always succeed academically; it stigmatizes coping with failure, according to Min-Woo S. Park ’16, who collaborated with Zheng on the social media project.
“With the model minority myth, everything’s okay, right,” says Park. “It’s not okay to be not okay.”The Asian American Brotherhood co-sponsored the campaign with OAASIS; other AAPI student groups, and Harvard students of all backgrounds, began asking Park and Zheng to overlay their profile pictures with text, too. According to Zheng’s site, the project accumulated over 3,000 likes.
This year, OAASIS plans to continue examining the issue of mental health in the Asian American community by holding discussions examining the prevalence of eating disorders for female AAPI students.
Last semester also saw a town hall meeting where leaders from all sections of Harvard’s Asian American and Pacific Islander community were invited to discuss common interests and intergroup collaboration.
Jacob had just been elected president of SAA when she attended the event: “The new leaders were trying to figure out how we could collaborate because we saw a lot of unity in the black community with “I, Too, Am Harvard” and in the Latino community, too.”
The event also attracted AAPI students who had not previously been involved in activism or campus organizations. “It wasn’t just people who had gone to [official group] meetings, but people who heard about it through friends,” said Jee.
Some students wanted to see such collaborative discussions continue. An e-mail thread suggesting weekly meetings in which students might discuss pan-AAPI identity began to circulate. “The idea was just to talk about our feelings about ‘I, Too, Am Harvard,’ the needs of AAPI students on campus, and the need for racial organizing. It was a cool brain meld place to talk about what our various organizations were doing,” says Ivy Z. Yan ’15.
Though Yan emphasized that the discussion forum did not need to become an organized group, conversations about pan-AAPI identity did inspire the revitalization of the Asian American Women’s Association.
Jee felt that the group provided a certain sense of community and solidarity. “I don’t know if it was meant to address a certain lack or fragmentation in the [AAPI] community, but for me—I just wanted something more. That something more became AAWA.”
Meanwhile, students interested in pan-AAPI identity have begun brainstorming projects for the 2014-2015 school year. According to Yan, some students have been putting together an online “AAPI Guide to Harvard and Life” that provides resources specific to the AAPI community, like AAPI professors’ contact information and service/advocacy opportunities. She also mentioned plans to organize a second town hall event in the fall.
As students continue to meet in such broad forums, the diversity of the Asian American community will no doubt be a topic of discussion. Existing multinational groups like OAASIS often have discussions about the diverse perspectives of their members.
During a group talk on one of OAASIS’s semesterly weekend retreats, a Japanese member spoke about growing up listening to her grandfather’s stories about escaping from North Korea. The story prompted discussion about historical tensions between Asian nationalities, and how members’ backgrounds affect their views of family and life.
Liu says that she has found personal sharing to be the most effective tool in bridging cultural boundaries within her organization.
“It struck me how ingrained in history [the member’s] tale was,” says Liu. “The more you share about your personal experiences, the more you see who you currently are.” Safe Spaces, In School and After School
For the discussions necessary for bringing together a diverse and multifaceted community, many AAPI activists seek a specific office or other location on campus, according to Jee. The leaders of “I, Too, Am Harvard” and Latino student groups have also called for physical spaces for their communities.
While Harvard’s “Community Conversations,” are meant to prompt discussions of race relations on campus, the infrequency of the event and the size of the discussions can create roadblocks—Community Conversations are only held once a year for freshman entryways, which typically consist of 20-40 students each.
“One meeting to figure out diversity and respecting each other is not enough, ” said Yan, who helped facilitate a conversation this year.
Jee also said that many AAPI students would benefit from the presence of an AAPI race tutor in every House, as well as an increase in AAPI faculty members and Asian American studies courses.
The Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance discussed the creation of an Asian American studies department with administrators a few years ago; though no Asian American studies department was created, HAAAA eventually helped establish the creation of an “Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights” field that would incorporate Asian American along with Latino and Native American topics. Harvard’s English Department has also recently hired Professor Ju Yon Kim, who specializes in Asian American literature.
“It can be unsettling, maybe a little isolating when you can’t see administrators or faculty of your culture,” said Neal K.A. Akatsuka, a social anthropology A.M. who co-chairs the Harvard Association of Asian and Asian American Faculty and Staff. HAAAF which is in the planning stages of creating a student-mentorship program.
According to Jee, the search for safe spaces, Asian American studies courses, and faculty representation all share one end—the fostering of discussions about Harvard’s AAPI community and campus race relations. “In general, the idea of having conversations is so radical,” she says. “’Hey, how do you feel about being an Asian person on campus?’ is such a radical step.”

On Sept. 18th, David Mitchell, acclaimed author of such works as “Cloud Atlas” and “The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet,” visited Cambridge to talk about his new book, “The Bone Clocks.” After more than an hour of book-signing and joking with fans, Fifteen Minutes sat down to a late-night dinner with the English author.
FM: Your novels are each so different—you’ve written about everything from Neo-Seoul to Dejima to gang wars and disembodied spirits. Everything seems believable, though—how do you make each novel feel so real?
DM: Well, I make them believable by not messing them up. I make them internally consistent, so that the reader never says, “Hang on! You said it works like this here, but over here you said it works like that!” With futuristic made-up worlds, I write the constitution of the place, the laws about how it works. The actual laws, maybe, but also, the unspoken ones.  Who’s got the power? What do people in that world take for granted? You get it fixed in your head how the place works, and then you use what is in all readers—the default mode is that we will believe. The narrative will convince us, just as long as you don’t mess it up.
FM: I’d like to ask about a recent, not-too-favorable review in the New Yorker that said your book was beautiful but lacking in substance. How do you respond to that?
DM: I basically don’t think about it anymore. I’d prefer the review to be good—I’d like all of them to be good—but that isn’t gonna happen. I don’t write books for reviewers, and I think today you cannot write a book with one eye on future reviews. You’d just be left with this anodyne, safe thing in the late Henry James tradition, and that’s too confining for me.
FM: Can you explain what you mean by “safe” writing?
DM: It means writing about a world that you know and don’t need to research, not finding out about the lives of people radically different to yours. It means not messing with structure—just a past tense, third person narrative—it goes through, no tricks, no jumping around. It means not using genre at all.
It means, for me, writing a novel about a middle class, North London couple who are having marital difficulties. One of them has an affair, goes off, and there are unforeseen consequences that are a little bit foreseen, really. They divorce, go their different ways, decide they can’t live without each other, forgive each other, and—on the cusp of reconciliation—one gets tragically killed. That would be, for me, a very safe novel. I could write it in my sleep. It would be okay, but really, why bother? That’s what I mean by a safe novel.
FM: In your books, there are ideas that appear again and again—everything is connected, the strong eat the weak, something about never knowing whom to trust. Do you put those ideas in because you believe them? Because you disagree with them? Do they just manage to sneak in anyhow?
DM: They all sneak their way in, because they are my archetypal themes. Another one you didn’t mention is impaired communication. All writers have a number of archetypal themes. It’s not so much about what they put in their books—it’s about what the writer’s made of. Even if you tried to keep them out, they’ll sneak in. As it happens, they’re fairly beefy themes, so I’m happy to usher them in.
FM: What about the repeating characters—is that something you’ve planned from the beginning? Do you always know when you’ll use your next character?
DM: Mostly it’s book-by-book proposal. I think of the book first, and then, quite early, I think if there’s anyone who I can reemploy. I reacquaint myself with them and their histories, and if they fit—if there’s not too many of them—then yes, I will redeploy them.
FM: Where do you take your inspiration from?
DM: Inspiration’s a bit of a myth. I think it’s a highfalutin way of saying, “Keep your eyes open, your ears open. Don’t interrupt, and help yourself to ideas that the world is made of.” What is called inspiration is just everywhere–everything, potentially, is a story. The idea that inspiration is an ideas fairy who can only be hunted out in rare, arcane places by those special people–I don’t buy that.
FM: So for someone who can potentially write about anything, how do you narrow down your list?
DM: Human frailty. I can only write so many books. I’ve already got five ideas lined up, and I don’t let any new ones in, really. I’ll still write ideas down, because they might be ideas for scenes.  Those are still very welcome, and observations are still very welcome. The name Mayer, which I haven’t really met before, will go into my name bank page, because it’s a cool name. I can’t think it up; I can only find it. There was another great one tonight—Marena.
FM: Can you give us any hints into plans for future books?
DM: I’m doing a short book—my first ever short book—that will give a home to some stories that I wrote for an early version of “The Bone Clocks.” After that, I’ll be thinking about the late sixties and the musical creativity in SoHo, London, and Greenwich Village. It will be about popular culture at the time, and art and youth and music and politics.... I’ll be honing in and peopling a world that was real, but is now gone. I might have 119A, though, the Horologists’ safe house, as the scene of a party or something. I’ll see.
FM: You’ve said that one of the hardest things is getting rid of a piece of beautiful writing that really doesn’t fit in your books. Are there any examples you can tell us about?
DM: There are loads, and if I had my laptop here, I would show you. To make it easier, to excise them, you don’t put them in a trashcan. You open a file called “The Useful Bin” and put everything in there. It makes it much easier, because you’re not losing it, and if you want to get it back, it will always be there.
But you know what? You never, never go in there ever again. You forget it even exists. I don’t even know what it was that I agonized over for so long, because it’s just gone now. I’m not trying to be deliberately secretive—it’s part of the process. You forget, because it wasn’t needed. The moment they’ve gone, amnesia settles in.
FM: Watching you at the event tonight, you seemed so energetic; it was really astounding. I have to ask, where do you get all this energy from?
DM: Well, from you—from the audience. I’m not like that normally, but when I have an attentive audience, then I feel as if I’m participating in a think tank—swimming in a think tank. There’s intelligence and thought and wit and responsiveness, and these things set up a kind of feedback loop with me—perhaps I become more intelligent and more attentive and wittier than I’d otherwise be.
FM: And when you go back to write, does that energy stay with you then?
DM: That’s a different kind of energy. It’s not performance energy—it’s work energy, I suppose. Energy for writing comes from what you’re writing. In a way the work in progress becomes the audience. You get energy from a well-crafted sentence, a neat idea, or a snappy exchange of dialogue. You get energy from right decisions as you create a scene and place those scenes end to end. Sometimes you read other things, or watch the way that six plots are simultaneously spun in Game of Thrones, and think “Wow, that’s really clever.” The way the protagonist in Breaking Bad, Walter, is often a really objectionable person. He’s half hero, half anti-hero—that’s clever! Or, I come across a new word, like “dilatory.” That wasn’t in my active vocabulary, but it is now. Dilatoriness—the noun’s even nicer in a way. It’s clumsier, but nicer. So yeah, this is where energy comes from. That and food, so don’t eat gloop in your canteen, and remember to get your vegetables.

Enjoying the improved dining hall menu this year? You can thank Pankaj Pradhan, the culinary artist behind The Red Lentil, a vegan and vegetarian restaurant in Watertown, Mass. This Summer, he shared his talents with Harvard University Dining Services to bring more flavor and variety to the dining halls. FM sat down with Pradhan for five questions about the collaboration. 
1Fifteen Minutes: What was it about this project that caught your interest?Pankaj Pradhan: I grew up as a vegetarian. I believe in sharing my knowledge. I believe in healthy food. I believe in the new and upcoming generation. This country is leaning towards more unhealthy junk food, so for me, being a part of bringing the healthy food, bringing more environmentally conscious cuisine, things like that, I really get a lot of pride out of that.
2FM: You were able to sample a dining hall meal when you first decided to work with HUDS. How would you describe the quality of the vegetarian cusine pre-collaboration?PP: The quality was excellent. There was no talk about the quality. As far as choices go…I don’t think they had too many choices. Maybe that’s why they hired me: to introduce more choices and more flavor.
3 FM: Can you find similar items to the ones you created for HUDS at The Red Lentil restaurant?PP: Some of them, like shepherd's pie, yes, but when I did the menu for Harvard dining services, I had to consider a couple other things. [When making] the recipes I considered the volume…[being] cost effective…and [seasonal] availability… Those [were] the three main things on my mind when I was working on the menu. And I wanted it to be quicker… for HUDS to do something for 6,000 to 7,000 [people they] can’t do a la carte style. They have to be more efficient. 
4FM: Do you have a favorite dish out of the creations you put together for HUDS?PP: [With] any dishes I make for Harvard or for my restaurant, I don’t pick a favorite because the moment you start making a favorite it becomes harder to [have] focus and dedication on each and every individual recipe. I can tell you what’s popular, but not my favorite.
4.5FM: So, what’s popular?PP: Shepard’s pie is a great dish, and it’s very popular! If you are in the transition period [between] being a meat eater and trying vegetarianism, I would say shepherd's pie plays a role of transitioning people who are trying to convert.
5FM: How was the experience working with HUDS?PP: Everybody was helpful. I did not have any bad experiences. [The] people are very pleasant. The chefs are very down to earth. I had a great time. They were very helpful to me. I do not have anything bad to say about it. It was a great experience.

UPDATED: September 24, 2014, at 6:40 p.m.
Stephen Blyth will be the next president and chief executive officer of Harvard Management Company, the University’s investment arm which manages its $36 billion endowment.
Blyth, who is currently a managing director and head of public markets at HMC as well as a professor of statistics, will assume the role Jan. 1, 2015. He will manage the largest university endowment in the world, which, as reported yesterday in HMC’s annual report, currently sits at $36.4 billion.
He will succeed Jane L. Mendillo, who announced in June her decision to end her eight-year tenure at the helm of HMC.
University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75, a member of the Harvard Corporation and of the search committee that picked Blyth, said in an interview Wednesday afternoon that the search committee “had a very strong pool, and Stephen rose to the top.”
“Stephen is a terrific candidate, and we’re delighted with the opportunity he now presents,” Finnegan said. He would not say when the appointment was finalized and directed further questions to the University’s press release. The Corporation met on Monday for a regularly monthly meeting with Mendillo in attendance.
The search for Mendillo’s replacement was led by James F. Rothenberg ’68, Harvard’s treasurer from 2004 until earlier this year and the current chairman of HMC’s board. Rothenberg said last week that the list of candidates was short at that point, but he declined to give further specifics. Other HMC board members participated in the search, according to Finnegan, but Mendillo said that she herself did not.
Blyth joined HMC in 2006 upon leaving Deutsche Bank, where he served as managing director and head of its global rates proprietary group in London. Before that, he was a managing director of Morgan Stanley’s interest-rate group in New York.
In his role as head of public markets, Blyth has overseen the fixed income and public equities asset classes, which approximately totals 43 percent of HMC’s portfolio, according to the annual report.
Fixed income in particular has historically been a strong driver of growth for the HMC’s portfolio, with an annualized return over the past 20 years of around 11 percent, more than 4 percentage points above its internal benchmark. It surpassed its benchmark this year by 3.5 percentage points.
Blyth said in an interview on Wednesday that HMC’s aim for creative and innovative investments is a strategy that spans all asset classes.
“The most important thing is for HMC as an institution to be in the position to exploit opportunities as they arise,” he said. “Market opportunities always evolve, and we just need to be appropriately positioned and staffed so we can identify and exploit those opportunities as they arise in whichever areas of the markets they may arise.”
In the past year, HMC has experienced a string of departures of top-level investors, including managing directors in private equity and fixed income. Blyth acknowledged that strong investors would inevitably receive opportunities elsewhere but said that he believes that HMC has unique draw as an employer.
“At heart people believe in the mission of HMC and that is an incredibly strong attraction for people to come and work here,” Blyth said. “I’m bullish on our ability to continue to build a great team.”
Blyth is set to lead HMC following several years when its returns have lagged behind many of Harvard’s peer institutions. But on Wednesday, Blyth stressed that HMC’s returns have exceeded its internal benchmarks and, he said, served Harvard’s needs.
“HMC has a singular aim, which is to support the operations of the University and to maintain most of the endowment for future generations,” he said. “Our five-year return is 11.6 percent and has beaten [the internal] benchmark every year, so I feel good about the performance of the endowment over the long run.”
Blyth also holds a Ph. D. from Harvard in statistics. As a professor, he has taught Statistics 123: “Applied Quantitative Finance,” a popular undergraduate course within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, since 2009, and was awarded the Alpha Iota Prize for Excellence in Teaching in 2013. He was also a resident tutor in Winthrop House while he was a doctoral student at the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second time was the charm in finding a new name for the resident deans of Harvard’s Houses.
Resident deans—the administrators briefly known as House deans—will now be called Allston Burr Assistant Deans of Harvard College, according to several College administrators. The resident dean of Adams House, for example, is now officially “Assistant Dean of Harvard College, Adams House.”
The deans of the four freshman yards will continue to be called “resident deans,” but they will also gain the title of assistant dean of the College, according to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde.
This summer, former Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister changed the name of the upperclassman resident dean position to “House dean.” The decision followed a set of internal recommendations made by a Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee charged with reviewing the resident dean position and its role within the College administration.
But concerns about the “House dean” title’s connotation prompted the most recent name change, according to Lassonde.
The deans wanted a job title that was “comprehensible to people outside the University who see their titles and then can infer something about their roles,” Lassonde said. He said the deans felt that both the “resident” and “House” variations of the title did not sufficiently signal the job’s academic responsibilities.
The name change was approved earlier this month, Lassonde said. The deans’ responsibilities have not changed, however.
Several other administrators, including the interim secretary of the Administrative Board and the director of advising programs, are similarly titled assistant deans of the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Days ahead of a planned sit-down with University administrators, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers released a report on Wednesday afternoon that offers suggestions for lowering annual healthcare costs for all Harvard employees.
The report, entitled “Seven Good Ideas for Bending the Health Care Cost Curve,” proposes solutions to mitigate the cost burden on employees as healthcare costs soar nationwide, including at Harvard. It was released just weeks after the University made public an overhaul of its health benefits plans for nonunion employees and at a time when healthcare negotiations between the union and the University remain stalled.
The union’s nearly 4,800 members were not among those affected by the early September health plan changes, which included cuts to premiums and the introduction of deductibles.
If completely implemented, the union estimates the measures proposed in the report could save the University between five and six million dollars per year without meaningfully affecting coverage. Those savings, if adopted, would come as administrators have said healthcare costs are consuming a larger proportion of the University’s budget, currently estimated at 12 percent by Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann.
HUCTW’s report presents what the union thinks are the best options for University-wide healthcare policy reform. Based on a year of research by union leaders, the report lays out short-, medium-, and long-term cost-cutting options from promoting the use of mail-order prescriptions to increased investment in “condition management” to transformations in the conventional model for primary care.
HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said he hopes the University will be receptive to the ideas.
“We’re interested in the idea that there are different kinds of strategies available for controlling the cost of healthcare,” Jaeger said. “We’re really trying to provoke the conversation and ask the whole community to engage with the question of what are really progressive, innovative ways to try to be part of the solution.”
Harvard and representatives of the union—the University’s largest labor organization—will begin meeting on Friday to discuss the recently announced health benefits plans as well as other issues concerning the cost of healthcare, according to Harvard Labor Relations Director Bill Murphy.
“It is our expectation that all participants in this discussion will come to the table with their best ideas,” Murphy wrote in an email. “Any analysis of specific ideas at this point, however, would be premature."
Jaeger said that union members have been enthusiastic about the cost-cutting ideas outlined in the report, which he hopes could help cut costs for both union and nonunion employees.
“We’re ever-optimistic,” said HUCTW organizer Donene M. Williams, who helped write the report. “The more people that are interested in [healthcare policy], the more likely it is that something new or creative might happen.”
Jaeger added, “the conversation is just getting started in the union but already on our phone lines and in our email there are a lot of stories and observations from our members about how these ideas might better their lives.”
Healthcare negotiations between the University and HUCTW have been stalled since September 2013 when the parties failed to reach an agreement on the health benefits. A larger earlier 2013 contract had also failed to reach a resolution on the topic. As a result, union members’ benefits plans have not changed in the last four years, according to Williams.
The Friday meeting—which will include Jaeger, Williams, Murphy, Hausammann, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, Director of Benefits and Human Resources Systems Rita Moore, and several faculty members—marks the first time in over a year that union leaders have met with central administrators, Williams said.
“We’ve had a number of proposals back and forth with each other that have been stalled, and we have ongoing healthcare negotiations that aren’t going anywhere,” Williams said. “I would not consider [the meeting] a re-opening of negotiations, but do think it’s better to meet and talk than not talking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester, students have grown accustomed to the sight of Luke A. Leafgren, resident dean of Mather House, perching his homespun portable desk on the tables of the Mather dining hall, standing as he works. For now, Leafgren’s invention, a standing desk, is only elevating the laptops of a select few, but a Kickstarter campaign he started to finance its large-scale production has raised over $23,000 in about four weeks.
The StandStand, as Leafgren calls the wooden structure, is a portable set of three interlocking panels, easy to assemble and disassemble.
After reading several studies warning of the health dangers linked to sitting too much, Leafgren began looking for ways to stand as often as possible. The idea for the StandStand, he said, “came to me one morning when I was sitting down for a meditation session.”
The StandStand went through several different phases before reaching its current model, which Leafgren perfected during a week at home this summer. Working in a high school friend’s cabinetry shop, he hammered out the final design.
“It was a really fun creative puzzle to think about, what would work, what would solve various problems,” he said.
The current prototype weighs only about two pounds and easily fits into a backpack, though it can support over 900 pounds, according to Leafgren. Its portability and affordability—the birch model comes to $50, while the bamboo totals $90—make it an appealing option over most stationary standing desks, which can cost several hundred dollars. There are currently three models available in different heights.
Leafgren said he spoke to several students as his idea was developing and cited the entrepreneurial spirit at Harvard as one of his influences.
“What I like is, it’s an additional way to connect with students,” he said. “So many people at Harvard are interested in innovation, interested in startups, interested in designing things, and I’m sure that was part of the inspiration for me to think I could try doing something, but it’s also given me a greater appreciation for what the students are doing.”
To help produce multimedia content for the campaign, Leafgren enlisted the help of Lance B. Katigbak ’16.
Katigbak helped polish a video script, shot and directed a video, and took some photographs of Leafgren using the StandStand around Harvard Square.
“I thought it was brilliant,” Katigbak said. “[Leafgren] talked me through the problems, he showed me the evolution, and that to me was an example of a really good design that doesn’t just look cool, but it’s also super functional and super useful.”
Alexander A. Wirth ’15, a student in Mather House who first heard of Leafgren’s idea last spring, has been using a StandStand for the past two weeks and says that he has “really enjoyed it so far,” noting the increased amount of energy he has when he works while standing.
“It’s really exciting to see our administrators taking on entrepreneurship like this,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A European study into the origins of the universe is shedding light and raising questions on data first gathered through a Harvard telescope at the South Pole and unveiled this past spring.
At a panel discussion in March, a team of Harvard researchers led by associate professor of Astronomy John M. Kovac shared evidence of “cosmic inflation,” the expansion of the universe after the Big Bang. The data—which was collected over three years and analyzed over four—indicated that a gravitational repulsion caused the universe’s exponential expansion.
But findings from the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite suggest that the data collected by Harvard’s telescope, BICEP2, did not completely account for galactic dust.
“What Planck did was they basically said the level of polarized dust emission in the BICEP2 region was...higher than anybody thought it was beforehand,” said Kirit S. Karkare, an astronomy graduate student who is working on the Harvard research team.
These findings have raised some questions in the scientific community about the previous claims made by the Harvard team, although many of the implications are still undetermined.
“The models of polarized dust in our galaxy are pretty uncertain actually,” Kovac said. “If they’re all underestimates, there is a possibility the entire signal device which we measured with very high precision could be explained by galactic polarized dust.”
The Planck data, which will be published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, delves more deeply into the polarization patterns of the galactic dust.
“The issue is there’s a particular signature in the cosmic background,” said Marc Kamionkowski, a physicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not a member of the Harvard team but participated in the March panel. “There is dust in the galaxy that emits polarized light that may mimic the cosmic signal.”
The BICEP2 and Planck teams have both taken data from the dust distribution, and Kamionkowski said that researchers need to proceed carefully.
“[There is] a lot more in the data that has not been taken advantage of, and we should be waiting for more careful analysis,” Kamionkowski said.
As the project moves forward, the groups plan to collaborate on their mapping technologies. They will study the signals that are detected by both technologies and could be attributed to dust, Kovac said.
“What’s really remarkable is that all of these experiments basically are looking for extremely, extremely faint signals,” Karkare said. These signals exist as photons and can be observed by telescopes like BICEP2 and its predecessors, BICEP1 and Keck Array.
“Seeing the difference between a billion and a billion and one of these photons is fantastically difficult to do,” Karkare said.
Over the next several months, Harvard researchers and collaborators will also be developing a new telescope, BICEP3.
“Knowledge gets refined as we add more and more data,” Kovac said. He explained that while the public sphere may latch onto and generate headlines, the team’s focus is to clarify the uncertainties.
“What we’ve learned this year is that this is nothing if not very exciting science,” Kovac said. “Whatever the level of dust, the experiment was wildly successful in achieving breakthrough sensitivity. It is our goal to take that same approach and to apply it to a wider swath of sky—hopefully the whole sky.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Sept. 25, 2014, at 12:06 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust and her Stanford counterpart John L. Hennessy partnered to write a rare op-ed piece, published Tuesday by The Huffington Post, that emphasized the research role universities play in the fight to combat climate change.
Without directly addressing the question of divestment, Faust and Hennessy acknowledged the students on their campuses who have joined the global climate conversation and wrote that their schools’ contributions to combating climate change will come through education and research.
Students across the country, including those in Palo Alto and Cambridge, have called on institutions of higher education to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies.
Faust has been adamant that divestment is not “warranted or wise,” writing in an open letter last year that “the endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.” Hennessy's Stanford, on the other hand, recently divested the university's endowment from approximately 100 companies engaged in coal extraction.
In the latest piece, Hennessy and Faust emphasized the role of academic research in combating climate change. “University scientists play crucial roles in investigating the origins and trajectory of climate change, in gauging its present and prospective consequences and in devising the new technologies that will accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources,” they wrote.
Faust and Hennessy added that universities need to accelerate their efforts in research and education. “We in higher education must continue to step up, as well,” they wrote.
The presidents then highlighted the work being done at their respective schools to adjust to and address climate change.
Mirroring Faust’s other public statements on divestment, the letter drew attention to a 21 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on Harvard’s campus. The piece also mentioned a new partnership between Harvard, other local schools, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in developing the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center.
“Universities must ‘walk the walk,’ acting as pioneers in embracing the new technologies and policies that will be needed to sustain our ecosystem,” Hennessy and Faust wrote. “Universities must use these inherent strengths to make the most potent possible contribution on climate change.... Whether we rise to that challenge, with the urgency it demands, will largely determine what sort of world we leave for the generations to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-2) wrapped up its non-conference schedule with a win at Lundholm Gymnasium against the New Hampshire Wildcats (6-10). This victory marked a five-game win streak for the Crimson, as Harvard gets ready to start conference play in the Ivy League.
The Crimson was in danger of falling behind two sets to one. The team faced a 20-18 deficit in the third set after an attack error by Harvard sophomore Corie Bain and a service ace by New Hampshire’s sophomore Maggie Kenney.
However, the Crimson rattled off seven straight points to steal the third set by a score of 25-20. Sophomore Grace Weghorst played an instrumental role in this strong push by Harvard with four kills in the final six points of the set.
"Each game is a learning experience," Weghorst said. "Everyone knows their role [now]. We’re ready to go."
After the closely contended third set, the Crimson did not let New Hampshire back into the match. In the deciding fourth set, Harvard was able to keep the Wildcats at a safe distance, finishing off the match with a 25-16 victory in the final set.
The Crimson streaked to an early 12-3 lead. Although the Wildcats would close the gap to five at 18-13, Harvard finished strong. A kill by co-captain Caroline Walters from junior Hannah Schmidt proved to be the decisive point in the match.
"We did a good job going to a foreign environment and getting a win," Bain said.
Harvard did not waste any time easing into the match, winning the first set by a commanding score of 25-14. The Crimson played a very clean first set, only committing two errors compared to the Wildcats’ eight.
However, Harvard was not able to take the two-set lead, as New Hampshire came out stronger in the second frame. Coming off a solid performance in the Holly Young Invitational, the Wildcats managed to take the second set by a score of 25-22. But the Crimson would go on to regain the momentum and extend its win streak.
"The team played well," Weghorst said. "We came out and fought coming out in the first game. We lulled and played point for point in the second set which allowed them to come back into the match and tie it at one. But then we went back to playing our game and put it away."
Bain would lead the Crimson attack on the night. Last year’s unanimous Ivy League Rookie of the Year, Bain would go on to record a team high 13 kills, 18 digs, and 26 assists–good for her eighth triple-double of the year.
The Crimson also benefitted from a balanced attack on Wednesday night. Weghorst followed closely behind Bain with 12 kills of her own. Walters and junior Jennifer Shults each added eight kills.
Part of Harvard’s success rested upon its ability to play a clean game. The Crimson had a combined 14 errors on the night, seven of which the team committed in the second set, which Harvard would go on to lose.
After tonight’s victory, the Crimson is looking forward to Ivy League play and its first conference game against another New Hampshire based team, Dartmouth (9-2). Harvard has picked up strong wins against tough opponents throughout its non-conference slate.
The Crimson opened its 2014 campaign with a come-from-behind victory over then-undefeated Santa Clara. Harvard then added a staight-set win against Central Connecticut State to its record, before dropping back-to-back contests against Delaware and North Carolina State.
But following the two losses, the Crimson has shown no signs of slowing down with its five-straigh victories against non-conference foes.
The team hopes to carry the momentum that it has gained in non-conference play into contests against the Ancient Eight and improve on last year’s second place finish in the conference.
"I’m really confident about the team as we head into the Ivies," Bain said. "We are running a good offensive system and our defense is looking great. With this team, we’re all really good friends and the bonds are spectacular. But going into conference play there’s so many emotional ties in the Ivy League, which make things unpredictable, but I have confidence in this team to take care of business."

The Harvard U.S. India Initiative’s “emBODYindia” campaign published its first post at midnight on Thursday, and fewer than twenty four hours later, is already attracting international attention. When I caught up with the organizers of “emBODYindia” Thursday at 12:30 p.m., they were in between phone calls with Buzzfeed India and the American version of the popular news site. Articles covering their project had already been posted on ScoopWhoop and Deccan Chronicle.
The project seeks to combat the “unwanted sexualization of women” in India, which has been the subject of a recent controversy: earlier this month, The Times of India posted pictures of a popular movie star on Twitter with the caption “OMG: Deepika Padukone’s cleavage show!” When Padukone responded with outrage, the TOI responded by publishing an op-ed accusing her of hypocrisy.
In an article titled “MY body, MY choices: #emBODYindia,” the authors, Disha Verma '15 (an inactive Crimson editor), Upasna Sharma '15, and Zeenia L. Framroze '15, criticize the TOI’s actions, and state that “this country’s voyeuristic relationship with female anatomy and femininity itself is fueled by poorly-enforced legislation, wrist-slaps instead of court cases, and an acceptance of an unequal status quo. It is a toxic, self-perpetuating relationship that needs to stop. We need to start with the fundamental premise of ownership”.
Along with the article, the group also has a photo campaign on tumblr with students holding signs in a similar fashion to the the photos used by the “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign, which drew national attention last year.
While the organizers I talked to, Verma, Aditya Agrawal ‘17, and Ayesha A. Mangaldas ‘17, were happy the campaign was attracting attention, they shared concerns about the nature of the attention.
emBODYindia currently features sixteen students and the Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana. While two of the pictures depict Verma and Mangaldas individually appearing to be topless behind signs they are holding, they very clearly state that “no one was nude. No one was topless.” The fact that this is the subject of so much attention, however, highlights the problem they are trying to expose.
“Instead of taking the campaign as a whole, the entire Indian media has picked up on ‘Oh, Harvard students go topless’,” Verma said, “Exactly what we were trying to say was ‘you shouldn’t be doing this.’”
Agrawal revealed the team will be writing a “very angry, very radical article” and that there will be a second set of photoshoots posted soon. They are also working with other school and are currently thinking about how to have an impact in India.
“As an organization in the U.S.,” Verma said, “there’s usually not much on-the-ground impact we can have, right? But where we can make an impact is in social and cultural issues and how people think about things.”
