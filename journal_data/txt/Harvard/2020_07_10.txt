After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though all courses will be virtual this fall, Harvard College expects professors to guarantee every student — regardless of time zone — between two and four hours of live interaction with course staff or peers each week, according to official College guidelines.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced Monday that all College courses would be taught virtually for students both on and off campus for the 2020-21 academic year. While most faculty also learned of the decision that day, many started to plan months ago for the possibility that the remote teaching format begun in March would extend into the fall.
Though the pandemic necessitated a hasty transition online last spring, FAS administrators have vowed to use the summer months to develop a more polished, professional virtual learning experience.
Some faculty members suggested that certain aspects of teaching may be more effective in an online format than an in-person format during a Thursday panel hosted by Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh.
History of Science professor Anne Harrington ’82 said that although students are divided into particular sections they must attend every week in a traditional course, in an online format, she can imagine dividing sections by topic and allowing students to choose which section they attend on a week-by-week basis.
Claybaugh said that while moving between modes of communication necessarily creates a transitional period, she believes people will learn to take advantage of the opportunities the new mode provides.
“As a scholar of literature, I’m interested in what happens when people move from one mode to another — so when you go from theater to film, for instance,” Claybaugh said. “For a while, what happens at these transition moments is film just sort of acts like it’s a theater. Then, at a certain point, the filmmakers realize, ‘no, actually we can do different things.’"
Still, faculty who have started to plan their fall courses must comply with several guidelines developed by the College, according to an FAS website dedicated to helping faculty prepare to teach remotely.
The requirement of providing students two to four hours of live interaction with faculty, teaching fellows, or their peers does not include watching recorded lectures, the guidelines make clear. This distinguishes College courses from online courses offered by the Harvard Extension School, for example.
In total, each student should have eight to 12 hours of engagement with each course every week under the guidelines.
For some departments, this means rethinking their usual course offerings, especially for large lecture courses.
Harrington said during Thursday’s panel discussion that she is canceling her general education survey course on the history of psychiatry in favor of a smaller course on mental health. She also said she is considering holding multiple sessions of the same class to accommodate students around the world.
In a Government Department town hall Wednesday, department administrators said they are taking a two-pronged approach. First, they plan to expand the offering of seminars, including transitioning certain lecture courses into seminars. Second, for large core courses such as Government 20: “Foundations of Comparative Politics,” they may look to create professional pre-recorded lectures similar to those on Harvard’s online education platform, HarvardX.
Claybaugh said in the panel discussion that faculty will likely be able to lecture from their campus offices rather than from home, which could address the technical issues that plagued some courses in the spring. Instructors will be able to access live tech support in the fall, she added.
Claybaugh said her “greatest worry” in extending the virtual education format was how to handle practice-based courses, such as science labs and art studio courses. Those faculty have been “unbelievably creative” in designing their courses, she said, whether by designing activities students can do at home, shipping select supplies to students, or using simulations based on data gathered by graduate students.
Physics preceptor David E. Abrams said he will likely be working “flat out” until the beginning of fall term as his department works to plan curriculums, record lectures and demonstrations, and send out materials.
Abrams said his biggest concern with the virtual format is helping students when they run into difficulties in hands-on projects.
“I teach a course where we build electronics,” he said. “The kind of mistakes that students make are not too hard to find if you can look over their shoulder, but they’re really not very easy to see through a notebook computer’s webcam.”
Some courses, however, proved too difficult to transition into a virtual format.
For example, the Physics Department will not offer Physics 191: “Advanced Laboratory,” a course normally required of Physics honors concentrators, during the 2020-21 academic year, Physics professor Howard M. Georgi announced in an email to concentrators. As a result, seniors graduating in 2020-21 will not be required to take the course for honors.
Juniors concentrating in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering can normally choose to take Engineering Sciences 96: “Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project” in fall or spring semester, but it will only be offered in the spring this year, per an email to concentrators.
History professor Maya Jasanoff — who led the FAS working group examining the long-term horizon leading up to the decision on fall format — said any changes pioneered at Harvard to respond to the pandemic are likely to have “cascading effects on higher education.”
Harvard has a history of innovation during crisis, such as developing a General Education program following World War II that many other colleges later adopted, Jasanoff said.
One point she said her working group made sure to emphasize in its recommendations, however, was that digital solutions should never fully replace Harvard’s in-person teaching and residential model.
“While the pandemic showed us where remote learning makes sense to extend, it also showed us about what’s important about in-person learning,” Jasanoff said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The hearing on a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a lawsuit filed by Harvard and MIT will take place at 3 p.m. Tuesday, Judge Allison D. Burroughs said Friday.
Citing fast-approaching deadlines from ICE on the guidelines, Burroughs agreed to an expedited timeline, but questioned whether it would be “humanly possible” for her to read thousands of potential pages of briefs and issue a ruling by Wednesday.
In the guidelines, ICE mandated that schools submit their plans for fall operations by Wednesday and update paperwork for each international student by August 4. The start of the fall semester — in which Harvard plans to hold all instruction online and allow no more than 40 percent of undergraduates to live on campus — is also imminent.
Next week, to argue for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction — which, if granted, would halt enforcement of the guidelines for the duration of the litigation — attorneys for Harvard must prove they are “likely to succeed on the merits” of the case when it is argued in full, and that there will be irreparable harm without immediate relief.
The brief from the Department of Homeland Security and ICE and amicus briefs for Harvard and MIT will be due at noon Monday, and a reply brief from Harvard and MIT will be due at noon on Tuesday.
Burroughs asked William F. “Bill” Lee ’72 — the Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation and a lawyer for Harvard and MIT on the case — to instruct amici to focus their briefs on the issue of likelihood of success at trial rather than irreparable harm, and to limit the briefs to 15 pages. Lee said he would “get the message out” to amici and estimated there might be between six and eight briefs.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in an email to affiliates Wednesday that Harvard was not given any notice about the order as they were making their decision for the fall semester, which was announced just hours before the guidelines from ICE.
“The order came down without notice—its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness,” Bacow wrote. “We believe that the ICE order is bad public policy, and we believe that it is illegal.”
The suit alleges that DHS and ICE violated the Administrative Procedure Act by issuing the “arbitrary and capricious” rules and failing to provide a notice and comment period before they took effect.
Rayford A. Farquhar — the chief of defensive civil litigation for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts, who represents DHS and ICE — remained the only lawyer who appeared on behalf of ICE and DHS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 10, 2020, 5:39 p.m.
Abdullah M. Bannan ’23, a Syrian Harvard student, took a circuitous route to campus his freshman year. He drove from Syria to Lebanon, then flew to Italy, and finally transferred to the U.S. — a 30-hour trip in total.
He has not returned home to Syria since, and an obstacle course of closed borders and travel restrictions will prevent him from doing so anytime soon.
“Going to Europe is virtually impossible for me now due to travel restrictions, and definitely not to Lebanon because Lebanon is not letting anyone into their country, except for Lebanese people,” Bannan said. “Then the problem that comes after that is going from Lebanon to Syria, because Syria’s borders are also closed.”
But Harvard’s all-remote fall plan and new government rules may also make it equally challenging for him to remain in the U.S.
Hours after Harvard announced Monday morning that all its courses will be virtual, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released an order barring international students enrolled in universities offering only online courses from staying in the United States.
Many international undergraduates said they met the news with fear, anxiety, and grief over a profound loss of stability. Harvard and MIT have since challenged the rule in a lawsuit filed in District Court in Boston Wednesday morning.
During the town hall for international students, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the guidelines have put universities in a bind, one where they must decide between prioritizing the health and safety of its affiliates and supporting their international students. He called the dilemma a “Sophie’s Choice” situation, referencing a 1982 film in which a woman must choose which of her children to send to gas chambers in Auschwitz.
Khurana promised town hall attendees, however, that Harvard’s senior administrators have dedicated their attention to the success of Harvard’s lawsuit against DHS and ICE.
Maureen Martin, who directs Immigration Services at the Harvard International Office, said at the town hall that while Harvard must await the results of the lawsuit before giving further guidance, the guidelines permit students currently in the U.S. to remain stateside through the summer.
“At the moment, you don't need to start packing and get a flight out this week,” she said. “This is such a rapidly evolving situation at the moment that we can't really give you a date by which you'd have to leave the U.S. and hopefully, we are going to prevail in court and it won’t come to you leaving the U.S.”
Since Monday, many international students said the federal rule and Harvard’s fall plan have upended their plans for the near future.
Estela L. Franca ’23, who hails from Brazil, was staying a few minutes from campus in Brookline, Mass. when she received news of the federal order via text.
“It was a very dramatic day,” Franca said, describing how her morning began with Bacow’s 11 a.m. missive and the realization she and her fellow sophomores would not return to campus in the fall.
“I tried to start figuring out what I was going to do, whether I wanted to go to Brazil, whether I wanted to stay and live with friends somewhere — that had been the plan all along. And then three hours later, I received a text with the new ICE guidelines, and that kind of shifted everything,” she added.
The federal decision in particular has affected Franca, she said.
“Every hour of my life since then has revolved around the situation with the new ICE ruling,” she continued. “On Monday, I cried for hours, just because it didn't seem like there was going to be any way around it.”
If Harvard’s lawsuit fails in court, Franca said she would return to Brazil and take her courses from afar. She said she is not considering taking a leave of absence because she does not want to deactivate her visa status by declining to take classes for more than five months.
During Wednesday’s town hall, Martin said students who take a leave of absence would have to forego their F1 visa status and complete another I-20 form upon their return. She said, however, that students would not need an F1 to complete their studies remotely since the visa is only required to enter the country, not to enroll in classes.
For some international students still living in the U.S., however, both staying in the U.S. and returning home appear untenable.
Tuzo Mulunda ’23, an international student from Kenya who has been living on campus since March, said she is unable to return home because Kenya’s borders remain closed.
“I would have to leave the U.S. but the thing is, I literally cannot get a flight to my country because it's still on lockdown,” she said. “So I'm stuck in this place where we have to leave. But even if I wanted to, I literally cannot.”
Bannan, subject to deportation from the U.S. and simultaneously unable to return to Syria, is in the same predicament. Even if he were able to go home, his departure from the U.S. would jeopardize his eventual return to campus due to the Trump administration’s executive order in 2017 banning travel from several mostly Muslim countries, including Syria.
He added that completing his studies in Syria would be impossible because the country has banned Zoom. Because current U.S. sanctions on Syria prohibit economic transactions and services, which may include educational services, he fears he may have to withdraw as a Harvard student lest the University face prosecution.
Mulunda and Bannan both said they intended to petition to remain on campus in the fall semester to take their online classes in Cambridge. The current guidelines, however, have dashed those expectations.
Justas Jasevicius ’21, who is currently at home in Lithuania, also said he hoped to stay with his blockmates in a Boston apartment for the semester. The federal order complicated his plan, which was already temporarily thwarted by the Trump administration’s ban on travel from nearly all European countries.
“I’m happy that Harvard is doing something. I just really hope they're prepared for a negative answer from the courts,” he said.
Several universities, including Columbia University, have decided to circumvent the federal order by committing to create a hybrid program with in-person and remote learning opportunities through which international students could attend occasional in-person class meetings to avoid deportation.
In response to student questions about the possibility of a hybrid model in the fall, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh said during the town hall that Harvard is still “committed” to its decision to conduct all classes remotely next semester.
“We thought very hard about this for a very long time, and this is what we think is the best, so we are confident or hopeful at least that we will get relief in court,” she said.
Jasevicius said he was happy to hear many deans and professors offering to teach in-person classes for international students should Harvard resort to a hybrid model like other schools. Still, he said, such a model may not offer students recourse because of travel restrictions.
Barbara A. Oedayrajsingh Varma ’21, who is from the Netherlands, also said she worried a hybrid model would force international students unable to leave their country due to travel restrictions or health concerns to unenroll.
“A hybrid model might mean that students outside the U.S. will be forced to unenroll. But if there’s no hybrid model, students inside the U.S. will be forced to leave, which may not be possible,” Oedayrajsingh Varma said.
Fabrizio Serafini ’23 said the federal order is forcing him to take his classes at home in Italy, where he and other international students have discussed plans to forge a makeshift Harvard microcosm far away from campus. But the disruption still worries him, he added.
“It's this feeling that you don't know what's gonna happen the next year, and you cannot be happy,” he said. “You cannot be sure of how your future is gonna look because you don’t know where you're going to be. You don't know whether you will have the chance to finish your education in the United States.”
Like Serafini, Franca described the uncertainty as overwhelming.
“I've been in the country for five years, always on an F1. And it's always been a looming threat that if something happens, they could take it away,” Franca said.  “This has always been a threat in the back of our minds because what guarantees us staying in the country is the stamp on our passport and the I-20 papers.”
“This is almost like a nightmare situation,” she added. “It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen and then it happens.”
