After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In September of 2022, I became depressed. I’ve battled depression for most of my life, and this iteration was not caused by any misdeeds on Harvard’s part. Really, I don’t know what caused it. Nobody is to blame, except maybe the inevitability of change and separation. That elusivity made the depression feel hopeless in a way that it never had before. It wasn’t explained by being mercilessly bullied, or by losing someone I loved. It couldn’t be fixed by moving to a city, or by pretending I was happy. Sometimes I would walk back to my dorm at midnight, exhausted, cold, and alone, and just stop and stare forward, hating myself for feeling the way I did.
But when I got home for winter break, I watched “Harvey.”
“Harvey” is a comedy film, released in 1950, based on a play by Mary Chase. It follows Elwood P. Dowd, an eccentric alcoholic whose best friend is an invisible, six-foot-tall rabbit named Harvey, as well as his sister Veta and her attempts to institutionalize him. Initially, Elwood is ostracized, treated like dirt by everyone in his life. But as the movie goes on, more people start to listen to him and come to see him as an exceedingly kind, gentle, and loving man. In one of my favorite lines of the movie, Elwood says: “Years ago, my mother used to say to me — she’d say, [...] ‘In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart, or oh so pleasant.’ Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant.”
I was inspired to watch “Harvey” while reading John M. Green’s “The Anthropocene Reviewed,” a book of nonfiction essays in which the author reviews aspects of his life on a five-star scale. In his review of the film, Green invokes Elwood’s quote while talking about his own debilitating bout with depression. It made him feel less alone, made him more comfortable, and gave him hope. “In December of 2001, there was perhaps no human alive on Earth who needed to hear those words more than I did,” Green says.
Like it did for Green, “Harvey” gave me hope and reason. And like Green said, “Hope is not easy or cheap. It is true.”  For so much of my life, I’ve tried to be “oh so smart.” This came to a head in the sixth grade during my first serious bout with depression. I was being mercilessly bullied, but my defensive response was to become self absorbed, mean, and combative. I had dangerously low self confidence and a desperate need for validation, because of a deep rooted worry that I was insignificant.
After sixth grade, I tried to change. I moved schools, surrounded myself with different people. The most important change, however, was a newfound willingness to listen. I continued to battle occasional depression, but it felt manageable. I wasn’t the only person struggling with self worth, with sadness, or with pain. That gradual realization also came with a dramatic shrinkage of my overinflated ego. I built legitimate confidence — the type that wasn’t rooted in convincing myself that I was superior to others. I realized, for the first time, that everyone was just as complex as I was.
But the ugliness that used to dominate my life began to bubble up again when I moved to Cambridge. My progress wasn’t completely undone, but I felt, for the first time in years, the need to be smart, which is perhaps an unfortunate inevitability of being at a place like Harvard. And what I needed, desperately, was to be pleasant.
In “Harvey,” when Elwood is talking to two Sanitarium workers who’ve tracked him down about the people he meets at the local bar, he says: “They tell about the big terrible things they’ve done and the big wonderful things they’ll do. Their hopes and their regrets, their loves and their hates. All very large, because nobody ever brings anything small into a bar.”
Nobody ever brings anything small into a party, a rehearsal, a class, or anywhere, really. Listening has made me realize that I’m not alone — and that really, nobody else is, either. Those moments where I’m pleasant, not smart, are the best moments of my life. I want to know people’s wants and hopes and regrets. And I want to be there for people to share them with me. I want to understand those big things. Doing that has made me happier and more pleasant, and it has filled my life with beauty. It has made me realize that my ongoing mental health struggle is not a curse I uniquely have been bestowed with, but that pain and grief are universal.
The world is amazing, complicated, and messy. And by far the most amazing, most complicated, and messiest part of the world is people. We have spent thousands of years trying to understand what it means to be human. And the only way we can do that is to listen, and to understand what it’s like to be someone other than ourselves. I’m not expecting you to be as kind as Elwood. I’m just asking you to listen, to try to understand the people around you. It will fill your life with beauty and complexity.
Next time you feel alone, sit down and listen to someone you care about. And try watching “Harvey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Campus tourists are annoying.
At Harvard, this stance is a basic tenet of undergraduate life. Most of us adopt it quickly and uncritically, expressing disdain from the first instance of uninvited photography or blocked walkways. Our annoyance seems reasonable — this campus is our place, so goes the common refrain, and we shouldn’t have to deal with the constant, near-voyeuristic intrusion of outsiders in our place of living and learning.
Our unspoken logic is simple: We belong here, and they do not. Naturally salient but not explicit are claims of entitlement (we deserve to be here; they don’t), superiority (we’re good enough to be here; they’re not), and ownership (Harvard is ours, not theirs).
This line of reasoning is awfully precarious. Our sense of entitlement, superiority, and ownership all rely on status gained from a single decision made by the Admissions Office. Is it truly reasonable to claim that acceptance to Harvard — a mark of “merit” steeped heavily in chance, privilege, and legacy status — effects such immediate and certain distinction? Undoubtedly, Harvard students have a claim to ownership at Harvard — we’re the ones who power its research and pay its tuition. But we’re not the only ones who can rightfully claim ownership.
Whether we like it or not, Harvard — the school, the symbol, the mythology, the history — is a project of joint ownership. As a practical matter, the university benefits from massive indirect public investment via hidden taxpayer subsidies disguised in the form of its tax-free endowment. As of 2015, this benefit was equivalent to $48,000 per student, almost five times the taxpayer investment per student at Massachusetts’s flagship public university. From a historical perspective, too, Harvard is a monument, a national symbol. Our university has educated eight U.S. presidents and is older than the nation itself. It is inextricably linked to American history. From any perspective, it’s only reasonable that Harvard be, at the very least, available for public viewing.
Most importantly, Harvard’s immense cultural clout marks it as an object of public interest and ownership. Consistent media coverage, recurrent public debates, outsize importance in politics and business, and regular Hollywood attention all contribute to a near-obsessive level of public attention — a veritable “cult of Harvard” in American popular culture. We’ve all encountered it in impressively uncreative nicknames from high school friends, copy-and-paste Linkedin entreaties from Harvard hopefuls, and the oddly exhilarating dread that arises when asked “Where do you go to college?” It’s the same cultish attraction driving the tourist swarms. And we hate it.
Or so we say.
But we don’t actually hate the cult of Harvard; in fact, for many, if not most, of us, it’s part of the reason we’re here. It figured in our decision to commit to Harvard, and it undergirds our self-image and self-worth — whether we admit it or not. This makes sense: In our putatively meritocratic society, going to Harvard is the ultimate mark of success. The clout, attention, and brand power of the Harvard pin on our lapels provide real goods — both material and psychological.
So why do the tourists irritate us? If their presence is just a particularly immediate manifestation of the cultural fixation we seem to enjoy, our exasperation makes no sense. Shouldn’t we enjoy all the attention they provide? Rather, our excessive annoyance with campus tourists reveals something else: an ambivalence about the cult of Harvard — a preoccupation with several unresolved questions over our university’s peculiar cultural role. For example:
Is the cult of Harvard just? I assume many would join me in arguing that the immense prestige afforded to Harvard alumni in the professional world produces and exacerbates systemic inequities.
Is the cult of Harvard democratic? The predominant bias toward Harvard graduates in American politics, almost by definition, is not conducive to representative government.
Does the cult of Harvard reflect reality? Is this university really the best, permanently and axiomatically? Forbes, U.S. News, QS, Times Higher Education, and Niche don’t seem to think so.
And perhaps most importantly, is the cult of Harvard really good for us, Harvard’s students? Does it set realistic and healthy expectations? Does it prepare us to participate in our communities with humility and integrity? Each semester I spend here, I become increasingly concerned that the answer is no.
These are reasonable and important ethical questions. They should be pondered by every critical and compassionate thinker in this community of enormous privilege and cultural power. We should shout them at administrators, job recruiters, admissions officers, and each other. They should become topics of debate, reason for self-interrogation, and fodder for genuine unease.
No matter where it takes us, the targets of this unease should not be campus tourists, who are merely partaking in a cult of Harvard they had no part in creating. So long as the cult of Harvard continues to benefit us, we need to let go of the antipathy. Let the tourists be tourists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Think of the biggest changes in the past 100 years. Troves of information once confined to a few libraries in the world are now accessible at the click of a button. Messages that would once take weeks to deliver can now reach their destinations almost instantaneously. Movies can be streamed on demand almost anywhere in the world. But you know what is almost exactly the same as it was 100 years ago? Higher education.
Over the course of this semester, this column will examine crucial challenges with higher education and propose recommendations for improvement. This first piece takes aim at low-hanging fruit — something that has been around for at least a millennium: the lecture model.
One would think that universities might experiment and innovate in their pedagogical approaches, searching for creative ways to improve student learning. Instead, the lecture model’s one-way communication from professor to student remains the norm.
Unsurprisingly, sitting 20 feet from what often feels like a poorly-performed one-person theater piece is not the best way to learn. Lectures have low retention rates and fail to cater to students’ different learning styles. One study found that undergraduates were 1.5 times more likely to fail examinations in STEM classes employing traditional lectures than in equivalent classes implementing more active learning methods.
Instead of the standard design, professors should post recordings of their lectures for students to watch at their own pace to prepare for class. Students struggling with the material or for whom English is not their first language could rewind or slow the lecture down as they please. And all students can choose to view the recordings whenever they are more alert and able to focus.
Then, in person, classes should be redesigned such that students grapple actively with the material, rather than listen passively. For instance, the professor could pre-select a different group of students each class and then engage those students in extended dialogue, probing the ideas from that week's readings. Alternatively, the professor could moderate a debate between two smaller sections of the class or have different sections present their analysis of the concepts introduced in the lecture recordings. Professors could also assign roles to students and play out mock scenarios.
There are a wealth of possibilities, and the examples above will certainly not work well for every class or subject. The point, though, is that professors should be far more creative in order to maximize the pedagogical value of a limited amount of available class time.
This alternative system — prerecorded background lectures with hands-on in-person activities — is known as a “flipped classroom,” and in the past several years, researchers have conducted hundreds of studies to determine whether a flipped classroom can outperform traditional lecture-based learning. In a meta-analysis of about 300 of these studies, scholars at Hope College found that flipped learning substantially increases students’ academic performance and engagement. On average, students in flipped classrooms gained a stronger grasp of the foundational knowledge conveyed in the course and were more likely to engage in higher-order thinking than students in lecture-based classes. In addition, flipped classrooms improved students’ confidence, interpersonal skills, and metacognitive abilities such as planning and time management relative to their static counterparts.
In short, flipped learning seems to be more successful than lecture-based learning. Courses focused on teaching specific skills — language, technology, and health science classes, for example — seem to have improved the most. But flipped learning is also used successfully in humanities, social science, and laboratory courses.
Of course, not all material lends itself to a flipped model. Sometimes, fundamental concepts or particularly complex topics might be best explained by the professor during class sessions. Mathematics and engineering, in particular, seem to be particularly difficult subjects to flip. Nevertheless, colleges must start experimenting by slowly phasing in flipped content, especially in those lecture courses that can be more easily redesigned. Otherwise, higher education will continue to leave too many benefits on the table.
Lecture-lovers will undoubtedly object that flipped classrooms cost too much and take too much time to create. However, the only real immediate costs come from producing the recordings, many of which already exist for classes that were filmed when universities transitioned online during the pandemic. These videos can be again transferred from drab pandemic learning into the flipped learning format. In addition, professors, with a smidge more creativity, can find ways to implement flipped learning, even in larger classes. It is likely true, though, that in the long run, effective flipped learning might require breaking up some of these gargantuan classes to improve their student-faculty ratio. But isn’t that a good thing?
Active learning in a class of 50 seems far better than passive listening in a 150-person auditorium. And institutions like Harvard have hefty enough endowments to invest in active, small-setting learning; if they need to hire a few more professors and a few more teaching assistants, so be it. The costs will have been worth it to improve the educational experience.
It’s finally time for higher education to start experimenting and innovating just like the rest of society. Step one: Move beyond the lecture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faro Café — a vibrant new coffee shop on the corner of Arrow Street — opened its doors last month, inviting passersby to step into the regenerative space for a hot cup of coffee.
Owned by Henry F. Hoffstot, Faro Café served its first cup of coffee on Dec. 14. Though it joins several other established coffee shops in Harvard Square, its owners say Faro aims to do more than just serve coffee: the vision behind the cafe, Hoffstot said, is around the “sensation” customers have when they enter the space.
“It’s about letting the space be something that people interpret how they want to envision it or define it or inhabit it,” he said. “We’re hoping that people make Faro what they want — what they need — and that the space can lend itself to a variety of different community-focused purposes.”
The cafe’s name comes from the Spanish word for “lighthouse,” a nod to Buenos Aires, where Hoffstot lived for four years.
Trading paper to-go cups for ceramic mugs and latte art, Hoffstot said he hopes Faro Café gives a more “romanticized” idea of coffee — something to be enjoyed slowly, instead of just being fuel for productivity.
Even in the quiet of an early Sunday morning, customers had already found their way inside, settling in with books and laptops.
Priyanka Saxena, a Somerville resident, chose a spot tucked in behind the soundsystem of the cafe.
“I come a pretty long way to get to a cafe early in the morning and it’s because it’s a really nice vibe,” she said. “There’s nothing too busy or ostentatious about it, but it’s cozy.”
“The pastries are great, the coffees are delicious, and it’s just a nice spot to relax in the morning,” she added.
Harris S. Kaplan, a postdoctoral fellow in Harvard's Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, sat at a long table in the main space with a decaf coffee. Kaplan was on the hunt for a new coffee shop haunt to replace Darwin’s Ltd. — a famous Cambridge coffee shop that recently closed its doors — when he stumbled on Faro.
“I live right around the corner, so that’s why I was looking for a new cafe,” he said. “I like it — I like that it’s not too busy on a Sunday morning, like a lot of cafes are.”
Andre L. Ferreira ’23 described the cafe as “nice and calm for students.”
“I do like supporting local establishments rather than big franchises, so I think it’s a nice place to go,” said Ferreira, who was joined by Maria Keselj ’23 as they enjoyed the cafe’s offerings and worked on their laptops.
“I feel like we need more cafes around,” Keselj said. “There aren’t too many coffee shops to study at, so I’m glad this opened up.”
Samantha D. Lilly, a barista at Faro, described the cafe as a place that “fills the community.”
“The cafe is supposed to be a regenerative space, not a space that you come into and it takes from you,” Lilly said. “It’s a space to get things back into you, which is love, community.”
“It’s not supposed to be like some bougie place where you can’t order what you want without feeling bad about it,” they added. “Get your vanilla lattes and your mochas and your vanilla mochas if you want.”
Correction: January 24, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Faro Café is co-owned by Henry F. Hoffstot and Milagros Ratto. In fact, Hoffstot is the cafe’s sole owner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students were abuzz last Friday following a guest lecture from Kim Kardashian at Harvard Business School.
Kardashian, an entrepreneur and media personality who rose to fame after starring in the reality television show "Keeping Up with the Kardashians," delivered a lecture to students in an HBS short intensive course "Moving Beyond Direct to Consumer." Kardashian spoke about her clothing brand SKIMS for the course, which examines companies that sell directly to customers without a traditional retail middleman.
After an investor told HBS Professor Leonard A. Schlesinger — who teaches the class — that SKIMS would be “an amazing case” for students to study, he set up a meeting with SKIMS’s co-founder Jens Grede. Schlesinger said the meeting “reaffirmed, quite honestly, my own excitement about the learning opportunities for students.”
Part of what interested Schlesinger about SKIMS was its growth and revenue numbers, which he said are “at a pace that are virtually unheard of in the world. Though the company was started just three years ago, Schlesinger said it was recently valued at $3.2 billion. Last year, he added, 140 million users visited SKIMS’s website.
For Schlesinger, SKIMS’s meteoric rise gets at the core of his course’s message, which reiterates how businesses are able to acquire customers at a lower cost than their competitors through social media.
Palis Pisuttisarun ’24, an undergraduate technology innovation fellow at HBS, was thrilled to see Kardashian — one of his “top three role models” — in person.
“The morning of her visit, I was picking out my best look because I knew Kim Kardashian was going to see me, and I had to look my finest,” said Pisuttisarun.
Pisuttisarun said he admires Kardashian’s business acumen and persona.
“I think people have this notion of Kim being dumb or she doesn’t deserve the success that she has. I think that woman knows what she’s doing,” Pisuttisarun said. “She’s very strategic, and she definitely is an entrepreneur at heart.”
Izumi H. Vazquez ’25 — who heard about Kardashian's visit from a friend the day of the lecture— waited for 45 minutes in the rain with a pack of HBS students to see the reality television star set foot on campus.
“It was a surreal moment,” Vazquez said. “I did not expect to wake up and see Kim Kardashian that day.”
Students weren’t the only ones thrilled to have Kardashian on campus. In a tweet thanking Schlesinger for having her, Kardashian said her visit to HBS was a “#BucketListDream.”
After Kardashian’s lecture about SKIMS, the students in the class chatted with Kardashian more freely.
“Folks loved her and how she was really kind of approachable,” Pisuttisarun said. “She took a copious number of selfies with the folks in the class.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Public Schools welcomed Francisco Alves as its new executive director of special education during a Special Education and Student Supports subcommittee meeting on Monday evening.
Alves took on his new role in December, replacing Jean Spera, who graduated from CPS and has worked in the district since 1986. During her tenure, Spera led the development of the district-wide strategic plan to “provide high quality inclusive education” for students with disabilities.
At Monday’s meeting, Cambridge School Committee member Ayesha M. Wilson said that Spera leaves behind “an indelible mark” on CPS, but added that the district is ready to welcome “Dr. Alves and his fresh perspective.” The Cambridge School Committee is a seven-member team responsible for determining budget and policies for CPS.
David Weinstein, a Cambridge School Committee member, said the change in leadership is a “really important time to take that fresh look and chart the course moving forward.”
Alves holds a master’s in special education from Bridgewater State University and a Ed.D. in curriculum development, teaching, learning, and leadership from Northeastern University. Prior to his current role, he served as a department head for a school district in Brockton, Massachusetts, for six years. Introducing himself at Monday’s meeting, Alves said that he has effectively “run the gamut” of special education throughout his career.
“For the longest time, I’ve been working in special education — ever since being a residential counselor, to house manager, to you name it,” Alves said. “It’s always been a passion for me.”
Alves said his main priorities include learning more about the district’s existing policies, challenges, and culture to better understand “the Cambridge way.” He also argued for the importance of using qualitative data “to reduce or eliminate disproportionality and suspensions and over-identification of students with disabilities.”
“The methodology of my madness — if you will — is to meet and conversate with various stakeholders to collect qualitative data,” Alves said.
He also discussed observations made while visiting schools and speaking with stakeholders.
For instance, Alves proposed expediting communication between the district and outside psychologists when assessing whether students need special education support. He also suggested updates to the implementation of the Individualized Education Program — which creates a specialized education plan for every student with disabilities — including greater collaboration and objectivity.
“When you go into a team meeting, and the team facilitator actually did an assessment there, there’s some unconscious bias,” Alves said.
Alves also said that instead of creating new programs, the office needs to cultivate programs that would best develop students’ skills.
“We can’t just label our programs based on disabilities,” Alves said. “We need to label our programs based on what skills we are going to be developing and supporting the students.”
Alves also argued for the necessity of including the parents when developing individualized programs, adding that he hopes to find “middle ground” between education professionals and families.
“We want all parents to feel like they are part of the team,” Alves said.

Former Representative Jamie Herrera Beutler (R-Wa.) — one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump — and seven other politicians will serve as fellows at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics this spring, the IOP announced in a Tuesday press release.
The five other resident fellows are Kristin L. Amerling ’87, the chief counsel and deputy staff director to the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol; Negah Angha, former director for multilateral initiatives for the National Security Council; Quentin Fulks, the political strategist and campaign manager for Senator Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.); Matthew Raymer, the chief counsel of the Republican National Committee; and Jason Rezaian, an opinions columnist for the Washington Post.
The spring 2023 cohort will also welcome two visiting fellows: Kate Brown, the former Governor of Oregon, and former Representative Cheri Bustos.
IOP Interim Director Setti D. Warren said in the release that the incoming fellows possess “experience at the highest levels.”
“At this pivotal moment for our politics in the United States and democracy around the world, we are excited to welcome an incredible group of Fellows to Harvard to engage and inspire our students,” Warren said.
Over an eight-week period, the IOP resident fellows will lead study groups with students on topics in their areas of expertise, including “government ethics and oversight, diplomacy and statecraft, governing in a divided America, modern campaigns, national political parties, and Iran and freedom of the press,” according to the release.
The study groups are slated to begin Feb. 13.
Sebastian R. Feune ’25 and Elizabeth M. Benecchi ’25, the co-chairs of the Fellows and Study Groups program at the IOP, said in the release that they look forward to the diversity the fellows will bring to the IOP.
“As we enter 2023, we come out of a year of great political intensity, from global struggles with democracy and territorial integrity to the increased divisiveness of a new Congress,” they wrote. “This incoming Fellows Cohort will bring much-needed conversations to the table to help inspire and enrich the perspectives of students not only at the IOP, but also in the greater Harvard community.”
Beutler said in the release that she is enthusiastic about upcoming political discussions.
“When asked to help lead curious and passionate minds in candid conversations about the state of American politics, I said count me in!” she wrote. “Today we desperately need transformational leaders to meet our nation’s challenges head-on.”
Incoming resident fellow Rezaian said in the release that he “can’t imagine a more appropriate time” to be returning to Harvard after his fellowship at Nieman Foundation for Journalism from 2016 to 2017.
“Momentous events are gripping Iran, the U.S. and its allies are all struggling to combat a new kind of hostage taking, and the very notion of press freedom is under greater threat today than ever before,” said Rezaian, who spent 544 days in Iranian prison in 2019. “Engaging with the university community as an IOP Fellow on these issues and others is a unique and incredible opportunity I feel extremely fortunate to have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council discussed a proposal to create a new arts center in Central Square in a Monday meeting that was later disrupted by protesters and moved online.
The proposal aims to transform the Central Square home of beloved Cambridge artist Peter Z. Valentine — who died last August — into a new arts space. During the meeting, residents debated possible uses for the eccentric home, proposing to repurpose it as either a city cultural center or affordable housing.
Cambridge resident Lydia Eccles, who created an art space in Boston with the advice of Valentine, said she believes the artist would have advocated for his home to be turned into a “creative center to develop culture in Cambridge.”
“He would have been the first person at a city council meeting saying ‘Art is what makes people want to live,’” Eccles said of Valentine. “He was very dedicated to eliminating banality.”
Other residents suggested transforming the home into affordable housing.
“The housing, especially very low-income, is the most important,” said resident Shelley Rieman.
Resident Vivek Sikri said Cambridge has changed significantly in the twenty years that he has lived in the city, and he asked the Council to prevent the Valentine property from being turned into condominiums.
“If we don’t save places like the Peter Valentine house and just let developers grab it for as much money as only they can pay, turn it into more drab condos, more luxury apartments, then we’re going to wonder, in ten years, if people will come here and say, ‘Hey, what is this Cambridge cultural district? I don’t see anything cultural here,’” Sikri said.
Cathy Hoffman, a Cambridge resident of 45 years, said she supported using the Valentine home both as a cultural space and affordable housing. Hoffman also tried to discuss a statement she had submitted regarding the fatal shooting of resident Sayed Faisal by Cambridge Police earlier this month, but was interrupted by Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui before she could finish her remarks.
“That’s not on the agenda right now, so if you can just keep it to the items that are on the agenda before us, thank you,” Siddiqui said.
As public comment came to a close, protesters interrupted the meeting to demand answers in the police killing of Faisal. Councilors voted to recess over the chants of protesters in the audience, then exited the chamber. The meeting resumed in a virtual format around 30 minutes later.
When the meeting continued, council members discussed the agenda of City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05, beginning with a conversation about forbidding turns on red signals. After discussing implementing additional “No Turn On Red” signs at remaining intersections, all but one councilor voted in favor of putting the item on file.
Further items on the agenda included the plausibility of street cleaning without towing, a $390,000 budget allocation for a street connection in Alewife, an environmental construction regulation, and parking requirements for cannabis dispensaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard-led team of researchers found in a study published earlier this month that internal ExxonMobil projections accurately predicted human-caused climate change even as the company downplayed its risks in public statements.
The study, published in Science Magazine on Jan. 13, found that 63 to 83 percent of ExxonMobil scientists’ climate models accurately projected subsequent global warming, including estimated levels of carbon dioxide that would cause “dangerous warming” and detectable human-caused climate change by approximately 2000.
Researchers analyzed internal global warming projections by ExxonMobil scientists between 1977 and 2003 as well as peer-reviewed published studies by the company’s scientists from 1982 to 2014, testing the company’s predictions against climate observations as well as independent academic and government models.
History of Science professor Naomi Oreskes, the study’s co-author, said in an interview that the researchers found the ExxonMobil climate projections were “extremely skillful,” with accuracy that often matched or exceeded models by independent academics and government scientists.
The researchers wrote that despite the accuracy of climate change projections by ExxonMobil scientists, the company denied climate science in its public communications by “overemphasizing uncertainties” about climate change and “feigning ignorance about the discernibility of human-caused warming.”
“We’re able to show that there were massive discrepancies between how ExxonMobil presented the issue in private versus how they presented it in public,” Oreskes said.
In an emailed statement, ExxonMobil spokesperson Todd M. Spitler wrote that the Harvard-led study and other reports claiming the company’s early awareness of climate change “are inaccurate and deliberately misleading.”
“This issue has come up several times in recent years and, in each case, our answer is the same: those who talk about how ‘Exxon Knew’ are wrong in their conclusions,” Spitler said. “For more than 40 years, we have supported development of climate science in partnership with governments and academic institutions. That work continues today in an open and transparent way.”
Former History of Science research associate Geoffrey J. S. Supran, the study’s lead author, said in an interview that he believes the study is the “smoking gun” that proves ExxonMobil knew about climate change early on despite its public communications downplaying the phenomenon. He added that it was important to “put a number” on the accuracy of the company’s internal reports.
“They say a picture paints 1000 words, and this one shows how Exxon knew and misled on climate,” Supran said. “This basically seals the deal or closes the case on what Exxon knew and when.”
Oreskes said the study suggests disinformation from fossil fuel companies is to blame for climate inaction, rather than a lack of public scientific literacy.
“What was really going on was a massive, well-organized, and highly professional, very well-funded propaganda campaign,” Oreskes said. “Climate change is one of the easiest scientific concepts to explain, but we were facing a massive disinformation campaign.”
The study serves as a warning for public belief in industry-led research, Oreskes added.
“They say that they are committed to being part of the solution, but we don’t think that’s true,” Oreskes said. “We think if you look at the evidence, what you see is that disinformation continues, and so that’s why we’re motivated to continue to study it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Protesters stormed Cambridge City Hall and marched into Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui’s office Monday evening to demand answers on the police killing of Sayed Faisal, calling on city officials to release the names of the officers involved in the shooting.
The protest interrupted an otherwise ordinary city council meeting, with more than a dozen protesters demanding justice and transparency on the Jan. 4 fatal shooting of Faisal — a 20-year-old University of Massachusetts Boston student and Cambridge resident— by a Cambridge Police Department officer.
Led by Somerville resident Suhail P. Purkar, the protest was the latest in a series of demonstrations sparked by resident outrage at the killing, with gatherings at Cambridge City Hall on Jan. 9 and Harvard Square on Jan. 14.
“City Manager Huang, Mayor Siddiqui, it has been two weeks since our brother Faisal was murdered!” Purkar shouted from the audience, as the Council voted on a motion to conclude public comment. “We still do not know the names of the officers who murdered Faisal!”
The councilors immediately motioned to recess as protesters shouted from the rear of the chamber, with some demonstrators holding a large banner with a portrait of Faisal and the inscription “Justice for Faisal.”
As councilors rose from their seats and hurried to the exits, the protesters remained in the chamber and chanted “Release the names,” “No justice, no peace,” and “Send those killer cops to jail,” for several minutes.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an emailed statement that no one was arrested in connection to the protest. In a Jan. 6 statement, Warnick wrote that it “would not be appropriate” to comment on specific allegations while the shooting remains under investigation by the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office.
Siddiqui did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On the afternoon of Jan. 4, police responded to a report of a man harming himself with a weapon. According to a CPD press release, officers asked the man, Faisal, to drop the weapon, and fired non-lethal sponge rounds when he allegedly advanced toward them. An officer shot and killed Faisal when he continued to approach, the press release said.
Purkar, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, said in an interview that the protesters sought the release of the full, unredacted police report and the names of the officers involved in the killing, as well as their removal from the department.
“They’re on paid vacation right now,” Purkar said. “In what other profession can you murder somebody and then go on paid vacation the very next day?”
The chants continued outside the chamber as protesters stormed Siddiqui’s office and pounded on her door, disrupting Siddiqui’s attempt to resume the meeting over Zoom and following through on their chant to shut down “business as usual.”
As the meeting resumed at around 7 p.m., Councilor E. Denise Simmons asked if protesters were still in the building. Shouting could still be heard in the background of the Zoom webinar several minutes after business resumed.
Purkar said he deeply distrusted city leadership, challenging claims that Cambridge’s leaders are progressive on policing.
“Both Mayor Siddiqui and the police commissioner present themselves as progressives, as people that represent the community,” Purkar said. “If they really represent the community, if they really stand for our interests, then they would give in to the demands of the community.”
“They want to kick the can down the road. They want to have a prolonged cover-up. They want to wait for the steam to dissipate from the movement,” Purkar added. “We refuse to do that.”
The Cambridge City Council will hold another special meeting on Wednesday in response to the police shooting of Faisal. Purkar said protesters would attend the special meeting, and would hold a march at Somerville High School on Sunday.
Correction: January 24, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly described Suhail P. Purkar as an organizer with the Party for Social Liberation. In fact, Purkar is an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation.
