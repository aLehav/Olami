After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In novels like “Lolita” and “The Catcher in the Rye,” readers are asked to follow an unreliable protagonist in hopes of gaining a new perspective by the end of the journey. In Benjamin Stein’s novel “The Canvas,” translated from German by Brian Zumhagen, readers are met by not one, but two unreliable narrators—Amnon Zichroni and Jan Wechsler—each eager to take the story in their own direction. Stein’s meticulously crafted plotlines are so complete with details and recurring anxieties that by the end of both narrations, it is even difficult to separate the two narrators. Though each story starts in a different time and location, they end up irreversibly and eerily fused so that it is impossible to say which narrator is telling the truth. This indeterminate treatment of truth is one of the greatest strengths of the novel.
The physical layout of the book accomplishes as much for the novel as the intertwined plotlines. One story reads from the front to the back and the other story reads from back to front; readers are thus stuck flipping the novel over and back to keep up with both narrations. Just as the narrators choose how to tell their stories, readers are similarly free to choose the order and method by which to read them. “Behind each cover is a possible starting point for the action,” reads the disclaimer on both front and back covers. “Where you begin reading is up to you, or to chance.” The verdict of the innocence or guilt of each narrator is different depending on the order in which the stories are read. Only a confident and skillful writer like Stein would give such a dangerous privilege to his readers.
Both narrators focus their stories on the murky concept of memory, each determined to uncover the true past. “Each time we remember, we reshape, filter, separate and connect, add in, take out, and replace the original bit by bit over time through the memory of a memory,” says Amnon. “Who, then, can say what really happened?” Stein sketches a fuzzy reality in which mysticism and lies reside close to the actual the truth.
Amnon and Jan, both Jewish, travel through Switzerland, Germany, the United States, and Israel at different times, each wandering in search of an ultimately unattainable sense of belonging. While Jan’s narrative starts in the middle of his life when he is married with two children, Amnon’s narrative begins with his childhood. As Jan’s examination of his own life travels backward into personal memories he has forgotten or suppressed, Amnon’s narration travels forward as he encounters the memories of other characters. Stein backs up the struggles of both of his narrators with parts of Jewish text in a unique combination of religious and mystical anecdotes. This combination of modern and biblical comparisons creates points of convergence between the two stories. While maintaining distinct voices for each of his narrators, Stein draws the ideas and memories of each closer and closer until both minds arrive at a common character: Minsky, a man whose made-up memoir of his childhood in a concentration camp is ousted by Jan Wechsler.
The character of Minsky draws inspiration from Binjamin Wilkomirski, a man who published a fabricated memoir in 1997 about his supposed childhood as Holocaust survivor. Wilkomirski’s fraud was revealed by a Swiss journalist three years after his memoir was published. The same sort of controversy exists in “The Canvas,” though this time, Stein casts doubt on whether the Swiss journalist—in this novel, Jan Wechsler—was right in his claims of fraud.
The reader meets Minsky in both Jan’s and Amnon’s narrations, and he is portrayed as a victim of the media in both stories. “His life, as he described it to me on our way back from Poland, appeared to him like a canvas, like an oversized, forged painting,” says Amnon. “He was stripping away the colors in order to reveal the primer coat, the first five years of his life, that had been crudely painted over.” Either Minsky’s memories are incorrect, though they are real to him, or he is lying. This dichotomy exists almost ironically in Jan’s story as well. He too cannot remember the truth about his own childhood. “I am what I remember. I don’t have anything else,” Jan says. “If the documents now appear to prove that a large part of my memory is unreliable, then I myself am unreliable.”
At times, Stein’s portrayal of Jan’s unreliability is forced and readers are bogged down with reiterations of Jan’s confusion, as in the previous snippet from the novel. That aside, Stein molds each scene like a sculptor, and his tight, unexpected prose gives each story enough literary weight to stand on its own. Though the intriguing merit of this novel arises mainly out of Stein’s decision to tell the story from two perspectives, this is not to say that the mode of storytelling is this novel’s only aspect worthy of praise. If one were to read each narration as a separate entity, both would prove to be intriguing and expertly woven. When the reader finally surfaces from the turbulent waters of fabricated memory, it is not clear whose perspective is less obscured by inconsistencies. Yet because Stein paints parallels through each story, there remains an overall understanding and sense of cohesion that is sewn through the fabric of “The Canvas.”

“I don’t record," says photographer Sharon C. Harper in a firm voice. “I don’t have a composition. I have an idea.”
Harper, an associate professor in the Harvard VES department, is an accomplished artist in her own right. Her pieces feature in prominent permanent collections such as those of the MOMA, The New York Public Library, and the Whitney Museum of Modern Art.  From bright lines upon a dark sky showing the slow peregrinations of stars over several days to blurred images of nature, her works are always a dynamic attempt to circumvent old clichés of the medium: instead of proverbially “capturing a moment in time,” Harper prefers to document changes between moments and to seek out and amplify human perceptions of the unseen. Her work is often all about photography itself—the interaction of the camera with the nature it records.
The Harvard Crimson: Have you ever been interested in working with media other than photography and video? Why and how did you decide to go into these?
Sharon C. Harper: I started photography when I was 17, and I was interested in creative writing at the time, but I’ve never been interested in any other medium. One of the things I will say about photography is oftentimes I’m making images that have visual similarities to video, silkscreen, painting, [and] drawing, so I’ll try to incorporate different visual language into photography.
THC: Which artists, thinkers, or theorists are you most in dialogue with when you create?
SCH: I think surprisingly I’ve been really inspired by sculpture and dance. You know the visceral and kinetic response you can get through sculpture and through dance? I think you can also get that in photography, and it’s interesting for me to think about ways to incorporate that. Kinetic connection to work is really important to me.
THC: How did you get involved in the theme of cosmic bodies, which features in a lot of your work?
SCH: I was looking for a way to photograph that contained [an] element of transformation. And when I photographed during the day, I found that the subject matter was too descriptive; the daylight was too descriptive in the photos I was taking. It was too descriptive of reality...when you’re dealing with darkness, you’re up against the technical limits of photography. Subject-wise, in the darkness there’s this element of surprise. First I was working with moonlight, but then I’d be at a point where I’d just point my camera at the moon...trying to create some relationship with something so far from us. And yet we all talk so much about the influence of the moon on us. So there’s this cultural understanding that we have a connection, but it’s not a connection that’s explored that often.
THC: Can you give us an example of the technical conventions you play with in a recent work of yours?
SCH: In [my] video, “Landshift,” I’m playing with ideas of our ability to pin down space, place, and time in one moment. It’s constantly shifting, and it’s also collaged, so that there is no single place, space, or even single perspective. Oftentimes people want to know how my work is made or pin something down, but I’m far less interested in the mechanics of how it’s made than the questions that it asks or the ways of seeing that it poses, the questions it opens up.
THC: How do your philosophies of photography inform or shape the other workings of your personal life? How do the questions you play with when you do your artwork carry over into other aspects of your life, or other hobbies you have?
SCH: I’m trying to use the camera to show me something I don’t know, to work from the unknown into the known, or to generate the known from the unknown…. One of the very real ways that translates into my life is I like to travel. I like situations that renew my perspectives and show me things I haven’t seen and reawaken all my senses.
THC: You speak a lot about the phenomenology of inhabiting the environment and passing through it, and it seems there’s a subjectivity of an implied human presence as you do it. Do you think your art will ever feature people in it?
SCH: Well it has, it has in the past. There’s this series on my website, called “walkabout,” with a figure walking through the landscape…. From that point onward, it’s the human consciousness…the kinetic connection between moving through a landscape and changes in your state of mind. [My] figures drop away, but you know, it’s all about your interiority; it’s all about individuals and subjectivity. So the individual’s there, but just invisible.

PRO: History’s artistic canon is rife with many names revered for their artistic accomplishments, despite glaring shortcomings of personality.  Be that as it may, to blindly accept an artist’s work with no regard for their personal philosophy requires a forced ignorance of an inescapable aspect of the art.
Richard Wagner is a perfect example of one such name. Wagner is commonly considered one of the greatest operatic composers of all time, perhaps second only to Mozart; however, unlike Mozart, Wagner was a well documented anti-Semite. He is responsible for influential and beloved operas such as “Der Ring des Nibelungen” (the Ring Cycle) and “Tristan und Isolde,”  but he is also responsible for writings such as the infamous “Das Judenthum in der Musik” (Jewishness in Music),  in which he asserts that Jewish musicians are not capable of producing true, meaningful art due to lacking the genuine German spirit. In this same essay, he suggests that Jews can only be redeemed by “going under,” most likely meaning total social assimilation into German culture.
To laud Wagner’s music is not bad per se, but to do so without at least some acknowledgement of its roots is ignorant. To this day, attempts to stage Wagner’s operas in Israel have provoked protests and uproar. Art is irrevocably connected to the views and emotions of its creator, as it stems directly from the creator’s mind. Art cannot be viewed in a vacuum, as much as people may wish to discuss art within a hypothetical space. It is not possible to set up “The Ring Cycle” as an isolated system as one might for a physics problem, because that runs counter to the very nature of the art itself. Artistic expression is messy and human, and to attempt to view Wagner’s works completely independently of Wagner’s beliefs is to sterilize and strip away parts of the works.
Art is informed and influenced by the views and emotions of the artist, whether it be by conscious effort or subconscious stimulation. For someone like Wagner, whose works directly addressed issues of German nationalism and who wrote prolifically on his philosophical and political views, the crossovers between the realms of the artist and his art are numerous. One might argue that Wagner’s work is beautiful despite the man, and that a listener could appreciate it without worrying about his anti-Semitism. While it may be possible to enjoy Wagner’s music with blinders on, can it still be called Wagner’s music when one removes Wagner from the equation?
—Staff writer Alexander Tang can be reached at tang@college.harvard.edu.
CON: Richard Wagner’s influence on Western music has always been tainted by allegations of anti-Semitism. His essay “Das Judenthum in der Musik,” attacks Jewish musicians in the spirit of German nationalism, even going as far to claim that it is impossible for Jews to produce music that isn’t shallow or artificial.
Should Wagner’s legacy and place in the musical canon be compromised by his political views? Although it may be difficult to isolate a composer’s work from his person when evaluating his legacy, it is ultimately incredibly important to do so out of fairness to the artist.
Wagner’s work was extremely influential in the development of classical music in the 20th century.  He was known for his operas of unprecedented scale, and he revolutionized Western tonality; many musicologists cite the “Tristan” chord in the opening of his opera “Tristan und Isolde” as the point at which music begins to move towards atonality, a trend that continues today.
The shadow of Anti-Semitism continues to haunt Wagner’s image despite his musical achievement. It is difficult, if not impossible, to divorce an artist from his or her personality. However, when assessing a composer’s place in the musical canon or a legacy, this is an important step to take, since it makes little sense to analyze a composer on both the musical and political spectra, just as one would not value a politician on his compositional merit. Although some of Wagner’s operas are influenced by politics, it would be illogical to equate his music and his views.
Today, Wagner’s music has developed a life of its own separate of his personal life allowing us to judge him on his musical merit alone. We hear his influence on tonality in impressionism, surrealism, and even film scores, whereas “Jewishness in Music” has simply become an example of his narrow-mindedness. As much as we should condemn him for harboring and spreading his prejudiced views, Wagner’s influence as a composer has far outlived his influence as an anti-Semite. Historically, Wagner’s incredibly vast influence on music transcends his shortcomings and cannot be discredited.

How to begin describing Adam Sandler’s Dracula voice? Words spring to mind: grating, shrill, and farcical in an inane way. Well, try to predict the effect of Sandler attempting to sound like a vampire, and you’d be about spot on. However, Sandler’s wearying accent is not even the greatest fault of “Hotel Transylvania.” Rather, the focus on Sandler’s less than compelling plotline combined with the enjoyable supporting cast teases the viewer with the potential of an entertaining animated film without delivering.
“Hotel Transylvania” describes the development of the Count’s relationship with his non-canonical daughter Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez) over the weekend of her 118th birthday. Invited are the bastions of gothic fiction: Frankenstein’s monster, who is fallaciously called just “Frankenstein” (Kevin James), the Mummy (Cee Lo Green), and Wayne the Werewolf (Steve Buscemi). What really throws a wrench in the cobweb-covered work is the arrival of Jonathan (Andy Samberg), a wide-eyed and feckless human backpacker. Not only does Johnny immediately catch Mavis’ eye, but he also endangers the Hotel’s thus far spotless reputation as a haven for monsters.
It’s hard to decide whether Sandler as Dracula—also frequently called “Drac”—was entertaining or just plain irritating, but, ultimately, he is rarely involved with the best jokes. Compared with the subtle wit of many recent family comedies, Sandler’s slapstick sound is distinctly unimpressive. Dracula aside, “Hotel Transylvania” does deliver some genuine laughs: a maniacally giggling demon sponge or zombie Mozart trading heads with zombie Bach, for example. There is also some great character-based comedy from the likes of the socially awkward Invisible Man (David Spade) and the genuinely disturbing, cannibalistic Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz)—whose French accent is “Ratatouille” meets “Chuckie.” Given the lackluster story of Mavis, the movie would have benefited greatly from following the model set by “Toy Story,” which relies more on secondary characters.
The best comedy moments are reliant upon the characters’ movements: the pinpoint timing of Dracula’s swoops and scurries, the clattering knights and the flapping capes. This is shown to best effect in the perfectly choreographed action sequences. It is artistry of this kind that makes the movie far more entertaining than it would otherwise be; the Gothic references, while occasionally turning up a gem—Dracula claiming that he “invented fun”—are usually unintelligent, utterly relentless, and often flat. When Dracula finds himself on a plane and sees a passenger watching a “Twilight” movie, the only response is a “Is that what they think of [vampires]?” that is emblematic of a cheap shot.
The script is certainly clunky and inelegant in places, particularly in the more emotional scenes—if Sandler doesn’t ruin the moment, then the cringe-inducing lines can be trusted to tilt the scales into absurdity. After the standard of emotional poignancy that we have learned to expect from animated films such as “Up” and “Wall-E,” something feels distinctly lacking in “Hotel Transylvania.” Perhaps it is because the delivery at these times seems fundamentally clichéd and thus insincere.
Dreamworks and Pixar have set the bar high for quality family entertainment, and Sony Pictures Animation has fallen far off the target. Thus far its films, including “Open Season” and “Surf’s Up,” have failed to reach the legendary status earned by the other animation studios, instead remaining temporary fodder for transatlantic flights.
The cinematography is devoid of the stunning visuals found in other recent animated comedies—notably “Kung Fu Panda.” Instead, it is mainly focused on the winding corridors of the castle and its howling, squelching inhabitants. Director Genndy Tartakovsky may have had difficulty distancing his first feature-length film from the style of his earlier works, such as “Dexter’s Laboratory” and “Star Wars: The Clone Wars;” The entire movie gives the impression that these characters would be better displayed in the episodic format of a children’s television show. Then, the secondary characters could be further developed and the plot would not seem so forced.
Ultimately, there are many ways in which “Hotel Transylvania” fails to excite; although it is a mildly entertaining yarn, it lacks the subtlety, wit, and intelligence that is found in so many other animated films. Despite its genuine humor, it remains transient and forgettable.

It’s been mere weeks since Clint Eastwood delivered his empty-chair monologue at the Republic National Convention, and audiences will have a hard time shaking it from their memory as they watch “Trouble with the Curve.” Eastwood plays aging baseball scout Gus Lobel, a more doddering and less racist version of the misanthropic retiree he played in “Gran Torino,” and the film’s opening scenes present him as a man ravaged by weakness and senility, the qualities that seemed disturbingly present in his already infamous speech. Yet as “Trouble with the Curve” progresses, Eastwood makes clear that he’s just acting, and that there’s still a great deal of life left in Mr. Eastwood himself. If only the same could be said for the movie. Despite its star’s commendable performance, the film is a curiously mawkish piece of work, one that willfully ignores the darkness bubbling beneath its maudlin surface.
The plot centers on Gus’s attempts to scout a high school player in North Carolina. Unfortunately, a pompous co-worker (Matthew Lillard) is urging Gus’s boss to replace him with a computer program, and glaucoma is wreaking havoc with the elderly man’s eyesight. The latter dilemma means that Lobel’s estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), is obliged to take a leave from her legal career and watch over her dad as he goes on the scouting mission and occasionally socializes with rival scout Johnny Flanagan (Justin Timberlake). None of this is remarkably out of the ordinary for a sports movie, yet the film seems to hint at more troubling issues: senility, mortality, obsolescence.  It then proceeds to ignore those issues with an absurdly neat ending, featuring redemption and comeuppance doled out in quantities so exact the film comes to resemble a zero-sum game.
These problems are epitomized by the treatment of Lillard’s character, Tom Silver.  As Silver, Lillard is meant to be nothing more than a blowhard, spouting lines like, “It’s all in the computers—you don’t need to see the players.” The film never asks the audience to engage with this philosophy—it just asks them to dismiss it. This is a fatal misstep. Silver represents the possibility of obsolescence for Gus—a possibility that Lorenz and screenwriter Randy Brown urge the audience to shrug off. One wonders what Eastwood himself would have done with the material; though director Robert Lorenz has served as Eastwood’s producer for a number of films in the past decade, he can’t conjure up the sort of clear-eyed vision that drives a film like Eastwood’s “Mystic River.”There is another reason to wish that Eastwood hadn’t confined himself to acting in this film: Lorenz, for all his producing credits, proves himself a startlingly uninspired director. The film contains several sequences shot with astonishing clumsiness —crucially, the only scenes that actually involve sports. Nearly every one of these sequences leans heavily on slow-motion, making what should be the most invigorating scenes into overdone dreck. Even the less egregiously directed scenes leave the viewer with little to admire; in a movie filled to the brim with conversations, Lorenz chooses to shoot every one with the same three-quarter shots. In a movie nearly two hours long, this lack of variety grows infuriating quickly.
This technical incompetency is especially frustrating because it obscures the cast’s respective performances, which are largely quite enjoyable. Amy Adams, as a female outsider in a world of male obsessives, turns in a competent variation on her role in “The Muppets.” Lillard and John Goodman, as Gus’s good friend and co-worker, also give fine supporting performances: Goodman, as usual, simply exudes likability, while Lillard, hot off his role as an adulterer in “The Descendants,” seems primed for a career as a consummately slimy character actor. The one real mistake is the casting of Timberlake as Flanagan, a star pitcher turned scout. Though the chemistry between him and Adams is palpable, Timberlake is ultimately far too slick and effete for this role, which demands a more convincingly athletic actor.
Yet these performances can’t rescue what is essentially a half-baked project, one that includes clear hints of darkness seemingly only to ignore them. “Trouble with the Curve” is an aggressively optimistic film that does nothing to merit that optimism; though the main exposition is portray how difficult it is for Gus to survive on a day-to-day basis, the filmmakers ultimately ignore the premise that they’ve set up. These issues are exacerbated by a directorial style that is at best undistinguished and at worse thoroughly inept. It’s a good thing Eastwood still shows signs of life; “Trouble with the Curve” might otherwise be an undeserving end to an iconic career.

The sounds of nature can be almost musical. The wonders of nature can be almost poetic. But just how often do we really view nature as a source of acoustic wonderment? The Great Animal Orchestra, through a fusion of natural sounds and poetry, endeavors to get people to truly listen to the world around them and to appreciate the beauty that biophony (the sounds of animals) and geophony (the sounds of the earth) have to offer. On Thursday, September 27, Bernie Krause and Jonathan Skinner brought their work to the Fong Auditorium in order to share this message with Harvard students. Krause, co-creator of The Great Animal Orchestra and author of a book by the same name, has recorded countless animal sounds for The Orchestra. The performance compiles years of recording and research. “It’s really summarizing a life’s work in music and natural sounds,” said Krause.
The other creator, Jonathan Skinner, is a poet who has written and compiled poems about animals and nature to intermittently accompany Bernie’s recordings and add a different level of reflection to the sounds. “Sound is invading poetry, and poetry is colonizing sound,” said Skinner. The result of this unprecedented collaboration of natural soundscapes and poetry was something truly unique: The Great Animal Orchestra.
So what would one see wupon entering a showing of The Great Animal Orchestra? The truth is, not much at all: Krause and Skinner were seated in the front of the performance area, each with a laptop, some papers, and a sound board in front of him. But seeing is not the point of this performance. The goal, rather, is to orient the audience aurally to the beauty of natural sound. After briefly introducing themselves, the creators took the audience on a journey from the mountains to the tundra with biophony and nature-themed poetry as the only guide. The musical imagery brought the  biospheres to life and highlighted the natural harmony between the different  creatures.
Interestingly enough, animals tend to stay out of each other’s way when it comes to making sounds; the sounds have a rhythm of their own. Many of the soundscapes that Krause played featured multiple animals who would take turns calling out, mirrored by Skinner’s and Krause’s acoustic choice of reading part of a poem and then playing part of a recording. Anthrophony, or human sound, is much more random. Krause, through his research and recordings has discovered that our random jumble of sounds disrupts the environment’s natural rhythm. “Human sound is random. It has lots of noise, [which] causes us lots of stress. But also if human noise finds its way into the biophony it causes stress with the animals,” he said. This represents one of the production’s main themes.
Thus, in addition to showing audiences the beauty of nature, The Great Animal Orchestra also warns people of the dangers of interfering with it.  Most prominent among these hazards is the current extinction crisis, a problem Krause believes is caused by humans’ negligence for the environment. Furthermore, they see this presentation as a way to give people tangible evidence—in the form of soundscapes—of what human interaction has damaged and exactly why people should care about nature. “Bernie and I both feel that we want our work to have some kind of meaning…. We want to show people that our place on the Earth is not as masters but dwellers, not landlords but neighbors, and how we can become better neighbors. And for us, listening is where all that begins,” Skinner said.
As for the show itself, both Krause and Skinner believe that they accomplished their goal of showing the audience how musical nature could be and were quite pleased with how the performance turned out. Christina Davis, curator if the Woodberry Poetry Room and the driving force behind bringing Krause and Skinner together for this presentation, was also impressed with how innovative the show was. “It was very brave of them to bring together their collective knowns to create something unknown,” she said. This kind of innovative performance brings together different themes in a way that is new for the audience.
So what did Krause want the audience to take away from the performance?  “Just shut the hell up and listen,” he answered. And that’s really all that needs to be said.

People keep asking me if I like bees.
I don’t—I’m deeply terrified of their harmless, fuzzy little bodies—but I have what looks like a honeycomb tattooed on my right shoulder.
As a disclaimer, I’m not cool or hip, nor am I trying to sound like I am. I don’t consider myself An Individual because I paid a lovely bearded man named Aaron to scratch things into my skin. I am not trying to assure anyone that I am free-spirited or artistic. I am trying to explain that I was willing to sit shirtless on an uncomfortable pleather chair for two hours while Aaron cheerfully gouged out bits of my flesh with a needle because of a story.
It’s one of many in “Labyrinths,” a collection of essays, short stories, and poems by Jorge Luis Borges, an Argentinian writer born at the tail end of the 19th century. I’m not sure if I could call “The Library of Babel” my favorite work in the anthology since they’re all stunning, but it’s the one I’ve reread the most times and the one that inspired my tattoo.
The narrator begins with a description of his library, his universe: composed of a vast but finite number of interlocking hexagonal rooms and containing a vast but finite number of books that have the same number of pages, and the same number of words on each page. The library, he explains, contains every possible combination of letters and spaces that can fit into that number of pages. It follows, then, that within this library are all of Shakespeare’s works, novels that are not yet written, the true origins of the earth, the fan-fictions for E.L. James’ fan-fiction, repetitions of the lyrics to “Call Me Maybe” with Freudian quotes inserted between verses.
The point, however, is that our librarian narrator knows that his life story is written out, and his existence explained, in one of these volumes. The difference between him and the other librarians spread out throughout the hexagons is that he is not searching for his book, while the others drive themselves mad searching for theirs. Instead, he prays that some librarian at some point finds the volume that validates the entire universe: “I pray to the unknown gods that a man—just one, even though it were thousands of years ago!—may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let Heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified.”
My interpretation of the story may be overly simplistic. I don’t pretend to fully understand the fictional encyclopedias or textual mazes Borges presents in “Labyrinths;” indeed, many of his stories are meant to trick the reader. If you buy into everything Borges tells you, Borges wins.
I’ve probably lost to Borges. I find it very difficult to maintain a critical distance from his stories because I find them hugely comforting. At the risk of sounding cliché, I’ve often turned to reading when I’m having a hard time dealing with the real world, and I’ve often opted to read something out of “Labyrinths.” It’s not necessarily because Borges’ stories offer an escape from reality. Borges simply tries to explain reality using a certain amount of magical realism. In reading “The Library of Babel,” I can feel reassurance in the idea that even if the justification of our lives is never explicitly revealed to us, it still very much exists in one of those symbolic hexagonal rooms.
There are many pieces in “Labyrinths” worth mentioning, but “The Library of Babel” is the one that has literally made the greatest impression on me. I also can’t help but love the personal fixations Borges sneaks into the story: his fear of mirrors and reflections, his preoccupation with individual validation, and his love for math and geometry. He actually chose hexagons knowing that they are the only shape that can tessellate to infinity—bees weren’t very significant to him. His favorite animal was the tiger.

What’s so great about college? According to Jesse Fisher (Josh Radnor), it’s the fact that “You can go up to everyone here and say, ‘I’m a poet,’ and no one will punch you in the face.” Ironically, Radnor’s sophomore attempt at directing, producing, and writing his own film is his own way of letting the world know that he’s a “poet.” While the film includes insightful commentary on the necessity of letting go of the past, the majority of the plot is cliché, and thus, it is clear that Radnor is also worried about having someone “punch him in the face” for taking a risk. While “Liberal Arts” is certainly a major improvement over the catastrophe known as his first film “HappyThankYouMorePlease,” it ultimately becomes confusing due to the separate plotlines’ inability to mesh.
“Liberal Arts” begins when 35-year-old admissions counselor (Radnor) falls in love with Zibby, a confident but naïve 19-year-old student (Elizabeth Olsen) when he returns to his alma mater to deliver a speech at his favorite professor’s retirement party. Following this initial set-up is a disjointed series of scenes that persists until the movie’s end.
The disparity of topics makes the movie seem as if Radnor attempted to stuff every idea that he had about romantic suffering in a long-distance relationship—and a 16-year age gap to complicate it further—into a single movie. Unfortunately, while the scenes themselves are filled with witty banter, it goes under-appreciated as all of the random plotlines are too disjointed and unrelated to be written in a feature together. While moments with the wonderful Richard Jenkins and the scene-stealing Allison Janney are great in isolation, in the context of the whole film, their scenes distract from the main thrust. Even the unexpectedly hilarious Zac Efron, who plays Nat, a proverb-spewing college student who gives off the cool L.A.-hippie vibe and never appears onscreen without offering Jesse irrelevant advice makes the viewer wish that “Liberal Arts” could be divided into multiple short films instead.
Although the plot seems to have been forgotten altogether as the film progresses, there are some memorable moments. Namely, there are two great scenes in the movie: One of which is when Jesse and Zibby write to each other about the power of classical music and its effect of making one aware of things in life that are taken for granted. “Grace is neither time nor place-dependent; all we need is the right soundtrack,” he muses. When Jesse stops and raises his arms above his head after abruptly pausing from a jog in Washington Square Park to suddenly appreciate the fact that he has hands, the music soars and the camera pans to the sky, wonderfully tying together dialogue and production. The other scene that had the potential for great development is when Jesse tries to put the 16-year age gap in context. “When I was 19, she was 3,” he calculates on paper, covering his face with his hands. But then he picks up his pen again. “When I am 87, she will be 71.” That’s more than enough to convince Jesse that this long-distance, age-inappropriate relationship is okay to pursue, and the film disappointingly stops the emotional development there.
Although fans of Radnor’s hit TV show “How I Met Your Mother” will rejoice in the witty banter, the subpar execution of the dialogue highlights how the overall potential of “Liberal Arts” never comes to fruition. When Jesse sends a copy of William Blake’s “Songs of Innocence and of Experience” without prior reference to Zibby as an apology, it becomes sadly obvious that the movie is just a showcase of Radnor’s disjointed interests desperately stuffed into a single 97-minute feature.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a young girl, I wanted nothing more than for kitschy souvenir shops to sell, among their vast array of mugs and friendship bracelets, an item with my name pre-printed on it. Every Jessica and Ashley of the world got to have these, I moped, but I would have to suffer the repeated disappointment of never, ever seeing my name appear among 100 others on identical Statue of Liberty keychains.
My sense of name inferiority finally disappeared in “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince” when J.K. Rowling introduced one minor character, Leanne, Katie Bell’s friend. No, it wasn’t exactly my name, but who cared. If “Leanne” was a name worth including in the same paragraph as Harry and Hermione, I might as well have been a wizard.
It’s still possible to connect with “The Casual Vacancy,” Rowling’s latest tome, but the grounds of connection are surprising in their immediacy to everyday life. She accompanies a funeral with Rihanna and Jay-Z’s song “Umbrella” instead of Dumbledore’s phoenix dirge, explores teenage sexuality through internet porn and unprotected sex rather than love potions, and even replaces Quidditch with crew. Yet through it all, some constants remain: a deft skewering of small-town life, youthful disillusionment, and a character named Leanne. Only the Leanne of “A Casual Vacancy” is not walking back from Hogsmeade with Katie Bell. She’s the best friend of Krystal Weedon, a promiscuous, foul-mouthed child of a welfare heroin addict. We hear you loud and clear, J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter, this isn’t.
It nevertheless remains nearly impossible to read, analyze, and absorb “The Casual Vacancy” without invoking Harry Potter. How do you turn the page on a cultural milestone and open to a small town in southwest England, where the greatest drama involves a local election rather than a corporeal force of evil? Rowling’s tendency to rely on excessive adjectives and adverbs has lessened, yet she retains just enough of this trademark style to enliven descriptions: “The sky was a cold iron-gray, like the underside of a shield.”
This iron-gray sky lies over Pagford, a provincial town in the shadow of its larger neighbor, Yarvil. The story opens at the death of Barry Fairbrother, more an idea than a man, whose quest for social justice and equality reaches beyond the grave. His death leaves a gaping hole on a divided town council, and various citizens hurry to fill his shoes and exert their influence over the fiery controversy du jour: the inclusion of an area of low-income housing, The Fields, in Pagford’s upper-crust school district. This social commentary forms an intelligent backdrop against which to parade and judge a score of characters. From this unsuspectingly common premise, Rowling artfully exposes the intricacies of human relations with a colorful, memorable set of players.
Fraught with duplicity, seething with anger, and at times starkly hopeless, the citizens of Pagford often appear more as caricatures than realistic people. At times, indeed, the narrative feels overstuffed. Rowling careens from one third person limited point of view to another; this is certainly a more holistic approach than her singular focus on Harry, but at times the array of characters is dizzying (though Rowling helps the reader out by periodically repeating their names and occupations).
All these perspectives do not always serve the story well. The beauty of Harry Potter was its single-minded devotion to the end battle. Any side adventure that occurred was almost always in service of a greater narrative. “The Casual Vacancy” may be significantly more adult in its content, but Rowling risks losing readers along the way due to narrative offshoots. The book could have benefitted from a more condensed focus, yet Rowling’s ambition to fully explore the disparate lives of so many characters is admirable in its scope. Several books could have been written about the most compelling ones—adventurous and outspoken Fats, self-destructive yet compassionate Krystal, pimpled and besotted Andrew, corpulent and corrupt Howard, steely and driven Parminder, and the elusive, deified Barry Fairbrother.
If Rowling’s goal was to expose how different worlds can haplessly intersect, she’s done her job. She has frequently stated her adamant support of social welfare, and perhaps partially informed by her own pre-Potter bout with poverty, Rowling’s descriptions of privation, neglect, and drug abuse are often shocking in their audacious power of prose. “But she had seen far worse,” thinks Kay, a social worker, “welts and sores, gashes and burns, tar-black bruises; scabies and nits; babies lying on carpets covered in dog shit; kids crawling on broken bones; and once (she dreamed of it, still), a child who had been locked in a cupboard for five days by his psychotic stepfather.”
Rowling seems nearly to wink at her Harry Potter fanbase with this cupboard reference—“Think Uncle Vernon was abusive, do you?” she might be asking. “This is the real world.” Harry Potter was an introduction, through the lens of magic and ultimate happiness, to momentary loss, disappointment, and death. Here, though, when a relative, spouse, or friend is gone, they’re lost forever. Characters may have jarringly conspicuous access to the latest technology, but with no Resurrection Stone, “Priori Incantatem” spell, or Mirror of Erised at their disposal, this new treatment of death is decidedly harsher.
The final Harry Potter book was released four days before my 15th birthday. I was living in Chile for the summer and anxiously journeyed to the nearest mall to get the book. Dawn crept through the curtains as I finished it the next morning. It hadn’t been released in Spanish yet, and my host siblings begged the main details out of me the second I was done reading.
I nonchalantly bought “The Casual Vacancy” two days after it appeared in stores. It took me three days to read rather than a night—the driving tension, both on my part and on Rowling’s, simply was not there. Rowling, however, is not a one-hit wonder. Darkness, redemption, and even humor are more layered and complex in her latest effort. But the “Potter” cohort is grown up and probably ready to spend more than one night digesting the moral maelstroms of a book. A fast read isn’t always the best read. “The Casual Vacancy” has its moment of gut-wrenching horror, finely sketched characters, and steady-handed authorial intention. Rowling can’t babysit the literate youth of the world forever; finally, she drops the hand holding for a hard but welcome slap of reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last winter, a 20-foot-tall wooden structure designed by architect Keith Moskow sat on the Rose Kennedy Greenway in Boston, waiting for snow. It was meant to collect the snow and freeze it into icicles, which would form around large, swaying metal chimes and then crack and fall, but the piece never got the chance to perform—it was one of the warmest winters on record in Boston history.
Moskow described the unanticipated failure Thursday in a discussion entitled “What is Today’s Public Art? A Chorus of Ideas,” which was cosponsored by Harvard’s Arts @ 29 Garden and the New England Foundation for the Arts. Moskow and 11 other regional artists whose media range from bronze to baseball caps gave brief presentations on their recent work and debated issues of activism and accessibility in public art.
Like Moskow, several of the participants identified themselves as more than artists. Lori A. Lobenstine, the co-founder of the Design Studio for Social Intervention in Roxbury, said she considers herself an activist. She described her work with urban youth to design Let’s Flip It, a campaign against violence centered around the symbol of a white baseball cap. “We started to feel like activism was getting stuck in some familiar forms,” Lobenstine said. “Artists have helped us think about the symbolic and particularly how symbols are used by communities, cultures, and people to make collective meaning.”
Activism also figures prominently in the work of China Blue, who aims to raise awareness through light sculptures of light pollution—particularly, she said, because it diminishes the noticeability and wonder of fireflies’ lights. And Sara A. Hendren, a Graduate School of Design student, is working to improve wheelchair accessibility through ramp design and construction and through a website devoted to the concept of slope. Hendren, who calls herself a “public amateur,” said after the discussion that she values the opportunity public art provides to advance her cause subtly and creatively. “I started to think about what the public art project would look like that would raise this issue [of wheelchair accessibility] but not be finger wagging and a purely policy-change effort,” Hendren said.
As in Blue’s piece, the idea of mimicry of nature arose in other artists’ works, like those of Ben M. Houge. Houge described his new piece at the Boston Harbor Islands Pavilion—a large, pixelated screen that lights up in accordance with various data inputs. Some pixels reflect the light patterns of the Boston Harbor Islands lighthouses, while others reflect tides, waves, winds, and bee populations on the Harbor Islands.
Elizabeth Billings and Andrea Wasserman have also worked together to produce installations reminiscent of nature. They presented a recent piece, installed at the City University of New York School of Law, that features stripped saplings. The piece is intended to give the feeling of deep woods in an urban environment, according to Wasserman. She and Billings also have work in hospitals and airports. “I think our work often helps people just take a deep breath,” Billings said after the talk.
Houge and others also noted a persistent challenge that faces public artists—to make their work accessible and not overly enigmatic, but nonetheless thought-provoking. Houge, who has worked composing music for mass-market video games, drew a parallel between the need to build audience of a public artist and of an orchestra attempting to gain repute. “It’s not [about] giving people what they want to hear; it’s about creating a dialogue not only over the course of a concert program but over a season and over a couple of seasons and challenging people,” he said. “Even if they disagree, they’re drawn into the conversations.”
In an interview after the discussion, Houge asserted that art must in some way benefit society—an opposition to the view presented by another artist, Dan Sternof Beyer, that art is simply that which is considered as such by its audience. “I feel like to say that ignores the responsibility of art to ennoble,” Houge said. “I think there’s a responsibility that you’re doing something that is somehow making things better, somehow even making people better.”
But, Lobenstine said after the discussion, neither should artists neglect the artistic in art that aspires to social improvement. “If we want it to be an effective social intervention, it has to be beautiful or elegant or creative in a way that captures people’s attention. It can’t be like, ‘That was kind of lame, but I get their point’ [or] ‘That was kind of lame but it’s a good message,’” she said. “No, that’s not going to do the trick.”

On one late-’90s night, as other Harvard undergrads partied or hunched over their textbooks, Matthew R. Saunders  ’97 sat enraptured in the basement of the Carpenter Center. On the theater-sized screen before him played the work of Jack Smith, a filmmaker whose humdrum name belies his influence on artists who succeeded him, among them Andy Warhol—and Saunders.
“The most transformative thing I experienced here as a student was seeing two Jack Smith films,” said Saunders, a visiting lecturer on Visual and Environmental Studies. Now, a decade and a half later, an animated short by Saunders plays on the same screen that showed Smith’s films. The animation is part of Saunders’ new exhibit, “The movies that were secret remain secret somehow and a nation forgets its pleasures.,” which takes its title from a Smith essay.
The exhibit, which runs through November 4 in the Carpenter Center basement and Harvard Film Archive, is part of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Carpenter Center. But particularly, Saunders said, it is a tribute to the basement itself and to the HFA, which is housed there. “When I was a student, I spent a lot of time in the Film Archive, and it was a really important place for me,” Saunders said. “If I thought of the history of the building and [of] trying to say something about it through the eyes of someone who spent a lot of years here, that was the place I wanted to speak to.”
And speak to it he does—the exhibit is less an art show than an interaction with the space. “It’s not exactly a show, because a show would be organized more tightly,” Saunders said. Instead, the exhibit primarily features two short animations, one shown in the theater and one housed under the stairs that lead to the basement of the Carpenter Center. A display case in the basement also holds some of Saunders’ static works, and prints of his visual art have been inserted alongside informational materials about upcoming films at the Archive.
As he began to conceive the exhibit, Saunders said, he knew he did not want to organize a straightforward gallery show; instead, his first inspiration was to work with the HFA theater located in the Carpenter Center basement. “I had this idea of this empty theater with this film playing as some kind of gesture of returning my work back to some place that was meaningful to it,” Saunders said.
For Saunders, who concentrated in VES, the Carpenter Center has always had two distinct rhythms—that of the VES classes taking place above ground and that of the HFA and its film screenings in the basement. “I thought it would be interesting to treat this space as a place where [the rhythms] mix more” Saunders said. The exhibit’s central film plays from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. every weekday in a space that doubles as an HFA theater and a lecture hall for VES classes, though at a time when no classes are held. “It’s occupying the negative space of [the VES class and HFA] program,” Saunders said.
Other elements of Saunders’ exhibit also make use of negative space—for instance, the small prints nestled among the informational blurbs and images displayed by the Film Archive. And in the animations, the foreground images, which range from abstract shapes to distinct people and objects, retain their grayscale palette while the background space alternately flashes black and white. “It’s about destabilizing,” Saunders said of the flashing. “A lot of these films are these very still images that I feel are unstable in some ways, so I wanted to introduce another vocabulary of this kind of endless motion.”
Of the static visual art featured, many works are large “photo prints” created by shining light through painted canvases to expose the photo paper. “The traditional approach is so uninteresting,” Saunders said. “The bigger photo prints, you could say that they’re hybrid objects between painting and photography.” Saunders, who said he considers himself foremost a painter, has previously experimented with other painting techniques—another work on display was made by painting both surfaces of a plastic sheet.
Though Saunders works in disparate styles and media, HFA Director Haden Guest said that Saunders’ body of work is united by his passion for film. “Matt’s work is really engaged with cinema, and a lot of his inspirations and seeds for the imagery of some of his most powerful works come from films. He’s an artist who’s really in dialogue with cinema,” Guest said.
Guest feels that the exhibit, in part inspired by Saunders’ experience at the Archive, serves also as a testament to the value of the HFA. “I think this show draws attention to…the kind of films that are being shown here,” he said. And perhaps, one quiet night, another young artist will wander into the theater to see the work of an innovative filmmaker and be indelibly inspired.

Tucked into a basement on Mt. Auburn Street beneath a hair salon and photo shop, “The Million Year Picnic” may not catch the eye of the average pedestrian. But it is in this unlikely location that Tony F. Davis ’84 has established one of the most eclectic comic book shops this side of the Charles and an underground haven for every kind of comic fan. In business since 1974, “The Picnic” stocks everything from funky indie gems to standard capes-and-tights fare, with a sizeable t-shirt collection for those wishing to flaunt their inner nerds.
1. Saga by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples (Illustrator)
Davis says: “Vaughan, writer of the hit series “Y: The Last Man,” has essentially been AWOL from comics for the last two years to write television; Saga is his grand return to comics, and it’s our biggest seller.”
2. The Walking Dead by Robert Kirkman
Sales of this zombie epic have been hugely boosted by its AMC television adaptation. “It’s extremely impressive that Kirkman can keep things fresh after a hundred-plus issues,” says Davis.
3. Love and Rockets: New Stories No. 5 by Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez
4. Animal Man Vol. 1 by Jeff Lemire
This is the most popular of DC Comics’ September 2011 line-wide reboot, “The New 52.” He’s animal man. With animal powers. Enough said.
5.  Amulet Vol. 5: Prince of the Elves by Kazu Kibuishi
6.  Avatar, The Last Airbender: The Promise—Part Three by Gene Luen Yang
7. Prophet Vol. 1: Remission by Brandon Graham
Graham’s artwork, according to Davis, is like a synthesis of everything that’s out there; it has American, European, and Asian  styles all mashed together into one great book.
8. Feynman by Jim Ottaviani and Leland Myrick (Illustrator)
9. Hark! A Vagrant by Kate Beaton
10. Are You My Mother? A Comic Drama by Alison Bechdel

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The middle-aged Margaret (Johanna Day) sits uncomfortably in the sleek, glass-walled doctor’s office of her high school classmate, Mike (Michael Laurence), surrounded by diplomas and silver-framed family photos. “We’re just comfortable,” Mike says to Margaret, who has just been fired from her job as a cashier at a dollar store. “I guess that makes me uncomfortable,” Margaret replies wryly. Despite the obvious contrast between the former friends, the Huntington Theatre’s production of “Good People,” directed by Kate Whoriskey and written by David Lindsay-Abaire, which runs from September 14 to October 14, finds its strength not in forthright social commentary but in bittersweet humor and unflinching sincerity about the role of luck in one’s future.
Margaret loses her cashier job after her landlady, Dottie (Nancy E. Carroll), is continually late to babysit Margaret’s severely disabled adult daughter. Dottie threatens to kick Margaret out by the end of the month if she fails to find work. Mike cannot offer Margaret employment, but she manages to get an invitation to a gathering he throws in order to ask his wealthy guests for help. After Margaret decides to go to the party anyway after having her invitation revoked, the situation between her and Mike turns from tense to tempestuous.
“Good People” is David Lindsay-Abaire’s first new play since his critically acclaimed “Rabbit Hole,” which won the Pulizer Prize for Drama in 2007 and was adapted into a film by the same name. “Good People” provides more than laughs; it marks a return to his signature style of screwball situations, frantically high stakes, and alternatingly heartfelt and gut-busting black comedy.
Day delivers Margaret’s gallows humor  with a wry smile and enough disappointment in her voice to communicate Margaret’s pluck and desperation. Day’s persistence in her quest for employment is humorous, but she makes the cogs of Margaret’s mind visible when she delivers self-deprecating jokes and coyly needles  Mike. Day’s Margaret is always aware of her objective and the absences in her life.
Despite the play’s exploration of the main characters’ dire circumstances, the cast’s comedic instincts and Whoriskey’s small directorial touches give the play a greatly rewarding sense of levity. For example, Jean (Karen MacDonald) tells Stevie (Nick Westrate) outright that everyone in Southie thinks he’s gay for playing bingo so often. Whoriskey’s production is seamless, each joke landing perfectly. When Mike’s wife, Kate (Rachael Holmes), asks Margaret how the wine is, Day’s Margaret responds without missing a beat, “How the fuck should I know?”
“Good People” shines most in its surprises. This is not to say that the characters are inconsistent but the question of who is actually a “good” person is answered obliquely. Questions surrounding the paternity of Margaret’s daughter and the true nature of Margaret’s relationship with Mike in high school are never fully answered. The lack of clarity allows the play to represent life’s lack of cut-and-dry solutions, which Maggie could desperately use.
Whoriskey’s nearly pitch-perfect production is attenuated by two potential surprises that are removed. Holmes is endearing as a privileged daughter of a doctor, but her character does not develop. She has the comedic instincts to effectively drop hints about the strained nature of her marriage while maintaining her perky and manicured persona. But if Day’s Maggie responds to obstacles like a clown target in a ball toss game—she bounces back, more battered each time—then Holmes’ Rachel is elastic, rebounding the emotional wreckage that piles up between Maggie and Mike by the end of the disastrous night that takes up most of the second act.
More crucially, Laurence’s Mike never really comes off as likable, undermining the outcome between the romantic leads. Laurence and Day have chemistry but it’s unfortunately of the caustic variety; their dissolution is far from unexpected. If Laurence showed the slightest warmth towards Day’s Maggie, who clearly admires him as much as she pushes his buttons, then his transformation from a Southie friend to a chestnut hill doctor ashamed of his past would be more tragic for Margaret.
The surprises in the play are more than sentimental; they represent hope against the socioeconomic determinism that crushes Maggie and terrifies Mike. The uplifting moments and twists in the narrative disrupt the status quo represented by the bingo games, in which the play’s Southies wait for a lucky number.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the fall of 1980. Harvard professor Stanislaw Baranczak, a Polish poet then living in Poznan, Poland, was about to read his work. The bearded and bespectacled writer and his wife Anna stepped on stage and surveyed the room.
The city’s literati had come, but many others, like Anna’s aunt, had turned out, too. These audience members weren’t interested in the artistry of Baranczak’s rhyming poems, Anna recalls. They were hoping to hear a lyrical anti-communist rallying cry, and they were hungry for a political martyr, an intellectual who would lead the opposition against the communists. Then there was the shock of the room, itself. Members of the religious order, the  Dominican brothers, had organized the event. Baranczak assumed they would use a casual meeting room in their church’s basement. But he found himself in the church’s modern, minimalist chapel.
The crowd-ordained political martyr was to read his poetry standing at the altar, a crucifix hanging behind him. Baranczak looked out at the crowd and then back at Anna. He had no desire to shoulder his country’s burden. What he wanted was to write free from the confines of communist censorship.
“Uciekac, uciekac,” Baranczak growled to his wife. Run away, run away.
Though Baranczak didn’t escape the reading in the church, he did escape Poland the following year. In 1981, the year the crumbling communist government declared martial law in Poland, Baranczak left his native country, where he was born in 1946, and came to Harvard, where he taught, wrote, and translated for the next two decades. But Baranczak took leave from Harvard in 1999. The progression of his Parkinson’s disease, diagnosed several years after he arrived in the U.S., left him unable to continue teaching. In the years since, Parkinson’s has crippled his motor skills. Today, the poet’s voice, the foundation of his life and career, is so soft that his wife Anna, who teaches Polish at Harvard, can barely understand him. He was unable, therefore, to give an interview for this piece.
Throughout his career, Baranczak grappled with the political and personal implications of his poetry. Facing a longstanding tradition of the Polish political poet, Baranczak balanced his role as a public intellectual and his own desire to write for writing’s sake.
THE RED PEN
Two summers ago, when I was studying at the Jagiellonski University in Krakow, my Polish literature instructor, an older, professorial-looking lady with long, dark hair and thin-framed glasses, held up an illegal issue of Czeslaw Milosz’s “The Captive Mind.” This book was passed from Pole to Pole during the bleak post-war period, she told the class. Then, she handed the grey pamphlet to us for closer inspection. When the book came to me, I flipped through it, noting the smears on pages, probably left by greasy fingers. I didn’t try to read much—Milosz’s philosophies are beyond me in Polish—but I did catch two words on the final page: “Stanislaw Baranczak” sat at the very top of a long list of anti-communist conspirators.
Three years prior to the reading in the Dominican church, Baranczak had been fired from his teaching position at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan—the government’s response, Anna says, to Baranczak founding the city’s chapter of the Workers’ Defense Committee, an anti-communist resistance group. But Baranczak wasn’t too concerned. He told friends that his work at the university was taking too much time away from his writing, anyway. “You know what? I think he enjoyed that,” says Baranczak’s friend Wojciech Wolynski, now a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, who left Poland a few years after Baranczak. “He was fired, and he was laughing.”
This pink slip came with a spot on the communist’s black list, however. The poet wasn’t allowed to publish his work, and Baranczak was no longer able to give poetry readings at universities or other public forums. Government censors even blocked Baranczak’s attempt to publish translated poetry under a pseudonym, according to his wife Anna. Baranczak went underground. Though not cut from activist cloth, Baranczak felt the government’s totalizing control of literature, the media, and everyday life had gone too far. He therefore co-founded, edited, and wrote for “Zapis,” the first uncensored literary magazine to be published in communist Poland. He helped circulate uncensored literature smuggled in from abroad or printed illicitly by clandestine publishing houses, known collectively as the “samizdat,” therefore not constrained by the red pens of government watchdogs at the official, state-run houses. He often returned from Workers’ Defense Committee meetings in Warsaw with banned books. “If anything came from the capital, it came from him or by him,” says Wolynski, who worked as an illustrator for the underground press newspaper “Robotnik.”
”BURY THE BRAIN”
Uncensored expression came with certain challenges. Samizdat printing quality was poor; essays, novels, and poems were printed on cheap paper and in a tiny type with ink that smudged easily. Dissidents set up underground publishing houses in their houses or garden sheds, and others’ houses and apartments would serve as covert bookshops. Illegal publishers employed several methods of production: silk screen printing, offset printing machines, and, for those who were more daring, sneaking into university offices by night to use the copy machine.
“There is a whole generation of people in Poland who have eye problems,” quips Anna Baranczak, with whom I took three classes with during my freshman and sophomore years. She is sitting in her airy third floor office in the Barker Center. Her floor-to-ceiling bookshelves are crammed with Polish novels and poetry anthologies. A few were printed by the “samizdat,” and among them is a collection of her husband’s earlier poetry. The title, “Wiersze Prawie Zebrane”(“The Almost Collected Poems”), runs down the yellowed card stock cover, parallel to the spine. A grainy image of Baranczak—holding a cane and wearing a tweed blazer and the oversized glasses typical of the 1980s—looks as if it was cut out by hand and pasted onto the original cover.
Producing literature was dangerous work in those days. Control of media and art was a cornerstone of government policy in the Polish People’s Republic. Officials censored arts and letters in order to make Polish citizens more intellectually and emotionally amenable to the new totalitarian regime. “Of course we were harassed by the police. We were stalked, we were arrested, but somehow the works were made,” Wolynski says. Baranczak’s poem “Three Magi” puns its eponymous Christmastime lore to describe a nighttime visit from government officials: “They will probably come just after the new year.As usual, early in the morning.
The forceps of the doorbell will pull you out by the headfrom under the bedclothes; dazed as a newborn baby,you’ll open the door. The star of an IDwill flash before your eyes.Three men. In one of them you’ll recognizewith sheepish amazement (isn’t this a smallworld) your schoolmate of years ago.”
The black mark left by Baranczak’s dismissal from Adam Mickiewicz faded away on August 31, 1980, when striking Polish dock workers from the northern port city Gdansk won major concessions from the country’s iron-fisted political regime: the right to organize independent unions able to strike, greater religious freedom, and, most significant to Baranczak, greater freedom of expression.
Poles were ecstatic, Anna recalls. “We were so incredibly aware that history was being made,” she says. Baranczak was so euphoric himself that he tried out his son’s skateboard, which turned out to be an impetuous decision, since Baranczak, instead of gliding around Poznan, ended up breaking his leg. The event that spurred  his accident also prompted a flood of requests for Baranczak to give readings. Hobbling into a reading with a broken leg gave Baranczak—falsely—the look of a hardened political dissident. “The Communists broke his leg,” audience members often whispered, Anna remembers.
Baranczak, like other Polish poets writing during the 20th century, was a reluctant political figurehead. Poland had lost much of its intelligentsia during World War II, Wolynski says, so few intellectuals of the post-war era were willing to continue the tradition epitomized by Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz, who fought for Polish freedom during the 19th century. “Nobody wanted to be a martyr. Only idiots wanted to be a martyr,” Wolynski says. “It was like we were pushed, pressed to be active politically.”
For Baranczak, poetry was at its most basic the expression of an individual. According to Wolynski, Anna Baranczak, and Associate Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures Joanna Nizynska, humanistic personal philosophies and a deep commitment to the truth drove him to resistance organizing. In “Temporary Shortages,” a poem written during the 1970s, Baranczak explores how communist censorship and cultural policies affected the mind:
“…our apartments
have been replaced by departments; what’s happened
to our brains:
we’ve gone
too far, we’ve bred
silence into our brains, we’ve
brought up our brains
in silence, we’ve buried
our brains in silence; now
our brains are wise because they don’t talk that much,
they don’t talk that much, because they’re not that much alive.”
Despite the political undertones of this poem and its appropriation of the collective “we,” Baranczak was unwilling to become the “political martyr,” as his wife put it, that the crowd in the chapel wanted him to become. His steadfast individualism overrode any of the collectivist impulses his early poetry may have suggested. “He couldn’t stand having this political popularity,” Anna says. “Politics means to use we, and he was committed to I.”
A thirst for truth, rather than politics or activism, provided an impetus for Baranczak’s more political poetry. In a 1986 interview with the American Poetry Review, Baranczak explained how representing what a poet felt to be real or accurate could be seen as a political act. “Even writing on, say, flowers, or love can be—doesn’t necessarily have to be, but it can be—a political gesture, if it’s written in the spirit of defending your right to be independent,” Baranczak said. “Just pure description, if it describes the world faithfully, is a kind of political act.”
Baranczak’s poetry from this period attempted to demystify the government’s control over the Polish people by showing how  propaganda embedded politics in day-to-day life. “What he was doing in his poetry was that he was using colloquial speech to reveal various mechanisms of mystique of the communist regime and show how the communist regime manipulates language,” Nizynska says. “And he revealed those mechanisms by going back to everyday reality.” In his poetry, Baranczak attempts to expose the dual consciousness imposed by communist censorship. Because individuals’ minds were divided in two, between what they could and could not say, Baranczak’s alternating use of propagandist language and vernacular language can be read as a political statement.
Baranczak’s poem “A Special Time” exemplifies his reappropriation of oblique communist-speak to reveal underlying truths:
“We live at a special time (clears throat) and that
we must, isn’t that the truth, be clearly.
Aware of. We live at (splashes water
into his glass) a special, isn’t that the truth,
time, at a time of
continuous efforts on behalf of, at a
time of increasing and sharpening
and so on (slurps water), isn’t that the truth  Conflicts.”
ELLA’S HOME
In March 1978, Professor Emeritus Donald Fanger, a former Chair of the Slavic Languages and Literatures Department, carried Harvard stationary in his luggage when he flew across the Atlantic Ocean, passed through the veil of the invisible Iron Curtain, and landed in Poland. He had come to meet, and potentially hire, Baranczak to teach Polish literature at Harvard. Fanger was impressed with the out-of-work poet, and after their discussion, he asked Baranczak if he wanted a one-year, three-year, or five-year contract. The two immediately signed the three-year contract,  drawn up on Fanger’s stationary, in the American Embassy in Warsaw.
It took time for the Baranczaks, like many immigrants, to adjust to the American landscape. In his essay “E.E.: The Extraterritorial,” Baranczak makes light of the differences between Eastern Europe’s dull grays and America’s “orgy of colors.” American gulls are bigger too, as if “they had been fed all their lives with some especially nutritious gull food, sold in easy-to-open cans,” he quips, demonstrating the wry sense of humor that friends recall.
Exile was a prevalent theme among the poets of post-war Poland. Many fled to Paris or America in order to practice their art without political ramifications. Baranczak’s own immigration to the United States was delayed three years as the Polish government wouldn’t allow the professor to leave the country because officials feared the dissident would stir up anti-government sentiment abroad. It was only after University affiliates, including then-president Derek C. Bok, plied the Polish government with numerous letters that Baranczak was allowed to travel.
Though acclimating to a different cultural climate took Baranczak some time, he was not a reluctant exile. He welcomed his move to the land he and his wife were so curious about, the “land of Ella Fitzgerald and Emily Dickinson,” Anna says. Baranczak’s poem “Don’t Use the Word ‘Exile’” argues against using the term “exile” because “it’s improper and senseless.” For Baranczak, “you yourself left them behind, selfishly forsaken / even as you set foot on the curb or entered the station, / because with every moment one chooses another life.” Furthermore, Wolynski says, Baranczak “lived to work,” and in America, Baranczak could escape the political upheaval for which he had no desire to act as poet-spokesman.
The poems of Baranczak that have been translated into English, Nizynska says, would give readers a narrow impression that does not reflect the corpus of his work. His earlier poetry features an overt anti-communist sentiment, but Baranczak’s later, more metaphysical work shows the poet at his full height and demonstrates his reluctance to engage with the political. As he matured as a poet, Baranczak played with his native language more, she says.
Beyond poetry and politics, translations were important to Baranczak. His most significant contribution to Polish literature is perhaps his translation of the complete works of Shakespeare. Shakespeare’s plays have been translated into Polish before, but Baranczak translated the work with unique sensitivity to the plays’ theatrical elements. However, Fanger, who worked with Baranczak for about two decades, says Baranczak is a poet and writer first.
“I’ve never met anybody who lived so completely and so insistently and so intensely by the written word,” Fanger says. “He was always good to talk to, but his manner was quiet in speech, almost shy. But he could do anything on the page.”
And yet, while Parkinson’s has stolen Baranczak’s ability to write and severely limited his ability to speak, Wolynski believes that Baranczak is still working with words, as he has for his entire life: “If [Baranczak] can’t work, he’s very unhappy,” Wolynski says. “The disease of course stopped him. But in reality, he’s still working in his head. It doesn’t matter that he cannot now even operate the computer. He is still working.”

Star Ash
Oct. 5-6, 11-13 8:00 p.m., Oct. 7 2:00p.m.
Loeb Ex
Directed by Sara Batista-Pereira ‘13
Produced by Cassandra Rasmussen ‘13 and Sasha G. Miranov ’13
“Star Ash” is the tale of a tale, an exploration of the boundaries between reality and legend. It centers on the discoveries made by a young woman named Jenny about her family history and a story passed down by her female ancestors. Playwright Cassandra L. Rasmussen ’13 was inspired to delve into these themes by her own love of fairy tales: “I wanted to write a story about a story that changes over generations,” she says.
“We want to take the audience into this family,” says Kathleen S. O’Beirne ’15, who plays Eva—one of Jenny’s ancestors—in the production. Indeed, the audience may well experience a diverse array of storytelling techniques as the actors use variety of media to communicate the themes of the productions. Shadow plays—recalling early cinema—will be used to illustrate the shifts between physical and ethereal worlds as Jenny’s ancestors enter, yet remain separate from, concrete reality.
However, “Star Ash” does not just use visual techniques to explore these themes. The show works to emphasize the performative nature of traditional story telling. Weaving a tale is an important aspect of this production, with actors learning the techniques involved with storytelling, from cadence to movement.
The boundary between fairytale and reality is fluid within the play. Choreographer Xi Yu, ’13, a Crimson editor, sees herself as more of a “movement director” than as someone who strictly focuses on dance. “What it is is, how do these actors naturally move, and how do we make it more specific and coach them how to tell the story and enhance the meaning of the lines,” she says. These dances appear in the fairytale scenes, as the actors communicate the story to the audience. “Dance is a big part of a lot of aural traditions,” says director Sara Batista-Pereira ’13. “That came into play almost immediately.”
“The collaboration has really brought it to life,” says Rasmussen of the development of her work through the creative process form writing to production. Indeed, the nature of theatre as a collaborative form of storytelling, is a definitive part of the play, which is so concerned with the connective power of a story. Batista-Pereira advises viewers to keep an open mind: “I want them to be surprised.”

Cheating Death
Oct. 4-6, 7:30 p.m.,
Oct. 6 2:30pm, 7:30 p.m.
Adams Pool Theatre
Directed by Will H. Ryan ’14. and Sam S. Richardson ’15
Produced by Katherine L. Price ’14, Brenna K. McDuffie ’14 and My N. C. To ’15
A hard-hitting show made up of two one-act plays, “Cheating Death” presents two very different performances that share a common idea: the loss of control. “Stingers” and “The Immoralist”—the two shows that make up the production—touch on some familiar themes, such as the generational divide, familial upheaval, and the ultimate struggle to find personal balance in the world. Both plays are also student-written, The  first by Andy J. Boyd ’14 and the second  by Will H. Ryan ’14.
Boyd’s “Stingers” revolves around complex interfamilial battles that lead to two children putting their father on trial in their living room to condemn his merciless parenting. “Those tones started to interest me more—the sort of delusion of someone who won’t let go of power,” says Boyd. The strong-headed daughter Nina (Camille Z. Coppola ’14) wrestles with her bitterness toward her demanding father. Coppola draws a parallel between the struggles her character faces and the sense of resentment students sometimes feel toward their overbearing parents. “I feel at least at Harvard that one of the major themes that students can connect to is the academic infiltration of their lives at the expense of emotion. That’s something my character certainly deals with,” she says.
By contrast, Ryan’s “The Immoralist” centers on a young, well-off couple who discover that the husband has cancer. Ryan based his play off of a novel published in 1902 of the same name by André Gide but added new conflicts and characters to ensure that modern audiences will connect to the play’s overarching themes. Ari D. Brenner ’14 plays Gill, whom he describes as a typical confident Harvard guy enjoying a successful career. “He’s got his boxes checked across the board…. This hugely life-changing event, getting sick as he does, really throws off whatever grasp he did have of who he is and where he’s trying to get in life,” says Brenner. This inner conflict drives what Ryan describes as the main theme of the play, the difficulty of letting go of a false sense of control. “The book’s answer is that...you should have responsibilities and you should constrain your desires, and that’s more or less where the play ends up as well,” says Ryan.
Despite the heavy themes, both plays try to find the humor in terrible life circumstances.  “Cheating Death”  allows two young writers to experiment with the inherent comedy and tragedy found in family life.

“Tonight, you hold this show in your hands…or rather, your feet.” This is an unusual message, but one that draws attention to the peculiar nature of “Sequence 8,” a performance by the French-Canadian circus company “7 Doigts de la Main” that runs at the Cutler Majestic Theatre at Emmerson College through October 7. There is no formal plot; it is much more about acrobatic flips than narrative turns. The production takes clowning’s precedent of gaudy pastiche and smashes it into pieces, bringing forth a show that connects an otherwise surreal performance to everyday human experience.
The show starts with an acrobatic dance from all eight of the performers, who energetically jump at the audience, highlighting the performances slanted and moving lines. Next comes the russian bar—a type of flexible balance beam—which is used to launch one of the female acrobats 20 or 30 feet into the air. This is followed by a routine by world-renowned cigar box juggler Eric Bates, who took three otherwise mundane objects and whirled them around the stage in a truly stupefying display of talent.
It is the music that helped draw the emotional content out of the performance. Seth Stachowski and Nans Bortuzzo—responsible for original music and remixing, respectively—deftly marry the visuals to the sound that accompanied and amplified it. The music in the show ranges from contemporary compositions that fill the theater with sweeping and powerful tones, to the vivacious or gloomy tones of artists like “The Mountain Goats” or “C2C.” The importance of the music becomes clear in a beautiful section in the second half of the show featuring Alexandra Royer, one of the two female acrobats, performing her specialty aerial hoop routine. Royer’s talent is unmistakable, but the music is what fleshed out the power of the movement in the show: Her display is given a sense of nuance by her interaction with the music and bridges the gap between circus and dance.
Given the acrobatic nature of the performance, the set was relatively sparse: just a collection boxes, a desk, a lamp, and a bunch of hanging frames. However, the lighting design of the show, done by Nol Van Genuchten, was very complex and  was integral in transforming these performers in to emotional characters. For example, the bright lights in the Bate’s cigar-box toss, juxtaposed against the deep purple of Royer’s hoop scene, helped to create a sense of individual character and emotional evolution.
The acts were brief, so the show was filled with small skits in between each act. These were mostly comic interludes usually contrasted with the acrobatic routine that preceded them and were consequently a bit disorienting. The goal was most likely to brighten the mood after darker moments, but it seemed forced and broke the overall flow of the piece. The show could perhaps be strengthened by a larger narrative structure that integrated these little skits into the larger picture and made them vehicles for a smooth transition between acrobatic acts.
However, this small drawback of the production pales in comparison to the resounding success it has in the one thing that matters most: creating an emotionally resonant piece of art. “7 Doigts de la Main” has done a remarkable job of creating a circus with a twist: one that dazzles with both its technical expertise and its ability to access broader human emotion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, The Crimson reported that some students in Quincy and the surrounding houses were distressed by the loud noises of construction that often woke them up or bothered them as early as 8 a.m. As Harvard embarks on the decades-long project of House renewal, it is inevitable that this concern will come up again and again as further houses are reconstructed.
Although we sympathize with students losing sleep, we also understand that it’s necessary for construction work to take place in the daylight hours. If the construction were to wait to begin until 10 a.m., when most students are out of the Houses and at class, each renewal project would drag on longer and be much more expensive. That cost is simply not worth saving a bit of noise. Students who are truly concerned about noise at 8 a.m. should perhaps consider choosing rooms farther away from construction in the future; in the short term, they can close their storm windows tightly or pick up a pair of ear plugs.
Of course, there are ways in which the University and Houses could make life a little easier for students waking up in the morning—and make 8 a.m. not seem quite as early. For example, right now, the majority of Harvard’s classes take place between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. This not only makes course scheduling more difficult than necessary, but also ignores the fact that many students wake up much earlier than 10 (and that many others would prefer to take classes in the afternoon). If there were classes and sections available that met earlier in the morning, students waking up at 7:30 could head to class long before construction even started. Of course, making popular classes or required classes meet this early would undoubtedly be unfavorable among students who like to sleep in. Nonetheless, a greater variety of time slots for course offerings would allow early risers to take advantage of small class settings as well as peaceful sleep.
Other than this, students in affected Houses should be able to propose other ways in which the University could do a better job of accommodating students bothered by the noise of construction. For example, although this wouldn’t save anyone sleep, we would like to have a better idea of what exactly is going on in the construction site on a day-to-day basis.
But it’s ultimately important that we get serious about the real issues at play here. If Quincy House and Harvard’s construction plans are determined to wake students up hours before their classes begin, it is an absolute injustice—perhaps even an outrage—to continue to deny them hot breakfast in their home dining halls. And by hot breakfast, we don’t just mean oatmeal and hard-boiled, but something much more assorted and complex. Unfortunately, the administration seems to have made up its mind not to consider the possibility of restoring easily accessible bacon and French toast to upperclass Houses. As we have pointed out many times before, the lack of hot breakfast is totally and utterly unfair. Especially in these exceptional times, Harvard should really, really, really think of ways to bring back hot breakfast to the Houses.
Being rudely awoken before one’s alarm clock can be a frustrating and exhausting experience, especially for college students who may be getting less sleep than they should be already (and for those who can’t even experience the simple human pleasure of eating scrambled eggs with their toast in the morning). However, we remain confident that with a few accommodations made by the university, students should not have to view construction sites near their homes with antipathy.
Of course, there will always be those who object to waking up at 8 a.m. The Crimson is not your mother, but we would like to give this one piece of advice to any students worried about losing sleep over the Quincy construction: Go to bed earlier.

While the thesis experience may very well be the bane of a senior’s existence until March, a thesis can also be an incredible opportunity to travel to a new place, research a unique question specific to one’s interests, and interview people with fascinating stories to tell. This past summer, while I was in Mozambique doing thesis research at a rural primary school, some of my classmates were scattered around the globe doing thesis research.
Tyler E. Logigian ’13, concentrating in social studies, was just a country away from me doing thesis research on public health policy in post-apartheid South Africa. “I'm looking into whether the activism that developed around South Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic has created a political space that other health issues can use to engage with the government and affect policy changes: services, access, research funding.” Though only in South Africa for one month, Logigian was able to get all of his primary research done. “I found that my first interview participants helped tremendously in guiding my project, putting me into touch with useful contacts of theirs.”
Farther up the continent’s western coast, history and literature concentrator Sydney A. H. Sawyier ’13 was leafing through the Cameroonian national archives for her thesis. “Initially I intended to do a comparative study of women's involvement in independence-era political parties of Cameroon and Morocco,” Sawyier explains. Then she was forced to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. “Well, the national archives of Morocco—despite all previous communications—were closed for construction, and then I fell ill, so I completed no useful research in Morocco.” Cameroon also proved difficult in its own right. “Cameroon's national archives were an organizational disaster, not to mention split between two cities five hours away from one another by bus.”
During her time in Cameroon, Sawyier became interested in the influence and internal political dynamics of communism on the Union des Populations du Cameroun, the most active nationalist independent party in pre- and immediately post-independence Cameroon. Though she set out with different research questions in mind, she is now focusing on the relationship between the UPC and the French Communist party and the emergence of a broader worker consciousness in French West Africa.
Just north of Africa, social studies concentrator Ariella E. Rotenberg ’13 was conducting her thesis research in Israel, where she spent the previous seven months studying abroad. “Few people know that 20 percent of Israeli citizens are actually Arabs, most of whom consider themselves to be ethnically Palestinian.” Rotenberg explains. “This group of people are entitled to and receive Israeli citizenship because they are born inside the borders of the State of Israel.” She interviewed university students from this demographic across the country to learn more about the way they view the relationship between their Israeli citizenship and their Palestinian identity. Her findings? “Many of them expressed the feeling that they did not fully belong to either group: Palestinians or Israelis.” Interviewing university students like herself in another part of the world was Rotenberg’s favorite part of her thesis research. “I was inspired by the way students my age thought deeply and often about their conflicting identities.” She reflects, “I cannot help but feel lucky to have had the chance to listen to and understand a little bit about what these students face each and every day.”
Across the world in Brazil, environmental science and public policy concentrator Arturo A. Villanueva ’13 conducted quantitative research on water development in South America and Africa while also talking with small-scale farmers, government officials, and private companies. “I took Environmental Science and Public Policy 10 with Professor John Briscoe. That class totally revolutionized the way I think about our natural resources, particularly water,” he notes. Villanueva’s thesis will analyze various financial models that are used to finance large irrigation projects in order to determine which models have been successful and which have not.
Although writing a thesis isn’t for everyone, many who do decide to take it on reap many benefits. “I have the chance to dig into complex subject matter over an extended period of time and eventually produce a piece of originally-researched academic writing. That, for me, will be the perfect culmination of my Harvard undergraduate education,” Rotenberg states. Theses can also give students a better idea of what they want to do after college. As Logigian notes, “I think that writing my thesis this year will help me determine whether or not I'd like to go into academia, and also whether or not I'd like to continue studying South African civil society.”
Even though there will be lots of blood, sweat, and tears in the months leading up to the deadline, the experiences students have had conducting research in the field provide invaluable skills, contacts, and memories that will last long after their theses are turned in.

Last week The Crimson staff published an opinion piece stating that divesting university endowments from fossil fuel companies is a tactic too extreme to be used in the fight against global warming.  According to The Crimson, Harvard has “divested only a few times in the past, and has done so predominantly in instances of human rights abuses being linked to their investments.” That is to say, The Crimson believes that climate change isn’t a human rights issue.
 
 The Crimson must learn the basics of the climate crisis and its impact on our world before publishing such an article. The world’s foremost experts on human rights have long acknowledged that these issues are at the very core of the climate crisis: The United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution in 2008 stating that “climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights.” 
 
 William E. McKibben ’82, former President of The Crimson, of 350.org told a Sanders Theater audience on Thursday that South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu had called global warming the human rights issue of our time and urged a massive divestment campaign. Tutu, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the South African anti-apartheid struggle, says his continent is being devastated by droughts which have only intensified with climate change—despite the fact that most Africans contribute very little emissions and have done almost nothing to cause global warming. 
 
 Andrew C. Revkin, another speaker at Sanders on Thursday, posted on his New York Times blog that the Earth is expected to have a carrying capacity of 1 billion people if we continue to emit greenhouse gases at our current rate. That means that six out of every seven people currently on this planet will be dead if we do not stop global warming. Is this not an issue of human rights? Moreover, the majority of these deaths will likely occur in developing countries that have done little to cause climate change. Superpowers like the U.S. have been polluting for decades, ignoring the consequences of our actions—and now innocent people will pay the price with their lives. How is this just? 
 
 Clearly climate change is a mammoth human rights abuse and a deep injustice. The facts demand bold action for all humanity. We have already caused the Earth’s temperature to rise by 0.8 degrees Celsius. This has resulted in freakish weather across the globe, from the massive wildfires that devoured Colorado this summer, to the drought currently driving Midwest farmers to ruin, which has caused world food prices to increase 10 percent. 
 
 Even if we somehow stop emitting greenhouse gases today, global temperatures would likely rise another 0.8 degrees because of the planet’s slow feedback systems. The UN optimistically designates 2 degrees C as the “safe” limit for planetary warming, but current trends of fossil fuel use and expansion put us on track for a 6 degree temperature rise—literally, hell on earth—before the end of the century. 
 
 Globally, we can emit only 565 Gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere without breaking that two degree limit. Yet fossil fuel companies hold a terrifying 2795 Gigatons of carbon in their proven reserves. Thus, to avoid irreversible climate catastrophe, we need to keep 80 percent of those reserves locked underground. Are fossil fuel corporations going to willingly concede 80 percent of their expected profits to prevent climate disaster? Of course not. While the technological solutions to the climate crisis are ready and waiting, fossil fuel corporations have corrupted our political system and made it impossible to pass even the weakest legislative efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It is time for us to attack the root of this problem: the companies themselves. 
 
Divesting our endowment from fossil fuel corporations is not merely a logical response to the threat of global warming. It is the only moral response to a global human rights crisis and the only way to uphold the values of our Harvard community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The title of the tax alludes to its ethos: taking from the rich and giving to the poor. After months of pressure from nurses, health care, labor, environmental and faith-based activists, the Robin Hood Tax—a type of Financial Transaction Tax—has taken the next step towards become a reality. But there is a long road ahead. On Friday, September 14, Representative Keith M. Ellison (D-Minn.) introduced a bill, HR-6411 “The Inclusive Prosperity Act,” in Congress that would place a tiny tax on Wall Street.
The bill begins, “To impose a tax on certain trading transaction to strengthen our financial security, expand opportunity, and stop shrinking the middle class.” The idea is simple: in the wake of the financial crisis, Wall Street received a major bailout, while many social safety net, infrastructure, and other programs are struggling to provide vital services that millions rely on. The tax places a levy of less than half of one percent on big financial transactions including the trade of stocks, bonds, derivatives, and foreign currencies. Economist Robert N. Pollin, co-director of the Political Economy Research Institute explains the basis of an FTT: “It would mean that financial market traders would pay a small fee to the government every time they purchased any financial market instrument. This would be the equivalent of sales taxes that Americans have long paid every time they buy an automobile, shirt, baseball glove, airline ticket, or pack of chewing gum, eat at a restaurant, or have their hair cut.”
The Robin Hood Tax has the potential to raise up to $350 billion in annual revenues that could then be directed toward various social programs both domestically and globally. The money from this tax could go toward creating jobs, strengthening health care and education infrastructure, and investing in clean energy in the U.S., while establishing funding for programs to fight AIDS, poverty, and climate problems abroad.
This would not be the first time that the United States has had a financial transaction tax. The U.S. had a transfer tax in place from 1914 to 1966 that put a 0.2 percent tax on the sales and transfers of stocks. The tax was doubled in 1932 to assist in overcoming the budgetary challenges imposed by the Great Depression. The tax disappeared in 1966 when lawmakers repealed it in an effort to streamline the tax system.
More than 40 nations are currently reaping the benefits of an FTT and using the revenue to finance a variety of services, while suffering few or no financial repercussion as a result.
The bill just introduced in the House by Ellison was assigned to the House Committee on Ways and Means. The bill has 10 cosponsors, including Representative James P. McGovern (D-Mass.). However, it must secure more political backing in order to become a reality.
Money raised from the FTT would be spread over a range of endeavors—from expanding resources for state and federal investments that protect health, physical infrastructure, and jobs to funding international prosperity programs such as climate change and AIDS treatment and prevention programs. The tax has wide appeal and should be an exciting prospect for organizations that have faced budget cuts in the midst of the financial crisis, and for students and young professionals who care deeply about social and humanitarian issues.
Today, the Robin Hood National Day of Action, activists from around the Boston area will rally outside the office of Representative Michael E. Capuano (D-Mass.), who represents all of Cambridge, to ask him to co-sign the current bill aiming to implement a Robin Hood Tax, HR-6411.
Capuano’s history of support for universal healthcare, affordable housing, improved educational opportunities and funding, and international peacekeeping show that his interests are in line with those of the tax. He was a staunch advocate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, has fought for increased Section 8 housing, and has built himself up as a champion of peace and development in the aftermath of the genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan.
Capuano himself agrees that “we remain too far from the goal of ‘universal access, zero disparities’” in the realm of domestic healthcare. Supporting the Robin Hood Tax provides Capuano a unique opportunity to stand up for the values he so clearly professes and to ensure that vital programs get the funding they so desperately need.
As members of the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition, we have a particular interest in the tax, which could go to funding global AIDS programs that have received far too little attention in the U.S. budget in recent years. We now have the tools we need to eradicate the AIDS epidemic and the Robin Hood Tax could ensure that we invest the necessary resources to bring about its eradication. Health activists are not pressing Capuano for a radical change in his politics. He is simply being called to stand up for a tax that would unite his domestic and international interests through the broader vision of global health and social welfare. If all goes well on today, Capuano just might be our Robin Hood.

“Trees and lawns become more distinct.Philosophies one after another go out.Everything is lighter yet not less odd.” — Czeslaw Milosz
Affliction: Last semester I overdosed on German writers. My descent began innocently with Rainer Maria Rilke’s “Letters to a Young Poet” and hit existential rock bottom with Nietzsche’s “Human, All Too Human.” Forays into Camus and Kierkegaard, rather than slowing my fall, accelerated the process.
It had begun innocuously enough. Attempting to negotiate my feelings, I initially turned to Rilke, who prescribed me a retreat into solitude and the self. Following this course of action, I found my enabler in Herman Hesse—the author of “Steppenwolf”—a man who felt himself profoundly incapable of being in and conforming to the world. A long period of Nietzsche ensued. I have to warn you, embroiling yourself in the thoughts of a man who describes his own writings as “melancholy-valiant”—who dedicates his words to readers he fervently believes to be non-existent and imaginary—is a rather fraught experience.
By summer, I was well in the throes of solipsism, taking the hardline view that nothing existed outside of the mind—thus denying as valid the reality of other minds, other people, and the world at large. At better moments, I allowed that the world was probably real, but remained a skeptic regarding the possibility of true human connection. I was running out of options—there was no more philosophy to turn to—and I lacked the ability to digest any more Nietzschean aphorisms. More importantly, while I was profoundly introspecting, my friends and family were profoundly sick and tired of my introspection. These were dire times. An intervention was called, a confrontation conducted. The outcome was a recognition of my unacceptable state of affairs. The solution was the problem. Too much of a certain medicine could be poisonous. It was time to get a second opinion.
Recovery:Help from on high came from a rather unlikely source. You would think that an author known for his philosophical background, his meta-fictional digressions, and “Infinite Jest,” a thousand-plus-page novel on modern-day addiction, couldn’t possibly be a solipsist’s saving grace. David Foster Wallace’s characters are themselves frequently afflicted by medical and metaphorical addictions. They too, are often detached from the world or at least at deep unease. In the worlds of Wallace’s fiction, thinking often leads to paralysis: a character’s recursive collapse into his own interiority. And the more hyper-intellectualized and abstracted the thinking, the more problematic this is shown to be. I guess reading Wallace didn’t seem to bode all that well for my prognosis.
I was quite wrong. Indeed, my summer period of recovery was almost entirely due to D.F.W. You see, the more I read of Wallace, the more I came to understand that, for him, solipsism was the enemy. His characters were flawed and difficult precisely because Wallace wanted to puncture the walls of the solipsistic mind and urge readers to aim to go beyond the self, beyond one’s own thoughts, toward empathy and morality and being in and of the world.
Relapse:This semester I relapsed. The word “relapse” is often used in reference to medical pathology: my inability to shrug off solipsism can be considered in those terms. Moments of Sartrean nausea struck me unbidden: by the Charles River, sitting in a busy dining hall, sometimes even while talking to someone else. Last week, in the middle of an argument with a friend I jumped on his use of the word “dialectic” and turned the conversation into a not-so-clever consideration of Hegelian dialectics. Terrible idea. We haven’t spoken since. I really needed to kick this German writer-habit.
One More Try:The word “relapse” has its British origins in the denouncement of heresy with the Latin word relapsus, which refers to relapsed heretics. I, I confess, have been heretical. There is nothing wrong with German philosophy, or philosophizing in general. The writers I have overdosed on are good writers, whose ideas deserve much careful and dedicated thought. But it is misguided and in bad faith—mauvaise foi—to consider theory and abstraction solipsistically, or in a manner detached from the world.
The etymology of “relapse” also suggests, in part, its antidote. A little known usage of the word “relapse” is relapse as renouncement. Not that I’m renouncing the world of ideas—it would be difficult to, given that I major in the history of ideas. But I’ve come to recognize that world as one I cannot always reside in, and that living fully and presently in the extra-mental world is what I should aim towards. It comes down to being human, all too human perhaps, but I’ve found that what it’s all about is not “the self,”—other selves—my family and friends whose goodness, love, and wisdom are the things most real to me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In this fall’s Modern Hebrew 120a: “Intermediate Modern Hebrew” course, digital apps and iPads have replaced paper flash cards and textbooks. In collaboration with Harvard’s Academic Technology Group, Irit Aharony, the head of Harvard’s Modern Hebrew Studies Program, has created a digital textbook on iBooks for use in her second-year language class.
 
Some of the functions on the digital textbook include interactive exercises and vocabulary flashcards, as well as stories in Hebrew that students can read as they listen along to the audio recording.
 
According to Aharony, Intermediate Modern Hebrew is the only class at Harvard that exclusively uses a digital textbook via iPad. To equip students for access to their coursework, Harvard has loaned iPads to all nine students in the class. Students use the iPad for both homework assignments and in-class activities.
 
Elette C. Boyle, a graduate student at MIT who cross-registered for the class, said this is her first time using an iPad.
 
“It took me a little while to get used to the iPad, but it’s a great tool that I can take anywhere, like a coffee shop,” Boyle said. “I also get immediate feedback on my work.”
 
Aharony said the idea of integrating technology in her classroom emerged last year when she saw students who were simultaneously talking on their phones and flipping paper flashcards on their way to class.
 
As she watched them pass by, Aharony said she remembered thinking, “Why do they need both tools? Why not combine them?”
 
The desire to allow her students to use the study material on their devices, coupled with the need to go greener, prompted Aharony to make the switch first to an online flashcard program and ultimately to a digital textbook on iPad.
 
Incorporating new technology, however, has presented some challenges as well. Osnat Aharoni, the teaching assistant for the course, said that the specific nature of Hebrew has presented unique technical problems. The application has to grapple with two languages read in opposite directions—Hebrew from right to left, and English from left to right—and a system of diacritical marks.
 
“It creates an extra ten-fold level of difficulty for the technical team,” Aharoni said, crediting Kevin Guiney and Bill Barthelmy from the Academic Technology Group for all their hard work.
 
Eventually, Aharony said she hopes to use animation for her study materials.
 
“Having animations pop out as students read in Hebrew—that’s my fantasy,” she said. “For now, we are learning as we go along and improving how we can better present the work for the students.”
 
Aharoni added that the students in the class, who range from undergraduates to graduate students from MIT and Harvard, have become as much a part of the development team as the teachers and the IT team.
 
“They are helping to debug the program throughout the course,” she said.
 
Aharony, who is in her 40th year of teaching, said the education scene has changed completely since she came to Harvard in 1996. Back then, Aharony recalls having to make copies of tapes so that her students can listen to Israeli music and individually calling them when she needed to make an announcement after class. Now, everything is posted immediately on the course iSite.
 
“Technology has changed everything,” she said “It changed life.”
 
Yet, Aharony said that one thing remains constant. “The students are still very involved in the language and eager to learn,” she said. “That certainly hasn’t changed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two months of renovation, The Boathouse, a recently rebranded pub and grill, opened last week in the space at 49 Mt. Auburn St. formerly occupied by the bistro Trata.
Brendan J. Hopkins, who owned and operated both restaurants with his brother, said the two decided to move away from the restaurant model toward a more casual and laid-back pub atmosphere.
“We just decided to do a rebrand,” he said.
Hopkins said he was immediately drawn to the rowing theme as a way to insert part of his personal history into the restaurant’s identity. Hopkins and his brother grew up in Galway, Ireland, where they lived on the banks of a river and rowed as children.
His experience as a rower and Cambridge’s location on the Charles River made a rowing theme particularly appealing to both brothers, he said.
The new menu of the pub was inspired by the brothers’ Irish heritage. The Boathouse now serves traditional Irish pub fare, including standbys like fish and chips and bangers and mash, and also offers American options including pulled pork sandwiches and fish tacos.
“We try to put the best, freshest ingredients in everything we make,” Hopkins said.
Hopkins said that the new restaurant fills a need in the Square for more traditional pubs that focus on drinks and reasonably priced food.
The Boathouse’s menu has no entrees that cost more than $14. Most appetizers range from $5 to $7.
The restaurant also has an extensive selection of beers, including six on tap and sixteen other bottled options, many from microbreweries in the area.
Today, the restaurant has a 26-foot scull from the 1930s along one wall and old-fashioned steering wheels mounted on other surfaces. Other cosmetic renovations altered the floors, lighting, and paint to create the warm space with open space to facilitate mingling.
Hopkins said he hopes that the nautical décor will attract the visitors that flock to Harvard Square for the regattas on the Charles each year, including the Head of the Charles, which begins on Oct. 20. Hopkins also said he hopes that the restaurant’s central location near Harvard’s river houses will attract students and their families.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of Harvard affiliates called on student service members to facilitate conversations with their peers about the role of the military at a welcome ceremony for veterans currently attending the University Monday night.
 
“Let there be no doubt that when you walk into Harvard—and that includes family members as well—you are the military at Harvard,” said Director of the National Security Program at Harvard Kennedy School Tad J. Oelstrom. “You are the military so what you bring to the Harvard community in fact is an education for and a representation of the United States military.”
 
The event attracted a large crowd of veterans to the Harvard Faculty Club—a venue choice that is testament to the importance Harvard has given to the military.
 
The presence of the armed services has increased at Harvard in recent years. The University officially welcomed back the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps in September of last year after a nearly 40 year absence. The following semester, Harvard recognized Army SROTC as well.
 
There are 15 undergraduates currently enrolled in Naval ROTC, 10 in Army SROTC, and four in Air Force ROTC. Many veterans and current service members also attend Harvard’s graduate schools.
 
The military’s newfound prominence on campus is often attributed to University President Drew G. Faust’s desire to improve the relations between Harvard and the armed services. Faust, who grew up in a military family, often lauds the military as a valuable public service.
 
“You and all your colleagues who have been deployed and could not join us today deserve our recognition and gratitude for your devotion to the noble work of supporting and defending the constitution,” Faust said. “We are very proud to call...each of you members of the Harvard community.”
 
Travis J. Belanger ’14, a Marine veteran, said that the event itself was indicative of the military’s prominence at Harvard.
 
“This is fantastic,” said Belanger, who also works as the Co-President of Crimson Serves, of the event. “It’s another sign that Harvard is really changing the way it deals with the military.”
 
HKS Senior Lecturer Linda J. Bilmes said that Harvard students often are unacquainted with service members, which creates barriers to mutual understanding. According to Bilmes, the three most common responses to army veteran are a sense a befuddlement, guilt, and a sense of appreciation and awe.
 
She encouraged veterans to have meaningful discussions with Harvard students about service and to serve as “ambassadors of the military” on campus.
“There is a wonderful thing that can help you do this, spelled B-E-E-R,” she said, prompting laughter.
 
According to Kennedy School Professor Meghan O’Sullivan, the event’s organizer, this is the second year that Harvard has hosted a welcome event for its veterans.
 
O’Sullivan said she teaches many former veterans who, coming from a structured military environment, find the “lack of hierarchy” at Harvard disorienting. She said she hoped an event like this, which brought together veterans from across the University, would “help explain Harvard to these students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early August, a crowd of protesters began gathering outside the downtown Philadelphia offices of the Federal National Mortgage Association. There were about 50 protesters outside the offices by 1 p.m. lobbying peacefully for the embattled mortgage lender to drop two foreclosure cases, according to local media reports.
By 1:30, a smaller group of protesters had tried to enter the building illegally and started a sit-in in the lobby of an adjacent bank. By 2:30, officials met with two of the protesters facing foreclosure with little success, and, by the end of the day, two of the Green Party’s top organizers, 2012 presidential nominee Jill E. Stein ’72-’73 and her running mate Cheri Honkala, were in jail.
Stein and Honkala were among five arrested and charged Aug. 1 with unlawful entry and conspiracy for a sit-in. As Republican nominee Mitt Romney mulled over his looming vice-presidential pick and President Barack Obama campaigned in Ohio, the Green Party presidential candidate spent the night in jail. The game is rigged against third parties, she meant her actions to say, and it is time somebody did something about it.
“Every effort of the Obama Administration has been to prop this system up and keep it going at taxpayer expense,” Stein said, by way of explaining her protest. “It’s time for this game to end. It’s time for the laws to be written to protect the victims and not the perpetrators. It’s time for a new deal for America, and a Green New Deal is what we will deliver on taking office.”
A Lexington, Mass. physician, Stein is not running to win, but to prove a set of progressive points. Her party has come a long way since Ralph Nader first pushed it onto the national stage more than a decade ago, but Stein knows that in an era of big media and bigger political parties, a poorly-funded third-party candidate with a career in medicine cannot win.
So she attends events like the one in Philadelphia. In mid-September she spoke at Occupy Wall Street’s one-year anniversary. Late in the month she called on supporters to “storm” the Commission on Presidential Debates. She tries, as the Greens always have, to provide an alternative to the two-party system, while forcing its hand.
“It’s not necessarily having someone elected to office, it’s having the third party that drives an agenda forward,” Stein said in an interview with The Crimson. “Sometimes you can win the day without winning office.”
The overwhelming question surrounding the campaign, political experts say: Can Stein push her peripheral third party to the forefront of the political debate with just five weeks until November 6?
From the Grass Up
The Green Party has always faced an uphill battle to find widespread support. Barred from debates and forgotten by mainstream media, 2012 will be no exception. But, in the wake of the Occupy movement and the threat of government shutdown, the political climate might be right for a party that tries to loosen, if only slightly, the hold of the two-party system that dominates the national political landscape—or so Stein hopes.
“We’re in a unique moment now in American history. It’s a moment where I think people realize it is up to us to bring the breaking point to the tipping point,” Stein said.
Stein is unwavering in her policy proposals, which are radical in comparison to either mainstream party. The keystone of her platform is a “Green New Deal” that she says would create 25 million jobs while laying the foundation for a more sustainable economy and environment. Specifically, the plan calls for $700 billion in local investment offset by defense cuts and further health care reform, as well as tax increases for the country’s highest earners.
Without big donors, Stein’s campaign could be described as human-scale. Though it has far-reaching ambitions, the camp is largely grassroots, relying on Twitter and alternative media to get the word out.
Ideologically, the Stein campaign is not unlike its Green Party predecessors, and her own political story echoes that of her party.
First organized in the 1980s, the Green Party was originally a collection of local parties united to advance of environmentalism, non-violence, social justice. With Nader, a Law School graduate, at its helm, the party became better established in the late ’90s and early 2000s.
Like most Greens, Stein’s first involvement with the party was local. As Nader was reaching the zenith of his political career, Stein quietly began hers in 1998 in Lexington, as a citizen advocate for recycling and pollution reduction.
Stein is a Harvard-trained physician—she graduated from Harvard College in 1973 and then Harvard Medical School in 1979—and she says her early involvement in politics was an outcropping of her work as a physician.
“I’m now practicing political medicine, because it’s the mother of all illnesses, and we have to fix this one to fix all the other things that ail us,” Stein said.
Early on, that meant raising awareness about toxic waste and industrial pollution, helping with local projects, and joining the group Physicians for Social Responsibility.
In 2002, she made the leap up from local politics and decided to run for governor of Massachusetts on the Green-Rainbow ticket. Her most memorable opponent: a successful businessman and failed senatorial candidate Mitt Romney.
Stein saw the campaign as a chance to capitalize on Nader’s success nationally and unsettle the two-party balance of party in Massachusetts. Though she ultimately earned just 3.49 percent of the vote—Romney won the election with 49 percent—Stein used the campaign to document the exclusion the two-party system, petitioning for inclusion in debates and election finance reform.
But more importantly, the election put Stein on the national stage. When Nader decided not to run in 2012, Stein was the heir apparent, having had several years of national media attention on programs such as NBC’s “Today.”
Stein says her political career was as unexpected as the movements that inspire it. Her political engagement began in the height of student discontent at Harvard in the late 1960s. As an undergraduate she witnessed Vietnam protests, civil rights rallies, and the storming of University Hall. Though her interests were not always political—“I did not see myself as a political person at all when I was at Harvard,” Stein said—the experience provided the framework that would later shape her political career.
“I think that is what independent politics are all about—the social movements are usually expressions of discontent,” Stein said. “In the ‘60s and the ‘70s it was about Civil Rights and the antiwar movement, and it triggered a lot of creative political thinking at the time.”
Now, Stein says, it is time to capture that discontent once more.
Fighting For Exposure
Third parties have an important but patchworked history in American politics. According to Harvard government professors, that history is largely one of exclusion by better-established parties.
The Greens, like the Know-Nothings or the Greenbacks, built their successes on a limited range of issues at a historically specific moment. They hoped to push the Democrats farther left, and force the party to reevaluate its platform.
“Traditionally, the rationale for this is education. It’s a way to get ideas out there,” Harvard Kennedy School professor Alex Keyssar ’69 said. “There are a lot of parties that have had significant regional strength or success confined to a state....And in so doing they pushed the major parties.”
The Green Party has had a good deal of local and even statewide success, but the jump to national politics is hard, Harvard history and literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 said. Stein is currently only on the ballot in 37 states. She plans a write-in campaign in others. And though she has qualified for federal matching funds, Stein has little financial support. The Democrats, by contrast, have enough of both to ignore a relatively quiet movement like the Green Party.
The question, professors say, is whether people are listening. If the Green Party could replicate the support it drew in the early 2000s and incorporate the highly energized but politically ambiguous Occupy movement, professors say it could make a difference.
“It’s no secret that a lot of people think the system isn’t working,” Keyssar said.
Still, a Gallup poll released Sept. 13 reporter only one percent of Americans planned to vote for a third-party candidate.
“There’s been a sea change [since 2000]. You have a much clearer and starker set of options and that’s one reason the Green Party isn’t going to get much traction this time around,” said McCarthy, who said he has voted for the Green Party in the past.
“There’s nobody, even Jill Stein, who thinks Jill Stein is going to be president of the United States. Given that reality, everyone who votes for Jill Stein has to realize that is a futile electoral act. It may be a noble one, but it’s futile.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LOWELL, Mass.—Flushing out campaign trail accusations and platform promises, U.S. Senator Scott Brown and Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren disagreed on job creation, tax policy, and immigration reform Monday during the second debate for the Massachusetts U.S. Senate race.
 
Guided by moderator David Gregory, host of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the candidates weighed in on everything from tax policy to the withdrawal from Afghanistan, helping to advance dueling campaign narratives and political visions in the hour long, prime time debate.
 
Warren, a Harvard Law School professor and political newcomer, said her priority as a senator would be fixing a broken system for the working families of Massachusetts. Citing jobs bills, research grants, and infrastructure, Warren laid out a populist message that has become familiar in recent weeks.
 
“I will work with anyone—Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, vegetarian—if they will work for America’s families,” Warren said.
 
But when asked to name a Republican member in Congress she would be willing to work with, Warren came up blank. Brown seized the opportunity highlight his own bipartisan record in the Senate.
 
“I don’t work for anybody,” Brown said. “A good idea is a good idea no matter where it comes from.”
 
The exchange was repeated in various forms throughout the night as Brown pushed his bipartisanship and Warren’s strong ideological stances. He said he was willing to back legislation that would benefit Massachusetts and the country, and not necessarily that which the Republican party supports. Brown went as far as to praise the president’s handling of Afghanistan and his work on the bi-partisan STOCK Act—a measure Brown co-sponsored. The Senator dodged questions about the distance he has created for himself from former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney.
 
As in the first debate, much of the first 30 minutes Monday were dedicated to character attacks that have predominated the race in recent weeks. Gregory pressed Brown to clarify charges he has made that Warren gained an unfair advantage while at Harvard by identifying as Native American. He also pushed the senator to better-define his claims that Warren advocated against the working voters as a corporate counsel for Travelers Insurance and LTV Steel.
 
“I think character is how you live your life,” Warren said, later adding, “I have worked hard for 30 years to make the legal system just a little bit fairer for people. I think that is a good test of character.”
 
Though they agreed to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and not to raise taxes on working class families, Brown and Warren disagreed on how to fix the economy and reform the country’s immigration system. At times, the debate became heated as both candidates fought to address charges leveled against them. “Excuse me, I'm not a student in your classroom, please let me respond,” Brown said during a back and forth about three jobs bills he voted against last fall.
 
Warren accused Brown of missing out on too many chances to help Massachusetts unemployed by generating jobs and cutting oil subsidies. Warren expressed her own support for the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Plan, which would fill the budget deficit with combined spending cuts and revenue increases. She also said she would support the President’s jobs bill.
 
Brown countered Warren’s claims, saying the problem’s weighing on the economy had more to do with regulations and taxes than a lack of government spending.
 
“People are concerned,” Brown said. “They don’t know what’s next...and as a result there are less people hiring.” 
 
The candidates diverged again when discussing the Dream Act, which would grant amnesty to certain illegal immigrants brought into the country as children. Though both agreed there was need for broad immigration policy reform, Brown said he could not support the act.
 
“I am in favor of full legal immigration,” Brown said. “In terms of the Dream Act, no I don’t support it. It's a form of backdoor amnesty.”
 
The candidates will meet in central Massachusetts for an Oct. 10 debate in Springfield before finishing their debate schedule in Boston on Oct. 30, just a week ahead of election day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy, the longest-serving city manager in Cambridge’s history, presented his final budget before the City Council on Monday night.
 
Healy’s budget, which will go into effect for the 2013 fiscal year, includes a raise in government salaries after pay stayed flat in 2012, as well as an increase covering health insurance costs and claims. It will raise taxes by 2.87 percent, a figure Healy praised. “The tax rate is only going up 2.87 percent. That’s the lede; that’s what we should be going out with,” he said.
 
The city manager also praised the number of new businesses that had arrived in Cambridge over the past year, noting that they provided employment and enlarged the city’s tax base. “When you look across the city skyline, you see cranes. Cranes are good,” he said.
 
While the majority of the Council seemed pleased with Healy’s final budget, some Cambridge residents at the meeting took issue with the use of over $9 million of unencumbered funds—which are generally set aside for non-recurring expenditures in times of emergency or unforeseen circumstances—for the purpose of reducing tax rates.
 
One resident, Gerald Bergen, suggested that the Council divert some of the funds away from wealthier recipients of the tax breaks, like MIT and large commercial property owners. Instead, he said, the money should be spent on initiatives directed toward middle-income households and small business owners, like sustainability grants.
 
“The city bird of Cambridge, I guess, is now the crane,” Bergen said, referring to Healy’s frequent mention of new real estate construction in the city. “Maybe we can put that on some of our stationery.”
 
Councillor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom disagreed with Bergen, saying that instead the city should put an additional $6.5 million of unencumbered funds toward not only keeping the tax rate low but avoiding any increase at all above 2012 tax levels.
 
“This is the money we can use, now at $117 million, to do things that are extraordinary,” she said of the unencumbered funds. “What will we do with this money that’s extraordinary?”
 
Vice Mayor E. Denise Simmons argued that Healy’s budget already struck an ideal balance, alleviating the tax burden for residents without depleting unencumbered funds meant for more dire circumstances. “It still moves us forward but keeps us fiscally constrained in a way that says, ‘We don’t overspend.’”
 
She praised Healy, who will retire in June after a career of more than thirty years leading the city,  for his final budget. “He holds on to a penny so tight he makes Lincoln cry,” she joked.
 
The budget passed unanimously, 8-0; Councillor Leland Chung was absent traveling through Europe on an Eisenhower Fellowship.
Also in attendance at Monday’s meeting were employees of the Eastern Bus Company, who asked the Council to pass an order supporting their demand that two bus drivers whom they said had been fired for their involvement in organizing their union be rehired. The Council passed the order unanimously, and also noted that Service Employees International Union Local 615, whose members appeared before the Council last week, had successfully negotiated a tentative contract.
 
In addition to the budget, Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., added in a late policy order urging the Council to devote more money and attention to the city’s rat problem. Toomey said he had heard numerous reports from his constituents in the past week of rambunctious rodents.
 
“People are deathly afraid. They’re not even using their backyards,” Toomey said. “They’re coming out in the daytime. When rats are coming out in the daytime and looking at you, you know there’s a serious public health problem.”
 
The order passed unanimously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the reported withdrawals of co-captains Kyle Casey ’13 and Brandyn Curry ’13 from the College due to their alleged involvement in the cheating scandal surrounding a government course, senior Christian Webster ’13 and junior Laurent Rivard ’14 were recently chosen to replace them as the squad’s co-captains for the upcoming season in a team-wide vote.
“It’s a great honor that my teammates see me in that light,” Webster said. “The team embraced me with open arms, and it’s been a great ride so far [in my career]. I’m just looking forward to what’s to come.”
Players on the squad noted that the departure of Casey and Curry along with the graduation of 2011-12 co-captains Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12 left Webster and Rivard as the most game-tested members of the squad.
“They have a lot of experience, the most experience on the team,” forward Steve Moundou-Missi ’15 said. “I’m sure they’ll be ready to lead us this year.”
According to guard Alex Nesbitt ’15, the pair is well suited for the leadership position.
“They complement each other very well,” Nesbitt said. “They’re both really vocal, they both really care about the team, and they’ll do whatever [it takes] to make sure we do well.”
“During games and practices, they’re always the ones telling us to go harder, to talk more, to step up,” Mondou-Missi echoed.
Webster emphasized Rivard’s strength as a leader by example.
“Everyone’s going to have to live up to how hard [Laurent] works every day in practice, and even when we’re not practicing,” Webster said. “Just by how hard he works he really demands a level of respect.”
Casey and Curry could not be reached for comment Monday night, while Rivard declined to comment. Team spokesman Tim Williamson also could not be reached, while men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Webster was a member of Amaker’s second recruiting class, a highly touted group headlined by the trio of Curry, Casey, and Webster. As a sophomore, Webster finished second on the squad in scoring, averaging 13 points per game.
But after suffering a minor injury and turning in a number of inconsistent performances to start the 2011-12 season, Webster was replaced by Rivard in the starting lineup.
Rivard finished the year as the team’s third-leading scorer while Webster’s production dipped to 4.5 points per game.
Now, following the departures of four of the five starters from Harvard’s 2011-12 Ivy championship winning squad, Rivard and Webster will likely often be asked to play together—and to lead the team together, as well.
“As two older guys who have played a lot of minutes, we’re just going to have to show the young-ins how to do it,” Webster said. “Everything starts with the veterans in our program; we’re just going to have to lead more vocally and show those guys what has to be done.”
With practices set to get underway in two weeks—initiated by the second-ever Crimson Madness, which will take place on October 13—Webster said Amaker has made clear that despite the departures of his two stars, the coach was still expecting to win in 2012-13.
“Coach Amaker’s adjusted well [to the losses of Casey and Curry],” Webster said. “He’s made it clear that we’re not as much of an under-the-radar team anymore, and everyone’s embraced it.”
Despite the national media attention surrounding the withdrawals of Curry and Casey, Webster hopes the team can now turn its attention to the upcoming season.
“It’s no different than the last three years I’ve been here,” he said. “Everyone’s excited and ready to go. We’re just trying to get better every day. That’s all we can do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While men’s water polo freshman Ben Zepfel may reign victorious as The Crimson's Athlete of the Week, three other standouts deserve recognition for their excellence this week:
COLTON CHAPPLE, FOOTBALL
Despite being pulled before the third quarter during Harvard's 52-3 rout of Holy Cross on Friday night, senior quarterback Colton Chapple tallied 260 yards on 13-for-18 passing on Friday night against the Crusaders. Before being relieved by sophomore Connor Hempel, Chapple threw for four touchdowns, ran for one and had a key hand-off to senior running back Rich Zajeski that brought Harvard to lead Holy Cross 49-3 at the half. Chapple helped establish a new program record of 49 points in one half and extended the Crimson's win streak even further to 12 games.
CYNTHIA TASSOPOULOS, FIELD HOCKEY
Senior goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulous aided Harvard in its first Ivy win with a 1-0 victory over Brown in Providence on Saturday. The Bears proved pugnacious in their offense in the first half, shooting 10 attempts against the co-captain before senior forward Emma Keller broke through Brown's defense to tally the lone goal in the 65th minute of play. The victory was the second shutout of the season for Tassopoulos, who now has recorded five of them in her career with the Crimson. She posted seven saves in the game and pushed her save percentage to .818, the highest in the Ancient Eight.
MEG CASSCELLS-HAMBY, SOCCER
After scoreless first and second halves, it was sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby who scored the lone goal in overtime for Harvard on Saturday afternoon as the Crimson took down rival Yale, 1-0. Casscells-Hamby's attack, assisted by sophomore midfielder Lauren Urke, prevented the Crimson from falling to 0-2 in the Ivy League and gave new hope to the season. The Bulldogs put up a strong defense, with goalkeeper Rachel Ames making eight saves, but failed to provide any offensive power, recording no shots on target in the contest. The score was Casscell-Hamby's first game-winner and second total of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many freshmen, there is an adjustment period between high school and college. In addition to living away from their family for the first time and having to do their own laundry, freshman athletes must transition from playing high school freshmen—barely past puberty—to college upperclassmen that present a far stiffer challenge.
Not for Ben Zepfel. The freshman water polo player currently leads his team in goals and is third in assists. Zepfel scored 13 goals in four games over the weekend’s Bison Classic, where the Crimson (12-6, 4-0) went 3-1.
“I really think that the only adjustment period was the game we played the first weekend over the Labor Day invite,” Zepfel said. “For the freshman, as a group, that was the first time we played collegiate water polo and it was a bit shocking to us. But then we realized it’s the same game that we’ve been playing but on a different level.”
Harvard won the first three games of the weekend to stretch its win streak to nine, its longest streak since 2002. But in its last game, the Crimson fell, 10-8, to Bucknell despite four goals, three steals, and an assist from Zepfel.
The Newport Beach, Calif. native has scored 36 of his 43 goals in the last three weekends and contributed three goals in Harvard’s closest victory of the weekend—a one-goal triumph over Navy B.
“Ben works really hard every day in practice to make himself and the team better,” classmate Robbie Fluegge said. “He’s been probably one of our most consistent players in terms of both scoring and defense. It’s inspiring to have people like Ben on your team because you know they will give everything they have night in and night out.”
The freshman class includes the Crimson’s top three scorers in Zepfel, Blake Lee, and Noah Harrison. Freshman goalie Colin Woolway has 71 saves and Lee leads the team in assists and is tied with Harrison for the lead in steals.
“I think the freshmen all came in from great programs and brought a mental attitude about winning that’s been infectious to everyone else,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “They make everyone laugh and they have earned all the respect they have gotten from their teammates by their work ethic and the way they treat their teammates.”
A standout water polo player in high school, Zepfel was a member of the U18 National Championship team from Southern California and was named the 2011 Scholar-Athlete of the Year by the Orange County Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. After graduating, Zepfel has followed in the footsteps of his older brother, Evan Zepfel ’12, a graduated member of last year’s Harvard squad.
“[Evan and Ben] are very similar in the passion that they have for the game and how much they love water polo,” Minnis said. “They play the game very similarly but also different in that Evan was more of an attacker and shot the ball real well from the outside. Ben is versatile but he feels better with his back to the goal even though he can also shoot from the outside.”
The Crimson has only four games remaining before the Ivy Championships, held Oct. 27 at Yale, and Zepfel said that between now and then, Harvard has plenty to improve on. The team will travel to California this coming weekend to play in the Claremont Convergence, which, according to Zepfel, is a prime opportunity to play games against quality opposition.
“This weekend, we are going to be playing some of the best teams in the country,” Zepfel said. “We will play UCSB, who will be ranked number two in the country. After we go out there and play some really high level teams and get some experience playing at a high level, we’ll be able to come back to [the Eastern Championships] having learned a lot.”
The Crimson has rebounded to win nine of ten after a starting the season 3-5. Junior captain Will Roller added that the loss comes at an opportune time, when Harvard has time to work on its play before the Nov. 3 Northern Championship and Nov. 16 Eastern championships.
“We have a lot of the raw physical abilities needed to be very competitive,” Roller said. “But there are mental lapses we need to overcome in order to make that leap from a good team to great team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team will be looking to rebuild momentum and break a five-game winless streak when it hosts crosstown rival Boston College on Tuesday night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
The Crimson (1-5-2, 0-0-1 Ivy) is looking forward to matching up with the Eagles (5-3-1, 1-1-1 ACC) before returning to Ivy League play against Cornell on Saturday.
“It’s always a great game just because its crosstown, and that’s something we enjoy,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “You want to be the best in the area.”
Harvard tied Yale, 0-0, in double overtime last Saturday after going winless on a three-game West Coast road trip. The Crimson’s sole win this season came against Michigan State earlier this month.
Harvard dominated the Bulldogs for the majority of the contest but ultimately failed to capitalize on goal-scoring opportunities. Despite the result, the Crimson came away with many positive things to build on in Tuesday’s game.
“We’ve really figured out our system of pressure,” Friedman said. “In the Yale game, we had the ball mostly because every time they got it, we were all over them, and they would turn it over.”
Harvard kept the ball in Yale’s half for the majority of the game and displayed offensive creativity that it would like to recreate against BC.“We executed our playing style very well, and we were very good defending on Saturday” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “
The only thing lacking in Saturday’s game was that urgency to score the winning goal.”The Eagles enter the contest on a three-game winning streak, most recently beating conference rival North Carolina State, 2-1.
BC’s offense is led by senior forward Charlie Rugg, who has contributed four of 12 goals scored by the team so far. In the win against NC State, Rugg logged one goal and one assist for his second straight match.
“It should be a really competitive game,” Junot said. “In my mind, in Charlie Rugg and [senior midfielder] Kyle Bekker, they have two of the better players in the country.”
Boston College has also relied on a strong defense, led by freshman goalkeeper Alex Kapp, who has allowed only one goal this season and boasts a remarkable 86 percent save rate. The Crimson knows that it will have to come out strong to shut down the technically skilled Eagles squad.
“The biggest thing is that we have to bring energy,” said Friedman. “BC is more of a skilled team so they are going to try to be passive. If we really surprise them by coming out strong, we are going to have more success against them.”
Harvard dropped last year’s contest, 2-0, after BC scored twice early on its home field. The Crimson trails in the all-time head-to-head series, going 6-10-4 since 1981. But Harvard is prepared for the stiff competition.
“BC is a very strong team,” Junot said. “Obviously we know them very well, being so local, and they know us well. Some of our players have grown up playing with and against each other.”
Harvard has been facing a deliberately tough non-conference schedule this year. After going winless in the Ivy League last season, Junot wanted to ensure that the Crimson was prepared for its conference contests. With only seven league games in the season, non-conference games are a way for Harvard to solidify its lineup and prepare mentally and physically for the challenges of the Ancient Eight.
“We’ve been preparing ourselves against the best teams in the country prior to Ivy League play,” Junot said. “Part of what you saw on Saturday night was a reflection of the quality of preparation we’ve had.”
The Crimson’s offense has come from a number of sources, with each of its five goals being scored by a different player. Freshman Jake Freeman leads the team with eight shots on goal.
Harvard has struggled defensively but is getting stronger, allowing just three goals in its past three games with the help of key players returning from injury. Friedman returned after missing the first four games, and his strong throw-ins helped create many scoring opportunities against Yale.
Sophomore forward Hiroshi Kobayashi missed two games early in the season due to an ankle injury, but he has worked his way back to being an integral part of the offense.
Despite the fact that it is a non-conference game, the result is still very important to the Crimson, and the team will be putting its best lineup forward.
“We try to learn from every game and improve with every game,” Friedman said. “We are going to take it as seriously as an Ivy League match.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After graduating a talented class of seniors last year, the Harvard sailing team is finding it difficult to find its footing early on in the season.
The co-ed teams traveled to the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., placing 14th at the Danmark Trophy Regatta. Meanwhile, junior Morgan Russom from the woman’s team headed south to Connecticut College to take 9th place at the NEISA Women’s Singlehanded Championship.
“[Losing the seniors has] changed our ability to compete at the top level,” Crimson coach Mike O’Connor said. “Right now we’re working on our game and trying to come around. Instead of playing at the front of the fleet, we’re at the back or the middle, and that’s something that we’re trying to change.”
Despite unimpressive results, the Harvard sailors noted the importance of their consistency during the regattas.
“We didn’t put up any stellar results, but it was good to be able to be consistent,” sophomore Michael Drumm said. “A lot about sailing at a high level is about consistency; you don’t need to win every race to win the regatta. Consistency is key, and you can gain that by eliminating mistakes.”
DANMARK TROPHY
The Harvard co-ed team raced in unfamiliar gaffe-rigged boats to finish 14th in the 20-team field at the Danmark Trophy Regatta.
“We just didn’t have any experience with these gaffe-rigged boats, so we didn’t really know how it worked,” sophomore Gram Slattery said. “We knew we were going to have to build up our experience in this type of boat.”
The Crimson squads faced an added challenge of sailing in difficult weather on the Thames River, which differs greatly from the familiar Charles River. The A-division team of junior Alma Lafler and sophomores Gram Slattery, Michael Drumm, and Brian Drumm had a rough start but finished strong, as the trio recorded top-10 finishes in its last three races. They ended up with 127 total points, good for 16th place.
Freshman Andrew Mollerus, junior Alma Lafler, and sophomore Brian Drumm manned the Division B boat for Harvard. The sailors recorded top-five finishes in their first two races but couldn’t maintain that performance, as they faded to an 11th place finish of 90 points.
Three of the Crimson’s Ancient Eight rivals were also in attendance at the regatta. Boats from Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown joined Harvard on the Thames over the weekend.
The Brown A-division boat led their team to victory by finishing in the top five in all but two races. The Bears tallied 119 points overall en route to the win.
NEISA WOMEN’S SINGLEHANDED CHAMPIONSHIP
Facing tough weather conditions as well, junior Morgan Russom of the women’s team finished ninth out of 18 sailors in the NEISA Women’s Singlehanded Championship. A shifty wind and rain presented a challenge to the sailors in the regatta.
Russom also found herself racing in an unfamiliar boat, as the competitors raced in laser boats. The junior is used to competing in the conventional college boat, the FJ.
“It’s hard to go into a regatta that you didn’t really train for in the boat, but I’m pretty happy with how it went,” Russom said.
Shaking off a rough start, Russom’s results improved over the course of the weekend, and she showed a top-10 finish in all but two races on the second day of the regatta. She finished with a total of 131 points.
“The women’s New England singlehanded championship is a very, very competitive regatta,” O’Connor said. “For [Russom] to finish in the top half of the fleet is a pretty strong result. There were six women in the fleet who could potentially finish in the top three at the national championships.”
Freshman Erika Reineke of Boston College had a dominant showing, finishing first in nearly half of her races to total 30 points on her way to becoming the NEISA singlehanded champion.
O’Connor attributes the results from the weekend more to a lack of experience rather than of talent.
“What we do has worked for a long time, so we just have to keep working on it and give the kids some time and experience playing at the top level so they become more comfortable with it,” O’Connor said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After weeks of the uncharacteristically warm and beautiful weather, Cambridge skies are back to normal.  The sun is gone, storm clouds loom overhead, and cold winds have led to long days for the brave souls who thought they could wear shorts.  We all knew it couldn’t last forever.  Surprise, freshmen!
If it’s time to bundle up for the winter, that means hockey season is around the corner. Last year, the Harvard men’s hockey team exceeded expectations when it reached the ECAC championship game. They also surprised us with their strong tweets.
We decided to browse Twitter and see how some Crimson skaters are biding their time until the season opener against Bentley University on Oct. 27. These are the tweets that stood out:
1) Sophomore forward Colin Blackwell admits that he should have done a better job packing for school:
I probably should have brought more than 3 pairs of socks to college
Quick math problem: how many times has Colin worn those pair of socks? Well, classes started a little under one month ago. So if there are seven days a week and four weeks have passed... that’s not hygienic. Somebody get this man a pair of socks.
2) Blackwell may not watch MTV, but one of his teammates sure does.  On September 27, Blackwell revealed this via Twitter:
"Back home I used to watch MTV so much, that show 21 and pregnant" - ‪@swiss_beaut
@Swiss_beaut is none other than teammate Ryan McGregor.  Who knew ECAC All-Academic selections have guilty pleasure TV shows? We’re hoping that the real explanation is a lack of channel choice in Switzerland.
3) Some people say that Annenberg looks like it belongs in a Harry Potter movie.  Apparently, freshman forward Jimmy Vesey thinks it’s just as magical on the inside:
Get me a copy of Annenberg's soundtrack
Don’t hate, we’ve all been there. Even though we’re pretty sure it’s just the radio, HUDS should give him a soundtrack to play at Predators games. We don’t think the NHL is ready for this.
4) Tommy O’Regan, a sophomore forward, doesn’t like to be disturbed in class:
If this kid in front of me platonically cuddles with the girl next to him again, I'm gonna scalp him. Were in class here Chief Ericsson
First off, huge points for the witty, historical reference. We’d also like to agree that PDA in class is never cool. Since the Boston Globe hasn’t reported scalping since the Pequot War, we assume the two lovebirds kept to themselves.
5) Later in the week, Tommy reminisced about technology from his childhood:
I miss the sound of dial-up internet
Ahh, the sound of a slow Internet connection. We prefer the silence of hi-speed, wireless Internet, but to each his own.
Those are your Tweets of the Week.  Cold weather is upon us, and the hockey team is already doing big things off the ice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s water polo coach Ted Minnis is enjoying the recent successes of his team. Through 18 games, the Crimson (12-6, 4-0 CWPA) has amassed a 12-6 overall record and had orchestrated a nine-game winning streak, its first since 2002, before falling at the Bison Invitational to host team Bucknell this past weekend.
But when he’s not focused on helping Harvard to get to its second straight CWPA Eastern Championship, Minnis is busy preparing for the beginning of the Crimson Water Polo Club team season.
The Crimson Water Polo Club team, which starts its season in two weeks, is a United States Water Polo-affiliated club with an enrollment of about 10-14 local youth between the age of 11 and 16. Practices are run Wednesday and Thursday evenings after Harvard varsity practices at either the Blodgett or MAC pools.
This isn’t the first time Minnis has been involved with USWP affiliated club water polo programs.
During his time as an assistant coach for the Stanford women’s club water polo team, Minnis gained valuable insights while working with Stanford women’s water polo head coach John Tanner.
“I came up as a coach through the development side,” Minnis said. “ I very much consider myself a development guy.”
Many of the players on the team come from local prep schools that have interscholastic water polo leagues some coming from as far Acton, Mass., a 40-minute drive away from the Harvard campus.
“We are the only age group water polo team in Boston,” Minnis said. “We’ve been around for about one and a half years now.
The team works on many basic strategies and tactics that Minnis has amassed over his years coaching and playing the sport, and the coach stresses the importance of good role models and solid fundamentals in developing youth.
Although his time commitment to the Harvard varsity water polo programs is significant, the Menlo Park, Calif. native wants to continue to spread his love and passion for water polo to the East Coast.
Minnis commented that he is looking forward to extending the team to accommodate a Masters team that would host college-age and adult-age play.

In this mini-series, Flyby will profile one of the seven fall 2012 IOP Fellows each week. This week: Mark D. McKinnon.
The first thing you might notice about IOP Fellow Mark D. McKinnon is his sense of style. From his trademark cowboy hat and panuelo scarf, the man who was President George W. Bush's communications strategist stands out in a world of plain black suits.
"I spent a lot of my early life trying to look like everyone in meetings, but I was never really comfortable in a suit and tie," McKinnon said in a phone interview. "I'm more comfortable in the room when I look like the weird guy, because I am the weird guy."
This semester, McKinnon is leading the IOP study group "Political Disruption: Where It's Coming From and Why We Need It" on Wednesdays from 4 to 5:30 p.m. in room L166 at the IOP. Discussions are focused on movements for change like the Occupy movement, the Tea Party movement, and the bipartisan group No Labels, which McKinnon co-founded. The paralysis of the current political system is another theme in his study group.
Before getting involved in politics, McKinnon, who has worked with other notable clients including Lance Armstrong and John McCain, went to Nashville to try to become a songwriter. When he didn't strike success, McKinnon left for Texas to become a journalist. He worked for political campaigns for thirty years after that, but now writes weekly columns in The Daily Beast and The London Telegraph.
"In recent years, I've evolved to the point where I'm not doing campaigns but I'm writing about them and teaching about them," he said.
Though McKinnon worked as a democrat for 15 years of his life, he switched party affiliation after Bush was elected as governor of Texas. McKinnon said that he liked that Bush raised issues that McKinnon cared about, like education and immigration reform.
When asked about his changing political affiliation over the years, McKinnon said, "Well I started off as an anarchist. I'm on a long journey here."
McKinnon developed a close relationship with George W. Bush and worked as Bush's chief media adviser during his presidential campaign and bid for reelection.
"Well initially we clicked, not for political reasons, but for personal ones. We shared a lot of father stories about our daughters and how to raise kids," McKinnon said. "Also we had a passion for running, and we started running together."
After working on multiple successful campaigns, McKinnon has some insight into how to communicate effectively.
"The secret," he said, "is to have a clear rationale, to be able to tell a story, to communicate a message briefly, to do it emotionally, to do it authentically, and to do it with a lot of repetition."

After a year in Boston, New Balance's bike-sharing program, Hubway, has expanded rapidly into Cambridge and Somerville. This expansion gives Harvard students a cheaper and greener, albeit more strenuous, alternative to the shuttle. 
Stations have been installed at Mass. Ave., the Charles Hotel, Brattle St., and more recently the Law School and DeWolfe St. Sadly, Hubway stations aren't acessible to Quadlings, arguably those who would benefit most from a bike sharing program for their morning and evening commutes to and from the Yard.
