After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A man is cut down in the street by a lunatic. His distraught widow sits in a café, awaiting his best friend. His best friend aspires to take his place as her husband. Translated from Javier Marías’s 2011 Spanish-language novel, “The Infatuations” presents this tangled web of human dealings from the perspective of María, a publisher’s assistant who frequents the same café as the ill-fated Miguel Deverne and Luisa, his widow, and who is slowly drawn into this web.
“The Infatuations” is a profoundly engaging work, although not for the reasons one might think. American press for the book has tended to emphasize the fact that it is nominally a murder mystery. This emphasis is misleading. The plot is so predictable as to be archetypal; one is reminded not of the sharp twists and turns of American or British mystery novels so much as the ritualized forms of Attic tragedy or commedia dell’ arte. In short, there is very little “mystery” to this mystery. Nevertheless, “The Infatuations” is still well worth reading, just as tragedies and commedie are still worth watching—the devil, as always, is in the details.
Marías has not given us a wholly original set of events to ponder; rather, he has given us a reflection on the transience of love and the ultimate insurmountability of death, a rumination of great tranquility reflected in his long, aperiodic sentences, which recall the peacefulness of Camus’s “The Stranger” without that work’s predominant haziness of detail. There are many extended passages on the final quietude of death, none perhaps so clear as an imagined speech that María attributes to the dead Deverne. Speaking of the dead’s indifference toward the activities of the living—specifically his own indifference to the marriage of his best friend and his widow—he says:  “You know that everything will carry on without you, that nothing stops because you have disappeared. But that ‘afterwards’ doesn’t concern you.”
There are many such passages, particularly in the first half of the book. In them one finds a Lucretian sensibility of death as final, for the best, and not to be feared. Like Lucretius in “De Rerum Natura,” however, Marías’s persistent dwelling on the theme of mortality to the exclusion of other concerns—including getting the novel’s action off the ground—seems to belie this message; whether this is the intention of the author or rather a flaw is up to the reader. It seems to be his intention, for Marías knows well the ways in which people think, and accordingly the attribution of a flawed rhetoric should be reserved. It must nevertheless be noted that the novel’s constant digressions occasionally flirt with the trite: “There was still the possibility that it wasn’t, according to him, of course (I would never know more than what he told me, and so I would never know anything for sure; yes, it’s ridiculous, isn’t it, that after all these centuries of practice, after so many incredible advances and inventions, we still have no way of knowing when someone is lying; naturally, this both benefits and prejudices all of us equally, and may be our one remaining redoubt of freedom).” This observation is true, but is so commonplace as to be of questionable value even in a parenthetical statement.
Regardless of any imperfections in execution, “The Infatuations” is a remarkable book, not least in that it accomplishes the very difficult task of holding a reader for half its length before introducing any sort of dramatic conflict. Its ambition of scope is admirable, directly addressing as it does the two most looming themes of human thought, love and death; and yet it still manages to avoid entirely the overwrought tone that almost inevitably plagues such books. Indeed, here perhaps we find the greatest virtue of “The Infatuations”: it brings a peaceful reflection on mortality to our daily lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congratulations! If you are reading this, you have most likely survived your first month of the year at Harvard! Unfortunately, it probably will not be long before you are begging to go back to September.
However, there is good news. If you are reading this, you also have most likely perfected the art of procrastination in just a mere month! To reward you for your accomplishment, we at The Back Page give you this year’s first installment of Tweets of the Week!
In the past, we have found our favorite tweets from Harvard athletes and shared a few of them with you every week. However, coming off a long summer and a tough first month of classes, we feel that you deserve more. So without further ado, we give you our top 10 – that’s right, 10 – tweets of the week!
10. Murph Vandervelde, a junior lacrosse player, kicks off our countdown with an observation of his fellow classmates.
“Some people just don’t get it…walking down the street to class with your IPhone full volume bumping Beyonce is always a bad look…”
Sorry Murph, but Beyonce is a legend.
9. There seems to be no bigger fan of the Cambridge water system­ than John Rose, a senior on the baseball team.
“Water fountains are great for when I want to know what your building tastes like.”
8. Our next spot goes to Kevin Rex, a freshman baseball player, who provides us with an ode to a legend.
“If Steve Irwin was still alive I bet he’d still be huntin crocs and wearin entirely too short beige shorts #RIPCrocodileHunter”
This is just one more reason to hate stingrays this week. Go Sox.
7. Her sport may not be in season yet, but Cassie Corneau, a junior diver, already has set a pretty high preseason goal.
“Some girls dream about finding the perfect guy. Nope. My dream is to not have to dry my hair more than once a day #h2oathleteproblems”
6. Dear anonymous Annenberg-goer: Matt Fraschilla, a freshman on the basketball team, is impressed.
“Kid just pulled the ol’ shatter-a-bowl-and-casually-walk-away move like a champ #dininghallobservations”
5. Freshman wrestler Colton Peppelman assures you that there are plenty of reasons to love Harvard.
“Team breakfast ended with everyone singing songs from the Aristocats soundtrack. Yeah, I definitely picked the right school.”
A cat’s the only cat who knows where it’s at—words to live by.
4. Jimmy Vesey, a sophomore hockey player, is among the estimated 100 percent of students who are tired of seeing tourists on campus.
“There are tourists at the Harvard-Brown game looking at PowerPoint slides of the basic rules of football #Harvard #Jaw”
Technically, the game was much different at the time Harvard Stadium was built. However, there is still no slack to be cut.
3-1: We have a trio of tweets that take the collective top spot. In recent weeks, pop star Miley Cyrus has controversially taken the world by storm. She has driven off many of her fans with her recent antics, but numerous loyal fans have stood by her side.  Sophomore basketball player Patrick Steeves, junior hockey player Tommy O’Regan, and sophomore baseball player DJ Link all have had a say in this debate.
“Anybody remember Mack Maine saying ‘In about 3 yrs holla at me Miley Cyrus?’ I wonder if that’s what he imagined” –Steeves
“I’m so on the Miley train it’s not even funny” –O’Regan
“Been bumping non stop to 23. Miley’s doin it right #J’sonmyfeet” -Link

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just over five minutes left to play in regulation at Jordan Field, the Harvard field hockey team got on the scoreboard for the first time Saturday. But the late offensive spark was not enough to clinch Harvard’s first at-home victory of the season, as Brown managed to sink the ball into the net two minutes into sudden death overtime for the 2-1 victory.
“We worked hard, but we weren’t as smart as we should have been,” Crimson Coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said.  “We didn’t finish when we had some opportunities. They were just smarter than we were in some aspects of the game.”
Both regulation goals came late. Throughout the game’s entire first half the two squads maintained an empty scoreboard. This solid defensive effort by both the Crimson and the Bears was anchored by each team’s respective goalie. Harvard senior Jenn Hatfield contributed five stops for the Crimson while Brown’s Shannon McSweeney stopped a total of 10 shots in the match.
However, this airtight defensive affair was broken when Brown’s Alexis Miller capitalized on a short corner opportunity midway through the second half.  Miller caught the Crimson’s defense off guard to make the score 1-0 in the Bears’ favor. Close to 15 minutes passed before the Crimson had any answer to this offensive advance.
“They were smart enough to have a shooter going off sides, which we don’t see happen too often,” van Herwaarden said.
The response to Miller’s goal came in the form of sophomore Elizabeth Jacobson, who powered through Brown’s defense in a short corner penalty with the assistance of teammates Noel Painter and Caroline McNeill.
“We’ve been working really hard this week on corners,” Jacobson said. “We know that if we capitalize on them, [winning] will be a lot easier.”
The teams were neck and neck for the whole game, with each team making aggressive plays that simply were not finishing to either’s advantage. The Crimson led the Bears the entire game in shots taken on goal with Harvard tallying 15 attempted goals to Brown’s 10.  Harvard also controlled most the majority of possession.
“We came out with a lot of fire,” Jacobson said. “I thought we did really well, we had good control. We just needed to get those simple chances and capitalize early.”
In the aftermath of Jacobson’s game tying goal, both squads faced the pressure of converting one final tally with just over five minutes left on the clock. With mere seconds left, a foul on Harvard inside the arc led to the seventh corner shot opportunity of the match for the Crimson, giving Harvard one last shot to take the lead and end the contest.
Yet Brown goalie McSweeney denied Harvard’s last-ditch attempt, and with that the Crimson saw itself going into its first overtime of the season.  But the team remains optimistic about its chances heading into the sudden death round.
“Scoring that goal in the last few minutes gave us a lot of momentum,” said van Herwaarden. “We felt pretty good about it.”
This positive mindset was not enough to clinch the win for Harvard.  On the first possession of sudden death, freshman midfielder Kyla Cordrey attempted a shot that came just shy of the back of the net as Brown’s McSweeney notched yet another save.
Quickly, the Bears took advantage of their first and final possession of the overtime period, pushing the ball all the way down the field. Brown junior forward Meghan O’Donnell baited Hatfield out of her home, creating a wide-open chance for Brown to attack the goal. O’Donnell made the cross field pass to fellow forward Hannah Rogers, who put the ball away easily.  As the ball sliced into the net, the Bears garnered their fourth win of the season.
Despite a commanding performance that continually put pressure on Brown’s defense, the Crimson was unable to secure the victory.
“Overall, I think we played a lot better,” said van Herwaarden. “But unfortunately the game is decided by who scored the most goals.”
Van Herwaarden feels strongly about the solid level of the Crimson’s play, and the squad is hopeful that this loss can serve as a learning experience.
“I still think we are in a good spot,” the coach said. “Our philosophies are working; we just need to make that final step. We need to be tougher and we need to be smarter, because that’s what determines the winner.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team battled Yale at the Lee Amphitheater in New Haven, Conn., on Friday night with the hopes of putting an end to a nearly 10-year long losing streak against the Bulldogs. The Crimson, winless against its Eli rivals since 2004, had not even picked up a set since 2010.
Both streaks are still alive, as the Bulldogs (8-3, 2-0 Ivy) handedly defeated Harvard (6-6, 1-2 Ivy) in three sets.
The Crimson attempted to bounce back in its second game of the weekend at Brown on Saturday, but was unable to come up with the victory in a tight, 3-2, contest.
“[This weekend] is something that we can definitely use to move forward, because I feel like we have a lot to give,” sophomore outside hitter Jennifer Shults said. “I think we have the potential to be very successful during the season, and this weekend was just a bad weekend, but I want to try to look at it positively. There’s a lot that we can take away that will help us get better, and move forward.“
BROWN 3, HARVARD 2
The hotly contested battle between Harvard and Brown (6-8, 2-1 Ivy) featured numerous star performances coming from both teams. On the Crimson side, freshman setter Corinne Bain notched a triple-double, leading the team with 33 assists, 11 digs, and a career-high 15 kills. She also chipped in four aces.  Sophomore middle blocker Caroline Holte bounced back from a tough game at Yale to have 13 kills and seven blocks.
Despite the efforts by the Crimson, the Bears ended up eking out the win in five sets, giving the Crimson its second loss of the weekend.
Brown featured senior outside hitter/middle blocker Thea Derrough, who had an impressive 20 kills, as well as junior outside hitter Maddie Lord, who added 15 kills of her own.
The tipping point of the game came near the end of the fourth set, as the teams were tied 19-19. Harvard had already picked up two of the first three sets, but the Bears fought to hold off the Crimson to ensure a fifth and final set. A kill by Derrough and an error by Harvard allowed the Bears to take hold of the advantage. Two more errors on the Crimson side gave the frame to Brown.
In the final set, Brown took control early and finished the game, fittingly, with a kill by Derrough.
“We struggled to run our system and implement the things we’ve been working on in practice and in the preseason during the match,” said Shults. “I think that it was a close game, and one that we could’ve pulled through and won.”
Although the first three matches were more tightly contested, the team that took the lead first ended up winning all five sets. In general, the game was won on a couple of key moments that swung the momentum, and game, in Brown’s favor.
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
It was all Bulldogs during the match, as the Crimson managed to hold only one lead throughout the entire game, a 1-0 advantage in the second set.
The home team was led by sophomore middle blocker Jesse Ebner and junior outside hitter Mollie Rogers, who each had 11 kills. Additionally, Ebner and freshman libero Tori Shepherd contributed three aces apiece. The offensive game was aided by the play of senior setter Kendell Polan, who registered 27 assists.
“We just made some uncharacteristic mistakes, and Yale played very aggressively,” Shults said.
Yale also had multiple strong defensive performances, as Polan led the team with 12 digs, while junior libero Maddie Rudnick added 11 digs. Shepherd and Rogers also came very close to the double-digit mark for digs, but fell short by one and two digs respectively.
Harvard, on the other hand, had no players that recorded double-digit values for any of the aforementioned statistics. Three players had a team-high four kills, while Bain aided with a team-leading eight assists. Holte, one of the Crimson’s most dynamic scorers, had a goose egg in the kills column.
“I thought our team went into the match very fired up, very mentally prepared,” sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace said. “We worked really hard the previous week in preparation for the games. I think one thing we can take away from it is that we can play our system no matter where we are, whether we’re home or away. We started strong, but we definitely have various things we can improve on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New start. New season.
Heading into its Saturday tilt against Yale (2-6-0, 1-0-0 Ivy), the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-6-2, 0-1-0) had emphasized that its nonconference record had no bearing on its future in conference play. The team, which had not lost a game by more than one goal since its first of the season, stressed urgency; senior Kevin Harrington said before the game that “it’s win or go home … at this point.”
But a stout defense faded late for the Crimson, which—after taking a 1-0 lead on a 69th minute sliding strike by senior forward A.J. Agha—gave up two goals in the final three minutes to fall, 2-1, in its first game of conference play.
“We put it all out there on Saturday,” senior Ross Friedman said. “There is a small margin in soccer between winning and losing and we saw that.”
When Agha entered the game in the 64th minute, the score was 0-0. To that point, Harvard had been outshot, 7-2, and earlier had gone through a 40-minute shotless stretch bracketed by a pair of failed Harrington efforts.
Quickly after entering the game, however, Agha kick-started the struggling offense. Three minutes after subbing in, Agha had his first shot blocked by the keeper. Two minutes later, he generated another corner kick.
On the ensuing cross from Friedman, the injury-plagued Agha found the back of the net with his second shot—a sliding redirection that gave the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
“A.J. has been incredible for us,” Friedman said.  “He has always been a great option for us and he has always been a great player and great fighter. He never stops working and we love having A.J. healthy. I know he’s going to put it all out there and so it’s great having him out there.”
The lead could not hold up. After holding Yale scoreless for the next 18 minutes, Bulldog Conner Lachenbruch knocked in a goal after a wild scramble in front of the net to tie up the game. Less than two minutes later, a Harvard red card near the 18-yard box gave Yale a golden free kick opportunity. The Bulldogs converted, with Henos Musie’s kick bounding off the post into the far corner of the goal and providing the final margin of victory.
The loss was the Crimson’s fifth by a single goal in 2013. Friedman said that the team, which has twice let second-half leads slip this season, can take a lot of positives away from the game.
“Two games earlier we were working on finishing the last twenty minutes and we have improved that to the last five minutes,” Friedman said. “Now we just need to work on finishing a game in the last five minutes. It is hard to do that after a loss at Yale but we need to continue to focus on the process.”
In the first half, Harvard struggled to get anything going. The team picked up three quick fouls in the first ten minutes and generated only one shot on goal all half. For the last thirty minutes of the half, the Crimson was limited to one free kick and one corner kick as the offense stalled.
“I thought both teams were kind of getting their feet wet in the first half,” Friedman said. “In the second, everyone settled down and there was a lot more back and forth play. We were really connecting passes and creating opportunities for one another.”
Sophomore Michael Klain said that the team’s loss, while a setback, does not put an insurmountable dent in its Ancient Eight title aspirations. According to the Maryland native, over the course of the year the team has improved significantly in how it deals with losses over the course of the year.
“There’s nothing we can do now to change the outcome of last night; the only outcome we can affect is next Saturday,” Klain said. “Our vision of what we need to do to prepare for each game has gotten clearer, and that has allowed us to take advantage of each opportunity to improve. We have a better idea of what corrections we need to make, and we know better how to make them, so I think we’ll continue to improve every day, and we’ll fight very time we’re on the field, in practice, and in games, because we know our goals are still within reach.”

Harvard women’s soccer scored first in Yale’s Reese Stadium Saturday and extended its winning streak to six with a 3-1 win its second Ivy League game.
“It was an excellent game,” Harvard (6-3-1, 2-0 Ivy) coach Ray Leone said. “We played really well in the first half and did some good attacking things, but in the second half Yale came out flying and it put us on our heels for a long period of time.”
The Bulldogs’ second-half rally closed the differential to a single goal, where it stayed for much of the game.
Yale (3-1, 1-1 Ivy) forward Melissa Gavin scored the lone goal for the hosts in the 57th minute. She tucked a corner-kick behind junior goaltender Cheta Emba to keep her side in it.
“The start of the second half was a little bit hectic and I think it was really important that we did not stop pushing after they scored,” freshman defender Bailey Gary said. “It wasn’t our prettiest game of soccer but we played with a spark and hunger that ultimately got the job done.”
The Harvard-Yale rivalry created a competitive and emotional atmosphere.
“We wanted to be ready for the emotion of the game. We wanted to move the ball and move the ball well, and we really did do that,” Leone said. “It got a little frantic in the middle. When two teams are fighting with everything they’ve got no one is going to dominate for very long.”
The Crimson finished off its opponent with an unassisted breakaway goal by freshman forward Margaret Purce in the 84th minute. Purce ran half the field to fire a shot past the Bulldog goalkeeper with her left foot.
“When [Purce] scored the third goal, it really allowed us to settle down and manage the rest of the game,” Gary said.
Just over 30 minutes into the match, junior defender Marie Margoulis redirected a corner kick by co-captain Peyton Johnson for the days’ first goal.
“The first goal, of course, was really a key moment in the game,” Gary said. “I think it really pumped us up and gave us the boost we needed to get that second goal so quickly after.”
Minutes later, freshman forward Karly Ziatic scored her third goal in four games. Junior midfielder Meg Cascells-Hamby rushed past defense to move the ball forward and set up the play.
“The first half was an amazing stretch so we just kind of held on for dear life,” Leone said. “We were fortunate enough to get in a winning goal to make it 3-1.
The Harvard defense shut down Yale’s offense for the majority of the game.
“We had great defense and our backline was really strong even though Yale has talented attackers,” Leone said. “I think the overall play of the backline was incredible.”
The Bulldogs only managed to attempt six shots on goal compared to the Crimson’s 15.
“We wanted to break Yale’s game apart while remaining true to our own game, so we needed to shut down their key plays and players but not lose our own style of play,” Gary said. “I feel like we accomplished just that and that definitely helped in our win.”
Moving forward, Harvard is looking to recover and prepare for a game against cross-town rival Boston University Tuesday and its next Ivy League competitor, Cornell, next weekend.
“The good thing is we have a game Tuesday. We can flush the legs out and get a practice or two in and we play Boston University on Tuesday,” Leone said. “Our main goal right now is just having another shot before going into the next Ivy League game next Saturday.”
Despite the now six-game winning streak win, the squad is focused on the short term.
“We will be focusing on working hard to prepare, both mentally and physically, for playing Cornell,” Gary said. “We’re really working on taking our season week by week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time a Harvard football game extended past regulation, it beat Yale in triple overtime, eight years ago. Saturday, it took just as many extra periods to down Holy Cross, but the Crimson eventually emerged victorious, 41-35.
After captain linebacker Josh Boyd and senior defensive end Nnamdi Obukwelu brought quarterback Peter Pujals down in the backfield in the third overtime period, the Crusaders were forced to settle for a 45-yard field goal. When the field goal missed wide left, Harvard—which had not led the game since early in the 3rd quarter—had a chance to regain the advantage and end the three-hour battle.
“It was just an unbelievable team effort,” Boyd said. “We talk about overcoming adversity all the time, and whoever makes the last big play is going to win the game, so we knew we had to step up.”
It took only three plays for the Crimson to find the end zone after that. Junior quarterback Conner Hempel found sophomore wide receiver Andrew Fischer for a quick pass, and then junior tailback Paul Stanton broke free and scampered 17 yards into the end zone.
After 14 drives produced just 14 offensive points for Harvard, the Crimson converted on every single one of its possessions in overtime.
The Crusaders caught a break in the first overtime when an incomplete pass on third down turned into a first down following a defensive holding call. Three plays later, Holy Cross was the first to score in overtime as Pujals found wideout Mike Fess in the back of the end zone.
Harvard answered, with Hempel gaining yards through the air and on the ground before hitting senior Tyler Ott for a three-yard score.
The second overtime yielded quick scores for both teams. Hempel found Fischer down the sideline for 18 yards, and Stanton punched it into the end zone. The Crusaders responded quickly with a five-yard touchdown run by wideout Kalif Raymond to set up the final extra period.
FRESH START
Holy Cross’s signal-caller may have been in his first year of college and in his second career start, but for the most part on Saturday, he played like a veteran.
By the end of regulation, Pujals had nearly twice the total passing yardage of Hempel and backup quarterback Michael Pruneau—who came into the gamewhen Hempel was out with a hyperextended knee—combined.
“That kid’s going to be great,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He played his butt off. It’s asking a lot of a freshman in really only his second game starting to play against a good defense like Harvard. I thought he played tremendously.”
Despite sacking Pujals six times, the Harvard defense struggled to slow the freshman, who ended the day with 345 yards and four touchdowns. Pujals also created plays on the ground, electing to keep the ball and rush when none of his receivers were open.
But when Pujals decided to hold onto the ball, it was often costly. The Crimson’s defense, which had a score in both games of the season heading into Saturday, forced four fumbles—all from Pujals, and added to its streak. Junior defensive end Zach Hodges stripped the ball from Pujals and sophomore linebacker Eric Medes fell on top of it in the end zone to give Harvard a 14-7 lead in third quarter.
The Crimson was only able to capitalize on one other fumble—Pujals’s first cough-up gave Harvard the ball at Holy Cross’s 33-yard line. junior running back Andrew Casten found the end zone to put the Crimson on the scoreboard first, 7-0.
STANT-UP GUY
When the team went into the locker room for halftime, Stanton accounted for 71 of Harvard’s 88 offensive yards tallied in the first 30 minutes of play. With Hempel sidelined for much of the first half with an injured knee and second-string quarterback Pruneau unable to produce much offense, the burden fell on Stanton and fellow running back Casten.
Stanton, who became the team’s top tailback with sophomore Zach Boden out with an injury, recorded his first 100-plus yard rushing game, finishing with 103 yards on the ground and another 55 receiving as the quarterbacks’ favorite target of the day.
“He’s unbelievable,” Hempel said. “Especially when Zach Boden gets back, they’re going to be a great, great duo. Paul Stanton has a crazy work ethic and refuses to go down. Our screen game is a force—getting him with the ball in open space, it’s very hard to tackle him.”
The sophomore also scored the final two touchdowns for Harvard to clinch the win for the Crimson, which hadn’t beaten Holy Cross on its home turf in eight years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Coming off a loss last weekend, the Harvard women’s rugby team (2-2) was in need of a boost as it entered Saturday’s contest against Brown.
“Practice this week was very tense,” co-captain Xanni Brown said. “We were told very clearly at the beginning of the week that we needed to step up our effort, and that was what was expected of us to compete at this varsity level. We didn’t practice in our jerseys all week, we didn’t play in them today. We weren’t playing at a Harvard varsity level. I think that actually helped light a fire under some of the girls. We were out there like we used to be, that rag-tag Radcliffe team playing in whatever t-shirts and socks we could scrounge up.”
Going back to its roots, the Crimson looked and played like a new team, tearing past the Bears in a 57-7 routing. Harvard’s win was a major upset against the perennial rugby powerhouse.
“We set very high goals for ourselves in terms of our team energy and team effort, and I think it totally came out on the field,” co-captain Ali Haber said. “It’s what we were looking for. It was incredible to beat Brown. I’m pretty sure we haven’t beaten Brown in like 10 years, according to our alums.”
The Crimson was quick out of the gates, getting its first try on the board when co-captain Brandy Machado powered through the zone less than seven minutes in. The try and subsequent conversion put Harvard up 7-0. Junior Anabiet Abasi and co-captain Brown added scores to help the Crimson’s lead grow to 26-0 before the Bears finally got on the board with a try to round out the first half.
“The biggest thing you could see all over the field was ball retention,” Brown said. “Whenever we had players going into contact, into rucks, or anything, they had players right behind them, and we were clearing Brown out of the way and keeping the ball. That’s what led us to get quick, clean play and move it all around the field so much.”
Despite a commanding 26-7 lead at the half, the Harvard offense continued to surge in the final forty minutes of the game. Brown led the Crimson charge, as the senior picked up three straight tries to start off the second half, for a total of five in the contest.
“The game that we played today was such a good team game,” Brown said. “Every opportunity that we had was created by everyone on the team doing their job, and doing it at a 107,000 percent effort. It was so great to be a part of.”
Diligent practice after last week’s loss resulted in some technical improvements for Harvard, but the big difference-maker in the team’s performance was a rekindled fire and renewed spirit.
“Sometimes to reach higher, you have to fall a little bit lower first,” Haber said. “We’ve always had this potential, but we were just nowhere near that. We realized that, and our coaches helped us realize that. We worked really hard this week, and we are just all on the same page, which came out in the game today.”
The Crimson now has a weekend off to rest up before it hosts Princeton. Harvard hopes to continue to shake up the League standings with a win against another traditional rugby powerhouse.
“Princeton has been our other challenge [besides Brown], at least for the time that I’ve been on the team,” Haber said. “[But] the results of games in the conference have been really whacky relative to the last couple of years. Princeton has already been beaten by Brown and Dartmouth, so we have confidence that we can go out there and do it as well, hopefully keeping up our high level of energy and cohesion on the field. What we’re working on these next two weeks is keeping up that energy, keeping up that effort.”
The Crimson looks to capitalize on its solid play of late and build momentum as it pushes towards the latter part of the season.
“We realize we can do it now,” Haber said. “That’s our standard from here on out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was wacky. It was wild. But in the end, it was another win for the Harvard football team.
Sophomore Paul Stanton finally ended the back-and-forth affair with a 17-yard touchdown run in triple overtime, shedding three would-be tacklers to lift the Crimson, 41-35.
Waiting in the endzone, senior Cam Brate was the first to greet Stanton, lifting him into the Worcester air. It was a fitting image. After all, it was the tight end and back who carried the team to victory after the Harvard defense improbably kept the team in the game.
Eight years had passed since the last time the Crimson won at Holy Cross’ Fitton Field. Stanton was just 11 when Harvard won, 31-21, back in 2005. The Crusaders scored with 19 seconds left to win by three in 2007. In 2009, a Collier Winters fumble sealed a Holy Cross victory, and a Winters interception did Harvard in two years ago.
All of this is to say that you shouldn’t judge the Crusaders based on last year’s 52-3 embarrassment at Harvard Stadium. That was the anomaly, not the norm. Holy Cross proved its worth last week by upsetting Dartmouth, and came ready to play again on Saturday.
It’s hard to say the same thing about the Harvard offense, which started at a snail’s pace. The Crimson accrued fewer than 90 yards in the first half, and junior David Bicknell was called on to punt eight times in the contest. He had punted just four times in the first two weeks.
Junior quarterback Conner Hempel opened the game 0-for-3 with an interception before leaving with a hyperextended knee. Until Hempel returned midway through the third, senior Michael Pruneau struggled similarly, throwing for just 49 yards, though he was 8-for-10 and under center for Harvard’s only offensive score of the first half. The only man that seemed capable of moving the ball on the natural grass was Stanton, who finished the day with 103 rushing yards and 55 receiving yards to go with two touchdowns.
Though the Crimson offense couldn’t find traction, the defense kept Harvard in the game once again. Defenders forced and fell on four Holy Cross fumbles. Early in the third quarter, sophomore Eric Medes corralled one of those loose balls in the endzone, giving Harvard a 14-7 lead and tying the offense and defense, who both had scored a touchdown to that point. Junior Norman Hayes also blocked a field goal, though the Harvard offense couldn’t take advantage of the great field position.
Actually, the Crimson wouldn’t score again until the final minute of regulation. In the meantime, Holy Cross put together two long drives for a combined 160 yards, the second of which put the Crusaders up, 21-14, with just over 3:11 minutes left. Holy Cross had found a crack in the resolute Harvard defense, and now the pressure was on the Crimson offense.
On the ensuing kickoff, sophomore Andrew Fischer slipped at the 16-yard line, meaning Harvard would have to drive 84 yards, nearly as many as it accumulated in the entire first half.
Hempel looked unfazed by the pressure as he took the field. The drive started with two runs as the offense didn’t seem concerned about the ticking clock. On a game-altering third down, Hempel evaded defenders, scrambling for 10 yards and a crucial first down. On the next play, he found senior Andrew Berg streaking down the sideline for a 38-yard gain.
After a six-yard Stanton run, Hempel took a snap from the 10-yard line. Dropping back, he seemed to immediately know where he was going to throw the ball. Brate broke off the line and faced bracket coverage—a defensive back stayed on his right hip while a linebacker blanketed his left side. It didn’t matter.
Hempel double-clutched as Brate broke to the inside and into the middle of the endzone. Hempel threw it up, following his motto, “Force it to Brate.” If you watch the replay enough, you might see Brate push one of the defenders off with his right arm, but no yellow flags appear as the ball somehow finds Brate’s hands, and vice versa. The senior tapped one foot in the back of the endzone to tie the game at 21 and send it to overtime.
In extra time, the Harvard offense finally came alive, scoring on its first two possessions. Holy Cross did the same. Including each team’s final drive of regulation, they both had scored touchdowns on three straight possessions at that point. What was a defensive grind for so long had become a shootout so quickly.
But then things returned to normal.
The Crusaders got the ball first in triple overtime, but they didn’t get far. A sack and an incompletion forced a 45-yard field goal that Holy Cross missed wide left, setting up Stanton’s game-winning scamper on the ensuing possession.
It took three overtime periods and over three hours but the Harvard offense and defense were finally in sync just in time to move the Crimson to 3-0.

UPDATED: October 6, 2013, at 12:53 a.m.
With punch season now in full swing, it’s time to present the results of Flyby’s first-ever Final Club Survey. The online survey was emailed out last month to 4,838 sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and was partially or fully completed 1,927 times (though it should be noted that individuals could have taken the survey more than once). In the fifth installment of a six-part series on the survey results, we take a look at perceptions related to the social scene at Harvard’s final clubs. 
Whether or not you’re in a final club, our survey suggests that male final clubs are likely among your weekend party destinations at least some of the time. Thirty-nine percent of respondents said they go to male final club parties at least once a month, compared to just 35 percent who said they don’t go at all.
If you do choose to go to a male final club party, whom and what are you going to see there? Are they full of decadent debauchery, or are they secretly tamer than freshman formal? Read on to find out what survey respondents had to say.
THE PARTYGOERS
According to our survey, those of you who do go to male final clubs apparently can’t get enough. Respondents who said they go to male final clubs with any regularity were most likely to say they head there at least once a week.
Respondents’ answers about how often they frequent male final clubs varied based on their self-reported gender, sexuality, and class year.
Men were far more likely than women to report that they never attend parties at male final clubs, with 45 percent of men saying they don’t go, compared to just 25 percent of women.
Respondents who identify as homosexual were underrepresented among self-identified male final club partygoers. Fifty-five percent of respondents who identified as homosexual said they never go to male final club parties, compared to just 33 percent of respondents who said they are heterosexual.
Our survey didn’t poll freshmen, so we can’t weigh in on the veracity of the stereotype of the freshman prowl. Our survey did tell us, however, that among this year’s sophomores, juniors, and seniors, you’re most likely to bump into someone from the Class of 2015 at a male final club party—35 percent of them said they go to male final club parties at least twice a month. In comparison, 23 percent of respondents in the Class of 2016 and 34 percent in the Class of 2014 said they can be found out and about at a male club at least twice a month.
Flyby also asked whether members of final clubs belong to fraternities or sororities, and it seems that some survey respondents just can't seem to get enough of exclusive, single-sex spaces on campus: 9 percent of respondents said they are in both a final club and a fraternity or sorority.
PARTIES, BOOZE, AND DRUGS
 
Fifty-eight percent of male respondents indicated that they want to be in one of the male clubs—and our results suggest that it’s not just for the connections. Among respondents who said they have never been a member of a final club, a greater percentage expressed interest in joining the same club that they believe holds the best parties than in joining the same club they believe serves the best alcohol.
Whether or not the reputation is deserved, some male and female final clubs are seen as spaces in which drug use is prevalent. In line with this perception, only 6 percent of survey respondents said they do not think drug culture is pervasive at any of the male clubs. Respondents were less likely to associate female clubs with drug culture, with 17 percent saying they do not believe drug culture pervades any of the female clubs. Even a majority of those who self-reported as current members of a final club agreed that there is some kind of drug culture associated with the clubs, with only 10 percent reporting that they do not think there is a pervasive drug culture at any of the male clubs. Self-reported current final club members were also less likely to say that drug culture is pervasive at any of the female final clubs, with 25 percent saying they do not believe drug culture is prevalent at any female club.

It’s true that I neglected to clean Mr. Snuggles’ fish tank for 14 months, but now that we’re separated, I really miss him.
  
My life changed on December 16, 2011. I received Mr. Snuggles, my first pet, a cuddly, warm beta fish. My secret Santa gave me Snuggles and he was immediately welcomed into my family. Never having had a pet before (besides the occasional pet caterpillar or monarch butterfly), everyone was very eager to give this beta the red carpet treatment. Snuggles received seven Christmas presents in total from my parents, my sister, and my friend Lauren. I hung a small stocking for him, and Santa filled it with a Buddha tank toy.
 
Over time, however, I will admit that the quality of my care decreased. First, the tank light burned out and I never changed it, leaving my precious pet in the dark. Then, I left Snuggles alone for three and a half weeks, without food or a pet sitter. Oh, and I didn’t change the water or clean the fish tank for 14 months.
 
Somehow, Snuggles survived.
 
While my poor care would suggest that I am not very concerned with Snuggles’ well-being, absence truly makes the heart grow fonder and I genuinely miss the company of my small purple fish at college. For pet owners, leaving behind beloved animals is difficult. A friend of mine can only finish homework with the help of her dog. For every problem she completes, for every paragraph she writes, her parents send her a video of her poodle. While I’m not sure that the promise of a video of Snuggles would help me do my work (since the tank was so dirty I never really actually saw Snuggles much anyways), I miss his presence very much. I can’t wait to reunite when I’m home over Thanksgiving and, for Snuggles’ sake, I hope my sister is cleaning the tank. 
 
For those of you missing your pets at home, Flyby has a few suggestions for how to cope with the separation.
 
1) Facetime. While your roommates are video chatting with their long distance boyfriends or girlfriends, don’t be afraid to spend a little time catching up with your pet. No one even has to know that you’re Skyping an animal. Floormmates will just assume that you’re a teen mom if they hear cries of “I miss my baby!” or just another needy girl whining to her sweetheart, saying “Why can’t you just visit me? Is that too much to ask?!”
 
2) Visit the petting zoo! While no animal may compare to your pet, cuddling with another adorable creature will make you feel better. I got to hold a bunny last week and it reminded me of the time Snuggles slipped from my bare hands and onto the hard marble floor the first (and only) time I cleaned the tank.
 
3) Don’t be afraid to approach random dog walkers. Buy dog treats to carry in your pockets and you'll make some new animal (and people) friends instantly.
