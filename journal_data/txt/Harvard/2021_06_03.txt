After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rapper J. Cole’s sixth studio album, “The Off-Season,” was released on May 14 after having been in the works for the past 3 years. Amid the countless statements the rapper makes on this record — which packs a powerful punch in just 39 minutes — “The Off-Season” is first and foremost a reflection of Cole’s unyielding growth.
The intro track, “95.south,” calls out the new generation of clout-chasing rappers who dominate the mainstream by prioritizing style over substance. With shots like “your thirty-song album do a measly hundred thou',” this track introduces a boastful and superior tone that Cole maintains for the entirety of the record. He doesn’t stop there, hitting back at the haters with lines like “if you broke and clownin' a millionaire, the joke is on you” on “applying.pressure.” To follow that heavy-hitting, bar-spitting energy, the track “my.life'' with 21 Savage and Morray is a pure party starter. With Morray’s backup vocals mimicking the duo’s previous collaboration on the single “a lot,” the soulful quality of this track blends well with the story of a traumatic childhood spent on the streets. Befitting a rapper who is truly in a league of his own, the beat of all these songs is powerfully energetic, with producers Cam'ron and Lil Jon hyping up the tracks.
The production behind this album as a whole is stronger and bolder than its predecessors.
Producer tags include household names like Timbaland and Cole himself, resulting in heavy beats that complement rather than dominate Cole’s flow. The intensity of such powerful production matches the veracity of Cole’s bold claim that he is constantly peaking. Furthermore, the addition of star-studded features from a select few artists like 21 Savage, Bas, 6LACK, and Lil Baby is a somewhat surprising move in the scheme of Cole’s consistently self-subsistent discography. The intentionality behind this power move is all the more proof that Cole isn’t one-dimensional, while not disrupting the scheme of self-focused improvement the album strives to portray.
Meanwhile, songs like “amari,” “pride.is.the.devil” featuring Lil Baby, and “hunger.on.the.hillside” featuring Bas sport a more lowkey beat, with melodic undertones that soothe the powerful rapping style. They also see Cole experimenting and branching out into some symphonic composition, as well as including samples characteristic of rappers like Gunna and Aminé — all speaking to the fluid and innovative style of music Cole can adapt to. These buffering instrumentals don’t take away from the rapping style, however, offering some variety to the more trap-heavy beats that dominate the rest of the album.
“One more time before I leave, before I’m fulfilled in this game, let me try to reach a new height from a skill level standpoint,” Cole said in Applying Pressure: The Off-Season Documentary. The punchy verses in “100.mil’” and “punchin’.the.clock” reflect that sentiment of constant self-improvement, preaching an introspective outlook on life exalted by Cole’s tirelessly changing flow. That self-reflective attitude is a thematic concept that also appears in songs like “let.go.my.hand” featuring 6LACK and Bas. In the line “my last scrap was with Puff Daddy,” Cole is referencing his 2013 feud with rapper Diddy, whom he idolized as a child and who is now in the album’s song credits. In these tracks, Cole reveals that “training and conditioning” are the true motivators behind all of his personal and performative growth, as well as the real reasons why his boundless creativity has no end in sight.
“The Off-Season” refers to a period in an athlete’s career when they hone their skills and improve their game, alluding to the constant grind which took place during Cole’s hiatus. The two previously released songs encapsulate that overarching attitude of the album. While “interlude” represents the self-confidence of Cole at the top of his game, the lead single “the.climb.back” conversely illustrates the laborious and intensive uphill battle he’s fought throughout his career to get there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Approximately 30 Harvard dining workers and supporters rallied in front of the Law School Tuesday to protest potential layoffs as the school ends its contract with dining services contractor Restaurant Associates later this month.
In January, the Law School announced that it was terminating its contract with Restaurant Associates and transitioning its food services in-house to Harvard University Dining Services by July 1. UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that represents Harvard’s directly-hired and contracted dining workers, organized Tuesday’s rally in response to concerns that HUDS would pursue a “big layoff” during the transition, according to union organizer Ed B. Childs.
The group marched to Griswold Hall, where union members, shop stewards, and Cambridge City Councilor Marc C. McGovern gave short speeches outlining their concern that the workers could face layoffs as they re-apply for positions after the transition. The rally ended after chief shop steward Eugene Van Buren left a voice message for the office of Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82.
“We have people working for just as long as anyone else at Harvard,” Van Buren said in the message. “We got people working 10, 20, almost 30 years. There’s no need for us to apply for a job that we can do.”
At the rally, Maria A. Montamo, who has been working in dining services at the Law School for three years, and Maria Jeronimo, who has been working there for 12 years, said they have to support their families and children and can not risk losing their jobs.
“I’m a single mother with three kids, so I’m the one who supports the house and I’m the one who brings everything to the house,” Montamo said.
According to Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton, HUDS hopes to conditionally offer positions at the Law School before the contract with Restaurant Associates ends July 1.
Restaurant Associates workers at the Law School received an email Wednesday from HUDS detailing next steps in the transition. Employees who want to continue working at Harvard under HUDS will “need to complete the Harvard employment process,” according to the email. In addition, they will need to come to one of three meetings at the Law School, hosted on June 8, 9, and 10. Workers who do not apply within the timeframe will not be considered for HUDS positions.
“HUDS would welcome the opportunity to meet any interested individuals, to talk about how HUDS will be operating the foodservice at HLS, and to complete the formal paperwork required for [the] Harvard employment process,” the email reads. “At the conclusion of the meet-and-greet timeframe, based on seniority and a skills assessment, positions will be offered.”
Positions are conditional “on the ability to pass a standard Harvard background check,” according to the email.
Local 26 chief shop steward Laquiesha N. Rainey said she is concerned the background checks could result in workers being laid off if they have minor offenses on their records, such as arrests at union protests, despite decades of service at the Law School.
UNITE HERE Local 26 President Carlos Aramayo said the union will continue to support the Restaurant Associates workers during the transition.
“UNITE HERE Local 26 stands with the workers at the Harvard Law School in their efforts to make sure that every worker who wants to continue to be employed at Harvard University is allowed to do so and will oppose any action by the University to permanently lay off workers from the Law School,” he said.
In an emailed statement, McGovern said he will “support the union” in any way possible.
“I hope that by showing the Law School that there is a great deal of support for the workers that they will change their position and treat these front line workers with the respect and dignity they deserve,” he wrote.
Rainey said the union may hold other actions to protest the transition procedure. Harvard’s dining workers are also in the middle of negotiating a new contract, and she added that the union would continue to push for job security at the bargaining table.
“We want to ensure that everybody still has a job,” she said.
In an emailed statement, Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal thanked the dining workers.
“We are grateful to Restaurant Associates and, in particular, to its many employees, who have served our community well over these years,” Neal wrote. “And we are looking forward to seeing many of them again when campus dining facilities reopen in the fall for the first time in a year and a half.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard announced Wednesday that Manuel Cuevas-Trisán will take over as the University’s Vice President of Human Resources following the departure of several high-profile administrators, including the school’s HR head.
Cuevas-Trisán, who currently serves as the VP for Human Resources at Northwestern University, will take over for current HR Vice President Marilyn Hausammann — one of three key figures who has announced their departure from Harvard’s central administration in recent weeks.
The University announced on May 19 that Hausammann and longtime Vice President and University Chief Information Officer Anne H. Margulies would retire at the end of May. Separately, Richard D. McCullough, Harvard’s vice provost for research, was tapped last week to serve as president of Florida State University.
Cuevas-Trisán, a graduate of the University of Notre Dame and the University of Puerto Rico School of Law, led several social justice initiatives at Northwestern, including anti-racism training for top administrators and a university-wide “diverse candidate slates” policy aimed at boosting diverse hiring at the school.
“He is well-suited to guide the University’s efforts to build on our strong Harvard human resources foundation in establishing a progressive approach to recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce of talented individuals, strengthening access to development opportunities, and ensuring Harvard can thrive in our support for our employees in the workplace of the future,” University Vice President Katherine N. Lapp said of Cuevas-Trisán in a press release announcing his hire.
Hausammann had served as HR VP since 2004.
Margulies had served as Harvard’s CIO since 2010 and helped champion the creation of the free online education platform edX, which Harvard and MIT launched in 2012. In a press release announcing their departures, Lapp lauded Hausammann and Margulies as leaving “big shoes to fill.”
“The University will miss their leadership, yet we can be reassured that Anne and Marilyn have built lasting foundations during their tenures here, which I have no doubt will continue into the future,” Lapp said in the release.
McCullough, Harvard’s outgoing vice provost for research, was selected unanimously by Florida State’s Board of Trustees as the school’s 16th president last Monday.
At Harvard, McCullough led the University’s academic research initiatives and oversaw more than 25 institutes, centers, and initiatives.
“I have expanded Harvard’s influence and the scope of our impact through building visionary interdisciplinary research and education initiatives across Harvard and with multiple world-leading hospitals, corporations, and some of the best academic institutions,” McCullough wrote to FSU’s presidential search committee in a May 7 public letter expressing his interest in the job.
“Although decentralization has meant greater challenges in finding common ground in planning for our university’s future, I have found that building trusted relationships has been the key to creating new partnerships and collaborations, improving Harvard’s standing in the world,” he added.
McCullough — who previously served as vice president for research at Carnegie Mellon University — was one of three finalists for FSU president presented to the school’s Board of Trustees by a 15-person Presidential Search Advisory Committee, which considered 35 applicants.
His selection is pending the approval of the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the state’s public universities. The body will consider his selection on June 23.
