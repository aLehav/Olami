Quite possibly the best episode of Season Four, “USS Callister” is an underdog story for the ages. Its heroine, Nanette Cole (Cristin Milioti), is one desperately needed in the flood of 21st century male-driven narratives. She’s a brilliant programmer, fiercely determined, and the perfect person to break her and her coworkers out of one man’s deeply misogynist fantasy.
Nanette wakes up in an artificially lit chamber one day, confused about her “Star Trek”-esque surroundings. She then learns that she is onboard the USS Callister, a virtual starship programmed by Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons), one of her sci-fi-obsessed managers from the real world. Robert has taken the DNA of Nanette and some of his coworkers, and replicated their consciousness in this virtual landscape, with him as their god. He forces them on his own ego-stroking missions, using them as objects to play with and torment.
This is a lot for Nanette to take in—Robert has robbed them of their lives, their free will, and even their genitalia. A coworker points out that in this virtual world, a Barbie-doll-like blankness exists where their reproductive anatomy should. There’s a lot of weighty symbolism involved in this scene pertaining to the sexual entitlement Robert feels in this imbalanced gender-power dynamic, but Nanette sums it up best: “Stealing my pussy is a red fucking line,” she says with bared teeth. “We’re going to get this bastard.”
It’s so refreshing to see Nanette turn the tables on Robert, but social relevance isn’t the only virtue of “USS Callister.” “Black Mirror” commits to its story as much as it commits to the “Star Trek” aesthetic, pulling no punches when it comes to Robert’s imagined cruelty. It’s difficult to find a show that can stride the line between necessity and excess, but “USS Callister” manages this well. It finds the spots where narrative anguish is needed, and pushes its boundaries so the plot doesn’t lose its edge, but not to the point of theatrics.
But perhaps the most brilliant part of “USS Callister” is its switch of narrative authority. The episode’s exposition is purposefully misleading, fooling us into believing that Robert will be the hero of this story. But the true heroine emerges just six minutes into the show, a seemingly inconspicuous side character who ends up wielding control over Robert’s own fabricated science fiction. At the end of “USS Callister,” Nanette sits in what used to be Captain Robert’s old chair with earned confidence, reminding us of the tricky thing about narratives—fiction or otherwise. Narratives are meant to be read, reread, revised, and sometimes tossed away in hyperwarp. It’s a new era, Nanette’s sly smile seems to say. And not just for the crew aboard the USS Callister.

The fault with “Arkangel” lies in its inability to commit to its own terms. When Marie Sambrell (Rosemarie DeWitt) is introduced, it’s clear that her hyper-protective nature will draw some sort of divide between her and her daughter, Sara (Brenna Harding). Initially, it seems that “Black Mirror” will run its usual intense course, especially when Marie has a controversial neural implant installed in Sara’s head in order to monitor her daughter’s every move and even filter out stressful content from her vision.
As Sara grows older, Marie realizes that the neural implant—the Arkangel—is doing more harm than good, stunting her emotional growth and ability to respond to necessarily stressful events. She promises to stop using Arkangel, but that’s when the show loses its trademark “Black Mirror” emotional strength. Rather than being a full exploration of the complications of protective instincts and rebellious teenagehood, “Arkangel” comes off as more of a warning label for helicopter parenting instead. It just doesn’t have the same moral twists that other “Black Mirror” episodes tend to have.
The dramatic weight of its final scene feels unearned. Marie does micromanage Sara’s life to a horrifying extent, going as far as putting an “emergency contraceptive” in her breakfast, but the episode’s philosophy and emotional potency simply don’t live up to the premise’s potential. “Arkangel” wants to be a cautionary tale against pushing too hard, and thus inadvertently pushing your loved ones away. But it shouldn't take its family advice for its writing—what’s the point in watching if you don’t push your story at all?

“Black Mirror” normally finds its power in confrontation. Its best episodes push the question of “What if?” What if we could rate people in real-time, with a society-wide version of Uber ratings? What if we could bring back our loved ones from the dead, despite better judgement? What if we had the technology to take our worst fears or desires, and turn them into reality?
“Crocodile” tries to use this formula as it follows a successful scientist, Mia Nolan (Andrea Riseborough), as she tries to cover up one murder by murdering more people: What if surveillance made it easy to find killers? What if the killer seems like a good person with a family? But its lackluster plot matches its lackluster questions, disappointing very quickly. As with other episodes, “Crocodile” tries to capitalize on our culture’s growing technological paranoia, but falls flat. The surveillance system of this world depends on a memory-extracting system, which can definitely have moral repercussions (a concept explored in Season One’s “The Entire History of You”). In this episode, however, it’s highly supervised and fairly harmless—unless you’ve just killed a person.
In that case, the emotional work of the episode relies on Riseborough, who does the best she can with the limited range she’s given. Mia is either wracked with terror or wracked with guilt. She never evolves over the course of the episode, and we rarely see her outside of a criminal context. It’s apparent that her life with her family is important to her—the most emotionally potent scene is when Mia cries silently as she watches her son perform in the school play, heavy with guilt. But because “Crocodile” never truly expands on Mia’s character aside from the homicide, the homicide is all she is.
“Crocodile” is all gore and shock with no substance. Aside from some dreamy shots of Icelandic scenery, it’s dull watching Mia descend into this linear, murderous path, as she refuses to spiral, to change, or to ascend from the base instinct of survival.

In 1971, The Washington Post gained national acclaim for its bold publication of secrets that the U.S. government kept about the Vietnam War. Steven Spielberg centers “The Post” on the leadership of the Washington Post, still a small “local paper” at the time, and its decisions leading up to the publication of the Pentagon Papers. Though not an entirely accurate documentation of history, “The Post” is nonetheless a satisfying and timely depiction that traces the weeks of breaking headlines and the eventual release of the confidential documents.
The film hones in on Washington Post publisher Katharine “Kay” Graham (Meryl Streep) and the Post’s executive editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), who struggle to publish the Pentagon Papers. These highly classified papers entail a research project conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense. They reveal that the government knew the Vietnam War was, in all likelihood, a lost cause. With an all-star crew, Spielberg conveys an important message of the press’s freedom in the First Amendment, interwoven with underlying themes of female empowerment and the balance of work and personal life for high-profile individuals like Graham.
Katharine Graham is, needless to say, a complicated character in her own right. Luckily, Meryl Streep’s skilled performance handles the role’s complexity with care. Streep is a natural as she evokes the entertainer within and the maternal side of Graham with classic poise, charm, and wit. However, some of Graham’s weaker moments are less natural coming from Streep, especially her deadlocked silence amidst all-male boards and stock owners. Though her unfamiliarity in such a position manifests in curt dialogue, Streep’s majestic smile and stance naturalizes Graham’s leadership in female empowerment.
Graham’s actions make her a female role model throughout the film, in the eyes of Bradlee’s wife (Sarah Paulson), a staff worker in the courts, and amid the crowd of women that she steps into after the Supreme Court hearing between the press and the White House. She remains devoted to the Washington Post as a family business, and as one of the pioneering women of the publishing industry. Yet pressure builds as she plans to take the Post public in the American Stock Exchange, particularly with advisors and investors lacking confidence in her leadership as a woman. Graham’s reluctance and swaying inability to make large decisions for the Washington Post without consulting her strong-headed advisors vanishes when she gives the green light to publish the Pentagon Papers. Though her decision is an uncertain one, it profoundly impacts the press and its First Amendment rights.
As Graham’s accomplice, Hanks’ performance as Ben Bradlee echoes with spirit and feistiness. His gusto for freedom of the press and for promoting the Washington Post to something more than “the town paper” drives much of the plot in the film. As much as Bradlee calls out Graham for her close relationships to top officials in D.C., Hanks also reveals an internal struggle of Bradlee’s own past with the government. Even as Bradlee reminisces sadly on a framed photograph of him and his close friend John F. Kennedy—whom he refers to fondly as Jack—he later tells Graham that “those days have to be over.”
Despite Graham and Bradlee’s heroic decision, the film leaves little room to show any change in the characters after they publish the Pentagon Papers. The rest of the film disappointedly skips over what happened to their close-knit relationships as a result of the publication of the Pentagon Papers, especially Graham’s tension with close friend Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.
The film’s strengths lie in its soundtrack and screenplay to bring back a different age of journalism. The loading of the newspaper stacks and cigarettes in the newsroom further accentuate the tensions Graham grapples with and the conflicts of interest inherent in publishing close sources. As the clanks of the machinery systematically press on for the next day’s paper, composer John Williams’ melodies draw out the impending uncertainty that the new headlines would produce. Williams’ score once again rings with sweet tones, and the music helps build suspense in the film, especially in scenes of monologue. Screenwriters Josh Singer (co-writer of “Spotlight”) and Liz Hannah succinctly weave together a witty script of a complex timeline of events. Though cleverly crafted, the tongue-in-cheek spirit of many conversations throughout the film fell short of laughs.
Despite its slightly awkward humor, the film resounds as much as its title. The out-of-touch jokes and this dramatized recall of history are just side-notes to this film’s clear, directive commentary on today’s relationship between the U.S. government and the media. With President Trump’s constant criticism of the media and the American Dialect Society’s naming of “fake news” as 2017’s word of the year, Spielberg brings together some of Hollywood’s top and classic talents as a recount and a reminder of the power of the press.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six new resident fellows—including former Republican Virginia gubernatorial candidate Edward W. Gillespie—will join the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics this spring.
This semester's class of fellows also includes former national press secretary for the Bernie Sanders campaign Symone D. Sanders and former chairman and president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States Fred P. Hochberg. Rounding out the batch are J. Scott Jennings, former special assistant to President George W. Bush and current CNN contributor, Elizabeth A. Hodges, the former mayor of Minneapolis, and Adam Conner, an account executive at technology company Slack.
Chosen fellows will lead weekly discussions called “study groups” in their respective areas while also engaging students in other types of events. Study group topics this semester comprise the process through which ideas become public policy, racial equity involving policing and local governance, as well as millennials, progressives, and the future of the Democratic Party.
Abigail P. Bloomfield ’20, a student chair of the IOP’s Fellows and Study Groups, said she thinks the spring fellow program offers career professionals the chance to stimulate student engagement with public life.
“The fellows are really great because they bring perspectives that do not necessarily exist within the academic sphere,” Bloomfield said. “They can broaden our understandings of what politics looks like, what policy looks like and how we can apply what we’re learning in the classroom into the real world.”
Jennings, whose study group will focus on the status of the two-party system and the rise of what he calls “tribalism,” said he is excited to join the fellows and to bring his own cultural and political perspective to the students and faculty at the IOP.
“I’m somebody from middle America who believes strongly that we need to have greater understanding among different places in this country because it strikes me that we are growing apart,” Jennings said.
This spring fellows class will bring perspectives from across the political spectrum. Honorees include longtime members of both the Republican and Democratic parties.
“I look forward to welcoming an exceptional group of political practitioners, policymakers, and social activists who will provide students with a broad spectrum of perspectives and direct opportunities to participate in respectful dialogue and provide unique insight,” IOP Acting Director William D. Delahunt said in a press release announcing the spring fellows.
The Kennedy School attracted controversy last semester for its visiting fellow program—a similar initiative that brings individuals with experience in the public sector to campus for shorter periods of time.
After backlash from high-ranking current and former CIA officials, the IOP revoked its offer of a visiting fellowship to Chelsea Manning, a transgender activist and former U.S. Army soldier who was imprisoned after disclosing over 700,000 classified government documents.
Following the incident, the Kennedy School said it would reassess how it uses the “fellow” title and how to bestow the honor on invited guests in the future.
The visiting fellows program also came under scrutiny for its decision last semester to hold only off-the-record events for then-visiting fellow Sean Spicer, President Donald Trump’s former press secretary.
Jennings emphasized he is open to holding many on-the-record events during his time on Harvard’s campus as a resident fellow.
“I have found that having on the record public events, public discussions, public debates and challenging sort of interactions in the public space to be very stimulating and fun and important,” Jennings said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ongoing global debate about sexual assault and misconduct may cause the search committee looking for Harvard’s next president to vet candidates more extensively, experts say.
Over the last few months, mass allegations of sexual assault have taken down powerful men in industries ranging from Hollywood to newsrooms to workplaces around the world. The stream of accusations, which began with allegations against media mogul Harvey Weinstein in Oct. 2017, sparked a social media campaign asking women to post stories of sexual harassment and assault with the hashtag #MeToo.
Higher education search experts say the #MeToo movement means universities seeking new leadership may increase their scrutiny of potential candidates. Recruiters, both in higher education and in corporate boardrooms, are likely taking extra care to avoid hiring someone with a history of sexual misconduct, according to analysts.
Jan Greenwood, president of the higher education search firm Greenwood/Asher & Associates, said she thinks the growth of the #MeToo movement could make extensive vetting a common practice in executive searches.
“As issues get more exposed and dealt with appropriately, then that will lead to broader and deeper and more on-target background checks,” Greenwood said.
The heightened scrutiny for sexual misconduct comes as Harvard nears the ninth month of its search for its 29th president. The search, conducted by a 15-person search committee, began when University President Drew G. Faust announced over the summer she would step down in June 2018. Last month, the committee narrowed its shortlist to under 20 candidates. 
Ted Webb, a search expert at Ford Webb Associates who recruits for both public and private sector organizations, said he thinks the #MeToo movement will almost certainly affect Harvard’s search. He added he thinks possible alterations will ultimately improve the University’s selection process.
“The #MeToo movement brings some light, if you will, into who's being hired,” Webb said. “That's a good thing. And maybe it complicates the process a bit, but to me, that's good trouble.”
In particular, Webb said the slew of sexual assault allegations will put “pressure” on recruiters—including Harvard’s searchers—to disqualify people with histories of bad behaviors, whether sexual or more broadly “toxic” and “demeaning” to past coworkers.
“It seems to me that people who behave in this fashion towards women, towards people who are their insubordinates, don't have the kind of character that good leadership requires,” he added.
In a Nov. 2017 interview with the Harvard Gazette, search committee head William F. Lee ’72, senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, listed some of the traits the committee will seek in the University’s next president. He mentioned the committee may look for someone with fundraising experience or someone who has earned prestigious awards like the Nobel Peace Prize.
Paula B. Fazli ’85, a search expert at Sage Search Partners, said she worries potential candidates’ accolades might distract from or obscure their past bad behavior as the search committee seeks to evaluate contenders.
“I think search committee members, and I'm betting this may be true of the Harvard search committee…get lured into thinking that because somebody has a Nobel prize, for instance—or because somebody has worked at Yale or went to Harvard or is a great fundraiser—it's easy to make the assumption that because someone's resume speaks to those things that somehow they're also a good person,” Fazli said.
In the November interview, Lee said the committee will also prioritize “fundamental human characteristics” like integrity, communication skills, and emotional intelligence.
The #MeToo movement has already affected life on Harvard’s campus. In Dec. 2017, complaints of sexual harassment at the University increased by twenty percent compared to 2016, according to the University’s Title IX Office. Administrators said they thought the uptick was likely due to the cultural moment.
In addition, the University is currently facing three Title IX investigations, a challenge Faust will likely pass on to her successor.
Fazli said the #MeToo movement “sits in the center of a lot of policy that affects higher education” as it both encompasses and builds upon the current scrutiny of Harvard’s—and other universities’—sexual harassment policies.
But despite increased federal examination of Harvard’s sexual harassment policies—and despite increased national discussion of sexual harassment in the workplace—Greenwood warned the movement “hasn’t reached everyone.” She said increased vetting by search committees like Harvard’s might not catch everything.
“You could be doing background checks on a person where people have had negative experiences but are not yet talking. So that's always a potential concern,” Greenwood said.

In case you missed it, The Crimson reported this weekend on a clandestine meeting held by some members of the committee tasked with selecting Harvard’s next president. The search committee escaped the gritty streets of Cambridge to the safe haven of Belmont, Mass. on Saturday, and left us with a few (albeit very suburban) clues: a Chevy Suburban, a “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” balloon, and a Vineyard Vines t-shirt. But what were they doing in Belmont for the day? Well, probably some business related to the presidential search, but with them being so hush-hush and tightly secured, one can only speculate. Here are Flyby’s guesses as to what fifteen Harvard overseers could have been up to for seven hours in suburbia.
Holding a Final Club Victory Celebration
	
It took Harvard’s administration nearly two years to shut the book on a debate about campus social groups. In the fall, the Harvard Corporation—whose members sit on the search committee—voted decisively to penalize members of social groups starting with the Class of 2021 (for more on that, read this explainer). It’s only right that after such a long, involved saga, some of Harvard’s top honchos would get together for a ~boozy~ day of commemoration for what will go down in history as one of President Faust’s main accomplishments. But notably missing from the meeting Saturday (as far as we can tell) were Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana…
Throwing Shade
Everyone knows that Harvardians love to throw shade. Could the committee members have eschewed the work of picking the next president for a day to lament the fact that the social group saga took up almost two years of Harvard’s time? And if they went all the way to the suburbs for a day-long gossip sesh, we can bet, in true wine mom fashion, that they spilled as much tea as they drank in rosé.
Comparing Golf Strokes
While previous weeks’ bomb cyclone doesn’t make for great golfing weather, simulators go for about $5,000, and readily fit in a $2.5 million Belmont home, at least more readily than in the committee’s usual meeting place, Loeb House. They would have had time for at least one round of golf, with breaks for lemonade.
Having a Legally Blonde Movie Marathon
The entire franchise—Legally Blonde (96 minutes), Legally Blonde 2: Red, White, and Blonde (95 minutes), Legally Blondes (82 minutes—if they were really ambitious)—can be binged in about four and a half hours. While we can’t really imagine billionaire and private equity tycoon David M. Rubenstein ‘bend-and-snap’ping, he could plausibly rock a pink blazer for this not-so-elitist movie marathon.
Actually Celebrating a Birthday
We’re big fans of political intrigue, so we’ve wondered in the past few days if the “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” balloon outside of Harvard overseer Tracy P. Palandjian’s ‘93 house was a red herring, designed to throw off The Crimson’s “nosy reporters.” After all, Faust has mused in the past about pulling out all the stops to evade us in the last presidential search. But it’s more likely the committee members—who we imagine are buds, if not besties IRL—were celebrating a birthday, with cake, candles and all. They probably didn’t want the quinquagenarian birthday boy or girl’s age getting out, hence the ridiculously tight security measures, and paparazzi-proof face coverage as they left.
Well, so long as the committee remains hidden behind black-tinted SUV windows, all we can do is see their suburban activities through rose-colored glasses.
