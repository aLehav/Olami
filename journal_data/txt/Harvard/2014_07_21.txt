After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Controversial frontman of The Smiths and innovator of indie music, Morrissey is something of a spectacle and an enigma. But those hoping to understand more about Morrissey from his latest album, “World Peace is None of Your Business,” will face disappointment. If his previous release, 2009’s rocking and fiery “Years of Refusal,” was explosive, “World Peace” is almost one-dimensional in its charged character. The result is an unrelenting odyssey into the self-assertive character that is Morrissey—a world that while initially fascinating becomes exhausting.
Musically, the album delivers. Creative orchestration provides the tracks with harmonious beats and occasionally head-banging character. The instruments nimbly switch from classic rock to acoustic with a twinge of country in songs like “Neal Cassady Drops Dead” and “Istanbul.” Operatic singing fills the parts of “Earth is the Loneliest Planet.” Cymbals, electronic squeaks and rumbles, the beat of marchers, string twinges, synthetic scratches—a wide range of sounds make cameos, collectively complimenting Morrissey’s saccharine voice. “Kick the Bride Down the Aisle” epitomizes this melodic success. From the pervasive organ to the brief chiming of wedding bells, the sounds in the song pay homage to the theme of marriage. And as Morrissey sings the chorus about the bride’s desires, a falsetto voice accompanies him as if the bride herself agrees with his cynical sentiments. The addition of Spanish and Western flair, courtesy of the guitar, gives the song a triumphant flourish.
Robust and upbeat accompanying music enjoys prevalence in most of Morrissey’s album. This light character, however, offers a startling and ironic contrast to the less-than-chipper lyrics that Morrissey espouses. If any evidence of the musician’s notorious cynicism is needed, look no further than the titular track. Within the first few minutes of the album, Morrissey states, “World peace is none of your business / Police will you stun with their stun guns / Or they’ll disable you with tasers / That’s what government’s for.” From the album’s beginning, Morrissey seeks to express his deepest beliefs, and he carries through on this promise with a caustic gusto. “The Bullfighter Dies” channels Morrissey’s passion for animal activism as he celebrates a bullfighter’s death while “Nobody cries / Because we all want the bull to survive.” Meanwhile, his distrust towards matrimony surfaces in “Kick the Bride Down the Aisle,” another track that showcases Morrissey’s beliefs.
This biting sentiment defines “World Peace.” Most notable in its lack of warmth is “Neal Cassady Drops Dead.” While the track begins in typical Morrissey fashion with a nostalgic reminder of the British singer’s love of including literary and cultural references in his songs, it soon turns into a shocking diatribe about diseased children. “Everyone has babies / Babies full of rabies / Rabies full of scabies / Scarlet has a fever,” Morrissey proclaims with his famously imaginative wit. With such tracks, “World Peace” traverses into pessimistic, politically charged territory. And while social commentary gives albums depth, the problem is that Morrissey is too blatant. He presents his opinions with little subtlety, so that the album becomes a relentless barrage of bias that strips the listener of room to think or even contemplate the complex issues Morrissey discusses.
To read “World Peace” as one man’s attempt to make his zealous philosophies heard, however, is erroneous. The album contains splotches of profound thought and introspection, rare gems in an otherwise one-sided production. The album’s final track, “Oboe Concerto,” replaces Morrissey’s previously dominant buoyancy for a surprising sensitivity and candor as he sings “Oboe concerto / All I do is drink to absent friends” and “The older generation have tried, sighed, and died / Which pushes me to their place in the queue.” An accompanying saxophone cements the song’s pop-ballad style and lends it a morose quality. He even sings in a softer and more melancholic manner, compared to his louder renditions in “Kick the Bride Down the Aisle” or “Neal Cassady Drops Dead,” drawing out the end of his phrases and pausing at moments. “Oboe Concerto” reflects a musician’s self-awareness about his duty as an aging artist trying to be successful in a different time. As he repeats “Round, round, rhythm of life goes round” to steady drum beats and synthetic noises, Morrissey creates a sense of finality. The song is a startling conclusion, not because of any upsetting messages but because of its reflective and genuine tone—one that is both provocative and thoughtful.
Morrissey succeeds in providing an image of himself as an artist in his latest album—but it is ultimately one that lacks complexity. In “World Peace,” Morrissey presents himself as a skeptic, a somewhat disparaging musician, and a staunch activist. And while that picture might be compelling at times, it ends up being too overblown for a completely enjoyable listening experience.

And the auto guy is singing a film song. It is almost raining. Singing, he drives slowly. In Khan Market women huddle under the archway between Fab India and a bookstore; the leaves flicker along Aurangzab Road. The air has the same pre-rain scent, iron and expectation, as the wet-root, weepy climate at home. And when the sky breaks it does so like a strip of fabric tearing, leaving humidity in long, loose fibers dragging against the ground. Don’t bother putting the curtain down, the driver says. It’ll stop soon. The water picks up, starts, slows.
There is the harsh pleasure of rain, and that of almost raining. One night it hardly comes, flagrantly, heat cut through by lightening and the wind’s sharp tongue. The small tipsy party leaving my fan-dizzy room finds the light has faded already; we’ve been in there for hours, ice melting on the tray, singing soul versions of old film songs, smoky Nina Simone. On the balcony the wind is just starting and the lightening cracks, singeing and stingy, chipping the clouds like shells off eggs. The rain stays circumspect; a few chubby drops roll down our eyelashes and elbows, buck dust from the ground. The clothes phantom from the line off the balcony, whipping fast across my arms as I unclip them to bring them inside. A slash of lightning, the line shaking like the halting metro. The ghost of a t-shirt, its flickering shadow, flies into the gali below.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether she was dancing, sending smiley-face text messages to friends, or writing about her travels, Haley A. Rue ’17 took on life with unceasing optimism, friends remembered on Monday.
A native of Tacoma, Washington, and soon-to-be resident of Pforzheimer House, Rue died on Friday while traveling in Germany. She was 19.
Rue, who friends and classmates described as a warm-hearted, adventurous lover of life, died doing what she loved. She was spending the summer traveling through Europe and writing for Let’s Go, a Harvard Student Agencies company that produces travel guides.
“I sat across from my Harvard interviewer at a Starbucks during a winter morning of my senior year and told him that if I could do anything with my life, money not being an object, I would be a nomad,” Rue wrote in a personal description on her blog. “I would not cure anything, discover anything, win anything. I would travel and write.”
Along with her adventurousness, many friends remembered Rue for the positive attitude with which they say she approached life.
“Haley was [like] Harvard in the opening days, when everything is filled with hope and possibility and a vibrant desire to do something noteworthy,” Ariana E. Akbari ’17 wrote in an email. She called Rue her best friend.
Another friend, Akshay Verma ’17, called Rue “the ultimate lover of life.”
“She reminded me countless times to never let life get you down, to enjoy all the little things that we naturally tend not to,” Verma said. “We chatted just a few days ago about how Europe was the perfect place for her and that was where she was happiest.”
Caroline B. Hubbard ’17, who joined The Crimson’s Arts Board with Rue and Verma during the fall of 2013, said her friend had a “magnetic personality” that drew in those around her.
Friends say Rue initially planned on studying economics but later said that she was thinking about concentrating in Visual and Environmental Studies. She worked four or five shifts a week at Anthropologie, a women’s clothing store in Harvard Square.
“We all grew to know and love Haley,” said department manager Andrea Punko, who added that Rue was a reliable leader from her first week on the job. Punko joked that she and her colleagues loved to call Rue “Michelle Obama” for her sassy, but fun-loving personality.
Nadia L. Urrea ’17, who first met Haley when they bonded over the band “alt-J” on the Class of 2017 Facebook page before freshman year, recalled stopping by Anthropologie to greet Haley on the way to rehearsals.
“She was just one of those people who was always happy and even though she had her full workload at school and then she went to work, she was always ready to spend hours talking to you if that’s what you needed,” Urrea said.
Known for comforting friends in difficult times or sending spontaneous text messages, Rue was, many of her friends said, a uniquely genuine person.
“She would text me randomly out of the blue just sending me a bunch of smiley faces and a bunch of different ones, a smiley face, a heart...and then she would just say, ‘this is how I feel about you, this is how you make me feel,’” said Gabriella D. Czarniak ’17, another of Rue’s friends. “I can’t imagine I was the only one receiving those messages.”
Sure enough, after the recent death of Akbari’s grandmother, Rue sent a series of text messages to console her friend.
“I don’t want my funeral to be boring,” Rue wrote in the text message. “I just want the people who show up to be really bizarre and interesting because that will be all my friends.”
Friends, family, and affiliates of Rue’s high school and her church, Our Savior Lutheran Church in Tacoma, held a prayer service on Sunday attended by several hundred people, according to the Tacoma News Tribune. As of the time of publication, the College had not announced any plans for a memorial service of its own.
