After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MIT’s decision to remove the 500-word personal statement from their college application eliminates a crucial piece of the college evaluation and admission process. The decision will make it more challenging for MIT to evaluate its applicants’ writing skills, shifting the burden of expression to three shorter 200-word response essays.
Stuart Schmill, the Dean of Admissions, mentioned that MIT “wanted to remove that larger-than-life qualify to that one essay and take away a bit of the high-stakes nature of that one piece.” This is a worthy intention, but unfortunately, the move will be counterproductive. Students will now lose sleep over how to express themselves in three 200-word segments—in addition to fretting over crafting the perfect 500-word statement still required of other schools. College consultants who used to help write 500 word personal statements will not disappear either, but rather quickly shift their assistance to the short essays.
MIT’s applicants will still bear the same stress that comes with a college application. Unfortunately, they may lose the ability to display their voice and writing skills with this new format. It was already a challenge for applicants to express themselves in a 500-word essay, but it is more difficult to do this in 200 words. Students will be forced to focus almost entirely on content, whereas in the traditional personal statement, they can display their true writing talent.
Verbal abilities are essential for all college students, whether they are aspiring scientists, programmers, or economists. Any scientist or researcher will struggle to be effective if she can’t advocate for her findings. By removing the essay, MIT sends a signal to high-school students that writing and expressive qualities are not as important as concrete achievements. They forget that many of their great alumni, from architect I.M. Pei to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, used their voice to help propel them to the top of their fields.
MIT is nobly trying to remove some of the pressure from students to produce a memorable personal statement, but in the process, it is losing an essential way to evaluate its applicants. A college application is a reflection of the identity of an applicant, an identity that short lists of achievements cannot begin to encapsulate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first priority of any state is to take care of its own citizens. However, nations should also be open to helping the welfare of less advantaged countries who do not have the infrastructure to cope with health outbreaks themselves. Fortunately, these two goals are not incompatible in the case of treating H1N1, which has begun to lay low several Harvard undergraduates and threatens to experience a massive resurgence this fall.
America seems braced for an all-out war on the much-hyped swine flu, having recently ordered 250 million vaccines in preparation for the flu season. But what about developing nations that can’t even afford to treat diseases with high mortality rates, let alone influenzas that much of the public doubts pose serious threats?  The UN expressed concerns in a recent statement, urging the world’s wealthier nations to donate more vaccines to help stop the impending epidemic. The United States, Brazil, and France have all agreed to donate 10 percent of their vaccine stockpiles to other nations, with manufacturers providing an additional 150 million vaccines, but in the face of H1N1 potentially reaching a third of the population, this may not be sufficient.
Nations may recognize political boundaries, but diseases won’t be stopped by lines on a map. The spread of H1N1 into the United States from Mexico, where it has been far more devastating, is a testament to this fact. Diseases will not decide to avoid transmitting themselves from a Mexican to an American vacationing in Cancun simply because of her national allegiance, nor are they particularly deterred by massive GDPs. The fight against H1N1 is a global one, which requires more of a commitment by wealthier nations in order to avoid its spread. Such a commitment is not only a sign of benevolence toward poorer nations, but also an investment in the health of their own populations.
Poorer nations simply do not have the robust health infrastructures necessary to deal with massive outbreaks, even if they are anticipated in advance. When any epidemic looms on the horizon, the first priority should be to treat the disease in a systemic fashion that beats it into submission from all fronts, not just those in the first world. In a globalized world, this should be the rule for treating health threats, not the exception. The efforts made so far are a good start and demonstrate good intentions on the part of wealthy nations, but good intentions alone don’t save lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The season is changing in New England, and it’s not just because of something as arbitrary as the weather. Major League Baseball’s 2009 playoffs commence today, and it’s time to determine your loyalty.
What happens when two regions face off, determined to subdue the other? In the Old Testament, the men of Gilead asked fugitives if they were from Ephraim, demanding they utter the now-legendary word “Shibboleth.” Those who pronounced anything different became the enemy; 42,000 were slaughtered in the River Jordan.
Update the river to the Charles and test whether sports fans can pronounce the word “destroyer” to rhyme with Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, and we can brace ourselves for another regional clash of Biblical proportions—if we forget our heads and mistake sport for anything more than amusement. Bostonians and Harvard peers often forget civility and manners in their fanatical support for their own team.
Tonight the New York Yankees will commence the American League Division Series, and tomorrow the Boston Red Sox will play. Fans of both teams will fret over those games, but with one eye they’ll inevitably be looking ahead to the next round—when Boston and New York will almost inevitably meet in what looks to be an epic clash.
Over the course of the regular season, the teams go head to head almost 20 times, to the point that the games and their broadcasts seem self-aggrandizing and out of touch.  Ultimately the games become a spectacle for television networks and other commercial interests to milk. A Southern Californian told me just last night how he cheered for the Yankees as a young child simply because they were in the most publicized games on TV.
Bostonians and New Yorkers can never escape the extra scrutiny and attention that their sports teams and their support of those teams seem to attract. But what about college students finding themselves caught in the crossfire? Boston is a major university town—thousands of students congregate here—and surely few opted for Boston thanks only to its sports culture. Throwing one’s support to baseball’s most successful franchise or jumping on the bandwagon of any local team, however, can have serious consequences.
While mixed martial arts and other systemized forms of fighting might be closer to the days of gladiator battles, public crowds at baseball games can turn ugly. Whether it’s a fan provoking others by waving his jersey until inebriated supporters of the opposing team take the bait or a heckler yelling remarks at small children, such a gathering can create a rabid atmosphere in which people lose their sense of decency. This less pleasant side of sports has, in the case of Boston-New York brawls, even extended to the professionals involved, such as a 2003 playoff incident between Boston grounds crew and Yankees players.
Much as most athletes on Toronto sports clubs stand for Canada’s anthem though they only live there temporarily, players are fed into the grinding machine of such a rivalry from unlikely places. This year, if the Yankees and Red Sox face off, Sox Nation will call upon a new hero, Victor Martinez, who several months ago played for Cleveland. He spent most of his career there, and only two years ago faced those same Red Sox in a bitter playoff battle, then cast as a villain. He will face CC Sabathia, who also played on that Cleveland team and has been a New York icon for a few short months. Sabathia has, for the third year running, inspired the support of fans in a different city.
Baseball players, at the end of the day, are making money and most likely playing for teams they did not personally follow themselves prior to their careers. They are flawed, human professionals (a player for a playoff-contending team recently made headlines for appearing with bruises on his face incurred during a booze-fueled incident with his wife), not the champions of dueling armies.
A plea for civility certainly wouldn’t have saved the Ephraimites. But we are not dealing with warfare here, or two cultures fighting for their survival. Taking a step back, it can be easy to forget that the fan wearing opposing colors takes a class with you or—gasp—even roots for the same team as you in a different sport. This playoff season, we must remember the ways we are not so different—not the sports-cap shibboleths that divide us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Monday, the women of “The View” gathered at their round table of rambling incoherence to discuss one Roman Polanski. (I use the term “discuss” loosely.) Whoopi Goldberg emerged from behind her rose-tinted sunglasses to make what she seemed to think was an important distinction: “I don’t believe it was rape-rape, and when we get all the information, someone will tell me in my ear.” No word yet on what’s been whispered to the star of “Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit” since, but perhaps I can offer something in the way of elucidating details. Roman Polanski lured a 13-year-old girl to a friend’s home under the guise of taking her picture, gave her champagne and part of a Quaalude pill, and proceeded to have oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse with her in spite of almost constant protest. Polanski lacked consent in a wide array of ways: The victim was underage, the victim was intoxicated, and the victim didn’t provide any.
But Whoopi Goldberg isn’t the only celebrity who has rushed to Polanski’s defense. Throngs of Hollywood types have expressed their support of the Oscar winner in the form of an online petition demanding that the director be released. (Polanski pled guilty to sex with a minor over three decades ago, then fled to France before receiving his sentence. He was recently arrested after traveling to Zurich, where a film festival was being held in his honor.) The absurdly long list of his supporters includes former crush of mine Gael García Bernal, former artist worthy of my respect Pedro Almodóvar, and former and current creepster Woody Allen. The petition dismissively referred to his crime as “une affaire de moeurs”: a matter of customs.
Before we get to the moral aspect of this affaire de moeurs, perhaps it’s worth it taking a little detour into legal history. As recently as 1982, in acquitting a 35-year-old Cambridge resident, Judge David Wild ruled, “If she [the victim] does not want it she only has to keep her legs shut and she would not get it without force and there would be marks of force being used...Women who say no, do not always mean no. It is not just a question of saying it, it is a question of how she says it, how she shows and makes it clear.”  When Polanski’s sister-in-law Debra Tate appeared on the “Today” show  last week, the crux of her argument echoed Wild’s. “There’s rape and then there’s rape,” she claimed. “It was determined that Roman did not forcibly have sex with this young woman.” While the legal definition of rape might today accommodate victims who verbally reject sexual acts, Wild’s words seem to ring true with a significant portion of the population. The rest of us find ourselves asking just how bruised and bloodied a woman has to be for society at large to perceive a crime as rape.
The traditionally feminist position refuses to make such differentiations on principle alone. When we discern among the various forms of sexual assault, the argument goes, we are making some kinds of rape more acceptable than others. But for victims of rape, such questions are all too familiar. Did I have too much to drink that night? Did I resist too little? In moments of tortured reflection, victims readily distinguish between actively forceful rape that occurs at gunpoint in dark alleyways and the dorm-room confusion of acquaintance rape. The answers to such questions are further obfuscated by a society in which “Cosmopolitan” recommends sex positions promising “a sense of vulnerability and confinement” (apparently “a huge turn-on”).  Or in which professional douchebag Tucker Max can, with a straight face, claim that he “got like 20 e-mails from women who were rape victims saying that, like, they supported me and loved my stuff, and they all had these stories, that were, like, heartbreaking, dude, because fucking rape sucks, dude, it’s not a joke.” (Touching, Tucker.)
The legal system alone cannot prevent rape. We must root out fundamental problems with a culture that explicitly and implicitly condones sexual assault. Obviously, the first step is to stop explicitly condoning sexual assault. (Here’s looking at you, Woody.) But a second, and equally important, step is to engage in categorizations that seem to be intuitive to so many. Rape is a complex crime riddled with subtleties, and while any sexual assault is despicable, immoral, and illegal, these experiences still lie on a spectrum. If we insist on lumping them together, our go-to picture of rape naturally becomes one of extremes. When we imagine rape, it’s “rape-rape,” not drunken refusal or subdued resistance. Embracing, rather than instinctively condemning, these distinctions can go a long way toward preventing rape and supporting those for whom such preventative efforts come too late.

To the editors:
We write to set the record straight about our department, which was grossly misrepresented in The Crimson (“Ex-Grad Student Alleges Misconduct,” Sept. 29). The e-mail on which the article was based paints a picture that bears no resemblance to the welcoming and open department and dedicated professors that we see on a daily basis.
In particular, we are deeply disappointed by the article’s portrayal of Professor Kenneth Rogoff. We find the slanderous accusations cited in the article completely at odds with the devoted teacher, mentor, and department member that all of us have come to know. It is unfortunate that Harvard’s policies and responsibility to protect its students’ privacy prevented it from discrediting the e-mail’s outrageous claims and led to such a one-sided and false picture of an upstanding member of the Harvard community. The Crimson’s readers deserve better.

To the editors:
Whenever there is a reigning majority, a struggling minority fights to makes its case heard. Such is the case with the current political status quo. In response to Nafees A. Syed’s article titled “Republican Shoe-Throwers” (op-ed, Sept. 24), I believe several misleading points were made concerning the image of Republican representation in this country.
Facing a bastion of liberal policy-making in Washington and coping with a lack of charismatic leadership, Republicans are licking their wounds and trying to regroup from last November. Meanwhile, factions of moderate Republicans try to distance themselves from the far-right adherents to Beck and Limbaugh. Where bipartisan collaboration is needed, there are those willing to put their country first and reach across the aisle. But when it comes to simply giving up to a majority without fighting for principle, Republicans keep on truckin’.
Syed’s article claims the Republican Party has resorted to attacks on personal character to deliver its message—something she also claims is not representative of the Democratic Party. Before the American public had time to forget the images propagated by Democrats of George W. Bush in a dunce hat, accusations of racism were being thrown at the GOP. True, racism has been associated within far-right sects of the Republican population, and it should not be tolerated. However, this is not representative of the Republican Party as a whole. Think, for example of the recent murder of abortion protestor James Pouillon of Michigan. Violence, as expected, draws emotional responses. Should the GOP start labeling liberal activists as nothing but estranged murderers? If Republicans should follow precedent from Democrats in terms of generating disrespect against the government, as Syed claims they should, then the results would not be as perfect as liberals want us to think. After 9/11, leftists began instigating claims that the Bush administration was behind the attacks to generate incentive for invading Iraq. Would this be the example of disrespect Syed is alluding we follow? Subversion and breaching the trust to the government that fights to ensure our security and freedom? The Democrats have as just a tainted record of disrespect as any other political institution in this country. Self-proclaimed righteousness has often proved to be a pivotal downfall in their party. Cases in point are Bill Clinton, Eliot Spitzer, and Rod Blagojevich.
So, then, why is “disrespect” so present? The answers are varied and many, but most can be derived from one factor: Republicans are feeling livid and hopeless.  Currently, The New York Times reports the federal government is responsible for 26 percent of national spending. Sixty percent of General Motors is now managed by the United States government, and only one out of every 10 mortgages in this country is not financed by the government. Simply put, Republicans are weary of the government’s exponential increase in business management and catering to private life. I affirm that individual greed and lack of government regulation, to an extent, brought us to this economic predicament. But how much longer and further will the government expand?  Republicans are reminiscent for the days of a bygone era, an era that supported the self-made man and competition. The idea of the economic frontier is no longer pulsating to the country’s rhythm. Now, Republicans fear America will grow accustomed to looking to the government for all of its solutions. Government management might help bail an economy out of a tight spot. But it does not foster individualism or incentive; it stagnates the spirit of the self-made image this country was founded on. That is why the Republican Party will keep on fighting.

Christine C. Ciotti, the Harvard School of Public Health’s head of human resources, has been named the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ new Associate Dean for Human Resources, effective Nov. 9, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced in an e-mail to staff yesterday.
In her new capacity, Ciotti will “seek to increase the focus on talent and performance management..., enhance employee communications, and advocate for diversity and inclusion” within FAS, Smith wrote.
Several HSPH staffers said yesterday that Ciotti—who took the helm of HSPH’s human resources division in 2007—regularly spoke with HSPH staffers and made them feel as though they were being listened to, underlining a collaborative spirit that may prove useful at a time when FAS staffers have said they feel out of touch with the administration.
“She really opened the door for interaction and exchange—for getting feedback from us,” said Laura Jay, the director of administration for HSPH’s Department of Society, Human Development, and Health. “The predecessor had a sort of closed-door policy, and Chris was much more active and open.... She was easy to approach, it was easy to talk about an issue with her.”
Ellen M. Gilmore, an HSPH assistant director of human resources, said that Ciotti is “all about collaboration” and “sits back and does a lot of listening at first” to try to make decisions that benefit the entire organization.
“If [staffers] are engaged, they’re going to do a better job,” Ciotti said. “One way to engage them is to connect with them and give them feedback.”
Ciotti spiked HSPH’s participation rate in Harvard’s annual performance survey from around 34 percent when she arrived to 94 percent in 2008 and 2009 both by dangling carrots like ice-cream or pizza parties and waving sticks—threatening not to hand out small performance bonuses until a department had achieved 100 percent participation.
Ciotti added that she hopes to improve “customer service” and “lay out an HR framework that supports FAS’ strategic priorities.” She said that she plans to talk to FAS staffers to try to find out “the things that are driving morale down.”
Ciotti—who will report to incoming FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan—met with Kirwan for Starbucks coffee last week and said that she looks forward to “working with her and learning from her.”
Smith has been searching for a new HR dean since this spring, when Ciotti’s predecessor Geoffrey M. Peters, along with 152 other FAS staffers, elected to take an early retirement incentive package offered by the University. Until a replacement could be found, Julie Stanley served as FAS’ interim HR chief since July, according to Smith’s announcement e-mail yesterday.

“Passionate” was the word friends, teammates, coaches, and Harvard officials used to describe Ariel E.F. Shaker ’10—who passed away Wednesday night after suffering injuries in a horse-riding accident last Thursday.
Her roommates said she loved talking, writing, literature, and spending time with people. Friends said that the passionate way she approached life—from her selflessness in her friendships to her love for Bob Dylan and the outdoors—left a mark on those around her.
“When I think of her, the word passion comes to mind,” said Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris of the 21-year-old Shaker. “She was creative, imaginative, and threw herself into everything she did.”
In an e-mail to students Monday afternoon, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds cited the words of Shaker’s college interviewer to describe her personality.
“She is easily the most personable applicant I’ve interviewed in my years of interviewing for Harvard,” the interviewer wrote. “She is well spoken, poised, engaging, sharp and witty. I’d be shocked if she isn’t a real leader among her peers.”
Above all, Shaker adored horses, which she had ridden since she was eight years old. It was her love for riding that led her to join the Harvard Polo Club this year.
Although Shaker had spent just a month as a member of the team, she made an immediate impression on her new coaches and teammates.
Coach Crocker Snow Jr. ’61 said that he and his wife Cissie, who coaches the women’s polo team, were instantly struck by Shaker’s athletic ability and love for horses—“all the requirements for becoming a polo player,” he said.
Women’s team captain Alexandra “Za” C. Tilt ’10 wrote in an e-mail that Shaker’s passion for horses was instantly clear and left a lasting impression on the members of the team.
“She had never played before, but I remember her second or third time practicing with us she pulled me aside and said, ‘I don’t just want to learn to play polo. I want to be GOOD at polo. Just tell me what I have to do,’ Tilt recalled in an e-mail. “She just seemed to love every minute of it.”
Snow said that while Shaker was with two other Harvard students at Pony Express in Ipswich, Mass. at the time of the accident—in which she thrown from a horse that then fell on her—she was not participating in a Harvard practice. He said that she was helping exercise some of the horses when she was injured.
“I can absolutely tell you that she was an extremely accomplished rider on a steady, dependable, reliable horse,” Crocker said. “It’s a mystery.”
The Salem News reported last week that police said Shaker was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.
A representative for the Ipswich Police Department did not respond to repeated requests for comment by The Crimson over the past few days.
After the accident, Shaker was taken by helicopter to Boston Medical Center with extensive internal bleeding in her head. A group of family and friends had been at her side throughout the weekend, according to Snow.
In what Harris called a “typically generous act,” Shaker donated her organs after her passing.
A native of Palo Alto, Calif., Shaker was a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator with a secondary field in English.
An avid rower in high school, Ariel had been a member of Harvard women’s Heavyweight Crew team before she joined the Polo team.
Shaker also served as a Resource Efficiency Program representative for Cabot House and worked in Cafe Gato Rojo and the Cabot Science Library.
Harris and his wife Cheryl invited students to gather in their home yesterday evening to commemorate Shaker. Harris said that a memorial service for Shaker is currently being planned for Friday.

CORRECTIONS
The original version of the Oct. 7 news article "Senior Ariel Shaker Passes Away" incorrectly stated in the headline and text of the article that Ariel E.F. Shaker '10 had passed away on Oct. 6, based on e-mails sent by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris, who both wrote that Shaker had died. In fact, College spokesman Jeff Neal later clarified that those e-mails were inaccurate, and that though Shaker would not make a meaningful recovery, she was being kept physically alive in order to allow her to be an organ donor. She was officially pronounced dead later Wednesday evening.
The article also gave the wrong name for a newspaper in Salem, Mass. that reported on the accident. It is the Salem News, not the Salem Times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Knocking on registered Cambridge voters’ doors while dressed neatly in a gray button-down shirt and black slacks, 31-year-old Leland Cheung looks every bit the earnest young politician.
But the Cambridge City Council aspirant is also a graduate student dual-enrolled at the Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management. And aside from the daily tasks of running his campaign—flyering, fundraising, and canvassing—he also has to attend classes.
On this particular day, he has squeezed an afternoon lecture at HKS in between meeting with his staff and calling potential donors. He began going door-to-door in the late afternoon and has now been at it for more than two hours.
A few blocks away from the MIT campus, Cheung rings the doorbell of local mother and Harvard lab technician Sara Amaral. As Amaral’s young son darts between her legs, she explains her biggest concern about local governance: the lack of decent parks and other resources for children. Cheung listens intently and occasionally adds thoughts of his own.
When their conversation ends, Amaral says she is impressed by Cheung’s attitude.
“If you’re doing it for the kids, you’ll get my vote,” she says.
And if Cheung does secure enough votes in November, he will be the youngest member of the Council, the first Asian-American elected, and the only student within the body in recent years.
He says his student identity is what motivates him to run, and he intends to mobilize student support to aid him on what may well be an uphill battle for a seat.
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
The child of immigrants, Cheung spent much of his childhood moving from state to state, never staying in any one place long enough to develop roots.
He says he initially hoped to leave his mark through scientific innovation, earning a B.S. in physics and a masters in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Stanford in 2000 and 2001, respectively. He was one of the first employees of Space Adventures, a Virginia-based firm that is the world’s only space tourism company to have actually sent private citizens into space.
But during this time, he met a woman in his community whose grandson had recently been killed by a driver speeding through a red light—and beyond her loss, she was despairing of the fact that the local legislature had voted down a proposal to install red-light cameras.
“That made me realize that who you elect on a local level really matters,” Cheung says.
In 2005, Cheung moved to Cambridge to work for a venture capital firm and became involved with a number of local philanthropic organizations, immersing himself in Cambridge life.
This summer, Cheung decided to run for City Council after reading about the incumbents and deciding that the students of Cambridge—who comprise one fourth of the total population—did not have a voice in local government.
“Individually, [the incumbents] are nice, intelligent people trying to do good, but they don’t represent you or me,” Cheung said. “They’re all over forty. None of them really relate to what students are going through.”
One of Cheung’s primary campaign issues is highlighting how all Cantabrigians could benefit from a liaison between the universities and the local residents—a role that Cheung says he is uniquely suited to fill.
He often cites a recent study, published on news Web site the Daily Beast, which ranked MIT and Harvard the fifth and 20th worst schools in the country, respectively, in terms of crime against students—a statistic that Cheung calls “shameful.”
“The mindset of the city toward the students shouldn’t be ‘They’re only here for four years,’ but rather ‘We only have four years to convince them to stay,’” he said.
CHEUNG’s CHALLENGES
Cheung says he is well aware that he is facing an uphill battle in his campaign. All nine incumbents and twelve outside challengers are running for a seat.
Cambridge uses a complex ranking system in its City Council election in which voters can list multiple preferences, and relative candidate rankings are taken into account in determining the nine members of the body.
“You only get one vote in a Cambridge election, and it needs to be the number one vote. That’s very hard to get,” says Glenn S. Koocher ’71, a 12-year veteran of the Cambridge School Committee.
Based on past voter turnout, Cheung estimates that he will need to receive about 1,500 first-place votes to claim a seat—amounting to only about 5 percent of the 30,000 combined MIT and Harvard students.
Cheung says he knows that the student vote can be notoriously difficult to mobilize, especially when most students would have to re-register as Cambridge voters.
“Issues like the public school system or Section 8 housing or community policing are very hot topics in the City Council race but don’t have that much relevance to the typical 19-year-old who is living in Adams and has a different set of interests,” says Matt S. DeBergalis, a 2000 MIT graduate who narrowly lost a Council seat in 2003.
In addition, Cheung says many city natives are loyal to the sitting Councilors.
But Koocher said these factors did not necessarily preclude the possibility of election.
“Anyone connected with the Universities’ student population, who ran a skillful campaign using the technological tools that we have now, could mobilize enough people to generate a sufficient turnout to get elected,” he says.
The campaign has been challenging on a personal level as well, Cheung says. He proposed to Yin Zhou, his girlfriend of three years, in August, but he will be busy with campaigning for much of the first three months of their engagement.
Zhou acknowledges the difficulty but says Cheung would “never be happy only doing one job.”
“He always wants to look outward to see how he can help other people,” she says.
A HAVEN FOR STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES
A number of Harvard undergraduates have begun encouraging fellow students to re-register as Cambridge voters by the October 14 deadline.
But Matthew Young ’12 says he has been disappointed so far by the response from the Harvard community.
“Harvard students don’t really seem to care about sending one of their own to Cambridge City Council,” says Young, who said he finds students to be very interested in direct public service—like volunteerism and philanthropy—but less inclined to engage in local politics.
Unlike Cambridge, which elects representatives to its nine City Council seats by citywide vote, New Haven votes for its thirty aldermen by district. As a result, Yale, which occupies a large portion of the city’s first ward, has historically been successful in putting an Eli on the board.
Two former Yale students who served as New Haven aldermen have donated to the Cheung campaign. One of them, Ben Healy, said that he was excited by Cheung’s campaign because he had seen firsthand the importance of bringing a student voice into city politics.
“If university students care about questions of public safety, if they care about development around the campus, if they care about the schools around them, having someone who could speak for that and who is accessible to a student population is just very powerful,” Healy says. “The best of the Yale aldermen have learned how to push the city and the university at the same time...I think that’s what Leland represents. That’s what his campaign is trying to emphasize.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Science held an open discussion to update the name of the Harvard Extension School at yesterday’s Faculty meeting in an effort to align the name with that of peer institutions and with the century-old program’s current mission.
The Committee on Continuing Education recommended renaming the Extension School to the “Harvard School of Continuing and Professional Studies,” and discussed the possibility of removing “Extension School” from the school’s degree names.
Professor of Computer Science Harry R. Lewis ’68, who represented the committee at the meeting, said that the name “would reflect modern uses and accurately portray that students study today at the Extension School in pursuit of professional training as well as a liberal arts education.”
Lewis said the name changes would serve to better identify between the professional and academic degrees offered by the school.
In addition to an associate degree, the Extension School currently offers a “Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies” and a “Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies.”
The committee recommended that the former be renamed “Bachelor of Liberal Arts” and the latter be split into a “Master of Liberal Arts” and a “Master of Professional Studies.”
At the meeting, English Professor Elaine Scarry voiced concerns that the degree titles might be too similar to degrees offered by the College and Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Science.
Those schools offer a “Bachelor of Arts” and a “Master of Arts,” respectively.
Lewis replied that he is aware of concerns that degrees without the labels could be used by graduates to pose as alumni of the College or GSAS.
“There’s always been the possibility, if someone is bent on deception,” he said after the meeting. “It’s never really caused us any reputational problems.”
Lewis chose to delay a vote until the next Faculty meeting at the end of the month.
Many professors were not surprised by these developments.
“I always thought there should be a change,” said Extension School Professor Robert C. Benfari, who has taught in the Masters in Management Program for 25 years. “It’s an evolving organism; it goes beyond just a pure extension school. It’s more for professional development.”
Due to the evolving nature of the program, many did not believe that the term “extension” properly reflected the school curriculum’s professional nature.
Harvard is one of the only schools that continues to use this term.
Ian Lamont, who graduated from the ALM program in 2008, said a change to the name would clarify the program’s position within the University.
“In my class, there were more graduating masters students than the Medical or Divinity schools,” he said. “Yet, we’re still considered an ‘extension’ of Harvard? That’s not right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first Faculty meeting of the year kicked off without a regular staple: cookies to complement professors’ tea and coffee.
“This is the first time in modern times with no cookies,” Faculty Council member Harry R. Lewis ’68 said as he held a white mug of tea. “We are sharing the pain with the undergraduates.”
“As part of our cost-cutting efforts, we’re doing our little part here in our Faculty meetings, saving about $500 per meeting for cookies and coffee,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith explained during the meeting.
But few professors were there to be disappointed as the meeting was more sparsely attended than usual, with several of the front rows almost entirely empty. But one absence in particular stood out: that of former University President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853.
His portrait, that is.
While Lewis presented the proposal to change the name of the Extension School he slipped in that Eliot’s portrait was no longer was perched above University President Drew G. Faust’s head as she spoke.
“[The Extension School] was created by President [Abbott Lawrence] Lowell, who looks down on these proceedings benignly from his customary perch in the corner of the room,” he said. “I think perhaps he looks a little less stern today, but I think that may not be because of the matter I bring before you—but for once he doesn’t have to stare at President Eliot across the room.”
“For some reason he has disappeared from his customary perch above the President’s head,” Lewis added, as Faust looked up and around in confusion and seemed to mouth to this year’s parliamentarian Thomas F. Kelly, “What?”
At the end of the Faculty meeting, after Lewis stood up to mention that the day marked the 100th anniversary of Lowell’s inauguration, Faust asked, “Which reminds me: Where is President Eliot? Where has he gone?”
“I can kind of answer that,” Smith replied. He explained that as of now, Eliot’s portrait is still in the art museum to be shielded away from a leak in the ceiling that has been in the process of being repaired.
“I like the principle of presidents being well taken care of,” Faust said.
Earlier in the meeting, the Faculty approved Kelly’s appointment as parliamentarian, a faculty member responsible for making sure that the monthly meetings are run according to standard rules. She informally welcomed Kelly to the position, saying, “Up here, Tom. I’ve been up here 15 minutes by myself, and that’s quite enough.”
Kelly—a Music professor who will now help conduct Faculty meetings as parliamentarian, as he did for former University President Lawrence H. Summers—gladly listened to choral music performed by the Harvard Radcliffe Collegium Musicum before the Faculty meeting. So though the meeting lacked cookies for the first time in recent memory, it also boasted recorded music, another recent first.
“I think there have been talks of having live groups here, but it was decided not to do that because people might feel like they had to sit down,” said Kelly, who noted that the music was Smith’s initiative. “Part of the point of having the music is that people should talk to each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second highest-ranking U.N. official in Afghanistan, Peter W. Galbraith ’73, son of the late Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith, was dismissed last Wednesday after he expressed disagreement to his superior about how best to address allegations of fraud in the country’s August presidential elections.
In results released in mid-September, incumbent Hamid Karzai won 54.6 percent of the vote, enough to win re-election. But extensive reports of fraud mean that the final results will depend upon investigations and recounts already underway.
Galbraith, an ex-U.S. diplomat, said that his former boss, Kai A. Eide, a past Norwegian diplomat and U.N. special representative, is not correctly addressing the issue of fraud.
“The approach [Eide] took at each critical stage in the process was to oppose doing anything about the fraud,” Galbraith said. “He is denying that fraud took place or is downplaying it.”
Galbraith went on to accuse Eide of serving in the interest of Karzai rather than that of the U.N.
“Eide has a case of clientitis. It’s a diplomat’s disease; you end up representing the head of state of a country to your organization rather than representing your organization to the country,” he said.
Galbraith was also critical of his dismissal, saying that he was fired “because he was concerned about fraud.”
“It’s pretty chilling that what I was recalled for was private dissent within an institution,” he added.
When asked about Galbraith’s dismissal, a U.N. spokesman, Farhan A. Haq, stated that the “bottom line for [the U.N.] is not to be distracted by this issue,” he said.
In a press release, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon reaffirmed his full support for Eide.
Haq said that the U.N. is currently attempting to give the Afghan people more control over the situation.
“Clearly fraud took place, and we’re making sure all the relevant data gets to Afghanistan’s Electoral Complaint’s Commission,” he said.
The U.N. now has the difficult task of finding a middle ground between two extremes, according to Tad J. Oelstrom, an Adjunct Lecturer and expert on the Middle East at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Oelstrom said that both extremes present their own challenges.
“If [the U.N.] throws out the whole election, Afghanistan’s going to go without an effective government for some period of time,” he said.
But according to Oelstrom, the other option, to endorse the election, could be just as hazardous.
“There’s a real risk that the [Afghan] people and much of the rest of the world will have a tough time embracing that government.”
Oelstrom seemed unconcerned about the controversy around Galbraith’s dismissal.
“My suspicion is that it will slowly go away and the U.N. will find someone else to take his place, pick up the pieces, and carry forward with the mission of sorting out the election.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Public Schools Committee discussed yesterday night the possibility of extending an innovative method for integrating special education students into the classroom from the Haggerty School to other schools in the district next year.
The meeting revolved around the presentation of Janelle T. Bradshaw—the principal of the Haggerty School—regarding the school’s practice of “co-teaching,” which is a method that seeks to integrate special needs students into regular classrooms.
Bradshaw said that since the advent of co-teaching at the school, there has been “an increased community feeling” among all the students.
Timothy K. Cutler, who has three children at the Haggerty School, including one with special needs, said that all his children have benefited from the new policy.
He described it as “a fabulous program” for his son with special needs, but also emphasized that the method is one of “mutual exchange” for all kinds of students.
The Haggerty School, which is K-6, piloted the method in the last school year in three classrooms, and has expanded it to five this year.
Bradshaw said that she had decided to attempt a less conventional model of integrating special education students into an environment dominated by general education students because she did not believe that their needs were being met.
In the previous system, special needs students were constantly removed from the room to meet with outside help and were therefore never properly integrated into the classroom environment, Bradshaw explained.
She noted that the continual movement of the special needs students in and out of the classroom caused the school to sometimes feel “like Grand Central Station” and that since the implementation of co-teaching “there have been a lot less doors slamming in the hallways.”
Given the positive response, committee members said after the meeting that they are considering expanding the program to other schools in the district for the next school year.
But they added that they still have concerns.
“I want to understand how we’re evaluating the program,” said school committee member Patricia M. Nolan ’80. “But it sounds like we heard some really promising things tonight.”
Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young added that he thinks that co-teaching is “an excellent structure to address certain goals.”
“As part of the budget process for 2010-2011, I expect it will be part of the initiatives we discuss,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who are up for expulsion from Harvard College or the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will no longer have their cases debated and voted on by the full Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The Faculty unanimously voted yesterday to give the 18-member Faculty Council the authority to expel a student by a two-thirds vote.
Previously, two-thirds of the Faculty present at a Faculty meeting had to vote to expel a student, while now 12 professors out of 18 would need to vote in favor of expulsion.
“There is something wrong with distributing to the whole Faculty who may or may not come to the meeting confidential and sometimes volatile materials,” said English Professor Elaine Scarry, a member of the Administrative Board Reform Committee, at the Faculty meeting.
History Professor Charles S. Maier ’60 said in an interview after the Faculty meeting that after an expulsion case a couple of years ago where the allegations themselves were contested, it became clear that it was too difficult to acquaint a large group of faculty members with the details of a particular case.
“There was no way for us to make an informed judgment,” Maier said. “Our only vote was for us to support the Ad Board’s recommendation or not to support the Ad Board.”
This change to the expulsion process was one of many reforms proposed by the reform committee, which began a review of current Ad Board policies in November 2007. The group presented its findings to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds in March.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said that when the Faculty Council met to discuss the proposal last week they decided to extend the change to cover GSAS students as well as College students.
When Rev. Peter J. Gomes inquired as to whether students could appeal their Faculty Council decisions to the entire Faculty, Botany Professor Donald H. Pfister, chair of the Ad Board review committee, said that the group had not included an appeal option in their proposal.
Maier asked whether they would propose for students to have a separate representative from the resident dean, so that the dean would not have to act as “both a prosecutor and a defense attorney.”
Current rules prevent anyone other than the resident dean from speaking on a student’s behalf during Ad Board proceedings.
Pfister said that as part of the proposal, the committee suggested that faculty members could be trained to serve as another representative for students in addition to their resident deans, though this suggestion has not yet been brought before the Faculty for a vote.
“I’m not sure what the students think of all of this,” Gomes said in an interview after the meeting. “I have no idea whether they think it is good or not, but I think it is better than it was.”
Scarry said that other parts of the committee’s proposals that require Faculty approval would be brought before the Faculty this semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So far this season, opponents of the Harvard men’s soccer team have been denied more times than freshman guys trying to enter final clubs. The Crimson defense, led by sophomore goalkeeper Austin Harms and senior defender Kwaku Nyamekye, has surrendered just three goals in Harvard’s first eight games.
The No. 8 Crimson (7-1, 1-0 Ivy) looks to continue its dominance at the back this afternoon when it hosts in-state rival Holy Cross (3-6, 1-1 Patriot) at 3:00 p.m.
“I think [our defense has] been the constant to our whole season,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “Anytime you’re [allowing] below a half goal a game, you’re doing well.”
This defensive success has come as a result, not only of skill, but also of teamwork.
“Our communication has kept a lot of dangerous plays to a minimum,” said Harms, who posted a .55 goals against average in his freshman season—good for 11th in the nation.
And through the Crimson’s first eight games of 2009, Harms has been even better. Harms is sporting a .38 goals against average with five shut outs. His clean sheet against Army on September 13th helped propel Harvard into the national rankings for the first time this season.
Despite its exceptional start to the season, the Crimson found itself in a tricky spot this past Saturday night. After dropping its first game of the season to then-No. 3 Wake Forest, Harvard had failed to score a goal in regulation in its Ivy League opener against Yale. The team was just minutes away from a tie which would have seen it enter the heart of conference play in a significant hole.
But freshman forward Brian Rogers gave the Crimson the win in the 103rd minute, breaking the 0-0 tie by placing the ball in the left corner of the net for his fifth goal of the season.
“He’s finding himself to be a consistent threat and also reliable in the clutch,” Clark said.
This afternoon, Harvard hopes to use its momentum from last Saturday’s win to defeat Holy Cross, before moving on to its second Ancient Eight contest this weekend at Cornell.
“I think that everyone is excited that we got back on the right track after [the loss to Wake Forest],” said Rogers, who earned his second Ivy League Rookie of the Week award for his performance on Saturday.
Unlike the Crimson, the Crusaders have not had a hot start to their season. After losing six of its first seven games, Holy Cross has made a quiet rebound, winning its past two games against Albany and Colgate.
“[Today’s game is] a chance to develop against really high quality players and coaches and hopefully we can carry that over into our Patriot League schedule,” Crusaders coach Ted Priestly said.
For Harvard, the keys to victory will be getting on the board quickly and sticking to its traditional style of play.
“If we can capitalize early it will certainly make the game a whole lot easier,” Clark said. “[Allowing your opponent to stay in the game] builds excitement and it builds hope.”
The Crusaders are led by reigning Patriot League Rookie of the Week Shane Regan, whose two goals last week put him atop his team in goals scored.
But Rogers feels that the Crimson’s aggressive style of defense should be able to stop this offensive production.
“We’re a pressuring team,” Rogers said. “As long as we do that and not try to a play a different style we should be pretty successful.”
With six Ivy League and three non-conference games remaining, Harvard still feels it has room to improve before the season ends. The Crimson hopes that by adding offensive production from a wider range of players it will become a more dangerous offensive team.
“Right now a heavy burden falls on a small number of guys for scoring and producing numbers,” said Clark, whose team gets 65% of its scoring from Rogers and co-captain Andre Akpan. “I think spreading that around a little bit will go a long way.”
“We have a really talented midfield but they haven’t been able to do much offensively,” Rogers said. “Once our midfield starts to click, which I think it will, then we’ll be even more dangerous.”
Despite this fact, Harvard hasn’t really had trouble finding the net. The Crimson is currently second in the Ivy League in goals per game, with an average of 2.12 scores per contest.
With this offensive production, Harvard hopes it can finish the season on top of the Ivy League and earn its fourth consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament.
“We certainly have the talent to win the rest of the games on our schedule,” Clark said.

Junior forward Katherine Sheeleigh got the team going, and Harvard never stopped in its 4-1 home win over Fairfield Tuesday. The Crimson attacked the goal early and often, out-shooting the Stags 26-7, as Harvard claimed its third consecutive win.
“We wanted to get in a really good rhythm right from the beginning,” senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann said.
The Crimson did exactly that, with Sheeleigh taking the first attempt on goal 32 seconds into the match.
Less than two minutes later, Sheeleigh tried again. After receiving a pass from junior midfielder Kerry Kartsonis, Sheeleigh fired the ball from the middle of the box. Fairfield goalie Kelly Boudreau dropped the ball before catching it again just after it crossed into the net.
“That was fortunate,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “But I do think that if you score early, it softens you up a little bit. You’ve got to keep going.”
Fairfield came back into the game thanks to a strong defense that held off three corner kicks in a row. Then, when Stag sophomore Jasmin Corniel headed the ball into the goal off of a corner kick from teammate Nicole Cavallaro to tie the game up, it looked as if the tide had changed.
“We had to fire up the engine again,” Leone said.
Fairfield’s Boudreau could only hold off the Crimson attack for so long, as Harvard notched its second tally just before the end of the first half. Patricia Yau had time in front of goal before passing it back to Sheeleigh, who drilled it in for her fourth goal of the season.
With a one-goal lead, the Crimson refused to look back. In the second half, Harvard dominated the game even more than it had in the first half, out-shooting Fairfield 15-3.
Harvard’s non-stop effort became obvious to the 100 fans in attendance even before junior co-captain Gina Wideroff fired the ball into the top right corner from 25 yards out to put the Crimson up 3-1.
With its largest lead of the season, Leone decided to give playing time to the rest of the Harvard squad
“It was great to get a lot of people in,” he said.
The Crimson squad was already depleted, as Leone made the move to rest co-captain Lizzy Nichols—a finalist for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award.
“We’re just resting her,” Leone said. “We’re so proud of her. She’s an amazing captain; she’s really the total package.”
Considering how well Harvard played without Nichols, it was not surprising that the Crimson continued to dominate possession after its substitutes took the field. Fairfield remained unable to generate offense as it watched Harvard’s Patricia Yau score a goal in the 84th minute after taking a pass from freshman Alexandra Conigliaro. Yau had an open net after Conigliaro recovered the ball when a Fairfield defender dove too soon.
“I was excited today because more people were getting into the attack,” Leone said. “Before, only the people who had the ball were doing good things and the rest of the team wasn’t. But today we were getting it done.”
While it’s always nice to chalk up another win, what matters most for the Crimson is what happens during Ivy League competition. Leone’s decisions to sit Nichols for the game and remove Mann in the final minutes of the second half highlighted the fact that Harvard’s attention is clearly turned towards the Cornell match this Saturday.
“We’re letting [them] rest on a Tuesday game because the focus has got to be on the Ivy League,” Leone said.
With its poor non-conference record, the Crimson will need to win the Ivy League to make the NCAA Tournament.
But for Harvard, yesterday’s outing was a welcome reminder of their potential.
“We did play really well today,” Leone said.

The Harvard field hockey team had its hands full last night at Jordan Field, as it faced off against the No. 10 Massachusetts Minutewomen (9-3). Though the Crimson (4-5, 1-2 Ivy) played well and freshman goaltender Cynthia Tassopoulos dazzled, UMass snuck away with a 1-0 victory.
“It was a great hockey game,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “We played very hard for 70 minutes, and did some really great things out there. [It was] a tremendous effort—just a complete game physically and mentally.”
The Crimson may have lost the contest, but according to the team and coach, the effort was not a disappointing one. Harvard showed defensive solidarity against a stronger opponent.
Still, it was evident in the first half which team was controlling the game. The Minutewomen had the majority of the possession and earned several penalty corners.
Despite coming close on numerous shots, Massachusetts could not get the ball past Tassopoulos, who made some swift pad and stick saves between the pipes.
“[Tassopoulos] was awesome,” co-captain Kristin Bannon said. “She did a great job today organizing the defense. She made some really clutch saves and really communicated to her defense.”
The freshman began the game ranked 14th in the nation with 7.13 saves per game. Her 12 stops last night will move her even further up the rankings.
“[Tassopoulos] made some great saves and even made them look easy,” Caples said. “She really had good control and command of the circle.”
Toward the end of the first half, the Minutewomen continued to show poise, and Makaela Potts created some dangerous attacking chances. With 10 minutes remaining in the period, Potts possessed the ball in midfield, beat a Crimson defender, and raced toward goal. She then dished to forward Katie Kelly, whose flick of the ball went just over the net.
Kelly had another opportunity with seven minutes left in the half. Outside the Harvard circle, she accelerated past one defender and powered through another, drawing a penalty corner.
On that corner, Tassopoulos made a quick pad save, but the rebound fell right to a Minutewoman. A Crimson defender blocked the ensuing shot with her foot, resulting in a penalty stroke. Potts converted the penalty shot to put UMass up 1-0.
The score would remain 1-0 for the remainder of the game as the Minutewomen failed to convert on additional opportunities and penalty corners.
“I think we did a really great job defending the penalty corner,” Caples said. “I don’t think we gave them too many second chance opportunities. They scored on a penalty stroke so you know we didn’t give up any field goals which is great.”
Harvard was unable to tally an equalizer and did not show too much offensively in the first half. But the opportunities picked up somewhat after the break.
“We did better in the second half, outletting and working the ball up through our midfield,” Caples said. “We didn’t have a lot inside our attack one-third. We need to work at a more sustained attack and creating more high percentage goal scoring opportunities.”
Crimson junior Chloe Keating, who leads the team with 21 points (eight goals and five assists) was held in check yesterday. UMass ended up outshooting Harvard 21-8.
“I think UMass is a very respectable team,” Bannon said. “I think everyone came to play today and we had a great defensive game.”
Harvard will return to the field this Saturday when it hosts Michigan.

It looks like the College Events Board won’t be taking Mather House to its upcoming Dinner and a Movie Night on Thurs., October 22.
But the CEB decided to encourage the College community to see the same movie six days later. For free. (Mather was planning to charge all along.)
Mather HoCo approached the CEB to reconsider the movie choice. But after a campus-wide poll, students overwhelmingly voted for The Wild Things. The movie. Not the Matherites. More on the mutiny after the jump.
Mather wasn’t going to let the CEB have the last word, though. In response, Mather threatened to withhold House funding for the CEB’s Harvard-Yale pep rally. In years past, the CEB has sought the consent of the 12 upperclassmen Houses to use funds allotted for one night’s brain break for the pep rally. The other 11 Houses, by the way, gave the CEB the go-ahead.
The belligerent back-and-forth that has taken place over the last few days has been for naught.
The College Fun Czar has tamed the Mather beast—she told the CEB that it was ultimately up to the Dean and Harvard University Dining Services to reappropriate those brain break funds for the Harvard-Yale pep rally.
Maybe not the appropriate title, according to one avid (maybe rabid?) Matherite.

When Tom Cruise starred in the film adaptation of the legal thriller The Firm, the book's author John Grisham later tipped his hat to Cruise, who played a recent Harvard Law School grad: "I thought [Cruise] did a good job," Grisham said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. "He played the innocent young associate very well."
Very well, indeed. And let's not forget the time when Cruise played an HLS alum/JAG corps member in A Few Good Men. But it seems as though the actor's ability to blend into the role of an attorney has disintegrated over the years, considering how much attention he drew yesterday when he snuck into an entertainment law class over at the Law School. Lawyer Bertram Fields '52, who has represented countless celebrities, paid a visit to the class to discuss his Hollywood travails—but in just 30 minutes, Fields was overshadowed by the arrival of his client.
According to The Harvard Law Record, Cruise "surreptitiously" entered the classroom and "flashed his megawatt smile" at titillated students, announcing that "he was there to see Bert speak; after all, he'd never had a chance to hear him lecture before." What a considerate client! More after the jump.
Cruise snuggled into the back row of the classroom and "assumed an attentive posture." Students, the creepily omniscient HLR reports, threw Cruise a few smiles but immediately resumed their "normal classroom activities": note-taking, hand-raising, "GChat"-ing, and—very weird, Harvard Law Review Record—browsing Net-a-Porter and Bergdorf Goodman. And then, "From time to time they would steal a sidelong look at the glowing actor." (Okay, so who thinks the author of this article was actually in the classroom when this all happened and was simultaneously shopping for a new Donna Karan shift? We do.)
Anyway, Cruise didn't make too much of an effort to disappear into the general crowd, and he parried questions from Fields, spoke about his experiences with tabloids, and made sure that even in the classroom, all the facts were straight.
Cruise—who prolifically offered "advice, stories, high fives, handshakes, hugs, and even at one point an impromptu dance"—stayed after class to speak with students, including a hoard of people that had gathered by the room as soon as virtual messaging systems went haywire within the classroom when Cruise first appeared.
The man might not make a good lawyer, but he sure does know how to win a crowd. And that's called fine acting, my friends.

Dudley House's Stacy Rush has always dreamed of playing Quidditch.
"I’m pretty sure I came to Harvard to play Quidditch. I've heard all about the teams in America. I hear it is the fastest-growing college sport in America. But I was disappointed that Harvard did not have a team. So I had to make one."
Now, Rush—a visiting undergraduate from Toronto—and her Co-Captain Alana Biden '11 are actually starting a team at Harvard—years after students at Middlebury College pioneered the real-life adaptation of author J.K. Rowling's fictional sport from the Harry Potter series.
Hoping to score at least a few physics concentrators at their intro meeting this Thursday at 8:30 p.m. in the Rabe Room Rabb Hall at Harvard Hillel, Rush and Biden seek to tackle what even Georgi's next pset won't prepare you for: the reason why your broomstick, no matter which model Firebolt you own, still won't fly. With this small impasse, for the time being, College Quidditch remains grounded: official rules state that you must have physical grasp of your broomstick at all times. This means one hand, two hands, or that awkward feeling of clenching a broomstick between your legs. Go ahead and try it. More after the jump.
How else do you adapt a wizard sport for the Muggle world? Take the Snitch, who is actually "a guy running around all dressed in yellow." Tackle him, catch him, beat the sh*t out of him, and it is 150 points for your team and the end of the game!
So next time you are headed to the MAC and see a bunch of kids running around on broomsticks, never fear—it isn't some Dorm Crew hazing ritual, but just your friendly Harvard Harry Potter Quidditch team out for practice.
Perhaps its not totally surprising. Harvard has already had a long history of being confused with Rowling's fictional Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And the Folklore and Mythology concentration probably only has that one thing going for them. At Harvard, we have our own algorithmic sorting hat known as Housing Day. And when you think about it, who hasn't told their friends back home that their dining hall looks like the "Great Hall"? Back in 2008, Harvard Square was temporarily renamed "Hogwarts Square," when Rowling was invited as Class Day speaker. And as FlyBy understands it, far more college essays are actually about Harry Potter than Dostoyevsky or Proust.
So could Quidditch be what Harvard-Yale is to the Ivy League Muggles? Doubtful. Before you Rush off with your butterbeer helmet and Gryffindor body paint, keep in mind that it is going to take a lot more than Felix Felicis to get this team off the ground. Still interested in joining? Well, at the very least, come Halloween time, you'll have a cool costume...errr, well at least you'll have a costume?

Harvard affiliates who set their @college.harvard.edu accounts to forward to Gmail (as any sane and organized person would), ran into unexpected trouble over the weekend. Students noticed that some of their e-mails were not being forwarded properly to their Gmail accounts. And in a surprising twist, Google—not FAS IT—was to blame.
But now the news has gotten worse.
FAS IT announced in a release Tuesday that a Google spam prevention effort not only delayed e-mail forwarding, but that for an unspecified amount of time on Saturday, Google actually "discarded some incoming messages."
Yikes. This poses a problem for students who had set their @college e-mail account to delete messages once they are forwarded to Gmail. FAS IT suggests that students set their Harvard e-mail addresses to keep a copy of any email you forward.
Full text of the announcement, after the jump.

On Thursday, October 1, FAS IT learned that Google (Gmail) had started to block email messages sent from @College.  This affected students who forwarded their email from @College to Gmail, or who sent outgoing email from @College to other Gmail recipients.
The issue appears to have been triggered as a protective measure against spam, which commonly involves large volumes of email from a single source.
Gmail is once again accepting all messages from @College.  However, Google has informed us that - for a period of time on Saturday, October 3 - it discarded some incoming messages.   In other cases, messages were queued for later delivery.  Unfortunately FAS IT has not received additional details about which messages were lost by Google. If you were trying to send or receive messages between Gmail and @College on Saturday, please contact the individuals in question to verify that your mail went through, or to resend if necessary.
Since not all external email providers guarantee their service or provide readily available support, we recommend that if you forward your mail from @College, you should configure your account to save a local copy of your messages.  To do so, click on "Options," followed by "Mail Settings," and finally "Mail Forwarding."
If you have questions or require computer assistance, please contact FAS IT at 617-495-9000 or help@fas.harvard.edu.

Today, you get a chance to check out the Eliot, Kirkland, and Winthrop House gyms in the second in our four part series. These "gyms," generally limited to House residents, range from dingy dungeons with a few exercise machines, to dingy dilapidated rooms with a television set and a few more exercise machines. But yeah, maybe they're not that bad. Some are definitely better than others. And if your gym sucks, there is always the MAC or the QRAC. Most gyms are card swipe access for their house only, but hey, you can always make friends and borrow a resident's ID.
As before each gym will receive between one and five stars.
Eliot House Gym (***)
This particularly spacious gym with a musty smell sits under D entryway. While most House gyms are pretty cramped, Eliot managed to avoid that issue. In part, this is because Eliot only has two treadmills, two elliptical machines/cross-trainers, one stair machine, and one bike. (There are also ergs in a nearby room.) In all, there's less cardio equipment here than in Winthrop and Kirkland.
Eliot, as most Houses, has basic weightlifting equipment. It also has a few perks, like a CD/Tape player, a punching bag, and a good supply of exercise mats. They also have amusing posters on the wall of House Master Lino Pertile: "Lino is not as strong as you, put your weights back." Classy.
Kirkland and Winthrop, after the jump.
Kirkland House Gym (***)
Anyone with swipe access can get into the Kirkland House gym, under E Entry. The gym sits in a larger room. As you exercise you can listen to the sound of an adjacent ping pong game. This seems to take away from the gym atmosphere but also means the space is more open and thus less crowded feeling.
Kirkland has three elliptical machines/cross-trainers, two bikes, two ergs, two stair machine, and one treadmill. It also has a punching bag, a fan, and a television. It even has chalk for lifting weights.

Winthrop House Gym (****)
This is unequivocally the best of the three. Under J Entry, you can find four ergs, some exercise equipment, and a punching bag sitting next to a laundry room. But that's not all. Swipe your Winthrop ID and you can get into another room which holds the bulk of the gym's equipment. There are three treadmills, one bike, one elliptical/cross-trainer, and one stair machine.
While this second room is definitely a bit cramped, it is well stocked. It holds a wide range of weights, has a television set, and a large fan. Overall Winthrop offers a complete workout in a clean looking space. While the separation in Adams House into two equally unattractive rooms was a downside, in Winthrop this setup allows the House to provide a variety of equipment without piling things on top of each other.
