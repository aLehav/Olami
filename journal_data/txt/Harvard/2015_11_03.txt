After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Arts are not leisure. Arts are fundamental to who we are as human beings,” director Julie Taymor said at an Oct. 30 event presented by the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership. In a conversation with Deborah Borda, president of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Hauser Leader-in-Residence at the Kennedy School, Taymor spoke about her own work in theater and film, the political power of the arts, and the challenges facing women in arts leadership.
“Julie defines, for me, the complete artist creator, somebody whose work spans such a stunning spectrum,” Borda said in her introduction. Taymor is best known for large-scale Broadway productions like “The Lion King” and “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,” but she is also renowned for her opera direction and her off-Broadway and film adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays. Her work is distinguished by the use of elaborate puppets and striking set design.
Dozens of students and fans filled the Charles Hotel’s Kennedy Room to see Taymor. “‘The Lion King’ was one of the first professional shows I saw when I was really young, and I’ve seen it a couple times since then. It’s one of those shows that really drew me to theater,” Matthew H. Munroe ’17 says. “I had never seen anything like it before, and I haven’t seen anything like it since. It completely changed what I think is possible in theater.”
While speaking on the importance of arts in civil society, Taymor drew on her experiences studying puppetry in Indonesia to discuss what Borda termed “the marginalization of the arts,” especially relating to cutting arts budgets in public schools. She contrasted America’s increasing tendency to consider the arts secondary to the sciences with the role of the arts in Indonesian communities. “There’s no word for ‘artist’ in Bali,” she said. “It’s what you do, whether you’re a tailor, or a teacher, or a farmer…. It is part of life.”
Taymor also discussed the processes behind some of her best-known works, including her 2010 movie adaptation of “The Tempest,” her Beatles-inspired film “Across the Universe,” and “The Lion King,” which she adapted from Disney’s animated feature into an epic musical famed for its intricate puppetry. She described how she transformed not only the aesthetic of “The Lion King” story but also elements of its plot. “It really is a short animated film, maybe 70 minutes. And it was a prodigal son story, but the prodigal son story did not really develop,” she said. “For this Simba child to earn his kingship back, he needed to go into a much darker journey.”
When asked by Borda about the risks involved in adapting the film for the stage, Taymor recalled the different expectations for Broadway musicals in 1997, when the musical debuted. “The game-changer was the kind of theater it was,” she said. “No one had ever seen puppetry and mask work used in this very sophisticated manner.” She also attested to the challenges of bringing this level of sophistication to a children’s story. “I very strongly do not like children’s theater, but there’s a difference between not liking children’s theater and believing that theater can be performed at any age…. It’s making mass theater into an elevator that could have 20 floors. You say to your audience, ‘We can go to the top, but we can get off at any floor.’”
Following an hour of discussion with Borda, Taymor fielded questions on topics ranging from managing conflicting artistic visions to the role of the arts in revolutionary change. She reflected on her career as a woman in a leadership position, where her assertiveness was often received more negatively than that of her male counterparts. “For women, there is no ‘enfant terrible.’ There’s just ‘bitch,’” she said, eliciting laughter from the audience.

When asked about his upcoming production of “Nine,” a Broadway musical written by Maury Yeston and inspired by Frederico Fellini’s semi-autobiographical film 8 1/2, director Joey R. Longstreet ’16 speaks with palpable enthusiasm. “We’re not promising to completely revolutionize the show, but we have thought a lot about bringing out the personalities of individual characters. I think [the show] has taken on a life of its own as a work,” he says. A constellation of characters—one man and 14 of the women in his life—and their interactions promise to stand at the fore of “Nine,” which runs Nov. 6-14 on the Loeb Mainstage.

The show revolves around the romantic exploits and creative aspirations of Guido, played by David A. Sheynberg ’16. During a period of extreme writer’s block, the dual challenges of love and art push him to the brink; Guido’s relationships with his wife and his mistresses fall apart as he descends into fantastical, self-absorbed artistic visions. While the skewed gender demographics of the cast reflect a traditional male-centric narrative, the producers hope to depart from a patriarchal reading of the show by highlighting the dimensionality of each member of the female chorus. Working toward this goal, they have focused a portion of rehearsals on formulating each character’s background beyond her relationship with Guido. “We want to convey the idea that all the women on stage are fully-formed, important, vital people—women with lives outside of some male,” Longstreet says.
The lone male member of the cast embraces its unusual makeup: “It’s very different from traditional all-male or male-heavy casts,” Sheynberg says. “But it’s refreshing and just delightful to be surrounded by so many amazing women.” Just as the female characters in the original play span a variety of ages and stations in life, Longstreet’s cast ranges from freshmen to seniors and encompasses a wide range of backgrounds.
A female-focused dynamic is not the only unique element “Nine” seeks to bring to the stage. “We’re including a kickline with 14 women—yes, it’s possible,” Longstreet says. In all aspects, “Nine” is simply massive: It includes 25 musicians, with 16 in the pit and 5 rehearsal pianists; 16 cast members; and 42 non-musical staff members. In order to accommodate the ensemble, which overflows the orchestra pit, several musicians—including a timpanist—are placed onstage behind large props.
Given that “Nine” is among the largest student productions this semester, rehearsals have proven a particular challenge, especially since the show features music and choreography in addition to acting. “There are so many different parts that it’s rare to practice with everybody together all at once,” Longstreet says. “It’s been a real challenge to get 16 people in the room rehearsing at the same time—it’s normally hard enough to do that with just 5 or 6.” Yet he feels the cast and crew have risen to the challenge posed by the production’s large scope. “We’ve all been working—not just me, but our production manager [Julia S. Schnall ’16], music director [Josh W. Bean ’16], the entire cast, and everyone else involved has dedicated hours and hours every day to the show.”
The cast of “Nine” hopes to leave an impression beyond its ambitious technical execution: They want audiences to feel the same emotional depth they see in the show. “We want audiences to come out of the show willing to look thoughtfully at the sorts of things that may be holding them down from living their own best life and come to peace with those limitations,” Sheynberg says. As a work of art that grapples with the creative process, “Nine” also holds special resonance for its cast.
Other cast members are equally invested in the artistic themes of “Nine.” Asia T. Stewart ’18, who plays Italian film star Claudia Nardi, sees the show as a commentary on the relationship between art and human connection. “In Claudia and Guido’s relationship, we see an on-screen romance disconnecting from a real-life relationship,” she says. “We see that line between reality and imagination getting blurred, and we see people getting lost in themselves and how dangerous that can be.” Stewart believes this emotional aspect will serve as a point of connection for many Harvard students. “You sometimes forget if you’re falling into a false image of yourself or if you’re actually genuinely constructing your own sense of identity,” she says. She and other members of “Nine” hope that the show reminds students to look both at and beyond themselves.
The cast agrees that the many aspects that make the show so difficult to master—dance choreography, musical scoring, singing, and acting—could potentially set “Nine” apart from other student productions recently to appear on the Loeb Mainstage. Although rehearsals so far have often been divided between the orchestra and the cast, members of “Nine” are excited to integrate the two. “[There’s a] false dichotomy of acting with and without music,” Sheynberg says. “Scenes are enriched by music. Sure, you keep certain things compartmentalized for practice, but it’s when you bring it all together that you feel the separate components of the show coalescing.”
Through the combination of these elements, this iteration of “Nine” seeks to challenge the traditional gender perspectives of the show while staying true to the story of one man’s romantic and creative pursuits. The cast hopes the end result will be humorous, inspiring, and surprisingly relatable. As Longstreet says, “We don’t all have 15 lovers or creative torment, but we hope the show inspires audiences to look outside of themselves creatively and interpersonally and recognize others as fully formed people.”

“Farce isn’t done often on this campus,” says Boyd I. R. Hampton ’16, director of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “Noises Off.” The cast of the play hopes to remedy that situation with their new production, which runs Nov. 6-15 in Farkas Hall. With quick dialogue and slapstick comedy, the play aims to offer a fresh, funny take on the more challenging sides of life.
Based on the concept that comedy is even funnier when seen from behind the scenes, “Noises Off” is a farce that focuses on the actors of another, fictitious farce, “Nothing’s On.” As the relationships among the characters get more strained and absurd, the actors’ performances soon devolve similarly and the lines between actors and their characters blur. “It’s definitely different in that, in the beginning of the play, they’re distinct—very much two characters. It’s a fun challenge to see how they fall apart as the play falls apart,” says Geoffrey G. Binney III ’17, who plays Garry Lejeune, a stuttering actor with an interest in Dotty Otley (Brooke E. Sweeney ’17).
In contrast to the elaborate structure of the play, its genre is fairly straightforward. It is a comedy—nothing more. Producer Avni Nahar ’17 hopes the laugh-out-loud humor of the show will appeal to theater fans and non-theater-goers alike. “I think it’s really just to entertain, at the very heart of it—to bring a lot of people together who have a really good time watching it,” she says.
The cast hopes to convey a deeper meaning that they believe will resonate with the student body. “All of these characters are juggling a lot, says James M. Graham ’17, who plays Lloyd Dallas. That’s where all of the humor comes from. So I think really being able to take a step back, look at that, and realise how—just how ridiculous it is, sometimes, and how all of these things overlapping causes you to be completely frantic, in a funny way, is a good way to look at it.”
From beginning to end, “Noises Off” seeks to offer a humorous escape for its audiences. “My main goal is just to make people laugh, because who doesn’t need more of that?” Hampton says. “I think Harvard students, along with everyone in the community, just need a laugh.”

Alona R. Bach ’16, a student in Cabot House, is a theatrical force on Harvard’s campus. Most recently, she acted in Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “The Importance of Being Earnest,” playing the part of Miss Prism for the second time in her life. Bach passionately pursued acting throughout her youth, developing a distinctly rich comprehension of drama. Last fall, HRDC premiered her script, “With Fates Driving,” at the Loeb Experimental Theater. This week, The Crimson sat down with Bach to discuss her focused and extensive passion for theater.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you realize that you might be interested in playwriting?
Alona R. Bach: When I was 12, I auditioned for a summer camp in New Jersey at Paper Mill Playhouse, and they called me in…for their main stage production, “Ragtime.” Through a connection from “Ragtime,” I was asked to work on a reading of a show called “Laughing Matter” while they were still developing the piece. I think that was the first time that I realized scripts could change. They were still being made, and it wasn’t just like there was this library of scripts that people pulled from…. For the first time, a script was something that was totally fluid and dynamic.
THC: When did you become more interested in playwriting and scripts?
AB: During my gap year before coming to college, I helped out at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. I sort of said, “I know you can’t pay me, but can you give me a temporary library card so I can check all the scripts out of your library?” And they did! There was a limit of five scripts, so I would just go on Tuesday, take home my five scripts, bring them back Thursday, take home five more, and just read so much.
THC: You’re a History of Science concentrator—an interesting contrast with theater. How do you think the two disciplines interact?
AB: History of Science is this kind of strange in-between field of bringing to life ideas, which I find fascinating. The stories and the histories of science are really fun. There’s definitely a danger to historians in putting them on stage, and to scientists as well. What a lot of people get angry about, especially with, for example, “The Imitation Game,” is that [such representations can] misrepresent science as one person as the hero, when it’s really this communal effort.
THC: Can you tell us a bit about the process of writing “With Fates Driving”?
AB: Senior year [of high school]…we were reading the “Aeneid” in Latin class. And [my Latin teacher] just had this fantastic way of…pointing out the very subtle things that Virgil was doing and bringing these characters from the dactylic hexameter…to life. And so we were translating the scene where Dido and Aeneas come head to head, and I thought, “Oh my gosh, this needs to be a play!” And so I went home, and I wrote a scene. Eventually, I tried to write a whole script…. I put it aside until spring of my freshman year here, when I was taking Advanced Playwriting with Liz Duffy Adams…[where] I was able to finish to a first draft of the script.
THC: What was it like seeing your work come to life onstage?
AB: I sat there the first night, and it was surreal. I knew the lines, but I had found all of these nuances. After one of the shows, we had a talkback with professors from the Classics department. And they situated it within the context of Augustan Rome, and they talked about Virgil, and really, intense, text-exegesis kind of things. And I was blown away…. I was so happy they were taking it so seriously and engaging with it on this level.
THC: Your theatrical pursuits must be quite demanding and time-consuming. What has been the hardest part about balancing that in your life?
AB: I’m a Modern Orthodox Jew, and there’s no way to balance that with theater…. You’re going to have to [work] with electricity, you’re probably going to write things down, [and] you’re going to get paid for working on a Saturday. Balancing that has been challenging. I take things as they come. I’m not a particularly spiritual person, but I love tradition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The study of literature is arguably as connected to certain specialties of medicine as is the study of, say, organic chemistry, though this statement may be controversial to some. Before bringing up the interpretive side of medicine and the importance of listening for the gaps or central features of a patient's story, I must admit that this vision goes against that of one of my literary idols, Anton Chekhov. A Russian physician and writer, Chekhov famously said, “Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my mistress.” From his perspective, medicine and literature were two separate entities.
Such a philosophy guides the academic experience of Harvard undergraduates who are interested in this intersection. They have the option of concentrating in fields such as English, Comparative Literature, Folklore and Mythology, or Classics while pursuing premedical coursework as electives, or of choosing a science concentration and taking literature classes on the side. I am an English concentrator and premedical student myself, and I am grateful for the opportunity to explore literature's connection to medicine while in college. This path is not as logistically difficult during one's undergraduate years as it may initially seem to be, and, perhaps surprisingly to some, it allows the student to develop literary skills that directly relate to medical practice.
The main requirement of this undergraduate path is balance. Jarrod R. Wetzel-Brown ’17 is an English concentrator who is finishing up his last two premedical requirements this year. "My academic path is a good balance for me. It really tests my mind in many ways that individual disciplines cannot truly do,” he says. I, too, have found that transitioning between humanities coursework and science assignments, between a response paper on the nuances of form in the novel “All the Pretty Horses” and a problem set on thermodynamics, allows me to notice broader connections between disciplines, such as the centrality of instability to both of these topics. A broad scope can be personally enriching and exciting. As Wetzell-Brown describes, “I get to taste what is real and what is romantic. I get to experience what is obvious and what is fantastic.”
Logistically, students also find balance. Tarina Quraishi ’14, a former editorial writer for the Crimson who graduated with a degree in English and is currently pursuing a career in medicine, describes the remarkable organizational ease that an English concentrator completing premed requirements experiences. “Having different formats of assignments makes this path a surprisingly good balance in terms of the workload,” she says. For instance, combining classes with weekly problem sets and no final exams with seminars which culminate in particularly long final papers provides one with the time to deeply investigate the literary texts as well as the scientific concepts. And such a schedule is not as difficult to plan as it may seem, particularly because Harvard departments are often especially helpful in terms of advising.
The Harvard English curriculum fosters skills that are applicable to clinical research and interpreting patients' narratives. As Quraishi explains, “The English department is dedicated to creative writing...as well as critique—writing essays, doing observational studies, interpreting descriptions and data.” She also describes how her English thesis was a particularly helpful experience in preparing her for the type of work she’s doing now. “I think that English research experience translates particularly well into medicine because you have a little bit more independence. You are producing your own work and your own ideas, and there's no protocol for that.” Students learn lessons about organizing and interpreting copious amounts of data and practice interpreting stories—which eventually they may hear from patients.
In this context, one can return to Chekhov's quote with a new perspective. After claiming that “Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my mistress,” Chekov then stated “Though it is irregular, it is less boring this way, and besides, neither of them loses anything through my infidelity.” Neither medicine nor literature need become neglected if one engages in both English and premedical courses—students who pursue this academic path actually have much to gain.

After seeing a 20 percent boost in attendance following the release of the first “Night at the Museum” movie in 2006, the American Museum of Natural History in New York began a sleepover program. Inspired by Ben Stiller’s raucous adventures with Easter Island Heads and Attila the Hun, children between the ages of eight and 12 flocked to the AMNH’s sleepovers, which sold out months in advance. It’s unlikely that many kids expected the museum’s objects to come to life, but their curiosities were surely piqued by the film’s central premise: What happens in the museum galleries after the doors are shut?
In its description of the sleepovers, the AMNH says it offers children and their parents the opportunity to “head out with flashlights in search of a variety of adventures.” On these nocturnal escapades, young museumgoers can “meet” their ancestral relatives in the Hall of Human Origins, “encounter” live animals, and “settle down” beneath a 94-foot blue whale. The use of such intimate verbs is noteworthy, as the museum recognizes the importance of the contextual rather than the substantive differences between daytime and nighttime visits. The same displays are open for viewing during regular hours, but the opportunity to get to know an object personally, uninhibited by mob-like crowds and the pressures of time, is unique. In short, experiencing museums in a different context elicits excitement.
Nighttime programs targeted at slightly older audiences have emerged in museums as well, but they often shift the attention from encountering museum collections under new conditions to hosting parties. “Third Thursdays” at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum boast late-night live music and a cash bar, while the Guggenheim in New York ropes off its galleries at the museum’s annual Young Collectors Party, allowing an “increasingly tipsy crowd” of “youthful, glamorous and moneyed New Yorkers” to take center stage, according to a New York Times article. But this is understandable. Fearing declining attendance, museums are continually looking for new attractions to entice young people. Often seen as the domain of weekend family outings, museums rarely wield the necessary sex appeal to claim one’s Friday night. Though New York’s AMNH does hold sleepovers for grown-ups, which offer the same “intimate adventure of discovery” that is afforded to children, lower commitment options exist for those willing to seek them out.
Museum consultant Marilyn Hood proposes six attributes that determine how adults choose to spend their leisure time: social interaction, feeling at ease in one’s surroundings, participating actively, having a challenge of new experiences, having an opportunity to learn, and doing something worthwhile. Traditional museums, she claims, only provide frequent visitors with the latter three. Bacchanals à la Guggenheim seemingly trade the opportunity to learn and to do something worthwhile for social interaction and active participation. However, some museums, like the Museum of Fine Arts and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, offer a middle ground by simply extending the gallery hours until and beyond 9pm on Thursdays and Fridays.
On a recent Thursday night excursion to the MFA’s current exhibition “Class Distinctions: Dutch Painting in the Age of Rembrandt and Vermeer,” I saw in abundance the three attributes of leisure that Hood does not associate with museums. In sharp contrast to the atmosphere of swarming hordes one would expect names like Rembrandt and Vermeer to draw, the MFA’s carpeted exhibition galleries maintained the sparsely populated atmosphere of an offbeat bookstore. With a ratio of about five people to 12 paintings, the central section of the show’s first gallery offered not only the freedom of choice, but also the freedom of time to ensure one’s comfort in one’s surroundings. Uninhibited by iPad selfies and unhurried by shuffling crowds, I could look slowly, developing an intimacy with private portraits of Dutch nobility that they deserve but likely rarely achieve.
Across the room, a group of 11 visitors buried their tour guide in questions next to a museum-going octet engaged in hushed yet intense discussion. Five sketchers, drawing pads in hand, faced a canvas by Gerard ter Borch sandwiched between Vermeer’s “The Astronomer” and “A Lady Writing.” Eagerly sharing his thoughts and illustrations, and certainly participating actively, one sketcher commented on the “almost haunting” atmosphere and pictorial unity of the Vermeers that he felt put ter Borch to shame.
Minutes later, a couple replaced the sketchers in front of “The Astronomer.” He in jeans and she in a white dress, they spent a long moment deeply looking, then privately conferred and walked away smiling, holding hands. Though certainly not the same collective experience as a museum atrium rave, the warm, quiet atmosphere of the MFA at night induced social interaction of a much more personal, meaningful nature.

The worst part about making clothes is the actual sewing. It is a tedious task, and frequently the seams do not come out perfectly. Sewing is a process of seam ripping and alterations. Tears are shed, fingers are pricked, and many hours are lost sweating over a hot sewing machine. But it is all worth it when the last seam is sewn and the garment is finished.

An early scene in “Experimenter” establishes just how much control Stanley Milgram (Peter Sarsgaard) exerts in his Yale lab—he even dictates the colors of his assistant’s lab coat. “I decided to make it gray. White was too medical.” The film’s Milgram is egotistical, controlling, and ever-so-slightly megalomaniacal—and yet he cuts a charming, sympathetic figure in Director Michael Almereyda’s new film.
Michael Amereyda’s “Experimenter” depicts the saga of Stanley Milgram and his brainchild, the eponymous Milgram Experiment, which sought to gauge the average person’s willingness to obey morally questionable orders from authority figures. The experiment’s subjects are asked by a researcher to deliver a series of increasingly painful shocks to an undercover actor posing as a fellow subject. Only a small minority of subjects actually stood up to the researcher and terminated their trial. The remainder of film traces Milgram’s life after his fall from public grace, detailing his new post as a professor at the City University of New York, his stabs at post-obedience experiments, his run-ins with the few remaining vestiges of his former fame, and, ultimately, his death—which Milgram narrates from beyond the fourth wall.
The film’s cast delivers all-around excellent performances. Winona Ryder’s portrayal of Milgram’s wife Sasha is nuanced and understated; she is able to show unflagging love and support without ever seeming sycophantic or two-dimensional. And Edoardo Ballerini’s Paul Handler,Milgram’s colleague and quasi-friend, is urbane and cultured, undeniably close to Milgram yet distant enough to underscore Milgram’s deep isolation. The ultimate success of a biopic often rests on the performance of the actor portraying the subject, and Sarsgaard does not disappoint. His performance is masterful, especially considering the film’s complex take on Milgram’s character. Sarsgaard manages to accentuate Milgram’s egotism while still making the character likable and sympathetic; he balances Milgram’s righteous fury with the moral grayness of the experiment itself, as well as with Milgram’s odd listlessness regarding his ultimate fate. Sarsgaard successfully portrays Milgram at his most imperious, as he is within the confines of his Yale laboratory, and at his most vulnerable and insecure—he is almost meek at the party at which he meets Sasha. He is witty, charming, yet somehow off—he seems to exist in a plane that is just adjacent to that inhabited by the other characters, and his isolation in spite of his brilliance gives the film a slightly tragic undertone that rounds out its natural playfulness.
And the film is indeed playful, both in content and in form; it features plenty of scenes that almost gleefully flout the conventions of the typical Oscar-bait biopic. In the tradition of great fourth-wall-breakers such as Rod Serling and Alfred Hitchcock, Almereyda has Milgram frequently break off to talk to his audience, delivering witty, charismatic monologues that still somehow manage to carry slightly menacing undertones. Some scenes border on the absurd: a number of Milgram’s hallway monologues taking place with a blurred elephant lumbering around in the background. Another scene, in which Milgram and Sasha visit one of Milgram’s old university mentors, depicts the characters having coffee against a grayscale, two-dimensional backdrop of a stately Victorian home. Director Almereyda never overemphasizes these scenes, but through their very understatedness they serve to emphasize the film’s peculiar timbre.
Even the film’s less flashy scenes show evidence of meticulous planning and execution. Milgram’s lab, for instance, has a very tightly controlled, almost monochromatic palette that mirrors his attention to detail in the lab. His post-Harvard suburban home is also very carefully wrought, all whites and browns, peppered with bright colors from his children’s toys. The film’s sets are carefully made, each of them achieving a deliberate balance between lushness and austerity.

UPDATED: November 25, 2015, at 11:29 p.m.
During its renovation, the Harvard Art Museums experienced a simultaneous physical and conceptual shift. In the past year, museum coordinators, directors, and students have implemented a variety of programming focused on spontaneous connection and interdisciplinary inspiration. From the student board’s new input on the institution, to the public tours curated by individual student guides, to the plethora of programming for scholars, curators, and conservators, the institution is booming. More than 4,000 visitors have utilized the lecture halls, the three study rooms, the two seminar rooms, and other new spaces in the first year of operation alone. The institution’s caretakers consider the museums to be, more than anything, one huge classroom.
Jessica Martinez, head of the Museums’ division of academic and public programs, emphasizes first and foremost that students are the priority in these immersive experiences. During events, the first few lecture hall rows are regularly reserved for students, as are a few seats in the regular 15-person seminars. But one of the largest challenges the program directors faced was raising awareness of the Museums’ events among the student body. Officially, the museums were closed between 2008 and 2014, with the exception of the the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, which remained open through 2013. An entire generation of Harvard students arrived and left during that period of time. “A lot of what we’re doing has been generated by students themselves,” says Erin Northington, the museum’s manager of student engagement programs.
Rob J. Hopkirk ’18, a current student board member, first connected with the Museums during his time on the 2014-2015 First Year Social Committee, which planned a freshman-only “After Hours at the Harvard Art Museums” event in April 2015. According to Hopkirk, that collaboration grew out of a conversation the group initiated with the museum staff about freshman programming. The directors were wholly enthusiastic, and the event was billed as an introduction to the artwork, one piece of which had never before been seen. The idea was to help freshmen realize the enormous changes that had been going on before their arrival on campus. “It’s mind-boggling how you can just step across the street from the Yard, enter the lobby, turn the corner, and you’re facing a Picasso,” Hopkirk says. “That immediacy of the space is important.”
The student guide program, in which 24 undergraduates from 14 different concentrations craft their own unique public tours, has been updated since the renovation. The program is unique in that the staff does not force the guides to follow set routes; student guides focus on the objects they find most engaging and build dialogue based on their own artistic interests. David Odo, the director of student programs and research curator for University Collections Initiatives, works closely with the guides. Before the renovation, a majority of the guides were History of Art and Architecture concentrators, but Odo finds the greater spread of disciplines creates a more dynamic conversation. “It’s not that we expect them to be pre-trained in art history,” Odo says. “What is most important is that they have a real passion for learning about our collections, and having really interesting conversations with fellow students, with member of the general public, whoever comes on our tours.”
The Harvard Art Museums’ student board arose in fall 2014 in response to a perceived lack of permanent connections with the undergraduate community. Led by Erin Northington, the 16 students work to maintain a vibrant link between the Museums’ programming and the student body. “I consider the board my mentors,” Northington says. “I think that we’re a team. I learn so much from them.” The board’s main tasks include meeting to provide input to museum operations, acting as representatives within their respective Houses and concentrations, and participating in on-campus events. Northington stresses that she wants students to be involved in whatever capacity they wish. “My hope is that students feel responsible for this place,” she says. “And they feel responsible in whatever way makes sense for who they are and what they’re doing here.”
In comparison with last year’s monthly meetings, the board now meets bimonthly to brainstorm student publicity, generate ideas for new programs, and set members up with events where they would like to volunteer. Northington has expanded publicity from the Museums’ still growing 1,000-member email list to other avenues based on the ideas and resources of the student board. For example, she recently disseminated specially made bookmarks to student board members to spread throughout their Houses. Additionally, “Corita Night,” held during community dinner on Oct. 15, linked the Museums with Harvard University Dining Services chefs to create meatball dishes inspired by Corita Kent’s screenprinted pop art. “A lot of museum education groups plan multiple years out,” Martinez says. “We do the same, but we want to be a bit more dynamic in what we offer so we can be relevant on this campus. So we want to respond to the conversations that are happening.”
Beyond showcasing exhibits, student board members serve as “satellite” representatives of the museum staff in the undergraduate Houses. Board members are aware of the full range of opportunities and events within the institution and thus can act as ambassadors. “It’s like having a staff member living residentially in the Houses,” Hopkirk says. “It’s a very big institution, and we don’t want it to become faceless. We can be the faces in the Houses.”
For the board members, the opportunity to work closely with the institution has granted them the chance to interact with the museum on a more intimate level. In November 2014, member Bobby T. Fitzpatrick ’16 witnessed German multimedia artist Rebecca Horn publically activate the installation “Flying Books under Black Rain Painting (2014).” “Without the Art Museums, I don’t know where else I would’ve seen that: a professional artist creating art. And every time I walk past it, I think: wow. I saw that happen.”
A sense of openness permeates the teaching spaces on the fourth and fifth floors of the Harvard Art Museums. Glass walls in the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies and the Art Study Center allow students and public patrons to see the activity of conservators and researchers. What is normally kept hidden and private is out in the open, as if the very art of conservation is now artwork. The museums’ programming as a whole embodies this approach. “We want our events to be a bit more organic,” Jessica Martinez says. “We’re trying to understand what the life of a student is here so that the museum spaces can be part of that regular schedule.”
In terms of curation, many of the current exhibitions within-gallery spaces stem from faculty conversations. The museum’s third floor currently features “Corita Kent and the Language of Pop,” an exhibit that originated in a Pop art course last semester with professor Jennifer L. Roberts. One initiative has linked a number of university departments through a three-part series titled "What's Light Got To Do With It?". Inspired by the UN designation of 2015 as the International Year of Light, the series will connect faculty members together with the public. Specifically for undergraduate courses, the University Teaching Gallery and University Study Gallery are designed to feature both semesterly and weekly rotations of pieces related to various courses in both the undergraduate and graduate curricula.
Francesca G. Bewer, research curator for conservation and technical studies, emphasized the importance of digital spaces in bringing these interdisciplinary programs to the academic and public communities. “The digital space is amazing, what it affords [these speakers] to do, to visualize, to see their amazing images on a large scale,” she says of the Lightbox Gallery on the fifth floor. One half of the Lightbox Gallery consists of a 12’ by 6.75’ wall installation of LCD HD screens. On the opposite wall, a double-layered fabric screen serves as a canvas for two high-resolution projectors. “That kind of display is pretty rare.” The Lightbox Gallery was heavily featured during the Cambridge Science Festival last spring, when 10 speakers presented their science projects using the space’s digital projection.
In a separate event, curators demonstrated to viewers how to restore a painting without physically altering it. The conversation put participants in dialog with curators who were studying how faded Mark Rothko paintings might be non-invasively restored through light projections. The seminar’s images are still available online on the 3D Digital Lightbox Gallery app, where a host of past projects are also linked.
For those who cannot come to the institution in person, or for those who seek a more kinesthetic approach, the Museums have also produced a medley of online resources. Their website features digital tours, including one called “Hotspots” that focuses in on individual objects. One Hotspot page hosts a video of the Bauhaus sculpture Light Prop for an Electric Stage in motion. On another page, visitors can use the digital tour of a Rothko print to see the extent of the “light” restoration curators worked on earlier in the year.
In addition to short-term programming and online projects, the Museums have pursued projects that promote student and curator collaboration over longer periods of time. Ethan Lasser, head of division of European and American Art, has been working on the “Exhibition of Progress,” which reassembles an interdisciplinary collection known as the “Philosophy Chamber” that was dispersed in 1822 to six different collections. In spring 2017, the Harvard Art Museums building will house those objects. Lasser’s job is to assemble the specialists and foster dialogue. “To have six voices from different specialties talk about one object is pretty exciting for me as an art historian,” he says. “It is also grounded in history in this case, because these conversations were happening a long time ago.” Lasser has brought together around 15 graduate and undergraduate work study students, research assistants, and catalog authors to work on the project, in addition to the semesterly interns he employs.
With regard to the rest of the building’s galleries, Lasser believes that the renovation process allowed for a well-reasoned shift in curation. In the years of “deadtime” when the museum building was undergoing its intense makeover, a similar restructuring was taking place within departments as the staff reorganized the gallery spaces. “We took people that, in some way, spoke different languages, and put them together for three weeks,” Lasser says. The galleries are now organized by chronology and theme rather than culture or media. “We tried to do it differently than other museums, which tend to be more culturally bound,” he says.
New spaces at the Museums allow students and public patrons to get a closer look at objects. Based on former study centers at the Fogg and Busch-Reisinger, the Art Study Center features slatted walls that house a rotating array the 90,000 objects unable to fit in the physical galleries. The full collection is constantly accessible by online reservation. Lasser stressed the value of spending a great deal of time with pieces in the Center. “Most curators don’t have that opportunity,” he says. “We gave the best real estate in the building to it, with the natural views. I think that shows how important we feel that is to the study of art—not just standing up in a gallery.”
Using this space, HAA 173g, a seminar led by professor Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, enables students to curate their own art exhibitions. “Drawings on Exhibition,” which will open in the spring on the second floor, will feature wall cards authored by the students themselves after spending a full semester investigating the pieces at close range in the Art Study Center. Michelle L. Kim ’18, one of the students in the class, marveled at the class’s unique intimacy. “We can get really, really close to [the pieces], we have magnifying glasses,” she says. “The professional there will lift the paper up to show us, I don’t know, a stain on the backside of the paper. Something that you can’t do when you’re casually walking through a museum.”
Laura Muir, research curator for Academic and Public Programs, emphasizes the events that occur within this space outside of course visits. Programs this semester focus on a variety of topics ranging from ancient coins and Islamic manuscripts to 19th century French drawings and prints. On Oct. 13, for example, Richard Tuttle, one of the most significant living postminimalist artists, gave a visiting talk at the GSD on his own works in the collection and American art at large. After the talk, Tuttle spoke further at a seminar in the Art Study Center where, alongside him, GSD students could examine a number of his works on display. Muir wants to continue this kind of programming in the spring. “It’s really drawing on curators and conservators and contemporary artists in informal conversations, but in that space with those objects,” she says. “We do really want to make students aware of those opportunities.”
Every four years, a new student body will interact with the Harvard Art Museums. This is both a blessing and a challenge. As for events for these new generations, Martinez indicates that she is interested in crafting more film and performance events to diversify programming. One such performance, initiated last year by Northington and two student directors, was the premiere of John Logan’s play “Red,” inspired by the life of Mark Rothko. In addition to exploring the potential of digital resources, Martinez also would like to expand the variety of event programming. She indicated that the open spaces of the Museums are clearly able to support larger performance pieces. As the institution builds its programming, the staff seeks to expand its offerings for future generations of students. “We typically feel like we’re doing things right when we partner with a student group or a faculty member. Or a research center,” Martinez says. “That kind of collaborative work is really at the core of our planning process.”

CORRECTION: November 25, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the museums that are now part of the Harvard Arts Museums were closed from 2008 to 2014. In fact, one of those museums, the Arthur M. Sackler, was open through 2013. An earlier version of this article also misquoted Erin Northington. In fact, Northington referred to the student baord as her“mentors,” not her “mentees.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A clown towers on stilts, abstract flames like tufts of fur lick buildings, and a gang of piranhas swarms a car. In Sheila Alvarado’s graphic novel adaptation of Daniel Alarcón’s “City of Clowns,” bizarre images accompany an equally surreal storyline. Alvarado’s artwork plays with perspective, shadows, and time, with oversized clowns stomping over the cityscape, eerie images depicted in shadows, and characters drifting outside and between panels.
“City of Clowns” was Alarcón’s debut work, first published as a short story in The New Yorker in 2003. Since then, he has received numerous awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2007. Although Alarcón, as he reveals in the book’s afterword, likes to look back on his previous work to draw inspiration, he has never previously returned to “City of Clowns.” Alarcón’s flashbacks and leaps in time and setting are slightly more confusing in a graphic novel, but Alvarado’s images bring the original gritty, lyrical prose to life in a haunting and imaginative way.
The graphic novel paints a dark portrait of a Lima, Peru fraught with corruption and violence while maintaining a twisted sort of humor and irony. Alvarado’s black and white pictures create a dramatic representation of the city where Alarcón was born. The book’s protagonist, Oscar, is a young journalist whose father has just died. From the beginning, Alarcón suggests an atmosphere of corruption with Oscar’s uncomfortable introduction to his father’s longtime mistress and now wife, Carmela, and her three sons. Meanwhile, Oscar is assigned by his newspaper to investigate the population of clowns in Lima. Throughout Oscar’s exploration into the world of clowns, he recounts flashbacks of his youth and his relationship with his father. Alarcón and Alvarado depict an immersive whirlpool of poverty and social instability in which Oscar’s dignity and morality are brought into question against the backdrop of general desperation and dreams of the good life.
Alvarado’s artwork seizes and exaggerates the unpolished and disorienting mood of Alarcón’s story. Her vertiginous cover illustrates a circle of towering buildings looming like the walls of a well viewed from within the well shaft. Often the texture of the pen marks and shading is visible, creating a fuzzy, sketchy effect and giving a sense of motion and hurriedness to the images. Every once in awhile there are pages in which the black and white colors have been reversed, like a starkly contrasted film negative. Often in those pages, a character’s face or an area of the scene will be highlighted in lighter colors, as if under a spotlight. The black background and white lines in these scenes add to the darkness of the plot and suggest shady activity. Midway through the story, the cover illustration dizzyingly reappears. It is supplemented with text written in a spiraling circle, in which Oscar realizes, “Lima was, in fact and in spirit, a city of clowns.” As the story itself jumps between flashbacks and the present, the disorienting quality of the setting and the plot is further embodied in the artwork.
Alarcón’s story provides a penetrating treatment of themes of morality and desperation that Alvarado’s thought-provoking depiction of Oscar complements. The connection between these two aspects of the book is made through a recurring motif of clowns and pathetic existences. Clowns in Lima are essentially street performers, scraping together a living by dressing in vibrant costumes and panhandling for change. Oscar too dons a disguise when he begins to attend a private school. His poor background isolates him from the wealthier students—both inspiring contempt from his peers and intimidating them, as they speculate on his involvement in criminal activities. Ironically, their negative vision of him becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as Oscar eventually does get involved in some of his father’s shadier occupations. As the story progresses, it becomes increasingly unclear whether Oscar is wearing a disguise or actually becoming the person his disguise portrays. Through these masks and disguises, Alarcón and Alvarado relatably convey the universal experience of how confusing it can be to seek and discover one’s identity as a young adult.
Though the visual representation of Oscar’s coming-of-age adds a lot to the original story, the main shortcoming of the graphic novel adaptation is that the leaps in time throughout the story become harder to follow. As the plot jumps between Oscar’s current investigation on clowns and flashbacks to his childhood, the chronological sequence of events is not always clear. The time jumps are easier to keep straight in the original short story. The confusing layout of the plot, and its abrupt end, add to the overall feeling of disorientation in the story, but it is unclear whether Alvarado intended this effect.
On the whole, the content of the graphic novel is faithful to Alarcón's original text—but a provocative addition in the graphic novel is a scene where Oscar recounts a relationship with a girl who wore stilts as part of a church youth group circus. The scene contributes an aspect of sexual balance in power to the story, which was less present in the original. This scene is the only time sex is explicitly mentioned in the entire story, and it is depicted in an intimidating, disturbing way. The girl towers looms darkly over Oscar: “gone was the timid and cautious girl,” and Oscar “buried [his] face in her crotch, and worshipped this majestic woman.”
The dark and disorienting mood of Oscar's childhood and his relationship with his parents is poignantly and viscerally embodied in Alvarado's illustrations. The graphic novel is a more developed version of the short story that further pushes the themes of disorientation, desperation, and corruption presented in the original text. Alvarado’s drawings, which bring vignettes of youthful confusion and social disorder in Lima to motional and emotional life, make the graphic novel an inventive and moving adaptation, full of surreal imagery and disturbing action.

The Bootleg Series has completely transformed the way that Bob Dylan's fans view the chameleonic artist’s staggering output. In the 20-odd years since the release of the first three volumes of the collection, Dylan has continued to put out paradigm-shifting outtakes and gorgeously restored live shows, primarily covering his iconic era from 1962 to 1975. From the 1966 Royal Albert Hall Concert (Vol. 4)—in which Dylan and his backing band shocked the world by going electric halfway through the set—to the recently released Basement Tapes Complete from Dylan’s legendary 1967 jam with The Band (Vol. 11), the Series has provided countless revelations about the artist’s songwriting development, recording process, and live idiosyncrasies.
Until now, the Bootleg Series has tragically offered only scattered visions of Dylan’s in-studio process during his pivotal move from folk to rock. This week, however, Dylan is releasing “every note recorded during the 1965-1966 studio sessions, every alternate take and alternate lyric.” NPR First Listen is presenting an 80-minute sliver of the result, a massive, 18-CD compendium of all the tape run in the creation of “Bringing it All Back Home,” “Highway 61 Revisited,” and “Blonde on Blonde.” While the sheer size of the release makes premature any survey statement on how the cuts will alter perspective on Dylan’s magical year—somehow already 50 years in the past—the first glimpses show just how engaged Dylan and his brilliant band were; every piano line, organ chord, and guttural yodel is remarkably ready for record. The collection, dubbed in full “The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965-1966,” provides further proof of Dylan’s revolutionary zeal and genius assemblage of talent.
One of the most exhilarating elements of the Bootleg Series is its ability to communicate across volumes. “She’s Your Lover Now,” one of Dylan’s greatest songs, did not even officially see the light of day until it surfaced on Vol. 1-3 in 1991. The burst of up-tempo paranoia, in which Dylan seemingly confronts both an ex-lover and her new beau, is punctuated by pounding piano and surreal glimpses of drunken mistakes that grow in aggressiveness until they fade out mid-phrase. The track, which officially was initially slated for the seminal “Blonde on Blonde,” offers a uniquely baroque pop sensibility in conjunction with a much more acidic eventual album.
Vol. 12 offers several alternate versions of “She’s Your Lover Now.” The seeming best of the bunch augments the bare piano chords of the original with Al Kooper’s trademark organ, which sounds much like it does on the official cuts of “Like a Rolling Stone” and several tracks on “Blonde on Blonde.” Dylan, who is often unclear in his lyric about who, exactly, he is eviscerating in his tirade, changes the lyrical denouement of the song from “You better talk to her ’bout it / You’re her lover now” to “You better talk to her about it / She’s your lover now.” With this switch, the tangled web of the song’s perspective further complicates.
Hundreds of little instrumental and lyrical clues are included throughout the anthology. Here, the hard drive of the familiar “Absolutely Sweet Marie” is replaced with light arpeggio, suggesting a softer tone to the song’s confusing distinction between loving lyric and acerbic instrumentation. At the start of the take, producer Bob Johnston asks Dylan, “What’s the name of this, Bob?” to which the crooner responds, plaintively, “Where Are You Tonight, Sweet Marie?” Even the title is delightfully softer than that of the famed final product.
While “Vol. 12” can be endlessly parsed and explored from an almost historiographical perspective, it also contains some simply beautiful, vulnerable listens of Dylan without artifice. The artist’s vocal on Take 1 of “She Belongs to Me,” for example, almost sounds as if he is crying; his voice wavers and wanders around his ode to his lover artist who “don’t look back.” On record, “Visions of Johanna” is Dylan’s slow drawl about his frustrated acceptance of Louise, who is “all right” but “just near,” and his pining after his apparent real love, the elusive Johanna. On “Vol. 12,” however, one version showcases a sped-up, angrier track that feels more like a gorgeous tell-off than a sad ballad.
It is hard to criticize a work that provides such a window into one of the most important years in any artist’s musical trajectory. Even if the collection was badly produced and musically messy, it would still be a priceless cultural document. The gracefulness of so many of the songs, however, suggests that much of what Dylan produced during 1965-1966 had something fundamental to say about popular music. “Vol. 12,” at least at first glance, just might exceed any reasonable expectation for Dylan’s glorious throwaways.

Three years after releasing the moody and majestic theme to the James Bond film “Skyfall,” Adele finally returned from a personal sabbatical with a definitive comeback single and power anthem. Aptly titled “Hello,” the song combines favorable elements from hit singles “Rolling in the Deep” and “Someone Like You” to create a grand, orchestral, and stirring sound.
Upon an initial listen, “Hello” has all the features of yet another classic Adele track: arresting lyrics despite their narrative simplicity, smooth production, and impressive vocal delivery. The song opens with Adele singing in her recognizable alto voice over a simple piano chord progression. There’s anticipation and wariness in the first “hello”; the brief silences that appear between lines mirror her inner hesitation and contemplation. As she laments a lost love, she moves fluidly through different notes and inflections.
Immaculate production—with accompanying drums and backing vocals—leaves room for Adele’s voice to cut through the instrumentation and allows the drama of the song to progress in a satisfying manner. The transition from the introduction to chorus offers the single’s only unexpected moment, as the instrumental production and vocals intensify in parallel with Adele’s despair.
The beauty of Adele’s artistry is that she lays out her emotional experiences both lyrically and musically with a stripped-down intensity unique in the pop music canon. Adele’s pining, fervor, and desperation is laid out on the table, deemed valid, and given careful attention by every part of her production. Despite the continued honesty, however, “Hello” is undeniably more of the same; an engaged, albeit safe, ballad. The success of her newest album “25”—set to release on Nov. 20—depends on her ability to mix reliance on her tried-and-true system of emotional intimacy while doing something, anything, new. Adele’s sophomore album “21” solidified her status as a successful pop star, and a return to greater experimentation across genres such as jazz and soul present in the debut album “19” could offer one way forward. While “Hello” doesn’t offer much evidence of a potential move back towards eclecticism, it also proves Adele still has the magic that has made her so ubiquitous. Given her exceptional range, vocal mastery, and record-shattering sales, she seems poised for more staggering success.

The death of Andre Smith, the 17-year-old football player who passed away last month, is a tragedy. Its impetus for the recent article (which calls for the shutting down of Harvard football) is understandable, if not commendable.
But if we’re going to dismantle the Harvard football program, then ice hockey, rugby, lacrosse, wrestling, and soccer have to go too. Women’s soccer is routinely the number two sport in terms of concussions incurred per player. Gymnastics, where concussions are infrequent but potentially devastating, might also have to go. Two of the worst concussions I’ve seen came from unsuspecting women’s volleyball players being hit in the head. Volleyball, out.
When we ask to cut football programs, we’re taking the first step in cutting athletics entirely, assuming their risk outweighs their net worth—logistically unlikely and, in my opinion, unnecessary.
Referring back to the original article, I cannot find the study which conclusively states that playing football leads to “brain damage, in the form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, post-concussion syndrome, depression, and other long-term head-related injuries.” The really scary stuff (CTE) occurs mostly in NFL players—that is, in less than 0.1 percent of the about 1.8 million football players (summing those in Pop Warner, high school, the NCAA, and the NFL) in the United States, which seems statistically negligible. Moreover, NFL players move further off the grid with the length of their season (last year the Patriots played 19 games, almost twice the length of Harvard’s 10-game season). And if twice as many games per season doesn’t further separate those from which most data is collected, consider that the average severity of impact is incalculably greater. Clearly, NFL players are in a league of their own.
There’s no long term study demonstrating the effects of a high school or college football career. There should be.
The article listed depression as a side-effect of football. The depression referred to is probably a symptom of frustration regarding decreasing cognitive performance, which can be exacerbated by the power of suggestion and accompanying stress. Depression is complicated, and not purely physical, so let’s take that one off the table.
I would ask those who are calling to shut down football to listen to millions of coaches and players who maintain positive relationships to the sport—not biased opinions, but stories from the front. Last season, after a close game, I heard my name called and a short man in suit and tie found my arm to pull me close. With tears in his eyes he thanked me for the opportunity I—and the game—had given his son (his son who, though he wore himself out all week in practice and cheered his heart out all evening, never passed the sideline—this was not the father of a star, only a participant). With humility, I listened to the story of a boy who was depressed, lonely, and socially awkward; I heard about how incredibly hard it is for a father to watch his son sit in his room all weekend, wishing he had even one friend to call. Our handshake turned into a quick hug after he expressed that football had brought them both out of a place too dark to mention.
I wonder if anyone would suggest dismantling athletics after spending time with the mother of another student who, at 14 years old, was one more suspension away from getting kicked out of school. It’s a powerful thing to hear her explain, tearfully grateful, how football and the mentors it provided had saved her son from himself. I should mention that this former athlete spent last summer interning at the White House and will graduate this spring from a top-tier college.
On homecoming you can stop by any number of Cambridge bars and listen to old friends telling stories about each other, about victories and losses, impersonating their coaches and feeling a warmth kindled by a bond which few can understand. This real world experience cannot be translated into the fantasy football interface. We’re not talking about an appreciation for the game, or even the deepest possible fandom. We’re talking about a non-traditional learning experience that is beyond definition, even (or perhaps especially) by those who have experienced it first hand.
I’m not claiming football is safe, or that concussions aren’t a real concern. It’s not; they are. What I’m saying is that we cannot defeat an issue if we keep swinging at its shadow.
We cannot get rid of football unless we’re prepared to cut most sports. And we cannot limit concussions until we make sports safer: We have to notice the warning signs faster, we have to prepare the body to brace, we have to coach an athlete to put herself in safe positions as often as possible, and we have to take rehabilitation seriously. We have to be better teachers and coaches.
The easy response is to say that sports have an issue, get rid of them—it’s harder to say that sports have an issue, so let’s fix them. There’s a way, if we stop scapegoating and gather the will. There’s good work still to be done.
Go Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Efforts are brewing to unionize the graduate students of Harvard. The administration has responded by warning that a union will disrupt the special relationship between graduate students and advisors and by instructing the faculty to tell students about unionizing’s “disadvantages”. Undergraduates, seeing that a unionized graduate student body promises better teaching, have spoken in support. Now we graduate students face a choice: unionize and draw the ire of the administration, or keep things as they are?
In the 2013-2014 academic year, I was the natural sciences representative on the Graduate Student Council, and a number of graduate student issues were coming to a head. In teaching, they included the fact that hours were often not adhered to or defined; that responsibilities were typically undefined; that there was no effective recourse for exploitation (especially when the course instructor was also the teaching fellow’s research advisor); that pay for teaching was often egregiously late; and that teaching appointments were highly uncertain, placing graduate students into financial precariousness.
In research, the problems were in some ways more insidious: Expectations, norms, and standards were not defined; norms of isolation, helplessness, and mendicancy were not uncommon; and there was again no effective recourse for exploitation, which at times led to mental and emotional harm. Indeed, in recent years, I have known graduate students (sometimes close to graduation) who have been fired by advisors over personal disagreements or over conflicts between advancing the student’s career or the advisor’s. These students are often left adrift to fend for themselves without formal recourse, with years of work (and youth) essentially wasted.
In the Graduate Student Council, we created a task force to address these problems. Our strategy was to bring them to the attention of the administration and work collaboratively to define norms and standards and to set up functional systems of recourse for exploitation and abuse.
Over the 2013-2014 academic year, our task force held a series of meetings with GSAS and SEAS administrators. We were surprised that administrators were unable to agree on how many hours corresponded to a teaching load. We were surprised that administrators, when told of cases of exploitation and abuse, said that it was the fault of students for not approaching administrators in person to resolve such issues, which indicated a profound ignorance of the power dynamic in place between graduate students and advisors. We were surprised that administrators regularly claimed powerlessness or cited faculty intransigence in order to argue that policies to protect students’ interests would be futile and thus were not worth pursuing.
Despite the good-faith efforts of some administrative staff, progress at the level of decision-makers by the end of the year was almost non-existent: Teaching fellow responsibilities were still not defined, nor were effective systems in place for feedback or recourse. Tangible progress was limited to SEAS: Administrators had agreed on how many hours constituted a teaching load.
What does this have to do with a graduate student union? This: Even when administrators are made aware of the problems facing graduate students, experience has shown that the administration simply does not have sufficient incentive to address these concerns promptly or meaningfully. The faculty is regularly used as a scapegoat to justify lack of policy. Ad hoc efforts by students or staff languish in bureaucratic limbo and then evaporate. Indeed, if administrative decision-makers had a strong interest in solving these problems, it stands to reason that they would have addressed them before now.
Thus, if we believe Harvard should be a place where these problems are not the norm, then we must understand, too, that experience tells us that we will need to apply consistent, organized pressure through a body that operates outside the auspices of the administration. This is what a union can provide.
Of course, graduate students have a range of experiences depending on department, advisor, and personal circumstance. The issue at hand is not that all graduate students face all these problems all the time. Rather, it is that some do at least some of the time, and there is no organized body to apply real pressure to the administration to address these problems and others.
Would a union improve the graduate student experience? Would it improve the educational experience for undergraduates? It’s reasonable to expect so. Of course, there are other good reasons to create a union. One is to educate students on models of governance beyond authoritarianism—an important piece of understanding for students to have as they enter the world.
Will the administration be upset if the graduate students decide to pursue a union? Maybe. A union would challenge the administration’s ability to set policies as it sees fit. But I think the administration will, in the end, be okay.
Now we graduate students have a decision to make. What sort of Harvard do we want?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there was anything to learn from the Republican presidential candidates debate last Wednesday—and there wasn’t much—it was that the warring campaigns had finally found a common enemy other than Hillary Clinton: the mainstream media.
When asked to comment on a Sun-Sentinel  editorial calling on him to resign after a notoriously shabby attendance record, Florida Senator Marco Rubio deflected to the attendance records of previous Democratic candidates and called it “evidence of the bias that exists in the America media today.” Never you mind that editorials are opinionated by definition.
“Bias” is reporting—which appears in the news and not the opinions section—that is altered and swayed based on the political preferences and agendas of writers and editors, the conscious bending of facts by way of omission and misrepresentation, even though it is branded as fair and balanced. “Bias” is not the printing of stories that make the press secretary unhappy. That’s just life.
“The Democrats have the ultimate super PAC, it’s called the mainstream media,” said Rubio later on.
“Super PACs” are nominally independent groups that can spend unlimited sums for and against candidates, and Rubio has had no problem accepting the help of one to the tune of $16 million. There is another $16 million to support him raised by a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization advised by the same man running his super PAC, which can raise unlimited sums but does not have to disclose their donors.
In contrast, newspapers are newspapers.
And though Rubio started the fire, his opponents were more than happy to pile on. Take this response from Texas Senator Ted Cruz after being asked a substantive question about his opposition to the debt limit deal:
“The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don’t trust the media,” he started, giving examples of unfair questions (“Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?” should also be off the table, apparently), before ending with an unironic call to the moderators to talk “about the substantive issues the people care about.”
With the Democratic debate, Cruz continued, “Every fawning question from the media was, ‘Which of you is more handsome and why?’” How anyone could describe the Bernie-bruising first debate in such a way confuses me, but then again so does a lot about this presidential primary.
“Substantive” questions revolve around policy, not personality or internecine politicking. Looking over the much-derided list of purportedly “biased” CNBC questions, I would consider 45 of the 46 to be substantive—the lone exception being the question asking Carly Fiorina to defend an unrelated quote from Tom Perkins.
Contra Cruz’s declaration of the debate being a “cage match” where the moderators ask candidates to “insult people over here,” nothing of the sort occurred in this debate. Yet the very first Republican debate, in which the Fox News moderator’s first question to Rubio was to “address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you…are better prepared to be president than he is,” attracted no similar complaints of mainstream media bias.
Just 32 percent of Republicans say they trust the mass media compared with 55 percent of Democrats—and candidates are quick to seize on these assured applause lines when confronted with uncomfortable and tough lines of questioning.
Consider the timing of each Republican’s invocation of the mainstream media straw man: Rubio after being asked about his subpar voting attendance record, Cruz after being asked about his desperado debt ceiling antics, Ben Carson after being asked about his questionable and extensive relationship with a nutritional supplements company.
All substantive questions in their own right—all going unanswered. Surely had the same questions appeared in the combative Fox News debate, no candidate would have been able to spin and deflect so easily.
And the madness didn’t end when the debate did. Angry campaigns tried wresting control of debates from the Republican National Committee, prompting Chairman Reince Preibus to suspend a future debate with NBC and accuse the network of “bad faith” and “gotcha questions, petty and mean-spirited in tone.” And he conveyed his expectation that the media hold a, can you guess it, “substantive” debate.
Rules of rhetoric set out that you tackle the message rather than trying to shoot the messenger. Unfortunately they don’t hold for audiences who haven’t internalized those rules, and who would rather reinforce their prevailing narrative of media bias than confront the fact that reality occasionally disagrees with stump speeches.
What the hysterics of the week showed most clearly was the depth of the victimhood complex to which the Republican Party, establishment and Tea Partiers alike, have sunk. And why should any rational Republican candidate nowadays voluntarily answer a tough question when he can simply cry discrimination and protect his poll numbers?
It’s a neat paradox: Substantive questions are denounced as unfair and the questioners blackballed till there’s no one left to ask them.
Then the base descends into a mess of conspiracies and confirmation biases, the primaries grow ever polarized, and the nominee does not win.
You’ll be able to read all about it in the next RNC autopsy.

Last November, the Project on Fair Representation filed suit against Harvard, alleging that the admissions office discriminates against Asian and Asian-American applicants. Critical to their lawsuit was the fact that the percent of Harvard students identifying as Asian has been constant while the number of Asian college students has risen nationally. Moreover, they argue that the lack of year-to-year fluctuation in the proportion of Asian freshmen indicates a quota. We agree that these statistics are troubling, but the solution is not to eliminate affirmative action. On the contrary, we continue to believe that affirmative action and race-conscious admissions policies are vital elements in ensuring a diverse Harvard that benefits all its students.
To be sure, the statistics cited by the lawsuit deserve investigation. Though this lawsuit seems more like a fishing expedition designed to dredge for the unlikely smoking gun, it is important that potential evidence of a racial quota system be thoroughly explored. It almost goes without saying that any such system would be contrary to the values for which Harvard fundamentally stands. Racial quotas would be in stark contrast to notions of inclusion, open-mindedness, and, indeed, diversity. Placing caps on the number of Asian and Asian-Americans admitted in order to promote other minority students in the name of diversity would be self-defeating.
The lawsuit argues that socioeconomic affirmative action can provide a way to achieve diversity. Here, we strongly agree. Harvard has been a leader in recognizing the burdens that finances can place on high school students. We are proud to attend a university that acknowledges the problem of poverty in its admissions process, and Harvard’s revolutionary Financial Aid Initiative certainly has helped provide free or low-cost education for those less well off.
Of course, we also know that Harvard is not as socioeconomically diverse as it could be. In the most recent freshman survey conducted by The Crimson, over one-third of students reported family incomes above $250,000—representative of approximately 2 percent of Americans. That we have more work to do, however, does not negate the gains we have already made.
Where we diverge from the lawsuit, though, is on the key importance of race. The American story is not a race-blind one told just about the rich and the poor. Both the ongoing national dialogue and campus conversation about criminal justice and policing should remind us that we live in a painfully racially aware society. We know that young black men are much more likely to be killed by police than white men.
Here’s what else we know. We know that job seekers with black names are far less likely to be offered an interview than those with white names. We know that African American and Hispanic professionals are underrepresented in STEM fields. We know that our political institutions are largely dominated by white males. The list goes on.
Fundamentally, our society is still striving toward a not-yet-realized goal of racial equality. Ending Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policy—or all similar policies nationally, as the lawsuit seeks—would starkly reduce access to higher education for African-American and Hispanic students.
Affirmative action is not just an abstract policy issue. As Harvard students, we know firsthand the benefits of diversity. We know that we don’t have all the answers or all the experiences or all the perspectives the world has to offer at the ripe age of 18. We learn not only from professors, but also from each other. We learn from international student sitting next to us in section or the entryway-mate from the other side of the country. And yes, we learn by engaging in frank and honest discussions about race with people who know what it is like to have a skin color different from ours. Harvard should be a transformational place, and if this lawsuit succeeds, it will fail to achieve one fundamental part of that mission.

Following unsuccessful efforts to earn a spot on the stage at televised Democratic presidential debates, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig has ended his unusual bid for president of the United States.
In a YouTube video released Monday entitled “The Democrats have changed the rules,” Lessig said he was no longer running for the nomination, pointing to new restrictive rules for participating in the debates.
Without the chance to stand behind a podium next to more mainstream Democratic candidates like Hillary Clinton, Lessig, who has focused his campaign on election law and campaign finance reform, said that his chances of election had all but vanished. By the Democratic rules, Lessig’s polling numbers were not high enough to qualify for the second Democratic debate, he said. 
“It is now clear that the party won’t let me be a candidate, and I can’t ask people to support a campaign that I know can’t even get before the members of the Democratic party,” Lessig said in the video. “Or to ask my team or my family to make a sacrifice even greater than what they have already made.”
Lessig’s candidacy began over the summer, when he announced his intention to run as a “referendum” candidate to reform campaign finance and election laws. Under Lessig’s original plan, he campaigned on his narrow election reform platform, hoping to pass wide-scale legislation when he took office and then resign the presidency to his vice president. A long-time reform activist, Lessig launched a political action committee in 2014, called the Mayday PAC, to support candidates fighting the influence of big money in politics.
When Lessig raised an initial $1 million by Labor Day, he formally launched his campaign, taking a leave of his absence from his day job as a Harvard Law professor and hitting the trail in New Hampshire.
Soon, though, Lessig’s campaign ran into issues as voters and the media questioned his plans to resign the presidency. In an Oct. 17 essay published in the Atlantic, Lessig changed one of his campaign promises in hopes of increasing his credibility with voters, announcing that he would stay on as president if he were elected.
“If the Democrats won’t take seriously a candidate with a viable, credible, and professionally managed campaign just because it includes a promise to step aside once the work is done, then fine,” he wrote in the essay. “You win. I drop that promise.”
Now, less than a month after his strategy overhaul, Lessig has ended his bid for the Democratic nomination all together, though he promised he would stay committed to the issue of campaign finance reform.
“I must today end my campaign for the Democratic nomination and turn to the question of how best to continue to press for this reform now,” Lessig said.

Former world chess champion and critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin Garry K. Kasparov discussed his new book, Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped, at Emerson Hall Monday evening.
To a packed lecture hall that was standing-room only, Kasparov said that when the Soviet Union collapsed, few would have predicted what he characterized as the dictatorial state of Russia today. To international disapproval and censure, Putin annexed the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory of Crimea in March 2014.
“In 1991, the future was rosy… no one could imagine a K.G.B lieutenant-colonel could be leader of Russia,” Kasparov said.
A Russian opposition politician and chairman of the Human Rights Foundation based in New York, Kasparov argued that inaction and appeasement on the part of Western countries, including the U.S., led to Putin’s rise in power.
“Clinton did too little, Bush did too much, Obama did nothing,” Kasparov said. “There’s a huge territory between war and peace, and it’s called leadership. It’s not like chess, black and white.”
Kasparov, who himself said that his “book is bound to be controversial,” added that while the price of confronting Putin would be high, he predicted that further inaction by Western powers would worsen the situation.
“Tomorrow, the price goes up,” he said. “It’s in our power to make sure that this coming winter won’t be too long, and we’ll see spring before it’s too late.”
As the talk concluded and a line formed for autographs, one man rushed the stage and confronted Kasparov. The man, clearly agitated, said that critics like Kasparov “incited hate.” Following the encounter and threats of his removal, the man left.
Vladislav Sevostianov ’19, originally from St. Petersburg, praised Kasparov’s ideas but said the Putin critic did not detail or outline a solution.
“[Kasparov] did what he set out to do, predicted what is to come, but [he] did not touch on the real issue of what to do,” Sevostianov said. “It is easy to criticize.”
The Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies and student group Harvard Effective Altruism co-sponsored the talk.

Cambridge residents will head to the polls Tuesday to vote in the city’s municipal elections.
Harvard students with roots in Cambridge said their city has a particularly active local politics scene, but students differed in their interest in voting this cycle.
Tamjid A. Rahman ’19, who has lived in Cambridge since childhood, said he plans to vote and hopes his high school friends who are away at college will send in absentee ballots as well.
“Cambridge has a reputation of being politically active,” Rahman said. “We pride ourselves a lot on that.”
Rahman said he is loosely following elections but is hoping one candidate in particular will earn a seat on city council. He did not specify which candidate had won his strong support. Rahman expects to travel to a nearby retirement home to cast his vote.
But other Harvard students with ties to Cambridge said they are less sure about voting tomorrow.
“I used to follow the elections if someone I knew was running, but other than that I don’t follow it too much,” Benjamin F. Altshuler ’19 said.
Altshuler has lived in Cambridge for the last 14 years but said he has not kept up with the elections this cycle.
Altshuler said he does not expect many Harvard students from Cambridge to vote tomorrow, adding that Cambridge politics have limited impact on students while they are on campus.
“Students tend to vote on things relating to Harvard,” Altshuler said. “I don’t think issues in Cambridge really affect Harvard students.”
Recent news of John Sanzone’s exit from the race has not seemed to have affected voting habits among students. John Sanzone recently dropped out of the race after he was found to have posted racist and homophobic comments on a white supremacist website as a teenager.
Polls will be open tomorrow between 7 a.m.and 8 p.m. The Cambridge city government has provided a map and a website on which voters can find their polling locations and precinct information.

UPDATED: November 3, 2015, at 11:18 p.m.
Police responded to a report of an assault and battery at Annenberg Hall late Saturday night, though it is unclear whether this incident was related to a College-wide Halloween party event.
The Harvard University Police Department and Cambridge Police Department also dealt with a large number of noise complaints involving Harvard students over Halloween weekend, according to HUPD police logs.
“We were prepared for a potential uptick in calls for service over the weekend due to the fact that Halloween did fall on a Saturday this year,” CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said.
Many, though not all, noise complaints involved officially unrecognized social organizations. During what was commonly referred to as “Halloweekend” by students, police officers were dispatched to four of Harvard’s eight historically male final clubs.
The activity at the final clubs comes after a period of relative quiet on Mt. Auburn Street, following increased scrutiny from administrators like University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. The Fox Club accepted a group of junior and senior women into its membership this fall, following the move of the Spee Club to invite women to participate in its punch process for the first time.
For some students, “Halloweekend” began on Thursday night. That evening, the Owl Club, a final club, attracted at least two noise complaints related to loud music between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Holyoke Street, HUPD logs reported. After visits from both HUPD officers and CPD officers, the music was lowered to a “reasonable level,” the logs said.
Later that evening, officers responded to noise complaints at the Delphic and Spee Clubs, two other final clubs. At the Delphic Club, HUPD officers were dispatched to a report of a noise complaint at around 12:10 a.m. and found CPD officers present on arrival.
“Officer… spoke to the individual who was in charge and advised them to shut down the party. The individual stated they were just about to leave the club. Officers waited until all individuals left the club,” HUPD logs reported.
Similarly, at the Spee Club, both CPD and HUPD officers responded to a report of a noise complaint at around 12:30 a.m. After advising that the party needed to be shut down, it took “several attempts” for the club to comply, HUPD logs reported.
On Friday night, HUPD responded to a report of loud noise on campus in Mather House. Officers subsequently located the room and advised the occupants to turn the music down, HUPD logs reported.
Early Saturday morning at around 12:45 a.m., HUPD officers were dispatched to another report of a noise complaint, this time at the A.D. Club, another final club. CPD were again “on scene” when HUPD officers arrived. Though officers “advised the individual who was operating the party to lower noise level,” police logs reported, “the individual decided to shut down the party.” Officers assisted with this process.
On Halloween night itself, when various student groups hosted a College-wide party at Annenberg Hall, there were no reports of noise complaints in the HUPD logs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of undergraduates convened in Lowell House on Monday night for an off-the-record discussion about the College’s social scene in light of increased scrutiny on single gender social organizations.
Although organizers of the discussion originally indicated that the event would be on the record, meaning it would be open to the press, they later double backed, writing on a Facebook event page that it was “OFF THE RECORD.”
The page did not offer an explanation for the change, which effectively barred student journalists from entry to the discussion. Several interns at the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, the organization that sponsored the event, did not respond to requests for comment.
The forum, entitled “The Changing Social Scene at Harvard,” follows an increase in attention to social life on campus and the role of administrators in offering up open social spaces to undergraduates. As administrators—from University President Drew G. Faust to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—have publicly criticized the College’s unrecognized male final clubs, undergraduates have decried a social scene that some say is too stratified.
Most recently, two historically all-male final clubs, the Fox and Spee Clubs, have moved to admit women to their memberships. Although undergraduate leaders of the Fox indicated in a letter to club alumni last month that the choice was their own, officers also suggested that Harvard administrators have put heavy pressure on final clubs to admit women, writing that they feared potential repercussions if they did not formulate plans to go co-ed by Nov. 1.
Several students who attended the Monday night event declined to comment afterward. Undergraduate Council Representative and vice presidential candidate Daniel V. Banks ’17 said the discussion was productive, but would not offer more specifics. “College administrators” were expected to attend to the discussion, according to the event’s Facebook page.
“I went to the event to listen and learn from the students’ experiences. I feel it is important to truly hear the plurality of student voices and our students’ aspirations for creating a more inclusive and fun social experience at the College,” Khurana wrote in an emailed statement.
In private, Khurana has met with undergraduate and graduate leaders of final clubs, but has offered few details on these interactions. Although he has alluded to an upcoming set of recommendations about the College social scene that he is preparing, he has declined to comment on whether he has instructed male final clubs to submit proposals for going co-ed.
Khurana has also declined to describe his involvement, if any, in the Spee Club’s decision to go co-ed and refused to rule out whether administrators would consider barring undergraduates from joining male final clubs.
In an effort to bolster social life in Houses, some administrators have offered up new spaces and sources of funding for student events.

World-renowned fashion designer Calvin Klein spoke of how his avant-garde, personal approach to design led to his successful career Monday night at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The lecture, sponsored by the Rouse Visiting Artist Fund, attracted an audience of about 500 people in both the Piper Auditorium and a nearby overflow room.
Klein detailed his involvement with every aspect of bringing his ideas to fruition while leading his company's brand to become one of the most iconic in the world. In his tenure as CEO, Klein’s minimalist vision of fashion, fragrance, and beauty drew praise from the fashion industry.
However, Klein said he often faced backlash and skepticism from critics.
Of note, in the 1980s, on the heels of his company’s lucrative Calvin Klein Jeans campaign, he said he encountered significant pushback from the public for the provocative nature of the advertisements. However, he said he was merely “push[ing] the envelope.”
This attitude extended to the marketing strategy for one of the company’s most successful men’s fragrance products, Eternity, which deviated from the message of “macho and masculine” to highlight the familial roles of men. Klein said the advertisements prominently featured children alongside men and women, something unheard of at the time.
Klein also emphasized the intimate connection he had with products like his perfume line.
“All of these fragrances were tied to my life... I wanted people to know there was a designer behind all these things we were making,” he said.
Despite notching impressive profits, he said growing frustration with the mounting business duties of his company eventually led to its sale, announced in December 2002.
“I was more involved in the management of the business… I started thinking, I’ve given my whole life to this work; there's a whole world out there,” said Klein, who is now actively involved in charitable work through Harlem Village Academies, as well as personal housing and design projects.
During the question-and-answer session, one audience member questioned his brand’s involvement with the sexual objectification of human bodies, an assertion to which Klein objected.
“I don’t think of fashion that way,” Klein said. “I think of creating clothes that make people feel good and look good...It’s trying to create something that can bring value into someone’s life.”
To many in the audience, Klein served as a role model in terms of his approach toward his work.
“It’s inspiring in terms of the style of design, and how he has a good clear vision of beauty...and his attitude,” Dan Zhang, a student at the Graduate School of Design, said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Referenda focusing on breakfast-time meetings, all-male final clubs, and sexual assault are now on the ballot for the November Undergraduate Council election, and supporters are in the process of gathering student signatures.
The three ballot items have until Monday, Nov. 9 to collect the required 670 signatures. A referendum represents the council’s official position if a majority of students vote in the election and a majority of the vote favors the ballot question. However, approved referenda in no way bind the University to take action. The questions will appear on the ballots with statements in support, and any student is free to write a statement against any of the referenda, according to UC Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg '16. 
One proposal asks students if a provision should be added to the College’s student handbook essentially prohibiting students from joining all-male final clubs. Another seeks to end student breakfast meetings, and a third calls on the central administration to increase levels of student input in changing Harvard’s sexual assault policy.
A referendum to add an anti-final club provision to the student handbook originally called on Harvard administrators to “reclaim administrative control” over the clubs. Jordan T. Weiers ’16, the sponsor of the final club referendum and a critic of the clubs, decided to change the question in order to take a more straight-forward approach in controlling final clubs.
“The University’s authority to do the previous referendum was murky at best,” Weiers said, referencing previous media coverage that cast doubt on the original referendum’s legal basis.
As of Wednesday evening, Weiers’s rewritten referendum had 135 of the 670 signatures required to appear on the ballot later this month. The measure now asks if a “provision be added to the Harvard College Student Handbook making enrollment at the College contingent upon abstaining from membership and participation in traditionally male final clubs."
The sexual assault policy referendum, submitted by Julia R. Geiger ’16 on behalf of Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student group advocating for modifications to Harvard’s sexual assault policy, asks if administrators should be required to open policy task force meetings to all interested students. Earlier this semester, representatives from the anti-sexual assault advocacy group questioned University President Drew G. Faust about the possibility of increasing student input when discussing changes sexual assault policy.
Historically, Geiger claimed, changes to Harvard’s sexual assault policies have been made without student feedback. The proposal from Our Harvard Can Do Better has gathered the most signatures of any of the questions, with 235 of the 670 signatures gathered.
Lastly, a referendum asking student opinion about breakfast meetings seeks to address the “collective cultural problem” of the early morning meetings, according to co-sponsor Colin J. F. Diersing ’16. Diersing said that breakfast meetings have the tendency to be both “unpleasant” and “unproductive,” because meetings’ attendees would rather remain sleeping.
“They generally could be rescheduled for a time later in the day, if they just tried a little harder,” Diersing said. He added that he does not want to detract attention from more serious campus-wide issues with his referendum, which has 45 signatures. The meeting measure was submitted by Kim F. Soffen ’16.
A fourth referendum, which asks students if the Pusey Library should be converted into a freshmen-oriented social space, will automatically appear on the ballot, since it received over a two-thirds approval by the UC itself.

UPDATED: November 3, 2015, at 1:17 a.m.
A third pair of College students has entered the race to become the next leaders of the Undergraduate Council.
Nick E. Gajdzik ’17 of Kirkland House and Jeffrey M. Ott ’17 of Kirkland House declared on Nov. 1 their candidacies for president and vice president, respectively, according to the UC’s Election Commissions Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
They join Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17 as well as William A. Greenlaw ’17 and William F. Morris IV ’17 in the running towards leading the Council.
All three tickets had until 11:59 p.m. on Monday, Nov. 2, to gather 150 student signatures, a requirement to appear on the ballot later this month.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 3, 2015
An earlier version of this article misnamed Daniel A. Ott '18 of Lowell House as having declared his candidacy for the Undergraduate Council vice presidency. In fact, Jeffrey M. Ott '17 of Kirkland House declared his candidacy for that position.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Weekend sweeps are becoming a new trend for the No. 12 Harvard men’s water polo team.
After winning all five games at the Santa Clara Bronco Invite last weekend, the Crimson (17-8, 9-3 CWPA Northern) recorded two victories on Saturday and one on Sunday at home to improve its winning streak to eight.
The Crimson had its final regular season contest on Sunday against Iona, but Saturday’s game against Fordham had added importance—Harvard was able to emerge victorious on senior night.
“We’re really confident in ourselves and the way we’re playing right now,” freshman attacker Nathan Ondracek said. “We’re really turning it on for the end of the season, which is great going into the last two weekends.”
Following the weekend sweep, head coach Ted Minnis has 94 career wins, which is the second most all-time for a Harvard water polo coach.
HARVARD 19, IONA 9
After prevailing in the first two games of the weekend, Harvard found the back of the net early and often against the Gaels (5-13, 3-7).
Backed by a wide range of scorers, the Crimson was able to score 11 goals by the end of the first half, six of which were unanswered.
Senior attacker Noah Harrison scored back-to-back goals as part of the 6-0 run. The Huntington Beach, Calif., native also scored a game-high five goals.
Freshman attacker Nick Bunn recorded a hat-trick, his second of the year.
All three Crimson goalies got playing time in net, and despite four straight Iona goals to finish the game, Harvard’s defensive unit was strong, keeping the ball out of its half for much of the game.
HARVARD 12, FORDHAM 7
True to its name, senior night was all about the seniors in the pool. Facing off against Fordham (16-13, 5-7), Harvard commanded an early lead and never relinquished it, and several seniors had big impacts that led to a win for the Crimson.
“They’ve set the bar really high for the younger guys and the future people that will come here and play for us,” Minnis said. “I’m very proud of them, and I’m glad we’ve still got another couple of weeks with them.”
Harvard jumped out to a 6-3 lead after two quarters of play with the help of goals by co-captain Ben Zepfel and senior attacker Blake Lee. Senior goalie Colin Woolway also aided the first half effort, adding two cross-pool assists.
Lee kept up his offensive impact in the second half, notching back-to-back goals to put the Crimson up, 8-3. Zepfel followed his teammate’s lead, adding two straight goals of his own.
Fordham managed to record three straight goals and cut Harvard’s lead to three, but Ondracek’s tally and senior attacker Christopher Miao’s goal secured the Crimson win.
HARVARD 14, ST. FRANCIS (N.Y.) 11
In the closest game of the weekend, the Crimson prevailed over St. Francis after four quarters of back-and-forth lead changes.
At the start of the fourth quarter, the Crimson trailed, 10-9. After a goal by sophomore utility Colin Chiapello to knot the score at 10 apiece, St. Francis center defender Ilija Djuretic answered with his game-high fifth score to put the Terriers up by one.
But as the clock ticked down, Harvard rallied and took control of the contest. Lee recorded his third goal, Harrison netted two straight scores, and junior 2-meter defender Dan Stevens added another to give the Crimson a 14-11 advantage.
“We were confident the whole way,” Ondracek said. “We knew they were going to come out tough, and we knew we each had to play our game and stay with it. We’re really in shape, and so by the fourth quarter we were able to put them away.”
From the start of the weekend’s opening game, no team was able to jump out to a large lead. Neither Harvard nor St. Francis led by a margin of more than one goal in the first half, and after two quarters of play the Terriers held a slim lead over the home team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Sunday, Harvard women’s crew took on a field comprising many of the top teams in the country and came away with some strong finishes. The Radcliffe heavyweight and lightweight teams travelled to Lake Carnegie in Princeton, N.J., for the Princeton 3-Mile Chase.
The Radcliffe heavyweights faced nearly every team they will see in the spring season in the varsity eight event. Three Black and White crews competed, and the A boat crossed the line in 15:21 to end up 13th out of 65 boats. The Radcliffe crew was narrowly edged by University of Virginia’s D entry, which crossed the line less than half a second ahead of the Black and White.
The Radcliffe first boat topped a number of the top entries from opposing teams, including Penn, Dartmouth, and Navy. Ancient Eight rivals, Brown, Yale, Princeton, Cornell, and Columbia managed to top Radcliffe on the day.
“I think we stayed internal and therefore were lacking the aggression and intensity to get the results we were hoping to see at this race,” sophomore heavyweight Katherine Playfair said. “We were more composed than [in] our previous race, and that was both a strength and a flaw for our boat.”
Radcliffe’s B boat also had a strong showing and finished 15 seconds behind the A entry for 21st overall. The second boat was the fifth fastest B entry across the line, and beat out several programs’ A crews.
Rounding out the field for Radcliffe, the heavyweight C boat ended up 42nd overall and topped the third boats from a number of rival teams.
The Radcliffe lightweights had a successful day competing in the same event as the heavyweights. The lightweight A boat ended up 18th overall against heavyweight opponents and was the fastest lightweight boat, beating out the closest competitor, Princeton, by 20 seconds and topped crosstown rival Boston University’s first lightweight boat by more than 30 seconds.
“We had targets on our backs this weekend and we wanted to prove again that we were the fastest lightweight crew on the water,” said junior lightweight co-captain Ruby Emberling. “ Overall, the team had great results, posting winning times that were much more decisive than in Head of the Charles. It was a good sign that we could race so well even away from our home course.”
The Radcliffe lightweight B boat also impressed. It was the fastest lightweight JV on the day, edging out BU’s second lightweight entry by seven seconds.
“Our boat had a very aggressive race,” Emberling said. “It was great to feel it all pull together and finish ahead of both of our lightweight competitors.”
Earlier in the weekend, Radcliffe sent a small contingent of athletes to Mercer Lake in West Windsor, NJ for the Collegiate Small Boat Challenge.
The regatta pitted Radcliffe against an unusual mix of competitors, with Cornell the only other Ivy League team present. The Black and White also competed in singles, doubles, and pairs, in addition to their standard eights and fours.
In the pair, Radcliffe’s top finishers were senior lightweights Gabrielle McNeill and Naomi Lang, who ended up 11th overall against exclusively heavyweight opponents.
Freshman lightweights Josie Thiele and Marina Felix raced in the double and took first place in the B final for a seventh-place finish overall.
Radcliffe’s strongest performance of the regatta came from sophomore heavyweight Abigail Parker, who bested 14 competitors to finish first in the single. The Massachusetts native pulled away from the second-place Syracuse entry for a five-second victory.
The team will look to build on the result and improve heading into the end of the fall season.
“I felt that our team definitely made progress since the Head of the Charles,” Playfair said. “We understand that we have a long way to go until we are at a place where we feel satisfied with our performance, but this [weekend] was a small step in the right direction.”

What is one to do when one misses Halloween at school? Bring Halloween to the regatta, of course. The Harvard men’s lightweight team brought the holiday spirit to Lake Carnegie, where it looked to improve on its strong performance in the Head of the Charles. The team traveled to Princeton, N.J., to avenge its loss to Princeton in the Princeton 3-Mile Chase.
With little wind and partially sunny skies, racing conditions were perfect on Lake Carnegie. In dealing with any pressure to avenge its loss against Princeton two weeks ago, the team decided to simply look at this regatta as simply a step on the way towards developing as a team.
“For us the fall is just about taking the race for granted and just providing check marks along the way for our training” co-captain Sam Frum said. “So right now we’re just really focused on what we’re doing over here in Cambridge.”
The team’s day started off with the Varsity Lightweight Eight final, in which Harvard had three boats. The A boat, coxed by junior Charlie Zhang, and with Frum, juniors Jack Kelly and Christopher Wales, sophomores Andre Dempsey, Daniel Bridgwater, Niels Laurberg, Andre Dupuis, and senior Ian Klein, completed the 2.75 mile course in 13:57.47, earning seventh place out of 32 boats. At the Chase split, the boat was just four seconds behind Navy’s A boat, which was in fourth place behind the A boats of Cornell, Princeton, and Yale. It was three seconds off Princeton’s B boat, and 20 seconds behind the first place boat, Cornell’s A boat, which finished with a time of 13:37.97.
The V8 B boat finished 21st with a time of 14:48.98, and the C boat crossed the finish line at 15:43.21, placing 31st.
“The varsity squad, I would say, had a mixed bag of results at the end of the day,” Frum said. “We had positive results with the smaller boats, like the coxed fours, but a bit of a tough go with the eight piece.”
In their first time at the competition, the freshmen earned sixth place. They took their Halloween spirit to a new level, and did so in style--literally, as both competing boats rowed dressed up as dots, giving spectators a treat.
“I think the frosh were definitely the highlight,” Klein said. “They had a really good go out there, they had a lot of fun with it. It was the first race that they actually got to race against some of the guys at their level that they’re going to be racing next year, so it was cool for them to see how that stacked up.”
The A boat, which featured a new lineup, with Andrew Wilkins, Andrew Sterne, Josh Kuppersmith, David Wexner, Nick Kochanek, Spencer Kaplan, Eryk Dobrushkin, and James Jacoby, finished in 14:16.55, outpaced by first-place finisher California by almost a minute, and besting the Tigers by half a second. The B boat finished a little over a minute later, with a time of 15:20.24.
Four boats competed in the Lightweight 4 final Sunday afternoon. The A boat, with Zhang, Kelly, Dempsey, and Bridgwater, had the best and closest finish of the day, coming in third place of 31 boats, at 15:26.56, less than a second behind Cornell’s A boat. The team was 12 seconds behind the winner, Yale A. The B boat came in seventh place, with a time of 15:35.57. The next two Harvard boats finished in 26th and 27th place.
“For us, this is really just a ‘we’re going to put our hard hats on and get ready for the winter to go to work,” Frum said. “We’re going to hit the rowing machines, and the Charles until it freezes over, and really try to get better out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the recent start of the NBA season, and the NFL season in the swing of things, it’s time to check up on how a few Harvard alums have been doing in these two professional sports leagues:
Jeremy Lin ’10 has become a bit of an NBA journeyman over his career, playing for five different teams in his six-year career. This past offseason, after the conclusion of a middling Lakers campaign in which he averaged 11.2 points and 4.6 assists, Lin signed a two-year contract with the Charlotte Hornets, where he will serve as the backup point guard behind Kemba Walker. The Hornets are expected to compete for the 8-seed in the weaker Eastern Conference, with the most recent ESPN projections ranking them as the 10th best team in the conference.
Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 has suffered misfortune as of late, breaking his thumb in last Sunday’s game against the Oakland Raiders. The New York Jets quarterback—who got the starting nod this season after presumptive starter Geno Smith broke his jaw in a preseason locker-room scuffle—is out for an undefined amount of time. Meanwhile, the Jets—who have lost their last two games—are scrambling to find a replacement quarterback. Before the injury, Fitzpatrick was having one of his best seasons, with an 86.5 passer rating and 11 thrown touchdowns.
Over the last two seasons, Kyle Jusczcyk ’13 has seen playing time as the starting fullback for the Baltimore Ravens. Jusczcyk already has two touchdowns for the season—more than his other two seasons combined—and while he doesn’t see consistent touches, he plays a key role in the Baltimore offense as a ball-handler and blocker. The Ravens are 2-6 on the season.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Cameron Brate ’14 scored his first career touchdown last Sunday in a win against the Atlanta Falcons, pulling in a 20-yard heave from quarterback Jameis Winston. Earlier in the game, Brate had another big highlight, nabbing a 28-yarder in the second quarter. While Brate hasn’t seen much playing time yet this season—and will likely take a backseat once Austin Seferian-Jenkins returns from injury—his success last game could be indicative of a bigger role in the games to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior goalie Molly Tissenbaum’s first career shutout for Harvard Women’s ice hockey on Friday earned her The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week title. But in a big week for Crimson athletics, quite a few Harvard athletes showed impressive performances deserving acknowledgement on the runners-up list.
Elizabeth Jacobson, Field Hockey
The senior forward is leaving her mark in the record books after notching three goals for Harvard this week. The New Jersey native executed her signature backhand spin-move for her ninth goal this season in the team’s 3-2 loss to Boston University on Wednesday. In the last home game of her Crimson career, Jacobson recorded two more goals in Harvard’s 4-1 thrashing of Dartmouth, earning a tie for eighth place for goals in a season in Harvard history.
Abigail Parker, Radcliffe Heavyweight Crew
Parker was the only member of Radcliffe Heavyweight Crew to take on the Small Boat Challenge, and emerged victorious in the 1A singles race on Saturday. The junior bested five other opponents, and went on to compete as part of the Radcliffe heavyweight eight in the Princeton Chase held at Princeton, N.J., the next day.
Miye D'Oench, Women’s Ice Hockey
In another strong performance from Harvard’s team this weekend, the senior forward tied her career-high of three points in a game. In the team’s 3-2 victory over St. Lawrence, the New York found the net twice in the second period, recording her first career shorthanded goal, and completed a critical assist for the game-winning goal.
Justice Shelton-Mosey, Football
With just seconds on the clock, the rookie caught a pass from senior quarterback Scott Hosch for a game-winning two-yard touchdown reception on Saturday. The freshman was pivotal for Harvard offense with a career-high of nine receptions and 71 yards as Harvard came back from a 13-0 deficit to take a 14-13 victory over Dartmouth.
Courtney Smith, Women’s Cross Country
In her fourth first-place finish for Harvard this season, the sophomore placed third of 90 runners at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. Finishing just 0.5 seconds behind the second-place runner, the Pennsylvania native’s performance earned her a spot in the All-Ivy first team.
Jimmy Vesey, Men’s Ice Hockey
The captain notched four points in a historic 7-0 season-opener against Dartmouth on Saturday. With a goal and three assists, Vesey led the team in in its largest margin of victory since 2008 and its first seven-goal season opener in almost 20 years. Vesey went on to contribute a goal in Harvard’s 5-2 win over the Big Green the next night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When junior goalie Molly Tissenbaum skated out onto the ice on Friday night, she was making just her second career start for the No. 8/7 Harvard women’s ice hockey team (1-1-1, 1-1-1 ECAC) against the 2014 national champions Clarkson (9-0-2, 0-0-2).
Cue the nerves?
Tissenbaum was already in the zone.
“I knew it was going to be a good night when my one-on-one shooter [junior defender] Briana Mastel and I had hit all of our targets in the warm-up before the game,” Tissenbaum said. “When all five shots end up where they should be, it’s going to be a good night. After that, it’s just a matter of keeping it simple.”
Sixty-five minutes of play later, Tissenbaum headed back to the locker room having shut out the fourth-ranked team in the country, marking the first time in her Crimson career she had finished a game with a shutout.
Before Friday, Clarkson had averaged a strong 4.5 goals per game, with its leading scorer Cayley Mercer already at an impressive 18 points.
But the Golden Knights drew a blank in Cambridge, with the impassable Tissenbaum making a perfect 23 saves on all 23 attempts.
The game was a tight affair, with both goaltenders proving too much for the offenses.
The defensive battle eventually ended in a scoreless tie.
Any mistake would have surely meant curtains. But in this pressure cooked situation, Tissenbaum was not fazed.
“At that point, it’s a matter of reaction,” Tissenbaum said. “And doing what I’ve been doing for my whole life as a goalie, which is focus on each puck as if it’s the biggest save of the game.”
With this mentality, the junior goalie was able to rise up to the challenge in just her ninth game in two years.
But this came as no surprise to her teammates.
Tissenbaum has a past littered with injuries and in particular was out of the sport for six months from a concussion.
She came back strong and has continued to put herself on the line for the team.
“We have full confidence in her,” co-captain Michelle Picard said.
While the goalie in any sport should be the automatic first name on the team sheet, the Crimson has started all three goaltenders this year in just four games.
Senior Emerance Maschmeyer, the regular starter last season, was jjust became the 10th Crimson athlete to be elected as an All-American.
The other junior goalie, Brianna Laing, was considered the second string last year, having started seven contests.
But on Friday, those at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center rose to applaud Tissenbaum at the start of the contest.
She did not disappoint, with a flurry of glove saves late in the third period.
Her efforts ultimately led to a stalemate and the shutout, the best prize for any goalie.
However, the junior goaltender was quick to recognize her teammates on a night when she was in the spotlight.
“All three of us are able to play and are able to play well at this level, but it’s always a battle to start,” Tissenbaum said. “It’s the best kind of competition because I know that I have to bring my best everyday, but I also know that Bri and Em have my back, just as I have their backs when they play. I owe a lot of who I am as a goalie to those two.”
The goalies have propelled each other to excellence.
But perhaps the greatest significance in Tissenbaum’s performance is the assurance that Harvard has three talented and battle proven goalies available each game.
The trio poses one of those cliché great problems to have for Crimson coach Katey Stone. The goalies’ performance has caused a selection issue.
Harvard is spoiled for choice when it comes to the goaltender position. But the result can only be positive.
“No matter who is in net we always have a chance to win the game,” Picard said. “Knowing that we have that rock star performance back there is great to know. Molly stepped up big time [Friday night].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a busy weekend for Harvard sailing, six different boats competed across three different regattas on the Charles River. The three regattas delivered contrasting results for the Crimson, highlighted by a third-place finish at MIT.
ERWIN SCHELL TROPHY
Racing in the tournament’s 74th edition, the two Harvard boats combined to propel the Crimson to a third-place finish out of 18 teams with 153 points. This performance earned the pair a berth in this month’s Atlantic Coast Championship.
Co-captains skipper Andrew Mollerus and crew Sydney Karnovsky, both named to the 2015 ICSA All-Academic Sailing Team, represented Harvard in the A Division. Senior skipper Marek Zaleski and junior crew Julia Lord featured in the B Division.
Mollerus and Karnovsky helped the Crimson jump out to a fast start on Saturday. The duo finished no lower than sixth in their first six races, winning the sixth and putting Harvard in the lead by seven points.
Other strong finishers included Boston University, who finished with a regatta best 148 points, and Boston College, who recorded 153 points but edged out the Crimson in the head-to-head tiebreaker, relegating Harvard to third.
A first-place finish by Zaleski and Lord in their second-to-last heat put the Crimson within touching distance of first, but a subsequent 13th-place round allowed the Terriers and Eagles to regain the advantage.
THE VICTORIA URN
Four Harvard women flew the Crimson flag on the Charles in this year’s Victoria Urn, New England’s qualifying race for the Women’s Atlantic Coast Championship. The race hosts came in twelfth with 216 points, just short of making the cut.
Sophomore skipper Taylor Ladd and junior crew Emma Wheeler raced in the A Division, while freshman skipper Taylor Gavula and senior crew Kristina Jakobson sailed in the B Division. The lack of wind on Saturday made racing difficult for the competitors, sailing in Flying Juniors. The group attempted to start a number of races but was only able to finish two.
“It was kind of a bummer,” Gavula said in reference to the race cancellations. “That was frustrating, because we worked really hard to get ready, and it ended up being nothing.”
Despite the rough conditions, Harvard got off to a strong start, sitting in the eighth and final qualifying position after five races. Things began to unravel soon after, however, with both boats stringing together double-digit place finishes.
The disqualification of Ladd and Wheeler’s dinghy in race nine was the nail in the Crimson’s proverbial coffin. While Ladd and Wheeler protested the foul to a panel of judges, they were deemed to have committed the foul and were subsequently DQ’d.
“[Sunday] was pretty tough,” Gavula said. “It was a competitive fleet, but I’m really lucky that I got to sail in this regatta as a freshman. We could have been more consistent, as always, but it was pretty good for my first qualifier.”
NICKERSON TROPHY
Harvard’s youngest sailors also participated in the Nickerson Trophy this weekend, an invite-only freshman regatta hosted by Tufts. The boats combined for a score of 135, putting them eighth out of the twenty schools that competed.
Freshmen skipper Jackson Wagner and crew Divya Arya competed in the A Division while skipper Nick Karnovsky and crew Alejandra Resendiz paired up to feature in the B Division.
Arya and Wagner finished first in their opening heat as Harvard sat third after three rounds. The good results disappeared quickly, however, with Harvard posting four bottom-half races in a row, slipping from third to 10th by round five.
“The wind was pretty light so we had fewer races,” Arya said. “This made the regatta quite challenging, especially competing against talented freshmen. We didn’t do as well as we’d hoped, but learned a lot about college sailing.”
A first-place run by Karnovsky and Resendiz in the second-to-last round helped Harvard make a late push into eighth, capping off an ultimately successful weekend.

Though undergraduate houses are now assigned randomly, each has maintained idiosyncrasies from the good ole’, pre-90s days when students could self-select. Flyby asked around campus to find the top three wackiest house traditions, both well-known and otherwise, that have long endured.
Festivus
While you may not find this holiday marked in calendars, Cabot observes it dutifully.
Seinfeld enthusiasts will remember that the celebration—as seen in the sitcom—includes a banquet, an unadorned aluminum pole, exercises in the "Airing of Grievances" and "Feats of Strength", and the labeling of easily-explained events as "Festivus miracles". In an email obtained by Flyby, Cabot Housemaster Stephanie Khurana wrote of the “delicious menu of Thai, Chinese, Indian, Mexican food and much more!” offered in last year’s Festivus. Students also had the opportunity to burn their “grievances and anxieties,” according to the email, and participate in “feats of talent,” whether “planned or spontaneous,” and strive for honor.
Flyby has yet to hear if eating the most HUDS chili constitutes such a feat. Journalistic integrity prevents us from saying a conclusive ‘yes,’ though we’d like to think so.
Middle School Talent Show
 Putting gum in your lab partner’s hair or removing the sticky wad from your frizzy curls. Sitting with the rad kids in leather jackets and Camel cigs or sitting with no one at all. Making fun of the girl with the pink Tamagotchi or setting alarms to punctually feed your digital pet.
Yeah, we’d rather not remember middle school either.
But Pfoho tutor Jamie Ciocco sees those three hellish years as more than a Freudian experiment gone wrong. For the past 4 years, he has co-hosted the Carl & Carol Pforzheimer Middle School Talent Show, where students perform as middle school versions of themselves—at their “sullen, angsty, awkward, gawky best.” For his part, Ciocco acts as a cranky math teacher and Mathletics coach, Pfighting Pfactorials, along the way. Another tutor, Kate Harrington, plays the titular Ms. Harrington, a supportive English Teacher and “self-esteemtress” who cautiously reminds the faux tweens that this, too, shall pass. Ah, Pfhome sweet Pfhome.
Ciocco advises interested students to aim for “sometimes funny-funny, sometimes overly-serious-funny, sometimes just awkward-funny”
“If you mess up,” he says, “it just becomes funnier.”
Mather Lather
 That’s right— we’ve saved the least G-rated for last. Upperclassmen may wince or smirk while recalling their experience at the concrete box’s spring foam party, Mather Lather. Students show up in bikinis and boxers, dancing in layers upon layers of suds. According to the New York Times, more than 1,000 students crammed into the dining hall in 2003. HUPD then had to shut it down because students were falling over one another.
If you’re looking to attend for the soapy cleanse, think again. Word in the Yard is that you’ll need to take more than a few showers at the end of the night.
Sections
There are a wide ranges of initiatives and important discussions taking place on campus this fall, including controversies about the role of final clubs within the college’s social scene and questions about the changing visions of the Black Lives Matter movement, but one that has fallen under the radar is the movement to end breakfast meetings at Harvard.
Before you push this aside as another random Facebook event that you need to ignore, it’s worth noting that the group has created a UC referendum eligibility petition for you to sign if you agree– they mean it. So even though only 20 people have marked that they are “attending” the event (with 12 people interested), the group’s demands may have started to gain some traction. What do you think? Should Harvard ban breakfast meetings from occurring in favor of guaranteeing Harvard students more sleep?
Sections
In the midst of a College-wide discussion about increasing social spaces on campus, the UC has proposed a referendum asking students if Pusey Library should instead be turned into a “freshmen-oriented social space.” Is this a good call? We’ll leave that to voters to decide, but for those of you unsure, Flyby weighs the pros and cons of turning libraries into social spaces.
PROS
Turning Pusey into a social space would be great for those shy freshman looking to get down in a library, but not quite ready to cross one of the Three Things off of their list. It also would at least double the amount of library-related socializing on campus, which is currently limited to procrastinating in Lamont Cafe or getting shushed for breathing too loudly in Widener.
Besides, doesn’t Harvard have like 90 libraries around the world? It’s not like anyone would notice if one was missing, right?
Perhaps most importantly, though, note the words “freshmen-oriented.” Now picture yourself as a freshman again: baby face, lanyard, and everything. Except now, instead of wandering the Quad or trying to figure out which river house is Eliot and which is Winthrop, imagine that you’re going to a party in the Yard. And it’s not a crowded pregame in Canaday full of sweaty guys and loud music. No, it’s a real party. In the space that once was Pusey Library, a place that likely in your years at Harvard you have never visited. What a time to be alive.
CONS
The biggest drawback to turning Pusey into a party space is perhaps best embodied by the words of one Flyby staff writer’s father: “I’m paying for you to go to college so you can learn, not so you can sit around and drink beer.” Okay Dad, whatever. Sure, parties are fun ways to release the stresses of daily life as an undergrad, but Harvard does also have an obligation to provide access to materials for its graduate students. And it’s a well-known fact that grad students are too busy to have fun– just look at your TFs. They probably want to turn social spaces into libraries.
And how far would Harvard be willing to go? Hosting post-CS50-office-hour raves in Loker Reading Room? Replacing Faculty Dinner with Faculty-Student beer pong tournaments? Changing Advanced Standing to Advanced Keg-Standing? It would be an awful thing for Harvard to try and force us to have fun.
Sections
Although Flyby hopes for your sake that you already knew this, sophomore fall is the time when students of the college must declare their concentration, and along with it, plan out every single class that they would like to take in the next four years in a “plan of study”– because any normal Harvard student knows exactly what they’d like to take for the entirety of their college experience as first semester sophomores. This year, the platform of declaring has moved online, but the process remains largely the same: sophomores will need to declare by November 12 (less than two weeks, people) and meet with their new concentration advisors and house advisors for approval beforehand.
There’s just one catch: the plan of study tool is on the my.harvard page, and the tool is still not available for actual use. That’s right, people, the countdown is on until the days sophomores will have to declare their concentration, but it looks like we’re all going to need to wait for a bit, as the Harvard tool currently promises: “Within the coming months a new Plan of Study and Declare Concentration service will become available directly from my.harvard.” If by “months” Harvard means “about a week,” however, the site might be running exactly on schedule.
For now, as we wait for the eagerly anticipated release of this new wing of my.harvard, declaring sophomores can prepare by reaching out to their sophomore advisors, meeting with their concentration advisors, looking up the course requirements for their concentration, and thinking deeply about the meaning and purpose of their respective lives. Concentrations are a defining part of anyone’s character, of course, so these existential crises are just par for the course. Happy contemplation, sophomores.

The night before Halloween, the Boston Pops accompanied the classic horror film “Nosferatu” with a brand new score composed by eight students from the Berklee College of Music. While this screening of “Nosferatu” revived the classic traditions of silent film, it also innovated upon the genre, using unorthodox instruments such as the Theremin and a modular synthesizer. This Roving Reporter ventured into this eccentric mix of Halloween horror to ask the composers, audience members, and even a theremin player what they thought of the screening.

Marina Smith, audience member
Roving Reporter: Is there a scene where “Hotline Bling” can be incorporated into the score?
MS: When Ellen Hutter calls Nosferatu through her window. That’s definitely “Hotline Bling” material.

Helen Murray, audience member
RR: What does Count Orlok [the vampire in “Nosferatu”] do when it’s not Halloween?
HM: I imagine he summers in France, where the steak is rare and the coffins have a Parisian flair.

Kevin Chang, audience member
RR: How do you think “Nosferatu” manages to be scary without all the blood and gore?
KC: It’s all about the psychology. We imagine the monster, and we tailor him to our fears. And after we have spent so much time coming up with the monster, we can’t help but feel invested in him.

Shannon Grimm, audience member
RR: If you were a vampire, what would be your abode of the undead?
SG: My car. It gets pretty grungy and dark in there. It’s an all-black car, and I could really use that. It’s basically a coffin.

Diego Mendez, audience member
RR: Do you think Count Orlok is just a little bit misunderstood, or is he evil through and through?
DM: It’s hard to say. Maybe he’s just really lonely. He was cooped up in his castle on the top of the hill, and then he turns into the creepy old man across the street.
RR: Have you ever lived near a Count Orlok?
DM: Yes, definitely. Maybe we all have our Count Orloks near us.

Thea North, audience member
RR: Which politician does Count Orlok most remind you of?
TN: I would say Ben Carson because he’s so sedate and slow-moving.

Wani Han, composer
RR: What ideas of horror did you try to incorporate into this film score?
WH: The score has to be spooky…. It’s an old movie—the special effects aren’t that great, so we had to make up for that with the music.

Emily Joseph, composer
RR: What musical techniques did you use to create this “spookiness?”
EJ: A lot of our scary effects come from extended techniques on all our instruments. We used horn flutters for the werewolf’s howls. We used string harmonics, and we tried to get a little bit of the “Psycho” flavor into the music to make the really scary moments happen.

Matthew Morris, composer
RR: What scene was the best part to compose for?
MM: My favorite part was reel three, which was when Thomas Hutter is having dinner for the first time in the castle. All the things that are happening…are so exciting because we finally get to see Nosferatu.

Amit Cohen, composer
RR: If you could incorporate a pop song into the score for “Nosferatu,” what would it be?
AC: A pop song. Wow…It would have to be Britney Spears’s “Toxic.”

Rob Schwimmer, theremin player
RR: Did you have any input into the theremin part of the score?
RS: Theremin players are few and far between, so the composers can write the parts for it, ]but it’s not always sure if it’s going to work until you get a real theremin player there. It can make sense on paper, but it might not necessarily speak well, so you have to tuck stuff in there and try to do things that work well on the instrument and let the instrument speak.
RR: What voice does the theremin add to the score?
RS: It’s the creepy instrument! It has a long history of being a creepy instrument, and what you do to make it creepier is you play with a faster vibrato…because the theremin really can be very pretty.
RR: So, it’s pretty, but can it go so far as to be romantic?
RS: Yes, I got a girl with the theremin.
RR: Wow!
RS: Yeah, I met this girl who was doing all these avant-garde plays, and this is when I had first seen a clip of someone playing the theremin. And I thought, “If I can play this instrument well, I bet she’s really going to like me.” So I learned to play it…. Look, lust and love are big motivators when it comes to—
RR: Playing the theremin?
RS: Anything! When doing anything!

Harvard students are known for being creative. Sure, they can craft resumes that resemble works of art, write Pulitzer-worthy papers on books they've never read, and spin epic tales about their accomplishments during job interviews at McKinsey. But how creative are they on the one holiday where it really matters the most: Halloween? To solve this great mystery last Friday, Flyby scoped out the costume scene on campus to bring you some of the most creative, the weirdest and the most Harvard relevant costumes of the crop. Maybe you can use them for Heaven & Hell too.
Dionysus
Enveloped by a cloud of perfume and a shower of glitter that can be seen from a mile away, the ever-alluring Tyler Frances '18 bravely struts into the October night wearing golden short shorts and not much else. When asked about his costume, he explained that he is "Dionysus, the god of ecstatic possession!"—a fitting choice for a weekend of bacchanalian revelry.
K-Pop Girl Band
After Gangnam Style swept us all off our feet in 2012, a new wave of K-Pop fever is descending upon campus this Halloweekend. "According to 2NE1, WE ARE THE BEST!" exclaims Claudia Laurie '18, apparently in reference to the some female K-Pop band the trio is imitating.
The Donald
An orange-toupéd force of nature, Trey Sexton '19 sweeps into the party with a celebrity scowl, a foul mood, and a handful of thousand dollar bills peeking out of his suit. Maybe he wasn’t embarrassed enough by the prank that was pulled by the semi-secret Sorrento Square organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
The Honor Code
One costumed student seemed to radiate with unadulterated purity and academic integrity this Halloween. "I thought it'd be fun to dress up as [the honor code], especially because it had been had so overemphasized on campus," explained Grace C. Ramsey '19.
Glow-in-the-Dark Stick Figures
A creative take on a children's costume idea, Saskia M. Keller '18 and Rebecca L. Gracias '18 stole the spotlight as colorful dancing stick people. One of the perks of glowing in the dark? According to Gracias, "We never had to worry about getting lost in the crowd because Saskia and I could see each other from a mile away."
Rakesh & Stephanie Khurana
If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the Khuranas certainly have loyal fans! Siddharth Yarlagadda '18 and Sali E. Yi '18 are dressed as Rakesh and Stephanie— the well-loved Dean of Harvard College and his wife and Co-House Master at Cabot House, respectively. Talk about a power couple! (Maybe Siddharth has a fake Vespa too?)
Netflix and Chill
Popularized by internet memes everywhere, this classic euphemism for college hookups is now available in costume form! After best friends Maddie Sewani '16, an inactive Crimson editor, and Grace E. Dhanraj '16 indulged in a series of post-work Netflix marathons this past summer, they were surprised to learn that "Netflix and chill" was actually a double-entendre (!!!), sparking a hilarious idea for their joint Halloween costume.
Smiley
If Smiley was sitting in your LS1a lecture, you probably have bigger problems to worry about than your pre-med GPA. Introducing the creative brainchild of Elaine Dong '17, a VES concentrator who took three hours to assemble her homemade costume. "I just wanted to do something creepy," says Dong. "I wanted to make people pee in their pants."
