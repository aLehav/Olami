It’s a little after midnight on Friday and I’m squeezed onto a couch at Sigma Chi beside two visiting brothers from another university. Both are are wearing nearly identical pastel uniforms: button-downs with the sleeves rolled up, matching backwards baseball caps, sagging khakis, boat shoes. Clutching cans of Coors Light, they communicate largely in unintelligible grunts shouted over the din of what Might have seemed to them to be a tame iteration of a frat party.
“You do not look drunk enough, my man,” one tells a Harvard attendee.
“Let’s get you some beers—you wanna shotgun?” says the other visiting brother. “No pressure!” he adds.
The first brother knocks back his beer can while pumping his fist into the air. He yells something, but it gets drowned out by the chorus of Ne-Yo’s “Give Me Everything.”
“Where are you gonna sleep tonight, anyway?” someone asks the visitor.
“It’s college, dude! You sleep where you can!” he replies, speaking as if he has just granted everyone around him access to some hidden piece of wisdom. These visiting brothers seem like broadly rendered parodies of frat boys, spouting lines from TV shows. By comparison, the Harvard brothers are bizarrely subdued, standing around complaining about TFs and midterm grades.
Down in the Sigma Chi basement, three girls cluster around the bar, shoulder to shoulder to shoulder, each trying to get the attention of the bartender. Around them, the other party goers dance waving their half-empty cups in the air like props. The scene is nearly interchangeable with any other mildly crowded college dance party and populated with all of the usual suspects: pockets of girls dancing together in circles, couples joined at the groin, pale-faced freshman boys on the prowl, a guy I sat next to in lecture once.
Back upstairs, two guys are slumped on top of a pile of discarded pea coats in the midst of a hazy argument about relationships at Harvard.
“Everyone is just trapped in limbo, you know?” says one.
“That’s not true,” his friend insists.
“You just got to get yourself out of there.”
A group of girls interrupts the conversation in order to extricate their coats.
What were we saying?”
“What were we saying?”
“Limbo?”
“Limbo…yeah.”
Their conversation dies out and one guy goes to rejoin the dancers downstairs, leaving the other to sit in silence with his beer.
SATURDAY NIGHT
Saturday night brings with it another chance to experience the Harvard party scene this time at a dining hall dance party in Winthrop. The theme: “Keep it Classy.” The tagline: “What will you be? Trashy or Classy?” By midnight, the beats of “Born This Way” are audible from Plympton Street and a line fills the vestibule in front of the dining hall. A pair of tall, narrow dance cages are the centerpiece of this “Classy” party, and, as promised in the invitation, there are laser lights. The magenta beams cast magnified shadows of chandeliers on the ceiling overhead, creating a strange visual rhyme with the bars of the dance cages below.
Students shimmy in and out of the cages in rapid cycles, climbing up the metal bars and gyrating towards the ceiling. Party goers throng around the cage dancers, whooping and hollering and singing along to Top 40 hits. The dancers in the cages seem, for a few moments, transported. Instead of worrying about their tutors standing on the opposite side of the room, or the likelihood of someone from their English section looking on from the sidelines, they abandon all pretensions of class. Thighs flex, shoulders shake, heads roll back and forth. Students tumble in and out of the cages with each new song in a swift exchange that seems not to need coordination. Each time I look, new bodies are twisting and reaching, hands clutched tight around the bars encircling them.
Students yelp “I said look to you need to crawl ’fore you ball/ Come and meet me in the bathroom stall,” bodies writhe in cages, couples press up against dark wood panelling with sweat-shiny faces and a HUPD officer stands with her arms crossed by the door. The officer seems unfazed by the scene unfolding in front of her. As college parties go, this is all just good clean fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following its upset over No. 10 Cornell, the Harvard men’s hockey (4-3-0, 3-3-0 ECAC) team suffered a letdown the next evening, falling to Colgate, 1-0, Saturday night at Starr Arena in Hamilton, N.Y.
The Raiders struck early and neither team was able to generate much offensive momentum thereafter, as Colgate (6-6-1, 2-3-1 ECAC) improved to .500 on the season after defeating Dartmouth the previous night.
“We didn’t really show up, to be honest,” junior goalie Raphael Girard said. “It was a tough game; we had a couple of guys playing well, but to win, we have to have all 20 guys on the team pulling in the same direction. What we brought to Cornell, we didn’t bring to Colgate.”
The lone goal of the contest was scored by Raider junior defenseman Jeremy Price, who put it past Girard with 6:45 remaining in the first period.
“[Colgate] had some good defensemen that could shoot the puck pretty well, and all night long they were looking for that,” Girard said. “I can’t stop what I can’t see, and they had a couple screens in front of me, and they scored top glove.”
Overall in the first period, the Crimson recorded nine shots on goal to Colgate’s seven. Freshman goaltender Spencer Finney was solid in net, stopping all 25 shots he ultimately faced.
Each team was called for a five-minute major penalty in the second period, though no goals were produced from the man-advantage opportunities.
“We are short bodies right now—we have at least three injuries...so some of the guys that normally would have killed penalties aren’t in the lineup,” sophomore forward Mike Seward said. “We’re basically using everyone we can killing penalties, so it just sort of disrupts our rhythm a bit.... It kind of tires out some of the guys who have to kill the penalties.”
Harvard junior defenseman Dan Fick was assessed the penalty just 2:14 into the second, but the strong Crimson penalty kill was able to keep the Raiders at bay. Near the end of the period, junior forward Mike McCann was penalized for contact to the head against sophomore Tommy O’Regan of Harvard.
Colgate has been highly penalized all season, entering the weekend with the ninth most penalties minutes per game in the nation with 15.9. On Saturday, the Raiders racked up 19 penalty minutes on four infractions.
But the Crimson was unable to capitalize on its chances during the extended power play, which continued into the third period. Throughout the game Harvard was zero for three on the man-advantage.
“We just [were] maybe looking to make some dangles at the blue line which we are not supposed to instead of getting the puck deep,” Girard said. “A good fore-check would give us some momentum which we had sometimes but not that [much] against Colgate.”
With another power play in the third period and an extra man in the final minute with Girard taken off the ice, the Crimson failed to make the most of man-up opportunities, which the team relied on heavily last season.
“As of right now, [the power play] may be our Achilles heel,” Girard said. “But we have been working on it, and I know the guys are really talented and we are going to figure it out.”
Overall this season Harvard is 2 for 26 on the power play for a conversion rate of 7.7 percent, much lower than the nation-leading 27.3 percent of last year.
“We have four of the five back this year from last year’s power play,” Seward said. “So it’s kind of a mystery why we’re struggling with the power play so much this year. [It’s] something we’re working on and looking to improve.”
With several near-misses during the night, the Crimson outshot Colgate, 25-22, despite losing the faceoff battle, 33-23. Girard finished with 21 saves, and captain Danny Biega led the team with four shots against the Raiders.
Girard attributes the loss to the team’s straying away from the original game plan for the contest.
“Every game we go in there and we know what we have to do,” he said. “If we follow our game plan, we know it’s going to pay off at the end of the game and I don’t think we were committed enough at Colgate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard community celebrated the football team’s win over rival Yale, the men’s water polo team took on a different rival, beating out third-seeded MIT, 10-7, in its final game of the season at the Collegiate Water Polo Association Eastern Division Championships on Sunday.
The Crimson (15-19, 4-2 CWPA) beat the Engineers (11-14, 2-4) in its final game of the season after consecutive losses to No. 1-seed Bucknell (17-13, 3-5) and No. 2-seed Brown (28-4, 5-0) on Friday and Saturday in the tournament.
It was Harvard’s second consecutive trip to the Eastern Division Championships and second seventh-place finish in two seasons.
“Coming into the weekend, we believed that we had a shot to win the tournament and go on to NCAAs, but we weren’t overly confident,” senior attacker Antone Martinho said.
According to its players, the Crimson played its best matches all year against the Bison and the Bears, although the team couldn’t find a way to win. Harvard came into the weekend with four injured players, and lost two more to injury against Brown.
Next year, the Crimson will see most players return, losing only Martinho and 2-meter Max Eliot.
“I was very happy ending the season on a win,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “It’s a good way to springboard into next year. We are very excited about the future here.”
HARVARD 10, MIT 7
The Crimson went down, 3-1, in the first quarter but rallied to tie up the game going into the fourth. Sophomore 2-meter John Holland-McCowan scored four goals—three in the fourth quarter—to seal the only victory of the weekend.
“Overall, I’m very happy with the way the guys responded,” Minnis said. “It’s easy to come into the game for seventh place and just not play and go through the motions.”
The Crimson’s defense was anchored by freshman goalkeeper Colin Woolway, who made 13 saves to back up three steals apiece by freshman 2-meter Ben Zepfel and freshman attacker Noah Harrison.
“He made some key blocks in the fourth quarter, and when your goalie makes a big save it feeds everyone else on the defensive end,” Minnis said.
Harvard went 2-2 against the Engineers this season, its most recent encounter ending in a 15-14 sudden-death overtime loss at the Northern Division Championships.
Despite being unable to advance in the tournament, Harvard players say they found some consolation in ending the season on a win.
“MIT is our biggest rival game,” Martinho said. “We go back and forth and no one team wins too many games in a row. We were really pleased to come back with a good, solid win against them.”
BROWN 16, HARVARD 11
The Crimson took an early lead in the first quarter against Ivy rival Brown, but it couldn’t hold on in the second half after the Bears jumped ahead.
It was Harvard’s third straight loss to Brown this season.
“We came out really strong, and even though we didn’t win, we played with them much better this time,” Martinho said.
Harvard was hard pressed to contain a powerful Bears offense, including four-time Northern Division Player of the Year Svetozar Stefanovic.
“[The Bears] are a very talented team, and they have one of the best players in water polo in Stefanovic,” Minnis said.
Despite losing two players to injury, the Crimson benefited from its strong freshman class, who scored all 11 of the team’s goals. Zepfel lead the team with five goals, and Harrison was close behind with four.
BUCKNELL 15, HARVARD 13
Bucknell came out firing against Harvard, racking up a 4-0 lead to start the game. But the Crimson pushed back, scoring four before the end of the period, while the Bison netted two more.
Harvard’s only lead of the night came at the end of the third quarter, when the team went up, 11-9. But Bucknell netted three straight to take a one-goal lead going in to the fourth quarter.
To open the fourth, Holland-McCowan scored his second goal of the night, tying up the score. Harvard held on to the tie for the rest of the period, but with under one minute remaining, the Bison scored two straight to cement their win and advance to the semifinal round for the first time since 2010.
“[Bucknell has] been doing a really good job with their zone defense, so we were trying to exploit some of the holes in that defense by hitting the gap and trying to get better shot selection,” Minnis said.
Harvard’s offense centered on Harrison, who scored a game-high five goals. The Crimson benefited from a balanced attack, with goals coming from seven different players.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 140th meeting between the two teams, the Harvard men’s hockey team  defeated Cornell, 4-1, at Lynah Rink to secure its first win of the season against a team ranked in the top 25. Cornell, which came into the game ranked No. 10 in the nation, outshot the No. 17 Crimson, 35-16, but had only five shots on goal during its four power-play opportunities in the first two periods.
Harvard (4-3-0, 3-3-0 ECAC) scored two goals in the first period and tacked on insurance goals in the second and third—the final an empty-netter—to seal the victory. The Crimson victory represented the second consecutive win in the series against Cornell (3-3-2, 1-3-2). Junior goaltender Raphael Girard had 34 saves and Harvard blocked 23 shots in the contest.
READY WITH THE RESPONSE
In a first-period scoring flurry, the teams netted three goals in a 58-second burst 15 minutes into the game. The Crimson began the scoring with a goal by senior forward Alex Fallstrom. After a shot ricocheted off of Big Red goalkeeper Andy Iles’ foot, Fallstrom sailed in and poked the puck into the back of the net to give Harvard a 1-0 lead with five minutes remaining in the first period.
A quick goal by Cornell forward John Knisley, who drove down the rink and quickly put a slap shot from 30 yards out past Girard, tied the game up at one.
But Harvard was quick with the response. After cradling the puck and patiently waiting behind the Cornell goal for an opportunity, sophomore forward Tommy O’Regan skated right and evaded a Big Red defender to put a pass directly on the stick of sophomore forward Mike Seward, who in one motion hit the puck past Iles and gave the Crimson a 2-1 lead they would not relinquish.
“[In] the first 15 minutes, there weren’t any goals. It was a really tight hockey game,” Seward said. “At Cornell, there are so many fans, and the energy of the game is so high, goals like [the second goal] are big for momentum, so it was important that we scored right after Cornell scored to silence the crowd.”
OLD FOES, NEW MEMORIES
The rivalry between the Crimson and the Big Red dates back to 1910. Cornell holds a 71-61-8 edge in the rivalry, but Harvard has won the last two and emphatically defeated the Big Red, 6-1, in the ECAC semifinals last year. Harvard has won three of the last four postseason meetings between the teams as well.
Before each game, fans at Lynah will throw dead fish onto the ice as the Crimson is introduced. Not to be outdone, Harvard fans throw dead chickens at Big Red players when they visit Cambridge in one of the more notable quirks of the rivalry.
“It was a great atmosphere [at Cornell],” Girard said. “They obviously have some of the better fans in the country. It was a great time playing there.”
WINNING WITH DEFENSE
Although Harvard scored four goals, Seward said that the team won the game with its defense, forcing turnovers and getting into passing lanes to disrupt the Cornell attack. Although the Big Red mustered 18 more shots than Harvard, Cornell failed to get quality shots in the second and third periods, as the Crimson forced the Big Red attackers into long shot after long shot.
“We didn’t get nearly as many shots on net as Cornell,” Seward said, adding that defensively, the team “managed to have a lot of good stick play, [blocked] passes, [and] we got in shot lanes.”
Girard agreed with Seward, adding that he thought the team’s ability to turn defense to offense—as on the fourth goal of the game, where a Cornell turnover led to a Crimson breakaway and an empty-net goal—was crucial in building, and later extending, the Harvard lead.
“Against Cornell, we tracked back a lot, and then we created some turnovers which brought us some goals,” Girard said. “We got the puck really deep and had some really good forechecking against Cornell which allowed us to create some momentum.”

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
You won't need any forks or knives when you eat at Addis Red Sea, an Ethiopian restaurant near Porter Square. Instead of cutlery, Ethipian food calls for a different set of tools: namely, your hands. With the aid of lots and lots of injera, an Ethiopian bread that's like a spongier version of sourdough, you scoop up different entrees and channel the food directly to your mouth.
For those who have never tried Ethiopian food, the Addis Red Sea Special Combo ($28.95) offers samples of the top six most popular entrees. In addition to the platter of food, you're also brought a basket of injera.
The Gomen Wot, chopped collard greens drenched in herbed oil with onions, green peppers, and garlic, was cooked so thoroughly that it was really soft and tender. The seasoning for this dish was not too overpowering.
Doro Alcha, or chicken simmered in a mild sauce of butter, ginger, and onions, was suitable for those who don't like anything too spicy.
Doro Wot was perhaps the most complex dish in terms of its preparation. The tender chicken was first marinated in lemon, and then sautéed in seasoned butter. Finally, it was stewed in red pepper sauce that gave a tinge of spiciness.
Lega-Tibs, or beef chunks sautéed in oil and seasoned with onions, green peppers, rosemary, and black pepper, was so spicy that it called for a lot of water. Like, multiple refills. That would have been fine except that the beef was really tough, making the texture not worth the spiciness.
The entree also comes with Zenge, another spicy beef dish, and the Addis House Salad.
Addis Red Sea is perhaps not the best place for a first date since it can get messy. On the flip side, you definitely have an excuse for "accidently" brushing against your date's hand as you reach for that last bit of chicken.
