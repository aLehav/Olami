After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Crafting a student body means taking into account many different skills, and athletic recruitment forms a substantial part of the college admissions process. Here at Harvard, scouts recruit for a host of varsity sports, and colleges around the country compete fiercely for strong high school athletes. 
The problem: Recruiting may start far earlier than one might expect. According to a recently published article in the New York Times, many athletes get recruited as early as fifteen years old—counter to NCAA regulations—and some schools may recruit even younger athletes. Excessively early recruiting puts unnecessary pressure on students at a disturbingly young age, and needs to be stopped. 
 Early recruiting hurts student athletes by needlessly creating a high-pressure environment, rife with uncertainty and possible heartbreak. Recruiting often involves generous scholarships to highly valued colleges, so students recruited as early as thirteen years old can feel as if thousands of dollars—not to mention their educational opportunities—ride on their athletic performance. 
This trend is especially distressing since colleges are known to withhold athletic scholarships if the athlete in question can no longer play. By NCAA rules, scholarships can be renewed or withheld on an annual basis, and schools can choose not to renew them if circumstances change. The University of Mississippi revoked its scholarship to a high school football player in Georgia after he tore his ACL. A student allegedly had to leave the University of Missouri after the school chose not to renew his basketball scholarship due to an unimpressive season performance. 
The stakes are extremely high, and the process of early recruiting is thrusting those stakes on students too young to bear them. It seems bizarre to grant scholarships to thirteen-year-olds when so much can change in four or five years. Athletes could face permanent injury, or fall behind in athletic prowess, or simply decide they no longer want to play—all of these cases could be devastating for a young athlete facing the possible loss of a scholarship to a dream school, often worth thousands of dollars.
Harvard does not offer scholarships for any kind of skill, whether academic or athletic. This is good in part because it discourages the high-stakes practice of aggressive early recruiting.  Harvard of course still has its extensive financial aid program. We hope the spread of accessible higher education continues and helps to limit the pressure on students—especially those who can afford college today only with an athletic scholarship.
Recruiting can be a harmless or positive phenomenon. Good athletic teams add to school spirit, and athletic talent should be taken into account as much as any other extracurricular ability when making admissions decisions. But the process should be just as focused on student athletes’ mental and physical health as it is on building strong teams. Schools should resist the temptation to recruit at ever younger ages. For students as young as thirteen, the pressure is simply too high.

On the day after Christmas, while many people were cleaning up presents or sleeping off a hangover, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a trip to a shrine. This wasn’t just any religious place, but Yasukuni Shrine, a Shinto place of worship that houses, among others, several Class A war criminals from World War II. Abe’s visits to the shrine have long been condemned by both national and international media as an example of Japan’s historically unrepentant attitude toward the atrocities of World War II.
What makes Abe’s most recent visit unique is the fact that the Ambassador Caroline B. Kennedy ’80, newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Japan, issued a statement condemning the visit, stressing that “the United States is disappointed.” Personally, I agree with the U.S.—and with the 69 percent of Japanese who said Abe should have considered diplomatic relations—that Abe’s decision to visit Yasukuni shrine was rash and insensitive, given the current political climate in East Asia. Unlike Germany, the other major Axis power, Japan has not sincerely made an effort to apologize for its brutality during the war. Despite numerous apologies by the central government over the decades, Japanese politicians have been consistently insensitive to the countries harmed by the Japanese Imperial Army—one of the more recent examples being a Japanese mayor who referred to the wartime rapes of thousands of East Asian women as “necessary.” 
But while Abe’s actions were not optimal, the U.S. overstepped its bounds by issuing a reprimand for his conduct. Kennedy’s statement was especially impolitic in tone, treating a head of state as though he were a petulant child. 
At the simplest level, Yasukuni is a Shinto shrine, and therefore a place of worship for the Japanese indigenous religion. In addition to the war criminals who receive much of the publicity, the shrine also honors victims of major Japanese conflicts, including Okinawan school children who were killed during evacuation at the end of World War II. Although Abe, as a public figure, should be aware of the consequences of his actions, it is not the responsibility of a foreign nation to dictate which religious observances are acceptable for him to make. Abe was elected democratically, and if the Japanese voting public feels strongly enough about the negative impact his visits will have on their country and their relationships with the rest of East Asia, they have the right and ability to vote his party out of office. If we are to support democracy, we must accept that this ability justly rests in the hands of his constituents alone.
Certainly there are times when a country has a right to condemn the actions of another. A contemporary example would be the international censure of Putin’s government for its recent homophobic policies. The actions of Abe are fundamentally different from the anti-homosexual “propaganda” law that passed through Russia’s parliament this year. The harassment of the Russian LGBT community that followed the passage of the law is detrimental to basic notions of individual autonomy and rights. Whatever the political consequences of Abe’s visit, and however nationalistic Abe’s personal politics may be, the Yasukuni visit itself is has not harmed anyone or infringed upon basic rights.
Despite the way the country handled itself in international affairs during the past century, America is not an international manners police force. The ambassador—and the government, by extension—was presumptuous in her condemnation of Abe. The United States is hardly in a position to condemn the treatment of controversial politicians—just look at the ways in which it treats its own war criminals. Harry S. Truman, the president who deployed the atomic bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. The U.S. government under Barack Obama continues drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan with almost no accountability. Given its much more recent history with conflict, America is acting hypocritically. 
Some may justify America’s intervention as necessary given its role in East Asia. Currently, Japan relies on American military protection since Japan’s constitution only allows the country’s Self-Defense Forces to be deployed in a peacekeeping capacity. But especially given the resentment that many residents of Okinawa have toward the U.S. military encroachment (not to mention the rape committed by U.S. sailors, or the asbestos), this compromise (of sorts) seems past its expiration date. 
A recent New York Times article listed, among other red flags, Abe’s desire for a Japan “complete with a full-fledged military” as an indication of his crippling nationalism. This is rather rich coming from a paper based in a country that has spent over $700 billion on its military in each of the past three years. 
A private word of concern regarding the fallout of Abe’s visit would have been a much more appropriate step for Ambassador Kennedy to take. As it stands, Kennedy is perpetuating the American image of smug superiority that makes the country so irritating abroad. While the Japanese public ought to think carefully about the persona it wants to project to nations in the region—in the spirit of democratic thought, the ultimate decisions should be left to the Japanese people. 
So the U.S. is “disappointed” with Japan? Well, I’m disappointed with you, America.

The percentage of female protagonists in Harvard Business School case studies will double over the next five years, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria pledged at an event on Monday celebrating the 50th anniversary of women MBAs at the school.
Speaking at a “50 Years of Women at HBS” gala event hosted by the Harvard Business School Association of Northern California Monday evening in San Francisco, Nohria apologized for the school’s historical disrespect and negligence towards women, according to an article on the blog  Poets & Quants chronicling the event. In addition to pledging to augment female representation in case studies, he affirmed the Business School’s intent both to assist women in serving on boards of directors and to encourage networking between female alumnae and students.
"The school owed you better, and I promise it will be better," Nohria.
Fifty years after women were first admitted to the two-year MBA program, the Business School continues to face difficulties in retaining and attracting female professors, and many of its female students have fallen behind their male peers, the New York Times reported in September.
Currently, nine to 10 percent of case studies developed and disseminated by the Business School—which produces more than 80 percent of cases sold globally—feature women as protagonists. By contrast, 41 percent of the MBA Class of 2015 are women.
 
Carin-Isabel Knoop, executive director of the Case Research & Writing Group, an organization housed within the Business School which has consulted in the development of more than 840 case studies, said that cases tend to involve situations in which a decision maker is in a position to meaningfully affect his or her organization.
 
As a result, she said, the protagonists of case studies produced at the Business School have tended to come from the highest levels of management—positions that men more frequently hold than women. As of Jan. 2014, for example, only 23 companies within the Fortune 500 had female CEOs.
 
Recently, however, the number of female protagonists in cases consulted upon by Knoop’s research team has grown, she said, primarily as a result of a diversification of the type of case study the school produces.
 
“We have been writing more entrepreneurship cases and cases that use protagonists at different levels in the organization,” she said. “We have seen more and more women protagonists recently.”
 
But Reena A. Jadhav, a serial entrepreneur who graduated the Business School’s MBA program in 1998, said that the school still lags in drawing from its robust female alumnae network for its case studies. She cited a lack of outreach by faculty and researchers to female graduates like herself.
 
“When we talk about bringing in more female-centered cases,” said Jadhav, who has been involved in the founding of four startups since her departure from the Business School, “I think that it’s just a matter of reaching out to more HBS women that are out there—that are having these incredible experiences, but have not yet been contacted to get their stories into cases.”
 
While a goal of 20 percent representation may seem too low some—according the article in Poets & Quants, attendants of Monday’s event let out an audible sigh at Nohria’s promise, thinking it was not ambitious enough—the objective is laudable, Jadhav said.
 
“I’m a very firm believer in the butterfly effect,” she said. “I really believe that all of these little things will together add up to create a positive change for women at work. I think it needs to happen at every level, because nobody talks about this.”
 
In terms of the process of case study production, Knoop said, Nohria’s announcement might lead to more referrals both to and from female industry leaders interested in the case development process—and in sharing the hurdles and triumphs that they have faced in their careers.

Horizontal entryways, an art studio with a kiln, a “smart classroom,” and a new gym are among the features outlined in plans for the renewed Dunster House released Thursday, just a few months ahead of the project’s groundbreaking.
When construction begins in early June, Dunster will be the first House to undergo renovation to its entire building, seeing a transformation of its social, academic, and residential spaces. It follows more-limited test projects at Quincy and Leverett Houses, where Stone and McKinlock halls have served as models for the broader renewal of Harvard’s undergraduate residences.
It is unclear how closely the arrangement of private residences will resemble that of Stone Hall, which now features a mix of traditional suites with private common rooms and “cluster communities,” which are comprised of hall-single and double bedrooms with shared common rooms and hall bathrooms. Like Stone and McKinlock halls, Dunster is slated to feature horizontal corridors connecting its current vertical entryways.
The lower levels of the House, which currently house squash courts and other student spaces, will be redesigned to include new, repurposed student spaces, including a music practice room, a game room, and a large common room connected to the House grille. A seminar room and 80-person lounge on the first floor will connect to the courtyard.
 
In total, the project will create 33 percent more space for House programming, according to Merle Bicknell, assistant dean for physical resources within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“One of the great benefits of House renewal is that while we cannot change the footprint, we can reconfigure and reuse the space in very exciting ways. We will have a lot more common and classroom space and it will feel a lot more open,” Dunster House Co-Master Roger B. Porter said in the release.
 
In line with sustainable design incorporated into Stone Hall, the renewed Dunster will feature better-insulated walls and windows, as well as a water retention system, according to the press release.
 
In an email sent to undergraduates Thursday morning, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde introduced the new design plans and reiterated the major goals of the House renewal program.
 
“While each renewed House will boast similar amenities, a few themes run through the entire project,” Lassonde wrote in the email. “Each will be LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified; each will be fully accessible; and each will retain its historic character and traditions.”
 
Administrators first announced in July 2012 that Dunster would be the first House to undergo a complete renovation. In addition to the swing space that has housed Quincy and Leverett students during the two test projects, the former Inn at Harvard will house a number of displaced Dunster students, as well as a House dining hall and other shared facilities.
 
In the fall, the it was announced that Winthrop would be the next undergraduate House to undergo renovation in 2016-2017, following a year-long break in construction after Dunster’s projected completion by the fall of 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Backed by an eight-man band, influential jazzman Wynton Marsalis closed out his multi-year lecture-concert series on American jazz Thursday evening in Sanders Theatre with a trip to New Orleans, the genre’s birthplace.
The meditation on race, culture, and music was the last installment of six in the series, "Hidden in Plain View: Meanings in American Music,” that started more than two years ago, in the spring of 2011. An integral part of University President Drew G. Faust's efforts to promote the arts on campus, Marsalis has taken on various genres and mediums, including American dance and popular music, in subsequent lectures.
"He does a phenomenal job because as soon as he describes a setting and a story to you, and then he starts playing, you’re transported there," said Robiny R. Jamerson '17, who attended Thursday’s performance.
In particular, Marsalis used the evening to focus on New Orleans jazz from 1885 to 1910, describing the city in different ways throughout the night. At times, Marsalis referred to the Crescent City as "the jewel no European country wanted," "a gumbo of sensitivities," or "uncouth elegance...voodoo religion," depending on which facet of New Orleans life he was discussing.
As Faust said in her introduction, "if any one place is the home of jazz, it's New Orleans," and Marsalis referenced his birthplace and hometown throughout the night.
Marsalis traced New Orleans history through the numerous cultures and peoples that inhabited the city, noting how this cultural cross-pollination lead to an incredibly diverse music scene. Acting out the scene of a New Orleans fruit market or playing the same song in both creole and jazz styles, Marsalis gave a cultural ethnography of the music scene in New Orleans.
 
"It would be like going from a rap group to the New York philharmonic two blocks away," Marsalis said of the compact and diverse music culture in his hometown.
 
Throughout the evening, the award-winning trumpeter returned back to cornetist and band leader Charles J. “Buddy” Bolden, a man Marsalis said changed music across America.
 
"Great players all come from Bolden, and all reflect him in some way," Marsalis said. "He was known for playing loud, but he liked to say that he played quiet enough to hear the women dragging their feet across the floor."
 
New Orleans diverse culture has come at a historical cost, though, as Marsalis repeatedly noted. Outside of the Reconstruction Era, the city of music and dancing has also been home to a large black population oppressed by their white neighbors.
 
For Ella M. Duncan '17, the historical context was part of what made the evening so memorable.
 
"It's deeply moving because of the historical significance,” she said. “You can hear it in the music, the struggle, and cultural clashes."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 31, 2014, at 4:27 a.m.
Junior Kenyatta Smith, a center on the Harvard men’s basketball team, re-injured his foot earlier this week, Smith told The Crimson early Friday morning. According to a source close to the team, he will be out for the remainder of the season. Smith played an instrumental role in the team’s run to the third round of the NCAA Tournament last March.
The source was granted anonymity by The Crimson because that individual was not authorized to speak publicly about the team's internal affairs.
Smith first injured his right foot five days before the team’s season opener against Holy Cross on Nov. 10. On Monday, he said that it began as a stress reaction and became a hairline fracture because of possible overuse during the offseason.


Smith played his first minutes of the year against Dartmouth last Sunday in an 80-50 Crimson win, registering one missed field goal in two minutes. The following afternoon, the junior commented that, other than mild soreness, “everything felt fine.”
Less than five days later, that soreness apparently evolved into a more serious malady. With the news of his re-injury, the big man will have to delay his comeback.
Even Smith’s initial return, however, was pushed back, as the team’s cautiousness took precedence over its need for an inside presence.
“We wanted to make sure I didn’t come out too early,” Smith said on Monday. “I kept telling the doctors it felt good, but they would poke around and I would flinch and that meant I’d sit.”
Smith said that while he discussed the timeline for his injury with the medical staff upon first hurting his foot, he never discussed the process of a medical redshirt, a measure by which a player can recapture a year of athletic eligibility.
“I don’t know if I was so eager to take the rest of the year off, honestly,” Smith said earlier this week, before his news of his re-injury. “Before the season, we talked about the time frame and [returning this season] was always the goal. I didn’t want to completely count this year out.”
The setback falls on the eve of Harvard’s showdown at Lavietes Pavilion against Princeton and Penn. It was during this very same homestand one year ago that Smith established himself as one of the team’s most valuable players, registering 34 points, 16 rebounds, and 16 blocks over the course of the weekend, shooting at a 92 percent clip from the field.
 For the 2012-2013 season, Smith averaged 5.8 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks in just 14.5 minutes of action. He shot 57 percent from the floor and anchored the back line of the Crimson defense.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Jan. 31, 2013
A previous version of this article stated that Smith said that he would be out for the remainder of the 2013-2014 season. In fact, Smith did not comment on his status for the remainder of the season. While Smith told The Crimson that he had been re-injured, an unnamed source close to the team, but not Smith, said that the center would be out for the rest of the season.

Like father, like son. Late Thursday night, high school junior center Ryan Donato announced his commitment to play hockey for his father, Harvard men’s hockey coach Ted Donato. The highest ranked prep school player in New England, per the NHL Central Scouting’s Midterm Report, Ryan ranks 54th among all North American skaters.
 
“He expects himself to do great things every time he’s on the ice, that’s the sign of a great player,” Dexter head coach Dan Donato, Ryan’s uncle, told ESPNBoston. “I’ve been really fortunate to have coached three players that have gone on to the NHL, but in some ways, Ryan’s on another planet. I truly believe his best hockey is ahead of him.”
 
The senior Donato has coached at Harvard for the last 10 seasons after being part of the school’s final national championship team in 1989.

One year ago, the Harvard men’s basketball team (15-3, 2-0 Ivy) was scrambling to find its identity.
With senior Kyle Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry gone on a leave of absence, the Crimson’s lack of both depth and experience was evident during the nonconference season. Picked to finish second in the Ivy League coaches poll, Harvard had narrowly scraped by in wins against Dartmouth, Yale, Brown and Cornell before its first conference loss—a 15-point upset at Columbia. As the Crimson prepared to take on its most difficult weekend of the season—hosting Penn and Princeton at Lavietes—it was make-or-break for Harvard’s chance at the Ancient Eight crown.
Powered by the play of then-sophomore Kenyatta Smith, the Crimson swept both the Quakers and the Tigers with size and strength as an inside presence.Smith earned his first career double-double against Penn with 20 points and 10 blocks, and came back the next night with 14 points and six blocks against Princeton. The center went on to be an impact player for the team throughout the 2012-2013 season, with the homestand against Harvard’s southern foes as his breakout moment.
However, this season has been a different story for Smith. After being sidelined by an injury just five days before the start of the season, Smith sat out the first 17 games of this year’s campaign. Last Sunday at Dartmouth, Smith finally donned a uniform again, and played two minutes in which he missed his only shot from the field. Smith noted nothing but routine soreness after the game.
But the Crimson will have to contend against Penn and Princeton this year without the big man who drove the victories last season, as Smith will miss the rest of the season due to a re-injury he suffered this week in practice.
Welcoming Penn (4-11, 1-0) and Princeton (12-3, 0-1) to Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard will have a lot to prove. As the Ivy League season wound down last year, the Crimson went on the road and dropped back-to-back contests against Princeton and Penn. Though Harvard stayed in both games until the final seconds, the losses dropped the Crimson into second place in the conference, hurting the team’s chances to earn an NCAA Tournament bid. However, the Tigers went on to lose two in the final week of Ivy play, forfeiting the title.
Against both teams this weekend, Harvard will seek to control the three-point line against two balanced offenses. Princeton is led by senior guard T.J. Bray—who averages just over 17 points per game as one of six impact Tigers players shooting well above 35 percent from deep. Inside, senior forward Will Barrett anchors the Tiger attack, averaging nearly 12 points a game on 42 percent three-point shooting. Penn will look to sophomore guard Tony Hicks, who effectively shut down sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers in both of last season’s matchups, to carry the team. Hicks averages 15.5 points per game on 39 percent shooting from behind the arc.
“Overall we’ve been pretty solid, but [Princeton is] very, very good at shooting the three-point shot and it’s just a big part of their offense,” said Amaker, regarding the Tigers. “It’s clear that we have to defend the three-point line. ”
Last year’s leading duo of Saunders and Chambers has continued to make an impact, even with the return of Casey and Curry. The two guards lead Harvard in scoring with 15 and 11.5 points per game, respectively. However, with Casey and Curry back on the court, this weekend’s Crimson team will look markedly different than the squad that took the court in Harvard’s final road trip of the 2012-2013 season.
The weekend marks the beginning of Ivy League back-to-back play and the start of a four-game homestand for the Crimson.
“Our philosophy is that we try a lot of different things throughout the year so when it comes time to play a certain style of opponent and we don’t have a lot of prep time, we don’t need a lot of prep time,” Amaker said. “There will be a few things this week we will prepare for Penn, but we won’t talk about Penn or have anything to say about Penn until after Friday night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
As January comes to a close, the no. 3/5 Harvard women’s ice hockey team  (16-2-2, 12-2-1 ECAC) will face two familiar conference foes—the same pair the team played at the start of the regular season in October, defeating both handily. The team travels to Princeton (10-8-3, 6-6-2) and Quinnipiac (16-4-6, 7-3-4) in search of the same results it saw as it kicked off the 2013-2014 campaign.
The Tigers are up first for Harvard as the two teams face off Friday night at the Hobey Baker Rink. 
When these two Ancient Eight opponents took the ice on Oct. 26, the Crimson routed the Tigers by a final score of 4-0. A trio of Harvard skaters—forward Samantha Reber, defender Sarah Edney and forward Hillary Crowe—put Harvard on the scoreboard, with Crowe nabbing two goals.
Power plays were key in the early season matchup. Three of the Crimson’s four scores against Princeton came when the Tigers skated in a man-down situation. Special teams have been an area of strength thus far for Harvard, as it holds the top penalty kill percentage in the country and the 20th-ranked power play nationwide. 
“Our first thought when we get a penalty is the next two minutes, the two minutes of the penalty kill, just work very hard, keep the puck to the outside [and] minimize the amount of shots they take” sophomore forward Mary Parker said. “If they do take a shot [we want to] make sure our goalie sees it because we know if she sees a shot she’ll make the save.”
Alongside the defense, goaltenders sophomore Emerance Maschmeyer and freshman Brianna Laing have given the team good minutes in net. 
Laing earned her third shutout in four starts a week ago when the team faced Union. In its game against Rensselaer, Maschmeyer had 30 saves. The two combine for a .961 save percentage. For Laing, the game will be even more of a reunion, as he rookie will could find herself swatting away the slapshots of her sister, Tigers senior Denna Laing. 
Denna Laing leads her team with 17 points through 21 games, scoring nine goals and dishing eight assists thus far in the season. 
Following the game in New Jersey, Harvard heads to Connecticut to face No. 9 Quinnipiac, a team it defeated 4-2 in its first game of the season. All four goals came in the second period off of the sticks of Edney, Crowe, and sophomore forward Dylanne Crugnale, who found the back of the net twice in the game. Crowe has had a hot stick in the past few weeks, scoring five goals and contributing one assist in the four games, all Crimson victories. In her last game, Crowe had two scores in a 3-1 win against Rensselaer on Jan. 25. 
“We played a lot of tough teams in January and a lot of tight games and Hillary has come up big for us with some very timely goals,” coach Maura Crowell said. “She’s feeling good and it helps bring up the confidence in everybody around her.”
The Minnesota native was also responsible for the season’s first goal, which came against Quinnipiac off of a power play in the team’s first meeting on Oct. 25.
The Bobcats faced a tough opponent in No. 8 Robert Morris their last time out on the ice, losing 5-1 in their final non-ECAC opponent of the season. Senior Kelly Babstock has commanded the Bobcat attack this season, netting 15 goals and dishing 22 assists. 
“[They are] two huge conference games for us,” Crowell said. “Just like every other team, everybody’s better now, everybody’s more experienced, everybody’s been in a lot of different situations and I’m sure they’re battle tested and ready to go just like we are.”
Heading into the weekend, the team currently leads the ECAC standings with 25 points as it looks to extend its four-game win streak. That said, Harvard has played more conference games than all but one other team in the league. Clarkson is a close second with 22 points and Parker said the team is shooting for at least a win and a tie on the weekend. 
“Since the ECAC standings are so close together we’re trying to get four points each weekend,” Parker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When we last convened, dear Around the Ivies reader, the Ancient Eight was filled with high drama. Heading into the final weekend of conference play, Harvard and Princeton were jockeying for position atop the standings with a bid to the NCAA Tournament on the line. After the Crimson took care of business at home against Cornell and the Tigers laid an orange stripy egg all over the Providence floor, the title remained in Cambridge. 
Though the drama may not be as high yet in the early stages of this year’s Ivy season, the high quality of play in the Ancient Eight makes up for it. With a collection of on-the-rise programs as well as old standbys, the Ivy League can now count itself as a solidly mid-major conference. 
The first inkling that something was up came in November, when Columbia, of all teams, nearly upset then-No. 2 Michigan State in East Lansing, Mich. By December, the Ivy League had climbed up to 11th on Jeff Sagarin’s conference rankings, which rely only on game results and scores. For a time, there were even whispers on Twitter of a #2BidIvy—alluding to the possibility of an Ivy League team making the NCAA tournament with an at-large bid—though those have been mostly silenced after the Crimson suffered a couple of tough non-conference losses. 
How did we get here? Princeton has been a big reason. Expected to have a down year after the loss of Ivy League Player of the Year Ian Hummer, the Tigers have remained firmly in the championship conversation behind the stellar play of senior guard T.J. Bray. After plunging into a vat of toxic waste in the offseason, Bray emerged as a basketball-loving mutant, dominating smaller defenders with his now-radioactive 6’5”, 207-lb. frame. Bray has nearly doubled both his scoring and assist averages from last year and turned himself into the frontrunner for conference MVP in the process.
And, hey, is that Columbia being competitive? Why, it is! Opponents can no longer wipe their feet on the perennial doormat Lions, who boast the conference’s third-best record, led by the sharpshooting duo of sophomore guard Maodo Lo and junior forward Alex Rosenberg—both better than 51 percent from three. Brown, Yale, and Dartmouth wrap up a very respectable middle of the conference, with Penn a bit of a disappointment at 4-11—though, with a home win over Princeton last week, the Quakers proved they are still dangerous. 
But Harvard remains the class of the Ivies at 15-3, the No. 43 team nationally in Ken Pomeroy’s data-driven rankings. Co-captain Brandyn Curry and senior forward Kyle Casey have been integrated into the team with little trouble, while sophomore Siyani Chambers and junior Wesley Saunders continue to shine. If all shakes out as expected, the Crimson will be heading back to the NCAA Tournament, likely as a 10 to 12 seed.
The only factor that has threatened to derail the league’s momentum thus far is injuries. After a promising start of the season, Dartmouth lost its best player, junior forward Gabas Maldunas, to a torn ACL in January. Harvard was missing key contributors for high-profile non-conference matchups against Colorado and Connecticut, and Bray did not play for Princeton in a close loss against Butler. With a little more luck, the Ivy League—which currently sits at 17th in Sagarin’s conference rankings—could be in an even stronger position. But the Ancient Eight has already proven itself to be nationally competitive, which is more than could be said in many years past. On to the games!
CORNELL V. BROWN
After all those kind words about the Ivy League, it’s time to deliver some not-so-kind ones because Cornell has managed to discover, capture, and mass produce the essence of suck. The Big Red is currently 1-15 (!!!) on the season; its first win didn’t come until January 11 against Division III Oberlin College. That’s right—the program that four years ago made the Sweet Sixteen does not have a Division I win in late January. 
Want some more misery? When I opened the team statistics page on Cornell’s website to dig a little deeper, I found a giant “:(”. Opponents are outscoring the Big Red by 14.7 points per game. Ken Pomeroy’s rankings put them at 345th out of 351 teams. Tough.
How did this happen? Cornell was at least halfway decent last season, finishing at 13-18. Before this year, there were complimentary murmurs circulating about sophomore guard Nolan Cressler. They even had a returning All-Ivy first-teamer in junior forward Shonn Miller. 
But in late October, it surfaced that Miller would likely miss the entire 2013-2014 season with a shoulder injury. Fifth-year senior Errick Peck, Cornell’s other All-Ivy performer from last season, transferred to Purdue to play out his redshirt year of eligibility, which the Ivy League does not honor. Things should get better for the Big Red as the team’s young core improves in the coming years, but boy, let’s shield the children’s eyes for now. 
Pick: Brown
COLUMBIA V. YALE
This weekend would go a long way toward proving Columbia means to be taken seriously. For the first time in a long time, the Lions are dealing with “expectations,” a word that had to be explained carefully to members of the Columbia athletic department. I say keep it up, you Lions!
Pick: Columbia
PRINCETON V. HARVARD
Ivy League play is not messing around, giving us one of the biggest matchups of the season on the first Friday of the conference season. If the Tigers can’t pull off the upset, the title race is close to over. That sounds strange to say after less than 25 percent of the conference season, but it’s realistic with such a gap between the top two and the rest of the league. A two-game deficit may be too much for Princeton to overcome, even if it returns the favor to the Crimson at Jadwin Gymnasium. The @ivybball Twitter account, which posts projections of the Ivy season, gives the Tigers 14 percent odds of earning a share of the title going into Friday, but those odds fall below seven percent if both Penn and Princeton fall to Harvard this weekend.
You have to hand it to Princeton—no one plays the villain better. I’m almost glad Bray stepped in so smoothly to fill the role of menacing aggressor vacated by Ian Hummer (who just signed a contract to play in Germany, which is perfect). But Bray seems a little too friendly to totally pull it off. Seriously, check him out. I want to ask that guy about his Lego collection, not boo him off a basketball court.
Pick: Harvard
PENN V. DARTMOUTH
It can’t be easy to already be mired in what I term “the Slog”—the monotony of playing out one’s conference schedule knowing one hasn’t a prayer of making it to the postseason. I’m not putting Penn in Slog territory, but I’m afraid, in your weakened condition, you’re already there, Dartmouth. Get your rain boots on, Big Green. It’s going to be a long six weeks of Sloggin’. 
Pick: Penn
COLUMBIA V. BROWN
Brown senior guard Sean McGonagill, the Ivy League’s current leading scorer, tallied his career high against Columbia his freshman year with 39 points on 15-of-19 shooting from the field. This came two days after a collision in practice earned him 20 stitches and knocked three of his teeth out. Presumably, his disfigured mug made the Lions’ defenders a little hesitant to get too close, allowing him consistently open looks.
Last year’s matchup in Providence was a wild affair featuring three lead changes in the final 68 seconds. Brown managed to pull out a three-point victory despite McGonagill scoring only four points. No word yet on whether McGonagill will mash in his face with a waffle iron to rekindle the magic.
Pick: Brown
CORNELL V. YALE
To be honest, I’m pretty bummed out thinking about Cornell again. If the conference was a group of cars, this year’s Cornell team would be the white unmarked van: nothing good can come from looking too closely, and it’s all-too-present in Ithaca.
Pick: Yale
PRINCETON V. DARTMOUTH
As I’ve alluded to, Princeton cannot afford any more slipups if it means to contend for the Ivy title. Luckily for the Tigers, Dartmouth looks to have pretty much fallen apart after the loss of Maldunas. The Big Green faithful can only hope this year’s setback does not negate a potentially promising future.
Pick: Princeton
PENN V. HARVARD
Harvard’s ugly, brick-laying loss last week to Florida Atlantic raised some questions (“Should we shoot the ball with our feet or our hands?”), but those were mostly answered when Harvard shot 66 percent from the field and beat Dartmouth on the road, 80-50. Facing a hobbled Penn at home should not present too many challenges. Expect the Crimson to coast to victory.
Pick: Harvard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No matter their allegiance, fans of Ivy League basketball had to savor Friday night’s matchup between the Harvard and Princeton men’s basketball teams at Lavietes Pavilion. The conference’s two best squads delivered a game worthy of its billing—an up-tempo, well-played, and highly competitive contest that saw the Crimson solidify its spot at the top of the Ancient Eights standings with an 82-76 victory.
Both teams looked comfortable on the court, shooting over 50 percent and effectively executing their competing styles of play—Princeton (12-5, 0-3 Ivy) with lots of screens, cuts, and three-point shots, and Harvard (17-3, 4-0) relying on its skilled individual playmakers to create opportunities. The two squads seemed to know exactly what was coming from the opposition; it was just a question of what they could do to prevent it.
“We prepared the same way [as usual],” co-captain Laurent Rivard said. “We know a little bit of what [the Tigers] run. The coaches did some scouting, they showed us a little bit, but we tried to stay true to our identity and our defense.”
Playing in front of a sellout crowd, the Tigers looked rattled by the atmosphere early on, committing six turnovers in the first seven minutes. When they did get a look at the basket, however, they capitalized at a high rate, particularly through sophomore forward Hans Brase, who scored 17 of Princeton’s first 21 points and 18 overall in the opening period. The Tigers finished the half shooting at a 60.9 percent clip from the field, and trailed the Crimson by one at the break.
But Harvard began to extend its advantage early in the second half behind the hot shooting of Rivard. The Crimson’s all-time three-point shooting leader connected on three three-pointers in a five-minute span to help key a 21-6 run that stretched the lead to as many as 15. Rivard finished the game with five threes and a season-high 18 points.
“There was a bunch of possessions where we were up and down,” Rivard said. “Everyone was getting a little tired, so you just try to keep pushing and find the spot.”
Princeton whittled away at the Harvard lead to make for a nervy finish, compounded by the Crimson’s struggles at the free-throw line. Harvard missed six free throws in the final 2:11, which allowed the Tigers to get within four with 59 seconds to play. But the Crimson did enough at the line and on defense—Princeton would get no closer down the stretch, and Harvard comfortably played out the game’s final moments.
The matchup between arguably the two best players in the conference—Princeton’s T.J. Bray and Harvard’s Wesley Saunders—was essentially a stalemate, as both players filled up the stat sheets with excellent performances for their teams.
Saunders carried the load on offense for the Crimson with 24 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists, while Bray countered with 26 points, six rebounds, and six assists, though he did not attempt his first shot until 11 minutes had elapsed in the first half. The two did their damage efficiently, posting identical 9-for-13 lines from the field. For much of the game, Saunders took the defensive assignment on Bray.
“That’s what [Saunders] can do,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It doesn’t surprise us. Most of you who have seen us play and covered us, you know he’s capable of that kind of performance. You look around, and these are his kind of numbers.”
With the Crimson’s win and the losses by Columbia and Penn, Harvard remains the only team undefeated in Ivy League play. Princeton now falls two games behind the Crimson in the loss column after suffering a road defeat to Penn last week.
Forwards Jonah Travis and Agunwa Okolie were both inactive for the game—Travis with a concussion and Okolie with a knee injury. Amaker said that the two were out “indefinitely.”
