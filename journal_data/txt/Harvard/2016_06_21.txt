After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a hiatus at the end of the 2014-15 academic year, the return of the Patient Satisfaction Survey for Counseling and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) users this past semester offered a hopeful sign that a recent op-ed urging CAMHS to solicit feedback from students immediately following each visit may have reached its administrators. And yet, despite this sign of progress, the emailed survey has yet to ask CAMHS end users—students—for feedback promptly and courageously.
Embedding a procedure to solicit feedback from students immediately following each CAMHS visit remains the most insightful and courageous way for UHS to assess the effectiveness of its mental health care services.  The assumption that underpins the case for a prompt, onsite, post-visit questionnaire for CAMHS users is simple: students are serious thinkers. If CAMHS dares to see us as such and ask us how—not merely whether—it provided care and how it can see us more fully, it can tap into a trove of insightful feedback.
Insightful feedback requires courageous questions. The patient satisfaction survey did little, if anything, to ask students whether and—if not—how CAMHS providers failed to see us in the fullness of our life experiences when we came in for a counseling session. And if the timing and the substance of the survey are any indication, one cannot help but wonder how willing CAMHS is to ask students how it can provide care in more relevant and empowering ways.
CAMHS emailed its survey along with the deluge of evaluation requests—including Q scores about classroom experiences—that flood students’ mailboxes amidst the crush of Reading Period. Albeit understandable, this administrative decision does not seem sound or courageous. Classrooms and counselors’ offices are decidedly distinct spaces. And the dimensions of students’ experiences upon which they touch are decidedly distinct matters.
The survey’s timing is not the only problem. Its use of language is equally problematic. The phrasing of the survey’s questions is overwhelmingly in the yes or no form. Closed-ended questions tend to foreclose opportunities to hear more stories and collect more data. The survey is not immune to those cognitive and conversational consequences of yes or no questions. Indeed, many of the survey’s questions fail to incorporate follow-up questions that might have enabled courageous inquiry and provided insightful feedback for CAMHS.
One way to sustain courageous inquiry in the survey is to design questions according to the principle of segmentation. Our increasingly diverse student body confronts CAMHS with an increasing multiplicity of stories, needs, and possibilities. If CAMHS is to remain responsive to the multitudes we contain, it needs to ask follow-up questions that assess the effectiveness of its services according to the multiple segments in the student population.
Under the framework of segmentation, each survey question would come with follow-up and—this is key—segmented questions that elicit further, case-specific reflections and demographic data points from students. Here is a concrete application: A student who answers “No” when asked whether they felt like they had had a sufficient number of sessions to address their primary concern would be asked two follow-up, segmented questions offering a range of additional sessions and asking for their demographic information. Without questions that segment results by students’ years, schools, and demographics, CAMHS might find, for instance, that 70 percent of students said the current baseline number of sessions sufficed to solve their primary concern and fail to see disparities in satisfaction rates among different segments of students.
Demographic factors such as gender, nativity, ethnicity, and socioeconomic insecurity do affect the likelihood of student engagement with mental health care services. Pretending that they don’t by denying them language and place in the patient satisfaction survey will not make their embodied affect go away. The value of follow-up, segmented questions resides in the capacity they can give CAMHS to map and ultimately monitor the impact of demographic factors on the relevance of care services. The resulting map may bring up troubling and difficult results, but detecting difficulties is key to making progress. In fact, difficult discoveries based on students’ stories can strengthen CAMHS’s capacity to see how some of its current practices may keep its care providers from seeing students where they are.
It is possible both to appreciate how well University Health Services is already doing many things and to continue to highlight how it can do these—and more—things better. The return of the CAMHS patient satisfaction survey this year was a good thing. And its timing and language could have still been better and more courageous. The survey’s use of language did not enable students to reflect courageously upon their experiences at CAMHS. Nor did it ask students questions that might invite CAMHS providers to confront ongoing ways in which the tone and touch of its procedures may fail to affirm the dignity of every student and make them feel invisible.
Improving the survey requires having the courage to see and equip the multitudes we embody to embrace the multiple forms of growth it takes to get through this thing called life in the 21st century. Courageous questions ask how—and whose lives—CAMHS providers are not yet equipped to see and comprehend in the fullness of their complexities and possibilities. Many students and young alumni encounter the lifelong importance of seeing and being seen during their experiences with CAMHS. Many more may if CAMHS begins to muster the courage to ask students “How didn’t we see you?” with the help of follow-up, segmented questions promptly and systematically. This year’s patient satisfaction survey does not contain any such questions. Future surveys do not have to be like this year’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 22, 2016, at 6:42 p.m.
Financier and first-generation alumnus Timothy R. Barakett ’87 and his wife Michele Barakett donated $25 million to the University to bolster its financial aid program and fund its varsity hockey program.
Barakett, who attended the College and was a beneficiary of the financial aid program, now serves as a co-chairman of both the Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences and the Financial Aid portion of that campaign.
Barakett’s donation endows Harvard’s new “start up” grants—$2,000 stipends that the College will provide starting next fall for students from low-income backgrounds in addition to their existing financial aid package. The program is designed to reduce the burden of textbook purchases and other expenses for incoming students.
Barakett’s gift will also endow a new, unrestricted scholarship fund, adding to the over 1,500 individual endowments that make up Harvard’s financial aid program. In recent years, Harvard has made significant steps to expand the scope of its aid with the goal of eliminating the need for students to take out loans while attending the school. Still, 24 percent of graduating seniors in 2015 reported taking out loans with a median total amount of $10,900.
Barakett’s donation marks yet another multi-million dollar gift Harvard has reeled in during its historic capital campaign, which surpassed its $6.5 billion goal in May. The financial aid office received a $125 million dollar gift from hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 in 2014, which resulted in the office being renamed in his honor.
Barakett emphasized that supporting the financial aid pays dividends in the long run.
“A gift to financial aid has a greater impact than just four years of college for these students,” Barakett said in a press release. “We want to help empower them to create their best Harvard experience, and never to feel they are on the periphery.”
Barakett also donated $1 million to the College’s varsity hockey program. During his time as an undergraduate at Harvard, Barakett and a teammate earned the nicknames “Killer B” for their performance on the ice.
Barakett and his wife are the founders of a private family foundation that provides funds to Harvard and the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University, among other organizations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 22, 2016, at 3:30 p.m.
Nearly three months after former Harvard Hockey star Jimmy Vesey informed the Nashville Predators that he would be testing NHL free agency this summer, the club officially cut ties with the 2016 Hobey Baker Award winner Monday afternoon.
Four days ahead of the NHL Entry Draft, the Predators agreed to ship Vesey’s negotiation rights to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for a third-round selection, No. 76 overall. The Sabres now have until Aug. 15 to ink Vesey to a contract before he can become an unrestricted free agent.
Vesey made his fair share of headlines while donning crimson, becoming a two-time Ivy League and ECAC Player of the Year with 104 points in 70 games over his final two seasons in Cambridge. But he’s made plenty more in recent months for the decision Nashville general manager David Poile called “a shocker” back in March.
At that impromptu press conference in Nashville inside Bridgestone Arena, Poile said he would try to persuade Vesey to change his mind. But that task quickly proved fruitless. A few days after Poile made his remarks, Vesey’s camp released a statement challenging several of the general manager's contentions, and less than a week later, Vesey did not appear to mince words when he said there were “29 teams” he could look at when the time came to determine a landing spot.
"It's been pretty clear since late March that we're not going to be able to sign Jimmy Vesey," Poile told The Tennessean on Monday. “By trading him today, in my opinion, we recouped the [third-round] pick we used to acquire him.”
Meanwhile, Buffalo still has three third-round picks in this year’s draft, making the gamble all the more worth the while for Sabres general manager Tim Murray. After all, landing Vesey would mean uniting this year’s Hobey Baker Award winner with last’s, as Jack Eichel—a former Boston University star and a friend of Vesey’s—took home the award in 2015 before being drafted second overall by the Sabres last June.
Nonetheless, Peter Donatelli, one of Vesey’s advisors, revealed Monday why the move is purely a gamble.
“In our opinion, the only thing that has happened is now the Sabres have stepped into the shoes of Nashville for exclusive rights until Aug. 15,” Donatelli told ESPN. “However, at this time, it doesn’t change Jimmy Vesey’s intention to become a free agent on Aug. 15.”
Only time will tell whether or not Vesey lands in Buffalo now, but if what Murray said to TSN is any indication, the Sabres are ready to put their best foot forward.
"Why not us?," he asked. "Why not give it a shot?"

Today marks the official start to summer (if you couldn’t tell by the steadily rising temperatures) which means, above anything else, it’s time to start having some real fun and seriously question your decision to trade your air-conditioned house for a hot dorm during the summer.
For people hanging around Harvard, the sad reality that parties are “prohibited” in dorms for the next few months might have seemed like the death knell for your turn up plans this summer. But never fear: Flyby has you covered with our weekly rundown of all the fun activities and events going on in Cambridge and Boston this week. 
Summer Solstice CelebrationMonday at 5 p.m. | 11 Divinity Avenue
Harvard Museums of Science and Culture are kicking off the summer with food, fun, and performances at their Summer Solstice celebration on Monday night. The event is completely free to the public (none of that Harvard ID business), and it features free admission to four of Harvard’s coolest museums and a sweet lineup of local food trucks. What says summer better than counting down the solstice with friends and a nice cone of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream?
Central Square City Dance PartyFriday at 7 p.m. | Central Square
Who needs a cramped and hot dorm when you can dance your heart out in the middle of the street (this time without almost getting hit by a car—looking at you late-night yardlings walking back from House parties and goofing about on Mass. Ave)? Cambridge’s City Council must’ve been thinking about us when they decided to throw a dance party in Central Square. The party is free and open to the public, meaning you’ll get to jiggy to Drake’s “One Dance” with thousands of Cambridge residents (and tourists!). The entire square will be “closed to traffic but open for dancing,” so there’s no excuse not to get out of the Harvard bubble.
The Summer Social “White Party”Saturday at 8 p.m. | William James Hall
Speaking of parties, the Harvard Extension Business Society and Harvard Extension Student Association are throwing an all-white party atop William James Hall this Saturday. If you want to party on the roof of one of the windiest buildings on campus (and you are 21+), head out to this sweet summer event. There will be an open bar, food, and live music from Boston’s DJ Alexander Padei. Check out the event's Facebook page to reserve your tickets ($12 early bird, $15 regular).
Harvard Movie Night Saturday at 6:30 p.m. | Science Center Hall B
Summer School students (and anyone with a Harvard ID, really) have it lucky: Harvard is hosting weekly movie nights every Friday and Saturday night through July 30th. And we’re not talking old movies that you’ve probably seen a million times; these are recent blockbusters. First up for this Saturday is Jurassic World, so if you’re a dinosaur fan, or if you just want to see Chris Pratt make quips at CGI-beasts, then head over to Science Center Hall B to catch the flick.
Shameless BingingAnytime | Your Room
Bet you didn’t see this one coming. While we’re all for getting out of bed and actually doing things with our lives, when else do Harvard students get the chance to binge relentlessly, without fear of wasting valuable time that could be spent psetting or trying to save the world? If you haven’t already burnt through the new season of Orange is the New Black, then take Sunday to plop down in front of your TV or phone and lose yourself in one of Netflix’s best shows. Unfortunately, there might not be much “Netflix and Chilling” going on given how hot these summer dorms get, but you’re all smart. You can make it work.
