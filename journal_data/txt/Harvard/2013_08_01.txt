After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In April, President Faust announced that Boston attorney Michael B. Keating would “verify” the University’s initial findings concerning the timeline and scope of unauthorized email searches that took place regarding the Government 1310 cheating case. While the Keating report assures us that the chronology presented by administrators was accurate, it does little to assuage the deficit of trust that emerged through the scandal.
The great institutional failure visible in the Keating report is the utter lack of knowledge of important FAS policy throughout the University and a resulting failure to abide by it. It fails to explain many instances of questionable conduct on the part of administrators, while, in the space of a footnote, detailing a complete breakdown in the diffusion and execution of FAS policy.
At the bottom of page 20, we learn that “neither the HUIT Employee nor the FAS administrators who approved the searches knew about” the FAS email privacy policy. Even the Office of General Counsel, the University’s legal advisory body that played a central role in executing the searches, did not ensure that it did not infringe privacy policy. “No attorney at the OGC appears to have been aware of” the FAS email privacy policy, and “as a matter of practice, the OGC is not asked to ‘approve’ privacy policies adopted by different institutions at the University,” Keating writes.
Furthermore, the report uncovers that FAS Dean Michael D. Smith was sent an email describing a planned search of “Resident Dean X’s” mailbox for correspondence with Crimson reporters. The institutional failure to take privacy seriously is yet again signified by Smith’s decision to “not focus” on the description of this search, and “not read past the first page” of such an important email.
The privacy task force convened by President Faust should take these revelations seriously, as should Faust herself in formulating interim policies. They should not merely focus on revising guidelines, but also ensure more effective practices are in place—for disseminating policy, for training technicians, lawyers, and administrators to adhere to policy, and for enforcing policy. In order for it to serve any purpose, privacy policy must be respected by the University staff as a whole.
Despite describing a widespread ignorance of privacy policy, the report does not see it fit to examine the many unjustified actions taken by administrators in the case of “Resident Dean X,” whose mailbox was searched after sharing with two students an internal email advising Administrative Board members on how to counsel undergraduates implicated in the cheating scandal.
Keating asserts that “all actions taken in connection with these email searches were undertaken in good faith.” In fact, Keating takes great pain to carefully reason how those conducting the email searches were probably doing so with proper intentions of protecting students’ identities.
Yet this reasoning fails due to notable omissions in Keating’s investigation. A number of important questions remain that may or may not have been inside the purview of the report as Keating understood it.
Keating did not investigate why “Resident Dean X” was threatened with sanctions while acting in good faith and adhering to the letter of the confidentiality statement included in the email. This dean was forwarding an email with advising instructions that would have reached the ears of advisees regardless. Additionally, the confidentiality statement does not say that the email may not be forwarded by recipients, only specifying that unintended recipients “may not review, copy or distribute this message.”
The report also does not clarify why the search for correspondence with Crimson reporters conducted on the dean’s administrative account was extended back to January 2012--months before the Gov 1310 final--when the forwarded email in question was first sent to this dean on August 16, 2012.
Keating’s conclusion that those executing the email searches were acting “in good faith” demands more serious consideration so long as these questions are not answered.
The institutional failure to protect privacy exposed in the Keating report highlights the urgency of understanding how and why University officials conducted these searches in the manner they did, so that such a situation can be prevented from ever happening again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, CNN news anchor Don Lemon went on the air and addressed an entire American demographic. “Black people, if you really want to fix the problem, here’s just five things you should think about doing.” And with that, Lemon proposed a five-step plan for racial uplift in America.
Don Lemon has been at the forefront of an on-the-air race dialogue this summer ever since the media circus on the Travvon Martin trial began. He has spoken on issues such as racial profiling and the N-word, and though some of his opinions have been controversial, I appreciated the simple fact that such discourse was allowed to take place in a public dialogue within mainstream media.
However, during this Saturday’s segment, he overstepped a significant boundary—not because, as some might think, he aired out the black community’s dirty laundry to CNN’s audience, comprised mostly of white, middle-class viewers. Rather, Lemon crossed the line because he put forth a simplistic argument, attributing the current woes of black urban youths to the superficial differences in appearance that allegedly distinguish them from their white peers. Even though he is careful to say that his words only apply to a certain group within the black community, the very pronouncement of his five-step plan promotes an unproductive discourse on black pathology and worse, supports perilous untruths underlying justifications of discriminatory behavior, effectively absolving the public of the responsibility to treat people fairly no matter how they look.
The first of the five steps provides succinct insight to his misguided advice: Young black men,  “[P]ull up your pants.” He points to the prison culture from which this clothing trend derives and claims that this link to delinquency fuels diminished employment opportunity. After his quick explanation he plays a clip of himself on The Wendy Williams Show in which he concludes that sagging pants are indicative of sagging self-esteem.
It is true—the appearance of young black males incontestably affects employment opportunity, but it is reductive to point to clothing selection as a chief cause of this problem. Although Lemon himself has addressed the issue of racial profiling by law enforcement in the past, in this piece, he overlooks the role that stereotyping plays in the context of the workplace, in the reading of an application, in an interview—regardless of impressive credentials or shoulders swathed in the fine wool of an Armani suit. Certainly, black men do not only face disadvantage when wearing saggy clothing.
Additionally, if Lemon identifies poor self-esteem as the underlying source of pants below the belt, then why not make a suggestion that speaks to, or at least acknowledges, the historical and systematic oppression of the young black man’s spirit?
The words “structural inequality” get thrown around a lot, and to some extent the American public, and particularly the Harvard student body, is desensitized to the weight of meaning behind the ubiquitous phrase. Nevertheless, without recognition of the structural flaws that play such an enormous role in dictating an individual’s life outcomes, we unreasonably place the burden of change on the agency of a single person.
With all this said, by no means do I aim to imply that the individual has no responsibility in fighting for his own fortune and success. Encouraging work ethic and a sense dignity doesn’t do harm—but speaking as if the entire black population is without these attributes demeans and insults the sizable number of African Americans struggling in spite of their arduous efforts and hopeful pride.
Everyone—black and white, Asian and Latino—has a part to play in making America better, in healing wounds that have long festered and spread like a virus in the body politic.
But that’s just it: This is a collective struggle. We are fighting for the future of our country, and there are action items for each of us.
Change for black people does not begin with blaming black people. Instead, it starts with a pervasive admission and acceptance of a glorious and soiled history that belongs to the United States. It begins with information and a knowledgeable public that has the contextual bearings to engage in these discussions to begin with. It starts with acknowledgement of inequities that exist today, not only in reference to the nation’s historical sins. America’s only hope for resolution is heavily dependent on swallowing the context in which we root our efforts to mitigate racial tension.
And if a call to action is necessary, then it should be a call to those with privilege to advocate on behalf of those without. There is a place for the individual’s agency and effort, but our responsibility lies in protecting the American promise of equality through improvements in American education. It begins in our schools.
In one of his points, Lemon challenges young black kids not to give up on their education without challenging schools not to give up on young black kids.  Encouraging black youth to tenaciously pursue education is indeed a good thing, but if Lemon wants to see the median academic index among black students truly rise, he needs to look first to the school system that is cheating youth of their right to education. There are students throughout the country who can discern society’s presumption of their failure before they have even neared the “prison pipeline.” In fact, it is unashamedly reflected in the resources afforded to their county’s public schools, particularly in urban areas.
In Chicago, the city has agreed to provide $33 million to fund a private basketball stadium for DePaul University, even though the Chicago Public School system disgracefully languishes. Just last week, 9-year-old Asean Johnson appeared before the school board of a city that has decided to close 50 schools since March and is also currently facing a $1 billion operating deficit. Tears streaked down this young man’s face as he pleaded for a quality education.
So in the end, it’s not just about telling students to stay in school or socializing our children to be empathetic. We don’t only need to include in curricula holistic texts of America’s tried and true past, the good, bad, and ugly. We need to make this education, this opportunity, accessible to all. We need a system that shouts “I believe in you!” when a child walks into the classroom no matter the neighborhood or congressional district—no matter that child’s creed or color. We shouldn’t believe that this responsibility exclusively rests with teachers, superintendents, and parents. It belongs to every American citizen invested in seeing the country continue to flourish.
Don Lemon is correct in implying that we need to change our expectations, particularly of American youth, but he is wrong in assuming this shift in outlook will take place if individuals in his position of power validate the practice of judging an individual’s worth based on stereotypes and falsehoods.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of workers, union members, and labor activists turned out Wednesday for two separate rallies to protest Harvard Medical School’s decision to cut 31 custodial contract jobs.
A morning rally at the Medical School’s Longwood campus drew more than 50 people, according to a union employee, while an afternoon rally that began in front of Holyoke Center and turned into a march through Harvard Yard attracted more than 80 protesters.
 
The terminations follow the Medical School’s cancellation of its contract with American Cleaning Company, Inc., a Brighton-based subcontractor that contracted the 31 custodial workers. The cuts were expected to take place on Aug. 17 but have since been delayed to September.
Richard M. Shea, the Medical School’s associate dean for campus planning and facilities, said in an interview in July that the terminations are being made to reduce the Medical School’s operating deficit. Approximately 60 additional custodial workers directly employed by the Medical School will keep their current jobs amidst the cuts, which are expected to save the Medical School up to $1 million.
Still, protesters alleged on Wednesday that the cuts are both unjust and unnecessary.
“Principally, we want to make sure that folks know that these cuts are happening, and also that they don’t need to happen,” Eliza Sparkes, a communications specialist for the Service Employees International Union Local 615, said in an interview at the afternoon rally. “Harvard is claiming that they have to balance their budget, that they have a deficit, and yet they’re looking to cut some of the lowest-paid workers at the school instead of looking to see where else in the vast wealth that is Harvard that they can make changes.”
Shea said in July that to address the operating deficit, the Medical School is evaluating its operations across the board. And Gina Vild, associate dean for communications and external relations at the Medical School, wrote in an email Tuesday that the custodial service cuts are “one of a number of strategies that has been proposed to address the School's substantial operating deficit.”
But for the protesters at the rallies, the human cost of the cuts was too high.
“I’m here today because I like to support the workers,” Itamar Sangiorgio, a custodial worker with the Harvard Library, said as he passed out flyers outside Holyoke Center at the start of the rally. “I know it’s important to support them because we work hard, we help improve Harvard...and I know that their families are going to be suffering at this time.”
Nereida Calderon, one of the contracted custodial workers at the Medical School who will lose her job in September, said in an interview after the afternoon rally that she felt grateful for the protesters’ support. She spoke in Spanish through a translator.
The two rallies on Wednesday were not the first signs of outcry against the cuts. A petition in opposition of the cuts began circulating, both online and in paper form, after the union learned of Harvard’s plans in June. Sparkes said that both forms of the petition had each collected almost 300 signatures as of Wednesday. And on Monday, the Cambridge City Council approved a resolution “condemning” the decision.

We already knew that the College’s drugs and alcohol policy tiptoes around the question of whether we can play beer pong. But a gradebook released last week by the nonprofit organization Students for Sensible Drug Policy points out that the policy is vague on other questions too.
 
SSDP, which "neither condones nor condemns drug use," according to its website, gave Harvard’s alcohol and drug policy a 'B' grade—an above-average mark among the 300 colleges evaluated as part of the project. (We, accustomed to Harvard's generous grade-inflation, aren't used to thinking of a 'B' as "above-average," but we'll take their word for it.)
 
SSDP's website describes Harvard's policy as "vague," saying it is "unclear which sanctions apply to which violations." It notes, however, that a "full medical amnesty policy is in place"—albeit one that some students told The Crimson has discouraged them from seeking medical help out of concern about potential repercussions.
 
Drew Stromberg, an outreach director for SSDP, said in a phone interview Wednesday that Harvard's policy is "overall very good," in part because the College's amnesty policy covers both alcohol and drugs and offers protection for both the victim and the caller. The "only thing" that prevented the policy from receiving an 'A,' he said, was its vagueness about sanctions. Specifically, Stromberg said, the policy doesn't make a distinction between sanctions for all marijuana policy violations versus a typical sanction for the first violation.
 
We pulled up the policy to see if he was right. The College Handbook for Students does not mention sanctions for marijuana use specifically, instead grouping together infractions including "the use of illicit drugs, underage possession or consumption of alcohol, serving alcohol to underage individuals, or overconsumption of alcohol." The policy does differentiate between administrators’ initial response to drug or alcohol violations ("a warning and/or referral" to the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services) and their more strict responses to a "pattern" of rule-breaking behavior. But as Stromberg notes, it's not precise about the response to a first-time violation for marijuana or any other drug.
 
Back in 2005, Administrative Board Secretary John "Jay" L. Ellison told The Crimson that the Ad Board will not issue punishment if a student is caught simply smoking marijuana. In recent cases in which students were punished, he said at the time, the offense was broader than just drug use.
 
We reached out to College spokesperson Colin Manning to get more information about the response to a first-time marijuana violation under the most recent iteration of Harvard's drugs and alcohol policy. But the statement he provided, while noting that the policy is "designed to protect the health and safety of all undergraduates," didn't answer our question.
