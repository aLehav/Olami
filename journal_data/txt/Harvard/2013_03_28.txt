After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The  worst criticism for a piece of art to receive is to be deemed  forgettable. Good art provokes reaction from its audience and can allow  us to see and experience the world in new ways. Bad art accomplishes  much of the same, if for entirely different reasons. In both good and  bad art, the audience engages with the work and is changed, even if only  very slightly. Art challenges us.
 
Forgettable  art does none of this. It has no impact on its audience. They see it,  or read it, or hear it, and then they walk away as if they had never  encountered it at all.
 
I  open with this distinction because, without a doubt, "Olympus Has  Fallen" is the most forgettable film in quite some time. It has come and  it will go and it will have changed nothing.
 
You  should stop reading now. Much like the film itself, this review is  going to continue on, filling space and time and being of absolutely no  import. There is nothing to write about a film that does not deserve, in  any way, to be remembered.
 
In  "Olympus Has Fallen," the White House (code name: Olympus) is attacked  by North Koreans, and it's up to one man to rescue the president: a  Secret Service agent played by Gerard Butler, an actor who wants to be  both an action star and a romantic-comedian and has ended up as neither.  Butler’s character has a slightly strained relationship with the  President (Aaron Eckhart) because at the beginning of the film, Butler  let the First Lady fall off a bridge. Morgan Freeman plays the Speaker  of the House, who becomes acting President during the crisis. All of  these characters have names, but I don't remember them. Frankly, there  is no reason to.
 
The  North Koreans have an elaborate scheme. They are going to make all of  America’s nukes explode at once, turning the country into a horrifying  apocalyptic hellscape. There is no tension here, though, since the  film's CGI Washington Monument and chintzy imitation White House make it  clear that the film’s budget cannot also provide the visual effects for  a horrifying nuclear hellscape. There are YouTube videos as convincing  as the stuff in "Olympus Has Fallen." 
 
There  are actors in the film, but there is no attempt at acting. It is more  akin to sleepwalking. Gerard Butler relies on the annoying gimmick of  smirking after every line. Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman lazily spend  the entire film sitting down, speaking words but saying nothing.  Actually, nobody says much of anything, the brief exception being  Melissa Leo as a Cabinet member who is dragged down the hallway whilst  yelling the Pledge of Allegiance: the seconds-long sequence is just  moronic enough to provoke a tiny snicker and earn the film its  half-star.
 
There  is absolutely no more drama to be mined from attacking the President or  the White House. Roland Emmerich famously obliterated the building in  "Independence Day" and by the time he dropped an aircraft carrier on it  in "2012," the television series "24" had made it an annual tradition to  imperil the Commander in Chief. The video game Call of Duty: Modern  Warfare has already let players virtually shoot their way through the  Oval Office. That's in addition to similar assaults on the highest  office in the nation in "Mars Attacks!," "X2," "Superman 2," and "Air  Force One." Nicolas Cage kidnapped the president in the sequel to  "National Treasure." Slated for release in June of this year, "White  House Down" will swap out Gerard Butler for the much more preferable  Channing Tatum. That film's director? Also Roland Emmerich.
 
Maybe  one day, American studios will have the audacity to kill the President,  but it is not this day. At some point in "Olympus Has Fallen," after  some supposedly shocking thing, Morgan Freeman reclines in his chair,  head tilted, mouth slightly agape, eyes glazed over. He's supposed to  seem paralyzed with shock, but maybe he just already knows the outcome  of this film and is likewise bored into a stupor.
 
The  act of reviewing "Olympus Has Fallen"—not the film itself—is  frustrating. There is nothing to say about this film. Why are you still  here? Spring has sprung, and there are lives to be lived and songs to be  sung. Do not see "Olympus Has Fallen." Let it fade away and wither to  dust.

You may not know much about Tyga. You may not know, for example, that his stage name is an acronym that stands for Thank You God Always. He also may not have been your top choice to headline Yardfest this year.
That's okay. The Arts Blog is here to acquaint you with the untold joys of Tyga's oeuvre. Here are six songs you might want to check out before Tyga plays Yardfest on April 13.
"Do My Dance" (feat. 2 Chainz)
Tyga would like everyone to know that his women share a refined taste in cuisine, unlike Kanye and Jay-Z's fish fillet-loving females: "Order calamari, say she want that fettucine / Five-star bitches, my bitches don't eat at Denny's." Also, 2 Chainz, duh.
"Rack City"
Repeat: "Rack city bitch, rack, rack city bitch / Ten ten ten twenties on ya titties, bitch." You're now caught up with everybody else's knowledge of Tyga. Cool. 
"Fuck For the Road" (feat. Chris Brown)
This cut is from Tyga's upcoming album "Hotel California," which will be released April 9 (you're going to want to pick up a copy so you can study up before Yardfest). It's nice to see that Tyga is helping Chris Brown by giving Brown opportunities to sing about his feelings while he goes completely crazy. Because, you know, letting a man convicted of beating his girlfriend sing "all I ever wanted was your happiness" in your song can only be a good thing.
"I'm Different"
"She like when I talk shit like Bill O'Reilly," Tyga raps on this cut from his "187" mixtape. Hey, Tyga: if she also likes it when you talk shit about Bill O'Reilly, she might be a Harvard student.
"Faded" (feat. Lil Wayne) and "Coconut Juice" (feat. Travie McCoy)
Both of these songs are mostly notable for their delightful music videos. "Faded" basically consists of Tyga and Weezy strutting around with digitally enlarged heads—no symbolism intended; why do you ask? "Coconut Juice" is a crazy middle school throwback, complete with a hilarious cameo from Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz. It'll transport you right back to your seventh-grade self's bad haircuts, worse complexion, and even worse music tastes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent troubling analysis of student college applications found that despite extensive financial aid and outreach initiatives, most high-achieving, low-income high school students fail to even apply to America’s most selective colleges.
This trend persists “despite the fact that selective institutions would often cost them less, owing to generous financial aid, than the resource-poor two-year and non-selective four-year institutions to which they actually apply,” the report noted. This trend is especially alarming, since a significant portion of these promising students attend local colleges with lower graduation rates, making it less likely that they will graduate with a college degree—an increasingly important factor in securing higher wages and full employment.
Of high-achieving high school seniors, only 34 percent of those in the bottom quartile of the income distribution applied to selective college and universities as compared to 78 percent of those in the top quartile. Within this talented pool, there are 15 high-income student applications for every low-income student application.
Both colleges and students are harmed by this pattern by needlessly restricting their choices—students lose access to resources and opportunities including generous financial aid programs at selective schools, and colleges lose out on promising candidates to the detriment of socioeconomic diversity. Selective universities can and should pursue keener outreach. The report asserted, “widely-used policies—college admissions, staff recruiting, college campus visits, college access programs—are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students.”
The dearth of applications is partially explained by the tendency of talented students with lesser means to adopt different application strategies—as opposed to the recommended strategy of applying to a range of schools—than their higher-income peers largely follow. Part of the problem is the isolation of these students, both at the geographic and high school levels, from other high achievers, which deprives them of first-hand knowledge through their teachers or counselors of programs at selective colleges that would significantly reduce the financial burdens for higher education.
Harvard has maintained a commendable policy of outreach to high-achieving low-income students, supported by exceptional financial resources that fund broader searches. But that Harvard’s undergraduate student body is still not very economically diverse is a sign that more work is needed. Encouragingly, Harvard recently announced that it would raise next year’s financial aid budget by $10 million, a nearly six-percent increase.
The onus is on selective universities, increasingly seen as the gatekeepers to success, to engineer better-targeted outreach. More personalized recruiting techniques through calls and emails, but especially through actual alumni representatives, should be prioritized over the glossy viewbooks listing high sticker prices that can intimidate lower income applicants.
The opportunities offered by America’s best colleges ought to go to those students who are qualified rather than those who are simply wealthier. The mark of a truly meritocratic system of higher education and a robust, mobile economy will be a student body whose composition faithfully reflects the economic diversity of high-achieving students in the United States.

This is a manifesto on why, when your pants feel too tight, you should take them off. And no, I’m not joking.
It’s 11:25 in the morning. I haven’t even eaten lunch yet, but already I taste regret. Regret that the theme of my entire day is going to be tight pants. What was I thinking this morning when I stepped into these ultra snug and stiff cords? Why are these pants so damn tight anyways? I have got to stop eating six bowls of cereal at brain break every night. I wonder if I can squeeze a quick run in between class and section?
Recently, much attention on campus has been drawn to mental health issues, and rightfully so. There is nothing more important a university can provide for its students than mental health services that are accessible to all, sympathetic to how difficult it can be to reach out for help and committed to addressing the needs of every student no matter how complicated his or her situation may be. But the issue this manifesto seeks to address has become so normalized that I fear it escapes recognition as a pervasive mental health issue.
I am not talking about diagnosable eating disorders, per se, although they are undoubtedly deserving of attention. Rather, I wish to recognize a phenomenon so common it is not understood to be seriously detrimental—that of body dissatisfaction.
According to a survey conducted in 1996, over half of American women age 18-25 would rather be “run over by a truck” than “be fat,” and two-thirds would rather be “mean or stupid.” In recent years, as obesity-related problems have increased while societal ideals of beauty continue to become less and less attainable, I can only imagine the result this survey question would yield today. In a more recent study of young to middle-aged women never diagnosed with an eating disorder, nearly 75 percent reported experiencing concerns about shape and weight that impeded their happiness.
Perpetual discontent with our own bodies is the status quo, and we must not pretend that it is an issue that only touches a certain “type.” You know…ballerinas, models, perfectionists, and “those girls” who are obsessed with how they look and what others think of them. This manifesto isn’t for a subset of the population who the books say are at risk. No one is immune. If you live in this country (or a whole host of other countries, for that matter) in the 21st century and you’ve ever let pants that feel a little too tight make you feel fat, lazy, ugly, or really anything less than awesome, this manifesto is for you.
We simply cannot accept body dissatisfaction as the norm. We must not, for we have far too many jobs before us to be preoccupied with tight pants and the like. We need to fix a broken education system, solve global climate change, protect women’s rights around the world, improve access to mental health care, fight for marriage equality, cure diseases, explore new planets, and do a host of other things we don’t even know we have to do yet.
You see, we can eat right and exercise, but still, on some days, our pants are going to feel too tight. But what we must not forget is that we get to choose what we do with our tight pants. We can use that thigh-squeezing, belly-compressing feeling as motivation to avoid carbohydrates like the plague, drink water until we’re full, and kick up the treadmill a few notches. We can try to avoid the eminent “rippppppp” right at the crotch by becoming enthralled with egg whites, spending more time squeezing our knees together to see if our thighs touch, and scanning menus for “good” foods.
We can drive ourselves insane doing these things, perhaps unaware of the impact they have on our relationships with others, our energy and personalities, our happiness, and our self-esteem. The tightness of our pants, however seemingly impertinent, controls us—a constant reminder that we are not thin enough, toned enough, fit enough, disciplined enough. Without meaning to, we can let a burning desire to escape tight pants co-opt our identities.
But we don’t have to, for there is something else we can do. We can take those tight pants off—redefine health to include the whole self, embrace our bodies for all that they are, and march forward using our drive and passion to better the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Do you think you and your friends are afraid of succeeding?” my mother asked across the dinner table last week. I shook my head emphatically.
“I think we’re afraid of not succeeding,” I responded between bites of a sumptuous feast of homemade eggplant parmesan and pasta.
I’m sure I would not have enjoyed meals as delicious as my mother’s for the first 18 years of my life (sorry, Annenberg, but you just don’t measure up) if she had chosen to apply her B.A. from Yale, M.A. from Columbia, and J.D. from Harvard in the paid workforce rather than as a soldier in America’s army of stay-at-home moms. Lucky for me, even through year after year of high-intensity schooling, the fast track never truly appealed to my mother.  She was happy to step off and slow down when I was born. In fact, she says, she’s glad that she’s a woman. That way, no one faults her for choosing childcare over career.
Of course, there’s the problem: the fact that so many women feel they must make a choice at all.  As Anne-Marie Slaughter puts it, even nearly a century after the 19th amendment enshrined women’s suffrage, “Women Still Can’t Have It All.”  Slaughter, who left her job at the State Department to spend more time with her family, argues that the antiquated belief that the working world belongs to men and the home to women is not so outdated after all. Rather, it remains ingrained in our collective mindset. The consequences of that perception, maintains Slaughter, pervade our workplaces: Policies render it impossible for women both to keep demanding jobs and to care for demanding children. Employers and society as a whole need to adapt to accommodate devotion to family.  Then and only then will women have a fair professional shake.
Sheryl K. Sandberg ‘91, the chief operating officer of Facebook, would beg to differ.  As far as Sandberg is concerned, women could have it all—if they would just buck up and try. In her 2011 Barnard commencement address, Sandberg presented the thesis on which she later built an entire book: “We will never close the achievement gap until we close the ambition gap.” Women sabotage themselves by holding back in the present when it comes to professional advancement because they anticipate a difficult balance between acting as breadwinner and homemaker down the road. The onus of changing the status quo, according to Sandberg, lies not with corporations but with women who must “Lean In” to their career paths and keep pushing until they’ve reached the pinnacle of success.
Slaughter and Sandberg may disagree on the cause of the dearth of women in leadership positions both nationally and internationally, but no one should dispute that we face a problem: Women make up only 18.2 percent of the United States Congress and only 16 percent of corporate directors and officers.
So, where does that leave me? I wasn’t lying when I told my mother that I believe my female peers and I fear not success but rather falling short of it, and I also believe many of us enrolled at Harvard for exactly that reason. Yet a report commissioned by the Undergraduate Council and the Harvard Women’s Center earlier in the month revealed that organizations students consider “prestigious” are largely male-run, and men also outnumber women in extracurricular pursuits dubbed “academic” or “governmental.” The infamous glass ceiling certainly remains intact in the professional world, but might it exist already at the college level, even at an institution that prides itself on its liberal outlook and on the drive of all its students? And if it does, do women bar themselves from achievement as Sandberg contends, or do Slaughter’s myriad structural factors work against them?
The battle between Slaughter and Sandberg presents a false dichotomy. In reality, the two authors’ views are far from mutually exclusive. Perhaps, as Sandberg claims, women do refrain from seizing every opportunity for advancement, worried that other obligations later in life will prevent them from following up on earlier progress. If that’s the case, however, those who would otherwise love to head up both the office and the household likely pull out of the race to the top because of the very social and corporate factors Slaughter identifies. If anything is to change, the impetus must come from players on both sides of the court. By all means, women should lean in, but their partners and employers must support them, or they will fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The events unfolded quickly. At about 9 a.m., I had already received two texts about the incendiary op-ed in The Crimson. By about 3 p.m., I was being invited to rallies. Students outraged about the state of mental health services at Harvard, unconcerned with the selection bias inherent in “I Am Fine” and “In Sight, Out of Mind,” vowed to avenge the perceived negligence of the university. Picketing outside University buildings the next day, the mental health issue looked poised to take off. The Crimson’s weekly Roundtable asked the pointed question, “Do you think that Harvard has serious mental health deficiencies?” The irate student body was up in arms.
The lack of introspection in the article was troubling—the anonymous “In Sight, Out of Mind” author largely shied away from discussing how Harvard’s students engenders a culture in which insecurities are exacerbated. Weeks later, now that the dust has settled, it is easy to draw a larger lesson from “In Sight, Out of Mind”: Social activism at Harvard is a tepid shell of what it used to be.
This trend is not unique to Harvard, but a national phenomenon. Since the Vietnam War, when American citizens everywhere protested in the streets about the war and student outcries on campus carried the same vigor they had over civil rights a decade earlier, the mood of the country has shifted dramatically. A rebirth of political cynicism has turned people off to the idea of true protest. Occupy Wall Street notwithstanding, America’s hoi polloi have reluctantly acknowledged that change is made with lobbying and special interest groups, not Molotov cocktails and protest marches.
Activism, by nature, is diametrically opposed to Harvard’s hypercompetitive culture of progress and resumes. Activism is a long and patient process; Occupy Wall Street lasted for months without an actual resolution in favor of the protestors, and union negotiations can go on for half a year without any progress. Common examples of activism—anti-abortion groups, women’s equality groups, homosexual rights groups—have struggled for decades without getting the concessions that they desire. That’s not to say that these groups are in any way incompetent or lazy. Activism requires a devoted time commitment and many hours spent at the bargaining table or in the legislative office, trying to help a contract or a bill secure enough to be a victory and a compromise—achieving that elusive feeling where everyone wins. At Harvard, where immediately tangible achievement is lionized, such work is a foreign concept.
Activism comes with a few social demerits. Careers in activism aren’t immediately appealing to the stereotypical student looking to become instantly self-sufficient after college. They are even less attractive to students faced with onerous student debt or preexisting poverty. What’s more, conservative students may be turned off by the preponderance of liberal activist causes on campus. Harvard’s small social activist scene is very slanted towards stereotypically liberal causes; labor rights and environmentalism, two prominent campus issues, are connoted liberal topics. In fact, few conservative activist groups, for whose causes the liberal student body shows significantly less sympathy, exist at all.
The student body has shown the ability to coalesce over an issue—student support of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and the “In Sight, Out of Mind” piece demonstrates a collective desire to defy the University—but sustained protest is generally frowned upon. After a simple cost-benefit analysis, activism simply doesn’t fit into many Harvard students’ schedules. Pre-professional programs and challenging academics beckon; varsity athletic teams and student publications leave students too tired to protest on others’ behalves.
Gazing in the rearview mirror, my guess is that “In Sight, Out of Mind” has a similar future to “I Am Fine.” Both serve as consistent reminders of both a cause most students feel strongly about: the care of those with mental afflictions. However, both also remind us of the whimsical nature of our activism on campus. While mobilizing around an incendiary piece is easy, sustaining that drive is much more difficult. Lost in the rage against the University was the potential for other student health groups to work with the University to fix some of the issues brought up in “In Sight, Out of Mind.” This cooperative version of activism is more at odds with the modern conception of the word than its combative history. To say that Harvard students are too apathetic for activism would be wrong, but arguing that they are simply too busy is similarly incorrect. The reality splits the difference; for most, activism just isn’t worth the time it takes.

When I was 13, I learned a new meaning for the alphabet, or at least its first four letters. “A, B, C, D,” my cousin said one day over a family lunch. “American Born Confused Desi.”
I laughed: We all did. It was a joke. Born to Indian parents in the U.S., we called ourselves American but we felt Indian. Right? I convinced myself that I did. In retrospect, I should have paid more attention to the fact that I had just swallowed a seed of confusion. If I told my grandma, she’d correct me and call it a mango pit—I learned disappointingly late in life that the pits are not edible, that they are, essentially, seeds. As I sipped my water, I felt the confusion growing, spiraling out into that newly defined capital “C.”
I ignored the thoughts. I wasn’t ready for an existential crisis at 13, or 14, or 15. Yet, when I turned 16, I was suddenly at a ripe age for cultural panic. It started at my grandfather’s funeral, where my cousins and I were told to recite pujas. They did so successfully. When it was my turn to share a song in my family’s native Gujarati, my tongue twisted itself into a knot, and I fell silent.
Despite my cultural failure, this is not supposed to be a dramatic story. That moment did finally convince me that I was indeed confused, and for once, I admitted to myself those four letters that I had so tactfully avoided for years. I was an ABCD. My mom recognized this too, and found humor in it. She once called me an ABCD, smiled, and then tossed me a book titled “Born Confused.” The cover had a picture of an Indian girl with a bright red question mark stamped in the middle of her forehead. The synopsis revealed my life in fiction-form: A girl named Dimple Lala grows up in New Jersey to Indian parents, feeling torn between American and Indian cultures.
Five years later, as a senior in college, I decided at last that I was too old to stay confused. I might be 21 years late, but who’s counting (apart from, maybe, my grandmother)? Inspired by a desire for self-discovery, I signed up to take Diana Eck’s class on Gandhi this semester. It may sound arbitrary, but don’t worry. I didn’t open up the Spring 2013 catalog, close my eyes and point to a random course listed under South Asian Studies. I’m not that confused, I hope.
The previous semester, my dad had sent me an email with a photo of Gandhi standing with my great-grandfather. I had heard about my great-grandfather and knew that he once served as Chief Minister of Gujarat. Slowly, I began to learn what that meant, and over J-Term, I devoted an afternoon to hearing my grandmother’s stories of growing up in the capital. However, I soon realized that this was only the beginning of my family’s history.
As we began reading Gandhi’s autobiography in Diana Eck’s class, we came across a certain Mavji Dave, whom Gandhi knew as a young boy. This is when the ABCD in me rang out loud and clear. Incredibly excited that Mavji and I shared our last names, I called my dad asking if we were related. He laughed and told me that while our last name was uncommon in the U.S., in India, there are thousands of Daves. The odds of being related to Mavji were slim to none.
Disheartened and confused, I dropped that conversation and we began discussing other things. Then a few minutes later, my dad suddenly interrupted me. “Have you heard of a Nanalal Kavi?” he asked. “We’re related to him.” What? Apparently, this man was a poet in Gujarat and also my great-great-great grandfather.
I Googled Nanalal Kavi expecting to find no results. However, instead, I came across a Wikipedia page, websites with his writings, and even a few images. In the rush of my excitement, I plugged his name into Hollis.
Once again, I was surprised. I found 73 hits. After scrolling through, I realized that his works were on microfilm in the Library of Congress and that there was even a book located in the bowels of Widener on the one and only Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi. Squirming with excitement like a five -year-old, I couldn’t fall asleep, I remember, until 2 a.m. that night.
Post-thesis, I finally made my way over to Widener for a leisurely (if that’s possible) stroll through the stacks. I pulled out the book. It was coated in dust, and the records slip showed that no one had checked it out since it had been donated to Harvard in 1959. I didn’t mind. Corny as it was, I felt a rush of pride as I held a bit of my family’s history.
When I told my dad, I could feel him glowing with pride over the phone. However, I wondered how my great-great-great grandfather would have felt knowing that there was a book about him and his poetry sitting in the Harvard library system.
I perched myself on a windowsill in the stacks and skimmed through the book. I was immediately stunned to find that he was a die-hard romantic. Then, as I continued reading, I came across one of his passages, which has since stuck with me:
The barque of Destiny,        Having flashed its ardent callUnto our resurgent souls,        Is waiting on the shore,To take us on our voyage, past the turmoil of human life.
Maybe I like these verses because I’m graduating soon, and the idea of destiny, and leaving my future to fate, seems quite lovely right now. Yet these lines might also explain why I stumbled upon his poetry in the first place, and how maybe that “C” is slowly shrinking into a “c.”

I can’t tell when England becomes Scotland. There are no welcome signs when the train crosses the border, or at least none that I can see. I think the girl in front of me is English, because she’s talking on the phone with her mother about when she’ll arrive back home in London. (“I’ll miss you, mum,” she says.) The man sitting next to me must be a Scot, because I can barely understand what he is saying through his accent (“Where’s the toilet on this thing?” he just asked, I think)—and he’s actually wearing a kilt.
The five hours of this train ride fly off into the landscape we cross: London’s towers quickly fall away, giving rise to industrial areas that speed by in the short-lived, shifting frames of a flipbook. The coffee cart rolls up and down the aisles; the burly conductor nods and collects tickets; we make our first stop at a city whose name I now forget.
Farther north the houses become smaller, farther apart, gradually turning into farms. About an hour out, windmills appear in the distance, and sheep graze on green. We slow down for a number of small towns, but roll past their platforms without coming to a stop. The woman on her cell phone disembarks at the next station, but the man sitting beside me stays here.
In London a couple hours earlier, I had waited for the train to arrive at King’s Cross station with my English friend who plays in the band of the British Army. I had wanted to know what the real difference was between England, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom—outside of the formalities. “Funny,” he said, “I never really think about this much.”
In Edinburgh the next day, my friend who studies archaeology at the University will take me to the National Museum of Scotland. We’ll look at portraits of Mary, Queen of Scots, and joke about how the movie “Braveheart” might not have been an accurate depiction of Scottish history. We’ll admit it’s all we know.
On the train, before this, I fall asleep in England and wake up in Scotland with no clear conception of what has changed, or where or when. The flatter plains have morphed into cliffs, I can tell, and the sky, darker now, pokes unevenly into the tops of trees. “Look at the waves rolling in here,” says the man next to me, pointing to the window. Outside, a silvery grey under the clouds collides with shore, making itself known as the sea.

The MBTA worker who sweeps the platform at the Andrew T stop is dressed for the occasion: He wears a floppy, sequined bow tie of bright green just below his Adams apple, and shiny shamrock stickers taped to each temple.
This is the first time my blockmates and I have ventured to the St. Patrick's Day parade. Upon our arrival in South Boston, we wrestle through a sea of revelers and hop a cement barrier to find a less crowded viewing space. We find a spare square of pavement immediately before the parade begins.
The festivities kick off with a police procession. The policemen pedal on bicycles, then walk in two lines, then ride motorbikes, then walk backwards. Next, the SWAT team and Special Operations emerge, then a Boston police boat. A large truck urges spectators to “Join the Boston Police Department.” The truck-driver’s wedding ring hangs out the window, sparkling.
“They’re just showing off all their transportation,” my friend comments, lighting up a vanilla cigarillo for the occasion and letting the smoke waft up into the wind. Another friend asks if now would be a good time for him to open up one of the beers he has been concealing in the pocket of his jeans. With all the policemen marching in the parade, far fewer authorities are around to monitor the crowd.
The parade helps the streets show off a new dimension: Drunkards peep out from balconies and roofs, while one wily spectator pours green beer out of her third floor window, unaware that the dribble is landing squarely on the heads of unsuspecting passersby on the street below. Behind us a group of drunk 20-somethings dangle their feet off the roof of a local convenience store.
After the parade's first wave of local authorities, the parade's musical performers pass by. First a bagpipers chorus complete with tassels, feathery hats, and berets marches past, their tune sounding remarkably like “Battle Hymn of the Republic." Waltham’s American Legion Band has made it out for the occasion, too, but their tonal quality is questionable. The Navy Band Northeast, up next, actually sounds fairly acceptable; they are followed by the Immaculate Heart of Mary School marching band. The pubescent teens blow air into their woodwinds through crooked teeth, pimpled faces, and white, stiff fingers.
The parade continues with South Boston’s Chief Marshal Ed Flynn, Bill Linehan from The Boston City Council, and Massachusetts Senator Stephen Lynch. Saint Patrick himself also appears in two incarnations. The first wears a traditional leprechaun hat (fairly authentic looking, aside from the Chaco sandals peeping out from beneath his costume), but the dress of the second is more abstract: His costume is a giant green piece of formless felt.
The sheet metal workers union and carpenter’s union are next, followed by the Men of St. Patrick from Lawrence, Mass. “This must be all they do,” my blockmate chides, wondering how this group can possibly exist year-round.
By attempting to smatter the audience with all things Irish—an Irish wolfhound dog, boutineers with green trim, hair dyed to resemble the Irish flag—the parade seems random, not Irish in the slightest. But it is a distinctly Boston hodge-podge, a way to remember our local authorities, politicians, musicians, and, most of all, characters. I guess that can be cause for a celebration, too.

In a shocking upset over number one seed Yale, Harvard proved its worth at something besides basketball at the 2013 National Collegiate Mock Trial Tournament last week.
The perennial basketball powerhouse’s victory immediately garnered a national response. “For as long as I can remember, the word ‘Harvard’ has been synonymous with basketball,” said alumna Gale G. Miller ’08. “Now in addition to Jeremy Lin and a 2013 March Madness win over New Mexico, the school has an academic accomplishment.”
The competition, which took place in a Standing-Room-Only Sanders Theater, wasn’t without its tense moments. Down late in the trial and needing to come up big in the closing argument, the team faced intense pressure. Luckily, Mark M. Halpert ’13, the team’s top performer, was up to the task.“When I saw the category was ‘battery’ my eyes kind of lit up,” said Halpert. “I’m good at most things, but when it comes to battery, I crush trials like I crush boxes.”
Halpert, a top-100 Mock Trial-er in high school, shocked many when he chose to commit to Harvard a few summers back. “I knew Harvard was a basketball school,” he says, “but I felt up to the challenge of building a more intellectual environment.”
After barely meeting the athletic requirement for college eligibility, Halpert led the Crimson to a national title.
After the Mock Trial victory, the team’s coach, Susan Page, received a congratulatory phone call from President Barack Obama, who graduated from the Law School in 1991. “I’ve never been more pleased with my former school,” Obama said in a statement released by the White House. “Besides that time the basketball team shocked the world with a win in the first round of the NCAA tournament, which was pretty damn sweet.”
Despite the Mock Trial team’s success, Harvard’s academic program isn’t without its critics. Some have attacked the administration for siphoning athletic money toward academic resources and equipment.
Still, for many on campus and beyond, the Mock Trial championship has changed the perception of Harvard’s much-maligned academic program. “People are starting to take us seriously,” said Halpert. “For once, Harvard academics is in the spotlight instead of its basketball program. I can’t complain.”

Liz Lemon
Liz Lemon: Hello [Name], this is Liz Lemon calling to congratulate you on getting into Harvard! Harvard only accepts a very minute percentage of the exceptional pool of students who apply, so there must be something special about you, right?
Prospective Student: Well, I guess I’m the best hula-hooper in my generation.
LL: Classic. You probably have everything you’ve ever wanted. You’re probably one of those kids who gets all the girls and all the boys too. I’m actually a little jealous of you. You’re probably a smart kid, you sound happy, and your hips are loose. I could never hula-hoop—I was always the girl who had to get gym credit by picking up all the hula-hoops at the end of class. Nothing’s really changed; I’m still a middle-aged woman who has had to push back her reservations for a honeymoon suite in Hawaii for the past 10 years because she doesn’t have anyone to go with. Why don’t you just add to this pile of good luck you’ve been blessed with by going to Harvard? You know, one of my New Year’s resolutions this year was to say “yes!” Yes to going green, yes to sleeping in, yes to love, yes to life, yes to saying ‘yes’ more! I say you say ‘yes’ to Harvard, and prepare to have the best or worst four years of your life. Hey, you won’t know if you don’t try---
[Phone dial tone]
LL: Hello??… Hello??… Ugh, kids these days have such a short attention span—Pizza, I want pizza.

Oprah
Oprah: Well hello everyone! Oprah Winfrey here, calling to congratulate you on this wonderful achievement. Ladies and gentlemen, being offered to join Harvard University’s Class of 2017 will be one of the most valuable opportunities ever presented to you. Going to college is going to be different from anything you have done so far. It is going to be new and fun, but also new and scary. You are going to have experiences that you have never dreamed of having before, like sleeping until 2 p.m. and still being able to get Sunday brunch. You are essentially in a candy shop, and your goal is to take this array of goodies and turn them into something meaningful. In otherwords,  you must find inner peace. Have faith in yourself and what you have done so far to get to this point. Writing a 500-word essay about yourself is the hardest thing you’ll ever have to do other than having two midterms on one day, getting quadded or losing a loved one. You are going to be a very different person going in from the person you’ll be when you leave. For example, you’ll be more used to eating at 3 a.m. even when you’re not hungry. So allow yourself to learn who you are and what you want. Again, congratulations! I’m sure you are all incredible people. I look forward to one of you being the next Bill Gates or even the next ‘me’ [laughs]. Just kidding, there’s only one of me, Oprah Winfrey.
So, even if you feel that going to Harvard is not the path you want to take for your journey into the next four years of your life, please at least find a way to come to the commencement speech, because I’ll be giving out free iPad minis to everyone who attends! Look under your phone receiver right now! It’s a picture of me, Oprah! I put that there!
Don’t forget to join my book club! Beacause you’ll have so much free time to read for fun in college!

Down a dusty highway bordered by sugar cane fields, down a long driveway edged with stately oaks, lies the land that time forgot.
Okay, time hasn’t forgotten it entirely. There are still TVs and cars and iPhones. But in some ways, the place seems to have forgotten about time.
Greenwood Plantation, first erected in 1811, is home to about a thousand acres of land, a portion of the bayou, one (dead) Civil War General, my mother’s best friend, and—at least for the duration of spring break—me.
Around November, when I first began my now-constant bellyaching about the cold, my mother got it in her head to arrange this trip into the heart of rural Louisiana. I saw through her ruse immediately: She just wanted an excuse to gossip with her best friend for a week, most likely leaving me to be devoured by a Louisiana alligator and the hot southern sun. Yet (her) age eventually conquered (my) beauty, and on the Saturday morning after my last midterm, my mother, my sister, several pieces of luggage, and I left New York for Louisiana.
After a rushed connection in Atlanta, I no longer worried about time. We flew like sardines packed in a very small airplane from Atlanta to the  bustling city of Alexandria, Louisiana, with an airport so tiny that all the workers must pitch in when a plane lands, leaving the check-in desks unmanned. Once we landed, it was like the stress receptor in my brain had been switched off. The sky was blue, there was a light breeze, and parts of my body that hadn’t seen light in approximately six months soaked up hot sun. I kept my window open the entire drive to the house, luxuriating in the sight of the just-budding trees and violently blooming azaleas.
At Harvard, it feels as though my every hour is scheduled; I might as well be surgically attached to my phone. Yet at Greenwood, I ceased worrying about time. I actually let my phone run out of battery. Sure, there were a thousand and one things to do on the plantation: Oaks needed to be measured for the Live (pronounced “lahhve”) Oak Society, furniture had to be moved, and errands run. Nobody, however, seemed rushed or hurried, and there was always time to work on your tan (or sunburn). If something didn’t get done, nobody panicked; there was always tomorrow.
One day, we stirred ourselves from our sun-soaked daze to visit family friends, the Parlanges, at their creatively-named plantation, Parlange. Not only is Parlange the oldest plantation in Louisiana and the birthplace of Madame X (the lady featured in John Singer Sargent’s famous portrait, “Madame X”), it is also still a working plantation, which raises cattle and sugarcane. Yet this didn’t stop Brandon Parlange and his mother, Lucy, from giving us a leisurely tour of the house and grounds, and treating us to an absolutely delicious lunch. He seemed, like the rest of the natives, to regard time as more of a guideline than a steadfast rule.
Before I was even off the plane home I felt thrown back into a world arranged around the hour and minute hands. As we sat on the runway, I engaged in a furious text message exchange with a friend over when we would meet for our dinner date. Yet my now laissez-faire attitude towards time allowed me to reschedule rather than subject myself to unnecessary stress. Here’s hoping this outlook lasts longer than my newly acquired southern drawl.

So, you’re a second semester senior. Finally finished with that thesis on the parallels between Doctor Seuss and Freudian romantic ideals, you feel like you’re on top of the world. But what do you do with all of that newfound free time? Here’s the perfect guide to squeezing in a whole semester’s worth of fun, seizing the day, and soaking up Harvard and the vibrant city of Boston before you don your commencement cap in May.
1.  Appreciate those Harvard staples.As you will soon bid farewell to your beloved alma mater, be sure to take advantage of those “classic Harvard” pastimes before it’s too late. Check out a book for (gasp) leisure from one of the libraries. Then perhaps do one of the ubiquitous “three things” in a certain, famous library. Revive the ephemeral “Harvard tanning club” on the Quad lawn. Heck, go to that upstairs nightclub at the Kong. We’re all dying to know what’s up there.
2.  Re-enact “Good Will Hunting.”For a fun evening out, visit classic Boston locales made famous by “Good Will Hunting.” First, take a stroll in Boston Common and sit on that iconic bench where Sean and Will had a heart to heart. Head over to Kelly’s Roast Beef for a delicious sandwich (410 Revere Beach Blv., Revere), and top off the day with a visit to Southie bar L Street Tavern, where Will and Chuckie shared a few beers (658 E 8th St, S. Boston). If you’re a bit less adventurous, just sit and relax outside Au Bon Pain right on Mass Ave—the site of Will and Skylar’s casual coffee date.
3. Relive your childhood.Before you enter the real world, spend an afternoon revisiting the glory days of your youth. Sample the sweets at Sugar Heaven, one of Boston’s best candy stores (669 Boylston St). Relive Mom’s milk and cookies at the Boston Chipyard in Faneuil Hall. Finish the day in an epic laser battle at Laser Quest (1580 VFW Pkwy, West Roxbury). Now that you’ve got all of that out of your system, you can graduate like the sophisticated adult that you are.
4. Check out the local music scene.Forget the House of Blues or TD Garden—Boston is full of small, personal performance venues featuring alternative/indie music scene giants. Hit up the Paradise Rock Club (967 Commonwealth Avenue), the Middle East (472 Mass Ave.), or the Lilypad (1353 Cambridge St.) for a fresh take on Boston’s rich underground scene.
5. Explore.Sometimes sheer spontaneity leads to the best of times. Play “T Roulette” and get off at a random stop with an open mind. You may find your new favorite shop, restaurant, or bar along the way. Just like any good indie band, it’s always better when you discover something for yourself.
Soon, your Harvard experience will be in your rearview mirror as you speed on to an exciting new future. So take advantage of Cambridge and Boston while you still have the chance—you won’t find other college towns like them.

Joseph P. Botinari went to work the day that he died.
He arrived early that Thursday morning, just as he had for the 45 years since he opened Colonial Drug, the drugstore and fine fragrance shop on Brattle Street. After a full day of work, he returned home and suffered a heart attack. His children, who had been working in the store with him for decades, had no second thoughts about what to do the next day. They went in and opened the shop.
“He would have wanted it,” says his son, J.P. Botinari, who is now one of the shop’s owners. “You come to work. That’s what it is. It’s the old drugstore mentality. Back in the day, if you were sick, the doctor called in a prescription. and you delivered it to the patient’s house. Didn’t matter whether it was raining out. Didn’t matter whether there was two feet of snow, like recently. You delivered to the house.”
Kathy G. Botinari, J.P.’s sister and co-owner, remembers the gloom in the shop in the days after her father’s death.
“Suddenly you’re in the store. He’s not here. But his handwriting is everywhere. His way of doing things is everywhere. His customers are coming in asking for him.” One man, upon hearing the news of Botinari’s death, went into the store’s old-fashioned phone booth and cried for two hours. Joe, as he was known, had become a staple of the neighborhood. Back then, before a CVS or Duane Reade had opened on every corner, everyone knew their pharmacist.
“You have to understand. Everybody who was sick went to the drug store. There was no other option,” J.P. says. “They all came to you. They trusted you.”
Joe used to let people take medicine on credit. He claimed he couldn’t sleep at night knowing someone did not have the medication they needed because they couldn’t pay.
“If you’re sick you’re out of work, you can’t be paid,” J.P. says, remembering his dad’s logic. “You take it to get well and you pay me when you can pay it.”
And the dedication Joe showed to his customers was repaid. When one customer’s daughter turned 21, he remembered the generosity Joe had shown his pregnant wife more than two decades before. He sent a letter with a gift card to a local restaurant, requesting that Joe use it to go out to dinner.
In the ’60s, a riotous protest of the Vietnam War erupted in the Square. Demonstrators broke windows and lit trash cans on fire, but Colonial Drug sustained no damage. Reports came the next day that there were voices in the crowd shouting,“Leave Colonial Drug alone.”
“He started Colonial Drug in 1947, which was a total different time,” J.P. says. “Pharmacists mixed medication by hand, putting them in capsules. It wasn’t like, ‘open a bottle and count out pills.’ You concocted different cough medicines or skin creams. They were all mixed in the back.”
J.P. and Kathy honor past practices in other ways, primarily with their emphasis on personalized customer service tailored to meet each person who walks in the door. “You respect everyone that walks through the door,” J.P. says. “Doesn’t matter if they’re gonna respect you back. Doesn’t have anything to do with how their hair is styled, what they’re wearing. Everybody gets treated with respect.”
Sixty-five years later, passing the shop on the street feels like a time warp. A vintage striped awning, red, white, and blue barber shop pole, and cursive neon sign almost transport you instantly. Just storefronts away, the facades of American Apparel and City Sports feel like a different world.
Kathy recalls instances during past Harvard football seasons when she had to call in extra staff because of the influx of business. But the advent of modern drugstores has changed the flow of customers.
“I think a whole generation has grown up now that doesn’t even know what that is—what personalized shopping is,” Kathy says. “It’s a whole different way of shopping and living. It’s a whole different lifestyle.”
Additionally, the store has felt the reverberations of the recent recession as well as the shift to online shopping. Most begrudgingly, J.P. and Kathy have had to deal with “showrooming,” a phenomenon in which customers use J. P. and Kathy’s service and knowledge of the products and then buy the goods online.
“Someone came in the other day and looked up and said, ‘Oh, it’s two dollars cheaper on Amazon,’” Kathy says. “Well, okay...you’ve taken up our time. We’ve shown you the fragrance, it’s our testers, our time, our expertise, our assistance. And we see you with your electrical devices looking it up and talking to your friends, and talking like we’re not even here. You can spend your money everywhere, that’s everyone’s prerogative. How much more can I do?”
Although this changing culture makes business hard, Kathy and J.P. hope to keep the business alive in the near future. “The best thing is to support little businesses, because they’re the future,” Kathy says, wistfully. “Hopefully, they’re the future.”

“So, you take pictures of sunsets too?”
I squinted, lowering my cellphone. Purple flashes from the sun dazzled me, but I could vaguely make out shadowy figures. Slowly the psychedelic swirl resolved itself into a man on a bench. His hair was matted and his skin tan and burnished by the elements over the decades to a soft, wrinkled sheen. He sat, hands on the shoulder straps of his backpack, looking up at me. I shrugged. “Yeah, I guess so.”
We were surrounded by spring breakers, waiting to to catch the shuttle from Fort Lauderdale Airport to the beach and the party that awaited us there. The shuttle was already a half hour late and we were anxious to get going after a day of travel.
A rush of wind as a bus shot past us drowned out what he said next. I cupped my hand to my ear, and yelled “What?!”
“I said my son likes taking photos of sunsets too!” His smile was checkered with gaps.
“Oh.” I glanced back at the sunset framed by the palm trees. “I think most people take pictures of sunsets. I guess they’re just universally considered beautiful.” The sky was growing redder, scattering higher in the atmosphere.
“Yeah, and no sunset is the same, right?”
“Right.” I felt like our perfunctory conversation had reached its end, and turned back around, training my smartphone on the horizon.
“I used to take pictures of bombshells falling.”
I couldn’t help but turn around at his non sequitur.  “What’d you say?”
The man pulled a dog tag out from under his shirt. “I served in ‘Nam, and brought my camera everywhere with me. I got some really close shots in the jungle, and next to villages that were bombed.”
A shuttle rolled up to the curb. People poured out of it bearing suitcases. I started forward, rollaway trailing, but realized it wasn’t the right one. I walked back and cracked my knuckles. The man was still looking at me, expectantly. I didn’t really know how to reply so I said, “That’s not quite the same as taking a picture of a sunset, huh?”
“No, not really. But still, each one was unique. The way it would flash in the light right before it burned. The way the sun burns.”
I wanted to escape this conversation, which was clearly an excuse for this veteran to talk about his war days. Just as the silence became awkward, our shuttle pulled around the corner. I whistled to my friend, who lazily got up off his seat near us. “Well, this is us, we’ve got a cruise to catch, it’s nice to meet you, goodbye.”
I dragged my suitcase onto the shuttle and shoved it into the rack behind the driver. We still had a few hours of travel ahead of us. Out the tinted window, the colors of the sun were muted and the man sat on his bench, smiling at nothing in particular. I had missed, as I always did, the legendary green flash right after the sun vanished beneath the horizon. The clouds still caught the embers, and streaks studded the sky like shrapnel.

The guests arrive in a sea of colors, in dresses ranging from a deep magenta to a pale green that matches the cacti outside. The hot desert sun begins to set as upstairs in the dressing room we huddle around the windows, ducking away behind the curtains and laughing before anyone sees us watching from up above. Our hair and makeup are done, the bride’s dress is expertly laced up, and the purple and white flowers are bound in bouquets. Now all that’s left is waiting.
 
6:25 
We line up just inside of the old oak door, listening as sounds and conversations float up over the sand colored balcony. I’m to walk down first, followed by the three other bridesmaids, the flower girl, and, lastly, the bride herself. The sparkling silver bands on my shoes pinch me as I shift from foot to foot, thinking nervously about how everyone’s eyes will be on me as I walk from the door to the flowered arch. 
 
6:35 
The music starts slowly, softly, as the familiar notes of Sleeping Beauty’s Waltz drift through the air. The wedding coordinator waves me forward. One step after another, I make my way across the balcony. A mantra of “don’t trip, please, just don’t trip” plays in my head as I hold the iron railing for dear life, deliberately placing each foot as I make my way down the stairs. 
 
6:41 
The flower girl peers out of the doorway before shyly making her way down the aisle, nervously clutching her basket and almost forgetting to toss the delicate white rose petals into the air. Her curls bounce and her new white shoes click on the pale stone. She meets us under the arc as the music starts to fade, and the lanterns glow in the soft evening light.
 
6:43 
From the gasps and the pointing of cameras, I know that the bride has taken her first steps. She too walks across the balcony and down the stairs, her face radiant as she holds her father on her right arm and mother on her left. Her long dark hair curls fall past her shoulders, and the train of her dress trails down the aisle.
 
6:46 
Tears roll down her smiling face as she sees her future husband waiting for her. This is my cousin, who only yesterday was playing hide and seek in a circle of trees, and building sandcastles in the Connecticut summer sun. As I watch them both, each only having eyes for the other, tears well up in my eyes as well.

When I saw the octagonal sign hanging on the entryway that said, “STOP: Please Remove Your Shoes Before Entering,” I had a feeling I wasn’t in Cambridge anymore.
 
I unzipped and hesitantly slid off my boots (slightly embarrassed about my fuzzy socks), and pushed open the doors to the gym on the fourth floor of the Malkin Athletic Center. Immediately, a cloud of students clad in what looked like floor-length purple skirts that read “NYU” walked by. Later, I learned that the skirt—a Hakama—is just one part of the whole Kendo uniform, designed to look like the apparel of a Samurai warrior. The gym was crowded, but it seemed that I was one of few unaffiliated spectators, and possibly the only person other than Harvard emergency medical technicians who wasn’t in kendo garb.
 
I was at the Shoryuhai Intercollegiate Kendo Tournament, a Harvard-run Japanese sword fighting tournament and the largest collegiate tournament in the nation. Walking carefully so as not to tread on the bamboo swords or gym bags that were scattered around the bleachers, I climbed to the top row and settled down to watch the match that was about to begin.
 
Two people wearing hakama skirts and white faceless masks circled each other in the middle of a large circle of spectators, their swords raised. Suddenly, there was shouting and the sound of swords clashing against each other; after nine or 10 seconds, there was excited applause and the circle began to disperse.
 
I sat, clueless: What on earth had I just witnessed? 
 
A loudspeaker announcement informed me that it was time for lunch, so I wandered onto the gym floor to get a closer look. As far as I could tell, Harvard fighters were gathered in the farthest corner, set up with pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts and chatting about their morning. Walking up to the nearest people that looked like they might be on the Harvard team, I asked them about their experiences with Kendo sword fighting.
 
Jack F. Weyen ‘16, a member of the team, said the sport is oppositional. “Its all about the mentality of battle,” he said. “You shout to show intent and faith in attack, and then you hit.” According to Weyen, each spot you aim for is one that makes clear your desire to kill your opponent—the throat, wrist, torso, or head.
 
These battles play out between groups of four or five people from each team, in a match lasting anywhere from 10 seconds to two minutes. They end once an attacker gets two “touches.” The singles tournament is much more difficult than the team matches; although it requires less strategic thinking, players say, students face masters of kendo, “dons,” as well as alums and graduate students. Because many undergraduates are beginners, they rarely make it to the finals.
 
For Kathy L. Tran ‘16, a tournament manager, animosity on the field is accompanied by the warmth of the close-knit—if somewhat unknown—kendo community. “No one is doing anything alone here,” she said. “Yet despite the closeness of the team, she continued, “Harvard needs to acknowledge kendo more.”
 
In accordance with the supposed obscurity of the sport, many of the competing students have little or no prior experience with kendo before their freshman year. Some students come to kendo from other sports for a mentally-engaging change in pace. Harrison H. Parker ’16, an ex-fencer, explained that he was looking for a “change of scenery in a combat sport.” For Parker, kendo is a game of both body and mind. “Once you start to understand what’s going on, you have to control the other person,” he said. “Its very psychological.”
 
At the same time, kendo players prize the physical aspects of the sport, too. “Fencing,” Parker said, “is all about getting the touch. [In] kendo, it’s about war points. Is your opponent going to kill you?”
 
Parker’s team members agreed, rolling up their sleeves to expose bruises and welts on their arms from recent matches.
 
As proud as its players were, however, the Harvard Kendo team’s day was already over. No Harvard students had made it to the next round of singles, although Co-Captain Aidan C. de Burgh Daly ’13 had beat NYU during the group matches, pulling through against an opponent many assumed was better than Harvard.
 
The team dispersed to get lunch, and I wandered back through the gym, intrigued—struck, even?—by a slice of this subculture.

II. A More Equal Playing Field
“That’s the first thing I noticed: food around here is really expensive,” says Nelida Garcia ’14.
Garcia, a junior sociology concentrator in Leverett House and the younger daughter of Mexican immigrants, grew up in Humboldt Park, a working class neighborhood in Chicago. As visibly drained dining hall employees in Adams quietly eat their dinners before the evening shift, Garcia, for whom sentences seem to spill out in confident, rapid-fire phrases, tells me about adjusting to Harvard Square during freshman year.
“I actually never had my own room until I came to Harvard,” she says. “The first time I went home for J-Term, suddenly, everything in my house seemed really small. I remember making some remarks to my older sister, and she was just like, ‘What happened to you?’”
Garcia, as with several other students I spoke to, had never originally intended to apply to Harvard. Her older sister, who was the first in her family to attend college and went to the University of Chicago, recommended that she apply to Harvard. Garcia’s family qualified for an application fee waiver, but she recalls that her guidance counselor at her public high school of 4,000 students was initially reluctant to support her application. A week later, Garcia came back to him and mentioned that she was preparing to apply to two more Ivy League schools.
“He just said, ‘Okay, so I see that you’re determined.’”
As with many other students, Garcia’s college decision came down to financial aid; Harvard easily beat out other competitors with its Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI) and need-blind admissions.
HFAI, first announced by former University President Larry Summers in 2004 and implemented in 2006, has enabled students from families with incomes less than $60,000 to enroll with no expected parental contribution. This number was raised to $65,000 in the fall of 2012, and according to the University’s Financial Aid website, families with incomes up to $150,000 are expected to pay 10 percent or less of their income on average. On Tuesday, the University announced an additional $10 million increase in the financial aid budget.
In addition to enabling students who formerly could not afford to attend the College, HFAI has influenced the admissions process. According to “Shoestring Budget Strategies,” an informational booklet for incoming students written by HFAI Student Coordinators during the summers of 2010 and 2011, “Harvard has reemphasized, in the context of its highly personalized admissions process, the policy of taking note of applicants who have remarkable accomplishments despite limited resources at home or in their local schools and communities.”
These adjustments to admissions policies, which help reduce the effects of socioeconomic inequalities outside the College, also complement the various policies and systems in place that seek to reduce the impact that these inequalities have on life within the College. The fact that all students enroll in the same meal plan upon entering the College, for instance, reduces the potentially exclusionary effects of tiered dining options in the Square. Similarly, the Freshman Dean’s Office seeks to limit or entirely remove the question of money when it comes to social events: “We’ve been trying to, in the events that we organize, host as many things as we can that don’t have charges. That’s the spirit behind the SIPs [Student Initiated Programming] and a number of things that we sponsor,” says Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
The Student Events Fund—which is jointly offered by the Financial Aid Office, Harvard Box Office, and the Office of the Dean—was started in 2002 with the assistance of the Undergraduate Council, the fund offers free tickets to qualifying students on financial aid for events ticketed through the Harvard Box Office.
But for all that the College has accomplished to increase socioeconomic diversity over the past few years, the topic of class itself seems to still exist primarily as an intellectual topic more than an openly discussed social reality.
“It’s sort of the elephant in the room,” says Garcia, who is currently enrolled in a junior sociology tutorial taught by lecturer on sociology Rachel Meyer called “Social Class in the United States: Identity, Culture, and Consciousness.” “Harvard doesn’t provide a place for students to talk about class, I feel like.”
III. Class: A Moving Target
Talking about class is difficult not only because the topic is so broad, but also because it can be difficult to know how, or in what terms, to talk about it in the first place.
“One of the problems about class in the U.S. is that we don’t often define class in the U.S.,” says history and literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93. McCarthy mentions that he self-identified as a working class student on financial aid as an undergraduate at Harvard, and that those experiences helped shape his perspectives on the issue of class and social inequality in America. He notes that Harvard is exceptional in many respects, which can lead students to assume that most aspects of their college experience will be exceptional as well.
“Because getting into Harvard opens doors of opportunities for anyone—regardless of your socioeconomic background—I think that there is sometimes a tendency to think that because that door has been opened, there’s something of an equal playing field when you get to Harvard,” he says. “In some cases that may be true, but in other cases it’s absolutely not true.”
Garcia feels similarly, citing her own experience as a self-identified working class, urban student.
“For working class students, I think it’s easy for us to buy into the American Dream—it’s almost dangerous, in a way,” she says. “We should spend more time asking why others didn’t make it, not why we got in.”
Admittance to Harvard, according to Garcia, is at once an opportunity for self-advancement, but also requires people to confront societal limitations for those without such opportunities.
Although the equalization effect at the College does promote socialization across socioeconomic lines, it also obscures the differences in privilege that exist, making these problems perhaps less visible than students like Garcia would prefer. Awkward moments tend to happen when these differences do come—often as a result of inadvertent assumptions made about means or cultural frames of reference.
Katherine, a junior in Pforzheimer who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because she did not want her roommate’s financial status known, describes the northern Californian suburb where she was raised as “very wealthy.” She recalls a moment during her freshman year that made her acutely aware of differences in privilege.
“My roommate at the time asked me, ‘Hey, did you see that email from the Financial Aid Office?’” Katherine wasn’t sure how to bring up the fact that she was not on financial aid. “When she asked me that, I just looked at my shoes.”
Garcia shares a similar story about a friend of hers whose freshman year roommates were discussing which restaurants they hoped to sample during Boston’s Restaurant Week. Her friend simply couldn’t afford to participate in Restaurant Week, but also felt awkward breaking the news to her roommates.
These particular stories are related to a more general story, another problem which adds to the difficulty of discussing class: the perceived stigmatization of not being middle class, which is often conflated with being an average American.
“The thing that surprised me the most was that the people who I’d think of as being rich or upper class thought of themselves as middle class,” says Laura, a senior in Lowell House who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because she did not want her financial status known. “This one person who I will not identify further flew home to California for Columbus Day weekend one year,”—she begins to chuckle—“and I was just, I mean—that was so far out of my lifestyle that I was just like, ‘Oh, okay. ‘Middle class.’”
Laura, who works over 20 hours a week and sometimes up to 40 to support herself, describes herself as having been interested in questions of class for some time. It’s clear that she has strong opinions; she speaks faster than I can take down notes, with balanced, eloquently phrased thoughts that would seem more appropriate in a section for a sociology class than in a casual dining hall interview.
When I mention how little I had talked about class with friends until I began researching this story, she interrupts me to make a comment.
“It’s because—if I can just go off on my own intellectual tangent for like 15 seconds—it’s because Americans aren’t equipped to talk about class,” she argues. “We never have been; we have this myth of the classless society that makes it impossible for us to even admit the existence of class.”
In the same breath, she continues, “We don’t even have the vocabulary, the awareness in our daily conversations, to talk about class. That’s why the people who I went to high school with who are very working class people can claim themselves in the middle class and the children of stockbrokers and doctors and lawyers and professors say that they’re middle class: because we all think we’re middle class.”
What exactly constitutes middle class, with regards to income, level of education, type of job, is debatable. Unlike race or religion, self-identification on the basis of class is less precisely determined because so much of class identity is relative.
Class identity seems to be similarly downplayed at Harvard for reasons of social integration and also financial privacy, but whether or not this approach is most productive is unclear.
IV. Meritocracy
For some, what class means to your identity is directly related to how you feel about meritocracy. Jane Van Galen, a professor of education at the University of Washington, Bothell, whose research interests include social mobility through education for poor and working-class students, points out, “There’s a sense that we’re all middle class when we hear all this political rhetoric. There’s almost a stigma of identifying as working class, but that’s related to an American understanding of being responsible of your own destiny: that if you’re not middle class, then it’s your fault.”
That is, you get only what you earn and therefore deserve. Almost no students I spoke to shared this extreme view of meritocracy, but many identified problems with the assumption that America was becoming increasingly meritocratic.“I think a meritocracy is only valid if everybody starts from the same position, and we do not have a society in which everybody starts from the same positions,” Laura says.
Opinions on the notion of meritocracy as it applies to Harvard admissions influences how students view their own acceptance into the College and subsequent college experience. Haley E. Adams ’15, a cheerful, bright-eyed native of Princeton, Ill., a rural town of about 7,000, grew up on a 20-acre farm, with “a cornfield in our front yard, a bean field in our side yard, a wheat field in our backyard, and a cornfield in our side yard.” Although very few students at her high school applied to colleges out of state—and even fewer to Ivy League universities—Adams was determined to apply to Harvard.
“I truly believe that if you have the will, you can do it,” Adams says. “It’s not easy, but you have to make the admissions officers believe that you have a fire inside you.”
She emphasizes how growing up on the farm affected her worldview; she began working at age 12, picking tassels for corn and other tasks from 5 a.m. to 1 p.m. during the summers. “I learned the value of hard work, and did the most with what I had.”
Other students are more skeptical about the obstacles faced by students applying to Harvard. Nicholas T. Rinehart ’14, a Crimson arts editor who grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and attended the prestigious Dalton School from ages five until 18, was preceded by four generations of Harvard alumni.
“Admissions are not a meritocracy,” he says. “It’s not the pure meritocracy it’s meant to be or will ever be.” Rinehart feels that admittance into an elite college is generally overplayed as proof of individual achievement, and notes that the College has a vested interest in producing a well-rounded class, rather than one with perfect grades. “Some people think that getting into Harvard is a measure of their worth, instead of realizing it as a total, impossible contingency—a total crapshoot,” says Rinehart. “It’s not like the best people always get in.”
But he does acknowledge the ways in which HFAI and other institutional changes have made Harvard more diverse than it had been in generations past.
“I think Harvard hits the mark with regards to socioeconomic and racial diversity; it could be better, it could be worse,” he says.
A distinct topic from the ways in which class inequality outside of Harvard affects admission is the effects of class differences within Harvard. Aside from the obscuring of class differences and the challenges of making useful identifications between lower, middle, and upper classes, another problem about class is that it has both a deeply personal dimension and a broad social dimension.
“It’s personal—you think about your own experience and don’t realize necessarily that your experience is common to a whole group of people,” says Timothy Nelson, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School who teaches a class available to undergraduates called “Class and Culture” which explores class inequality through a discussion-based approach. Another challenge, then, is to balance the attested effects of class on individual experience with distinct, generalizable group experiences that would identify the exclusionary forces in what Laura calls “the myth of a classless society.”
For legacy students, the role of class and familial background can vary.
C. Tucker Pforzheimer ’13-’14, whose shared name with a Quad House is not a coincidence, comes across as exceptionally poised and friendly. At Petsi Pies, he makes small talk with the barista as he orders his coffee, and as he waits for his beverage he clears a used mug from a nearby table. Pforzheimer seems completely open talking about his college experience, and he tells me about his gap year after his sophomore year in high school as well as his gap year after his sophomore year in college. When I ask about the role of class and socioeconomic background in his college experience, though, Pforzheimer hesitates momentarily.
“Once you’re here, I believe that you’re measured by what you’re doing here,” he says, firmly. “Class wasn’t an issue for me—it’s in the background.”
Rinehart agrees that achievement at Harvard is a priority. “Most people think that admissions into Harvard is a confirmation that you did the right things,” he says. “To me, it’s an investment—you have four years here to make it worthwhile.”
Yet the extent to which achievement for different students at Harvard is influenced as a result of socioeconomic differences is still an issue on the minds of students and faculty alike.
“I think that admittance to Harvard is kind of an opportunity to the upper class. When you graduate, you certainly have these opportunities that, no matter what your background, you didn’t have before,” says Nelson. “But that’s different than saying that everything is equal while you’re here, because people bring their backgrounds with them.”
Although the College may have policies in place that limit the role of socioeconomic class in what students can and cannot achieve, the illusion of an equal playing field produced by these policies might be just as problematic as class inequality itself.
“Absolutely there is a perception among a lot of the working students I’ve met and advised over the years that there is a relatively equal playing field because they now have an opportunity to be at a place that is elite,” says McCarthy. “I think for anybody to delude themselves into thinking that Harvard itself does not have all sorts of hierarchies and other social identities would be a problem—or is a problem.”
V. The 21st Century Elite at Harvard
“I was surprised by the class diversity,” Laura says when asked whether her interactions with peers matched the promises of diversity found throughout the Harvard admissions literature. “Maybe it’s because all the rich people keep to themselves, but all my friends are middle class, ranging from very upper-middle class to very lower-middle class.”
“I think there’s a stigma on both ends, for both the lower and upper classes,” says Garcia, pointing out that it might not necessarily be more desirable at Harvard to have inherited a famous name than to have come from modest means. (Most students with names affiliated with Harvard declined to be interviewed for this piece.)
Shamus Khan, an associate professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of “Privilege: The Making of An Adolescent Elite at St. Paul’s School,” distinguishes between entitlement and privilege in his ethnographic study of St. Paul’s, an elite boarding school in Concord, NH. He defines entitlement as a marker of older elite culture (“building their worlds around the ‘right’ breeding, connections, and culture”) and privilege as a marker of the contemporary developing elite (“a sense of self and a mode of interaction that advantage them”). Essentially, he makes the case that it’s less about what wealth and family background you have—who you are—and more about what you’ve accomplished, or at least made it seem like you alone accomplished.
A less obvious leveling force at Harvard is the social convention of “work talk,” which Khan observed at St. Paul’s and which I and countless Crimson op-ed writers have also observed.
“People generate these work narratives that fit within a broader American narrative, which is, ‘You get what you earn,’ rather than what you are, where you’re from,” says Khan, noting the irony that “Work in college has declined by about half since the 1960s; this isn’t just at your average college, but across the board.”
At Harvard College, although many prestigious prep schools and boarding schools are still represented every year in the admissions pool, the majority of students come from public schools. And although many students from elite secondary institutions do tend to hang out together, according to Rinehart, it’s definitely not always the case that they keep to themselves.
“I was surprised I didn’t end up in the New Yorker bubble,” says Rinehart. I ask him to clarify what he means, and he breezily lifts his hand and says, “Oh, you know—Dalton, Collegiate, Horace Mann, Brearley, all those schools.” Although Rinehart was only one of several students I spoke with who attended an elite private school, his experience seemed to corroborate some of Khan’s claims.
“This might sound a little strange, but I came with the expectation that I would feel like I’d always been here, that I’d be comfortable since I knew what the culture was like,” says Rinehart. “What happened was I was incredibly unhappy, alienated, and felt like I couldn’t fit in.”
Although Rinehart says that after about two years he was able to find a niche for himself at the College, there’s no way to tell how representative or not representative his experience is for other legacy students who might sometimes presume, reasonably, that adjusting to Harvard would be easier for them than, say, for first generation college students.
How much socioeconomic diversity is present in elite social organizations within Harvard, an elite institution itself, is also unknown: All eight of the male finals clubs, all four of the female finals clubs, the Hasty Pudding Social Club, and the Signet declined to share statistics about what percentage of their members were on financial aid, generally citing the privacy of their members.
Katherine, the student who confronted her own class identity after a conversation about about whether she received a financial aid email, acknowledges that an upper class stigma may exist for some, but feels that reducing the stigma is a matter of openness. When I ask about whether guilt played into her initial hesitance to tell her roommate about her financial situation, Katherine, reaching across her body with her right arm, says in a hushed voice, “I think it’s a bit like feeling ashamed, but these moments are only uncomfortable if another person makes them uncomfortable.”
VI. An Ongoing Discussion
August A. Dao ’15 is a skinny, soft-spoken chemistry concentrator from Portland, Oregon. The son of Vietnamese immigrants, he tells me over dinner about his life before Harvard with a disarming frankness.
“The neighborhood I grew up in was similar to a ghetto,” he says, noting the preponderance of working class immigrants who attended his high school, including Russians, Thai, Vietnamese, and African refugees. “By the end of my four years in high school, I had witnessed two students deaths and one stabbing. It was a very rough school profile, but I made it here, so I’m happy.”
Dao has been financially independent since his sophomore year of high school, for personal reasons, and stood out at a school whose graduation rate was “around 50 percent,” he tells me.
At the College, Dao works at Harvard Student Agencies in distribution, which he tells me is easy money because he can get work done that is supposed to take two hours in only 45 minutes, and as an HFAI coordinator, helping with outreach and working with students who qualify for HFAI on campus.
During his first semester, Dao struggled with a courseload that proved to be more than he could comfortably handle, and that he knew “never to do that ever again.” When asked about whether he finds it difficult to balance his schoolwork with other commitments like work, he says that because Harvard pays for his entire tuition, the remainder of the costs he’s able to pay for himself. Dao says that class isn’t an obvious issue that affects his interactions with others, and generally hasn’t been an issue.
“If people judge me for that [class background], obviously I don’t care for them,” he says.
I ask Dao whether he would support a student-run organization dedicated to first generation college students, he shifts his eyes from side to side as if I had asked him a trick question. “I...don’t really see the point,” he answers. For Dao, the resources that the College provides for lower-income students and first generation students through the FDO, the Financial Aid Office, and other supportive sectors of the institution are already substantial in themselves.
“I didn’t expect to see people from the same backgrounds as me, but it doesn’t matter socioeconomically where people are from, to me,” he says. When I press him about the idea of a first generation student group, he adds, “I guess what I mean is that people shouldn’t be ashamed of what class they’re from,” noting that he wouldn’t want students from similar backgrounds to segregate if such a group were created.
Although the College has grown more socioeconomically diverse in recent years, how we talk about class seems less clearly to be moving in any particular direction. As Dao suggests, maybe the resources are already in place to enable students to socialize and collaborate across class boundaries; others, like Laura, are less convinced.
“The only way to change our class structure is to talk about it a lot, talk about it enthusiastically, and to talk about it everywhere,” she stresses.
Others agree that a more open and widely promoted discussion would generate progress with regards to class inequalities and differences.
“Let’s make everyone responsible. I don’t think we can have enough of these conversations,” says Van Galen. “I think when we started opening up conversations about gender and race, there had to be an official endorsement for them to be taken seriously; we needed someone to make it safe for the newcomers to talk about it.”
“You have to have opportunities for this to happen,” says Nelson about the ongoing conversation about class. “You have to create structures in which this is possible, and that’s maybe the faculty or the administration or a student group, but it has to be intentional and have the resources, or otherwise it’s not going to happen.”
A single personal essay about class identity, “Choosing the Color of my Collar” by David E. Tebaldi ’10, has been included in the past couple iterations of Community Conversations, a series of required readings for freshmen that are discussed in small students groups led by a faculty moderator. Although Community Conversations has more readings about racial diversity than socioeconomic diversity, the two are distinct topics that are also entangled in many ways; how effective this program is at promoting a discussion on class, however, is disputable. Nelson, who has heard about this program from a number of his students, reports that the response is generally mixed.
“It’s good that they [the FDO] try to do this, although there might be a different point in the process for a more fruitful conversation because you’re dealing with so much [as a freshman] and still just trying to figure out how things work,” he says.
Khan, however, is even more skeptical about what can be accomplished on the level of the individual student at an elite institution.
“Harvard is in an important symbolic position in education, but, in my opinion, there’s still not much Harvard can do,” he says. “I think these problems require broader systemic change, rather than an added program about diversity in freshman orientation, for instance.”
Harvard, as a place of privilege, forces students to address how best to use their privilege. During my conversation with McCarthy, I broke from the routine set of questions to ask a more personal question; having been raised in an affluent suburb of central New Jersey, I couldn’t help but ask for advice: How do you use your privilege so that you can feel okay about what you’re doing, day to day to day?
“I would just advise students to ask themselves, ‘What can I do with my privilege to open doors of opportunity to those who’ve never had those privileges?’” he says.
Khan was less keen to give advice, noting, “I’m not very good with ‘should’ questions—I think of myself as more of a social critic.” But, he did offer a few parting thoughts.
“In writing the book, my hope is that those in privileged positions recognize a bit of themselves in it,” he says. Although it may seem obvious, awareness is the first step.
As Harvard has changed substantially from the days of producing an all-white, all-male American elite, the role that class plays in student life has not diminished, but instead changed in kind. The conversation never stopped; it just changed direction.
“Still,” McCarthy says, “I think class does haunt the place in ways that we don’t always recognize."

“Do you speak Spanish?” asked a voice from the shadows.
 
It is not often that I get a chance to show off my unilingualism, so despite every alarm bell going off in my head, and every scene from Taken flashing before my eyes, I was eager to reply, “Yes.” 
 
It was then that the voice from the shadows tried to con us.
 
I was with a small group of friends in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. We were debating buying a six-pack of bagged sangria when the voice, and the whole man for that matter, entered stage left.
 
He was well dressed and clean-shaven, but he was a little battered looking. His right eye was blackened, giving him the popular “smoky eyes” look, and his hand was swollen, giving him the less popular, but still sexy, “I just broke my fist” look.
 
According to him, though, that is exactly what happened. Upon learning that we knew English, he jumped into his story. He kept a robotic calmness and paused at appropriate times to gain his audience’s sympathy. His pseudo-monologue was well rehearsed, and its script went something like this:
 
He and his 78-year-old father were mugged in a bad part of town. The police were no help, but the Sheraton Hotel was amazing, and got his dad to a hospital. However, for some reason or another, perhaps to hail a cab, he desperately needed six dollars. Ultimately, he gave us his email, and promised to return the cash in full once he made it back home.
 
I was unnerved by the situation. Not so much because I thought he was lying to us— I was more freaked out by the fact that he only asked for six dollars. How could he possibly survive off of this?  What kind of con artist was he? He must have been a beginner. I was almost tempted to give him six dollars and lead him to the nearest Red Box, so he could rent that con artist movie starring Nicholas Cage and develop some better techniques.
 
Then, I saw a pack of Marlboros in his breast pocket and I could not justify donating to his cause. I knew that he would just spend all of the money on cigarettes.
 
We said sorry and he returned to the alley from which he originally emerged. Eventually, we decided to head back home, splitting an overpriced $15 dollar cab ride—finally, some con men who knew what they were doing.

1. Fifteen Minutes: Which three words would you use to describe the housing process? Why?
Joanna G. Miller: A giant puzzle. I say this because the housing process has many many moving and changing pieces (people who decide to return or leave late in the process, people who are uncertain if they’ll return, changing medical circumstances, etc). I am sometimes making housing changes/adjustments right up to move-in day.
2. FM: What, in your opinion, is the most challenging part? Most frustrating? Most rewarding?
JGM: The most challenging part for me is the struggle to get every Winthropian into the best possible housing situation given the needs of students and the reality of the architecture I have to work with. I believe that feeling happy and at home at Harvard and in Winthrop is a very important piece of your time here. The rooming situations available are not “equal,” but there are different things that appeal to different students, so I strive to make the distribution of rooms be (and feel) as fair as possible. The most rewarding part of the process is when students I’ve worked with in difficult situations come back to tell me how happy they are in their rooms.
3. FM: What is it like to work with Harvard students in this capacity? Do you feel as though they make the process easier or more difficult? Or both?
JGM: Without Harvard students there would be no housing, so really there isn’t an easier/harder dichotomy since working with them is the process. For the most part I have found that the students who come to talk to me are very respectful and reasonable. It think that for many of them it helps to hear what issues (more students than spaces in March...upperclassmen make leave and study abroad decisions throughout the spring… and suite configurations that don’t fit the roommate groups coming in to name two) I am dealing with as I try to get them housed.
4. FM: What are your priorities in this process? What is most important for you?
JGM: My priorities in housing are to house every Winthrop student (which is sometimes easier said than done.), to house them in a way that makes Winthrop feel like home, and to make the housing lottery process fair to students. I always want to make decisions that I can back up with a process, not just making one-time exceptions without being able to make the same exceptions for other students in similar circumstances.
5. FM: What can students do to make this process run more smoothly for all involved? Any advice?
JGM: I think the most important thing students can do is to read the lottery rules first. And, then come and talk to me or send me an email with any questions, I am more than happy to explain my reasoning and rationale to any student with concerns. I would also suggest that students think carefully about what their most important priorities in rooming are. Do you want to live with specific people? Or is a certain entryway or room configuration most important? Roommates and friends should discuss candidly what they are looking for in their suite, and in their roommates. There are many instances where people are great friends, but not great roommates because their living styles or schedules are too different. It is much better to have those difficult conversations before you pick a room rather than once you’re living together.

When choosing a restaurant overseas, the fewer English words on the menu, the better. I don't know what it was that I had for lunch that first day in Doha, Qatar, but it was delicious, a mixture of herbs and stewed chicken over rice with fresh flatbread, accompanied by traditional tea. The restaurant's location couldn't have been better either, in the heart of Souq Waqif, a rebuilt open market in the heart of Old Doha. The main walk bustled with tourists, "guest workers," and local Arabs from the Gulf region proudly wearing blinding white thobes and dark black niqabs.
Night, though, brings the souq to life. Despite being rebuilt to primarily serve tourists, the souq is almost completely filled with locals at night, with sounds of traditional music wafting over the stone facades of the shops and restaurants. The traffic outside was hectic, but inside the souq we slowed time down, losing track as we sat in big soft wicker chairs with pots of sweet and spiced tea and a few shisha water pipes between us, the soft glow of their coals warming our shoulders. A breeze always seems to be blowing in Doha, and brings an alternation of the scent of the ocean and the rich perfumes of those walking by.
We watched people sitting, eating, and drinking our tea. We watched the old Qatari men smoking and the younger ones walking around. We watched the skyline flicker and glow, its modernist skyscrapers a distant contrast to the reality in which we had ingrained ourselves.
We spent three nights there, sitting on the rooftops of various cafes. We talked for hours about the Middle East, the U.S., and asked all the questions about Qatar that we never had the chance to ask before of our friends and hosts. It was, in some ways, like living life in an escapist fairy tale, while at the same time being in the middle of one of the world's fastest-growing countries. As the coals flickered and were quickly replaced, we ordered another round of tea to prolong our evening until finally the restaurant had to close in the wee hours of the morning, and the troupe of American guests headed back out for a walk along the waterfront to our hotel.

Some students are natural early-risers who awaken at dawn. Others are night owls who never hit their mattresses earlier than 2 a.m. Both types of students will miss out on a time of day that could have much to offer. What happens on campus in the wee hours of the morning: the twilight times post 2 a.m. and the rosy sunrise hours around 6 a.m.? FM investigates.
 
Late Night: 2:16 a.m.- Mia L. Sobin  
Walking outside, I feel like I’m interrupting the stillness that has settled over Harvard Yard. Moonlight wraps around the edges of each dorm, and, squinting, I can make out a HUPD officer leaning against her car.
I weave through the paths of the Yard and approach her, asking about working the night shift in Harvard Yard. She tells me that the shift offers a much quieter perspective on student life: “Weeknights, they’re not busy at all,” she explains. “Weekends, it’s usually busy, from 11 o’clock at night until 4 in the morning, when students are walking back to their dorms.”
She’s right—as I trudge onward and pass through Boylston Gates, I am confronted suddenly by packs of loud, belligerent pedestrians. Hello, Saturday night. A man in a black pea coat stumbles towards me, clutching his iPhone, asking, “Where is Hong Kong? Just point me in the direction.” After assuring him that The Kong is merely two blocks away, I continue along my journey, passing JP Licks (two hours too late for a Coffee Oreo with sprinkles) and countless inebriated passersby.
As I walk down Mt. Auburn Street I approach the new, late night food addition to the square: Insomnia Cookies. A few men, fervently holding on to several Chocolate Chunk cookies, crowd by the bright window looking onto the street. I head up to the front desk, asking the guy that works behind the counter about a typical night on the job.
“Yeah, there’s a rush at 11pm, and then again at 1:30,” he answers. “Its usually just typical drunk people. Nothin’ too crazy. Except I had two old ladies come on St. Patty’s day--totally obliterated. That was crazy.” He goes on to describe how Insomnia disposes of their leftover cookies: he takes all the excess home himself.
Back outside, despite the occasional shout or jeer, the Square feels eerily peaceful, removed from its everyday bustle. Students and locals roam together in search of a good time, content in their states of mutual intoxication.
In a way, this typical Saturday night felt almost calming, offering an appreciated—but noisy—break from the rush and stress of the week. Heading home to the Yard and climbing into bed I feel at ease, contented, sleepy, pleased with my late-night explorations, and, most of all, eager to sleep in until Sunday brunch.
Early Mornings: 6:32 a.m.- Josh J. Friedman 
It is chilly; the sun still hides behind gray clouds.  I expect to see nothing more than my own reflection on the street, but surprisingly I am not alone. Students, locals, and even tourists wander through the Yard, experiencing the beauty of a relatively calm Harvard campus.
As I begin exploring early morning campus beyond the Yard, I realize that some students have experienced the pre-8:30 a.m. morning for their entire time here at Harvard.  Many of them are athletes. I spot a few members of the Men’s Rowing team exiting their dorms and heading towards the river for practice. I rush after them.
Though at first the idea of waking up early for a team practice seems terrifying, the co-captain of the lightweight rowing team Matt O’Leary ‘13 assures me of the benefits of wakeful early mornings.  “The biggest difference for us is the river…there are far fewer boats on the water, and there is usually less wind than in the rest of the day,” he explains. I am not convinced.
But O’Leary loves his sport and continues to gush.   “Getting to row on flat water completely validates the effort of getting out of bed so early,” he insists. “There is something very enjoyable about being up and getting to work while most of campus is still asleep.”
As I continue to wander around predominantly closed stores and lifeless dorms, Harvard Square feels strangely quiet. A steady flow of traffic begins to emerge, and as the morning continues more and more students seem to be walking about.
I stop Currier senior Max W. Sabor ‘13 on the street, and he says he is often among the brave cohort of students who regularly wake up to participate in the early college world. Sabor works at the Boston Arts Academy through the Harvard Undergraduate Teacher Education Program and generally wakes up at 6:20 a.m. to arrive at school for his day of student teaching around 7:30 a.m. Although Sabor finds teaching to be meaningful and rewarding, he says he has “to restrain (himself) from being tempted by (his) roommates and other late-night activities,” so that he has enough energy to work each morning.
After experiencing the calm and quiet beauty of a Harvard morning, I make one more stop on my early morning adventure: breakfast at Zinnekens for home-made Belgian waffles. A morning began with miserable groans and harsh alarm has reached a perfect, sugar-loaded end. I soak it in. Then, I head back to bed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prolonged exposure to a stimulating environment may help in delaying one of the factors associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, according to a new study by researchers at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
The study, which was published in the March 6 issue of Neuron, tested the impact of environment on the memory of mice.
Researchers discovered that positive stimulation by an enriching environment activated specific adrenalin-related receptors in the brains of mice. This in turn prevented the amyloid beta protein, a macromolecule which tends to weaken the signaling between neurons, from damaging communication between nerve cells associated with memory function in the brain’s hippocampus. Because of this, memory was less impaired.
The amyloid beta protein functions the same way in the brains of humans and mice. Thus, according to Shaomon Li, assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and the study’s lead author, the research may have strong implications on the humans experience with Alzheimer’s disease.
“This suggests that if we can have more brain activity, we can prevent or delay the Alzheimer disease onset,” Li said.
The findings could possibly help to weaken a person’s likelihood of getting Alzheimer’s disease, now the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. Though Alzheimer’s disease has no known cure, such research may also impact the treatment available for the large population of people currently suffering from the form of dementia, including an estimated 5.2 million individuals of all ages in the United States, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.
Previous research has named physical exercise, intellectual stimulation, and social experience as factors which could reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
The new study suggests that forms of mental stimulation in an enriched environment, particularly in an educational context, may also contribute the positive effect of increased brain activity.
Currently, Li is continuing the research to examine whether agonists, substances which imitate the functioning of natural chemicals, may be able to mimic an enriched environment and thus artificially produce the same cognitive benefits in memory as a naturally enriched environment.

Using poetry to recount his experience with bipolar disorder, Hakeem A. Rahim ’02 inaugurated a night of panel discussions on mental illness at Harvard that took place in Sever Hall on Wednesday evening.
“I had to have faith that resurrection was possible,” Rahim recited in a poem.
Sponsored by the Black Men’s Forum, the Black Students Association, and the Student Mental Health Liaisons, the event, which took place in Sever Hall, featured speakers from many of Harvard’s counseling services.
Fadhal A. Moore ’15, a member of the BMF and one of the organizers of the panel series, explained that the event was meant to help demystify the issue of mental health on campus.
“Our lives are hard and we do need each other,” Moore said, stating that a frank dialogue about mental illness is crucial to the well-being of many Harvard students.
Rahim, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during his sophomore year at Harvard, shared the experience of his illness, diagnosis, and treatment.
Rahim explained that the efficient provision of psychological and psychiatric treatment and an environment that facilitates a patient’s acceptance of mental illness are both essential to the process of healing.
“Leave here knowing that sharing your struggles in a safe and affirming space is not only cathartic, but also life-changing,” he said.
Frank J. McNamara, counselor at the Bureau of Study Counsel, discussed some of the most common mental health issues that Harvard students have to grapple with, specifically citing the performance anxiety that results from living in a very competitive environment. He urged the audience to be aware of the benefits of psychotherapy.
Members of the audience asked the panelists about rumors that students seeking counseling at Harvard are occasionally pressured into temporarily withdrawing from the College.
“I did not experience any pressure. I chose to take time off,” said Rahim, who temporarily withdrew from his studies twice during his time at Harvard.
Rahim added that he did have to write to the Administrative Board to petition for readmission in both cases, but he called the process “a formality.”
Mental Health Services clinician Melanie Northrop told the audience that far less than one percent of students seeking help at MHS ever take time off from the College, and that no students are ever pressured into doing so.
However, Northrop did state that taking time off might not always be a bad thing when mental health is involved.
“What might be understood as pressure is often actually encouragement to take time to care of yourself and build your resilience,” she said.

After leaving the White House earlier this month, former Director of Speechwriting Jon Favreau reflected on his eight years of working with President Barack Obama at the Institute of Politics Wednesday night.
In conversation with David Gergen, the director of the Center for Public Leadership, Favreau detailed the development of his relationship with the president, beginning with Obama’s opposition to having his own speechwriter.
At their first meeting, Favreau recalled Obama saying, “My adviser tells me I need a speechwriter. I don’t think I do, but you seem nice enough, so let’s give it a try.”
Through that decision, Favreau became the youngest person to ever hold the position.
The event featured clips of speeches throughout Favreau’s tenure, including President Obama’s 2008 Jefferson Jackson campaign speech, his speech after losing the New Hampshire primary to Hillary Clinton, and his first and second inaugural addresses.
After each clip, Favreau shared the inspiration behind each speech.
“What makes a speech work is telling a story from beginning to end. It’s a narrative that holds throughout the entire speech,” Favreau said.
Victoria E. Wenger ’14, vice president of the IOP, said she admires the rhetoric of Obama’s speeches.
“The way this president has been able to galvanize a nation through words and knowing that Jon Favreau has written a lot of those words is fascinating,” Wenger said.
Favreau explained the collaboration process between him and the president, sometimes writing based off an outline and other times serving as an editor.
Sean Weller, a prospective student from Colorado Springs, Colo., was interested in hearing about actual process of speechwriting, having seen it dramatized on the television drama, “The West Wing.”
“You see the intensity that goes into making every word perfect,” Weller said.
After leaving the White House, Favreau started his own private communications firm and plans to write a screenplay based on his speechwriting experiences.
“I think going back into my own writing will be an interesting challenge,” Favreau said. “The way I write will always be a sort of shadow on the way [Obama] writes. Not as good, but an echo.”
With thoughts towards the future, Favreau said he knows his tenure in the White House will have a lasting impact.
“I’m not sure what I’ll do from here on out, but I’m sure that this will have been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life,” he said.

A group of students, many of whom are affiliated with Divest Harvard—a campaign calling on the University to divest from fossil fuel companies—are encouraging students to vote for U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey in the state’s upcoming primaries for the U.S. Senate race. The students, joining a statewide campaign to elect Markey called Vote No KXL, say they support Markey because he is the only candidate in the race who does not support the extension of the Keystone pipeline.
“Vote No KXL gives us an opportunity to pivot our energy off campus to politicians and creates networks between schools all across the state,” said Alli J. Welton ’15, a member of Divest Harvard and an active protester against the extension. On Monday, a group of students stood outside Annenberg to encourage freshmen to sign up to vote “No KXL, vote Markey.”
The students say the Keystone Pipeline, a multi-billion dollar project that would carry 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast refineries, would include increased carbon dioxide emissions from crude oil and the possibility of spills. The Vote No KXL campaign is supported by 350 Action—the political action arm of the environmental activist group 350.org.
“We are letting people know about the upcoming election, getting them registered to vote, and hopefully getting people to sign on to pledge No KXL,” 350.org representative Forrest F. Carroll said of the campaign.
350.org, an organization founded by environmental activist Bill E. McKibben ’82, a former Crimson president, has worked with students in numerous other schools in the Boston area including MIT, Tufts, Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern University to encourage students to pledge.
“We are using this campaign as much as possible to get environmental issues on everybody’s mind,” Carroll said.
According to Carroll, “We expect a very low turnout this election so every vote counts much more. A lot of students at other schools don’t know that they can vote in this election.”
On Monday, students had collected over 30 signatures and will continue to campaign until April 10, which is the last day to register to vote.
“It’s an important issue, and I want to be able to give time to that and make a difference,” said Taonga R. Leslie ’15, a student working on rallying support for No KXL.

In response to statistics revealing gender skew in Harvard Law School clubs and classrooms, a new coalition called Shatter the Ceiling has drawn hundreds of students together to seek new ways to address the School’s gender disparities.
Over 275 students attended the organization’s kick-off event earlier this month, and a solidarity letter outlining the coalition’s goals has garnered approximately 300 signatures. Signers include Law School professors Robert H. Mnookin and Duncan Kennedy as well as several clubs such as the Democrats, the American Constitution Society, and the Harvard Association for Law and Business.
The primary goal of the coalition is to engage the entire Law School community to question the source of the disparities and find solutions to mitigate them, said Lena M. Silver, a third-year Law School student and the co-chair of Shatter the Ceiling.
In an opinion piece published in the Harvard Law Record, Silver cited several statistics that prompted her to found the coalition. She noted that female faculty members represent less than 20 percent of the 92 current professors and assistant professors listed on the Law School website. She also cited the low number of female staff members at the Harvard Law Review, which spurred a new gender-based affirmative action policy to be implemented at the journal this summer.
First-year Law School student Jessica R. Jensen, who attended the coalition’s first open meeting on Wednesday night, said she has noticed a large gender disparity on campus.
“It seems like there are a lot of clubs that have a very large percentage of male leadership, especially in law journals and organizations that lead into academia, which is already a very male dominated field,” Jensen said.
The coalition’s leaders hope to gain access to more data in an attempt to identify the source of the issue. In particular, they want to obtain an update on old numbers cited in a 2004 study on the experiences of women at Law School.
“We feel like we have a right to it, and we will work hard to get it,” Silver said.
At this point in time, coalition leaders have made no concrete demands on administrators because they are still developing their plan, Silver said.
At Wednesday’s meeting, attendees discussed the possibility of asking for a change in the way that first-year Law School students are assigned professors. Currently, the Law School Registrar’s Office tries to assign all students to at least one class taught by a female faculty member during their first year at the Law School, according to Ellen M. Cosgrove, dean of students at the Law School. But the coalition hopes to pressure administrators to ensure that this exposure to a female faculty member occurs even earlier—during a student’s first semester at the Law School.
Attendees also proposed asking administrators to conduct a study examining the effect of gender on classroom participation.
Cosgrove said that she is “delighted” by the group’s establishment and is willing to discuss ways of working together.
“Regardless of whether or not the group exists, it’s something the School is always mindful of and thinks about when we’re making any sort of plans,” Cosgrove said.
Second-year Law School student Jean N. Ripley, the other co-chair of the coalition, said that although the general reaction to the new organization has been positive, it has spurred debate on campus.
“Having backlash is better than being ignored,” she said.

Thomas M. Menino, Boston mayor since 1993, will announce Thursday afternoon that he will not seek a sixth term, multiple news outlets reported Wednesday night, citing sources familiar with the decision. The news was first reported by freelance journalist David S. Bernstein.
Menino, 70, will depart after serving as mayor for 20 years.
Much of his last term was punctuated by lengthy hospital visits. Most recently, he spent over two months in the hospital from October to December and was eventually diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, blood clots, a respiratory infection, and a broken vertebra.
Even so, Menino would have likely succeeded in defending his office had he sought reelection. In a 2009 poll of adult Bostonians, 57 percent of respondents said they had personally met Menino, and in five mayoral elections he has never won by less than 10 percent of the vote.
His current approval rating, according to a Boston Globe poll conducted this month, is 74 percent.
John R. Connolly ’95, an at-large Boston city councillor, is the only major candidate to have entered the race thus far. In the recent Globe poll, which asked respondents who they would support in a head-to-head contest, 21 percent of respondents said they would vote for Connolly, while 50 percent backed Menino.
In an email sent to supporters after it was confirmed that Menino would not be running for reelection, Connolly thanked Menino for his service to the city.
“We need to have an informed debate and discussion about Boston’s future and the many challenges facing Boston,” Connolly wrote in the email, “but today is not that day. Today is a day to thank a great man for being a great Mayor.”
Raised in the Readville neighborhood of Hyde Park, Menino entered politics in 1983 when he won election to the Boston City Council.
In 1993, he became president of the Council and, when then-Mayor Ray Flynn was appointed ambassador to the Holy See, Menino was elevated to the mayoralty.
In the mayoral election in the fall of that year, Menino won his first election for mayor with 64 percent of the vote.
In the twenty years since, Menino has prioritized equal access to education, affordable housing, enforcement of gun laws, and Boston’s “green revolution.”
November 5, 2013, will feature the first mayoral election since 1991 that does not include, in his own words, “Tommy Menino from Hyde Park.” Menino’s term will expire in early 2014.

Tyga will headline this year’s Yardfest, according to an official announcement made by the College Events Board Wednesday evening nearly 20 hours after two students preemptively revealed the artist.
The California-based rapper, whose stage name is an acronym for Thank You God Always, is known for his hits “Rack City,” “Faded,” and “Far Away.”
Students had been speculating about the selection for months. Two Kirkland sophomores—Kendall L. Sherman ’15 and Balaji Pandian ’15, an inactive Crimson IT editor—effectively ended the suspense early Wednesday morning when they wrote a computer program that uncovered a promotional image of Tyga on www.yardfest.org, a website set up by the College Events Board to reveal the headliner at 8 p.m. Wednesday night.
Student organizers from the College Events Board and the Harvard College Concert Commission have been planning the event—a College-wide concert in Tercentenary Theatre every spring—since last term.
In the fall, an email survey to students solicited preferences for Yardfest performers, according to Jeremy M. Tchack ’15, a member of the Harvard Concert Commission.
“The results showed pretty conclusively that the students were looking for an artist who had released Top 40 hits, which helped to give us direction,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Although Tchack acknowledged that Tyga may not have been a first choice for some students, he said he still thinks students will enjoy the performance.
“My prediction: the Yard will go wild when ‘Rack City’ comes on,” Tchack wrote.
The song—known for its explicit language—is Tyga’s biggest hit.
“I’m excited,” said Linda Zhang ’15. “I don’t really support the lyrics, but I think it’s a step up from last year.”
Nevertheless, not everyone at Harvard is familiar with the artist.
“I have no idea who [Tyga] is,” Carolyn S. M. Stein ’13 said.
Last year, Yardfest performers included hip-hop duo The Cataracs, now broken-up group Das Racist, mash-up artist 3LAU, and student band The Nostalgics.
Following the concert, many students said they were dissatisfied with these choices.
According to student planners, artist availability—and to a greater extent, budget—restrict the field of potential performers.
“We know we can’t find an artist that everyone would like,” said Jennifer A. Klein ’14, a member of the Harvard Concert Commission. “We try to do the best we can with the resources given by the College.”
Two student groups—The Cantab Cowboys and Puttanesca—will also perform at Yardfest.

UPDATED: March 29, 2013, at 5:57 a.m.
The Cambridge Police Department received a false report of bombs at the Holyoke Center early Thursday morning, authorities said.
After the report came in at about 4:50 a.m., police descended on the Holyoke Center and conducted a search that turned up nothing, leading authorities to conclude that the building was safe, the Harvard University Police Department wrote in a community advisory sent out at 7:35 a.m. University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said at 8:30 a.m. that “all indications are that this was a hoax,” and that HUPD sent the advisory “to err on the side of heightened vigilance on campus.”
CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello wrote in an email that the officers spoke with the building’s 24-hour security staff and conducted a “sweep and assessment” of the area.
“Officers observed nothing out of the ordinary and the scene was cleared once it was established that there was no threat to public safety,” Riviello wrote, adding that the investigation is ongoing.
A University official told The Crimson that at the early hour the threat was made, there are typically security guards, cleaning crews, and a small group of urgent care personnel at Harvard University Health Services, which is located at the south end of the Holyoke Center. The building is located at 1350 Mass. Ave.
The advisory email encouraged community members to call HUPD at 617-495-1212 to report anything “that seems out of place or out of the ordinary” on Thursday.
“Incidents such as these are a reminder that public safety is at its highest when we all remain vigilant,” the email said.

The five men vying to replace Secretary of State John F. Kerry in the U.S. Senate traded jabs Wednesday night at WCVB-TV studios in Needham, Mass., in the first televised debates of the campaign.
After each of a trio of Republicans—State Rep. Daniel B. Winslow, former U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan, and former Navy Seal Gabriel E. Gomez—attempted to distinguish himself as the least unknown of the group, sparks flew in the second debate as U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch fought to establish position in a Democratic race that many polls suggest will go to U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey.
The most contentious issue of the Democratic debate was the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the massive 2010 health care law which Markey supported and Lynch voted against.
Calling his support of the bill “the proudest vote of my career,” Markey hammered Lynch for voting nay. “Steve, when that vote came up, you were wrong when you were needed most,” he said.
But Lynch pushed back. Suggesting that the negotiations behind the health care law cast American patients as “hostages” to insurance companies, he lamented that Congress allowed insurance and medical corporations to acquire millions of new customers without lowering their prices.
“Now we’re in a tough spot,” Lynch said to Markey, citing the belief among some that parts of the bill, including a sales tax on medical devices, are flawed. “You’re supporting the repeal of sections of an act that you voted for.” Markey countered that he would only repeal aspects of the bill if doing so would not hurt the lower and middle classes. Lynch said he “would vote to fix” the bill rather than repealing it.
Despite his fluctuating record on the issue, Lynch took the offensive when the conversation turned to abortion. “You actually supported an amendment to overturn Roe v. Wade,” he reminded Markey, who voted to ban the procedure before changing his position in 1983.
In contrast, the GOP debate featured few such engagements. Gomez epitomized the less combative tone when, given an opportunity to ask a question of his Republican opponents, he instead chose to ask a rhetorical question of Markey and Lynch, who had not yet debated and were not in the studio. “I’m not here to ask questions of my fellow candidates to try to tear them up or put them on the spot,” he said.
Bringing the crowd and the candidates to laughter, moderator R. D. Sahl gave Gomez a friendly reminder.  “You have to run against these fellows first,” he said.
The GOP candidates’ discussion of same-sex marriage proved testier. When Gomez and Sullivan delivered nearly identical answers supporting same-sex marriage and the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act but essentially delegating the issue to the states, Winslow pounced.
“I think that this goes to the core values of who we are, equality and freedom,” he said. “Mr. Sullivan wants to have government intrude into the personal lives of people, something that is so personal: who they can get married to. I disagree with that.”
The debates were presented by the Boston Media Consortium. The Republican candidates will debate again Thursday in Springfield, and the Democrats will also debate in Springfield on April 18. Both parties will choose their nominees in closed primaries on April 30, to be followed by a special election on June 25.

Thanks to a new partnership between the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard and Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation, scientists will soon be able to simulate human organs outside of the body using live cells—a technique that could revolutionize drug testing.
The Wyss Institute announced last week that it will collaborate with Sony to market the Organ-on-a-Chip, a device that integrates computer manufacture technology and biological principles to recreate organs.
First presented by the Wyss Institute in the publication Science in 2010, the chip is the size of a computer memory stick and features a micro channel lined with living cells from a single organ. The cell channel is stretched and compressed on each side by parallel, flexible air channels. These allow researchers to create cell environments more realistic than those developed in prior studies.
“In the past you put cells in a static culture dish and you’re done. Well, cells in the body don’t really function like that: they’re in dynamic systems, they experience mechanical forces like flow and shear, and our microfluidic techniques allow us to do that,” said Geraldine A. Hamilton, a senior staff scientist at the Wyss Institute. “We provide an environment that gives [the cells] the right cues and tell the cells how to function.”
Led by Wyss Institute founding director Donald E. Ingber, a team of researchers harnessed “techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to manufacture very small and very fine, precise features,” Hamilton said.
Because the functioning portion of the device is so small, relatively few cells are needed to construct a chip, making its production quick and inexpensive. This collection of cells could reduce the need for animal drug testing by recreating human systems on a small scale. Such environments would allow researchers to obtain accurate results related to human drug responses more effectively and safely, Hamilton said.
“We’re moving towards linking multiple organ systems together—moving towards a human body on a chip,” she added. “Because when you take a drug, its efficacy and its safety depend not just on one organ; the entire body is working together.” So far, the research team has developed organs-on-chips for the liver, heart, kidney, bone marrow, lungs, and gut.
“This is a game-changing technology. It will really require a company or organization that is going to take an entirely new approach to get this technology into the market,” said Hamilton. She added that the Wyss Institute is planning on spinning out a company to sell organs-on-chips and other instrumentation to pharmaceutical companies.
Ingber emphasized the importance of partnerships between industry and academia action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to a new study released by the Harvard School of Public Health, tobacco companies have circumvented the Federal Drug Administration’s ban on the use of words which misleadingly indicate reduced risk in the marketing of cigarettes.
The study, which appears in the March issue of the journal Tobacco Control, asserts that tobacco companies have continued to implicitly market certain cigarettes as “light” or “mild” by using colored packages recognizable to smokers.
The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act made illegal the common practice among tobacco companies of giving “light” and “ulra-light” designations to cigarettes which allowed air to mix with smoke before being inhaled.
The 2007 Supreme Court case Philip Morris USA, Inc. vs. Williams declared that these cigarettes were no less harmful than their “full-bodied” alternatives because smokers overcompensated by smoking these cigarettes more frequently and more intensely.
HSPH professor Gregory N. Connolly, the director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control and the study’s lead author, called the outlawed practice the “deadliest consumer fraud in United States history.”
Philip Morris issued labels on Marlboro light packages before the law, which would make “light” cigarettes indistinguishable from the rest of the company’s brands, took effect in 2009.
The labels, printed in all capital letters, read “Your Marlboro Lights Pack is changing / But your cigarette stays the same / In the future, ask for ‘Marlboro in the Gold Pack.’”
Phillip Morris and other cigarette manufacturers changed the color-coding of their packages without waiting for the required consent of the Food and Drug Administration.
For example, Marlboro “light” cigarettes were given gold packaging, and “basic ultra-light” cigarettes could be found in blue and “mediums” in red.
Connolly argued that this problem is endemic in the tobacco industry.
He said the FDA currently holds thousands of “substantial equivalency” requests, in which tobacco companies claim that the new color-coding does not constitute a new product, allowing them to be released without premarket testing by the FDA.
However, Connolly stated that these products are already illegally being sold.
“The FDA is sitting on 3,362 applications from tobacco companies for substantial equivalency and not one of them has been reconciled,” Connolly said.
Connolly intends to petition the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office as well as the FDA and members of Congress with his findings.
The legal thrust of Connolly’s petitions will focus on the tobacco company’s  violation of the “substantial equivalency” section of FSPTCA.
Connolly said that the publication of his study will lend salience to his petitions. Representatives from Philip Morris declined to comment for this article.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 29, 2013, at 5:40 a.m. 
For the seventh consecutive year, a record low percentage of applicants received offers of admission to Harvard College. A total of 5.8 percent of 35,023 applicants were admitted to the Class of 2017, the University announced Thursday.
At 5 p.m., the University sent emails to the 1,134 regular applicants receiving offers. Taking into account the 895 students admitted to the class through the early action program, 2,029 students were admitted this year.
The admit rate for applicants considered under regular decision, including the 3,196 early action candidates who were deferred to regular decision, was 3.4 percent, down from last year’s rate of 3.8 percent. 18 percent of students who applied early action were accepted in December.
“The fact that we agreed to be spending $10 million more on financial aid this year has certainly caught people’s attention,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson, citing what he said was one of many forces driving the large number of applicants. “It’s proof that we meant what we said: that we’re going to diversify Harvard economically and be reaching out to people from a wider range of backgrounds.”
Harvard recently announced a 5.8 percent increase in its financial aid budget for the 2013-2014 academic year, providing a record $182 million to make Harvard more accessible and affordable for students.
Fitzsimmons described the diversity in the pool of this year’s admitted students as an “encouraging” reflection of progress. Of the students offered admission to the class, 19.9 percent are Asian-American, 11.5 are percent African-American, 11.5 percent are Latino, 2.2 percent are Native American, and 0.5 percent are Native Hawaiian. Fitzsimmons said that institutions of higher education have a responsibility to educate a diverse set of future leaders.
“If you’re not able to, and again this is what we’re doing now, to reach out to the most outstanding Latino students in the country...you won’t be educating the future leaders of America,” said Fitzsimmons, explaining the importance of reaching out to high-ability students within all minority groups.
Foreign citizens, U.S. dual citizens, and U.S. permanent residents make up over 20 percent of the class and represent 81 countries.
Fitzsimmons responded to recent reports claiming that selective schools fail to attract high-achieving, low-income students.
“No one’s being left out who has a chance of getting in,” he said of the situation at Harvard. The issue is not reaching these high-ability students who come from low-income families, but in getting them to agree to enroll at educational institutions like Harvard after high school, he argued.
The College did not share the number of students placed on Harvard’s waitlist for the class of 2017.
Fitzsimmons said that although numbers vary from year to year, Harvard has offered admission to anywhere from zero to 228 wait-listed students in recent years.
Selective schools across the nation saw similar declines in the acceptance rates this year. Seven of the eight Ivy League schools reported lower acceptance rates.
Following behind Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Princeton Universities saw 6.7, 6.8, and 7.3 percent acceptance rates, respectively. Dartmouth College admitted roughly 10 percent of applicants, an increase from last year’s 9.4 percent acceptance rate.

CORRECTIONS: March 29, 2013
An earlier version of this article and an email news alert disseminating this article incorrectly stated that a record low number of applicants received offers of admission to Harvard College. In fact, a record low percentage of applicants were admitted to the Class of 2017. The article and the news alert also misstated the time that Harvard sent out its admission decision emails. In fact, those emails went out at 5 p.m., not 5:30 p.m. In addition, the caption of the photo accompanying this article incorrectly stated the number of rejection letters that were sent out by Harvard's admissions office.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was no doubt that a Harvard men’s basketball player would earn Athlete of the Week honors after the team’s historic 68-62 upset of New Mexico in the NCAA tournament on Thursday. With Laurent Rivard taking home the top honors, here are some of the other athletes with great performances from this past week, including three more men from the basketball squad.
Peregrine Badger, Fencing
Badger took home first-team All-American honors at the NCAA Fencing Championships this past weekend after earning a bronze medal.  The sophomore helped lead the men’s fencing team to 75 overall victories this weekend at the national championship.
Sean Poppen, Men's Baseball
The freshman threw a complete game three-hitter and struck out three batters while only allowing one run to earn his first career victory for Harvard as the Crimson beat Houston Baptists, 6-1. Earlier in the week, Poppen worked a scoreless inning of relief with one strikeout while allowing one hit.
Kenyatta Smith, Men's Basketball
Matched-up against seven-footer Alex Kirk, Smith provided a much needed post presence on his way to 10 points and a team-high seven rebounds in Harvard’s win over New Mexico in the NCAA tournament. The sophomore followed Thursday’s performance by leading the Crimson in points with 10 in its loss to Arizona on Saturday in the Round of 32.
 
Victoria Lippert, Women's Basketball
The senior had a team-high 19 points in the Harvard Women’s Basketball team’s 61-57 first round win over Hartford in the WNIT.  Lippert added another 15 points in the Crimson’s 82-72 second round loss to Drexel in the WNIT.
Siyani Chambers, Men's Basketball
Chambers helped pace the Crimson offense against New Mexico on Thursday tallying five points and a team-high seven assists. On Saturday against Arizona, Chambers finished with six points, three assists, and a chipped tooth for his efforts.
Wesley Saunders, Basketball
The sophomore had a team-high 18 points to lead Harvard past the No. 3 seeded New Mexico Lobos in the second round on the NCAA Tournament. In the Crimson’s third round game against Arizona, Saunders finished with eight points, five rebounds, and five assists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team struggled in its home opener on a cold Wednesday afternoon, falling to Holy Cross by a 9-4 margin at O’Donnell Field.
The Crimson (3-14) came into the game riding its first set of back-to-back wins on the season, having beat Houston Baptist twice. The Crusaders (6-13) have been playing solid ball as of late, beating Yale in four straight games last weekend after starting the season poorly.
“We didn’t pitch well, we didn’t hit well, and we didn’t play well,” Harvard coach Bill Decker said. “The disappointing thing is that we didn’t play with the energy that we need to play with to win.”
Although Harvard went down big early, the team fought back in later innings. The Crimson looked as if it might be able to put itself back in the game in the seventh, but its efforts proved to be too little, too late.
Trailing 9-1 in the seventh frame, Harvard junior infielder Carlton Bailey notched a double that drove in sophomore infielder Nick Saathoff. After advancing to third on a groundout, Bailey scored on a double by sophomore outfielder Mike Martin. A triple from sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel that went deep into right-center field would then drive in Martin to bring the Crimson within five runs.
But those were the last runs that the Crimson would score on the game.
“We just took a step back today,” Kregel said after the game. “The two games we played in Houston gave us momentum, but today we just couldn’t get it done.”
Junior pitcher Baron Davis started the game for Harvard. Davis, who earned the win in the Crimson’s 7-6 victory over Holy Cross last season, could not repeat the performance Wednesday and was tagged with a loss after three innings pitched.
“I personally didn’t perform well,” Davis said. “It was a tough game for our first home appearance.”
In addition to Davis, the Crimson sent six other pitchers to the mound.
The Crusaders struck the initial blow following a scoreless first inning. After a walk, a single, and a sacrifice bunt that put runners on second and third, Holy Cross freshman Nick Lovullo doubled deep into left field, driving in both runners and earning his team a 2-0 lead before Davis could finish off the side.
The Crimson responded quickly in the bottom of the inning. After two singles and a double play put Kregel on third, sophomore infielder Tanner Anderson laced a double into deep left-center, allowing Kregel to score.
In the top of the third, Holy Cross extended its lead on a sacrifice fly. In the bottom of the frame, Holy Cross took out senior pitcher George Perrotta in favor of sophomore Jeremy Perron.
After hitting Bailey on his first pitch, Perrotta retired the side to end the third.
After a Holy Cross walk and single with no outs that extended the Crusaders’ lead to 4-1, Decker brought in junior pitcher Sam Dodge to relieve Davis. Dodge would give up three more runs before finishing off the fourth inning with his team trailing, 7-1.
“We didn’t have that much energy today,” Kregel said. “We just expected to make plays, expected to win, but we need to do more.”
After Harvard failed to put any runs on the board in the bottom of the inning, Dodge was replaced with sophomore pitcher Matt Timoney. Although he threw a wild pitch and hit a batter, Timoney only gave up one run in the fifth.
Following another scoreless inning for the Crimson, Timoney was relieved by junior pitcher Peter Kaplan, who retired three straight before being subbed for senior right-hander Jordan Haviland in the seventh. Haviland gave up one run after an error from the Harvard infield before finishing off the Crusader side.
It was then that the Crimson made its push to get back in the game, but the team ended up stranding Kregel on third to end the three-run seventh inning.
Freshmen pitchers Matt Sanders and Shaun Rubin threw in the eighth and ninth innings, respectively, and neither allowed a run. But the damage was already done.
Harvard enters conference play with back-to-back double headers at Columbia and Penn this Saturday and Sunday.
“We have to play like we played [against Houston Baptist],” Decker said. “We have to attack the baseball and work hard to win going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the graduation of Keith Wright ’12 and the withdrawal of Kyle Casey, the Harvard men’s basketball team found itself with a lexically-ironic problem at the start of the 2011-2012 season—it was short on bigs.
The Crimson only had a few true big men returning from its previous campaign, and most of them had played just sporadic minutes in what was their rookie year. As a result, the Harvard offense shifted this past season, a change that reflected an overall trend in both the collegiate and professional games of basketball.
For a majority of the 2012-2013 season, the Crimson played a four-out offense. A typical lineup would feature freshman point guard Siyani Chambers bringing up the ball, with co-captains Christian Webster and Laurant Rivard as well as sophomore Wesley Chambers floating between the wings and the corners, and one of a rotation of sophomore big men down low. A series of screens would reflect which way the ball moved along the three-point line, and thus the rock would largely stay about 18 to 20-feet out from the basket until a back-screen or two opened up a shot, drive, or dish inside.
With its lack of size and the inherently slow-paced nature of Ivy League basketball, many of the Crimson’s possessions resulted in attempts from deep with the shot clock running low. And, with a starting five that featured four three-point threats at almost all times of the game, Harvard’s offense became increasingly reliant on dependable shooting from its undersized lineup.
The Crimson finished the regular season with a .401 shooting percentage from downtown—good for sixth in the nation, a 108-spot improvement from where it landed after the 2011-2012 campaign. Three of its players—Chambers, Rivard, and Saunders—shot over 40 percent from beyond the arc, while Webster came in at a 37-percent clip. As a result, not only did Harvard jump almost five percentage points in three point shooting, but its lack of a big man anchoring the team in the paint was largely hidden. The opposing teams’ need to stay out on shooters aided what the Crimson did have going down low, allowing its sophomore big men opportunities to go one-on-one rather than facing a collapsing defense. The squad’s outside-in mindset was especially apparent in Harvard’s match-up with New Mexico last week—Rivard and Webster combined to go 8-for-14 from downtown, thus diminishing the impact of the Lobos’ main defensive advantage, seven-footer Alex Kirk.
This transition in the Harvard offense from a traditional one guard, two wing, two post set to a four-out manner of play is reflective of trend beyond what happened within the walls of Lavietes Pavilion. It is a shift happening in other college gyms and, most noticeably, in NBA arenas around the country. NBA big men such as Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Love, and even Pau Gasol aat times, make their livings playing outside the paint, with the former two routinely stretching defenses behind the three-point line. Just last season, the Miami Heat won the NBA title without a dominant center, instead relying on small-ball and hot shooting from deep. The year before, the Dallas Mavericks did the same, hitting from downtown at a 41-percent clip behind the stroke of seven-footer Nowitzki.
What was a game dominated by the Shaquille O’Neals and David Robinsons of the world only a decade ago has now become one where the word “center” is an ambiguous, vague label for the taller guys in the league.
Perhaps the most tangible evidence of this transition came on Oct. 23 when the NBA decided to nix the center position from the all-star ballot. Accordingly, the distinction between forwards and centers was further blurred, and the general term “bigs” was left to encompass a range of players with a variety of skills. Stu Jackson, the Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations for the NBA, called the specification of the center position “outdated” and stated that it “didn’t represent the way our game has evolved.”
This evolution of the game, or de-evolution of the center position, is a controversial one for most traditional basketball fans, but it was more than welcomed by a Harvard team that came into its 2012-2013 season without a consistent big to whom it could turn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A shot at immediate redemption arrives on Saturday night for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team.  After a disappointing 16-7 loss to Albany on Tuesday night—the program’s worst defeat since 2011—the Crimson will face off against No. 10/12 Duke at 7 p.m. at Soldiers Field Stadium.
It has been a season of mixed results for Harvard (4-4, 1-1 Ivy) through the bulk of its early-season schedule. Strong wins over Georgetown and at Dartmouth have been tempered by near-misses against Massachusetts and Brown, a loss to No. 15/16 Hofstra, and Tuesday’s struggle against the Great Danes.
The Crimson sits at somewhat of a crossroads as the weekend nears, with both its regular season and Ivy League records even at .500. The potential momentum that would accompany a signature win over a perennial power like Duke looms large, especially with the majority of Harvard’s league schedule commencing next week.
But taking down the Blue Devils (7-4, 1-1 ACC) will be no small task. Duke has proven its mettle through a challenging schedule, emerging with impressive victories, including a tight 9-8 win over No. 5 Loyola and an 11-8 win over rival No. 6/7 North Carolina, one of its two road wins. Duke enters this Saturday’s matchup coming off of a 19-7 demolition of Georgetown last weekend; the Crimson escaped with a two-goal win over the Hoyas earlier this month.
The Harvard defense struggled on Tuesday to contain an Albany offense currently ranked first in the nation, and the Blue Devils, with a slightly less prolific seventh-ranked attack, will present similar challenges.
“In order to beat a team like Duke, we have to be sharp from start to finish,” senior goalkeeper Harry Krieger said. “We made a lot of mistakes in transition and penalty situations on Tuesday, and we are going to have to clean those up this weekend.”
Duke’s efforts are spearheaded by junior attackman Jordan Wolf, who tallies better than four points per contest and ranks as the nation’s 15th-best scorer. The Crimson will look to do a better job containing him than what they managed with Albany star Lyle Thompson, who notched four goals to go with four assists on Tuesday.
Stopping Duke will not be easy, but it is certainly not impossible for a Harvard defense that has been stifling at times this season. Its 8.29 goals allowed per game is good for 12th in the country.  Krieger had been dominant between the pipes before Tuesday’s defensive debacle—prior to that game, his .586 save percentage led the Ivy League, and he has already nabbed Ivy League and NEILA Player of the Week honors.  Besides Albany, only Holy Cross managed to tally double digits against Harvard.
Perhaps the Crimson’s offensive concerns merit comparatively more attention. Harvard has struggled to rack up goals this season in the manner it has in years past.
“We need to be executing better on offense [against Duke],” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said.
Freshman attackman Devin Dwyer has emerged as a go-to option, and senior Alex White and junior Peter Shwartz have carried much of the remaining load on offense. But the shoes of Jeff Cohen ’12, last season’s leading scorer, have yet to be filled, and perhaps the most likely preseason candidate to pick up the slack, junior attackman Daniel Eipp, has yet to consistently replicate the offensive dominance of his first two seasons.
The Blue Devils’ top-30 defense will be among the best Harvard has faced, and a Crimson victory will be all the more difficult if its offense can’t muster better than the six goals it has averaged through its past three games.
Harvard might stand to benefit from the typically brisk New England spring temperatures forecasted for Saturday night; the Blue Devils have only played one game outside of North Carolina so far this season. But even with the conditions on its side, the Crimson will need a defensive effort consistent with its performances before last Tuesday and a sustained offensive attack that prolongs through an entire game what have largely been just flashes of greatness.
“[Duke is] a very well-rounded team,” Krieger said. “We can’t let them dictate the game…. We need to play our game and everything else should fall into place.”
Saturday’s contest will be nationally televised on NBC Sports Network.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their final competitive event of the season, eight members of the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team will hit the water in Indianapolis to compete in the 2013 NCAA Division I Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships. Coming off a season in which the Crimson went undefeated in dual meets before barely losing the Ivy League Championships to four-time defending champion Princeton, Harvard will have one final test against the nation’s best squads.
The Crimson will send swimmers to compete in five individual events as well as all five relays over the course of the weekend. Sophomore Michael Mosca will be the lone representative of the diving contingent, having qualified for the national championships in both the one-meter and three-meter events.
“I’m excited to find out [what I can do at NCAA’s],” Mosca said. “I would love to beat my best so I can get points for my team. I think it’s great to be able to compete on the national level for Harvard men’s swimming and diving. There’s going to be a bunch of swimmers from our team, so it will be a great experience to dive alongside those swimmers.”
Harvard looks to improve upon its 34th place finish at last year’s national championship. California took home the national title in 2012, beating out the University of Texas by a 44.5-point margin. Stanford rounded out the top three team finishers.
Last year’s national championship was full of fresh faces, as all five of Harvard’s competitors were either freshmen or sophomores. This year, the seasoned veterans return to the national championships as All-Americans, looking to spearhead the Crimson’s 2013 campaign.
In 2012, sophomores Griffin Schumacher and Chuck Katis and juniors Oliver Lee and Chris Satterthwaite teamed for a 16th-place showing in last year’s 400 relay, earning honorable mention All-American accolades. Satterthwaite, Katis, Schumacher, and Zach Walters also earned All-American honors after finishing in 13th place in last year’s 800 free relay.
This year, all five return as members of Harvard’s various relay teams. Schumacher, Lee, and Satterthwaite will be joined by junior Danny Crigler in the 200 free relay. The team is coming off a victory at the Ivy League Championships, where it set a school record and posted an NCAA ‘A’ standard time in the event. Satterthwaite, Schumacher, and Lee will then be joined by Walters in the 400 free relay. The four combined for the ninth-fastest time in the nation this season and posted a school record on the way to a victory at the Ivy League Championships.
Walters, Schumacher, Katis, and Satterthwaite will then compete in the 800 free relay. The team is coming off a third-place finish at Ivies two weeks ago.
The Crimson will also take part in the 200 and 400 medley relays. The 200 medley squad—consisting of Satterthwaite, Katis, Lee, and Crigler—took second at Ivies but set a program record just a few weeks earlier at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton dual meet, where the Crimson became the first Ivy League school to beat Princeton in its home pool.
In the 400 medley, Satterthwaite, Katis, and Lee will be joined by Schumacher, as the group looks to replicate its success at Ivies, where it set a new program record en route to a first-place finish.
It will be a busy schedule from start to finish for the Harvard swimmers. All are competing in multiple relay events. Three swimmers will also be competing for the Crimson in individual events.
Katis will make an appearance in both the 100 and 200 breast events. Katis qualified for NCAA’s after setting NCAA ‘A’ standard times at the University of Georgia Fall Invite. He looks to improve on his 10th-place finish in the 100 and 20th-place finish in the 200 from last season’s national championship.
Meanwhile, Oliver Lee will make a return appearance in the 50 free after having set a school record in the preliminary swim at the Ivy League Championships. Satterthwaite is set to compete in the 100 as well as the 200 free. He is the reigning Ivy League champion in both events.
For the Crimson, a strong performance in this weekend’s national championships is just another step in establishing Harvard as a top-tier swimming program.
“[Making NCAA’s] is a really important step for our team,” Katis said. “We have an incredibly fast recruiting class coming in next year. We have work to do, but these are just stepping stones on the way to becoming a top 20, top 10 school.”

Harvard's third ever NCAA Tournament qualification was enough of an accomplishment. But a win from 14th-seeded Harvard against 3rd-seeded New Mexico? Let's just say the average Harvardian wouldn't have predicted it.
We spoke to some undergraduates who were lucky enough to find themselves on the sidelines at last week's games to hear what they were like.
"I was really pessimistic the whole time," says Kendall L. Sherman '15, who went to the game with family from the Salt Lake City region. "I just did not think we were gonna pull it off, and two minutes before the end of the game it finally hit me that we were actually going to win."
 
Ally M. Freedy '14, manager of the Harvard band, remembers seeing the majority of the stadium go quiet as the Crimson section went wild. "They were just stunned I think, and shocked to be upset by a school that they thought wasn't a sports college," she said.
 
The fans at the game weren't alone. No one expected the 68-62 outcome—only 5.6 percent of ESPN's 8.15 million submitted tournament brackets picked the Harvard win. "We kinda shocked the world," said Freedy.
Following the win over spring break, many students' celebrations took place online as Facebook newsfeeds overflowed with Crimson pride.
 
"It was really exciting. When I came to Harvard, I wasn't even aware that sports was a big culture here," Harvard band member Bianca A. Trombetta '15 said. "Now the students really should see that basketball should be supported by the college as a whole."
 
There's no question we have something to cheer about now.
 
"First of all, we won the game. Second of all, it was our first time winning [in March Madness]. And it was a huge upset," said Sherman. "It was awesome."

"Some people left their economics notes on the plane. Can Martin Feldstein, Lawrence Summers, and Jeff Liebman please come to gate C10 to retrieve your economics notes?"
On Tuesday night, that announcement came over the loudspeakers at Dulles Airport in Washington, DC. The Harvard World Model UN team, on their way back from Sydney, Australia, heard it over the intercom while changing planes at Dulles.
"The entire team thought it was quite hilarious," said Damon Y. Meng '13. After hearing the announcement, Meng posted it on Facebook, where it received 159 "likes."
Alas, upon further investigation, the famed economics professors were not the ones to leave their notes on the plane. It turns out that the notes belonged to Joshua C. Zhang '14, a junior with the World MUN group enrolled in Harvard's Economics 1420: American Economic Policy, a class taught by all three professors.
So much for the future of economics being left on an airplane.
