After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Xavier Dolan may have just turned 30, but he already has eight feature films under his belt. His newest film channels some of the themes he knows best — boyish angst, toxic mothers, and ambiguous sexuality — in a story located in his hometown of Quebec about two lifelong friends grappling with more-than-platonic feelings for each other. “Matthias et Maxime” is a contemplative exploration of male friendship and intimacy that sees Dolan more restrained and pulled back from his usual flurry of screaming matches and fourth-wall interruptions. In result, however, it lacks the sense of urgency, the emotional risk-taking that brings one close to the characters and to the director himself, such that their romance never convincingly comes to life.
After Matthias (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) loses a bet with friends, Rivette (Pier-Luc Funk) convinces him to act in his younger sister Erika’s (a hilarious Camille Felton) film with Maxime (played by Dolan himself). Always injecting her speech with English slang, Erika describes her project for school as “super impressionist but also expressionist” and reveals that her two leads make out. Max recalls a time in high school when he and Matt might’ve kissed, which Matt doesn’t seem to remember — but given that he also claimed to have never corrected Rivette’s grammar, which there was video evidence for, Matt seems to have a selective memory. But he has no choice but to ruminate their kiss now, and becomes quietly brooding. He avoids interacting with Max, even up until he’s about to leave for two years to Australia, and is noticeably distracted at his banker-type job and with his wife, Sarah (Marilyn Castonguay). More than once, he looks longingly at Max through a window. But his attempts to suppress his emotions often come at the expense of those who care about him — “The kiss meant nothing to me, Sarah!” he yells — which makes him a difficult character to care for, though Dolan evidently wants both characters in this latent romance to evoke empathy.
While Matt has these moments of supposed reflection, Max does not, perhaps because he doesn’t have the privilege or time to think about his brewing feelings. He cares for his mother, Manon (Anne Dorval), a physically abusive, recovering drug addict who doesn’t want his help, though she’s pretty much helpless without him. After the two get into another explosive fight, Max takes the bus home and makes suggestive eye contact with a man, but his interested smile turns into a look of concern as Max’s forehead starts to bleed from the TV remote that his mother threw at him — their shared gaze is interrupted by the pain caused by his mother. (He also has a dark pink, teardrop-shaped scar on his cheek that makes him look like he’s crying blood.) Still, it sometimes feels as though the kiss didn’t affect Max at all — he asks out his coworker, Lisa (Catherine Brunet), and spends his remaining days at home with his friends before departing.
Dolan is a controlled and deeply affecting actor, and D’Almeida Freitas is expressive despite his few words. But there’s something missing between the two, and their emotional turmoil never bubbles to the surface. Each — with varying degrees of transparency — is struggling to grasp their feelings for one another, but the exploration of their romance stops there and fails to resonate with meaning or passion. Dolan relies on musical cues to conjure the inner turmoil of his characters — such as a forceful piano riff when Matt goes for a swim the morning after the kiss — but the score isn’t enough to bond the two, and his witty screenplay only enlivens the friends' hang outs rather than the bond between Matt and Max. Their romance, which is intended to drive the story, inevitably feels like the subplot of two friends who must soon bid farewell.
“I want to understand,” Max pleads to Matt in one of the final scenes. It’s one of the film’s most poignant moments — and one of the only scenes that feature the two alone — but it comes much too late. We, too, want to understand, but neither Matt nor Dolan responds to Max’s cry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cannes Film Festival attracts a number of eccentric types of journalists. Here, Crimson Cannes correspondents break them down.
Editor’s Note: The Crimson granted anonymity to the following sources because they all fear retaliation from each other.
SMOKY: Middle-aged man who asks you to save his spot in line so that he can take a smoke break; otherwise, he hot-boxes the entire line in a giant cloud of cigarette smoke.
LES WRINKLÉS: Elderly woman who takes advantage of her age to cut in front of everyone. Do I know you people? GET AWAY FROM ME!
EVERYONE’S “BUDDY:” Cuts in line with: “Hey, man, what’s up? Don’t you remember me? From that one event at that one place that one time?”
Bonus points for a double cheek kiss (we’re in Europe, not Burger King, you uncivilized piece of trash)
JACQUES: French man who sits on the ground and pretends to not understand anyone who confronts him about cutting in line. Quoi le fuck? C’est quoi, un “line”? Je vais plant my ass ici.
S’IL VOUS PLAIT: Young adult in formalwear holding up a sign soliciting an invite to a premiere that not even journalists will get into all the while holding a threatening sign that says something like, “Give me an invite or I will spoil Game of Thrones.”
BONUS if they go for the passive-aggressive guilt-trip and hit you with the “I’M A FILM STUDENT :-(”
PINK BADGE: Shows up 10 minutes before the premiere because fuck you.
WHITE BADGE: Shows up 10 seconds before the premiere because double fuck you.
AMANDA: Exasperated American twentysomething who’s, like, so over this; live-tweets every time someone breathes in her direction
DINNER? Will sneakily try to hit on you via handwritten note in the press room, proposing not one, but two date options: dinner, or perhaps, “a wine?”
OLD FANBOY: He may look like your friend’s dad, but his hands WILL shake when he asks Brad Pitt for an autograph
DRINK MOOCHER: Asks for so many free cans of San Pellegrino from the press lounge that the employees stop giving him any.
“No more orange juice, sir. Only coffee.”
TIRED BUT WIRED: Like drink moocher’s insane cousin; has been shotgunning Nespresso since day 1, and we’re not talking “lungo deca / Intensité 2”; has the hot, rancid breath of a literal swamp monster; plants die in his wake
PHOTOG: Slowly scanning photo of Elton John from head to toe, with more forensic deliberation than Tarantino examining the average foot
WANNABE PHOTOGRAPHER: Sits in the last row on the balcony of the Grand Théâtre Lumière, yet still whips out their phone to try to catch a blurry ass photo of the director entering the theater
*squinting at intense zoom* “See, Marion Cotillard is… that one, in blue”
I’M TRYING: A few days into the festival, gets so overwhelmed that he reviews three movies in one article #subtweet
ODD FLEXER: Comes to Cannes but doesn’t write a single review; instead live-tweets every party they attend and every celebrity encounter
BIKER GANG: One excessively perky employee in a press-emblazoned T-shirt, handing out free copies of the daily while seated on the handlebars, pedaled around laboriously by an overworked, sweaty counterpart who periodically mutters a morose “Free Daily (subtext I hate my G.D. job)”
GROSS COUGHER: Sputters and coughs violently next to you during the film because he has some anachronistic diagnosis of a disease eradicated in the 1930s; definitely spreading those pathogens faster than free dailies #GetVaccinated
SEAT SAVER: “Yeah, no, sorry, my entire row of co-writers went to the bathroom”
EXCUSEZ-MOI: I have to pee. 67 times. Also get a snack and call my divorce lawyer. Please tuck your legs in or stand up or so help me God I will piss on you
MUNCHIES: Repeatedly forgets that food or drink isn’t allowed in Grand Théâtre Lumière; has to inhale their dinner salads before going through the security check
“Eat VERY quickly over there”
WHERE THE FUCK AM I? Will ask you if this is the press line, then ask the person behind you to make sure — then leaves?
BEEP BEEP: Has 10 watches, some loose change, and a straight-up detached circuit board in his pocket when he goes through the metal detector; security guards frisk him daily like what the fuck not again Georges
I’M ANNOYED: Stop shaking your leg. Crouch down so I can see, tall freak. And for the love of God, if you so much as sneeze or fart at an inopportune time, je téléphone à la police.
PROM QUEEN: Insists on wearing a glittery gown and heels to EVERY press screening *just in case* Leo shows up
Followed by enthusiastic cameraman for no discernible reason
THE TECH GUY: Has like, 10 different wires attached to his computer for some reason?
Can see craters on the moon with that lens, or at least Margot Robbie’s nose pores on a cellular level; definitely compensating for something
DWEEB: When asked to take a picture of someone, puts the camera on selfie mode, then flips the phone so that the screen faces away from him and struggles for a good five minutes to press the right button to take the photo
KEITH: Wearing a neon orange KANYE 2012 shirt; really proactive about line-cutters because “every person counts” which is pretty admirable, but keeps threatening to punch someone, which is decidedly less chivalric
WANNABE-DIRECTOR/ARTISTÉ: Maybe made films that never got produced. Maybe wrote screenplays that no one picked up. Maybe got cut from every audition. Regardless, the wannabe is here writing about the works that he wishes he was making instead. Has that flunking-out-of-art-school look, which is fine and all, except for the fact that he clearly can’t remember the last time he showered, because that shaggy “artsy” hair smells so bad it makes everyone in the vicinity want to vomit.
CHAD: “Ay yo Gaspar, sick movie dude! You do this a lot?” (Inevitably and always American)
IMMA LET YOU FINISH: waits 45 minutes in line to get a seat, then gets up to leave as soon as the Festival credits roll up
CAROLINE: Has “anxiety about crowds” but still gets there two hours in advance to see the faint top of Leonardo DiCaprio’s head, hasn’t eaten in a full year but “I’m not really that hungry”
KAYLEE: Wait stop is that a dog? Can we get candy after this? I’ll only wake up early if Robert Pattinson is there
LUCY: Fan in her laptop constantly on verge of busting, sleeps at 5 a.m. every night and “plans on attending an 8:30 a.m. premiere,” but still gets 7 hours of sleep, ya know what I mean?
DOGGO: Only unproblematic attendee; just here to be a good boy. Probably wearing a tiny beret or scarf. Woof.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Author Margaret Atwood and composer Poul Ruders introduced the opera production of “The Handmaid’s Tale” to Boston with a conversation on May 4 at WBUR’s CitySpace. The opera was first staged in 2000 in Copenhagen, but its May 5 to 11 run staged by the Boston Lyric Opera at Harvard’s Lavietes Pavilion marked its Boston premiere. Atwood offered context behind the central themes of the production, particularly those of political control and female subjugation. Ruders explained why these messages translated well to music, and performers presented a sample of the work.
The premise for “The Handmaid’s Tale” is rooted in a dystopian near-future, where the United States has collapsed to a totalitarian Christian theocracy called Gilead. Key themes include the subjugation of women and the structure of totalitarian societies. The conversation explored the real life inspiration behind these themes, and, with audio clips of segments of the production and live performances, explained how the adaptation of the acclaimed novel into an opera can shed a unique perspective on the much-adapted source material (“The Handmaid’s Tale” is the subject of a motion picture and a television series currently airing on Hulu).
When asked why the themes in “The Handmaid’s Tale” resonate with a modern audience, Atwood commented on the efficacy of building a world that was believable.
"There’s nothing within the book that hasn’t already happened somewhere in real life or for which we don’t have the technology,” she said.
Atwood penned the novel (first published in 1985) while living in West Berlin at the height of the Cold War, where the stark contrast between life on either side of the Iron Curtain served as some inspiration for the creation of the totalitarian state of Gilead. After the first film (of the same name) was screened in East Germany, Atwood commented on the country's response as a testament to the brutal reality of living in a totalitarianism system. “They watched very intently and afterwards they said, ‘This was our life.’ You had the feeling that you could not, that you did not know who to trust.”
Ruders commented on how his score serves to realize Atwood’s thematic vision into sound.
“What music can do is to add the extra dimension,” he said. One example of this was the use of music to distinguish between the main narrative, set in Gilead, and flashbacks, set in the contemporary U.S. “In the time before, music is easygoing. I use a watermark — three chords — which distinguish a shift in time.”
Atwood elaborated on Ruders’s comments, suggesting that opera was also a unique medium in effectively depicting thought from her characters.
“How do you present speech for people who aren’t allowed to speak? In the first film, the director initially put voice over but he took it out, which I thought was a mistake. Conventions in opera allow for people on stage to sing and talk without others on stage knowing,” Atwood said.
Paul Bentley, the opera’s librettist, was also in attendance at the conversation. He gave insight into the style of music in the opera and the power of live music, contrasting it from the effects of music in the Hulu TV show.
“I watched the first episode on television, and very quickly, I was missing the music that wasn't nearly as powerful on television as you get in the opera house because the stupendous orchestration and orchestra wasn't there.,” Bentley said. “I would put as many types of music as I possibly can within the opera. Poul's music does this time and time again.”
As the conversation drew to a close, pianist Nathan Salazar and mezzo-soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano, who plays protagonist Offred in the production, performed an aria, which Atwood jokingly referred to as the “only aria in opera to be sung about the menstrual cycle.” Atwood commented on how the sample performance encapsulated some of the key themes in her work. “It's a lamenting feeling of being divorced from her body; her body has become a source of distress for her,” Atwood said.
Atwood’s parting words embodied hope for the new generation of opera-goers.
“Young people don’t usually go to the opera, who may never have gone to the opera before,” Atwood said. “What I’m happy about right now is the generations of, let’s say, under 25, particularly the ones who have become articulate about gun control and the extinction resistance which is now sweeping through high schools and colleges. It’s going to be harder to do totalitarianism here, partly because it’s so diverse. You can’t just get hold of one demographic of the people and convince them all to do your will. Multiplicity is actually strength under these conditions.”

After a full four years, seniors have seen it all. Growing up is what college is all about, but maybe as a freshman it would’ve been helpful to know which Harvard Square restaurants are a complete rip-off and when is the best time to do laundry. We emailed a handful of graduating seniors asking them what advice they would give to their freshmen selves.
Some seniors wanted to encourage their younger selves to be open to new experiences:
“If I could go back in time, I would probably tell myself to try more things earlier, as well as to trust in myself and who I am!”
— Myles G. Marshall ’19
“I would tell my freshman self to invest in community because the people around you will be what makes your time at Harvard special. I would also say that that requires getting out of your room more (I watched a lot of Netflix that year haha) and putting yourself out there to find people who you connect with!”
— Julia E. Villasenor ’19
Other emphasized that they shouldn’t have stressed out as much and wanted to tell their freshmen selves that it would all work out eventually:
“After freshman year, it can be easy to feel like you need to be totally adjusted to college. But of course life will throw things you never imagined your way. In turn, you will change — and that's a good thing! Don't beat yourself up because you think you should have things figured out by now.”
— Melissa “Missy” Dreier ’19
“I would honestly tell my freshmen [sic] self to calm down and try to enjoy the moment as much as possible. I was (and still am) someone who did not take the “conventional” and "paved" road of life. The decision to take the “road less traveled” came with a lot of anxiety and doubts about whether I was going to be “successful.””
— Amma N. Ababio ’19
Some gave Harvard-specific advice:
“Take more walks/jogs along the river! It’s conducive for soul searching, hanging out, admiring the beauty of nature, etc.”
— Rebekah H. Chun ’19
While others gave more general advice:
“My friends supported me in every challenge I took on, struggled through problem sets with me late into the night, helped me to rise up through personal struggles, and celebrated with me after each success. I'm so grateful for these many wonderful people, and if I could do it all over again, I only wish that I'd met them sooner.”
— Sean Gibney ’19
“Learn the meaning of self-awareness.”
— Eric R. Wasserman ’19
As much as we may wish we could go back and inform our younger selves, some things just take a full college experience to figure out. Congratulations to the graduating seniors on everything that you have learned and accomplished since freshman year!
