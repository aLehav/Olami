After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The “John Wick” franchise has reinvigorated the action movie genre in a time when the action in movies is often incomprehensible, clouded by quick cuts, shaky-camera movements, and cheap special effects. Thankfully, “John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum” — the latest entry in this unapologetically bloody, but increasingly successful action franchise — lives up to its predecessors: It delivers stunningly choreographed, beautifully shot sequences with Keanu Reeves giving a dedicated performance as the titular lead.
The story picks up immediately where “John Wick: Chapter 2” left off: John Wick is mere minutes away from being excommunicated by the "High Table" (the high command for assassins) because he killed one of its members. When the "High Table" places a $14 million bounty on Wick’s head, assassins swarm to hunt him down, setting off one thrilling action set piece after another. The film's relatively simple premise of an assassin on the run succeeds because it constantly generates momentum; John Wick never catches a break, so neither does the audience.
Director Chad Stahelski (who has helmed all three “John Wick” films) is a stunt veteran, notably completing Brandon Lee’s performance in “The Crow” following Lee's untimely death in shooting, and incidentally performing some of Keanu Reeves’ stunts as a double in “The Matrix." His experience in the craft of stunt-work and love of its role in the action genre is infectious in “John Wick: Chapter 3,” where he makes the most of the film’s exceptional stunt-work with takes that are long enough for the audience to discern who’s fighting who, and that are peppered with wide shots that allow the audience to admire the realism of characters’ movements. It’s especially refreshing to see an action movie with this degree of bloodshed pay so much attention to cinematography. Each frame is intricately blocked, beautifully lit, and vividly colored to engross viewers in the alien world of assassins.
“John Wick: Chapter 3” achieves such a high caliber of stunt-work because of Keanu Reeves’ commitment to his performance. For a man with his skill in stunt work and ability to deliver gruff one-liners, Reeves finds himself completely in his element, and “Parabellum” capitalizes on his unique talent, as Reeves performing 90% of his own stunts. When a lead actor does their own stunts, the director doesn't have to cut every time the actor has to be replaced by a stunt double. It also means that the director doesn’t have to intentionally shake the camera to hide the fact that a stunt double is being used. Avoiding the jerky, nauseating fast-cut fight scenes allows for watchable results, and “Parabellum” goes above and beyond with truly creative kill-sequences (including the snapping of a neck with a book), some uncompromising close-up shots that make the audience squirm, and even deaths that Stahelski plays for physical comedy.
Action films earn credibility based on how their actors handle stunts: The most successful films in the genre feature leads who give their all to their physical performances. For instance, “Mission: Impossible” has stayed popular for more than 20 years largely because of Tom Cruise’s physical commitment to his role: The fourth entry in the series, “Ghost Protocol," features a death-defying action scene where Cruise scales the Burj Khalifa. Reeves performs with similar grit in “Parabellum," especially in an adrenaline-charged sword fight that doubles as a motorcycle chase. This sequence would have been impossible to shoot with an actor lacking Reeves' vigor and professionalism — with it, the film is an unrelenting action spectacle.
The main issues of the film begin to surface when Stahelski tries to achieve too much. There are moments when the plot becomes unnecessarily bloated: A significant portion of the narrative involves John Wick searching for people to help revoke his excommunication. Inevitably, a number of scenes devolve into people explaining the plot. These exposition-burdened sequences introduce the audience to new characters, the most prominent being Sofia (Halle Berry), who agrees to help John Wick because of a shared past. Such new characters seem like pawns in Stahelski's efforts at world-building rather than valuable additions to the story. “John Wick: Chapter 2” introduced the audience to a world where assassins follow a code of conduct, use their own currency, and stay in “consecrated” hotels. Stahelski puts a lot of effort into furthering this world, traveling to outposts abroad and deepening the mythology of the series with more information on how the "High Table" operates and how assassins function. While this world feels compelling, some of these set-up scenes feel forced against the high-octane action sequences.
Another shortcoming is that, like its predecessors, “Parabellum” features forgettable antagonists. The Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon), an enforcer for the High Table, and their main assassin recruit Zero (Mark Dacascos) never feel like insurmountable threats. Their dispensability is largely due to their flat, meager dialogue: The Adjudicator’s lines feel redundant and generic, and many of Zero’s lines are played for comic relief (with uneven results), which deeply undercut tension in the fight scenes between him and John Wick. Stahelski wants to achieve something more with these characters: He uses them to set up the theme of rules and order versus going rogue, but like their characterization, these themes are never fully explored. Still, "Parabellum" isn't meant to be a thought piece on power and control, even though it broaches such themes, so the lack of depth is somewhat forgivable.
Any of these issues would have been enough to sink a lesser movie to the realm of generic action blockbuster, but while its deficiencies in storytelling and character are noticeable, they don't distract from the overall experience. “Parabellum” is a movie that largely knows what it wants to be and succeeds in doing so, filling the screen with heart-stopping choreography and vibrant cinematography. It pushes the “John Wick” franchise to the forefront of the imagination as a cornerstone that disrupts the oft-generic, unwatchable Hollywood action genre.

The Harvard Allston Land Company is soliciting proposals from developers for the initial construction phase of its Enterprise Research Campus in Allston in a formal request issued Friday, according to Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
The land company, which was established in November 2018, oversees Harvard’s the planned 36-acre Enterprise Research Campus next to the University's developing Allston campus. The complex is a University project intended to facilitate collaborations between Harvard-affiliated research projects and “research-focused” companies.
The land company sent out its request for proposals more than a year after Boston’s Planning and Development Agency approved inital plans for a 14.1-acre portion of the site in March 2018. That area will include 400,000 square feet of land for office space, 250,000 square feet for residential space, and room for approximately 800 parking spaces.
While the request for proposals is not a public document, it is available upon request to any qualified developers, according to O’Rourke.
The land company plans to identify a single developer later this year for the initial stage of construction, according to O’Rourke. The company will then enter negotiations with the city of Boston for specific projects within the 14.1-acre space.
Thomas P. Glynn III — the land company's chief executive officer and former head of Massachusetts Port Authority — wrote in an emailed statement that the request is a critical step in developing Harvard’s properties in Allston.
“The RFP is an important next step in realizing the transformational vision of an exciting new urban district focused on research, entrepreneurship, and innovation in Allston,” Glynn wrote.
Glynn added that the Enterprise Research Campus will house companies that will be able to offer “cutting-edge" internships to students.
“It will contribute to a thriving community and neighborhood that brings together academia and education, engaging public and community spaces,” Glynn said.
When Harvard filed its initial framework for the design of the Enterprise Research Campus in December 2017, some Allston residents raised concerns about housing, infrastructure, transportation, and open space during a BPDA-mandated comment period.
In response, the University filed a letter in March 2018 that said the planned residential space would include “upwards of 1,000” units of housing for local residents. The letter also noted that 13 percent of the enterprise research construction projects would be classified as affordable, in accordance with the city’s housing inclusivity policy.
Harvard’s long-term vision for the 36-acre campus beyond the 14.1 acre space also centers around transportation — the University intends to expand existing public transit options and create an environment more accessible to bikers and pedestrians, according to December 2017 filings. In January 2018, Harvard pledged $50 million to fund the construction of a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority commuter rail stop called ‘West Station’ and promised up to $8 million to help construct another interim transportation station in Allston.
While Harvard has owned some land in Allston for decades, its presence has grown in recent years as the University significantly expands into the neighborhood. Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences plans to open a new campus — which will be located next to the Enterprise Research Campus — in Allston in September 2020.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard economics professor and former presidential advisor Martin S. “Marty” Feldstein ’61 died Tuesday at age 79.
Feldstein was a prolific academic who served in a number of political roles. During his career, he served as the chief economic advisor to Ronald Reagan and the president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He also penned scores of op-eds and papers, some of which predicted changes to come in both national and international economies.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Jason Furman ’92 — a former student of Feldstein’s — said that his mentor predicted how the Euro would sow strife within Europe and was also quick to spot the 2008 national recession.
A New York native, Feldstein attended the College and went on to Oxford for a graduate degree. He returned to teach at Harvard in 1967.
Jeffrey B. Liebman, a professor of public policy at the Kennedy School, said that Feldstein — his dissertation advisor — was “legendary” as a teacher.
“He gave us unlimited amounts of his time, whatever resources we need for our research,” Liebman said. “He never took a sabbatical because he never wanted to miss an opportunity to teach.”
Economics professor and incoming Lowell House faculty dean David I. Laibson ’88 said in a written statement that Feldstein was “a terrific mentor and a champion of young scholars.”
Many of Feldstein’s former students went on to reach the upper tiers of the economics profession. They include former University president Lawrence H. Summers, whom Feldstein hired as an undergraduate research assistant in 1973, and Economics professor Raj Chetty ’00.
“I sent Marty an email to work as his research assistant when I was a freshman at Harvard in 1997. He replied and basically set me on my career path today,” Chetty said in a written statement. “[He’s] someone who could go from talking with the President of the U.S. to a first-year at the college and educate them both while making them feel valued.”
Feldstein’s mentorship did not expire after graduation. He told his students that they were “students for life,” according to Liebman.
“I remember when I was working in the Clinton administration on social security reform, I looked around the room, and there were five economists working on the security plan. And four of us had been trained by Marty,” Liebman said.
The fifth person in the room was an intellectual “grandchild” of Feldstein’s, having been trained by one of his students.
Feldstein’s passion for policy was one that he transmitted to those he taught, according to economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who succeeded Feldstein as head of the course Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics.”
He wanted every student “to actually understand the world; to be able to read the newspaper as an intelligent citizen,” Mankiw said.
Feldstein himself advised Reagan and Obama alike, the latter as a member of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
Furman — who formerly served as chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers — said that Feldstein gave generous advice to politicians on both sides of the aisle.
“Marty was one of the people who set the tone for inclusiveness and openness to dialogue,” Mankiw said.
Feldstein also championed practical and policy-oriented research at the National Bureau of Economic Research during his three-decade tenure as president of the non-profit.
“Among Marty’s gifts to the economics profession was the creation of the ‘new’ NBER, a remarkable innovation that has been emulated elsewhere,” Economics professor Claudia Goldin said in a written statement.
Mankiw added that Feldstein was a “bridge-builder” not just intellectually, but also socially, often hosting dinners for students and colleagues at his Belmont home.
“He was a builder of the economics profession both through his professional activities and his social activities,” Mankiw said.
