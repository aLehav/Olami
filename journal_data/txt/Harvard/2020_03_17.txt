After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Roddy Ricch’s hit song “The Box” entered its 12th week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, the rapper finally premiered his official music video on YouTube last Friday, Feb. 28. Through a hodgepodge of action scenes, the video reflects the classic and contemporary hip-hop themes of Ricch’s song. With over 22 million views on YouTube already, the new video could give “The Box” the surge it needs to contend with Lil Nas X’s 17 week No. 1 Billboard record “Old Town Road” for longest No. 1 streak.
The video opens with someone spray painting a street race starting line on the concrete as muscle cars rumble and “The Box” spans the screen in a slim graffiti font. Ricch pulls his car into the frame and the song’s legendary, squeaking intro commences. As a stereotypically seductive flag girl starts the race, the verse begins. In contrast to Ricch’s chill, measured flow, the video cuts quickly between shots to better match the intensity of Ricch’s lyrics.
Much of the video is a visual representation of the rapper’s best lines. Ricch sings, “I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter” while elbow deep in a basketball hoop. A luxury duffel is pulled out of a muddy hill as “I got it out the mud” beats in the background. Ricch says “I’m a 2020 president candidate” while standing in front of a faux White House press curtain.
The short action shots are accentuated by some gaudy CGI effects. At one point, the camera pans around Ricch as he stands horizontally on the wall of a burning building. While not exactly Oscar-worthy, the graphics deserve recognition for pushing the hip-hop genre into an even more fantastical representation of Ricch’s lavish lifestyle.
Ricch’s video also pays homage to classic hip-hop gangster tropes with specific references to gang violence and drug deals in popular culture rather than just generic call-outs to money, fame, and women. He honors Scarface’s last stand and gives further recognition to the past with the line “we been trappin’ like the 80s.” With these artistic nods, Ricch really “won’t never sell [his] soul” to viral stardom and proves that he can back up his boastful claims.
In the end, the action-packed video doesn’t quite break new ground for visual hip-hop artistry. But with its CGI flourishes and the sustained fame of the song, it's still worth a view. Stick around to the end and you’ll be rewarded with an eerie, deeper look into the metaphor of “The Box.”

On Feb. 28, Harry Styles released the video for “Falling,” the fourth single from his 2019 album “Fine Line.”
The video starts with a black screen that cuts to Styles, soaking wet and barefoot on the floor of a flooding room. The setting looks straight out of a museum, with the room’s marble decor and a single large Victorian-style window flooding the room with light. As the song’s piano melody continues, the video jumps to Styles playing the tune on an elaborately decorated piano, as the camera pans from his golden drink to the chunky golden rings stacked on his fingers.
Fans have long speculated that the song is about Styles’ ex-girlfriend Camille Rowe, and allusions to Rowe fill the video. The Eiffel Tower’s silhouette just visible behind the window reflects her French heritage, and the ruby ring he wears on his right pinky finger, according to fans, has been previously spotted on Rowe.
Styles stops playing only to cradle his drink, as he sings about having “no one to blame but the drink in [his] wandering hands.” As he plays, the water-filled piano begins to overflow with every note. The more he continues, the more the piano begins to spill water from its interior, yet Styles remains seemingly unaware. Not allowing the flooding room to move him from his post at the piano bench, Styles continues to play as though his life depends on it, and for a second it seems like it does. As he sings the song’s emotional chorus, his gaze never leaves the camera, giving Styles the appearance of aching for an answer to his pain — or perhaps recognition of it. “What if I’m someone I don’t want around?” he sings, as his eyes scan his audience.
The video is characterized by these intimate close-ups of Styles as well as by wide shots of the flooding room, as golden sunlight fills it from behind the piano and the ornate chandelier hanging above. From his spot at the instrument, Styles’ lilac chiffon Gucci dress is on full display, with the dress’s six-foot train trailing behind him.
As the song crescendos towards its peak, the water begins to fall more and more violently from the top and sides of the piano, his emptying drink unmoved from its spot next to the piano’s music stand. As Styles pours his feelings into the instrument, the instrument returns them in the form of a flood, bubbling up from its insides.
The dress’s six-foot train begins to float up as Styles continues singing, stopping only for one moment to look up and cry out that he’s “falling” before the water completely submerges him. The room, now completely flooded, is reminiscent of a Brett Stanley photograph, as the sunlight breaks through the water in rays that illuminate the room’s ornate décor. Through all this drama, Styles keeps playing, contemplating the water that has surrounded him as his hair and dress float away.
The piano bench floats and, eventually, so does he. “I’m falling again,” Styles sings as he rises up with the water, only to quickly sink back down — effectively trapping himself in his own emotions. The confident stares to the camera are replaced by an unmistakable sadness. The video ends with Styles seemingly dejected by the place where his emotions have left him stranded: underwater and with nowhere to go. He begins to cry, though his state is evident only by his quivering lips and chin, his tears made invisible under the still-rising water. As he finally begins to look up, the camera cuts away and we leave Styles as we started: with a black screen and a piano melody.

On Mar. 6 and 7, in Farkas Hall Room 303, Hyperion Shakespeare Company put on their semesterly scene recital. “Exit; Pursued by a Bear” is a series of Shakespeare scenes themed around animals, co-produced by Lindsay T. McAuliffe ’20 and Anna M. Schuliger ’20 and featuring snippets from “Two Gentlemen of Verona,” “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Richard III,” and “Twelfth Night.”
On a whiteboard next to where the audience sat, a stick-figure bear stood on its hind legs and the word “Shakespeare” was drawn next to it in black, then red Expo marker. The Expo marker text drooped as it was written. The outlining was sometimes distant from the letters themselves, or swallowed by some other letter, each one almost alone on a bright abyss.
“Usually we have five or six scenes and they're a little longer, but the process this year was a little different. We ended up bookending [the recital] with two monologues,” co-producer Lindsay T. McAuliffe ’20 said.
Before the show, the Shakira “Zootopia” song, “Try Everything,” and “Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)” played. An actor in a white puffer shirt on a piano bench in the back lip synced, then sashysheyed, swiveling his chest as he went. His head did not bop.
Pyramus and Thisbe and the wall from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” entered in what resembled Halloween costumes, Thisbe’s dress unzipped. The wall, the actor whose head was not bopping earlier, draped himself in a vampire robe. The lion, in a pink turtleneck and jeans, reclined in cat pose on all-fours. Occasionally, the director, Andrew M. Solomons, a student at the Harvard Extension School, intercepted with lines and asked for a repeat.
Thisbe french-kissed the wall’s hand, cupped donut-like. The wall stood still.
“I would practice kissing around. But tonight was the night I decided to actually kiss the guy's hand,” said Caty L. Vigil ’21, who played Thisbe.
“Roar,” the lion (Cecilia R. Trujillo ’21) said.
“I told [the lion] to either be incredibly timid or incredibly confident. She does timid pretty well,” Solomons said. “I told everyone to take themselves as seriously as possible.”
The stage turned black in transition. The actors threw off their costumes, crawled onto the floor, and moved a stool for King Richard to sleep on to center stage in preparation for the scene from “Richard III.”
After the wall from the “Pyramus and Thisbe” scene fed Richard III wine like a dog. Richard III’s head collapsed. Stock horror sounds played. Actor Jeremy Ornstein ’23, in a peasant blouse and curly, frazzled hair, ran from the dark walls blocking out the crew. A strobe-light slideshow displayed Ghost of Clarence, then Ghost of Rivers, then Ghost of Grey, then Ghost of Vaughan. Ornstein caught his breath after the Ghost of Lord Hastings and rose into a screechy falsetto. The falsetto heightened, now the Ghost of Lady Anne.
“Now fills thy sleep with perturbations. To-morrow in the battle think on me!” Ornstein said.
The Ghost of Lady Anne jumped. A pixelated illustration of teepees, then a cartoon from “The New Yorker” about dogs, revealed itself. About to face his final battle, King Richard hunched over, reading the script.
“I shall despair,” Vigil, portraying Richard III, said.
“Richard III would be in Adams because, first of all, it's a bit castle-like and, second of all, he's quite thinky and has a chip on his shoulder about prestige. He would probably like being in one of those more well-known, older houses,” Vigil said after the show.
Another actor lurched over from under the table, took a sip from the bowl, then finished off the wine, an action Harvard University discourages in the wake of coronavirus, per University email.
“Oh no, we're not afraid of coronavirus in the theatre,” Vigil said.
“We're really inclusive and we just want people to be a part of this fun Shakespeare event,” McAuliffe said.
She provided an elbow bump, per former university protocol.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1996, actor Andrew Heckler was stunned to come across a newspaper article detailing the newly-opened KKK Museum and Redneck Shop in Laurens, South Carolina. Twenty years later, Heckler’s directorial debut, “Burden,” tells the true story of the KKK Museum and how its founder, Mike Burden (Garrett Hedlund), renounced the Klan with the help of Black Baptist Minister Reverend David Kennedy (Forest Whitaker) who preached a message of fighting hate with love. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Heckler about how going undercover in the KKK to research for "Burden" motivated his storytelling.
Note: the following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: When you were introduced to the story of Mike Burden, Reverend Kennedy, and the KKK Museum, did you know that you wanted to make a film about it?
Andrew Heckler: I read a blurb in a little newspaper and it said, “Klan opens KKK Museum in small southern town.” And I thought that was insane in 1996. I thought that kind of overt bigotry and racism happened in the 1950s, 1960s. So I put that article away and I thought I’d get back to it, but before I did there was another article that came out a year later that said, “Klansman sells Redneck Shop and KKK Museum to Black Baptist minister,” and I thought that was nuts. So I called the Reverend (Kennedy), I went down and spent about ten days in Laurens, South Carolina, at the church, getting to know him and the congregation. I subsequently went back undercover as a white supremacist in the Klan, which was challenging for me personally, but was important to the story I was telling because "Burden" isn't a good-and-evil story. It's a story about people, and I had to understand the people I was talking about.
THC: This is a hefty film for any filmmaker, let alone a first-time director. Were you ever scared while filming?
AH: You know what’s funny? Not really. I never felt fear. We filmed in 2016 in the run-up to the election in a small southern town in Georgia so we had a couple of run-ins where there was some fear among the African American community that was part of our family of filming “Burden.” Nothing happened, thankfully. We had to build a KKK Museum and Redneck Shop set, and it was unnerving to have people trying to shop there for real.
THC: Was the approach of empathetic understanding towards Mike Burden, a character who commits evil deeds, an active choice on your part?
AH: Yeah, I think people are taught racism; no one comes out of the womb as a racist, and mostly the people whose lives are hijacked by bigotry and racism are vulnerable. Mike Burden is such a tough, tough guy. You’d never think of him as vulnerable, but, truthfully, due to economics, family, and massive amounts of abuse as a child, he was so longing for any sort of acceptance that he thought he found a family. It’s just that families built on hate go skin-deep, but families built on love go all the way to the heart, and they’re tougher. So, was I trying to empathize with him? Absolutely. Was I trying to sympathize with him? No.
THC: I was struck by Garrett Hedlund’s performance. But really all of the performances in this film are so powerful and real. As an actor-turned-director, were you very hands-on with your actors’ processes?
AH: Everybody on the set was such an incredibly talented actor. As a director, I think my job was to be there for support — to respect them, to hear them, and to make them comfortable enough with me and the story that they could give those performances freely. That's what I wanted when I was acting. I never encourage anybody to be subtle. I think there’s too much safety in acting these days. My favorite actors are those who take risks, and Garrett (Hedlund) came with so much stuff that I just encouraged him — this performance, for me, is one for the ages. That also goes for everybody. Forest obviously doesn’t need to do things like this, but he was so giving and so willing to work with me. Tom Wilkinson (Tom Griffin) was the same. We all met the real characters, but Andrea Riseborough, who played Judy, literally inhaled her character and became her. Even Usher (Clarence Brooks) was such a force in this movie.
THC: Did the real-life Mike Burden and Reverend Kennedy see this film?
AH: They all really loved the movie. I think they’re very private people and were very reticent of this particular story getting out there. In fact, Mike used to scratch his head when I wanted to do it. He’d go, “I don’t understand why anybody would want to make a movie about my life, but okay.” I think that they are humble, but also very happy for this moment in time. These guys did something that has resonance and can create change. As Mike says, “It’s hard for me to look at the movie, but I’m going to. And it’s okay now because the guy in the movie is dead.” He’s dead and buried, so he (Mike Burden) doesn’t have the same reaction he used to.
THC: What comes next for you?
AH: I’m working on a couple of projects. One is a slightly bigger movie around stock car racing with producer-director Peter Berg who did “Friday Night Lights.” My passion project, my next film, is on the opioid crisis. I ended up going down to the West Virginia-Kentucky border after filming “Burden” with a great guy named Jim Cagle, who was one of the first lawyers to sue the opioid companies. I heard this amazing story that showed the real victims of this crisis, which are people who have been left behind with horrific drug addictions.

A second Harvard affiliate has tested “presumptive positive” for COVID-19, according to an email sent by Harvard University Health Services director Giang T. Nguyen.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow informed Harvard affiliates of the first presumptive positive case in an email sent Friday afternoon. The two cases are connected — Nguyen wrote Monday that “this person was tested based on close contact with the individual who received a positive test result on Friday.” A presumptive positive case means the test is pending confirmation testing from the Centers for Disease Control.
Nguyen also wrote that the second person Bacow referenced in his initial email who underwent screening tested negative for the virus.
As fears of contracting coronavirus rise, some Harvard undergraduates have begun speculating about potential cases at the College in Facebook groups and — before students vacated campus — in dining halls.
Neither Bacow’s Friday email nor Monday’s update gave information about the two cases other than noting their University ties. Nguyen underscored Harvard’s rationale for shielding the patients’ information, writing that the University believes maintaining their anonymity is “paramount.”
The local Department of Public Health is overseeing contact tracing efforts to determine whether the people who tested presumptive positive have interacted with other Harvard affiliates. Nguyen wrote that health officials will inform those individuals.
“If you have not been notified, then you are not deemed to have increased risk because of exposure to these individuals,” he wrote.

Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 ordered all restaurants and bars to close on-premise consumption beginning Tuesday, marking one of the most drastic measures yet taken by the state to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Speaking at the Massachusetts State House Sunday, Baker announced the state would close all schools, ban gatherings of more than 25 people, and limit restaurants to just takeout and delivery services.
The measures will last for at least three weeks. The new order does not affect pharmacies and grocery stores.
“This is about bars and restaurants and those places that people do not absolutely have to go,” Baker said.
“I was really thankful,” John F. Schall, the co-owner of the popular Harvard Square Mexican restaurant El Jefe’s, said of Baker’s announcement. “I was so glad that it happened. The only disappointing part of it was it didn’t happen nationwide.”
El Jefe’s was scheduled to open a second location near Emerson College on March 28, but Schall said the launch has been pushed back due to the virus.
“The important thing is to stop the human interaction in a way that allows us to know in a two- or three-week period of time who has this virus and who doesn’t, and then to treat the people that have it,” Schall said. “That’s sort of what this is all about doing.”
As of Monday, there are 197 confirmed coronavirus patients in Massachusetts, including at least seven Cambridge residents.
The city announced Monday night that it would close all playgrounds, parks, fields, and courts. All city offices except for the Cambridge Police Department will also close to the public. The city will also bar establishments with a license to serve alcohol on premise from doing so until April 5.
At his press conference Sunday, Baker said restaurants must “follow social distancing protocols” from the Massachusetts Department of Health.
Schall said he took further measures to encourage state-wide policies. El Jefe’s put out floor tape marking where customers should stand in order to keep a six-foot social distance, which is recommended by the Center for Disease Control.
“We’re trying to make sure we do everything possible in the restaurant in terms of keeping people six feet apart, even if they’re in line for takeout,” Schall said.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she expects Square eateries staying open will lessen the impact on local grocery stores.
“Can you imagine what would happen to Shaw’s if suddenly there weren’t any of these little eateries available and everybody was at Shaw’s?” She said. “That just wouldn’t make sense at all.”
Jillson added she is confident the state and federal government will provide assistance to workers in the midst of the crisis.
“I think the biggest thing is no longer economics, but it’s health,” she said. “The economics piece, I do believe, is going to be taken care of.”
El Jefe’s, which opened in 2015, will continue to stay open for takeout and delivery. Although Baker’s order has yet to take effect, it has already removed the tables and chairs from its Mt. Auburn Street location.
“This is the only way we’re going to get this under control — having everybody sort of stop,” Schall said of the restrictions. “As much of a hit as it is, to not support this is just being shortsighted. This is what has to be done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donors and billionaires Glenn R. Dubin and Leslie H. Wexner departed from a Harvard Kennedy School board last month, foregrounding students’ concerns regarding Harvard’s ties to donors who cultivated relationships with deceased sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.
As early as Feb. 11, Dubin and Wexner’s names no longer appeared on a Harvard website listing members of the advisory council of the Center for Public Leadership, a scholarship and co-curricular program affiliated with the Kennedy School. Wexner co-chaired the council with his wife, Abigail S. Wexner, whose name has also been removed from the website.
The Kennedy School also removed Dubin’s name from the Dean’s Executive Board, which boasts some of “the most committed financial supporters” to the school who serve as “trusted advisors” to Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, according to the board’s website.
Dubin and Wexner have each endowed fellowships in their names at the Center, which provides funding for fellows to study at the Kennedy School and cultivates “principled, effective public leaders,” according to its website.
In 2010, Dubin donated $5 million to establish the Dubin Graduate Fellowship for Emerging Leaders at the Center. Wexner, who helped found the Center in 2000 with his wife, had donated more than $42 million to Harvard as of 2012. He also boasts a building with his name on the Kennedy School’s campus.
In addition to their ties to Harvard, Dubin and Wexner also had relationships with Epstein, the former Harvard donor and financier who earned national ignominy for allegedly running a sex trafficking ring that solicitied girls as young as 14. Last summer, Dubin became implicated in the Epstein scandal after a woman said Epstein forced her to have sex with Dubin, according to recently unsealed court documents.
For decades, Epstein served as Wexner’s personal financial advisor. Wexner has since asserted that he severed ties with Epstein once allegations surfaced in 2007 that Epstein solicited sex from a minor — allegations for which Epstein pleaded guilty in a Florida court. Aside from his ties to Epstein, Wexner, who served as CEO of Victoria Secret’s parent company L Brands until Feb. 20, allegedly created a workplace culture that enabled sexual misconduct to persist for decades, according to news reports.
Center for Public Leadership spokesperson Lael S. Harris confirmed in an email that Wexner and Dubin no longer serve on the Center’s leadership council. She also indicated that the scratching of the billionaires’ names from the website is nothing out of the ordinary.
“Members of the advisory councils within the School often rotate out after a period of time,” Harris wrote. “The membership of those councils is posted publicly on the websites of the relevant research centers.”
Spokespeople for Dubin and Wexner did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Earlier this month, Harvard students called on the University to address its relationship to those donors in an article published by Business Insider. In the article, a student described the discomfort students who have their funding tied to those individuals harbor.
Kennedy School student Katherine C. Williams told The Crimson that because Harvard did not publicly acknowledge Wexner and Dubin’s departures from the council, she was left wondering if the change in leadership reflected Harvard’s severing of ties to those donors or merely “a surface level change.”
“Does that mean that they are no longer funders?” she asked. “Does it mean that the school [has] meaningfully altered its relationship with these individuals?”
Williams said she believes the Kennedy School’s relationships with Wexner and Dubin run counter to its mission.
“HKS is all about public service. It's about leadership, ethics, integrity,” she said. “It just struck me as concerning or like a point of tension that we espouse all of those values as a school and we seek to train and educate future public leaders but we have these ties.”
Another Kennedy School student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from the Kennedy School, said Harvard must realize the legitimacy it bestows individuals who donate to the University. The student called on Harvard to “realize its own worth” and put in place moral standards for donors.
Williams also said she would feel reassured if Harvard administrators acknowledged questions regarding donors’ conduct.
In an email sent to fellowship applicants on Feb. 7 and obtained by The Crimson, the Center relayed an expectation to applicants that they research the donors funding their prospective programs.
“Before submitting your application/s, we expect that you have thoroughly reviewed all pertinent information related to the fellowship/s you have applied to,” Center for Public Leadership staff member Brandon Ward wrote in the email. That information, he went on to specify, includes "the history and background of the donor.”
Last month, discomfort about Harvard’s ties to donors who cultivated relationships with Epstein came out into the open at the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics.
At a forum honoring #MeToo movement founder Tarana Burke, Williams — who attended the discussion — asked Burke how Harvard should grapple with those ties during the questions and answers portion of the evening.
Burke, sitting alongside the event’s moderator, Center for Public Leadership Director Wendy R. Sherman, told the audience that Harvard should acknowledge donors’ ties to Epstein, according to a video stream of the event.
“Courage in a lot of places, especially institutions, looks like transparency,” she said. “Harvard is an example for other institutions: this is how you do this. You look it dead in the eye and say ‘we made a mistake’ or ‘we took too long’ or whatever the thing is but ‘here’s what we’re going to do going forward.’ And I hope that happens.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow apologized for Harvard’s past dealings with Epstein in a September email to University affiliates. Bacow also announced the launch of a probe into Epstein’s donations to Harvard.
In addition to the recent removal of Dubin and the Wexners from the Center’s leadership council, the updated website also omits reference to the Wexner couple as the founders of the Center. It now includes a sentence explaining that council members often “rotate out after a period of time,” as Harris noted in her email.
Leon D. Black, a graduate of Harvard Business School whose professional dealings with Epstein have also come under scrutiny, remains on the Center’s leadership council, per its website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Research labs at the Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Harvard School of Public Health, and Boston Children’s Hospital will be mothballed except for essential functions for between two weeks and two months due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
These labs had previously been spared from some of the closures and cancellations announced by the University last week, which included shifting all courses to online instruction, requiring undergraduates to leave dormitories by Sunday, and shuttering Faculty of Arts and Sciences research labs.
In addition, the Medical School cancelled its in-person Match Day ceremony scheduled for this Friday — an annual tradition when fourth-year medical students learn where they will spend their residency.
Administrators from each of the three schools wrote a joint email to affiliates of the three schools Friday that principal investigators should develop a plan to “ramp down” laboratory research by March 18, and expect to remain in “period of low productivity” for six to eight weeks.
In a follow-up email to Medical School affiliates Saturday, Dean George Q. Daley wrote that he understood concerns over loss of research productivity, but warned of the “devastating consequences” that could ensue without social distancing.
“As a scientist, I found it difficult to deliver this message to my own lab,” Daley wrote. “But as a physician and steward for this community weighing the grim reports I’m reading from colleagues in Seattle and Italy, I believe the recommendation to shutter our labs is in our collective best interest.”
“There are vanishingly few experiments that take precedence over life and death in our community,” Daley added.
Daley added that a small number of individuals would be allowed access to each lab for “critical needs,” such as taking care of animals, replacing liquid nitrogen, and ensuring the “stability of experimental material.” Researchers studying COVID-19 will receive an exception from the closure.
Daley wrote that a transition to working in shifts would not be enough to prevent the spread of the disease.
“A single infected person will leave a trail of virus,” Daley wrote. “Given that surface contamination is a major mode of transmission, shift workers will be unwittingly exposed.”
On Monday, Boston Children’s Hospital administrators announced the same measures for affiliated basic and translational researchers. Rather than six weeks, the Children Hospital’s closure is only effective through March 31, at which time it may be adjusted or extended.
Louis Robert “Bobby” Hollingsworth IV, who works in a lab at the Children’s Hospital, said his lab will only be “maintaining cell lines and other key reagents” throughout the closure and will not be conducting any experiments.
“No one really has the kind of data they would need to have six to eight weeks of being able to be productive,” Hollingsworth said. “It’s really going to be a huge productivity hit to every single person in lab.”
Hollingsworth said some colleagues in his lab have been freezing cell lines to continue after the hiatus, though they will have to wait for these to thaw once labs re-open.
“It’ll take at least two weeks to get back up and running to thaw the cells they need for the research and then get them healthy and up and running and ready for experimentation,” Hollingsworth said.
Beyond the lab closures, the Medical School also cancelled its annual Match Day festivities. On Match Day, a national program matches fourth-year medical students with hospitals around the country, where they are legally bound to spend their three to seven years of residency.
Typically, students at Harvard gather with family and friends at a Medical School building to open envelopes that reveal their destination one hour before they are revealed by the digital system.
Instead, this year will mark the Medical School’s “first-ever virtual Match Day,” according to an email to fourth-year students from Dean for Students Fidencio Saldana. Students will receive an email with their match assignments — still one hour before they are revealed nationwide — and will have the option of posting videos of individual celebrations to an Instagram account, according to Saldana’s email.
Fourth-year medical student Muhammad Sarib Hussain ’15 said that while he and his peers were “disappointed” that the event was cancelled, there was a “dual recognition” of their role as medical professionals in training.
“The audience was such that they understood the nature of the crisis as well,” Hussain said. “As future physicians, we sort of have this responsibility on ourselves to minimize any further spread of coronavirus.”
Hussain added that there has even been discussion among his fellow fourth-year students regarding volunteering to provide medical care if current hospital staff are overwhelmed. Last week, the United Kingdom’s Medical Schools Council urged schools to provisionally license final year students so that they can join the workforce without delay.
Hussain said he traveled home to Pakistan to be with loved ones when he learns of his match. He said that Medical School administrators have been “super supportive” throughout the week and held daily Zoom calls to answer students’ questions.
“They’ve just been running the full 24-hour clock for us, which has been super appreciated,” Hussain said.
