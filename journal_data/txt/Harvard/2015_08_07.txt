After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With more than 20 presidential primary campaigns now in full swing, Harvard students and recent graduates have flocked to the 2016 campaign trail this summer, knocking on doors and dialing phones around the country for the candidates of their choice.
For Daniel R. Ki ’15, an organizer for the Hillary Clinton campaign and a former president of the Harvard College Democrats, working on the campaign trail means long hours and meeting with individual voters in the nooks and crannies of various towns in New England.
Ki, who lives in supporter housing in the critical primary state of New Hampshire, said a “typical day” at his job doesn’t exist—from meeting voters in various coffee shops to organizing phone banks and canvassing outings, every day poses the unexpected. One day, he even had to meet voters in the middle of a thunderstorm.
“We want to meet voters wherever they are, and if it happens to be pouring rain outside, then we’ll do that, too,” he said.
Clinton, a former secretary of state and the favorite to win the Democratic Party’s nomination, faces challenges from four other major candidates, prominent among them U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And recent news reports suggest that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is considering throwing his hat in the ring, too. 
Ross C. Svenson ’15, another Clinton organizer based in Lebanon, N.H., has no office, and instead perches at various coffee shops and cafes to get the day’s work done. The best part of the job, Svenson said, is the chance to interact with local voters.
“The people I’ve met here have incredible stories,” he said.
Meanwhile, on the Republican side, students have a wider choice in candidates to support. Seventeen major candidates have declared their intent to seek the Grand Old Party’s nomination, from the loud and controversial billionaire Donald J. Trump to Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and brother and son to former presidents.
Like many other volunteers, Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, a regional chair at Students for Rubio, has also spent the summer in New Hampshire, setting up offices at various colleges and universities throughout the Northeast in support of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. It’s part of an effort to form a network of college students around the country in support of the candidate’s bid for the Republican Party’s nomination.
Khansarinia’s job includes making sure that each state, region, and school has a respective coordinator. “For the time being, it’s a lot of getting the structure in place,” he said.
Kent Haeffner ’18, who is spending the summer training for the upcoming swim season and working on the Bush campaign, also said a lot of his work has involved setting up basic campaign structure.
Khansarinia added that the large number of Republican candidates in the race can make it hard for individual people to choose their allegiances. He originally planned to work for U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, but he changed his mind after hearing Rubio’s campaign announcement speech.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics announced on Thursday its fall class of resident and visiting fellows, which will include Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy R. Sherman and longtime CNN anchor Candy A. Crowley.
The six resident fellows—former Assistant to the Secretary of Defense Brent Colburn, Crowley, former Republican National Committee communications director Doug Heye, former South African opposition leader Lindiwe Mazibuko, Sherman, and former Mesa, Ariz., mayor Scott Smith—will join the IOP in September to host study groups and office hours for students. Sherman, a top negotiator in the recently announced nuclear deal with Iran, will also serve as a senior fellow at the Kennedy School of Government’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs during her time on campus.
Eric R. Andersen, the director of the IOP’s fellows and study groups program, highlighted Mazibuko and Sherman’s international experience as a diversifying aspect of this semester’s slate of fellows.
“In different ways and in different degrees, what we have here is a collection of leaders…whether it be in public affairs, journalism, serving as an officeholder, [or] as a diplomat,” Andersen said.
While the topics of the study groups are still under development, Andersen said they would draw from the fellows’ practical and professional expertise. Smith, for instance, will likely focus on leadership and government innovation at the local level, and Mazibuko could offer an opportunity for students to understand the South African parliamentary system, Andersen said.
“We’re going to focus on government that works,” said Smith, who is also a former president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. “In today’s world, we see gridlock, we see overall dissatisfaction with government, except at the city level—mayors are getting things done, and that’s unfortunately sort of unique in today’s world.”
Smith also said he hoped to share with students his unique perspective as someone who entered the political sphere later in life, given his career as an accountant and real estate home-builder before serving as a mayor.
Heye, who also served as deputy chief of staff for former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor, said he was developing a supplemental workshop for his crisis communications study group. After spending several sessions examining how political flashpoints in the past have been managed, students will handle their own simulated crises.
Also joining the IOP in the fall are two visiting fellows, former Obama pollster Cornell Belcher and former New York Daily News Washington Bureau Chief Thomas M. DeFrank.
Unlike resident fellows, who are selected by IOP staff and its undergraduate student advisory committee in a competitive application process every semester, visiting fellows are selected by invitation and generally spend only a few days on campus, according to Andersen.

Breaking news: If you got into Harvard, there’s a good chance you wrote a really sad essay, maybe about your parents.
Or so says AdmitSee, a college counseling startup. The group recently analyzed thousands of college essays, and from their findings, we can glean some advice for prospective applicants—and perhaps say something about our peers who already got in.
Specifically, based on what AdmitSee co-founder Stephanie Shyu told Fast Company, we suggest that you call your parents “mother” and “father” if you want to come here. If Palo Alto is more your thing, call them “mom” and “dad.”
Not only are Harvard essays about our parents—they’re also just really sad. According to Fast Company, other keywords in Harvard essays include “difficult,” “cancer,” and “tough,” while our friends at Stanford generally chose to write about their passions, using words like “better,” “happy,” and “improve.”
The bottom line? Harvard applicants, you can be completely void of emotion as long as you have a really padded resume and a tearjerker of a college essay. (Harvard students: That explains a lot.)
