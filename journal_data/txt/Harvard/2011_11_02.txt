After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The General Education requirement in Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding is meant to develop “the ability to interpret forms of cultural expression,” and any one of the department of Romance Languages and Literatures’ excellent courses in Spanish literature does just that. It is nonsense, then, that a concentrator or secondary field recipient in Romance Languages and Literatures would be unable to satisfy his or her Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding education requirement without venturing outside of the RLL department.
Yet not a single Spanish literature course fulfills the AIU Gen Ed category (or, indeed, any other General Education requirement), nor can students petition to receive General Education credit for a course, as was possible under the previous Core Program. The Core Program, itself notoriously burdensome, at least exempted students from requirements that were part and parcel with their concentrations, but the Gen Ed program permits no such maneuvering. Instead, the student of Spanish literature will have to use one of his or her 32 precious course slots on one of a small, arbitrarily selected pool (just 20 of this semester’s courses satisfy the AIU requirement) of approved General Education courses. These courses are often taken by uninterested students in need of a Gen Ed credit. A large number of uninterested students concentrated in a small number of courses, predictably, results in intellectual disaster. The Program in General Education, aiming to cultivate intellectual curiosity, effectively accomplishes precisely the opposite.
I considered concentrating in Spanish, but when I realized how little flexibility the Gen Ed system would leave in my schedule, I decided against it. This demonstrates yet another flaw in the Program in General Education: Undergraduates are compelled to populate their schedules with courses that they have to take rather than ones that interest them. I often find myself browsing courses in departments that I have never explored but would very much like to explore. “Do they satisfy a Gen Ed?,” I ask myself. More often than not, the answer is no, and I instead choose to enroll in a Gen Ed for fear of neglecting my burdensome requirements.
Moreover, the philosophy of the Program in General Education is inconsistent with the aims of a liberal education. The program promises to “link the arts and sciences with the 21st century world that students will face,” and it hopes to do so by applying “ basic [academic] concepts and principles to the solution of concrete problems.” Yet the philosophy of a liberal education maintains that the liberal arts are valuable in and of themselves, that a liberal education necessarily makes us better citizens, and that to justify an education with external criteria is to devalue and misrepresent the aims of scholarship. We need not introduce additional, cumbersome material to liberal arts courses to ensure that they will benefit us as thinkers and as citizens. Nor should we water down the liberal arts with unnecessarily defensive, self-defeating criteria. It is downright shameful that Harvard, one of the world’s premier liberal arts colleges, has flouted this basic principle of education.
Because of the inflexibility of the Gen Ed system, instructors are required to design their courses to accommodate the guidelines of the program.  The system, which asks that instructors petition to have their courses satisfy General Education requirements, gets it backward.  Rather, faculty should not be asked to make their material adhere to rigid and often irrelevant criteria; courses should be determined to fulfill the requirements of undergraduates on an ad hoc basis.
The College should do away with a system that does a disservice to both undergraduates and faculty by replacing General Education with general education. Harvard should instate a general education program similar to Yale’s: two courses each in the humanities and arts, social sciences, sciences, and no nonsense. Until such a change is made, faculty can help mitigate some of the negative effects of Gen Ed by petitioning, to the greatest extent possible, to include their courses in the Gen Ed curriculum. This will ensure the greatest possible flexibility for both undergraduates and professors. The Committee on General Education should also consider actively reviewing all courses for Gen Ed credit rather than asking that faculty take the initiative. Finally, the Committee should permit undergraduates  more lenience in petitioning to receive Gen Ed credit for courses not yet included in the program.
With its senselessly rigid criteria the Program in General Education betrays the aims of the liberal arts. Harvard bears the responsibility of reforming a system that is as logistically problematic as it is frustratingly anti-intellectual.

Current legislative attempts to reduce online piracy in the United States suffer from a lack of focus. The PROTECT–IP Act, proposed in the Senate earlier this year, and the more recent Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), proposed in the House last week, each attempts to shut down non-P2P services and methods of content delivery outright. These bills’ blunt approach ignores the users who knowingly upload copyrighted works to such websites without compensating artists. Due to the nature of how content is shared over the Internet, such legislation will be ultimately unsuccessful. Requiring online storage sites to make sure piracy does not occur on their websites would be a more practical solution, and Congress would be wiser to modify their approach to an end-user focus. In addition, online non-P2P piracy in the United States should be acknowledged as occurring primarily with the aid of companies based internationally. Therefore, in tandem with domestic policy, diplomatic pressure should be placed on the “piracy havens” which harbor such companies.
The PROTECT–IP Act and SOPA both aim at disabling the effectiveness of sites “Dedicated to Theft of U.S. Property,” as the SOPA puts it in Section 103. If people were unlawfully obtaining copyrighted material through such “dedicated theft sites,” the problem of piracy could have been easily solved long ago using the same techniques of payment deprivation currently being applied with success to Wikileaks. This is the process both the PROTECT-IP Act and SOPA attempt to enshrine in law for greater ease with future cases of copyright infringement. Though the intention to shut down sites through which infringement occurs is laudable, the unilateral approach both bills take does not acknowledge the complexity of how online infringement most commonly takes place.
It is unproductive for legislators to ask which websites are “dedicated to theft of U.S. property,” as the question will not yield clear answers. Neither the PROTECT-IP Act nor SOPA would be able to take down the most popular sites through which the vast majority of non-P2P piracy of movies and music takes place. Such websites are online storage websites termed “cyber lockers;” Examples include the well-known Rapidshare and Megaupload sites, operated from Switzerland and Hong Kong, respectively. Besides being based outside the United States, these sites can be used by anyone to upload anything to be downloaded by anyone and therefore cannot be accused of being “dedicated to theft.” As with regular theft, Congress must realize that outlawing a method of transporting or storing stolen materials cannot solve online piracy.
Rather than taking the misguided approach that the PROTECT – IP Act and SOPA both take, Congress must recognize that they can only successfully target copyright infringers. Only three options exist for Congress to do so: The government must require copyright holders to enforce the law, the government itself must enforce the law, or the “cyber lockers” must be required to enforce the law. Currently, copyright holders are primarily required to enforce the law. If informed by a copyright holder of a case of infringement, “cyber lockers” are required to take down any infringing files.
Obviously, few copyright holders can afford to take the trouble to scour the Internet for such files. The government does not possess the resources to combat piracy on such a large scale either. The only logical solution is to entrust the responsibility of copyright enforcement to the “cyber lockers” and to coordinate diplomatically such an approach with the authorities of the locales in which “cyber lockers” are located.
Pirates who download a music album from a website like Megaupload are exactly like thieves who steal CDs from stores—except that there are no security cameras to catch them in the act. The government must require “cyber lockers” to undertake the dirty work of policing piracy on an individual level. Internet Service Providers in the United States should be required by law to block access to any “cyber lockers” which refuse to undertake such copyright surveillance on their sites. The government should approach this problem similarly to its aggressive stance toward the use of Swiss banks as offshore tax havens. This means that, while passing domestic law that requires such behavior, the government should also place diplomatic pressure on Switzerland, Hong Kong,and any other “piracy havens” to enforce the same protocol.
The methods of law enforcement advocated by the PROTECT-IP Act and SOPA are inefficient and ineffective. In order to stop piracy, law must require the “cyber lockers” that have facilitated piracy until now to take upon themselves the responsibility to target content uploaders who infringe on copyright. Since the Internet is a global arena, only global approaches to law enforcement will work in combating piracy. This necessitates a mix of well-thought out domestic policy and carefully placed diplomatic pressure in order to eliminate the use of “cyber lockers” for piracy. Only when the problem of non-P2P piracy has been acknowledged in its full complexity and on a global scale will it finally be stopped.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the last few weeks, I’ve had the opportunity to get out of Washington and talk with folks across the country about how we can create jobs and get our economy growing faster.
This is a tough time for a lot of Americans—especially young people. You’ve come of age at a time of profound change. The world has gotten more connected, but it’s also gotten more competitive.  And for decades, too many of our institutions—from Washington to Wall Street—failed to adapt, culminating in the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.
For the last three years, we’ve worked to stabilize the economy, and we’ve made some progress. But we still have a long way to go. And now, as you’re getting ready to head out into the world, many of you are watching your friends and classmates struggle to find work. You’re wondering what’s in store for your future, and I know that can be scary.
The truth is, the economic problems we face today didn’t happen overnight, and they won’t be solved overnight. But the fact that you’re investing in your education right now tells me that you believe in the future of America. You want to be a part of it. And you know that there are steps we can take right now to put Americans back to work and give our economy a boost.
The problem is, there are some in Washington who just don’t share that sense of urgency. That’s why it’s been so disappointing to see Republicans in Congress block jobs bills from going forward—bills that independent economists say could create millions of jobs though the kinds of proposals supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past.
Now, the best way to attack our economic challenges and put hundreds of thousands of people back to work is through bold action in Congress. That’s why I’m going to keep demanding that Members of Congress to vote on common-sense, paid-for jobs proposals.  And I hope you’ll send them a message to do the right thing for your future, and the future of our country.
But we can’t wait for Congress to do its job. So where they won’t act, I will. That’s why, I’ve announced a new policy that will help families whose home values have fallen refinance their mortgages and save thousands of dollars. We made it easier for veterans to get jobs putting their skills to work in hospitals and community health centers.
And at the University of Colorado at Denver, I announced steps we’re taking to make college more affordable and to make it even easier for students like you to get out of debt faster.
Michelle and I know what it feels like to leave school with a mountain of debt. We didn’t come from wealthy families. By the time we both graduated from law school, we had about $120,000 worth of debt between us. And even though we were lucky enough to land good jobs with steady incomes, it still took us almost 10 years to finally pay it all off. It wasn’t easy.
Living with that much debt forces you to make some tough choices. And when a big chunk of every paycheck goes towards student loans, it isn’t just painful for you—it’s painful to our economy and harmful to our recovery.
That’s why we’re making changes that will give about 1.6 million students the ability to cap their loan payments at 10 percent of their income starting next year. We’re also going to take steps to help you consolidate your loans so that instead of making multiple payments to multiple lenders every month, you only have to make one payment a month at a better interest rate. And we want to start giving students a simple fact sheet called “Know Before You Owe” so you can have all the information you need to make your own decision about paying for college. That’s something Michelle and I wish we had.
These changes will make a real difference for millions of Americans. We’ll help more young people figure out how to afford college. We’ll put more money in your pocket after you graduate. We’ll make it easier to buy a house or save for retirement. And we’ll give our economy a boost at a time when it desperately needs it.
That’s not just important for our country right now—it’s important for our future. Michelle and I are where we are today because our college education gave us a chance. Our parents and their generation worked and sacrificed to hand down the dream of opportunity to us.
Now it’s our turn. That dream of opportunity is what I want for my daughters, and for all of you. And even in these tough times, we are going to make that dream real once again.
In the weeks ahead, I’m going to keep doing everything in my power to make a difference for the American people—including young people like you. Because here in America, when we find a problem, we fix it. When we face a challenge, we meet it. We don’t wait. And I hope you’ll join me.

It’s often easy to take for granted the critical role that research conducted on the behalf of the United States Armed Forces has played in the various technological breakthroughs of the last several decades.  Since its inception in 1958, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been responsible for a wide array of groundbreaking innovations, including the internet—the derivative of DARPA’S Advanced Research Projects Agency Network—the Global Positioning System, and Proto 2—a prosthetic arm capable of being controlled by one’s thoughts. The Department of Defense is also at the forefront of research and investment in alternative fuels and other forms of green technology, investing in solar panels, fuel efficient Humvees, and smart microgrids.
In fiscal year 2011, DARPA contributed to 13 percent of all expenditures made by the physics department, using money that came from federal sources. We recognize that in some quarters, the imprimatur of the Defense Department renders these projects categorically suspect. However, given the proven social utility of military research, we believe that it would be a mistake to treat the word “military” as a pejorative and that we should instead celebrate this influx of federal support for the work being done by the physics department here and at other universities.
Such celebration is particularly merited since the Defense Department does not distinguish between projects solely on the basis of applicability. There is little to no evidence suggesting that these funds are being used as leverage by the Defense Department to promote a specific military agenda. Physics professor Gerald Gabrielse, for example, has said that he would never accept funds for research that might be used for questionable purposes. In fact, there is currently no identifiable, practical military purpose for federally funded projects like Gabrielse’s antimatter research, funded in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, or for physics Professor Amir Yacoby’s work on quantum computers and sensitive magnetic sensors, a beneficiary of DARPA. Rather, it is the potential for future applicability that drives the military’s decision-making regarding the doling out of funds for academic research. Defense Department funds do not give the military the ability to dictate the subject of research—only its application.
Furthermore, it would be imprudent to begrudge a physics department that is heavily dependent on federal support a source of funding on the basis of a baseless bias against projects associated with the United States military. As Gabrielse put it: “Defending our country is an honorable and good thing. I regard taking government funds as a sense of trust.”
Of all the external funding that the department receives, a staggering 93 percent comes from the federal government in some form or fashion. Of that 93 percent, a substantial portion is provided by defense-related agencies. In the words of physics Professor Isaac F. Silvera: “The government is our lifeline to carrying out fundamental research.” The research conducted by the physics department—and, indeed, scientific research in general—is an unambiguous benefit to society; we should therefore welcome the federal government’s much-needed support.

Teresa C. Ulloa Ziáurriz began her law career representing trade unions. But after she accepted the request from a group of women to represent several 12- and 13-year-old girls who had been victims of sexual abuse, Ziáurriz began litigating rape cases.
Tuesday evening, the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership honored the activist–who is the current director of the Latin America and Caribbean division of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women–with the Gleitsman International Activist Award for her leadership in the field.
The award ceremony, held at the Kennedy School, was accompanied by a panel discussion about sex trafficking.
Davíd Carrasco, a professor of Latin American studies, and Mary I. Setterholm, a Divinity School student joined Ziáurriz in the conversation.
The three discussed prostitution and sexual exploitation along with the initiatives Ziáurriz has developed during her time with CATW.
Setterholm, a former prostitute and victim of sexual abuse, described the activist and her work as “mercy” for her and other women who had been subjected to sexual violence.
Ziáurriz, who has litigated over 30,000 rape cases, said that the culture of sexual abuse is primarily the result of the media over-sexualizing female bodies.
“What is selling [over-sexualization] to all of us is TV,” she said. “Women are just flesh, skinny flesh.”
The internet, she claimed, allows boys and men access to an unlimited amount of pornography that she said was harmful.
“The internet is a black hole and the law never goes faster than that black hole,” she said.
In her position at CATW, Ziauriz has led programs to reduce incidences of sexual violence.
The organization currently hosts camps for young men and boys to educate them about the negative role of male sexual expression in female prostitution.
Hannah M. Baron ’14 said, “[Ziáurriz’s work] is very much an approach to a solution that directly tries to solve the problem [of prostitution] on the demand side.”
Ziáurriz also emphasized her goal of reforming sex education so that it includes topics beyond simply biological functions.
After receiving her award, Ziáurriz wiped tears from her face, as she thanked the members of CATW and spoke of the survivors of sexual violence and daughter as the motivations for her activism.
In the past, award recipients have included individuals such as Nelson Mandela and Karen I. Tse, founder of International Bridges to Justice.
“To see someone who has saved over 869 children and who has a holistic approach to the problem is empowering,” said Kate Sim ’14, who is the president of Harvard’s International Women’s Rights Collective.

Two faculty members at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are leading an effort funded by the National Science Foundation to better understand the causes of Arctic climate change.
Daniel J. Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering, will be the lead primary investigator for the project, while Loretta J. Mickley, a senior research fellow, will co-lead the research, according to a SEAS press release.
The researchers hope that by studying the atmospheric conditions in the Arctic that they will be able to better understand the specific causes of warming in the region over the past three decades, Mickley said.
Researchers say they will accomplish this goal by developing a global 3D model of the earth’s climate system and atmospheric composition, according to the press release.
The NSF grant, which was publicly announced Monday, provides $477,787 in funding over three years, according to the press release.
Jacob and Mickley, who have been working together for over 15 years, started receiving the funding early this year.
So far they have examined the role of soot particles in Arctic warming, Mickley said.
Soot transported from polluted
areas can be deposited on snow and sea ice.
The soot absorbs solar radiation which accelerates the warming and melting process, Jacob said.
“This is really what we’ve been targeting: non-standard explanations for the warming of the Arctic over the past 30 years,” Jacob said.
“This is very important in order to be able to make projections for the future of what’s going to happen to the Arctic sea ice and the implications for global climate change.”
The Harvard researchers will be sharing the funding with collaborators at the University of Washington.
While the Harvard researchers will focus on atmospheric modeling, the University of Washington scientists will study Arctic sea ice.
At the end of the project, Jacob said that he expects that the results will be used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to explain to world governments “how policies directed at emission and fire control could alter the course of climate change in the Arctic.”
“I think that as we learn what can affect the regional climate of the Arctic, it will help policy makers know what levers to pull and what we should change in the way that we generate power, for example,” Mickley said.
“What is going on up there? Why is the ice declining so rapidly? Those are the type of questions that we want to answer.”

Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig discussed corruption in Congress on Tuesday as part of an effort to promote his new book on the issue, “Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It.”
In addition to serving as director of the Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics, Lessig is a staunch critic of copyright restrictions.
Discussing the book with Lessig was Harvard Kennedy School Professor David R. Gergen, who is currently a senior political analyst at CNN.
Both speakers argued that the corruption we should be concerned with is not necessarily “quid pro quo.”
“The type of corruption we have here is not one of bad souls, but of good souls that are part of a system that perpetuates a focus on what [money] wants and not what the people want,” Lessig said.
During the presentation, Lessig outlined three ways to tackle corruption in Congress.
“Congress must publicly fund public elections, campaign contributions need to be limited, and Congress should limit but not ban independent expenditures,” Lessig said.
During the conversation, Lessig cited a Gallup poll from last August that pegged Congressional approval at all-time low of 13 percent and disapproval at 84 percent.
“We all agree that money buys results in Congress, and that leads to an extraordinary lack of confidence in the system,” Lessig said. “Government needs to recognize that a general lack of confidence in Congress is enough of a reason for reform.”
Lessig also praised the Occupy movement.
“People need to be willing to get involved in their government, and everyone agrees that money shouldn’t be in politics,” Lessig said.
Lessig also cited the founding fathers as a source for inspiration and compromise.
“They were actually radically different people,” Lessig said. “Regardless, they sat together in the same room and saved the Union.”
Lessig also discussed the importance of unity to address the larger issues that affect all of us.
“Politicians profit from us hating each other,” Lessig said. “The media too.”
As part of his effort to limit corruption in Congress, Lessig said he is working to educate others about the issues and help them connect the dots. This was part of his motivation for talking about the issue at Harvard, he said.
“I appreciate how he framed the problem as a group of good people getting caught in a system where money influences decisions,” said James E. Kath, a graduate student in biophysics. “Ragging on politicians and labeling them as evil won’t get us anywhere.”

What makes a relationship successful?
Gian C. Gonzaga, senior research director for eHarmony.com and faculty affiliate at the Interdisciplinary Relationship Science Program at UCLA, sought to answer this question in a seminar last night before a mostly female audience in the Starr Auditorium at the Kennedy School.
Gonzaga is responsible for scientifically designing algorithms for finding compatible partners on the online dating service eHarmony.
“Technology can help us improve our partner selection,” he said at the seminar, titled “The Science of Romantic Choice (or: Why do Fools Fall in Love?).”
Gonzaga commented on the low number of men in the crowd, noting that many online dating services, though not eHarmony, in fact have more male users.
“There is a tendency in American society for women to be more oriented towards relationships than men are,” he said. “Ironically one of the manifestations of that is most dating services have a problem with too many men. Our service is more focused on relationships so we have more women.”
Gonzaga’s presented three studies that suggested that people usually choose partners with similar personalities and subsequently have higher marital satisfaction. He also stated that the assumption that couples who were together long enough begin to become more like each other is false. While their interests converge, their personalities do not, he said.
Gonzaga said that on-line dating now accounts for more marriages than meeting via friends, school, or work.
But Gonzaga in fact met his significant other in a more traditional way.
“I met my wife in the UCLA Marriage Lab. We had to teach people how to interview married couples,” he said. “She and I played a couple that was married for 13 years and after a while we realized it worked pretty well. Eventually we got to know each other and got married.”
Some attendees said they felt that the seminar was too focused on eHarmony.
“It seemed like an eHarmony pitch,” said Camila M. Villanueva, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. “It seemed like it was just going to be about relationships in general.”
Beste Cobek, another student at HGSE, agreed that the discussion focused heavily on eHarmony.
“It was very informative about [his] company and the background that he was coming from, but I would have liked to see some statistics about how successful his method has been,” she said.
But Cobek noted she took away some valuable relationship advice.
“[The seminar] would change where I would look for a relationship,” she said.
The event was organized by the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory, a Harvard-wide research lab that studies decision making,
“One of our goals is to bring people together from different disciplines to focus on the broad topic of decisions research,” said Jennifer S. Lerner, faculty director of the HDSL and organizer of the event.

Over the summer, contractors installed seven new windows—each with different designs, costs, and mechanisms—in Old Quincy in preparation for the mass renovation of the building scheduled to begin in June 2012 as part of the House renewal process.
Contractors will use feedback from students and administrators to determine which windows will be installed in renovated Old Quincy.
According to Stephen L. Needham, the Old Quincy project’s program manager, the final decision on which window to use will be made with an eye towards each design’s energy efficiency, durability, and cost—three principles that administrators have said will inevitably guide construction decisions throughout the entire House renewal project.
“Old Quincy gives us an opportunity to test even things like windows, which allows us to see how they perform and how they stand up,” Needham said.
While Old Quincy has only 300 windows, the River Houses boast a total of 8,000 windows that might need to be replaced by the end of House renewal.
Most windows in Old Quincy have not been replaced since the building was constructed over 80 years ago.
According to Needham, contractors also tested the durability of the plaster and the wood over the summer.
Over the past summer, administrators bought new desks, beds, and dressers for several rooms in Old Quincy—prototypes of what will potentially furnish student rooms in the renovated building.
Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke described the beds as “adjustable,” allowing students to change the space between the bed-frame and the floor to allow for additional storage space.
Gehrke said administrators are also soliciting student opinions on the new furniture. Those comments, as well as feedback regarding the windows, will influence the final design decisions for Old Quincy.
Susie E. Double ’14, whose room has one of the new windows, described the mock-ups as “not very different” from the old windows.
“If anything, they’re aesthetically prettier,” Double said. “And they’re definitely easier to open and close.”
Because contractors are forbidden from changing the exterior of the Harvard Houses due to rules laid out by the Cambridge Historical Commission, the windows must be visually identical to those currently installed in Old Quincy.
Even so, the difference between the old and new windows is noticeable—while the green paint is chipping from the frames of the old windows, the newly installed prototypes shine with a fresh coat of paint.
The renovation of Old Quincy is the first step in Harvard’s ambitious House renewal process that aims to dramatically overhaul the internal structure of Harvard’s 12 residential Houses.
Administrators intend for Old Quincy to serve as a “test project” for future renovations.
Because Quincy contains two buildings, the neo-Georgian Old Quincy and the more modern New Quincy, planners will be able to test their renewal designs while impacting about 180 House residents.
The timeline for the remainder of the House Renewal project has not yet been determined.

A small group of Harvard students and employees staged an “Occupy Speakout” at noon on Tuesday to express their solidarity with the “National Day of Action.”
The group also sought to raise awareness of events they have planned for today, including a walkout of the popular Economics 10 introductory course and a March in Boston later in the day.
“Mic Check! We are the 99 percent across the country!” the group chanted.
The seven Mic Check participants drew attention to several initiatives taking place today, calling on students to join a campus-wide walkout Wednesday. The organizers are planning two separate walkouts—a general walkout at 11:30 a.m. and a walkout from Ec 10 at 12:15 p.m.—before leading students to join a rally in Dewey Square against rising student debt.
“I urge all students to walk out of Ec 10, [because it] represents the ideology that brought about our current economic situation,” shouted organizer Gabriel H. Bayard ’15.
Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, who with Bayard is helping organize the Economics 10 walk-out, said she believes the class pushes a “strongly conservative neoliberal ideology.” She said, for example, that she thought lectures promoted conservative views against minimum wage.
“I think a more diverse viewpoint needs to be raised,” Sandalow-Ash said. “The problem is that in an introductory course, what the professor says is generally taken as fact,” she said.
But some students disagree with the characterization of the class. Harvard Republican Club Secretary Aditi Ghai ’14, who took the class last year, said she doesn’t think the class is biased. “The class is about pure economic efficiency. Ideology comes into play when we determine how to balance efficiency with social equity,” she said.
However, Randi B. Michel ’14, currently enrolled in Ec 10, said that she probably wouldn’t walk out. Despite the “constant underlying layer of extreme conservatism, it would be more effective to meet with the Faculty to express any grievances,” she said.
EC 10 professor N. Gregory Mankiw said that Ec 10 is just “mainstream economics,” adding that his textbooks are used at “hundreds of other schools around the world,” including Princeton, Yale and Brown.
“The goal of economics is to help people evaluate the inevitable tradeoffs that public policy entails,” said Mankiw. “While I do not share the specific views of the Occupy Wall Street movement, I am delighted to see students engaged in thinking broadly about social and economic policy. I hope that Ec 10 can help contribute to [that] ongoing discussion.”
Tuesday’s demonstration was intended to show solidarity with the Occupy protests in Oakland, according to Neil Peterman, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“The whole occupation was brutally attacked,” Peterman said, describing the police’s recent use of tear gas to clear a plaza on Oct. 26. “The basic message of this Mic Check and other events is to stop silencing our movement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Don’t just rely on that apple in the dining hall to keep the doctor away this coming winter.
In preparation for the flu season, Harvard University Health Services is offering free flu shots to Harvard students, faculty, and staff with a valid Harvard ID or Harvard University Group Health Plan card.
“We want to keep the community as healthy as possible throughout the winter,” UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 said. “The more people we can vaccinate, the less risk the entire community has of getting the flu.”
Since Aug. 1, UHS has vaccinated 9,700 people, of which 1,500 were undergraduates, Rosenthal said. Like in previous years, UHS has ordered 15,000 doses of flu vaccine.
A highly contagious viral infection, the flu is easily spread from person to person through talking, sneezing, and coughing.
UHS will administer flu vaccination clinics on Mondays and Tuesdays from 12 to 3 p.m. on the second floor of its building on 75 Mt. Auburn St. through the end of December.
Rosenthal said more students are vulnerable to getting the flu in the winter, when the weather keeps them inside and close to other students.
“Given that students live in close communities and spend many hours together in classrooms, the flu can easily spread quickly through entryways, entire buildings, and classes,” Rosenthal said.
The vaccine, however, is not entirely effective. It is like a game of chance in that each year, scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause illness that year.
“The vaccine does not prevent illness from other viruses, but getting the vaccine significantly decreases your risk of being ill from the viruses that are expected to be most common,” Rosenthal said.
Adeline E. Byrne ’14, a skier on the Nordic Crimson, said she gets the flu shot every year because catching the flu “could ruin my season,” she said.
“I might also get other people sick when I have the flu,” she added.
Byrne said she has yet to find the time to get vaccinated this year, but she plans to do so as soon as her schedule opens up.
Unlike Byrne, Lloyd S. Han ’12 said he never gets the flu shot.
“Basically the flu shot is a guess at which strains will be hitting this season, so it’s not guaranteed to help,” Han said. “And I’m also super lazy.”
Likewise, Ben S. Ory ’14 said he does not get the flu shot, despite getting sick about once every season.
“I don’t like needles, and I’m pretty sure that there are multiple strains of the flu going around at any one time, so I have never felt like it’s worth getting,” Ory said.
Although Rosenthal said most people who get sick from the flu experience only mild illness, those with other medical conditions, such as asthma and diabetes, may experience significant complications from the virus, including pneumonia, bronchitis, or other respiratory infections. He added that there are some fatal cases resulting from these complications each year in the United States.
Rosenthal said protection from the vaccine lasts through the flu season and in most individuals for up to a year.
Symptoms of the flu include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Rosenthal said he advises students who think they have symptoms of the flu to be evaluated at UHS or call to speak with a nurse to get advice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nathan U. Blecharczyk ’05, co-founder and CTO of the $1.3 billion internet startup Airbnb, responded this week to public criticisms from his freshman roommate aimed at himself and Silicon Valley.
Blecharczyk wrote to The Crimson about a blog post in which web entrepreneur Aaron J. Greenspan ’05 criticized what Greenspan described as unethical practices in Silicon Valley that he said were perpetuated by Harvard graduates.
Greenspan also criticized his former Harvard roommate for being involved in email spamming in college. At one point, Blecharczyk was listed as one of the world’s most active email spammers according to an online tracker.
Blecharczyk co-founded Airbnb in 2008, and it has rapidly grown since its inception. The internet startup allows people to rent a bedroom, apartment, or other short-term accommodation from a private party rather than from a commercial hotel.
As Greenspan noted in the post, Blecharczyk’s company has stirred controversy recently for sending spam emails to people advertising vacation rentals on Craigslist.
Company representatives said the emails were sent by an outside company contracted by Airbnb.
Blecharczyk said Silicon Valley companies can run into difficulties in the development phase, but that individual incidents should not characterize the company as a whole.
“Building a business has some similarities to developing a relationship. With both, it is normal to have some bumps, even with the best of individuals,” he said.
“It would be wrong to make these bumps representative of the whole or to say that they happen due to malicious intent versus being a normal part of the development process,” said Blecharczyk.
Blecharczyk also defended Silicon Valley against Greenspan’s criticisms, “vehemently” disagreeing that the technology hub is, as Greenspan described, fraudulent.
“There is nowhere else on this planet with such a high density of individuals who are trying to change the world for the better,” he said.
Blecharczyk also said he thought it was inappropriate for Greenspan to reference Blecharczyk’s past when discussing his current business.
“I don’t think commenting on something that happened over a decade ago is either productive or helpful in this situation,” he said.
But he said he was not put off by his former roommate’s criticism.
“When doing something novel and disruptive, you’ve got to take criticism in stride,” he said.
“It would be a shame if his personal perspective were to cloud others’ perception of Silicon Valley or Harvard,” he said.
In a statement to The Crimson, Greenspan explained his reasons for speaking about Blecharczyk now, ten years after they lived together.
“The point wasn’t just to prove that Nathan did something wrong ten years ago. The point was that ... if no one ever talks about the fraud that everyone in Silicon Valley is constantly knee-deep in (and often has connections to Harvard), nothing will ever change.”
But Blecharczyk also rejected Greenspan’s criticism of Harvard, praising the entrepreneurial spirit on campus.
“I will say that I am impressed with the number of Harvard alums who have started tech companies over the past several years,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three weeks ago Monday, Dan the Bagel Man was urging crowds of protesters to lock arms and resist an impending police raid on a small park across from Dewey Square.
Last Friday, Dan’s distinctive military-style cap, covered in anti-war protest buttons, was still easy to pick out in Occupy Boston’s Tent City. But as the protest approaches its second month, the Bagel Man spends more of his time handing out food and washing dishes.
Dan, whose nickname comes from his former job as a bagel vendor, is one of a few stalwart protesters that have stayed with Occupy Boston since the protest, inspired by demonstrations on Wall Street in New York City, began in Boston’s financial district. But as the protests continue and temperatures drop, many observers question where the Occupy movement is going.
“Is this a moment or a movement?” says Marshall L. Ganz, a senior lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government.
Ganz, who participated in a teach-in at Dewey Square, is one of many in the Harvard Community who have an interest in the protest—at least five Harvard students and alumni were arrested on Oct. 10, the night of the raid. And as the protest closes out its first month, many University professors are weighing in on the relevance and viability of Occupy Wall Street and its Boston counterpart.
‘POLARIZE TO MOBILIZE’
Ganz knows a thing or two about protest movements. He organized for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s, and later worked with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers.
“It’s amazing that there hasn’t been more action,” Ganz says about the underlying reasons that prompted the Occupy protests. He says that he is surprised that the hardships caused by the economic crisis have not precipitated more turbulence.
But, according to Ganz, the current domestic unrest is a positive sign. “You have to polarize to mobilize,” he says, explaining his belief that civil unrest is an essential part of healthy democracy. “The way the public gets educated is through controversy,” says Ganz. “After all, democracy is a constructive form of contention.”
And the “occupiers” have seen plenty of contention. Although the Dewey Square encampment has been more tranquil than its New York City counterpart, Boston Police arrested more than 100 protesters on Oct. 10 after they expanded into a small park across the street. In other parts of the country as well, Occupy protests have come into increasing conflict with the authorities. Last Tuesday, California police broke up Occupy Oakland’s encampment with tear gas and riot gear, leaving one protester with a fractured skull.
CLARIFY THE MESSAGE
In spite of the Occupy movement’s increasing presence in cities across the country, some say the movement lacks specific, attainable goals.
In Dewey Square, wide-ranging, even contradictory, viewpoints have been evident since the beginning. Protesters at the march on Oct. 10 tended to agree that wealth was unfairly distributed in the United States, but they offered a variety of specific grievances.
Ky Merrick, a sophomore at Lesley University who shared a tent with his girlfriend, said that he came to protest unreasonable tuition and student debt.
Matt Cloyd, a recent Dartmouth grad and member of Occupy Boston’s media team, said that he was more concerned with the undue influence of corporations on the electoral politics. Meanwhile, an older man distributed typed lists of grievances addressed to “the fat bastards on top.”
Harvard Business School Associate Professor Noel Maurer says the protesters must clarify their message to have a political impact.
Maurer, whose own brother defaulted on a mortgage after a substantial wage cut, says he thinks Occupy Wall Street should capitalize on economic frustrations to solidify its goals and make its message more accessible.
Suggesting that the movement adopt clear slogans like “Forgive the debt” and “Print more money,” Maurer says that the Occupy movement could do for the Democratic Party what the Tea Party protesters have done for the Republican Party. “It’s nice to have a popular movement to put these things on the table,” he says.
KEEPING OPTIONS OPEN
But Occupy Boston has no intention of embracing a comprehensive manifesto, according to media team volunteer David Lehnart. Lehnart says that determining specific goals would risk alienating certain groups in the movement. In fact, he says, the movement is even further away from narrowing down its goals than it was before the arrests of Oct. 10.
“We’ve only been around for [a few] weeks!” he says, expressing his frustration at media outlets that, in his opinion, are trying to project a political platform on Occupy Boston too early in its development. Lehnart says that Occupy Boston plans to stick around “indefinitely,” whether or not it adopts a specific political plan of action.
HKS Adjunct Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy, who has made several visits to Occupy Boston and Occupy Wall Street, agrees. As a historian of American protest movements, McCarthy says that it is unrealistic to demand a “10 point plan” from the occupiers.
“Social movements are, by definition, oppositional,” he says. “You have to articulate what you’re against first.” According to McCarthy, the wide variety of messages on display at Occupy Boston “doesn’t suggest that the movement is incoherent” but rather that “our country is screwed up in many ways.”
Moreover, he says that Occupiers should be wary of attempts by the Democratic party to “co-opt” the movement for political purposes. “I want the President to come to Occupy and not the other way around,” he says.
DON’T TREAD ON ME
Many of the details visible around the camp reinforce claims that Occupy Boston plans to be a permanent protest unaffiliated with a political party. In the first week of demonstrations, protesters planted a resin, larger-than-life-sized statue of Mahatma Ghandi in the middle of Dewey Square.
Occupiers continue to invoke the legacy of historical protest movements and leaders. Quotes from Martin Luther King and Progressive Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis adorn many signs. Several demonstrators carry well known symbols of the American Revolution—especially the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag once used by colonial troops.
All this is in keeping with American traditions of democracy, according to Harvard History Professor James Kloppenberg. While Kloppenberg says that “you can go back to the American Revolution” for examples of democratic protest, he sees particular parallels between the “amorphous” goals of the Occupy movement and the broad objectives of early 20th century Progressive reformers.
“There has been a tension throughout American history between direct democracy and representative democracy,” Kloppenberg says. “A healthy and productive tension.”
And yet, on most days, Dewey Square seems remarkably free of tension. Most of the chanting in Tent City now comes from Buddhists in the “Spiritual Space Tent,” not from protesters standing on the street. The same organizers that urged protesters to link arms against the police three weeks ago now hand out cough drops and Vitamin C, though they still cover their faces with bandannas.
Last Friday, one of the first days in October with a high below 50◦, comparatively few occupiers stirred from their tents. Dan the Bagel Man had to hunt for volunteers to carry water jugs, move furniture, and empty dishwater.
This trend concerns Ganz, the former affiliate of Cesar Chavez. While Ganz says he thinks Occupy Wall Street has already captured a powerful message with the slogan “We are the 99 percent,” he says that predicting the movement’s trajectory is like shooting “a moving target.”
“[The word] ‘Institutional’ is a contradiction in a social movement,” he says,
“There’s no stasis,” Ganz says. Quoting Bob Dylan, he advises that the activists keep up the pace. “If you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If reelected for a second term on the Cambridge City Council, Leland Cheung says he will be an advocate for government transparency.
“On the council, I have been a loud and passionate voice for government that is transparent and accountable,” Cheung says, citing his initiative to have government contracts available to the public.
On the issue of transparency, Cheung hopes to generate more public participation and dialogue on the renewing of the City Manager’s contract, which will expire next year.
“You’re going to want all hands on deck, with city councilors who have an open, inclusive process for this manager issue,” Cheung says of the contract renewal. “We have to be making sure we have an open and honest process for whatever we do moving forward.”
As a former entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Cheung also places emphasis on job creation in Cambridge. He plans to continue pushing for more business-friendly policies and a reevaluation of old laws that he says hamper business development.
A STUDENT AND AN ENTREPRENEUR
Cheung, currently enrolled at both the Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management, had previously worked at the Department of Energy in Washington, D.C. and Space Adventures, a venture capitalist firm based in Cambridge, before serving his first term on the council. Cheung says that one of the many things that inspired him to initially run was the fact that “there really wasn’t anyone else on the Council representing people that were young professionals, such as those involved in the local tech community, or even students.”
Cheung is the first Asian-American as well as the first student to ever serve on the Cambridge City Council.
AN ADVOCATE FOR TRANSPARENCY
In his push for transparency during his first term, Cheung introduced the “Good Government” rule change. With the change, the council is now required to post any new City Manger’s contract for public viewing 96 hours before they vote on the contract.
Cheung also introduced legislation that led to the creation of BridgeStat, a crime-reduction program modeled after Baltimore’s CitiStat, involving prediction and information of criminal activities to the public. Cheung pushed for BridgeStat to keep the public better informed of how Cambridge police are targeting crime, as well as information on crime data. The program received an award from the International Association of Crime Analysts.
A FRIEND TO BUSINESS
During his first term on the City Council, Cheung was chair of the Economic Development, Training and Employment Committee. He introduced various policies to attract businesses and jobs to Cambridge as well as began initiatives to encourage entrepreneurs in the city, such as Entrepreneur Walk of Fame in Kendall Square.
Cheung also helped lead a joint hearing with the Boston City Council on economic issues, the first joint initiative of its kind between the two cities to develop a partnered strategy in attracting jobs to the area.
ACCESSIBLE AND RESPONSIVE
Supporters note that Cheung is very accessible to his constituents.
“He was always responsive when they needed something done in the neighborhood,” Cambridge resident Elizabeth Manchester says. “He’s doing what constituents actually want him to do ... daily living up to his commitments.”
Manchester also notes Cheung’s policies with public spaces, such as bringing more accessibility and additions such as WiFi to public parks.
In his first two years on council, Cheung passed more legislation than any other previous council member.
“He resets the bar for what a City Council member needs to do,” North Cambridge resident Chris Russkellogg says.
Most of the policy changes that Cheung made in direct response to residents’ concerns were specific, local issues, such as fixing physical problems on certain streets and addressing particular parking issues to encourage more people to patronize area restaurants.
Cheung explains that he did not set out to introduce a higher number of legislative measures than his colleagues.
“I tried to make the most of the opportunity to help as many people as possible, so it just resulted from my drive to respond to the community,” Cheung says.

Larry Ward would like to involve the Harvard community in many of the ideas he hopes implement should he return to the Cambridge City Council after the November election.
“Mr. Ward wants Harvard students to engage with the community, and he is committed to finding different ways to do that,” says Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, who is a member of Ward’s campaign.
Breeanna M. Elliott ’14, who is campaigning for Ward, says that she thinks that Ward is partially motivated to court students more heavily than other candidates because he does not already have a solid campaign base as he is not an incumbent. Ward replaced Vice Mayor Brian P. Murphy ’86-’87 in March of 2009 when Murphy left to work in the office of transportation. Ward finished out the term and lost in the Nov. 2009 election.
For incumbents there isn’t a need to stray from their usual constituency, Elliott says.
“Mr. Ward is trying to reach out to Harvard, MIT, and Wellesley. He is looking to improve and expand the electorate, and not to just maintain it,” she says.
Ward is also looking to engage high school voters.
“People write the younger generation off, they see them as people who won’t vote,” says Ward. “We have registered as many as 70 students down at the high school.”
Ward is active in the Cambridge community, a member of many charitable organizations, working especially with the Cambridge youth. As City Councilor in 2009, Ward founded the Cambridge Ink Recycling Program to recycle ink cartridges from schools and businesses and give the money back to Cambridge youth centers, a program which has raised $8,000 in its first year.
Ward also currently acts as the statewide coordinator for the Massachusetts Coalition for Authentic Reform in Education, an organization aimed at reforming Massachusetts standardized testing and improving the overall quality of public education.
Looking forward, Ward hopes to work with the Harvard members of the Phillips Brooks House Association in order to form new volunteer programs and greater opportunities within Cambridge.
“A significant portion of students are already involved in the community through PBHA programs, and Mr. Ward wants to expand those programs,” says Elliott.
Specifically, Ward plans to improve the Cambridge teen centers with the help of college volunteers. Ward believes that the centers are currently underutilized and no longer satisfy the evolving needs of the teens in Cambridge.
One idea that Ward proposed was to turn a teen center into a recording studio, where youth could go to learn about the different aspects of the growing industry. “We need to feed and lead our young people in to careers,” says Ward.
Additionally, Ward hopes that Harvard students can volunteer in a wide range of areas in the teen centers. Ward envisions students from the Design School working in the Visual Arts Center, while the teens could make great use of Harvard’s Astronomy observatory.
“Ward wants to create avenues for students to become involved,” Solnet says.
As the election approaches, Ward is attending frequent get-togethers to discuss his policies one-on-one with voters, hosted by Cambridge residents committed to the campaign.
At one such gathering, Ward addressed the importance of the composition of the next City Council, as it will most likely have to replace Robert W. Healy Jr.
“This City Council will potentially face the toughest decision it has faced in the past 30 years,” he said. “I will bring a voice of reason to make sure the selection process is authentic, and that we select the person who is best for Cambridge.”
Ward stresses the difference between people and constituents, as he believes it is the City Council’s job to represent everyone in Cambridge, whether or not they are voters.
“Cambridge is a very diverse city in terms of strong opinions. If you elect me, you get someone who will listen,” Ward says.

While many Cambridge City Council candidates note that they have ties with Harvard, Gary W. Mello is likely the only one who has ever lived in the Harvard Sailing Center.
Having sailed since he was in high school, Mello worked at Harvard Sailing from 1968 to 1981 as manager of the newly opened Sailing Center. “I lived in the facility for most of the 1970s,” he says.
Mello, who is 58, currently works as a pharmacy clerk and lives near Central Square. As a daily swimmer, he has benefited from Harvard’s facilities for decades.
“I might be the all-time mileage record-holder in Harvard’s pools,” says Mello. “I was in Blodgett the day it opened [in 1978].”
Mello continues to refer to Malkin Athletic Center as the IAB, or Indoor Athletic Building, the name it went by until it was renovated in 1985.
Mello says he decided to run for City Council because of his alarm at the way the City is spending money. At the present rate of increase, Cambridge will be spending a half-billion dollars each year by 2013, Mello says in a campaign video.
“That’s billion with a B, and it’s way too much,” Mello says.
Mello proposes to cap the City’s annual budget at $450 million and decrease spending through a less costly health insurance policy for city employees. His plan focuses on Cambridge Health Alliance, one of the academic teaching hospitals of the Harvard Medical School which has three campuses at Cambridge Hospital, Somerville Hospital, and Whidden Hospital.
Mello plans to make CHA the baseline insurer for all city employees, thus cutting down on the $55 million that Mello says the city currently spends on private health insurance. Recently, CHA had to shut down clinics and reduce services, but according to Mello, his policy will provide the injection that is needed to stimulate the hospital’s growth. By supporting CHA, it would also create a more attractive health care plan for private employers to adopt, he says.
“Harvard and MIT, the City’s two largest employers, already deal with primary care in house. It’s time we do the same,” says Mello in a promotional video.
But the plan may involve a sacrifice for city employees, such as teachers and local government officials, most of whom currently receive private health insurance.
“I would rather have private insurance so I can have options,” says Regine Guirand, administrative coordinator of orthopedics at Cambridge Hospital. “With private insurance, I can choose who I want to see and don’t have to rely on a doctor’s referral to see other providers like Massachusetts General Hospital.”
As another spending cut, Mello plans to change the timetable of local elections so they coincide with national and state elections.
He anticipates that the 2011 election will be another year of low voter turnout, yet is also a source of extra spending for the City.
Instead, he proposes that 2013 be the last odd year for municipal elections, with ensuing elections held on even years starting 2016. Mello says this change will increase voter participation while saving money for the City.
Regarding the controversy over Cambridge City Manager Robert W. Healy Jr. that has been highlighted in the City Council race, Mello says he is “one of most who wish to see a new City Manager.”
The position of City Manager, which is chosen by the City Council, has been filled by Healy for 30 years. But Mello added that it is “very important that [Healy] be a part of the transition.”
Mello, who is licensed as a real estate broker, also says he advocates more affordable housing in Cambridge. He notes that “the middle class is gone from Cambridge, and it’s not likely to return,” since rent control policies were abolished in the 1990s.
Mello emphasizes that affordable housing does not mean subsidized housing.
In his campaign video, he does not set a concrete proposal for creating more affordable housing, but says, “When the city adopts a plan—overall master plan, city-wide—that is cohesive and fair ... I’ll hop right on board.”
Born and raised in Cambridge, Mello attended Cambridge Latin High School, which has since been folded into Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. He received B.E. and M.E. degrees from Stevens Insitute of Technology, and is the father of two children, Andrew and Ian, who are third and eighth graders in the Cambridge public school system.
He still maintains an interest in the sailing team’s performance, and often stops by to talk with the staff. Bern Noack, assistant coach for Harvard sailing, says he has known Mello for at least five years.
“I think he cares about Cambridge a lot. He’s a long, long time Cambridge resident,” Noack says.

UPDATE: 4:09 a.m. November 3, 2011
Harvard has extended its deadline for students applying to the College under its early action admissions option in response to the severe snowstorm that struck the Northeast this past weekend.
Applicants affected by the storm—which left millions of residents of the region between New Jersey and Massachusetts without electricity—will now be able to submit applications until midnight on Nov. 4, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid announced Tuesday in a statement on its website.
The Common Application website, which the majority of Harvard applicants use to submit their application materials, has remained open for counselors and teachers to submit recommendations for their students. The website asks students with deadline issues to contact individual institutions.
“We knew from past experience that this would be a concern and we were aware that other institutions had also extended their deadlines,” said Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal in an email.
Neal added that the extension was common practice.
“We have, on occasion, extended deadlines in the past as a result of extenuating circumstances,” Neal said. “This extension is not at all unprecedented.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 could not be reached for comment.
Other Ivy League universities also extended their deadlines for early admission in response to the storm. Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania also asked applicants to submit applications by Nov. 4. Yale and Dartmouth extended their deadlines to Nov. 2 and Nov. 7, respectively.
Amy Sack, president of an admissions consulting firm based in Conn., said that her students’ application experiences were relatively unaffected by the storm as she had counseled them to submit their applications a week before the deadline.
“It wasn’t a problem. All of my students submitted over a week ago,” she said. “I always tell them, ‘You never know what’s going to happen.’”
Still, Sack said, some of her students decided to submit additional applications after hearing of deadline extensions.
Harvard’s early action admissions program—which returned this year after a five-year hiatus—gives students the option to apply to the College by Nov. 1 and receive a nonbinding decision in December.

UPDATE: 4:04 a.m. November 3, 2011
Nearly 70 Harvard student protesters walked out of Economics 10 on Wednesday afternoon, expressing dissatisfaction with what they perceive to be an overly conservative bias in the course.
The walkout was meant to be a show of support for the “Occupy” movement’s principal criticism that conservative economic policies have increased income inequality in the United States.
“Today, we are walking out of your class, Economics 10, in order to express our discontent with the bias inherent in this introductory economics course. We are deeply concerned about the way that this bias affects students, the University, and our greater society,” read a statement issued by the organizers.
Economics 10—more commonly referred to as “Ec 10”—is taught by professor N. Gregory Mankiw, and has the highest enrollment of any course at the College, boasting over 700 enrollees.
Mankiw, who was aware that student would be staging the walkout, began lecture by announcing his office hours.
“I was going to announce this at the end, but I have a feeling people might leave a little early,” he said.
At 12:15 p.m. students stood up en masse and walked out of Sanders Theatre, where Ec 10 lectures are held. Some students carried signs, but most left carrying just their backpacks. As the demonstrators marched out of Sanders Theatre, a small crowd booed them in support of Mankiw. Most students remained in their seats
After walking out, the group gathered in the hallway outside of the theater, standing in a circle and speaking out about the event.
“Harvard graduates have been complicit [and] have aided many of the worst injustices of recent years. Today we fight that history,” said Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, one of the students who organized the walkout. “Harvard students will not do that anymore. We will use our education for good, and not for personal gain at the expense of millions.”
Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, another organizer of the walk out, said that he believes the course is emblematic of the economic policies that have led the financial crisis.
“Ec 10 is a symbol of the larger economic ideology that created the 2008 collapse. Professor Mankiw worked in the Bush administration, and he clearly has a conservative ideology,” Bayard said. “His conservative views are the kind that created the collapse of 2008. This easy money focus on enriching the wealthiest Americans—he really operates with that ideology.”
Mankiw served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the second Bush Administration and is currently an adviser to former Mass. Governor Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. Mankiw declined to comment for this article.
Sandalow-Ash ’15 said that the course too heavily asserts conservative economic claims as fact.
“It’s a class that’s very indoctrinating, and does not encourage diversity of views. Economic questions are not always clear-cut. Multiple views should be presented in this course,” Sandalow-Ash said.
Many undergraduates remained skeptical of the demonstration’s  mission.
Mark S. Krass ’14 said he believes the walkout’s intended goals were unclear, which detracted from the walkout’s message and comprises its integrity.
“Those of us who are supportive of Occupy Wall Street are trying very hard to combat the view that there is no set of objectives or ideology motivating that movement,” Krass said. “It was really distressing for people to advertise a walkout of Ec 10 on the basis of high textbook prices and bad teaching.”
Jeremy Patashnik ’12, an economics concentrator who authored a lengthy piece in defense of the course for the Harvard Political Review, rejected the notion that Ec 10 carries a conservative bias.
“I self-identify as a liberal on these issues, and I don’t see the conservative bias. I think this walkout misses the point of what Ec 10 is supposed to be,” Patashnik said. “This class is not attempting to give normative answers about how to address social issues. It’s meant to introduce students to economics as a social science.”
Krass noted that the topic of Wednesday’s lecture—income inequality—might have been particularly interesting to those who participated in the walkout.
“It’s incredible that in the name of advancing a more liberal view of economics they chose to walk out of a class on a social issue they care about,” Krass said.
According to those who walked out, part of the discontent with Economics 10 stems from what they say is the limited number of opportunities to express skepticism toward the material taught in the course.
“I’ve definitely written question marks in my textbook, but we never really get to question [what he says] in section,” said Alexandra E. Foote ’15, who is currently enrolled in the course. “I don’t know very much about economics, and it’s not really fair that I’m getting a skewed perspective.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I can sum up the reasoning behind my decision to make the women’s hockey team the first beat I claimed with one word: winning.
By that I mean both that the beat has thus far proved to be extremely enjoyable and highly rewarding and that my draft choice was highly influenced by my desire to write more stories about wins than losses.
Sure, the friendliness of the players helped, and the sport had always intrigued me. (Perhaps if I had seen Mighty Ducks before Space Jam, I might have grown up on the ice instead of the basketball court.)
But I know that when I was picking up extra stories in the weeks leading up to the beat draft—the process by which writers select which teams to cover in order of story count—I was writing so I could cover a winning team.
See, there’s always reason for optimism in Bright Hockey Center; it’s just a matter of degree.
And there’s reason to believe that I could be quite a happy beat writer this winter.
Entering the 2011-12 season that kicked off last weekend, my co-writers and I all thought this team had a lot of potential; the talent level alone told us that.
The team returned arguably its top two players from a year ago: juniors Jillian Dempsey and Josephine Pucci. The current sophomore class showed plenty of potential during its rookie season, and the incoming freshmen seemed promising.
But it took last year’s squad, which was not as young as this year’s group, a little while to find its groove. Harvard sank to the bottom of the nation in penalty kill and posted a 5-6-1 record in its pre-Christmas slate.
It wasn’t necessarily that the Crimson was playing badly. Its fire and fight were still evident by the fact that it often outshot its opponents—another hallmark of coach Katey Stone’s teams. But it took the team a couple of months to learn how to turn outshooting into outscoring.
So it seemed reasonable to think that this year’s squad might similarly need a little bit of time to accustom itself to the speed and intensity of the ECAC.
That’s not to say I didn’t think the team could have a good season. I just figured there was no reason for the team to be discouraged if it didn’t excel in its first few weekends on the ice.
But when I went to Harvard’s exhibition game against McGill two weekends ago, I saw a team that was ready to play. While the Crimson’s aggression was again impressive—Harvard outshot the Martlets in the first and second periods—what was more encouraging was the Crimson’s execution on offense, particularly in the third period. Harvard and McGill each took seven shots in the frame, but the Crimson scored twice while the Martlets went scoreless. And while Stone commented that the team had to rely on its penalty kill more than it would have liked—Harvard committed a whopping 12 penalties—she had to have been encouraged by the fact that the Crimson only allowed a goal on one of them. Given the youth of the defense, this bodes well for the season.
Still, it was only an exhibition game—even if it was a 3-1 win against the defending Canadian national champions.
But Harvard continued its strong play this past weekend with a 7-1 victory over St. Lawrence on Friday and a 2-1 victory over Clarkson on Saturday. Neither of these opponents are tops in the ECAC, but the Crimson didn’t figure out how to dominate the Saints like that until the end of last season. In both of last season’s regular season matchups, Harvard took one-goal victories over St. Lawrence and needed overtime to do it the second time. When the Crimson crushed the Saints in the first round of the ECAC playoffs with two five-goal victories, it marked the culmination of a season of improvement. The fact that Harvard just beat St. Lawrence by an even larger margin signals that the team is picking off right where it left off.
The Crimson will face an early test in two weeks when it faces against No. 3 Cornell without the help of Stone, Pucci, Dempsey, and freshman Michelle Picard, who will all be in Nykoping, Sweden with the U.S. National Team for the Four Nations Cup. Their absence will leave the spotlight on players like sophomore defenseman Marissa Gedman, who scored the game-winning goal against the Golden Knights and had a goal and two assists the night before against the Saints.
I’m not saying I expect Harvard to win, but the Crimson’s younger players seem to be as prepared for the game as one could expect them to be.
Harvard is still very untested, and time will tell how the team responds to the nation’s best teams. But for now, concerns about the Crimson’s youth seem to be unmerited.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He won an NCAA Championship at 157 pounds. He garnered a 132-16 record over his four years in a Harvard singlet. He never dropped a single bout in his senior year en route to a 35-0 record. He has arguably had the most successful career as a Harvard wrestler. And now he’s back for more.
This time, J.P. O’Connor ’10 has returned to the Harvard wrestling program as an assistant coach. But before O’Connor made the decision to return to the squad in this new role, he had to undergo a difficult path, one that was both unfamiliar to him in certain ways given his recent success at the collegiate level and familiar to him because of the dedication to wrestling he had to put in to achieve the level of success he has today.
When O’Connor graduated from Harvard in May 2010, he was originally planning to apply to medical school and eventually become a doctor. But his focus for the immediate future started to shift back toward accomplishing even more in wrestling and O’Connor decided to trade in his scrubs for a singlet to train for a spot on the 2012 U.S. Olympic team.
Although O’Connor was accustomed to being at the top of the pack, he now found himself in a position in which he had to work his way up the ranks of the U.S. freestyle circuit.
“It’s been fun because it’s been very challenging,” O’Connor said. “Just like there is a gap to be bridged between high school and college, there is a gap to be bridged between college and senior-level freestyle stuff.”
One of the toughest challenges for O’Connor has been getting used to the new rules and format of international freestyle wrestling that differ from collegiate wrestling. But like in his career at Harvard, the Oxford, N.Y. native has only worked harder in the face of these challenges, watching hours of video to improve and learning key aspects about each one of his opponents’ styles.
While O’Connor has had success in his pursuit, he has also had his share of setbacks. At the U.S. Open in April, he suffered a right knee injury and tear in his ACL, as well as bone bruising. Before he could fully recover, O’Connor decided to compete in the World Team Trials. O’Connor lost in three periods against Kyle Dake, a Cornell junior with two NCAA championships to his name, one at 141 lbs in 2010 and his second at 149 lbs. in 2011.
“I think last year, it took me a little while to make the transition and have some success with it,” O’Connor said. “I did have success and it was a good year, but going from being 35-0 and winning a national title to not winning every tournament I enter, it was definitely humbling, but more than that, it’s a new challenge.”
With spare time on his hands in his quest toward qualifying for a spot on the 2012 U.S. Olympic team, O’Connor was looking for a way to better spend his time. When a former Harvard assistant coach decided to take a position at Boston University, the opportunity opened for O’Connor to fill the role.
The new position as assistant coach allowed O’Connor to focus on his training while helping the Harvard wrestling team to improve, the same way that others had helped him to work toward his goals while on the team, and travel with the squad when he was not training. For O’Connor, one of the defining aspects of the Harvard wrestling program was the focus on the values of hard work, character, and family.
“Anytime we can bring someone like J.P. onto our staff makes it that much better,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “He knows what Harvard is about and the program.”
Just as Jesse Jantzen ’04, an NCAA Champion himself, was an inspiration to O’Connor when he was moving up the ranks in college, O’Connor has proven to be an inspiration for the current members of the wrestling team.
“I would say that J.P. is the Jesse Jantzen of the current Harvard wrestling team,” junior Steven Keith said. “Overall, he’s a phenomenal person and leads by example … He cares a lot about wrestling and each of us as people and is willing to do everything in his power to make us the best wrestlers we can be.”
The former NCAA Champion is still not sure what the future holds, but his mix of passion, hard work, and determination in his past has served him well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the announcer counted down the final seconds of Tuesday night’s men’s soccer match at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, Harvard sophomore defender Ross Friedman stayed patient. Taking advantage of the situation’s urgency, Friedman faked a shot before taking one more touch on the side of the penalty box and driving the ball across the pitch in front of Colgate’s goal, hoping for a deflection.
His hopes came to fruition as sophomore forward Connor McCarthy redirected the ball towards the net, where the Raiders’ goalie was unable to completely stop its trajectory.
After a brief moment of absolute silence during which it was unclear if a goal was scored, the Harvard sideline erupted.
With four seconds remaining, the game was tied at three. The tally would not change during two scoreless periods before both sides walked off the pitch with a 3-3 draw.
“It’s good to get a tie after what we’ve been through the last few games of just losing,” Friedman said. “But for us a tie is not good enough.”
The Crimson (2-10-3, 0-4-1 Ivy) would have had a better chance at a more favorable result had it not been for defensive errors early in the game.
Colgate (10-4-4, 4-1-1 Patriot) took an early lead in the fifteenth minute thanks to a cross from the midfield that bounced over the outreached foot of a Harvard defender and found Raiders senior forward Steven Miller, who finished the play by putting a shot past the Crimson’s goalie inside the far post.
Fifteen minutes later, Miller put Colgate up by two when he finished a cross from the corner.
“Unfortunately we didn’t come out like we should have,” Friedman said. “Mental mistakes ... from several people—that’s the type of stuff that can cost you a game. That’s something we’ve been struggling with all season.”
Ten minutes later, Harvard posted an answer when freshman midfielder Tim Schmoll took a pass from co-captain Tim Linden and fired it just under the crossbar, cutting the deficit to one. The Crimson continued to control play in the final minutes of the first half but was unable to find an equalizing goal.
Coming out of the break, Harvard continued applying pressure, but miscommunication and errant passes kept the squad from tying the match. In the 58th minute, the Raiders took a second two-goal lead as Miller completed his hat trick on a header that resulted from a defensive error.
“Some really poor mistakes led to goals,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “We quite literally gifted them three goals. There were two missed clearances and one pass directly to them. We have to take credit for not handling our business defensively.”
With just over ten minutes remaining in the match, Harvard made a game of it when Friedman drove a free kick into the box. Senior Jamie Rees handled the rest, deflecting the ball into the back of the net and giving the Crimson life.
With the scoreboard now reflecting only a one goal difference, the whole Harvard bench stood on the sideline and cheered for the rest of the match.
“That’s when we started believing,” Friedman said. “The attitude on the field really changed. We were not losing that game. That’s the attitude we had.”
Rees’s goal set the stage for the wild scene in the match’s final minutes, culminating in McCarthy’s game-tying tally.
“Ross put a great ball in the box, I was able to get something on it, and it just got across the line,” McCarthy said of his goal. “I saw it trickling and bouncing across. There was a split-second where I was really nervous that he wasn’t going to call it [a goal].”
The equalizer was McCarthy’s first goal of the year.
Overtime offered significantly less excitement with each team mustering only two shots in the twenty minute golden-goal period.
On the day, Colgate took 15 shots compared to the Crimson’s 14. Nine of the Raiders’ attempts were on target, while only five Harvard shots were on goal.
Crimson senior goalkeeper Austin Harms recorded six saves for the match, pushing him to fifth in Harvard history with 182 career stops.
The final score was the second tie in four days for the Crimson men’s soccer team. In a snowstorm on Saturday, Harvard battled Dartmouth to a 1-1 final.
“That was one of the more unusual games I’ve been a part of,” Junot said. “In the midst of a season like ours, it showed incredible character by our team to fight back into the game. It’s disappointing that it’s this late in the season and there’s not a lot left in the season, but we’re building a base for performance.”
