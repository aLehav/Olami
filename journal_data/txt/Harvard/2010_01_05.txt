After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts State Senator Anthony D. Galluccio, who has attributed failed breathalyzer tests to his toothpaste, was sentenced Monday to one year in jail for violating his probation in a hit-and-run accident.
After a day of testimony, Cambridge District Court Judge Matthew J. Nestor said he was convinced that Galluccio had been drinking when he tested positive for alcohol on Dec. 21. Galluccio, who was led from the court in handcuffs, will serve his term in the Middlesex House of Correction, the Boston Globe reported.
Galluccio, who pleaded guilty last month to leaving the scene of an October accident that caused minor injuries to two individuals, was ordered to abstain from alcohol and to submit to alcohol testing as part of his probation. But he failed a series of breathalyzer tests just three days after his guilty plea.
Galluccio testified on Monday that he had showered and brushed his teeth twice before the tests, stating that he had not ingested alcohol that morning, according to the Globe. Galluccio has publicly attributed the results of the tests to his use of two brands of toothpaste—Colgate Total Whitening and Sensodyne—that contain sorbitol, a sugar alcohol.
"I had no idea what caused that reading,'' Galluccio testified. "All I know is that I had not ingested alcohol.''
Senate President Therese Murray—who had earlier forced Galluccio to resign as chair of the Higher Education Committee and a member of six other committees, according to the Globe—did not publicly ask Galluccio to resign from the Senate in light of Monday’s sentence. In a short statement, Murray said the Senate will discuss its response to the situation when it meets on Wednesday.
Galluccio, who has represented Cambridge and several neighboring towns in the Massachusetts Senate since 2007, has been convicted of driving under the influence twice before, according to the Globe, but refused to state whether he had been drinking before the October hit-and-run incident.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Globe has named Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren its 2009 Bostonian of the  Year for bringing “a sense of sanity to the economic crisis” as  the official overseer of the U.S. bank bailout program.
As chair of the Congressional  Oversight Panel, Warren has grilled Treasury officials and sought  to defend the middle class while keeping a watchful eye on the government's Troubled  Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was created in October 2008 to stave  off a potential collapse of the U.S. financial system.
Warren wrote in an e-mailed  statement to The Crimson that she has been less than impressed by the  results of TARP so far. She wrote that while TARP successfully calmed  the panic on Wall Street, problems affecting the rest of the country such as foreclosures  and constricted small business lending have “intensified.”
“Banks that were too big  to fail a year and a half ago are now bigger,” Warren wrote. “Treasury  was very effective at shoveling money into big banks, but it was not  so effective at meeting the other goals Congress established for the  program.”
Warren has advocated for the middle  class in Huffington Post columns and several books, including the 2000  release "The Fragile Middle Class: Americans in Debt."
Warren has argued for the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which would regulate financial products like mortgages and credit cards to improve transparency and customers' understanding of their terms and conditions. She has envisioned the creation of an agency overseeing such financial products "for a long time," according to Law School Professor Charles Fried.
President Barack Obama has voiced his support for the plan, and a bill that would create  such an agency is currently moving through Congress.
The Boston Globe article describes  Warren as "a burr under the saddle of official Washington." In public statements,  Warren has faulted the government—and the Treasury in particular—for  funneling money into Wall Street as the middle class faces further constraints.
She has minced few words when questioning Treasury Secretary Timothy  F. Geithner at quarterly hearings before the Congressional Oversight  Panel.
“The Treasury has now announced  three plans and clearly has not gotten the job done," she told Geithner at a hearing last month. "What’s going to be different  now, Mr. Secretary?”
In a taped interview with the Globe, Warren reserved her  harshest criticism for the bankers who have  been fighting “tooth and nail” against regulatory reform.
“So-called experts led us  into this problem and helped craft bailouts that were very helpful to  themselves. Now they want to dominate regulatory reform,” she wrote  in an e-mail to The Crimson. “I think that’s wrong.”
Several of Warren's colleagues  said that her recognition as Bostonian of the Year is well deserved.
"As head of the TARP oversight  panel, Elizabeth Warren has been an extremely effective and influential  monitor of one of the consequential economic programs in history, and  in this role she has successfully and effectively put a spotlight on  issues of great significance," said Law School Professor Lucian A. Bebchuk,  who has written prolifically about TARP and executive pay, in an e-mailed  statement from abroad.
“It’s the culmination of  work she’s been doing for many years,” Fried  said of Warren's performance in Washington. “She has been a champion  of the financial situation of mainly families and middle-class families,  so it is very natural that she is continuing that work now in Washington.”
Warren—an Oklahoma native  and formerly a registered Republican—was not always a champion of  the middle class, according to the Globe. But after years of  study as a bankruptcy law scholar, she came to the conclusion that many  families who file for bankruptcy or foreclose on their homes are not primarily at fault for the situations in which they find themselves.
Representatives at the Boston Globe could not  be reached for comment on Tuesday.
Despite the roadblocks that she has faced in Washington, Warren wrote to The Crimson that she continues to believe in an improved regulatory landscape.
“There’s no question that the banks have a lot of power, but I think David might beat Goliath this time," she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts State Senator Anthony D. Galluccio resigned his Senate seat Tuesday night after being sentenced on Monday to a year in jail for violating his probation for an October hit-and-run accident.
“My decision today is not out of hopelessness but rather one of hope and opportunity,” Galluccio wrote in a letter today to Senate President Therese Murray. "In the end, I make this decision out of admiration and respect for each and every one of my Senate colleagues.”
In his resignation letter, Galluccio—who is currently imprisoned in the Middlesex House of Correction—asked for the support of his fellow senators as he attempts to appeal Monday's sentence. The senator has publicly attributed the positive results of a series of breathalyzer tests to his toothpaste, and he continues to assert that he did not consume alcohol—despite Cambridge District Court Judge Matthew J. Nestor’s ruling to the contrary.
“I maintain my innocence regarding this violation,” Galluccio wrote in his letter. “I assure you I have kept faith with the court, the Senate, my family and myself with my decision in early October to eliminate alcohol from my life.”
Galluccio, who pleaded guilty last month to leaving the scene of an October accident in Cambridge that caused minor injuries to two individuals, was ordered to abstain from alcohol and to submit to alcohol testing as part of his probation. But he tested positive for alcohol just three days after his guilty plea.
Galluccio testified on Monday that he had showered and brushed his teeth twice before the tests, stating that he had not ingested alcohol that morning, according to the Globe.
Murray had announced Monday that the Senate would discuss its response to Galluccio’s sentencing when it meets Wednesday. According to the Boston Globe, the Senate can recommend that a member be censured, suspended, or expelled—had the last motion been taken, Galluccio would have been the first senator to be expelled since 1977.
"Senator Galluccio has made the right decision today for himself, his family, the Senate and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts," Murray said in a statement released Tuesday. "With his resignation, he can begin to face difficult personal challenges, and I hope he receives the services he needs to help him along the way."
Galluccio, who has represented Cambridge and several neighboring towns in the Massachusetts Senate since 2007, has been convicted of driving under the influence twice before, according to the Globe, but refused to state whether he had been drinking before the October hit-and-run incident.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SANTA CLARA, Calif.—While some might call it a disappointment, it could just be a sign of things to come. On an evening when the main event was meant to be the homecoming of superstar Jeremy Lin, it was a freshman who stole the spotlight.
Rookie Kyle Casey had a career-high 27 points to go along with a game-high eight rebounds, leading Harvard (11-3) to a 74-66 victory over Santa Clara (8-9) at the Leavey Center Monday night.
The win bolstered the Crimson's record non-conference performance this season, not to mention extended the team’s winning streak to four games.
"We're very proud of the effort these kids have given," Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. "The foundation for our program is going to be how we guard on the defensive end. I was very pleased with our kids and their ability to do that."
The newly-named Ivy League Rookie of the Week, Casey has been no stranger to rewriting history himself, as the strong showing marked his third-straight game with a career high in scoring.
The versatile forward went a perfect six-of-six from the floor, including a pair of three-pointers and a thunderous fast-break dunk. He did even more damage from the foul line, where Casey knocked down 13 free throws.
"He made shots, and he played harder than our guys did to get himself to the free throw line 16 times," Santa Clara coach Kerry Keating said. "He's a good player, and talented, and I would expect there's going to be a lot more nights like that."
Fellow freshmen Christian Webster and Dee Giger were the Crimson’s only other double-digit scorers, adding 15 and 10 points, respectively.
Lin was no slouch, despite collecting only six points on a relatively quiet offensive night. Faced with a defense focused on keeping him from scoring, the co-captain directed his efforts towards creating chances for teammates. Lin totaled a season-high nine assists, many coming off dribble drive penetration.
"That's what a good player does, especially when he realizes there's a game plan to take away his scoring," Keating said. "When your senior can score six points in a road game, and still win, then obviously he's a lot more than just your leading scorer."
Lin did, however, make at least one play worthy of the highlight reel, setting off his cheering fans—the game’s total attendance was 4700, the largest the building’s ever seen for a non-conference contest—with just over five minutes to play.
Holding the ball on the left wing, Lin teased his defender with a jab step, drove left, and elevated against multiple defenders. He would convert the layup, giving his team a 63-46 lead.
Not as spectacular, yet just as important, was Lin’s play on the other end of the floor in response to a 14-2 Santa Clara run.
With the Harvard lead down to seven and under two minutes to play, Lin set his feet and drew a charge from Bronco guard Robert Smith, who had beaten his counterpart to the hoop earlier in the second half. The offensive foul silenced a raucous home crowd, and the Crimson would close out the win at the free throw line.
Harvard's final victory before its Ivy opener Saturday against Dartmouth did not come easily, as the Crimson struggled to put away a resilient Santa Clara squad that refused to fold in the second half.
After taking a six-point lead into halftime, Harvard was unable to extend the advantage into double-digits until just under the ten-minute mark, when Giger hit a triple off a kick-out from Lin.
The Crimson lead would reach 19 with just over five minutes left, but the Broncos quickly fought back, setting the stage for Lin to take the key charge.
As has been a problem for Harvard all year, turnovers plagued the visiting offense. Lin ended up with four, and seven others had at least two, for a total of 20 giveaways—which led to 15 points for the opposition in the second half alone.
The Broncos also found success with their big men inside, holding a 30-24 advantage in interior scoring. The Crimson had been outscored in the paint only two times previously this season.
In particular, Santa Clara accomplished one of its team goals, limiting sophomore Keith Wright to only three points, while senior Pat Magnarelli played only four minutes off the bench. Fortunately for Harvard, Casey stepped up in a big way, as did the Crimson defense, to close out the non-conference schedule with another strong win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SANTA CLARA, Calif.—Even for a first-time visitor to the Leavey Center, it was clear that the crowd for last night’s contest between Harvard and Santa Clara was atypical. As 4700 spectators packed the arena—a record for a non-conference game that tied last season’s attendance against Gonzaga—more than half represented the Crimson, or at least its Palo Alto star Jeremy Lin.
With a full Broncos student section heckling the heralded co-captain and thousands wielding signs and t-shirts of support, Lin sparked a unique atmosphere in his homecoming game, a 74-66 victory for Harvard.
“We’ve played in a lot of different places and seen some pretty good crowds, some pretty intense crowds,” freshman Kyle Casey said. “But this crowd was great. Santa Clara was on us and our fans were with us, so [there] was great energy out there.”
It became clear even before tipoff that this road contest would be unusual for the Crimson, as Lin’s announcement in the starting lineup brought thunderous applause from the spectators. Even though the senior guard had represented Harvard in the Bay Area once before—during a disastrous Stanford tournament two seasons ago—Lin noted the challenge of facing so much scrutiny, particularly given his status as the face of the Crimson program.
“I tried to stay a little more relaxed [than against Stanford], and it wasn’t very easy,” he said. “I’ve never really had a game with more support than this game in my entire life. That made me real nervous.”
Adding to the intensity was the ongoing cultural interest that Lin has garnered as an Asian-American. Considering the vastly diverse attendance and the number of T-shirts reading “The Jeremy Lin Experience,” it appeared that Lin singlehandedly altered the Bronco basketball experience. While the Taiwanese standout tried to keep his focus on the court, Lin’s teammates ensured that the star took note of the crowd’s heavily-skewed demographic.
“I wasn’t really paying attention to [the number of Asian supporters], but when I went into the locker room my teammates told me it looked like Hong Kong,” Lin deadpanned.
But joking aside, the senior voiced tremendous appreciation for his growing fan base.
“A lot of people go out of their way to be really, really supportive,” he said. “It’s people that I’ve never met before and people that I’ve known. I’m very thankful for it all, very flattered and overwhelmed.”
BOYS TO MEN
Lin faced heightened attention not only from thousands of spectators but also from the five opponents on the floor. Santa Clara emphasized collapsing on the guard as he drove to the basket, effectively limiting his night as a scorer.
But Lin simply consented to take a back seat, making up for a meager six points by dishing out nine assists—most of which found Harvard’s trio of up-and-coming rookies, Christian Webster, Dee Giger, and Casey.
The three freshmen proved to be the only scorers in double digits for the Crimson, accounting for over 70% of Harvard’s points. Casey led the pack with a career-high 27 on a perfect 6-of-6 shooting, while Webster netted 15 and Giger 10. The group also showed its versatility, driving to the hoop to draw fouls and demonstrating range. The trio went 19-of-24 from the free-throw line and hit all five of its three-pointers, but Lin noted that the group’s intangibles were equally valuable.
“The last two classes have been the most talented recruiting classes we’ve seen, ever,” Lin said. “And they’ve been really humble. They’re eager to learn and they don’t think they know it all…They respect the coaches and just come ready to play every day.”
Casey certainly appeared ready to contribute against the Broncos, jumpstarting the Crimson offense with 13 first-half points. The rookie’s effort marked a third-consecutive career high, as Casey backed up his Ivy League Rookie of the Week honor from last week with a game-changing performance.
“Certainly, you can see what [Casey] can do on the offensive end,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s an inside-out player. You can see what he brings to the program.”
Yet as Amaker praised the freshman’s talent, Casey deflected credit, emphasizing the benefits of hard work on the court.
“I think I’ve been playing with a lot more energy, being out there and being active,” he said. “I’ve just been in the right place at the right time, and knocking down shots.”
So too have his classmates, and Harvard continues to reap the benefits.

According to Don Lattin’s The Harvard  Psychedelic Club (HarperCollins, $24.99), which goes on sale today,  there was apparently a time at Harvard when it was perfectly hunky-dory  for professors to give LSD to their students—for purely scientific  purposes, of course.
Needless to say, Harvard is a much different place  these days, when the only things our professors give us are lower participation grades and holier-than-thou frowns when our cell  phones go off in class. Sigh.
But back in the 1960s—when guys seemed averse to razors and grooming, girls were  banished to Radcliffe Yard, and students of both genders stormed  into University Hall to protest whatever they felt like protesting—the Harvard Psilocybin  Project was in full swing [see correction below]. The project, which involved administering psilocybin (a consciousness-expanding drug) to research subjects, brought together Timothy Leary, Huston Smith, Richard Alpert (aka Ram Dass),  and former Crimson editor Andrew T. Weil ’63, four men who became major players in the counterculture movement and, as Lattin claims, "killed the fifities and ushered in a new age for America.”
But the often forgotten presence  of Harvard in this wild and crazy chapter of American history is really something. According to a review in the San  Francisco Chronicle, Lattin’s book indicates that then-University President Nathan M. Pusey's '28 decision to fire Alpert and Leary essentially mandated that San Francisco (where the pair headed after leaving dainty old Cambridge) would be the holy seat of counterculture.
The review also speculates that it was Weil's reporting that first brought Pusey's attention to the Harvard Psilocybin Project. If that's true, then it looks like it was the work of a Crimson reporter (who oddly embraced drugs and, as we mentioned, later joined the ranks of the counterculture) was the reason all that epic, tie-dyed craziness of the 1960s didn't take place right here in Harvard Yard.
A previous version of this post suggested that the storming of University Hall occurred in the early 1960s. In fact, the protest took place in 1969.
