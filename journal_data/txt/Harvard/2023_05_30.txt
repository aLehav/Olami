Despite being a relatively new musical, there have been many productions of “The Prom” since its first performance in 2016, including a film adaptation. Directed by Paul Daigneault, SpeakEasy Stage Company’s recent production of “The Prom” is more intimate and — despite some hiccups — an emotionally-charged musical worth seeing.
“The Prom” follows the story of Emma (Liesie Kelly), a high school student in Indiana who sparks controversy when she announces her intention to bring her girlfriend to prom. Drawn to the news by their desire to do good (or rather, their desire to be publicly seen doing good), four Broadway has-beens, Dee Dee (Mary Callanan), Barry (Johnny Kuntz), Trent (Jared Troilo) and Angie (Lisa Yuen), arrive in Emma’s town to demand justice and equality.
Throughout the musical, the stage transforms into several settings, including a bedroom, a high school hallway, and an Applebee’s. The scenic design is understandably light on set pieces, which works more effectively in some scenes than others. For example, the simplicity makes the opening number, “Changing Lives,” feel underwhelming in comparison to the glitz and glamor alluded to in the book and the expressive lyrics.
On the other hand, the cozy staging in “Unruly Heart” works to compliment the deeply personal message of Emma’s struggle to be accepted and to accept herself. More energetic numbers such as “It’s Not About Me” suffer from the sparse set design. For example, in a dramatic scene where Dee Dee boisterously swoops into the unsuspecting Indiana town of Edgewater, the understated set causes the moment to fall flat.
Nevertheless, the musical’s humor consistently shines. Perhaps one of the most hilarious numbers was “The Acceptance Song,” led by the well-meaning yet bumbling Trent, who attempts a dazzling musical number to promote acceptance among the bigoted Indiana population. The over-enthusiastic singing from the four Broadway actors, interspersed with the less-than-enthusiastic response from their audience, made for a delightful contrast. In the plot, the performance represents the silly halftime show of a monster truck rally, which further adds to the humor of the scene.
The musical is strongest when it embraces its own absurdity and larger-than-life characters. The interactions between Barry and Emma are particularly sweet as Barry’s enthusiasm coaxes Emma out of her shell. “Tonight Belongs To You,” a song in which Barry helps Emma prepare for the prom, is charming because of its palpable excitement; equally charming are their heart-to-heart conversations.
The romance between Alyssa (Abriel Coleman) and Emma is not as compelling as it could have been. Though perhaps not the fault of this particular production but rather the musical’s book, the character of Alyssa feels underdeveloped and the tensions with her mother are neither as evident nor as emotional as they could have been. Though Alyssa has her own song (“Alyssa Greene”) to express the pressures she feels in fulfilling her mother’s expectations to be intelligent, beautiful, and straight, her character development up to this point does not make the song as emotionally impactful as it could have been.
However, the youthful energy of SpeakEasy Stage Company’s cast was on full display. The ensemble, composed of young people playing characters in Emma and Alyssa’s high school, were dynamic and exciting to watch, particularly during the musical numbers. In particular, the choreography was invigorating; “You Happened” and “It’s Time To Dance” featured dance breaks emanating with joy.
Ultimately, “The Prom” is an emotional musical that, at its core, celebrates accepting oneself and embracing others — a timeless message that still rings true. Though SpeakEasy Stage Company’s production may have a few flaws, it still promises a fun night out at the theater and an uplifting story that is well worth a watch.

The first thing that you notice when walking into Central Square Theater’s production of “Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, Part I: Millennium Approaches,” directed by Eric Tucker, is the ethereal emptiness. The theater is transformed into a stark space filled with white fluorescent light, which never dims. Instead, actors walk onstage and casually begin talking, as if the stage is the sidewalk and the audience has just stopped by. In Central Square’s staging, the movers and shakers of these characters’ worlds are not unseen heavenly forces, religious doctrine, or even angels: They are each other.
Set in New York City between 1985 and 1986, “Angels in America Part I: Millennium Approaches” is the first of a two-part epic by Tony Kushner that follows Prior Walter, a gay man with AIDS; Louis Ironson, his boyfriend; Roy Cohn, a gay and closeted, uber-conservative, Republican lawyer; Joe Pitt, a gay and closeted, Mormon, Republican clerk; and Harper, Joe’s wife. The play explores how these characters’ lives intertwine and untangle, and how, despite ideological and identity differences, they are ultimately inseparable from each other.
The characters’ messy connections are highlighted by evocative staging and props by Scenic Designer Deb Sivigny and Props Artisan Karissa Roberts. In the second scene of the play, Roy Cohn is seemingly in control, juggling multiple phones, with the whole city on speed dial. However, skillful prop and set design choices reveal a deeper element to his character. Cohn sits on a wheely office chair, giddily spinning out to actors with phones for him to grab. The phone cords, spooling out like octopus arms, suggest a symbiosis — a messy dependency on the people he despises for being gay, progressive, and lower class. Throughout the play, these relationships are reinforced through the usage of these phones.
The production also utilizes atypical aesthetics in a way that’s ironic, tongue-in-cheek, and current. Belize, a Black “ex-ex drag queen,” enters wearing leopard-print chaps, and his outfits just get more fun from there. Louis Ironson, a gay Jewish man with a penchant for going on political tangents, is exactly the kind of Castro, white, liberal gay that’s just annoying enough to put up with — emphasized by his preppy cuffed jeans and sneakers. Harper, a straight, Mormon housewife and Valium addict who comes to realize that her husband is queer, is dressed in jewel-toned overalls and Converse sneakers, which makes her look more like a young, naive college student than a harried housewife. These costuming choices by Daniele Tyler Mathews create a diverse ensemble cast that play into and against type.
The production also examines how queer beauty is inseparable from tragedy. In one scene, Prior, who has been recently diagnosed with AIDS, is alone at home, getting into drag to cope. He hopes to negate sickness with beauty, undesirability with desirability. However, instead of transforming his face through makeup or festooning himself with glamorous clothing, Prior fashions a makeshift dress from the same white shroud that served, in various parts of the play, as a burial shroud. It could be an allusion to Lady Liberty, or it could be just a dress. The simplicity of the moment is both dignified and heartbreaking: In the world of “Angels in America,” beauty is not an escape from disease and death. Instead, they are cut from the same cloth.
In addition, by juxtaposing different scenes of male intimacy through staging, the play explores the ways that men are socially allowed to seek out closeness and emotional honesty. In one scene, Louis, seeking escape, abandons Prior at the hospital and goes cruising in Central Park. At the same time, Roy and Joe have a heart-to-heart about fatherhood over tumblers of whiskey. As these two scenes unfold around each other — Louis on the ground having sex with an anonymous sex worker and, less than a foot away, Roy and Joe ruminating over what it means to be a good son — the audience is asked to think about how these relationships might not be so different after all.
The staging and props also highlight how the ghosts of queer death and conservative bigotry haunt the play. In one scene, Roy and his political ally Martin are having dinner. While chatting about how they will inevitably secure Republican majorities and pass bills limiting the rights of marginalized groups, Roy and Martin hold a white sheet between them as a table, which hovers above the ground. They drop the sheet, which falls, revealing the concealed body of Prior. The audience realizes that Roy and Martin are literally talking over the dead bodies of men they have killed. In another scene, as Roy implores Joe to join him in Washington, D.C. to support President Ronald Reagan, Roy walks among white sheets on the ground. The detritus calls to mind the bodies of queer people who died due to Reagan’s policies and inaction. These design choices subtly pay tribute to others who are not featured or named in the play but still suffered and died during the AIDS epidemic.
Lastly, the production makes use of an astonishing reveal in the final scenes to signal the arrival of the Angel. Not to spoil anything, but that reveal alone makes the play worth seeing. If an utter transformation of theatrical space is what you’re looking for, “Angels in America” at Central Square Theater is the place to find it.

As it Happened: Harvard Commencement 2023
Republican megadonor Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 broke with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by opposing a new Florida law that expands a ban on teaching sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools.
Griffin, whose recent $300 million donation to Harvard renamed the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in his honor, has come under fire from Harvard students and affiliates for his support of DeSantis.
DeSantis launched his campaign for president on Wednesday, ending months of speculation that he would enter the race.
Griffin expressed support for DeSantis’ original law prohibiting gender identity and sexual orientation education through third grade, telling Forbes last spring he felt it was “a really important point of view” held by the governor.
DeSantis signed the original ban into law in March 2022, which critics dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill as it threatens Florida educators with losing their credentials for teaching lessons on the topics of gender identity and sexuality.
But Jaquelyn M. Scharnick ’06, a spokesperson for Griffin and a former Crimson News editor, wrote in an emailed statement that Griffin opposed an expansion of the ban to all grade levels, including high school, which DeSantis signed into law earlier this month.
“Like the vast majority of Americans, Ken believes that discussions on gender identity and sexual orientation should be led by parents with their children at home, rather than by teachers in elementary schools,” Scharnick wrote. “However, as a steadfast supporter of open discourse, academic freedom, and free speech, Ken disagrees with Florida’s recent rule extending the prohibition of classroom instruction on these topics through 12th grade.”
Griffin still supports the original version of the law, which remains in effect.
Griffin made national news in November 2022 when he announced his support for DeSantis. Griffin, a longtime Republican donor, gave almost $60 million to Republicans in the 2022 midterm elections. But in April, the New York Times reported that Griffin’s support for the Florida governor is not set in stone.
When asked whether Griffin still expects to support DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, Griffin spokesperson Zia Ahmed wrote in an emailed statement that “Ken continues to assess the field.”
A DeSantis spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
The move comes amid controversy among Harvard affiliates about Griffin’s donation and the GSAS renaming. Several GSAS student leaders said they were particularly upset about a requirement in Griffin’s gift agreement that all formal and informal references to GSAS include Griffin’s name, including the names of student organizations.
Student leaders in the queer community at GSAS maintain that Griffin’s split with DeSantis over the expanded policy is a moot point.
Ashley Cavanagh, a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Physics and a co-president of the Harvard LGBTQ@GSAS Association, said Griffin’s opposition to the law expanding the ban on teaching sexual orientation and gender identity through the 12th grade did not change her views on Griffin.
“It’s not that he’s opposed to some oppression, it’s more that he’s encouraging some oppression,” she said. “He still supports a degree of oppression.”
Ahmed wrote that Griffin’s views are based in the values of liberty and equal opportunity, and that criticism would not change his stances.
“Ken engages deeply on the important policy issues of our era, and encourages thoughtful debate of these topics by all Americans,” he wrote. “His views are driven by his longstanding commitment to free speech, individual rights, and ensuring opportunity in our country, not by the reactions of others.”
Cavanagh also said she thought Griffin’s opposition to the new law on the grounds that it violates academic freedom misses the point.
“At its core, the motivation of this ban is not to discourage academic discourse,” she said. “It’s to harm LGBTQ+ folks.”
Siobhan M. Kelly, a Ph.D. candidate in Religion, Gender, and Culture who used to run the GSAS Gender and Sexuality Workshop, said Griffin’s position on the expanded law “doesn’t change a damn thing.”
Citing DeSantis’ recent policies surrounding higher education in Florida, including limits on tenure at public state universities and a conservative takeover of New College of Florida, they said it was difficult to reconcile Griffin’s support of the governor with “the putative position that Harvard takes on academic freedom.”
“These are politicians that he supports, that he funds, who are diametrically opposed to the mission of equitable higher education,” Kelly said. “Which again, I would imagine would be important to Harvard, though it doesn’t seem so important that they would turn down money.”
Jason A. Newton, a Harvard spokesperson, and Rachael Dane, a spokesperson for the FAS, did not respond to a request for comment.
Top University officials — including outgoing President Lawrence S. Bacow and Penny S. Pritzker ’81, the senior fellow of Harvard’s highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation — have defended Griffin’s donation.
In an interview last month, Bacow told The Crimson that he does not believe Harvard should have “political tests” for donations.
“We don’t hold individuals responsible for the actions of their countries,” Bacow said. “We also should not hold individuals responsible for every action, every opinion of every candidate that they support.”
Other students and faculty have also emphasized the generosity of Griffin’s donation over his political views. Zad Chin ’24 said in an April interview she was “glad” for the gift and that Griffin’s politics should be “independent” of it.
Pritzker similarly dismissed political concerns over Griffin’s donation in an interview earlier this month, calling the donation “a heck of a vote of confidence.”
“He’s philanthropically very generous,” Pritzker added. “His politics are his politics.”

As it Happened: Harvard Commencement 2023
Michael D. Smith, a former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and a Computer Science professor, will be the interim dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced Tuesday.
Smith, whose term begins on July 1, will succeed outgoing dean Francis J. Doyle III, who is leaving the school to become the provost of Brown University.
“Mike is a distinguished, longstanding faculty member of SEAS, a highly regarded teacher, mentor, and advisor, and one of Harvard’s most respected and experienced leaders,” Gay wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates.
The search for a new SEAS dean began in early February, spearheaded by a 13-member faculty advisory committee. Gay’s announcement did not specify how long Smith will serve as an interim, nor did it say whether the search for a permanent dean remained ongoing.
Members of the SEAS faculty have called for a top scholar to fill the role following Doyle’s departure, as well as someone who could negotiate with residents of Allston — the location of Harvard’s Science and Engineering Complex — with a steady hand.
As FAS dean, Smith was largely responsible for guiding the school through the 2008 financial crisis, cutting FAS budgets by 15 percent across the board to save on costs. Smith also oversaw a substantial restructuring of the FAS, a fundraising effort for the school, and the beginning of the House renewal project during his tenure. Smith stepped down from the position in 2018.
Smith’s deanship was rocked by the Government 1310 cheating scandal, during which more than 100 Harvard students were investigated for cheating on a take-home exam. Smith came under fire after he covertly authorized searching email accounts of 17 resident deans as part of the investigation.
In her message, Gay praised Smith’s FAS leadership.
“Mike led the FAS with consummate skill to financial strength and stability, growth and increased diversity in the faculty, an improved and refined tenure-track system, a renewed emphasis on teaching excellence, renewal in the House system, and much more,” she wrote.
This will not be Smith’s first time in a SEAS leadership role. Prior to being selected as FAS dean, he served as the SEAS associate dean for Computer Science and Engineering.
With the announcement, Gay temporarily has deans in place for three of the four open deanships she inherited when she was chosen for Harvard’s presidency. On May 4, Gay announced Jane Kim as the interim dean for the School of Public Health and six days later, Harvard Divinity School dean David N. Hempton announced he would briefly extend his tenure in the position.
The search to fill the last open deanship — Gay’s own — also began in February, led by Gay and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. In an interview earlier this month, Gay declined to provide a timeline for selecting a new FAS dean and or confirm that one would be in place by the time she assumes the presidency on July 1.
