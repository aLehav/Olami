After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Getting an audience to laugh at jokes on race relations is no easy task. But Black Community and Student Theater Production’s “Negative”—which ran from Oct. 2 to 4 at the Adams Pool Theater—deftly achieved this.  The production highlighted the racial conversations that have become prevalent on Harvard’s campus with cohesive directing that balances satire and serious conversation.
Directed and adapted by S. Jumai Yusuf ’16, “Negative” portrays a black roommate, Veronica Scott (Caroline B. Hubbard ’17), and a white roommate, Mary Strep (Julie S. Monrad ’15) on the first day of school at Harvard. In the first act, stereotypical race relations are reversed: the white student is the minority from a humble Midwestern background, and the black roommate is a wealthy Exeter grad with a famous civil rights lawyer as a father. In line with the tone of the production, the scene is daringly funny, satirizing the microaggressions that African-American students experience. The characters’ roles switch in the nearly-identical second act, making for an uncomfortable, less humorous commentary on college racial tensions.
“Negative” handles its subject material with bravery and poignance when negotiating race politics. From the moment Veronica Scott struts onto the scene in high-heeled boots and a leather skirt and announces “I believe in egalitarianism,” it’s clear that the play embraces caricature. Although “Negative” has its fair share of classic benign microaggressions (“Your name is so exotic”), the behavior of the dominant character is often blatantly cruel and overbearing. The play even goes as far as to have the wealthy Exeter grad pay her timid roommate to carry a suitcase to storage. At first glance, it would seem easy to dismiss “Negative” as an overstated misrepresentation of college interactions. With such an exaggerated script, the challenge of staging “Negative” lies in avoiding a simplistic bully-versus-victim dynamic and keeping the scenes nuanced and relatable.
It’s a challenge that Yusuf successfully tackled. By placing “Negative” in the context of the first day at Harvard, Yusuf created a scene to which her audience could easily relate. She mirrored the lives of her audience members, minority or otherwise, by placing some very unsettling interactions into a very familiar situation. In the first act, for example, students will recognized Mary’s uncertainty that she deserves to attend Harvard, or Veronica’s reference to the abundance of Exeter grads on campus.
What made the production of “Negative” especially relatable were the commonplace details that Yusuf deliberately planted in each scene. She placed a flip phone in the hands of one character and an iPhone in the hands of the other, creating a subtle but uncomfortable contrast in socioeconomic status. As wealthy Mary of the second act pulls out her laptop, Veronica fidgets with a hand-sewn, Midwestern dress. One roommate comes to school with her belongings packed in cardboard Collegeboxes, the other with glittering garments in leather suitcases. Yusuf made sure that the play’s tension isn’t only derived from race: the disturbing interactions in “Negative” extended to disparities of wealth, regional background, and culture.
With only two characters, the realization of “Negative” as largely dependent on its actresses. Hubbard and Monrad performed with gusto, boldly adopting the mannerisms of each character. As the privileged character, they stomp confidently across the set in heels, sitting on the other girl’s desk, pawing through their roommate’s clothes, and conquering the stage of the Adams Pool Theater. Their exaggerated actions brought a comedic energy to “Negative,” and the play’s brief dance scenes (complete with fabulous moves from Hubbard and fantastic robot from Monrad), were nothing short of hilarious. As the minority roommate, the actresses displayed insecurity and distress, at times looking as if they were on the brink of tears.
The set was brilliant in its simplicity. With two desks, two closets, and a few suitcases, it had only the essential props demanded by the script and didn’t distract from the movements or lines of the actresses. The lighting was bright and harsh, reminiscent of a typical dorm room, except for one moment when a spotlight shone upon the privileged roommate as she launched into a speech about her racial tolerance. The lighting choice came unexpectedly but made for an amusing little monologue.
The play was followed by a discussion led by Harvard’s Sustained Dialogue co-moderators Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16 and Herman K. Bhupal ’16. Students of all races and backgrounds spoke of the play’s familiarity. “Negative,” with all of its exaggeration, brought  some very uncomfortable realities to light—and garnered a few laughs along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chris Thile is a 2012 MacArthur Fellow and mandolin player for the bluegrass quintet Punch Brothers, as well as the acoustic trio Nickel Creek. He’s also worked on numerous other collaborations, including the Grammy-winning album “The Goat Rodeo Sessions” with Yo-Yo Ma. Currently, Thile is touring with the bassist Edgar Meyer for their collaboration “Bass and Mandolin.” They will be performing at Sanders Theatre on Oct. 12 for the Celebrity Series of Boston.
The Harvard Crimson: How do you feel you’ve changed as a musician over the years?
Chris Thile: I think that when I was younger, though I was interested in everything I heard that I thought was good, regardless of textural aesthetic. I approached absorbing those things in a manner that I thought fit the style. So, for instance, if I was learning a Bach piece...I would kind of approach it with my little classical hat on. And if I was learning a fiddle tune, I would approach it with my folk hat on. And I think over the years I’ve realized that various instances of great music have far more in common than not in common and that they kind of transcend any sort of stylistic consideration associated with texture…. There are basically really just two genres that matter, and that’s good music and bad music. And the way that one goes about making good music needs to be as balanced in terms of intuition and learning as music itself…. And I think that what’s changed with years is rather than sort of approach what I consider to be learned music in a learned way and intuitive music in an intuitive way, I’ve realized that great music is both all the time and needs to be approached with both sides of one’s musicianship completely switched on.
THC: One thing I love about your music is how seamlessly the lyrics and the instrumental bits flow into each other. What’s your process like in terms of writing lyrics and then fitting them to the rest of a piece?
CT: Well, I guess I go about it the opposite way. To me, the lyrics are almost never the first thing. I think that that’s what makes a lyric a completely different animal from a poem, for instance: that it’s really only meant to be sung, not read. And so you need to sing it. It needs to be conceived aloud. So I think that there needs to be a melody…. I do think that the ambiguity and expression possible with music and even with vocal music needs to be treated with the respect that it deserves. That's one of the most beautiful parts of music, is how satisfying the inherently abstract expression gets. That separates music from other art forms.
It’s just important to preserve that ambiguity in a piece of music, and the lyrics need to not dictate a person’s experience. That’s actually sort of contrary to what music does best. You’re not telling people a story; you’re helping them tell their own story. I think that’s important to lyricists, and I think that’s also very important as a composer of instrumental music. That’s one of the reasons that instrumental music is thrilling for me...all the expression is abstract. So when Edgar Meyer and I play at Sanders on Sunday, there won’t be any singing, actually. It’ll be 100% instrumental, and that’s an opportunity to really explore the depths of the lyricism possible in completely instrumental music.
THC: How would you say that changes when you’re working with covers, which I know is something you’ve done a lot as well?
CT: When it’s just me or a group of people choosing to deliver someone else’s music, it tends to be because I wish I’d written it or we wish we’d written it, and that it’s something that we wouldn’t think to write ourselves…. Like, “Wow. How did this happen? How did this piece of music come to be?” And I do think that there’s no better way to understand what makes a piece of music tick then to get inside of it thoroughly enough that I could be able to perform it for someone and to deliver it as if it were your own…. I don’t cover everything that I love, because sometimes I feel like, “Oh, yeah, I understand it. I know how this happens”.... It’s when I don’t totally understand it that it intrigues me to the point of having to learn it well enough to play it for someone, and then I often find that that helps me understand it. You know, it’s almost roleplaying. So if Punch Brothers covers a Radiohead song, I’m sort of doing my little Thom Yorke roleplaying game and seeing if I can get into his head and figuring out where that music came from.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 10, 2014, at 9:42 p.m.
Eldo Kim, the Harvard College sophomore who allegedly threatened to bomb four campus buildings last December, was charged Friday with emailing bomb threats to the Harvard University Police Department, The Harvard Crimson, and two Harvard officials.
The U.S. Attorney asked Friday that the court defer prosecuting Kim for 18 months, while he takes part in a pretrial diversion program. Under the diversionary agreement, Kim will be confined to his home for four months, will have to complete 750 hours of community service, and will have to pay restitution to the law enforcement agencies active in responding to his bomb threats.
The agreement also stipulates that Kim will have to make a public apology.
The Probation Department and Pretrial Services Office will oversee Kim’s diversion program.
If the court signs off on the agreement and Kim meets its terms, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said that it plans to dismiss all charges. If Kim does not, the office will initiate criminal prosecution.
Kim, 21, was previously charged by complaint in December; he has been under supervision since then, pending a trial.
Allison D. Burroughs, Kim’s lawyer, wrote in an email Friday evening that Kim was “relieved” at not having to face felony conviction, and that he is “fully prepared” to meet the requirements of the agreement.
Burroughs added that Kim was “deeply remorseful” about what he had done and grateful that the U.S. Attorney’s Office “was willing to distinguish between a terrorist and a bright, sleep deprived kid under difficult personal circumstances who made a very poor decision.”
Kim did not appear in court Friday, according to Burroughs.
Kim allegedly sent his threats half an hour before he was scheduled to take a final exam at 9:00 a.m. on Dec. 16, 2013, according to a press release from U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz’s office. The threats provoked a massive response from local, state, and federal authorities, as well as the evacuation of the Science Center, Emerson, Sever, and Thayer halls, the closure of Harvard Yard, and the cancellation of several exams.
The closures lasted for roughly five hours as HUPD, Cambridge Police, and federal law enforcement searched campus, clearing the four threatened buildings one by one. Several noon exams were also postponed or cancelled. Many students made up the affected exams in February.
Kim’s threats were sent using Guerrilla Mail, a free application that generates temporary anonymous email addresses, according to an affidavit filed in December. Kim also used a free application called TOR, which generates a random anonymous IP address for temporary use that is difficult for law enforcement to trace.
The affidavit aid law enforcement authorities determined that Kim had accessed TOR on the Harvard network before the email was sent.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John A. Capin represented the prosecution in the case.

Harvard is used to being on the list. As the oldest college in America with the most  successful alumni, the University has enjoyed a high level of prestige for the last  three and a bit centuries. But what about the rankings that actually matter? Will Harvard students, in the words of Rihanna, ever find love in a hopeless place? The numbers are in, and the results are grim: Harvard undergraduates are neither the most or least enjoyable to date, and are unranked in many other important categories. We are, in short, irrelevant.
According to Time Magazine, a matchmaking service known as “The Dating Ring” collected feedback from over 7,500 dates in New York and San Francisco, and found that Colgate University alumni were most likely to score a second date. Other colleges on the list for enjoyable matchings included Boston University and Williams, while the most undateable hailed from Princeton, the University of Chicago, and the University of Pennsylvania. While we take comfort in the fact that we aren’t the worst daters, the fact that we rank nowhere on the list is a little worrying for a college that prides itself on a legacy of success. Are we even making an impact in the world?
Clearly not. The “Daily Beast” released a list of the 20 sexiest colleges in the United States, and while Yale ranked number seven, Harvard, yet again, did not make the list. You might think we would have more luck in the brains department, but once again, we fall short. The top 25 colleges where students are “both hot and smart” include familiar names such as Wesleyan, Boston College, and Yale. Although these findings may help explain why so many freshman boys choose to leave campus on Friday nights in search of parties they can actually get into, or why Harvard-Yale is reputed to be the best weekend on campus, they also point to a decidedly “average” level of attractiveness for Harvard students.
It’s okay, Harvard. The dictionary defines “failure” as a deficiency in a desirable quality, so that means we’re just missing one piece of the puzzle, not all of it! Right?
