After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 7, 2014, at 12:09 a.m.
After four years of research and drafting by the Academic Integrity Committee, members of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved the College’s first-ever honor code at their final regular monthly meeting of the year on Tuesday, laying out formal expectations for academic integrity and creating a new student-faculty/administrator judicial board to hear cases regarding the violation of those expectations.
Likely beginning in the fall of 2015, all College students will be required to make a regular affirmation of integrity, the nature and frequency of which will be determined next year, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. Incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will recommend specific logistics concerning this affirmation to the Faculty Council, and subsequently the full Faculty will vote on the final details.
“This is a big step,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said after the meeting, though he noted that there is “a lot more work to be done.”


Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who served on the Academic Integrity Committee for two years and voiced his support for the honor code at the meeting on Tuesday, said the vote marks an important step in a longer process.
“The impact will probably be small, but I think over time it will help to create that culture shift where people really value academic integrity and personal integrity,” he said.
 
The Committee on Academic Integrity will continue to meet in the coming academic year to discuss the implementation of the honor code.
“Our hope is that in the coming years that the code catalyzes hundreds of conversations and reminds us of what it means to be part of the Harvard College community,” incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email Tuesday.
With this significant policy shift, Harvard joins a long list of peer institutions who already have similar systems regarding academic integrity. Yale now remains the only school in the Ivy League without an honor code.
The honor code, the first in Harvard’s 377-year history, also includes the creation of the Harvard College Honor Board. Unlike the Administrative Board, the body that currently hears such cases, the new honor board will include student members, in addition to resident deans, other faculty, administrators, and graduate students who have served as teaching fellows. The Dean of the College, or the dean’s designee, will serve as chair of the board, according to the approved proposal.
Tuesday’s meeting marks the fourth time members of the Faculty have gathered to discuss the honor code over the past two years, following several discussions during which professors expressed concern over the potential impact of the policy and its ability to change the campus culture toward cheating. Members of the Faculty Council voted 13 in favor and two opposed to the new honor code at their April 30 meeting.
Although faculty members spoke and voted overwhelmingly in favor of the new policy, which was presented by Harris, who chairs the Academic Integrity Committee, some professors who spoke during the meeting said that they are unconvinced that the affirmation of integrity is an effective means for curtailing the problem of cheating at Harvard.
"I haven’t heard the evidence that the device that is proposed here gets at the problems at hand," said Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, former Dean of the College.
Senior Lecturer in Computer Science David J. Malan ’99 also voiced concerns, saying that the favored “cultural interventions and new social norms over new policies and structures.”
Despite these concerns, Harris said that research into honor codes shows that they are effective in lowering rates of cheating at schools that implement them.
“It is critical that we move in [accordance] with the research,” he said.
For the second time this semester at a Faculty meeting, Lewis asked Harris whether or not the affirmation of integrity would be mandatory or voluntary and, if it were mandatory, what “sanctions” students would face for refusing to make the affirmation.
Although Harris said at February's meeting that the affirmation would be required, he did not explain how students might be reprimanded if they chose not to make the affirmation at either April’s or Tuesday’s meeting.
The honor code will not include a requirement that students report instances of cheating that they observe. In addition, under the new policy, exams will continue to be proctored.
College students, while unsure about the implications of the Honor Code, expressed their support for the approved legislation Tuesday evening.
“I don’t know much about it, but I think an honor code is a good idea to have a set of guidelines,” Alex B. Miller ’15 said. “It’s good to understand an institution’s moral compass.”
Miller added that the student voice on the Honor Board seems to be a positive change. “I think it’s a good idea to share the students’ perspective and not have discussions be one-sided,” he said.
Stephanie Fuller ’16 said that the effects of the policy are not yet clear. “For the people who are determined to get the grade no matter what, it might not stop them,” she said. “I think it might be helpful for students in moments of weakness.”
For Caitlin M. Watson ’14, the new policy is a worthwhile step. “I know it’s worked at other Ivy League schools, so it’s definitely worth a try here,” she said.
The new policy is the product of four years of work by the Academic Integrity Committee, which was first convened in 2010, but accelerated its efforts to draft an honor code on the heels of the Government 1310 cheating scandal in the fall of 2012.
The committee originally presented its first honor code draft to the Faculty last April. That draft outlined a five-point proposal, which included a number of stipulations that are not included in the finalized version of the honor code policy approved on Tuesday.
In its first version, the honor code included a “declaration of integrity” to be written on all assignments, projects, and final exams. In addition, the Committee suggested that students may be asked to make a similar affirmation upon matriculation to the College.
Although the student role in Harvard College Honor Board marks a significant change in the school’s policy, a Student-Faculty Judicial Board currently exists to hear cases that fall outside of the domain of the Faculty. This body, however, has heard just one case since its inception in 1987, according to the Ad Board’s website.
German professor Peter J. Burgard highlighted two grammatical issues and a punctuation error within the proposed language, all of which were accepted by Harris as a friendly amendment and adopted along with the rest of the policy.
The Faculty also approved a switch to a course credit system instead of the half-course protocol currently used and a revision to the student handbook allowing rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors to submit requests for mixed-gender housing groups to their House administrators.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 6, 2014, at 7:45 p.m.
Starting in the fall of 2015, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will adopt a course credit system that will convert current half-courses in Harvard College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences into four-credit courses and open up the possibility for a wide range of new course offerings worth fewer than four credits each.
The new policy was approved by a voice vote by the members of FAS at their monthly meeting on Tuesday, where the Faculty also approved a new College honor code and changes to the school’s policy regarding gender-neutral housing. There was no debate or discussion at Tuesday’s meeting regarding either of these two topics, both of which were also unanimously supported by the Faculty Council.
Graduation requirements will remain virtually unchanged under the new policy. Undergraduates, currently required to complete 32 half-courses, will be able to obtain the 128 credits needed to graduate by enrolling in and passing four courses each semester.
The new system of accreditation will be launched alongside the Student Information System, a centralized software platform which will be used to track student enrollment. That software is designed with course credits as its default metric. Reconfiguring the program to use half-courses instead would be both time-consuming and expensive, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said in the April meeting of the Faculty.
Conversion to the credit system resolves a number of other pragmatic concerns, according to Harris.
“Our course unit system complicates our ability to meet the reporting requirements, since the government bases its benchmarks and standards on a credit system,” Harris said in an interview in April.
In addition, the half-course system is difficult for employers, other institutions, and loan officers to understand, FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said in an April interview. The new system would solve this complication by aligning Harvard’s practices with those of most peer institutions as well as other schools within the University.
With the switch, the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid will no longer have to convert the College’s course units into credits when it reports information to the U.S. Department of Education, according to Burke.
Although current half-courses will be converted to count for four credits each, the new system presents the possibility for an array of new course options that do not conform to the standard model. These new courses could span different time periods than just a semester or full year, such as labs, quarter courses, and J-term courses. While FAS currently offers a few “less-than half” courses, this policy change will allow the College to better track these courses, granting professors more freedom in their class design.
The Faculty also approved a change to the Harvard College Handbook for Students that offered new language concerning gender-neutral housing, transitioning the existing pilot program into a College-wide policy.
The change strikes existing language that says that “[...] the College ordinarily requires single-gender living arrangements. Thus, the Office of Student Life may, in consultation with the Houses, permit mixed-gender rooming groups in certain circumstances, such as to accommodate students with a gender-based need (i.e., transgender students).”
Instead, the new policy will allow rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors to request mixed-gender rooming groups conditional upon all occupants voluntarily agreeing to the arrangement. As with all rooming inquiries, the new policy states that these requests will be managed by the House administrator “on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all circumstances, including space constraints,” according to the proposal.
“I look forward to the day when all students across this campus can go into their Houses and form gender neutral housing arrangements without having to go through major hurdles,” Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said.
The new policy change comes after the conclusion of a two-year gender-neutral housing pilot program in a set of Houses. Last fall, 85 percent of undergraduates who participated in the annual Undergraduate Council presidential election voted in favor of a referendum that called for gender-neutral housing options across all Houses at the College.
The Faculty approved this change along with several other updates to the Handbook on Tuesday, including clarification regarding hazing that incorporates language from the Massachusetts Hazing Statute to the College Policy on Hazing as well as details regarding “drugging” from Massachusetts state law.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: May 6, 2014, at 9:31 p.m.
After months of scrutiny directed at the University’s policies concerning sexual assault, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced Tuesday the creation of an FAS committee charged with bringing Harvard’s largest branch into compliance with a University-wide sexual assault policy still being reviewed by the Federal Office for Civil Rights.
In an email sent to the FAS community, Smith wrote that University President Drew G. Faust has instructed Harvard’s schools to update their respective response and disciplinary procedures regarding cases of sexual assault, even as the revised policy—which has not been released—still awaits approval.
Smith wrote that History professor Alison Frank Johnson will chair the new committee.
“Our job is to make sure that the policies and procedures we have to address sexual misconduct within FAS reflect what our community needs and deserves, as well as what the law is and what the central policy requires,” Johnson said on Tuesday afternoon.
Johnson added that while the University has been working on its revised sexual misconduct policies for some time, recent events—most notably personal accounts of difficulty with institutional sexual assault policies at Harvard and across the country—have provided a noticeable sense of urgency.
“Harvard moves slowly and a lot of this work was started before [spring 2014], but it is also true that students have played an essential role in advocating for change at Harvard and nationally,” she said. “Many of the people I have spoken to who are willing to help are motivated... by their own personal experiences and the experiences of those close to them.”
Johnson said Tuesday that she hopes the committee will meet twice before Commencement exercises at the end of May, and that the body  “will move quickly to a set of recommendations in the fall.”
The FAS committee is the newest of a number of University-sanctioned groups focused on sexual assault prevention and response. Last May, inaugural Title IX coordinator Mia Karvonides convened a working group to evaluate Harvard’s policies regarding sexual assault. Over the course of eleven months, the Karvonides group drafted the new, University-wide policy on sexual assault which is currently under review at the OCR.
On April 3, Faust announced the creation of a task force on sexual assault, chaired by former University Provost Steven E. Hyman, that she said was aimed at making suggestions for preventing sexual assault on campus.
The 21-member FAS committee will include four students—two undergraduates and two graduate students—and 17 faculty and staff members. Both Johnson and Smith emphasized that they do not expect the student members to fully represent the voices of the student body.
“We need everyone to know that you don’t have to be on the committee to have your voice heard by the committee,” Johnson said.
The faculty members of the committee include Johnson, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor Michael Aziz, English professor Stephen L. Burt ’93, English and African and African American Studies professor Glenda R. Carpio, Latin American studies professor David Carrasco, History professor Nancy F. Cott, Psychology professor Jill M. Hooley, Biology professor James J. McCarthy, South Asian Studies Department Chair Parimal G. Patil, Philosophy and African and African American Studies professor Tommie Shelby, Music professor Anne Shreffler, and Law School professor Ronald Sullivan Jr, the master of Winthrop House.
The administrators on the committee include Assistant Dean for Faculty Affairs Kwok Wah Yu, Senior Human Resources Consultant Sandy Stergiou, Dean for GSAS Student Affairs Garth McCavana, Harvard College Associate Dean for Student Life William Cooper ’94, Interim Secretary of the Administrative Board Brett Flehinger, and Dudley House Resident Dean Karen Flood.
The four students who have been invited to serve on the committee were not identified in Smith’s announcement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In remarks to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at their monthly meeting on Tuesday, University President Drew G. Faust condemned the Divest Harvard-led blockade of Massachusetts Hall last week and reassured professors that the University does not take into account the political views and actions of tenure candidates in making tenure decisions.
Commenting on last week’s blockade of Massachusetts Hall by Divest Harvard student activists, which resulted in the arrest of one undergraduate, Faust mentioned the importance of free speech in the University.
“We fully respect the rights of members of our community to express their views freely and robustly,” she said.
But Divest Harvard members, she said, went beyond the limits of their free speech by “infringing on the rights of other community members to conduct their normal activities.”
She added that there is a need for this open conversation, yet that Divest Harvard members had acted outside of these bounds.
“Blocking the entrance to buildings, following and videotaping me and then editing and posting my words in ways that misrepresent them are not part of reasoned and civil discourse,” she said.
Faust also responded to a letter submitted to her last week by members of the Faculty Council—FAS’s top elected body—in which members expressed their concerns that a candidate’s political views and actions might be considered during the tenure process. Faust denied that allegation to the faculty Tuesday.
The letter from the Faculty Council comes in the wake of Associate Anthropology professor Kimberly Theidon’s allegations that she was denied tenure last May because of her public support for victims of sexual assault.
Theidon filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination in late March, claiming that the University violated Title IX by by denying her tenure in May 2013 for engaging in speech and conduct protected by federal anti-discrimination law.
Faust reaffirmed the University’s commitment to free speech, saying, “I do wish to emphasize that free and open speech are essential to everything we do as a community of learning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 7, 2014, at 2:30 a.m.
“One, two, three, four...” Linda Muri was counting steps as she approached the Boston Marathon finish line when she noticed a wave of sound traveling alongside her. Though there were nearly 50 others runners around her, the loudest cheers seemed to be moving in harmony with each one of her steps.
Then Muri saw a shadow behind her and turned her head to see a woman pointing to her and revving up the crowd. Eight weeks ago, Muri would have been just another one of the 35,000-plus runners, easy to overlook amidst all the commotion and excitement on Boylston Street.
But on Marathon Monday, a bright pink shirt and recently shaved head, though hidden partially by a men’s freshman lightweight crew hat, set her apart.Tipped off by Muri’s appearance and the gestures of the woman running behind her, the thousands of spectators who descended upon Boylston Street raised the volume of their cheering and clapping to an even higher decibel.
Their screams and exclamations of ‘Boston Strong’ replaced the sounds of sirens, cries, and chaos that had filled the same air just a year before.
For Muri, the ‘Boston Strong’ slogan seemed especially applicable.
Six weeks before the marathon, Muri was diagnosed with breast cancer. Three weeks before the marathon, Muri started chemotherapy. With the marathon on day eight of her second 14-day cycle of treatment, Muri was not sure she would be able to run the entire course even when the race started. Muri tapped into the wave of cheers that accompanied her as she neared the finish line.
These final steps on Boylston marked not just the completion of a goal she set for herself one year ago, but also an affirmation that even cancer would not stop her.
A week later, the memory of Boylston Street still gives Muri goosebumps.
“There were so many people, I was overcome,” Muri said. “I felt like people were thanking me for being there, but I was thanking them for being there, for coming back and knowing that it was okay to do this.”
FROM 2K to 42K
For Muri, coach of the men’s freshman lightweight crew team and a three-time rowing world champion, the 2K is a familiar distance. 42K? Not so much.
After last year’s tragedy, Muri felt compelled to leave her comfort zone in the water and take to the blacktop. Not only was she standing at the finish line of last year’s marathon before leaving for afternoon crew practice, but she also resides within the 20-block radius of Watertown closed down in the search for the second of the two bombers.
“I wanted to show my support for the people who were…injured and killed and be a part of the resiliency of the greater Boston community,” Muri said.
Muri maintained her fitness level by rowing in a single and running a couple of times a week during the fall. Her running increased in volume as she began an 18-week training program in December.
The coach’s first longer training run of 14 miles fell on her team’s winter training trip in Florida, so after Muri disappeared to run for a few hours, she told her team about her plans to run the marathon.
One member of her team was also making plans to get involved with the marathon. Sophomore Brett Biebelberg had applied to work as an EMT in the Boston Marathon medical unit. After a competitive application process, Biebelberg earned a slot on the medical sweep team.
Biebelberg knew that Muri was running, and she knew that he was volunteering, so they planned to meet up at some point on Marathon Monday.
But on March 14, everything changed. Muri was diagnosed with breast cancer and was scheduled to begin chemotherapy a couple of weeks later. Over spring break, Muri missed practice for the first time all year for a follow-up doctor’s appointment. A few days later, she told the team about her diagnosis. Recounting the team meeting that day, freshman Ian Meyer remembers that she maintained her poise and even her sense of humor when she shared the news.
“She told us she might need to relax the no buzz-cut policy on the team because she was diagnosed with breast cancer,” Meyer said. “Everyone was just shocked because she didn’t drop a beat in saying it.”
After the announcement, her team members lamented the fact that she could no longer run the marathon.
But Muri never ruled it out. She told her oncologist that she was training for the marathon and asked if she could still do it. The oncologist told Muri that for most people, the answer would be an automatic no, but for her they would base the decision on her response to the first two weeks of treatment. So Muri kept on training.
After the first cycle of treatment, and Muri received the green light.
THE LAST 500
Five hundred meters is a distance Muri knows well from the water. It means that the end is in sight, and it is time for a sprint to the finish.
As Muri learned, the 500 meters at the end of a marathon is very different. It is less of a sprint than an absolute last-ditch effort as a runner taps into that final bit of energy to will oneself across the finish line. It is also the point when runners most feed off the energy and support of the crowds.
As Muri made the turn onto Hereford Street, she heard one of her freshman team members, Matthew O’Connor, shouting, “Here she comes, here she comes!” Up ahead, the rest of her team awaited in their knee-high pink socks, holding signs that said “Last 500” and “Sit Up and Go.”
“After seeing them, I knew I wasn’t going to walk anymore,” Muri said.
As soon as Meyer found out Muri planned to go ahead with the race, he started making arrangements. The freshman set up a Facebook group to communicate with the team.
Meyer also planned the logistics of making signs and getting to the finish line on Monday afternoon. He coordinated with Muri’s husband and set up BAA text alerts to make sure they didn’t miss her.
All of Meyer’s efforts and worries about whether or not it would work were overcome with pride the moment he saw her.
“She’s an amazing athlete and an amazing person,” Meyer said. “Seeing her run over and actually take off her hat and wave it to the crowd was really quite something.”
The support for Muri extends beyond just her team and the marathon, but throughout the entire rowing community. All of the rowers at Harvard now race in tall pink socks in her honor.
Members of the Crimson rowing community nominated her for ‘Crew of the Week’ on popular rowing website Row 2k, an award usually given to an entire team or school. Muri blew the other candidates out of the water, receiving 52.7 percent of the vote.
In her team’s race against Yale, the Bulldogs’ freshman lightweight coach painted the white part of the team’s boat oars pink in her honor. A week later, the Georgetown rowers raced in pink shirts.
The outpouring of support from the rowing community does not surprise Kate Woll, a volunteer coach for Harvard-Radcliffe’s women heavyweight team and long-time friend of Muri’s.
“She meets every athlete that she works with head-on and in an upstanding way and works to make them their absolute best,” Woll said. “It’s not about her. It’s never about her. It’s just about them.”
Muri has named Woll her “care captain,” as Woll has taken the lead in processing requests by members of the rowing community to help and lend support. Woll set up a website to process emails from people reaching out to ease Muri’s months of treatment.
“It makes people feel better that they’re supporting me, and that’s what counts,” Muri said. “A lot of people don’t know what to say or what to do. If they have something that they can do that makes them feel better, that’s good for me, because it really helps to have all that support.”
ACROSS THE FINISH
On the day of the marathon, Biebelberg went into Boston around 7 a.m. for meetings with the rest of the medical personnel. The area beyond the finish line was divided into over 20 zones, with specific medical teams assigned to each zone.
Biebelberg was placed in zone one, the area that was immediately after the finish line. He identified runners who looked like they were in distress or were about to be in distress. If he thought they might need medical care, he would approach them to better assess whether they could continue walking or needed further assistance.
As the day progressed, Biebelberg kept watching the clock. He knew Muri didn’t leave until wave four and he realized that the heat was slowing many of the runners down.
As the day approached 4 p.m., he scanned the runners for bright pink shirts and white hats.
Eventually, he spotted Muri 100 feet from the finish line. When she crossed, he immediately shouted her name and they embraced. For both Muri and Biebelberg, words could not capture that moment.
“We’re all just so happy to know her, to know somebody who is as strong as her and who has maintained a smile and a sense of humor in the face of adversity,” Biebelberg said. “In that respect she’s a great role model not just for her athletes but for anyone going through tough times.”

Most of us probably didn’t choose Harvard to train and prepare us for a military career in the mountains of Europe. However, history suggests that perhaps we have been too shortsighted when considering our future pursuits. 
In need of smart, athletic, patriotic folks to serve in the Alps during World War II, the United States Army formed a regiment of primarily Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth students: the 10th Mountain Division.
An unconventional unit, the 10th was brought together because the rough terrain of the region required individuals educated in outdoor sportsmanship. The National Ski Patrol System worked with the Army to recruit expert skiers, in addition to climbers, mountain men, lumberjacks, and cowboys, from around the country. As the demographic make-up of the regiment shows, such skilled skiers tended to come from upper class, highly educated backgrounds.
In fact, of all the American divisions, the 10th had the highest percentage of both high school and college graduates. “Ninety percent of the kids [in the regiment] were former college students from out east, Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, the whole eastern group. We always said they were the only ones that could afford to ski in those days, right after the Depression. They came from wealthy families but it was a unique group,” veteran and infantryman of the 10th Mountain Division Donald J. Kindt said to the Wisconsin Veterans Museum Research Center in 1994.
Recruits endured a unique training period in Colorado, practicing skiing, climbing, hiking, and general mountaineering. While that description might read like a fun ski vacation in Aspen, the training was strenuous, resulting in frequent hospitalizations for exhaustion and frostbite.
The 10th were called late in the war, to fight German mountain troops in the Riva Ridge area of the Italian Appennines in 1945. Demobilized (temporarily) following World War II, the regiment was remembered for its camaraderie and determination and declared “the greatest unit to ever fight in Italy,” by General Mark Clark, the Allied commander in the country.
Here’s to the Harvard soldiers and outdoorsmen of the 10th Mountain Division!
