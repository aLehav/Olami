After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ken Loach—winner of the 2006 Palme D’Or and a director who has earned a reputation for tackling difficult social issues in his work—returns to Cannes with a seething indictment of bureaucratic impersonality. “I, Daniel Blake,” simply shot and minimally edited, is drenched in visceral and unadulterated realism. It is also one of the most powerful and moving films in recent memory.
“Daniel Blake” tells the story of its titular character, a kind-hearted middle-aged Newcastle carpenter who, after suffering a heart attack, is forced to stop working. Turning to the welfare state for assistance, he is confronted with the tragic realities of a modern society bogged down by miles of cold and unfeeling red tape.
Here’s what’s particularly distressing: Daniel, a hard-working and generous soul who has simply fallen on hard times, embodies the very reason social safety nets are created, yet the system engineered ostensibly to give a much-needed break to such decent men seems more intent on pounding its supposed beneficiaries into submission. Exasperated at every turn by the almost laughable inefficiencies of a blindingly complicated network, Daniel is bounced from one broken program to the next. Whether they be for employment insurance or a job seeker’s allowance, there are always stupefying catches; ridiculous paperwork; and government employees who appear completely incapable of empathizing with the plight of the unfortunate waiting around the corner.
Known for employing relatively obscure on-screen talent to superb effect, Loach has found yet another cast of unheralded gems in “Daniel Blake.” In particular, Dave Johns’s leading performance as everyman Daniel Blake is an absolute tour de force. His ability to seamlessly synthesize brilliant comedic timing (Johns is a comedian by profession) with heart-wrenching pathos lies at the heart of the film’s dynamic appeal, lending credibility to a polemic screenplay which might have otherwise languished in excessive pedantry. Johns’s supporting cast, with a stand-out in the form of Hayley Squires as a down-on-her-luck single mom, is equally impressive.
Beyond the quality of its acting performances, what ultimately makes “I, Daniel Blake” a great film is its honesty. A film like this could have easily been mawkish and exploitative. However, Ken Loach resists the temptation to poeticize or romanticize, opting instead for the version that rings truest. The movie’s stunning finale, a darker and more unforgiving ending than many may have hoped for, is a testament to Loach’s masterful restraint.
“I, Daniel Blake” is a ballad for the common man—or perhaps it is a eulogy. We are not our National Insurance Number and we are not blips on a screen, the film tells us. If we are to retain our humanity, such is a message we must all take to heart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Uchenik (The Student),” Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov paints a haunting picture of a student’s violent descent into religious fanaticism and the horrific consequences that follow. To call the film an impeachment of religion or even religious fervor, however, would not be entirely accurate. “The Student” is not a cautionary tale against piety—it is an admonition of obsession, and a powerful one at that.
The “student” in question is a lanky teenager by the name of Veniamin (Pyotr Skvortsov). An unremarkable pupil and the son of an overworked divorcée, Venya turns to a purist form of Christianity in search of a sense of worth and belonging, self-studying furiously (as evidenced by a clearly well-read pocket Bible) and amassing an encyclopedic memory of the Holy Scripture. As the film proceeds, he becomes more and more belligerent in his faith, quoting book and verse with such frequency that his increasingly evangelical tirades become dominated by words which are not his own. Director Serebrennikov cleverly superimposes on the screen each biblical reference that Venya invokes, a somewhat gimmicky but nonetheless effective tactic in demonstrating the breadth and depth of Venya’s obsession.
Venya’s transformation compels him to wage a moral crusade at school against alleged evils— among these bikini-wearing, the teaching of evolutionism, and sexual health education—encountering strong resistance from a teacher, Elena Krasnova (Viktoriya Isakova). It’s clear that director Serebrennikov intends her to be the voice of reason: Elena’s futile attempts to reform Venya are an important reflection of how far gone he is by the end of the film. Indeed, even when Elena begins to call on biblical passages herself to counter Venya’s fiery proselytization, Venya refuses to constructively engage with her opinion, instead branding her a liar and even plotting to do her bodily harm.
As can be expected from a film adaption of a stage play, “The Student” is replete with stellar, rapid-fire dialogue in which different worldviews and ideologies clash vigorously and meaningfully. While it’s not difficult to see which side the director leans toward, the opinions featured in the film’s passionate on-screen debates are never flimsy straw men—Serebrennikov does not merely pay lip service to Venya’s fundamentalism but rather digs deep into its twisted rational underpinnings. The fact that the film centers on Christian fundamentalism is also important and valuable: With the attention of the world fixed on radical Islam, “The Student” demonstrates how it is not any particular religion that results in senseless violence. Any doctrine or affiliation pursued to the point of zealotry and obsession is blinding.
That “The Student” will likely never see a wide non-Russian audience is a shame, and not just at a cinematic level. Full-blooded and hauntingly insightful, Serebrennikov’s latest film is a must-see for any who note the disorder of the world and count themselves among the perplexed and the alarmed.

Roald Dahl was well known for refusing to treat the young heroes of his novels like children, opting instead to present them with candidly harsh situations and challenges. His pre-pubescent leads were certainly up for the task. Indeed, they were almost always wiser and more moral than their adult counterparts.
As a director, Steven Spielberg has at times shown himself to be a similar breed of storyteller. Films like “E.T.” and “A.I.: Artificial Intelligence” have painted worlds in which intelligent and incorruptible young protagonists must confront evils that a cynical and jaded adult society alone never could. Given these similarities, it seems only fitting that the renowned director should finally take on the task of adapting a Roald Dahl classic.
Originally published in 1982, “The BFG” recounts the fantastical tale of a young girl named Sophie who befriends a kind-hearted and peaceful giant—the aptly-named “Big Friendly Giant,” or simply BFG. Together, Sophie and the BFG embark on a quest to rid the world of the latter’s more ferocious and carnivorous brethren, enlisting the help of the Queen of England in the process.
Spielberg’s rendition is quite faithful to the original, directly borrowing certain lines and employing the BFG’s trademark Dahlian neologisms to great effect. Like most recent adaptations of Dahl’s work, however (Tim Burton’s “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” being the prime example), “The BFG” suffers from too much attention to Dahl’s distinctive visual style and not nearly enough on the narrative purity which made his stories timeless fairy tales.
Thanks to advances in CGI technology, the film succeeds in effortlessly bringing the beautiful world of “Giant Country” to life. In particular, the BFG himself, portrayed by Mark Rylance using motion-capture technology, is stunningly reminiscent of the original Quentin Blake illustrations found in Dahl’s novel. Needless to say, fans of the book will likely find the world of “The BFG” exactly as they imagined it.
Rylance, who recently won an Oscar working with Spielberg in “The Bridge of Spies” (and who will be teaming up with Spielberg again on his next film, “The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara”) turns in an admirable performance as the titular giant, granting the character a real sense of humanity and fragility. Eleven-year-old Ruby Barnhill is similarly well cast as the precocious little Sophie. As Mara Wilson did on the set of “Matilda” 20 years ago, Barnill deftly handles the tall order of portraying a child who is truly an old soul. The combined efforts of the film’s two lead actors, however, are not enough to render the film a classic on the level of its source material. The film’s over-emphasis on visual flair serves to distract viewers from the story itself, and there are many instances in which effects both more practical and more subtle would have lessened the damage.
In “Cinderella” and this year’s “Jungle Book,” Disney was able to strike the perfect balance between unadulterated fantasy and computer-generated wonder. “The BFG” is a charming and captivating spectacle with strong performances to boot, but unfortunately it is unable to find similarly stable ground.

People who don’t like “American Honey” might accuse it of being cheesy, clichéd, and fragmented, akin to a 140-minute-long music video or Instagram post. But people who do like this movie—and there are many—would merely shrug and say: Isn’t everyone’s adolescence a bit cheesy and clichéd? Indeed, the film succeeds primarily due to the honesty, intimacy, and spontaneity with which it portrays its protagonists. Instead of telling a story, it tells of life itself.
When 18-year-old Star (Sasha Lane) has had enough of her boring, poverty-ridden life, she joins a traveling magazine sales crew that spends more time partying than working. While this narrative makes up the plot of the first 30 minutes of the film, after that half hour “American Honey” resembles nothing so much as it does a delicately shot travel log. The film consists of moments and feelings rather than a storyline: Boys fighting half-naked on top of a caravan; girls playing with a pet hamster; the whole crew singing and dancing to Rihanna before falling into a deep sleep. In the flickering light of a bonfire, there are faces, bodies, sweat, tears, and a goodnight kiss.
This kiss is shared between Jake (Shia LaBeouf) and Star herself. The first person Star gets to know in the group, Jake also coaches her on how to sell magazines—by making up beautiful lies about raising money from charity, of course. Mature, caring, and experienced, he soon attracts her affection as she blossoms from a little girl to a woman and begins to think of him as her only support. Both LaBeouf and Lane deliver beautiful, unforgettable performances. It is hard to find in LaBeouf any trace of a star: He seems to have grown up living Jake’s lower-class life, so much so that when he teaches Star his street-smart tricks to talk people into buying magazines, it appears as though LaBeouf himself would be able to survive on the basis of these skills should he ever quit his acting career. Lane, despite lacking professional acting experience prior to this film, offers a natural and relatable interpretation of the complexities of a teenage girl’s mind. Her shyness in front of LaBeouf’s character is particularly endearing, and despite the challenges inherent to the task of an actress playing the lead in her debut film—not to mention one in which almost two-thirds of the shots focus on her—Lane effortlessly achieves perfection.
From the elliptical story and the use of handheld camera throughout the film, it is very tempting to speculate that director Andrea Arnold shot “American Honey” with neither script nor storyboard, instead embarking on a road trip with the whole crew, capturing spontaneous reactions along the way. How otherwise could a screenwriter craft such organic dialogues and interactions? How could an actor deliver such a genuine and convincing performance? How could a director picture all those location-specific shots in pre-production? And how could a cinematographer capture the spirit of American Midwest, presupposing nothing, without setting herself out in the landscape and filming what she sees? The sense of freedom and spontaneity  “American Honey” possesses is both its biggest merit and an aesthetic practice increasingly rare on the big screen.
The flip side of this spontaneity is an apparent casualness of cinematography and a lack of consistent character development. Some critics may point out that any shot in the film looks as though it could have been taken by a 17-year-old Instagram user, but that quality does not actually detract from the film. The protagonists of “American Honey” are exactly the kinds of people who would keep a record of their travels on social media; filming from their perspective imbues the film with an invaluable realism. Similarly, the flatness of character development is also more of a merit than a weakness, as it more closely resembles life. In reality, not all experiences, not even the life-changing ones, have immediate and specific impacts on one’s personality. At the end of the film, Star seems to have matured significantly—and yet in some respects she has changed very little from the beginning, making for a much more realistic depiction.
“American Honey” is a web that captures the feelings of adolescence as they drift in the wind. These sentiments are happy and melancholic; sometimes clichéd but always genuine. This beautiful work consolidates Arnold’s position as a quintessential film auteur of our age and witnesses some of the industry’s most remarkable performances in recent years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If every Harvard student were required to watch Alejandro Jodorowsky's “Poesía Sin Fin (Endless Poetry),” one imagines that the number of students pursuing art might triple. The veteran Chilean director’s new film impresses with contagious passion and stunning imagination. Its flamboyant cinematography and set design sync perfectly with its theme of celebrating life and art, resulting in an unforgettable carnival.
The story is simple and certainly not novel: Young Alejandrito rebels against the career in medicine that his parents have planned for him and instead chooses to pursues his dream of being a poet. In the course of this adventure, he meets like-minded friends and lovers exploring all forms of art. The artist commune central to the film is easily compared to the Bauhaus school of the 1920s, the Beat movement of the 1950s, or that of the director’s own experience—Jodorowsky is himself a poet; the childhood scene in the film was shot on the street where he grew up; and he plays the older version of the protagonist who shares his name.
What makes “Endless Poetry” great is how it tells its story. Far from being a realistic biopic, the film is full of surreal plot elements, fantastic set design, and narratives that constantly break the fourth wall. Shot by Christopher Doyle, who famously collaborated with Wong Kar-Wai on works such as “In the Mood for Love” and “2046,” the picture features a sumptuous color palette that itself seems like a work painted by the artists in the film. And like those young talents, the director follows no rules when it comes to artistic creation. An earthquake shakes the scene when the protagonist gets into a furious argument with his parents, and a carnival sweeps the streets after he comes to the realization that the meaning of life is to revel in the moment. In one standout scene, Alejandro meets his first love, a poet with long scarlet hair, in a somber café where everyone dresses in black and moves in slow motion.
Also contributing to the euphoric energy of the film is its brilliant soundtrack: Spanish guitar and folk music inflect the film with a taste of Latin American exuberance. The characters often dance together to such music, sing out their dreams, and improvise performances. In such scenes, the director deftly conveys the idea that the beauty of art lies in its power to express emotion.
If there is any problem with “Endless Poetry,” it is that every shot looks like the craziest, and every scene tries to be the most memorable. Excessive artistic creativity leads to a slight imbalance in storytelling, and it seems sometimes that style eclipses content. Portions of the film could benefit from more traditional storytelling and cinematography choices that, if nothing else, would better prepare viewers for the more impassioned parts by allowing them a moment’s rest. However, this minor imperfection is one often spotted and easily forgiven in a young artist’s work.
“Endless Poetry” truly lives up to its title: It flows like a poem, powered by emotion and imagination. It inspires and radiates and is surely here to stay.

In a record donation to the Harvard Graduate School of Education, The Saul Zaentz Charitable Foundation gifted $35.5 million to establish an early childhood education initiative, bringing the school’s campaign to 93 percent of its total goal.
The GSE’s campaign has raised $233 million of its $250 million goal,  according to Daphne Layton, the Education School's senior associate dean for development and alumni relations. The University has surpassed its overall $6.5 billion goal in a record-breaking fundraising drive, but some schools are still trying to meet their own localized goals.
The Saul Zaentz Early Childhood Initiative, the first of its kind in the United States, will aim to strengthen preschool education by sponsoring research in the field, improving educational curriculum for early childhood students, sponsoring fellowships for interested students and faculty, and providing better development opportunities for professionals in the field.
Specifically, the initiative will fund a research study and an early childhood professional learning academy. Led by Graduate School of Education professor Nonie K. Lesaux and associate professor Stephanie M. Jones, the Harvard Early Learning Study will track the effect of early learning experiences on the development of a group of three year-old children encompassing a wide variety of socioeconomic, racial, and linguistic backgrounds.  The Saul Zaentz Academy for Professional Learning in Early Childhood will provide in-person and online learning programs for professionals in the early childhood education field.
Additionally, the gift will establish the Saul Zaentz Fellows Program, which will sponsor eight GSE master's degree fellowships and one  fellowship in the Doctor of Education Leadership Program.
The initiative will also endow two chairs at the GSE: one for tenured or tenure-track faculty, and one for “practice-based” faculty working in early childhood learning.
Lesaux said the gift brings much-needed attention to a field that “hasn’t always historically been part of conversations about education” in the past.
“I think this [initiative] is a very strong signal that the years before formal schooling are crucial,” she said. “It’s critical that institutions like Harvard get behind the field as it continues to both expand and improve in order to promote healthy early development that lasts a lifetime.”
Dean of the Graduate School of Education James E. Ryan said the donation aligns with the school’s mission and the larger principles of its capital campaign. He emphasized the increased financial aid for students, funding for faculty, and the focus on a promising and impactful area of education.
“Part of our overall goal as a school of education is to maximize our impact on the field in a good way, and I think early childhood education is one of the most promising areas for investment,” he said.
Ryan said the Zaentz Foundation, named after the late film producer Saul Zaentz, initially reached out to the GSE after observing a conference on early childhood education led by Lesaux and Jones.
Layton said discussions with the foundation about the gift took place over more than a year after they first indicated interest.
Besides the gift from the Zaentz Foundation, Layton added that the GSE has continued to raise funds over the past year for financial aid, fellowships, and online and professional learning, among other goals.
