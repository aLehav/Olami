After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Just like a new breed of influenza hits us every year with coughs, sneezes and a runny nose, at least one music video goes “viral” around the world, infecting millions. Within weeks, or even days, the video takes over every facet of our lives: it pops up on our Facebook feeds, on the radio, and at parties, and then it replicates in the form of parodies.

The current strain of viral videos may have originated from the “Numa Numa” craze in 2004, when YouTube’s potential was just being realized. Last year’s most potent mutation came in the form of Psy’s "Gangnam Style," which now has almost 1.8 billion views on YouTube. The video’s dance moves were so contagious that even President Obama was caught trying them out. This year’s strain seems to be Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis’s “The Fox.” This bizarre hit about the mysterious furry creature seems to be reminiscent of past viral videos in its wacky dance moves and slick production. 
Is there a formula  for these immensely popular clips? We examined the epidemiology of viral videos and found some telling trends.
 
Electronica
 
Now more than ever, electronica is becoming immensely popular in the music industry. Electronic dance music artists such as David Guetta and Daft Punk have been hugely successful, and artists of other genres, like Kanye West, Rihanna, and Jay-Z, have begun to incorporate EDM-inspired synthesizers and beats into their music. So it comes as no surprise that these viral videos have aspects of electronica as well. Constant pulses of the music, coupled with catchy lyrics, are hallmarks of these videos.
 
Unsexy Dance Moves
 
What separates the choreographed dance moves of “Gangnam Style” and “The Fox” from those of Rihanna? The answer is simple: the dance moves from the first two are not even remotely sexual. Psy’s infamous move quite literally mimics a galloping horse. The dancers in “The Fox” just move around their arms in a zigzag pattern and bop their heads up and down. Sexy? Not so much. But you’ll still see people at parties with all these synchronized dance moves memorized.
 
Silliness 
 
One of the most endearing parts about these videos is that they don’t take themselves too seriously. "Gangnam Style" pokes fun at pretentiousness: at one point in the video, Psy raps in a serious tone in a small space, only for the camera to zoom out and reveal that he’s sitting on a toilet. Meanwhile, “The Fox” is an outright goofy video. Dressed in animal costumes, people attempt to find what sound a fox makes—a light-hearted question that apparently intrigues the world.
 
Ambiguously Satirical
 
However, these videos aren’t just about fun. Behind the ludicrous content of “Gangnam Style” is a subtle jab at current social affairs in Psy’s country. Gangnam is a district in Korea that is widely known as the Upper East Side of Seoul: ritzy and pretentious. By fusing the name Gangnam with a nonsensical narrative, Psy critiques a cultural phenomenon prevalent in Seoul. The duo Ylvis were picked up by high-powered producers Stargate, yet some say they ruined this precious chance to rise in the musical world by creating a song about a fox’s sound. Just like the songs of comedy trio the Lonely Island, “The Fox” uses both silly lyrics and expert production to parody pop music trends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Excitement abounded in Sanders Theatre last Thursday night as hundreds of students, Cambridge residents, and visitors waited to see Wynton Marsalis perform and speak about jazz history. Marsalis is an accomplished, Grammy award-winning trumpeter recognized by the United Nations and the U.S. State Department for his contributions to music and culture. 
 
Accompanied by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Marsalis returned to Harvard for the fifth time on Thursday, continuing his popular and sold-out musical lecture series “Hidden in Plain View: Meanings in American Music.” Each lecture has taken a unique approach to the study of jazz music, highlighting facets of performance like the intersection of music and dance.
 
This time around, in “Setting the Communal Table: The Evolution of Jazz Orchestra,” Marsalis fused his lively accounts of jazz history with the Lincoln Center Orchestra’s renditions of popular music pieces, including those by Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Fletcher Henderson.
 
Following a warm welcome from the crowd, Marsalis dove right into personal stories, including a detailed account of the first time he played a French horn. He also touched on broader themes, including descriptions of how the traditions and hardships of black culture influenced the spread of jazz music. Marsalis explained that the struggles of black Americans shaped the lyrics, style, and popularity of jazz. He also said that ballroom dancing and the social scene of the 1920s encouraged and was encouraged by the jazz music of the age.
 
 "He also hit on a lot of important cultural items too, talking about the historical leadership of jazz musicians in racial desegregation," says Daniel A. Henderson, a lecturer in the department of music specializing in jazz harmony and improvisation.  “I feel like it was billed as a lecture but it was like a lecture/sermon/concert, which is the ultimate learning combination to me."
 
Beyond his anecdotal recounting of the music’s social and cultural history, Marsalis demonstrated the intricacies and histories behind trombones, reeds, and trumpets. As the orchestra played, Marsalis narrated what they were performing, highlighting subtleties and helping the audience appreciate the complexity of all the instruments in the ensemble.  Marsalis asked the orchestra to play different 1920s jazz hits in parts, adding and subtracting instruments to show the effect of each.
 
"He got into serious musical detail which is really exciting for me and for the class,” Henderson says. “He was talking about the evolution of instrumentation and jazz arranging. You hardly ever get to hear someone so in depth about instrumentation and arranging."
 
“Marsalis is not only a world-class musician but also a captivating and engaging speaker,” says Joe L. Choe ’17, a jazz enthusiast and musician. “His message was made that much more effective because he incorporated live music into it. The music added texture to his speech and provided a context for the audience.” According to Choe, “There was never a dry moment, and every time his ensemble played, it was as if the audience was taken to a different world.”
 
For Abby L. Westover ’17, the show was a chance to learn more about jazz in the 1920s, a musical era in which she is interested. “I've always enjoyed [jazz], but have never been extremely knowledgeable about the different nuances and specific names,” she says.
 
Westover says that the orchestra’s performances and Marsalis’s commentaries were in perfect union. “I was completely floored at the talent and artistry Marsalis and the orchestra exhibited,” she says. “I came out of the show wanting to learn more about jazz and having a much higher appreciation for it.”
 
Cherie Z. Hu ’17, who is currently taking Henderson’s class, Music 153: Jazz Harmony, found ties between the class and the event. “In the past few weeks, we’ve been doing harmonic analysis of basic jazz pieces, which really contributed to my liking of the show,” she says. “Last week in class, we learned about a musical concept called the ‘circle of fifths,’ which says that some of the most famous jazz songs use a similar loop over and over again…. I noticed that a lot of the songs during the concert used the circle of fifths, which I thought was really cool."
 
Hu had previously attended a jazz concert hosted by the same orchestra at Lincoln Center. She says that Thursday night’s show was a lot more engaging due to its format and amount of audience interaction. “My last jazz concert at the Lincoln Center was a really good and I really liked it, but the Marsalis concert went much more in depth and I came out learning a lot more about the background of music rather than just listening to it for a few hours.”
 
In addition to speaking of the history and composition of jazz, Marsalis spoke of each individual’s artistic potential. He discussed how musicians during the early jazz period learned through their music that each person offered a world of possibilities. “There is nothing deeper, or more personal, than interest,” Marsalis said. These encouraging words were received warmly by an admiring and enthusiastic audience.

Space has become one of the most recognizable movie milieus, but most genre conventions are lacking in the new film “Gravity.” There are no titanic explosions, no movement in a vacuum without propulsion, and certainly no extraterrestrials: friendly, malevolent, Jedi or otherwise. When shrapnel, hurtling faster than a speeding bullet, hits human beings, it passes straight through them—there is no mercy in space. In its admirable fidelity to scientific accuracy and the look and feel of 21st-century intergalactic travel—the chunkiness of the space suit, the intricate obsolescence of shuttle controls still on analogue systems from the ’70s, how hypoxia caused by falling oxygen levels robs the mind of its ability to make rational decisions—“Gravity” attains a level of grounded reality that this year’s other sci-fi efforts such as “Pacific Rim” and “Elysium” can only dream of.
This is coupled with a supremely effective use of 3D, possibly representing another important step forward in this medium. The technology can depict not only gorgeous vistas of our home planet but also the yawning abysses of empty space that our heroes, astronauts Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Kowalski (George Clooney), are thrown into when debris from a terminated Russian satellite shreds their transport into ribbons of hurtling projectiles and twisted steel. Stone is sent spinning off into the void, the camera dispassionately watching her fade into another speck against the stars, then suddenly inside her helmet watching helplessly and intimately as the universe rotates and all hope seems lost.
The film’s director, Alfonso Cuarón, is the master of the long tracking shot, and in space he seems to have found a natural element for this most dreamlike of cinematographic techniques. His eye sweeps and glides, pirouetting gracefully in the zero gravity. The movie’s first shot, of Stone repairing the Hubble Space Telescope while Kowalski nonchalantly banters with Mission Control back home, clocks in at a cool 15 minutes. Never before in the movies has filmmaker and film scholar Alexander Mackendrick’s idea of the director’s vision as an “invisible imaginary ubiquitous winged witness” felt more apt. For a movie of such choking tension, of such hurtling momentum, Cuarón’s touch is surprisingly light.
The ride however, is not. From that first, terrifyingly choreographed explosion of shrapnel over their spacecraft, the astronauts and the audience are plunged into a desperate and relentless struggle for survival. Stone and Kowalski must try and make their way to the nearby International Space Station, itself speedily abandoned, in the hope that one of its ancient Soyuz transporters can get them home. At the same time, Stone is dealing with the recent death of her daughter and questions the depth of her desire to return to Earth at all. This somewhat formulaic shading-in of Stone’s character leads to arguably Cuarón’s one misstep, the straying over into sentimentality that also marred the end of his otherwise superlative “Children of Men.” As a result of this decision, Bullock’s dialogue occasionally feels excessive or banal.
Such problems are minor. Stone and Kowalski’s interactions largely seem organic rather than forced, aided by effective performances from both leads, and Bullock achieves a level of empathy we haven’t felt from her in a while. This human edge helps as the film retains its furious pace during the final frames. As oxygen levels drop and fragments of ruined satellites burn up in the atmosphere like asteroids, the film forces the audience to collectively suck in its breath in a way that most conventional blockbusters cannot hope to achieve. In eschewing the childish fantasies of his peers, and by recognizing that the best forms of escapism are grounded in profoundly human realities, Cuarón has directed the most exciting space movie in years.

The familiar image of the postcard, that ultimate cliché of travel souvenirs, habitually aids us in the recollection of objects we have seen, inspected, and left behind. But in the Harvard Monday Gallery’s latest show, “Of Models, Memory, and Imagination,” the postcard itself became a medium for aesthetic scrutiny. The show, which ran Sept. 23. and Sept. 30 at 6-8 Linden Street, was the fifth exhibition put on in the Harvard Monday Gallery, an art space run by undergraduate Visual and Environmental Studies concentrators since its opening in spring 2012. 
Hung along the four walls of the stark, square space was a continuous sequence of postcard-sized photos and bits of text, spaced well apart and presented in pairs. The viewer was thus surrounded by impetuses to recreate and imagine the connection between the text that prompted the photos and the photos themselves. Here was art not as destination, but rather as prompt for mental travel: these postcard art objects, though fixed in a neat sequence, by their suggestive and incomplete natures inspired acts of imagination and memory on the part of the viewer. Postcards were even available to be taken home from the show. “An emotion or essence can be derived from it, but not the whole story is there,” says Ashleigh J. Cote ’15, a VES concentrator whose work is featured in the show.
To prepare for the show, five students, including the Gallery’s principal curator Daniel R. Bredar ’14, spent just over a week quickly setting up the event with the help of VES faculty. The origins of this show date, however, from a week and a half this spring when VES visiting artist Alexandra Leykauf (from whom the name of the exhibition originally comes) gave the students a workshop on model-building. She asked each student to pick a text or story he or she liked and to build a three-dimensional model from his or her imagined conception of the architectural interiority of the text. 
The exhibition developed as a by-product of the workshop. Originally, students just took photographs of the models they made to document their process and final products, but at some point they had the idea to make further artistic use of their work from the workshop. “Once we had all these postcards, it was just [a matter of] how best to display them to the public,” Cote says. “We ultimately decided that the kind of linear movement around the room would almost have a narrative sense to it, and given that they were based on texts, that just seemed very natural.” The result is a display of the process of art creation as art in itself, to be seen and contemplated as a documented succession.
 
Adrian Arteaga ’14, who came with his roommate to see the exhibition on its opening night, had a mixed reaction to the event. “I found some of the art hard to understand,” Arteaga says. For his taste, he says, some of the image-text pairings were challengingly abstract.
Cote was not insensible to this concern. “I have a lot of memories of making the model, so to see the photos has a lot of symbolic meaning to me,” she says. “But a lot of the pictures are very vague, and it’s uncertain how they relate to the text. [This] is fine, but sometimes that can [make it difficult for] the spectator.” On the other hand, Cote notes that this ambiguity in perceived meaning is an aspect built into the very act of viewing creations like this. “These postcards offer a glimpse of the models and also a glimpse of the text which the models were constructed from,” she says. “It has the nature of a memory, where it’s a vagueness or not a clear picture.” 
Whether overly abstract or an inspiring manifestation of memory, the work that the Harvard Monday Gallery displays has the advantage of an inherent relatability for Harvard students—both the artists and the attendees are all, or nearly all, Harvard College students. “I enjoyed seeing many friendly faces,” Artega says.
 
The exhibition’s play between object, word, and image was extended to music as well: on the opening night of the gallery, Harvard undergraduate band L.A. Jeff played original music and ambient sounds on the small courtyard outside the gallery as students viewed the work of friends and classmates.

“Yellow Moon,” the story of two teenage outcasts who fall in love, opens with murder. Lee (Eli W. Pelton ’16) kills his abusive stepfather with a knife in the midst of a passionate brawl. Leila (Juliana N. Sass ’17) witnesses the murder and together, she and Lee run away to the north Highlands of Scotland.
Premiering on Thursday in the Loeb Ex, this modern-day “Bonnie and Clyde” explores both the positive and negative parts of human relationships.
“Leila desperately wants to be part of a story,” Sass says. “Even though she is horrified by the fact that [Lee] murdered someone, she is fascinated by the fact that she’s part of a journey. Because of that, she goes with him.”
Written by Scottish playwright David Greig, the play sets up its two main characters as opposites. Acquaintances in a small town, Leila is nicknamed “Silent Leila” because she never speaks, and Lee is a well known extrovert. However, as their journey together develops, their initial impressions of each other change. “We come to see that his extroversion is a bit of a front in the same way that her silence is,” Sass says.
Alternating between dialogue and narration by each character, the show features more and more dialogue as it continues. Sass also says that this particular structure signifies the increasing lack of control the characters have over the story as they get to know each other better.
“They are all very real characters that have a lot of wonderful things about them and a lot of great flaws,” director Susanna B. Wolk ’14 says. “I think it’s about how we fall in love with people’s flaws.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, the Harvard community says goodbye to student ally and support system in Sarah Rankin, director of Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. As of Monday, Rankin has moved to hold the position of Title IX Investigator at MIT. With her departure, administrators are beginning to look for a new director who can fill Rankin’s shoes. We hope that this new director will build on all the crucial, outstanding work Rankin has contributed to OSAPR. We also hope this new director pushes more strongly for sexual assault policy change, which has received widespread support from the student community but has yet to be implemented by the University.
While in office, Rankin made some critical contributions and changes to OSAPR. To name a few, she created Consent, Assault Awareness, and Relationship Educators to give students an avenue to become involved in sexual assault prevention—as peer educators—in a meaningful way. She expanded victim services to the entire Harvard student community, making resources available for College and graduate school students. She revived Harvard Men Against Rape and helped the group gain visibility on campus.  She expanded the scope of victim services, including free legal counsel. With the help of OSAPR prevention specialists, she also institutionalized bystander education trainings for many student groups. Crucially, these include final clubs: Last year, OSAPR trained all but two of the final clubs.
Rankin has left a strong foundation for successors to build upon. We hope the new director will, like Rankin, continually seek student input and think of innovative ways (like reaching out to final clubs) to impact the student body, and in particular to think about ways in which Harvard can improve the accessibility of its sexual assault resources to students from diverse backgrounds.
It is also our hope that the new director focus intensely on advocating for sexual assault policy change. Our Harvard Can Do Better a student campaign for sexual assault policy reform received overwhelming support for its policy demands in a student referendum last year. Among those demands are a policy of affirmative consent, clarifying the meaning of mental incapacitation, and offering comprehensive and inclusive sexual assault prevention and response training every year. The group also calls for more transparency in the administration and for clearer language that includes the LGBTQ-identifying community. These commonsense reforms have been implemented at a number of peer colleges, and they will go a long way toward creating safe social environments.
A standard of affirmative consent in particular is a change that would be critical in helping students to have more power in prosecuting assailants and in creating cultural change on campus. Despite the successes of the Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign, students have thus far lacked a strong ally in OSAPR who is willing to push for their demands. We hope that OSAPR’s new director can become that ally, and that he or she does not shy away from advocating for reform to administrators.
We salute the outstanding work that Sarah Rankin has accomplished in her seven years as OSAPR director. With a greater focus on policy reform, OSAPR can become an even stronger ally for sexual assault survivors and students working to effect change.

“You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” –Steve Jobs, Stanford Commencement Address, 2005
Three days after graduation, Daniel M. Pallotta ’83 flew to Seattle with 38 of his Harvard classmates. He spent the next nine-and-a-half weeks returning to where he started, guiding his classmates on a bike ride across America.
His post-grad plans were months in the organizing. While some seniors dressed in suits and rushed to recruiting interviews, Pallotta and his friend Mark A. Takano ’83 spent their senior fall bumbling around House dining halls, asking every senior they encountered to join them on a cross-country bike ride after graduation. Pallotta and Takano contacted churches, synagogues, and rotary clubs across the country requesting hospitality during their journey, and it worked. The result: a crazy cross-country route peppered with free accommodations and meals, and $80,000 raised for Oxfam-America over the course of the trip.
The summer was inspiring and energizing, but Pallotta returned feeling like he needed to get a real job. “Now you need to go into the real world and suffer just like everyone else,” he remembers telling himself, the voice of convention bubbling through his thoughts. Pallotta took a job in the Massachusetts State House, where he sat around “pretending [he] was working” for seven months, until he couldn’t take it anymore and left. He moved to Los Angeles to become a singer-songwriter.
A few things happened in LA: Pallotta attempted to channel his political views into song but realized he was no Bob Dylan, the AIDS epidemic broke out, and he enrolled in business school at UCLA on his father’s request, only to realize that it wasn’t for him. He withdrew before classes even started.
“I think being gay has influenced my career choices a lot,” Pallotta says, reflecting on his risky move to pursue music in LA. “[Being gay], you learn not to be dishonest with yourself. Then you start to say, ‘Why would I be dishonest with myself in any of the other areas of my life?’”
Yet still, after seven years of writing songs and performing in coffeehouses, Pallotta felt that the music he loved was not his calling.  “The universe [was] inviting me to do something other than what I stubbornly wanted to do,” he recalls.
Pallotta had been daydreaming of another bike ride, this one a 600-mile route down the California coast from San Francisco to Los Angeles.  He brought this idea to the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Community Services Center, which was looking for a new signature event, and the center agreed to give Pallotta’s idea a try.  The first AIDSRide happened that year in 1994 and its 487 participants netted $1,013,000 for AIDS—far more than expected.
Before the first AIDSRide, Pallotta had believed that there was “nothing big” the average person could do for AIDS. But now he saw things differently: His passion of planning long bike trips had amounted to a new kind of fundraising, one that was lucrative, and that he was uniquely qualified to orchestrate.
“Service is not doing something for nothing or suffering economically or not being paid,” says Pallotta. “It’s really having the humility to respond to what life seems to be asking you to do, and to respond to what seems to be your natural calling.”
Pallotta saw that the fundraising method he devised for the first AIDSRide could be replicated, and he started applying his planning talents to other events. He first expanded the AIDSRides to Boston, New York, Chicago, Washington D.C., and other major cities. Then he expanded his scope, spearheading the Breast Cancer 3-Day walks, the Out of Darkness Suicide Prevention walks, and the largest ever cross-country bike trip in which 730 people biked from Seattle to Washington D.C. to benefit the American Lung Association.
Whereas “thon” fundraising events existed before he started working on them, Pallotta was the first person to require a four-figure mandatory fundraising minimum for participation and to market the events widely using major media.  Doing so made his initiatives wildly successful; the model raised over $582 million for various causes over the course of his career.
It wasn’t all smooth sailing along the way.  Pallotta’s fund-raising company Pallotta TeamWorks failed very suddenly in 2002, leaving his finances precarious.  Even before he had his own company, his income had been unsteady. “It’s a frightening way to live and still is for me,” Pallotta confesses. “I have three kids. I have to support them, and my economic life has always been very entrepreneurial.” “
“You don’t always know where money will come from,” he pauses. “It’s not for the faint of heart, but it’s a wonderful journey.”
Flinging out his fingertips to trace the holes on the surface of the picnic table, Pallotta chuckles at the irony: the table top is composed of disconnected dots.  He mentions his friend Herb who always told him that the trouble of life is that it can only be understood backwards but has to be lived forwards. He references Steve Jobs’s famous quote from Stanford commencement—the one about the dots.
“You meet your times and the circumstances and it all comes together,” says Pallotta. “You just have to be open to it being that kind of journey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Very few economists enjoyed decades of anonymity followed by decades of recognition. Ronald Coase is one of them. Coase’s career trajectory is a reflection of his revolutionary ideas and academic longevity. He conceived the idea behind his first magnum opus, The Nature of the Firm, at the age of 21 in 1931. In February 2013, just seven months before he passed away last month, he finished a book on capitalist China.
In The Nature of The Firm, Coase mulled over the raison d’etre of firms in an economy. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described a free-market economy where the butcher and the baker supplied dinners with no coordination but guidance from an “invisible hand.” However, even in Smith’s time, the economy was not made up of such free-acting butchers and bakers, but firms that externally competed in the free market while internally maintaining an authoritarian grip using direct command. Smith did not ask why such voluntary dictatorship exists. Karl Marx answered that it is an apparatus of evil. To answer Smith and to refute Marx, Coase argued that transaction cost, the cost of trading in the free-market, could explain why firms exist and how large they are. Although the price mechanism in the free market generally allocates resources efficiently, it is quite expensive to use. When a car company has to look for tire suppliers, for example, it has to negotiate contracts and ensure that the tires arrive timely. When the car company decides that these contracts are too costly and time-consuming, it may choose to make its own tires. Firms will grow larger as such vertical integration occurs, until the organization cost of managing multiple processes outweighs the cost of using price mechanism.
In the next decades to come, Coase’s theory of transaction cost would provide several key insights about market institutions and behaviors. Throughout his career, Coase was keen on making such empirical observations about markets and institutions. He vehemently opposed doing “blackboard economics,” the offering up of beautiful theorems that could not be observed in real life, which had became popular in some circles.
It is quite ironic, then, that he is the namesake of the widely celebrated Coase Theorem, which he admits to be impossible in the real world. Coase illustrates the theorem through the example of a farmer and cattle raiser whose livestock trample the farm. While it seems to be in the public interest to forbid the cattle raiser to raise livestock near the farm, Coase points out that the negative economic damage is reciprocal. The same regulation that protects the farmer will hurt the cattle raiser’s livelihood. In cases when the cattle raiser’s benefit from raising livestock is greater than the farmer’s benefit from using the farm, it is economically inefficient to regulate the cattle raiser. Alternatively, if the government grants the farmer the right to farm without interference from livestock but allows him to sell this right, the farmer and the cattle raiser can always come to an efficient settlement that is mutually beneficial.
Coase believed the result to be completely intuitive at a time when no one else thought so. He presented this result at a dinner with a group of Chicago economists, including several other Nobel laureates-to-be. Initially, the table was one against 20 in favor of the result. At the end of the dinner, all were satisfied by the brilliance of his argument.
Coase published this result in The Problem of Social Cost, which invited profound policy implications. In a world without transaction cost and where every economic action is delimited as somebody’s right, there is no need for regulation. Laws and rights are not important for efficiency, either; every delimitation of rights leads to the same efficient outcome. The Coase Theorem predicts an anarchist utopia.
Coase does not agree with the universal appeal of his theorem. His illustration of an economy free of transaction costs is merely a mental exercise that demonstrates a more nuanced view—that since both government regulations and market solutions are inefficient, we must compare the two to choose the lesser of evils. In the case when both solutions are more costly than the market failure at hand, it may be wise to pursue neither. Nonetheless, the economics profession at the time widely believed that market failures are best solved via taxation, following Arthur Pigou’s tradition, and Coase was described casually at a cocktail party as holding views right of the John Birch Society.
Coase’s papers were initially met with negligence and opposition. And just like the dinner table debate, in decades to come, the world started to appreciate Coase’s deep insights. The Nature of the Firm and The Problem of Social Cost, written 30 years apart, are the most and second most cited papers in the history of economics. These two papers created or irreversibly changed the subfields of organizational economics, new institutional economics, and law and economics. For these contributions, Coase won the Nobel Prize in Economics, in 1991. In his Nobel Prize speech, he remarked that an economist “can count on ultimately seeing [his work] accepted, if only he lives long enough.” It is a great fortune to both Coase and economics that the economics profession fully embraced his contributions in his lifetime.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Senator Edward J. Markey’s swearing in as the junior senator from Massachusetts, prospective candidates began jockeying to represent his old district in the House of Representatives. That district—the Massachusetts Fifth—includes Harvard and Cambridge, and stands among the most consistently Democratic districts in the country. It is therefore very likely that whoever wins the October 15 Democratic primary will become the district’s next Congressperson. In a race among largely progressive Democrats, one issue has come to the forefront—campaign finance reform.
In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled on Citizens United, a case in which it held that independent political spending by corporations (and other organizations) constitutes an exercise of free speech under the First Amendment, and therefore cannot be limited. In 2012, the Massachusetts Senate, outraged by the Court’s decision, approved a resolution imploring Congress to overrule Citizens United with a constitutional amendment. Of the five Democratic candidates for Congress in the Massachusetts Fifth, four support the measure. Only State Senator Will Brownsberger of Belmont opposes the resolution.
Senator Brownsberger’s position puts him at odds with his political competitors. At a recent candidates’ forum in Arlington, several candidates emphasized their opposition to Citizens United and equated that position with their progressive credentials. On Blue Mass Group—a prominent Massachusetts political blog—several commentators have cast Senator Brownsberger’s nay vote as a treachery to progressive values, a sign of ambivalence to campaign finance reform.
But Senator Brownsberger’s position is actually far more nuanced than that, and rests on his understanding that the resolution in question, rather than simply asserting the ill effects of corporate influence in politics or suggesting that the Court has ruled incorrectly, actually calls for a constitutional amendment.
Limiting corruption in politics is an issue of utmost importance, but a constitutional amendment is an ill-advised solution. Because the Court’s decision was grounded in the First Amendment’s free speech clause, any amendment to overturn Citizens United would have to revolve around a redefinition of “speech” allowing limitations on a corporation’s ability to buy airspace or other media. Money, of course, is not speech—and as such, it is perfectly fine that we limit how much money an organization can give directly to a candidate. But when that money is used to create or disseminate a form of political speech—such as an advocacy ad—I don’t see how the government can limit it. Yet such a limitation is exactly the aim of the resolution that Senator Brownsberger opposes.
Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis once said that sunlight is the “best of disinfectants,” and that sentiment still rings true today. Transparency is the key to victory in the battle over campaign finance reform. We can mitigate the influence of big money in our political system without barring certain kinds of organizations from presenting their message to the voters.
Whenever a corporation, organization, or even an individual funds political speech (such as a political ad), that information should be made clear to the public. Any group that spends money for political purposes should be required to release the sources of its funding, just as actual candidates must release their finances. Political action committees should be required to present themselves in such a way that voters can easily discern their purpose, and candidates should be required to release any questionnaires they complete when courting the support of organizations. Steps such as these would create tangible reform without redefining or limiting speech.
Senator Brownsberger exemplifies these ideas more so than do any of his opponents. In the Legislature, he co-sponsored a bill (with fellow candidate Carl Sciortino of Medford) making disclosure laws more stringent for political action committees, and he is currently the only candidate who has released every questionnaire he has filled out for an organization—the answers and promises made by his opponents remain unknown to the voters.
Senator Brownsberger also stands alone in his refusal to accept campaign donations from corporations, unions, and political action committees. While railing against the undue influence of such organizations in the political process, the other candidates seem perfectly comfortable accepting their money.
Campaign finance reform is vital for creating a more open and democratic political system, but a constitutional amendment limiting the ability to produce and disseminate speech is simply not the answer. Senator Brownsberger is an example of thoughtful, transparent, and ethical politics, and his opposition to a largely symbolic resolution does nothing to change that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins store at the corner of Mass. Ave and Bow Street will continue serving customers after its lease was renegotiated last week, the length of its tenure in Harvard Square remains unclear.
“We were fully prepared to close on September 26…[T]hat Dunkin’ Donuts at 1 Bow St. has renegotiated its terms with the property management company and will be staying open until further notice,” wrote franchise owner David G. Carvalho in an email to The Crimson. Carvalho operates all four Dunkin’ Donuts locations in Harvard Square.
But the retail space still appears to be available for lease, according to the properties listed on the website of Crosspoint Associates—a real estate management company headquartered in Waltham, Mass., that oversees the property where the eateries are located.
The Coop president Jeremiah P. Murphy, Jr. ’73 whose company owns the property at 1 Bow St., said he believes the agreement between Carvalho and the real estate management company on the lease may not be long-term.
“I believe the two parties came to a short-term agreement to cover the time needed for firming up a new tenant,” Murphy wrote in an email to The Crimson. “This would be in the best interests of everybody if there was an operating business in the space until a new tenant takes over, instead of an empty storefront.”
Realtors from Colliers International, who are selling the lease, and a public relations representative for the Dunkin’ Donuts franchise under RF|Binder declined to comment.
Carvalho declined to disclose further information on the lease. “We look forward to continuing to keep guests at this location running on Dunkin’,” he wrote.
From the moment that signs were posted on Sept. 17 announcing the location’s closing until their removal on Sept. 24, the loss of the iconic coffee and ice cream shop became a subject of student and community interest.
The storefront claims a particular prestige after being featured in the film “Good Will Hunting.” Matt Damon could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School administrators announced their decision to decrease the number of custodial jobs slated to be cut later this year during a meeting on Tuesday with members of the Service Employees International Union 32BJ District 615.
In June, the Medical School notified American Cleaning Company, Inc., a subcontractor that employs custodial workers represented by SEIU, that their six-and-a-half-year-old contract would be annulled. The decision would have resulted in roughly 30,000 hours of custodial work being cut.
However, Richard M. Shea, the Medical School’s associate dean for campus planning and facilities, said in a phone interview on Thursday afternoon that the school made the decision to cut roughly 11,000 hours instead of the 30,000 they had originally proposed. Shea said the decision occurred after incorporating the perspectives of Medical School affiliates into a reassessment of the initial plan.
"We just felt that there were some things we didn’t feel it was reasonable to cut," Shea said.
Shea also cited the Medical School’s financial troubles as the main reason for the custodial cuts. The school experienced a nearly $29 million deficit in the 2012 fiscal year, according to the Boston Globe.
He said that the custodial cuts are only one of several measures the school is pursuing to balance the budget. He also mentioned the recent launch of HMS Next, an initiative focused on finding ways to rethink and restructure the current operating model, as another strategy being used to ensure the school’s future financial sustainability.
"A lot of things we’re doing are small things," Shea said. "It’s like turning around an aircraft carrier [in that] there are a lot of things that need to make that happen."
In spite of the Medical School’s announcement, Union associates present at the meeting on Tuesday—characterized by both sides as an impact bargaining session that is standard operating procedure for any changes in workers’ contracts—expressed their continued dissatisfaction with any level of cuts.
"There’s not going to be anyone who’s happy knowing that there are people who are going to lose their jobs," Fredesvinda Coto, an American Cleaning Company employee at the Medical School, said through a translator during a phone interview on Thursday afternoon.
Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for 32BJ District 615, said that the roughly $400,000 projected in savings—a number presented by the Medical School at the meeting on Tuesday—does not justify even the reduced cuts.
"It’s really chump change in the grand scheme of things," Langley said.
SEIU also held a protest against the cuts Wednesday afternoon consisting of about 40 students and employees at the Medical School, according to Langley.

Following the debut of the Affordable Care Act’s health exchanges on Oct. 1, Harvard academics in health economics and public policy suggest that the Act’s role in the government shutdown on Tuesday might affect the way the public views the reform plan.
 
“The ACA is the law which will dramatically expand the ability of most American citizens and legal immigrants to obtain affordable and quality health insurance coverage,” said John E. McDonough, who worked on the writing and passage of the health law in the United States Senate from 2008 to 2010 and is now director at the Harvard School of Public Health’s Center for Public Health Leadership. “The Republicans in Congress are attempting to use the non-funding of the government to gain political leverage in trying to defund or stop implementation of the law.”
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law by President Obama in March 2010 and includes Medicare expansion in some states and nationwide insurance exchanges—online marketplaces where individuals can browse, compare, and buy health insurance plans. Under the Act, individuals are required to buy health insurance by Jan. 1, 2014, or pay a tax for non-compliance.
 
Benjamin D. Sommers, assistant professor of health policy and economics at the School of Public Health, took leave from Harvard in 2011 and 2012 to evaluate the efficacy of the health care program at the Department of Health and Human Services. He called the online marketplaces “an Expedia or Kayak for health insurance,” and cautioned against letting policy and politics too heavily shape their future.
 
“What I would hope as both an academic and just as an American citizen is that we could get this out of the realm of the purely political,” said Sommers. “Right now it’s pure political theater.”
 
The exchanges were launched on Oct. 1 despite Republican protestation. Glitches due to immense site traffic marked the debut of state and federal-run marketplaces.
 
“I think it is not surprising that there are early logistical glitches in the ability of people to get information about health insurance exchanges and to sign up through these portals given the complexity of insurance offerings and the mechanics of figuring out subsidies,” said Katherine Baicker, professor of health economics at the School of Public Health. “I certainly hope that those will be ironed out sooner rather than later because it is important that people get accurate information and are able to make informed decisions about the plans that are available to them.”
 
Though preliminary statistics about enrollment have already been released, some academics have suggested that it is too early to understand their long-term implications. In fact, future decision-making on health care will be largely driven by public opinion, according to Robert J. Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the School of Public Health.
 
“As we’re shifting from a public policy debate, what is going to change opinion is not something the President says or the government says,” he said. “A year from now, it becomes like buying a consumer product: it’s real, it’s on the market, your neighbor will have enrolled, will have tried, and will have used the card. People’s opinions are not going to be shaped by some general view, but by what actually happens and what they see and hear from these plans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
At a town hall meeting Thursday evening, HarvardX Faculty Director Robert A. Lue and fellow faculty members addressed how the 16-month-old online learning platform must continue to adapt pedagogically, financially, and structurally to reach its goals—expanding access, improving teaching, and advancing research.
 HarvardX is the University’s component of the edX platform, an online learning venture which brings together universities from around the world to create online courses for a global audience. Over the past year, HarvardX launched edX’s first humanities course and intends to add an additional 15 new courses over the next few months, according to Lue.
 
But faculty have identified a number of areas of improvement.
 
“High-quality pedagogy is lacking in MOOCs,” said Graduate School of Education associate professor Meira Levinson during a speech at the meeting, in reference to the massive open online courses which HarvardX offers. To help remedy this problem, Levinson said she will use data collected from an urban education course that she is bringing to edX this fall to gauge the effectiveness of using case studies in an online environment.
 
This capacity for experimentation is HarvardX’s best aspect, said David Sliski, a curatorial assistant at the Harvard Observatory who attended the town hall, which is this year’s first. 
“There is an exponential increase in the development of teaching strategies because of the large audience a single course can reach, a kind of evaluation that has never been possible before,” he said.
 
Addressing questions about the platform’s financial viability, Lue said that it is “likely that philanthropy won’t allow HarvardX to go forward forever.”
He added that HarvardX might look to licences for governments and businesses that will be using the platform’s resources as possible sources of revenue, in addition to the ID-verified completion certificates that edX President Anant Agarwal recently announced.
 
In an interview with The Crimson following the meeting, Lue also acknowledged the low retention rates reported by MOOCs, calling them “largely misinterpreted.” He said that it is important to remember that many enrollees never intend to finish the course but instead only complete certain modules of the program. “It might be beneficial for those seeking to complete the course to be in a separate forum,” Lue added.
 
Lue also emphasized that the platform is meant as much for students at Harvard as it is for those elsewhere. 
“HarvardX is our institutional commitment to harnessing the Internet to support amazing gains in learning, for people outside campus, but, as importantly, for students on campus,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part I of a five-part series on Cambridge City Council election issues. Read each installment on the Fridays leading up to the Nov. 5 election. Part II ran on Oct. 11 and Part III ran on Oct. 18.
When Cambridge City Council candidate Mushtaque Mirza was traveling in New Zealand, people were puzzled when he said his hometown—Cambridge, Mass. The confusion quickly cleared when he told them that Cambridge was also the home of Harvard University.
“I said ‘Have you heard about Harvard?’ and they said ‘Yes, yes, yes’,” Mirza told The Crimson. “Everybody knows Harvard.”
Mirza is now vying with 24 other candidates for the opportunity to serve Cambridge as one of its nine city councillors—a contest that will be decided on Nov. 5.
Each of the candidates is looking to negotiate town and gown relations in a city that is said to be best-known for its universities. From questions such as ‘Where does Cambridge stop and Harvard start?’ and ‘How have relationships between the city and universities developed over the years?’ to  ‘Where do students fit into the mix?’, the relationship between Cambridge and Harvard is a pivotal element of candidate philosophy.
“There wouldn’t really be a Cambridge if Harvard hadn’t founded their college here...Our histories are intertwined and that one would not be successful without the other,” said current City Councillor and candidate Leland Cheung.
Harvard was founded in 1636—the same year Cambridge became an official city. Over nearly four centuries, the city has become a liberal enclave that houses several universities, a broad and prosperous tax base, and a growing population.
As was inevitable, a relationship has developed between Harvard and Cambridge, but that partnership has been rife with tensions over matters ranging from construction to taxpaying to the thousands of undergraduates and workers on the Harvard campus.
“Like it or not, people can live here 100 years, but no one will have been here longer than Harvard. Like it or not, Cambridge is defined by its universities. To not embrace that is to the detriment to both Harvard and the town...Cambridge is because of Harvard,” said Logan E. Leslie ’16, who is running for a seat on the Council.
With five weeks left until election day, each of the candidates is presenting a solution for navigating the town and gown divide, and many of these visions involve using students as the bridge between city and university.
THE ANTI-HARVARD CAMPAIGN
Of all the institutions of higher learning in the city, MIT—not Harvard—has dominated Council discussions in the past two years, according to councillors and candidates.
As Harvard has worked to finalize the development plan in Allston, the focus of the University’s community outreach efforts have shifted accordingly from Cambridge to Allston, across the river. MIT’s dealings with the Cambridge community, meanwhile, have increased, with leaders including MIT President L. Rafael Reif coming before the Council in the past year to negotiate necessary zoning changes for development in Kendall Square.
But Harvard still remains a contested character in the Cambridge political scene, according to several City Council candidates.
“It is good politics to say whatever you want to say if it’s against Harvard,” said Leslie, who added that he is running to advocate for the University. “There are a lot of people—most of them uninformed—who will go to the polls and vote a vote if they think it’s anti-Harvard.”
Cheung, who is a graduate of a dual degree program between the Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management, described Cambridge’s town and gown divide as an unfortunate byproduct of university-driven economic development.
“Having Harvard and MIT, Cambridge’s challenge is almost, ‘How do we deal with too much of a good thing?’” Cheung said.
As Cheung described, Harvard and MIT have led to the growth of companies and job opportunities in Cambridge. But this economic growth has been followed by an influx of people to Cambridge, pressure on the housing market, and the displacement of long-time Cambridge residents.
Leslie also noted the link between Cantabrigians’ resentment of Harvard and their fear of further changes in the city landscape. “[Cantabrigians] say things like, ‘Let’s keep them from changing the character of the city,’” Leslie said.
TAKING CAMBRIDGE FOR GRANTED?
Asked to characterize Harvard’s relationship with city government in the last two years, candidates gave conflicting responses.
Citing Harvard and MIT’s new sustainability agreement with Cambridge, Kristen von Hoffman and Jefferson R. Smith both described the relationship as strong. Cheung, who served on the City Council’s University Relations Committee during his first term, said the relationship has “improved,” but Leslie called it “strained.”
“I don’t think there has ever been a relationship,” said Craig A. Kelley, a current city councillor who is seeking reelection.
Kelley said that the Council has failed to communicate with the University in a focused manner and that the University, meanwhile, has independently pursued its own plans in the city. He cited the renovations of Leverett and Dunster House as examples of how Harvard has pursued projects that affect the Cantabrigians’ daily lives with limited input from city stakeholders.
“So when Harvard does its houses down by Cowperthwaite Street...it has traffic impacts, parking impacts, noise impacts,” Kelley said. “When it decides it wants to do something on the overpass by the Science Center it is a big something...when you do something, you have impacts.”
Whether or not Harvard does right by the community was a point of contention amongst Council candidates.
“They’re great landlords if you speak to people who do business in Harvard Square,” said Leslie, adding that he believed Harvard maintains its rental properties well in hopes of sustaining tourism to the University.
Cheung, however, focused on the University’s recent decline in philanthropy on the local level. He discussed the closure of the Inn at Harvard and sale of a building on 2 Mt. Auburn St. that had previously been rented to a nonprofit dedicated to affordable housing.
“When Harvard put the hotel [on Mass Ave.] , they made it clear that it was eventually going to be swing housing space for some reconstruction, but that still doesn’t mean that the people there, working there for 10 years, aren’t negatively impacted,” Cheung said.
He explained that the property, Putnam Square Apartments, was a commitment by Harvard to provide housing to low-income senior citizens. “By selling that off to another organization Harvard is backing away from their prior commitment,” Cheung said.
Harvard receives basic services, including water, fire protection, and public safety services, from the City of Cambridge. But, to the dismay of certain Council candidates, Harvard does not pay official taxes on its academic buildings.
Instead, the University contributes money to the City in the form of annual voluntary payments. According to the City of Cambridge’s 2012 Town Gown report, these payments amounted to $2,783,151 in 2012—an amount some of the candidates think is too low.
 
Cheung and candidate James M. Williamson both suggested that Harvard should give back more to the Cambridge community.
“As a tax-exempt institution, what obligations do they have to the community?” Williamson asked. “Are the current PILOT payments enough? Can Harvard be a collaborator in Cambridge schools? They have done a lot, but that relationship could be better.”
BRIDGING THE GAP WITH STUDENTS
The interviewed Council candidates universally advocated for greater involvement of university students in Cambridge politics and the community. Historically, however, students in the area have expressed little interest in local politics.
“It’s hard to bring students into the resident life, the civic life, of the regular Cambridge population,” said Minka Y. vanBeuzekom, a current councillor who is seeking reelection. 
Candidate Janekke Ann House attributed the lack of engagement to the mundane topics that the Council must at times address.
“Nobody wants to talk about potholes and swingsets,” House said. “But it’s the local issues that affect the students most.”
Many of the current councillors and candidates offered ideas about how Cambridge could better serve students’ needs. 
VanBeuzekom said she hoped to introduce a plan that would better integrate the Harvard University Libraries with the Cambridge Public Library. House expressed a desire to reinstall the “night owl bus,” a transportation service which previously ran a shuttle service for residents after the T closed.
And Cheung said he hoped to implement an orientation program for how to bike in the city, through which students could go on bike rides with police officers who would teach them about safe practices.
Many candidates also proposed involving students in city planning.
“Something that I’d love to do is to hold a forum for university students...and to have us talk about what our goals are for the City of Cambridge,” said von Hoffman. “And after that just engage students...open up a dialogue and from there try to have some sort of projects, seminars, task forces.”
Leslie outlined a plan to set up an advisory committee of students from Harvard, MIT, Lesley, and Cambridge College.
“Students are the bridge,” von Hoffman said. “They bring the vibrancy and energy that ties the city government to the school administration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in two years, the Harvard football team will head into week three of the season protecting an undefeated record. The streak will be tested against Holy Cross this Saturday as the Crimson (2-0) will travel to Worchester to take on the Crusaders (2-3) in the 67th meeting of the two programs.
Harvard enters the contest with a three game losing streak at Fitton Field and looks to end that drought in Saturday’s match up.
Although last year’s game was a blow out, seeing Harvard take the victory by a score of 52-3, Crimson coach Tim Murphy does not plan to take this year’s meeting lightly.
“[Winning the game] is going to be really hard,” Murphy said. “They will be, as the players like to say, ’geeked up to play.’ It’s homecoming, they are coming off a big win, they found a great young freshman quarterback, and they have been eating crow for a year over that last game.”
Holy Cross’s 31-28 upset over Dartmouth last weekend emphasized the fact that the Patriot League foe is not to be taken lightly. With 525 yards of total offense, 290 of them coming from the arm of freshman quarterback Peter Pujals, the Crusaders offense proved that it is a force to be reckoned with for Ivy League opponents. Since being called upon to take the majority of the snaps for the Crusaders, Pujals has a combined 419 passing yards, four touchdowns, one interception and completed 66 percent of his passes.
“[Pujals] has given the team a lot of momentum and a lot of swag,” Murphy said. “They really believe in this kid, and for a freshman quarterback to be able to have that much leadership impact and that much production impact is really impressive.”
Despite the fact that the Crusaders offense has improved immensely over the last year, the defensive strategy for this Saturday’s contest has not been significantly changed.
“Something that we have always tried to do is get turnovers, try to win three downs, and get our offense on the field,” said junior defensive end Zach Hodges. “It’s just doing the little things. If we do the little things everything else will work out.”
“They run a lot of option type things and therefore you have to be very assignment oriented,” added Murphy. “It’s not just about an attack type of defense because it’s hard to pressure.”
Last week, although the Crimson allowed Brown to rack up 427 yards of total offense, the Harvard defense shut the door in the second half as the team cruised to a 41-23 victory. Harvard stayed true to its emphasis of forcing turnovers by pressuring Bears quarterback Patrick Donnelly to throw three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown by senior defensive back Jaron Wilson. The defense also forced two fumbles, recovering one of them.
On the offensive side of the ball for Crimson, junior quarterback Conner Hempel continued to prove that he belongs in the starting spot with 269 passing yards in the win against Brown after being called upon to take leadership of the offense this season.
“I think everything that I have been working on over the off season [will help us win]: getting us in the right place, making sure I know the different protection checks, checking in and out of run plays,” Hempel said.
To maintain its undefeated record, the Crimson will need to come out of the gates eager to score, as the team fell behind Brown 13-0 in the first quarter of last weekend’s game. In the opening game of the year against San Diego, Harvard struggled to put points on the board early, scoring 21 of its 42 points in the fourth quarter.
“We clearly have played better in the second quarter. Thankfully we have been a very good finishing team thus far,” Murphy said.
Harvard’s offense will face additional adversity in its running game as the team will try to fill the void left by sophomore running back Zach Boden, who exited last weekend’s game with a knee injury and was replaced by sophomore Andrew Casten. While sophomore Paul Stanton took on the majority of the workload and scored two touchdowns, Casten finished the game with 45 yards rushing on just eight carries.
“Zach’s a proven commodity who is clearly going to be out for a while but Paul has more than picked up the slack.... He’s a multi-dimensional kid who has speed, can be a good inside physical runner, and can do a good job in the pass game,” Murphy said.
Above all, Harvard is going into the game prepared to go all in for every point.
“We’ve worked hard and we’re training hard trying to build off of the momentum we’ve gotten from the past two weeks,” Hodges said. “We like a fight so we’ll take it any way we can get it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not be “The Game,” but it’s certainly a big one for the Harvard men’s soccer team.
The Crimson (1-5-2) opens Ivy League play this Saturday evening against archrival Yale (1-6) at Reese Stadium in New Haven. Both teams have struggled thus far with only one win each, and a victory this weekend could create a momentum shift for either squad.
In their 2012 conference opener, neither team could find the back of the net as the game ended in a 0-0 tie after two overtime periods.  Harvard controlled the second half of the contest, but it was not enough to get past an impenetrable Bulldogs defensive front.
Despite last year’s tie, the Crimson leads the historic rivalry, 51-37-11, since the teams first faced each other in 1907.
“It’s the Harvard-Yale rivalry, so both teams are pretty amped up and excited from the start,” senior defender Ross Friedman said. “It’s been close every year I’ve been a part of it.”
Harvard is coming off a 1-0 loss to St. Francis last weekend where the Crimson defense allowed the decisive goal off a corner kick early in the first half. Despite going down early, Harvard created a number of scoring opportunities they failed to capitalize on.
“Our defense held strong,” senior midfielder Kevin Harrington said. “We just had one slip up… We’ve been in pretty much every single game so far. We couldn’t put away the opportunities we had to win.”
Although the Crimson’s defense has often been able to keep the games close, an inability to finish on the offensive end has put Harvard on the losing end of five of their first seven games.  Out of 93 total shots, only 39 have been on goal, resulting in only six Crimson scores.
“Something we’re working on is connecting passes in the final third and bringing it all together,” Friedman said. “We create so many chances off set pieces, corner kicks, and other opportunities. Our focus is to take it to that next step. We’re looking for some guys to step up and put the ball in the back of the net because we’re doing everything to get up to that point.”
Yale has had a similar experience, struggling offensively while succeeding on defense.  Except for a 3-1 loss to UC Santa Barbara, all of its losses have been within one goal. The Bulldogs’ offense, however, has been unable to score in four of seven games so far in the 2013 season, and only twice has it been able to score more than once in a match.
Of the Ancient Eight, Harvard is last in both goals scored and shooting percentage, while Yale takes a close seventh in the two categories. The Bulldogs are also coming off of a 1-0 nonconference loss to Quinnipiac in which an early goal was the deciding factor. Yale had a scoring opportunity off a corner kick in the last minute, but it was unable to connect in its sixth loss of the season.
Despite struggling thus far in the 2013 season, the Crimson is optimistic about its chances this weekend against the rival Elis.
“It definitely is a game I think we can win, and we’re expecting to win,” Harrington said. “It’s just going to take a special effort to put the ball in the net.”
Friedman and Harrington both noted the necessity of keeping possession and maintaining the Harvard style of play.
“Dealing with [Yale’s] high pressure will be a high priority for this week’s preparation,” Harrington said. “It’s win or go home for the most part at this point.”
This will be Yale coach Brian Tompkins 18th Harvard-Yale game, whereas Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer will be facing the Bulldogs for the first time at the helm of the Harvard squad. Both coaches acknowledged that the matchup between rival schools brings a special excitement beyond just a regular conference game.
“You can really sense the excitement that the rivalry brings out,” Lehrer said. ”I don’t think it matters what anyone’s record is. It’s always an important game and it’s always going to be a close game.”
“The Yale-Harvard rivalry is a special one because of the schools’ histories and the special similarities and differences we have,” Tompkins added. “Regardless of the sport or the event, it’s a big game that neither school wants to lose. Saturday’s game kicks off what promises to be an exciting Ivy League season, and the fact that it’s a rivalry game makes it even more special. I’m sure it will be close and tightly contested.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just over a month and a half until the season begins, the Harvard men’s basketball team needed just about a day and a half to clinch commitments from two recruits this past weekend.
Shortly after the end of their official campus visits, Chris Egi and Andrew Chatfield both proverbially donned a Crimson jersey on Sunday in committing to Harvard.
“I got a chance to meet the players [and] spend a little time with them,” Chatfield said. “I felt really comfortable there.”
Chatfield, a three-star guard from Georgia, will add yet another consistent shooting stroke to the Harvard backcourt. Listed at 6’5”, Chatfield’s jumper is what his Norcross High School coach, Jesse McMillan, calls his “bread and butter”.
“He’s very, very long, so his length allows him to be be very successful on the floor,” McMillan said. “He is an excellent perimeter shooter. That’s what he’s most known for…What he will do for Harvard is he will provide the team with a young man that can stretch the defense, and then knock down the open three.”
With co-captain Laurent Rivard graduating in May, Chatfield’s ability to connect from deep will be key for a Crimson squad that will be without a consistent three-point threat.
Chatfield’s commitment was not the product of just a few days of recruitment. The high school senior stated that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker was present at almost every one of his AAU games, including those in Indianapolis and Las Vegas—“the good and the bad.”
“Coach Amaker did a good job of recruiting me,” Chatfield said. “[He was] always there, calling and checking on me…He came down here [to Georgia] and personally spoke to my parents a few weeks ago. He had a good long conversation with us.”
Chatfield’s other top choices included LSU, Stanford, and Tulane. Ultimately, McMillan explained, a large part of Chatfield’s decision was academic.
“He’s really an impressive kid … because he’s able to balance his books and be a high level athlete,” McMillan said. “[Chatfield] had quite a few colleges and universities that were interested in him and recruiting him over the years, but I think everyone kind of knew, and he made it known, that he was interested in the academic side of things, so an Ivy League program was always a strong possibility.”
With the short plane ride from Georgia to Massachusetts, that “possibility” became a reality.
“He’s grinning ear to ear in school today,” added McMillan.
Arguably a more important addition to the Crimson Class of 2018 is Egi, a four-star center from Markham, Canada, who currently plays at Montverde Academy in Montverde, Fla. Egi’s announcement makes this the second consecutive year Amaker has drawn a top-100 prospect into the program, the other being freshman Zena Edosomwan. Despite the timing of their respective commitments, Chatfield said he and Egi didn’t discuss their impending decisions.
“We didn't really talk about it,” Chatfield said. “Throughout the whole weekend, he was also having a good time. He enjoyed the environment and playing some five-on-five [with the team].”
The third basketball recruit on campus for the weekend, guard Justin Gray from Tampa, Fla., also enjoyed his time at Harvard, according to Chatfield. But on Thursday morning, Gray announced via Twitter that he had verbally committed to Texas Tech, ending the Crimson’s chances at landing him.
Still, it was a highly successful visit for the Harvard basketball program, which looks to reload next year and maintain the momentum Amaker has built over the last few seasons.

As almost any Harvard student can tell you, Yogurtland is the place to go for economical yogurt. Why? Because the first three ounces are free every time with a Harvard student ID, with no per day limit. After recovering from this pleasant news, the question that you might be asking is: how can they offer this deal and hope to stay in business? We at Flyby wondered the same thing, so we got in touch with Professor Jeffrey A. Miron, a senior lecturer on economics, to see what he had to say on the subject.
 
Miron wrote in an email to Flyby, “Yogurtland has made a mistake!” 
 
So why would Yogurtland management have made this decision? As Eddie Barrios, Yogurtland Regional Operations Manager, told Flyby in September, "We just want to tell everyone that we're here, and we're open. Come try us out."
It is conceivable that the chain hopes that if they attract new customers with this deal, Miron wrote, these customers will keep coming back even after Yogurtland has eliminated the deal.
It might also be the case that the cost of yogurt is small compared to other expenditures. Miron wrote: “If the bigger costs for Yogurtland are staff, space, machines, etc.,” it may not be that significant to give away some yogurt to all student customers. But does this analysis underestimate the student appetite for free yogurt?
 
Perhaps the best answer is that most people just don’t know how much three ounces really is. Weight adds up quickly, especially when one starts adding heavy—but delicious—toppings. Even the most cost-effective customer may end up with more weight—and therefore a higher price—than intended.
 
 In Professor Miron’s book (his figurative book—his actual book can be found here), this deal might turn out to be too generous. Yogurtland might do better to offer it for a limited time only. The other possibility is that a limit could be put in place. Instead of giving students a free three ounces every time they visit, Yogurtland could offer the deal only some of the time, making it difficult for people to benefit to the same extent as they do now.
 
 Thanks to Professor Miron for his advice, but all the same, as students, let’s hope that he doesn’t take over Yogurtland any time soon!

With punch season now in full swing, it’s time to present the results of Flyby’s first-ever Final Club Survey. The online survey was emailed out last month to 4,838 sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and was partially or fully completed 1,927 times (though it should be noted that individuals could have taken the survey more than once). In the fourth installment of a six-part series, we've decided to take a break from reporting on our results to share with you a compilation of some Crimson-reported snippets from the past eight decades of the final clubs' storied history.
September 30, 1932: October 21 Will Be Initial Date for Club Pledging of Sophomores
The regulations governing activities of clubs this fall in regard to canvassing Freshman and pledging Sophomores were announced recently by the Graduate Advisory Committee.
Since 1914 the undergraduate clubs have agreed that their members will not canvass members of the Freshman class and that they will not elect any undergraduate before the fourth Monday after the opening of College in his Sophomore year, and that no pledge or promise from any Sophomore shall be accepted before the Friday following the fourth Monday.
May 18, 1949: Phoenix Club May Question Sphinx Name  
The newly approved Sphinx Club may be obliged to change its name if the Phoenix S. K. Club has its way. According to Edward C. Wilson, Jr. '49, president of the Phoenix, the name "Sphinx" is the name of a club already in existence.
In reply to Wilson's charge John K. Lally '49, one of the founders of the brand new club and "graduate adviser" said, "We are bigger than the Phoenix and I think we can take care of ourselves."
Lally also claimed credit for inventing the name of the new society.
November 22, 1958: The Final Clubs: Little Bastions of Society in a University World that No Longer Cares 
In Chestnut Hill, a girl at a debutante party used her stock conversational opener with a new dancing partner: "So you go to Harvard. What Club are you in?" In Cambridge, an undergraduate wishing to contact the Harvard Flying Club was surpised and a bit mystified when the voice at the other end of the telephone told him politely that the Fly Club had nothing to with airplanes.
These are the two distinct worlds of which Harvard's Final Clubs find themselves a part. One is the world of Society, whose population is found largely on the pages of East Coast Social Registers and whose habitat lies far beyond the borders of Cambridge 38. Here Harvard is often equated with the Clubs, and a father tends to measure his son's college success not by the rank of his degree, but by the prominence of the Club he makes.
The other world is the University itself, where a rather obvious curtain of silence hangs around the attractive brick buildings, centered on Mt. Auburn St., which house the Final Clubs. This is a world where few undergraduates know much about the Clubs, and even fewer care.
June 16, 1966: College's Final Clubs Enjoy Secluded Life In a World that Pays Little Attention to Them 
When a newly initiated member of the Porcellian Club complained last year that sitting in a leather chair and singing praises to the walls was not the stimulating experience he had expected from club life, Theodore Roosevelt IV, '65 let him in on a bit of Porcellian philosophy. "We may be passive," Roosevelt said, "but we're aggressively passive."
While other undergraduate organizations produce plays or publish journals, the members of Harvard's 11 Final Clubs devote their energies to maintaining a refuge from such endeavors. For the more conscientious members of the more conscientious members of the more prestigious clubs, it can turn into a full-time occupation.
October 10, 1978: Women Invade All Male Punching Party
Eight women dressed in suitcoats and ties entered the punching party of the Delta Upsilon (D.U.) final club Sunday in an effort to sexually integrate the traditionally all-male bastion. 
Stewart Shofner '79 and Stephen A. Kowal '79, club members, gathered eight of their female friends and nominated or "punched" them for membership in the club under male pseudonyms.
Shofner said yesterday they punched the women in an effort to expose the sexism of the traditional all-male membership and to test the reaction of the club members.
April 24, 1984: Final Club Ties Examined 
The student-faculty Committee on College Life yesterday outlined a compromise resolution on the College's ties to final clubs. They will vote on the proposal in an upcoming meeting.
The resolution calls for the severing of all ties between the College and the private, all-male social clubs, which have refused to adopt a non-discrimination policy required of all recognized student organizations.
Under the terms of the resolution, these clubs would be asked to pay "a surcharge above and beyond costs for all services rendered by the University or its agents."
October 2, 1996: Graduate Council Bans Beer Kegs at Final Clubs
The graduate board presidents of Harvard's eight final clubs voted unanimously this summer—as part of sweeping reforms in the clubs' guest and alcohol policies—to ban beer kegs at all club buildings.
At the July 3 meeting, the graduate board presidents, known collectively as the Inter-Club Graduate Council, also agreed to limit each club member to two guests at all times except parties, to require members to register visitors and to hold members responsible for the behavior and safety of their visitors.
Each club party, which is defined as a gathering that exceeds the two-guests-per-member policy, must now be approved in advance by the club's graduate board president.
March 18, 1995: Final Club Closed After Recruit is Beaten in Fight  
A high school senior recruited for the Varsity football team was severely beaten in a fight with a team player at the D.U. final club a month ago, the recruit and other players said yesterday.
The D.U. was closed Wednesday for a one-month "cooling-off period," D.U. Vice President David M. Sprinkle '96 said yesterday.
Louis I. Kane '53, the president of the D.U.'s graduate board, said even after the club reopens, it will shut down at 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights for the remainder of the academic year.
October 24, 2005: E-mails Offer Glimpse of Club 
A website containing an archive of internal e-mails, publicly accessible until it was discovered by The Crimson late last week, provides a rare glimpse into the secretive Harvard final club scene—and a portrait of a five-year-old all-female club struggling to find a place within it. 
The e-mails, which contained details about the day-to-day operations of the Isis Club, were posted on a website that was publicly available because club officers apparently failed to activate a setting that would have closed it to non-members, according to Matthew A. Gline ’06, president of the Harvard Computer Society (HCS), which hosts the e-mail list.
In e-mail exchanges that were compiled on the website, the club members posted judgments about females seeking entrance, disclosed their decision to enact an informal détente with the all-female Bee Club, and revealed their reliance on male clubs for social space.

Another week, another round of college admissions news. Check back in next Friday for more!
AFFIRMING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION The Department of Education and Justice has taken an official stand in the argument raging around use of race in college admissions decisions. In a letter released on Oct. 27, the department vocalizes their support for universities and colleges looking to create and maintain a culturally and racially diverse student population.
RESEARCH TO ADMISSION Bard College is making all the headlines this past week by unveiling its new admissions policy: Write four, 2,500 word research papers worthy of a B+ or higher and you don’t need to worry about pesky things like grades, SAT scores, or glowing recommendations. Bard’s decision to turn its back on a more typical application is a direct result of a system “loaded with a lot of nonsense that has nothing to do with learning," says President Leon Botstein. Bard isn’t the only college with unorthodox requirements, but it does take originality to a new extreme.
WRITE IT OUT For the rest of those colleges that haven’t abandoned the good old college essay, HuffPo has some useful advice to get through the process. If you still feel uninspired, this author has some ideas to get the creative juices flowing that put the "fun" in functional.
SAT S-U-C-K-S Business Week has allied itself with high-schoolers nationwide in the fight against the dreaded SAT/ACT. While high-school opposition might stem more from the fact that the tests are typically held early on Saturday mornings, Peter Coy of Business Week has a more compelling argument, calling standardized tests "barriers" to higher education.
RANK RANKINGS Harvard University President Drew Faust has expressed her disapproval of Obama’s proposal to rank colleges and adjust federal financial aid based on said rankings, calling the plan “misguided.”
ACROSS THE POND Clearly the Times Higher Education magazine has got some stars-and-stripes envy. The London publication ranked U.S. colleges as seven of the top ten universities in the world. Caltech tops the list, with Harvard University and University of Oxford tied for second.
