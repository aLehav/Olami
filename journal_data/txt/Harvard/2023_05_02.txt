After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Marie Lu is a superstar in YA fiction. With over 12 books under her belt, she’s gone from a newcomer in the genre to one of its veterans. But for Lu, writing is more than a job: It’s about the act of creating, something that she has pursued for most of her life.
Lu didn’t always know she was going to be a writer. She majored in Biology and Political Science at the University of Southern California, thinking that she was going to be either a doctor or a lawyer. After graduation, Lu was preparing to go to law school, but something about it didn’t feel right. Instead, she applied for an internship with Disney Interactive Studios. She recounted, laughingly, how she broke the news to her mother over a phone call.
“I called my mom and was like, ‘Mom, I’m not going to law school anymore. I’m going to go to Disney and work for the video game division for six months.’” she said. “And I could tell in her voice, she was just like, ‘Oh, god, she’s going to be living in our basement forever.’”
Working in the video game industry gave Lu a different perspective on creating. “As with film and most of the creative media, there's a group of people that you're working with,” she said. “You're not just alone in a room writing. You have other people to answer to.”
Her time working with visual media also influenced her interest in storytelling in different mediums. Beyond her own novels, Lu illustrated “Gemina” by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff, providing sketches that propelled the protagonist’s narrative. But Lu always finds herself returning to writing as her favorite way to create.
“Books are just such a pure form of storytelling,” she said. “There's nothing particularly fancy about it. It’s not big budget, it's not flashy, but it's just you. And you’re creating alone in a cave.”
Though the YA community has come a long way in terms of diversity, Lu was one of the few Asian Americans in the publishing industry when she started out. Having immigrated to the US when she was five years old, Lu said, “I think as an immigrant, you always have one foot in each place that you’ve been in. And so both China and America have felt like home to me at different points, and both have also felt like strange lands.”
The feeling of being an outsider permeates Lu’s stories. Her characters often find themselves plunged in unfamiliar worlds and environments that they fight to stay grounded in. Talin Kanami, the heroine in Lu’s “Skyhunter” duology, is a refugee in a country that discriminates against her. And in her latest novel, “Stars and Smoke,” a superstar singer is thrust into a foreign, “Mission Impossible”-esque world of espionage and spies.
In the beginning, Lu struggled with showcasing her true self in an industry that didn’t always feel so welcoming. “I remember, in 2011, feeling incredibly intimidated by the fact that Day in ‘Legend’ is partly Asian,” she said. “At the time, the New York Times list was almost exclusively white and straight. I think I could count on one hand the number of other Asian American authors that I knew.”
Lu remembers how she seemed forced to choose between authenticity and commercial success, wondering, “Should I be writing authentically to who I am and potentially end my career? Do I end up getting shoved into some corner of the bookstore about diversity, or do I hide that and become successful?”
Lu’s experience was emblematic of a larger problem within YA and children’s books at the time. In 2014, in response to an all-white, all-male panel at BookCon, #WeNeedDiverseBooks was launched to address the problem of a homogenous literary scene where the de facto story told seemed to be that of a white person’s. Perhaps it was no wonder that Lu, like so many other authors of color, did not feel at home in the industry.
It’s evident in Lu’s extensive repertoire that she’s become more confident in celebrating her identity as time goes by. In “Warcross,” published in 2017, the main characters Emika Chen and Hideo Tanaka are Chinese-American and Japanese. When reading the familial interactions between Emika and her father and between Hideo and his parents, the attention and care that Lu has paid to the backgrounds of her protagonists stands out.
The authenticity of the characters that Lu creates allows her to make the most imaginative and fantastical settings feel startlingly familiar. The “Legend” series takes place in a futuristic, dystopian America deep in civil war; “The Young Elites” duology is set in a bleak, Renaissance Italy-inspired land. Yet despite these grim settings, the characters are refreshingly idealistic, motivated by a common goal: to do the right thing.
A common criticism of the YA genre is that it feels contrived. There always is a happy ending, the couple always ends up together. Yet this is part of what makes a Marie Lu novel so comforting — there’s a palpable belief in the goodness of human nature and the agency of a single person to effect change, no matter how dark their situation gets.
The characters in her books choose to take control of their fates and change the narrative, and in a sense, Lu does so too. The choice to believe in happy endings is defiant in the face of the dystopian-like realities of the 2020s, and for Lu, it's a comforting one.
“It's one of my favorite things about YA, that no matter how dark the stories are — and a lot of them get very, very dark — there is always a thread of hope in it,” she said. “I know that when I go into one, I'm probably going to get some kind of good ending and that the good guys are going to, in some way, win. And I've always appreciated that about YA fiction. I find it tremendously comforting to write.”
Her teen characters’ optimism isn’t entirely unbelievable either. Lu reflected on how she’s inspired by the current generation of youth, and of the news stories of young people fighting for sweeping, global change.
“It’s kind of heartbreaking to me because you should be able to worry about exams, and prom, and these things that come with being a young person, and yet you’re taking on these big, huge things in life,” she said. “I’ve always found that incredibly inspiring. I find myself writing about that all the time in my stories as a result.”
The characters in Lu’s books often seem superhuman, and sometimes they literally are. But the vast majority of her characters are simply teenagers unwittingly thrust into the spotlight, trying their best to follow their moral compasses and fighting against injustices that they see — a relatable message that transcends fantasy. The very human struggles of her superhuman protagonists ground them back to reality and make Lu’s message clear: You don’t have to be the Chosen One — you just have to be a good person.
The stories that Lu writes are intensely personal — a quality that allows her novels to resonate deeply with her readers. But these deeply confessional stories come with their own difficulties — it’s a more vulnerable form of storytelling, too. As a writer, Lu has to navigate the balance of writing authentically and separating herself from her art once it's released into the world — that is, separating criticism of her book from criticism of herself.
“I think it's really difficult in all the creative industries, actually, to put your work out there, because you have to put a little piece of your soul into your writing — into whatever it is you're creating — but you also have to commodify it,” she said. “You have to sell a piece of your heart in order to make it work. And it's a strange feeling, but over time, I've learned to be at peace with the idea that I am not a book. I am a person.”
Ultimately, Lu wants to continue creating and telling stories, and she’s enthusiastic about exploring other mediums. “Legend” is in the midst of a TV adaptation; Lu is developing the series with Lindsay Sturman and has a hand in writing the pilot as well. She’s excited about writing more in the Hollywood world and practicing screenwriting in general. But no matter what Lu pursues in the future, she’ll always be a creator, trying to tell a good story.

The first rule that one learns in college is quite simple: Don’t steal work from others. R. F. Kuang’s latest book, “Yellowface,” delves into what happens when one strays from this golden rule. “Yellowface” follows white author June Hayward and her friend Athena Liu, a Chinese-American author who has been working on a book about Chinese laborers in World War I. Following Athena’s untimely death, June steals her manuscript and attempts to build up her career through Athena’s work. The book then follows the anxiety-inducing ways that June tries to hide and then justify her theft. “Yellowface” is a fast-paced and biting commentary on racism, white privilege, and the publishing world’s evils, but it fails to reach its full potential due to its lack of narrative subtlety.
“Yellowface” deftly deals with serious, pressing topics. It offers up an important analysis of the publishing world, which tramples authors underfoot and tokenizes minorities. In the novel, readers see authors of color forced by their publishing houses to write stories only about their experiences as minorities, and white authors complaining that authors of color are just trendy instead of talented. Kuang clearly demonstrates sides of the book world that readers often choose to ignore, including how publishing houses see authors of color only through the lens of diversity, the ways in which the industry normalizes casual racism, and the various excuses that white authors make for insensitivity and ignorance. Kuang doesn’t refrain from holding publishing houses accountable for their treatment of writers of color, and “Yellowface” explores an underbelly of the writing world that few acknowledge.
While the novel discusses heavy topics, it moves at an incredibly engaging speed. Through fast-paced dialogue, June’s racing inner thoughts, and nonstop anxiety-inducing plot twists, Kuang’s prose mimics the constant streams of content that flood social media feeds. This allows the reader to fly through the novel’s pages as if it were a particularly engrossing Twitter thread. It also mirrors the rapidity of public opinion and outrage, both of which play significant roles in the novel’s plot. It feels impossible to put “Yellowface” down as its twisting plot unfolds.
The positive aspects of “Yellowface,” however, can be overshadowed by the novel’s not-so-subtle connections to its author. One can’t help but compare Athena, the author that dies at the beginning of the novel, to Kuang herself: She is a young, Ivy-League-educated, Chinese-American female author who got her first book deal in college, writes about the Asian diaspora through a historical lens, and raves about her books on Instagram — many qualities reflected in Kuang herself. Athena at times feels like a stand-in for the author who wrote her, resulting in a distracting disruption of the suspension of disbelief. Still, this makes the book feel meta: June proclaims near the novel’s end that she will write “a pseudo-autobiography in which I blur fact and fiction.” “Yellowface” does indeed toe this line between fact and fiction, but it’s not subtle enough to be satisfying.
“Yellowface” is also bogged down by its constant references to social media, and it is easy to see the book becoming dated in a few years. It refers to Twitter ad nauseam, Goodreads plays a part in the plot, and the main character is addicted to “death-scrolling.” Ultimately, the book spends more time analyzing June’s Instagram feed than developing a critique of the publishing industry or the oppression of minority authors. Especially when one considers the uncertain future of Twitter, the book seems to hold elements which may quickly become obsolete. However, this also proves that “Yellowface” is a book of its own moment, and it may captivate readers who are themselves prone to going down the rabbit hole of Twitter threads all day.
“Yellowface” is a novel difficult to put down, especially as its darker elements unfold. Kuang’s commentary on the dark side of publishing is eye-opening, especially to those heavily involved in the book community, but it also appears as if she can’t fully remove herself from the subject. The novel is too heavy-handed to feel revolutionary, but “Yellowface” is still addictive, entertaining, and important.

Three years after the beginning of the pandemic, it is still quite a feat to experience the buzz of a full house at the theater. Opening at the Citizens Bank Opera House on April 19, the excitement at the North American Tour of Lincoln Center Theater’s revival of “My Fair Lady” was a triumphant sight for optimistic Boston theater-goers, but unfortunately lacked the powerful performance to back it up.
This revival of “My Fair Lady,” enriched with Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner’s fantastic score and Bartlett Sher’s direction, offered Boston’s sleepy audiences a slight adaptation to the Broadway classic. Sher’s choice to change the tone of the musical’s final moment landed beautifully with those familiar and aggravated by the 1964 Audrey Hepburn film adaptation. Performances by Madeline Powell (Eliza Doolittle) and Jonathan Grunert (Professor Henry Higgins) were steeped in nostalgia for classic Broadway that felt familiar, if a little overdone. But in supporting roles and design, the revival hit its stride.
Dominated by heavy Cockney accents, Powell and the ensemble stumbled through the first act, losing some of the quick exposition needed to properly situate Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering (played by John Adkison). Powell, Grunert, and Adkison eventually recovered, and their energetic performance of the infamous “The Rain in Spain” marked a vital turning point in the embodiment and ownership of the trio’s characters. Only in a few of the musical’s most famous moments, namely “I Could Have Danced All Night” and “Get Me to the Church On Time,” did the performance regain its momentum and spirit.
Powell and Grunert plateaued through most of the second act, limited in both power and intrigue. In their over-rehearsed domination of the stage, the audience lost the developing and incredibly significant friendship between Eliza and Colonel Pickering and the absolute brilliance of Madeline Brennan’s Mrs. Pearce. The second act was, in turn, saved by the explosion of energy and bravado that accompanied Alfred P. Doolittle’s (played by Michael Hegerty) “Get Me to the Church On Time.” Hegerty’s phenomenal performance and Catherine Zuber’s exuberant costume design revived a quiet audience and fatigued stage, an unforeseen highlight of the entire revival. In addition to Hegerty’s redemptive high spirits, Becky Saunders’s Mrs. Higgins stood out as perfectly snarky and hilariously apt. The second act’s gravity and excitement seemed to revolve around these spectacles, leading one to ask through the rest of the performance, Where did this energy go?
The show’s final moment, altered from its film adaptation by Sher, proved to be much less infuriating than Eliza’s submissive return to the Professor, if a little anticlimactic. Grunert remained unfortunately static, but Powell was more self-assured, stepping into the show’s final scenes with renewed vigor.
In its tour, “My Fair Lady” struggled only slightly to uphold its classic design elements. The modified traveling scenic design fell short of its nuanced potential, redeemed only by lighting designer Donald Holder’s careful attention to detail. In a story reliant on spaces delineated by wealth and class, it is Holder’s focus on Professor Higgins’ home and Covent Garden that made all the difference. Zuber’s costume design retains the very same excellence and idiosyncrasies as her work in the much-awarded “Moulin Rouge.”
But for all its national acclaim, the revival of “My Fair Lady” in Boston presents a very interesting product of the city. The Broadway classic, beloved as it is, is full of terribly outdated assumptions and storylines, perfect for an audience of Boston Brahmins, but rather jarring to unfamiliar theater-goers. It is a supposedly “safe” choice, one that fills post-Covid seats with its recognizable program and songbook, but a choice that feels reactionary and conservative in a moment where innovation or significant reinvention is possible. Theater, especially in Boston, will undoubtedly continue to struggle, but the presence of “My Fair Lady” in the city’s art scene places it at odds with institutions like the Metropolitan Opera, which has wholeheartedly invested in new and risky contemporary work. The show’s middling reception is telling, and offers Bostonians a nice night out at the theater rather than a memorable performance.

Across thousands of independent bookstores in America, readers can almost certainly find a romance section, toppling with literature that reinforces the tropes of romantic relationships. But what about all of the other intricate and essential relationships in life? Author and essayist Christie Tate argues that every bookstore should have a friendship section — a place to bring powerful, non-romantic friendships to the forefront of readers’ minds.
Tate’s writing is especially memorable because of her unapologetic honesty about her life. In the writing world, Tate may be best known for her 2020 publication of her memoir, “Group: How One Therapist and a Circle of Strangers Saved My Life.” Awarded as a New York Times bestseller and Reese Witherspoon Book Club Pick, “Group” intimately detailed Tate’s experience with group therapy, breaking down the stigma of openly writing about mental health and treatment.
Her newest memoir, “B.F.F.: A Memoir of Friendship Lost and Found,” exhibits this same unconditional honesty, but it works to break down a different barrier present in the literary space. In a world congested with literature covering romantic relationships, Tate lays the blueprint for a new genre of friendship writing. While “B.F.F.” mainly focuses on Tate’s relationships with her late friend, Meredith, Tate also weaves together her countless other friendships, from those created on elementary school playgrounds to newer relationships from her adult life.
Much like her first memoir, Tate is unafraid to write about difficult moments in her life. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Tate reflected on her specific process for choosing which friendships she wanted to include in the book.
“I think I chose the ones that were the most dramatic and the most heartbreaking,” said Tate. “I thought about people who, if I saw them on the sidewalk and I ran into them, how would I react? And the ones where I wanted to hide behind a brick wall — those are the ones that I should write about.”
By including her more difficult and broken friendships in this memoir, Tate specifically challenges the term “B.F.F.” The notion of “Best Friend Forever” remains such a permanent part of popular culture — the idea that a friendship must be a perpetually beautiful relationship that stands the test of a lifetime. Tate argues otherwise.
“The premise of my book is not ‘all friendships last forever.’ That is not the premise at all,” Tate said. “The premise is, when is repair possible? I really wanted to illuminate some of my scars and talk about what I’ve learned, because there are plenty of relationships that just lasted a season.”
By including examples of friendships that lasted for a few months or several years, Tate successfully challenges the assumption that true friendships must be lifelong. Tate also questions if “best” is a word that should ever describe an intimate relationship. Her writing suggests that describing a friendship with the adjective “best” is a kind of categorical error, seeing as a quantitative metric cannot attempt to describe something as immaterial as a human relationship.
“Trying to be the best is really problematic,” she said. “I have an energy inside of me that is about striving and trying to be the best, but that’s not the best energy to bring to a friendship. The better energy for a friendship is softer, it’s fluid, it’s more encompassing.”
Unlike portrayals of effortless female friendships in media, Tate also stresses that all friendships require work. But when is the work worth it? She asks herself a similar question, reflecting, “When are we spinning our wheels and when are we deepening intimacy? That’s the central question of my life, forget about my books.”
Digging deeper into this idea, Tate differentiates between the “good” and “bad” work that it takes to power a friendship.
“My latest working thesis is, I’m in a good pain if I’m being honest and I’m setting boundaries and I’m not treating anyone like they’re fragile,” she said. “I’m in darker waters, or ‘bad pain’ if you will, if I’m not willing to speak up or tell the truth or say honestly what I want, or if I’m desperately afraid of hurting someone because I’m perceiving them having some kind of fragility.”
Beyond her thoughtful words and writing, Tate also has a willingness to put her ideas into immediate practice. She stressed the need to not only talk about the importance of friendships but to implement friendship-building practices into one’s daily routine.
In the context of her book tour for “B.F.F.”, Tate shared a simple yet impactful practice she applied to her own life. Despite the typical practice being for publicists to book hotel rooms for touring authors, Tate chose to prioritize her friendships instead.
“My rule for myself was if someone lives in the city where I was going, then I would stay with them,” she said. “It’s been scary, but so wonderful.”
Among Tate’s most powerful qualities as a writer is her altruistic writing style — an ability to share the very real, often painful parts of her life in an effort to help those around her. Despite the lacking coverage of female friendship in literature and media, it remains even more difficult to find authors who are willing to talk about the null result — the friendships that, despite the time and work put into them, just didn’t quite work out. Tate, however, remains open to sharing these personal moments.
“I have a sense I’m not the only woman out there that feels ashamed or disappointed with friendships. I’m talking to her, I want her to feel less alone,” she said.
In the midst of bachelorette parties and maid of honor speeches of reality TV shows and commercials for glittery friendship bracelets, Christie Tate is the reality check. Tate simultaneously reminds readers of the sacred beauty that a friendship can offer to life, while always making sure to hold the reader’s hand through the tumultuous work that every relationship requires.

Emily Henry is one for continuity. Her novel “Happy Place” is the fourth installment in what is jokingly called the EHCU (Emily Henry Cinematic Universe), a series of standalone novels that exist in the same world — as she revealed in a crossover short story “Layover.” With three previous books celebrated for their compelling cast of characters, fascinating backstories, and satisfying romances, “Happy Place” has a lot to live up to. Though it falls short of the brilliance of her previous works, “Happy Place” is still sexy, charming, and meaningful — a book well worth reading for Henry’s fans.
“Happy Place” follows ex-fiancés Harriet, a conflict-avoidant surgical resident, and Wyn, a quick-witted charmer who dances through life. They share a group of close friends that, for the last decade, have scheduled an annual getaway to a small cottage in Maine as a respite from their daily lives. But this year, Harriet and Wyn haven’t told their friends that they have broken up, leaving them lying through their teeth for a week as they pretend to be a couple to avoid breaking their friends’ hearts.
Emily Henry shot to fame for her novels that straddle the genres of contemporary fiction and romance — books that not only focus on the central romance, but also create complicated, vulnerable female protagonists that the reader cannot help but root for. The romances in her novels are satisfying because characters have to earn their Happily Ever After. They need to grow, realize what’s been holding them back, and change their ways before getting together with a romantic partner. In “Beach Read,” the protagonist January has to come to terms with her grief over her father’s death before she ends up with Gus; in “Book Lovers,” Nora must let go of her need to constantly be in control before she gets together with Charlie.
However, Harriet and Wyn’s love story didn’t feel as earned as the romances in Henry’s other novels. Because the narrative relied heavily on the tensions of their fake dating and shared past, the chemistry between them did not have time to mature and develop. While in previous Henry novels, the witty banter between the characters serves to introduce the tension and personalities, the banter between Harriet and Wyn as they fake a happy relationship for their friends felt out of place. Their slow burn romance did not feel like something that had to be earned, and therefore the Happily Ever After, while satisfying, did not feel as deserved.
The book is written in a non-chronological structure that alternates between the Maine cottage set in the present day (with chapters titled “Real Life”) and flashbacks to Harriet’s past (which are titled “Happy Place” and, as the novel progresses to its climax, “Dark Place”). This nonlinear structure, while used successfully in Henry’s “People We Meet On Vacation,” causes the pace of “Happy Place” to suffer. Harriet and Wyn’s physical affection and chemistry in the flashbacks, while palpable, do not reach the dizzying heights of Henry’s previous novels. This may be because she has to juggle the couple’s history while fleshing out the fairly large ensemble cast, as well as developing Harriet’s personal backstory. The angst and yearning that characterized Harriet and Wyn’s relationship in the present-day chapters was therefore not as convincing, seeing as how the characters clearly still had feelings for each other. It was unclear, up until the final third of the book, what was preventing them from being together.
Despite these issues, Henry’s skill at creating compelling, complex characters shines through. This is the first book that Henry has written with such a sprawling ensemble cast, and she is a master at teasing out the tensions between characters. Though some of her characters — such as Parth and Kimmy, the partners of Harriet’s two best friends — feel a little underdeveloped (which is understandable given the number of balls that Henry juggles in this book), the ensemble cast is gloriously messy and perfectly shows the pains of growing up and growing apart.
Henry perfectly captures the complicated, chaotic relationships between Harriet and her two best friends, Cleo and Kimmy. Though the flashbacks to their college days occasionally feel like caricatures of the college experience, the love that Harriet has for her friends, and consequently, her yearning to return to that “Happy Place” with them, was sympathetic and relatable. It made the tensions between the three of them in the present day particularly intriguing against the backdrop of a sleepy Maine town. Henry takes her time to draw out the rifts that emerge between them, slowing down the quick pace of the novel. Henry writes her female characters with an earnestness that makes their squabbles not seem trivial — they are genuine best friends trying to find their way back to each other in a shifting relationship.
At its core, every Henry heroine comes with her own set of insecurities and problems. In “Emily’s Grocery List,” Henry’s newsletter, she wrote: “With January, I worried she’d be too emotional for readers. With Poppy, I worried she’d be too annoying. With Nora, I worried she’d be too sharp. With Harriet, I worried she’d be too spineless.”
Despite her worries, this is where Henry shined in her previous three books: each female character was complex and had their own problems to sort out, and she does right by Harriet, too.
Harriet is a people-pleaser, and Henry delves into her personal history with excruciating detail (though this, admittedly, happens mostly towards the last third of the novel). She desperately believes that she can make everyone happy, and that if she tries hard enough, she can earn love with material achievements in a “disinterested universe.” Harriet’s character is fully fleshed out and consistent with her actions, and despite her faults, Henry makes it clear that Harriet is a good person, motivated by her desire to make the people around her happy. Readers will want the best for Harriet, and it makes her an easy character to root for.
“Happy Place” may not be Henry’s strongest work, but it is undeniably a quintessential Emily Henry novel, fun in its relentless positivity and heartbreaking in its realistic portrayal of growing up. It’s well worth a read for fans of Henry — and for those unfamiliar with her work, it will still be a compelling novel.

Ed Sheeran’s newest single, “Boat,” starts out with promise. As he stands on a wavy shoreline, Sheeran's voice carves out a wistful melody above his sparse guitar, in a style reminiscent of his first album, “Plus.”
The light instrumentals and the vocal-heavy nature of the song lead the listener to hone in on Sheeran’s emotionally charged voice, which amplifies the message underlying the song. In this way, the song sets the stage for delivering most of its emotional impact through its lyrics.
However, Sheeran’s lyrics wash out into trite incongruity in “Boat.” The least confusing lines, like “I need to feel elements to remind me / there’s beauty when it’s bleak,” feel cliche and unoriginal.
As one goes deeper into the song, lyrics like “the times that I jumped never were real” become completely disconnected from any narrative arc the song might carry.
The frustrating part is that we know Sheeran can write well in this guitar-backed format — songs like “I See Fire” and “The A Team” exemplify Sheeran’s talent for hard-hitting songwriting. And yet, in “Boat,” Sheeran decides to forego his storytelling skills in exchange for a sea of subpar couplets.
A confused listener may elect to watch the music video for further clarification on Sheeran’s message.
The music video opens with a black screen. Pan to Sheeran wading in a rough sea, the waves crashing on his back. Halfway through the music video, objects start falling from the sky, signifying the memories that pummel him from above as he tries to navigate the uncharted waters of grief and pain.
Sheeran’s body, and soul, by extension, acts like the eponymous boat, lending meaning to the line “the waves won’t break my boat.” Spiritually or physically, Sheeran won’t be broken, even in a world that seems bent on destroying his hope.
The music video paired with the song creates a more raw and complete narrative that the song itself doesn’t deliver. Sheeran’s physicality in the ocean and the eye contact he makes with the camera as he shares a story so obviously meaningful to him sparks real, authentic emotions for the viewer — even if the story is one we may not completely understand.
Perhaps this is the beauty of Ed Sheeran’s songs: his honesty with his listeners. We’re able to feel, through the ridges and valleys of his voice, the heart and emotions behind each line. And at the end of the day, it is this tangibility of Sheeran’s songs that keep us coming back to his stories.
In “Boat,” Sheeran leaves the listener craving more substance, emotional charge, and cohesion. Though new listeners might not be left completely satisfied, “Boat” will certainly entrance Sheerios all over: One can practically already see sniffling audiences waving their flashlights left and right as Sheeran serenades the illuminated blackness on his ‘+-=÷✕ Tour.’

Record Store Day, held this year on April 22, is a celebration of the rich culture and history of independently owned record stores. Since its first installment in 2008, this event has united vinyl enthusiasts, musicians, and local communities in support of the unique culture surrounding vinyl records and their stores. It's a day that brings passionate music lovers together, while also helping independent record stores stay afloat in an age where digital music streaming dominates. One of the main attractions of Record Store Day is the exclusive releases that are only available at participating independent record stores, often in limited quantities. Attendees of Record Store Day will wait in line for hours just to get their hands on these exclusive records.
Record Store Day was founded by a group of independent record store owners who were inspired by the camaraderie and support they witnessed at a gathering of independent record store owners in Baltimore, Maryland. They decided to create an event that would not only celebrate the distinctive culture of record stores but also encourage music lovers to support their local independent shops.
Over the years, Record Store Day has grown exponentially, becoming a global phenomenon with thousands of stores participating in countries across the world. This event has proven to be a financial boon for independent record stores and a boost for vinyl sales. Record Store Day also offers exclusive releases, limited edition pressings, and rare reissues, providing collectors and enthusiasts with the opportunity to expand their collections.
Record Store Day has played an instrumental role in the ongoing vinyl revival. With the digital age and the rise of streaming services, vinyl records have experienced a resurgence in popularity as collectors and audiophiles alike rediscover the tactile, tangible, and immersive experience of vinyl. Record Store Day has become a driving force in supporting this growing interest, helping to ensure that vinyl records continue to thrive as a cherished music format. Collectors come out in troves to support their favorite record stores and artists.
“I just really liked that it gave me like a different way to listen to music rather than just streaming.
I felt like listening to vinyl, I could hear things that I couldn't hear as clearly in terms of production and it just sounded so much better,” Lauren Dipreta, a fan and vinyl collector said.
“I'm excited to support Phil who owns this record store [Tres Gatos] and to support some of my favorite artists by buying their exclusive releases,” Michelle Ray, a patron of Tres Gatos, said.
The exclusive records, including Taylor Swift, The 1975, Blur, and Madonna, associated with Record Store Day are another big draw for fans and collectors. Music lovers, such as Dipreta and Savannah Smith, even lined up at 4 a.m. to get their exclusive releases.
“I'm personally waiting for the Taylor Swift and The 1975 exclusive releases. They're both pretty limited releases, but I knew this store only had four copies of The1975 record, and I've been a fan of that band for 10 years,” Dipreta said.
“I'm only really here for the Taylor Swift vinyl. I am extremely new to collecting, I’m not in any kind of community. I'm like, you know what? Might as well start. I have a bunch of vinyls already so why not. I've been a fan of Taylor Swift since she started out,” Smith said.
Record Store Day attracts music fans of all ages and backgrounds. Parents will bring their kids to the event to get them exclusive releases and immerse them into the culture of vinyl-collecting. One such parent, Ty Velde, accompanied his daughter early in the morning so she can get her exclusive release.
“My daughter's a huge Taylor Swift fan and she wants the exclusive release,” Velde said. “It reminds me of when I used to camp out for concert tickets back in the day.”
Record Store Day and the act of camping out for these exclusive releases help to foster a community among collectors, newbies, and owners alike. Store owners on Record Day talked about the community they watch form in front of their eyes.
“I know all of [these people], but they don't know each other. And I've seen people become friends in the line. This actually sounds corny, but there have been people who were in relationships who met in the line for [Record Store Day],” said Phil Wilcox, manager of Tres Gatos.
“I think it helps get people interested in buying records, people that aren't already interested. So I think it certainly has brought some people into the hobby that might not have been aware of it before,” said Chris Andries, co-owner of Armageddon Shop.
Record Store Day is a big support for independent stores.
“I think for us and for every indie record store, this is like the tenfold that holds us up. This and December holiday shopping kind of allows us to survive the rest of the year,” Wilcox shared.
The enduring impact of this annual event is evident in the thriving independent record store community, the ongoing vinyl revival, and the passionate music fans who continue to cherish the unique experience that vinyl offers.

Joseph Bologne, also known as Chevalier de Saint-Georges, showed prodigal talent in nearly everything he pursued. His musical feats as an instrumentalist and composer sing passionately, but are silenced by the rich and the racist. Directed by Stephen Williams and written by Stefani Robinson, the film “Chevalier” turns the volume back up and gives Bologne a space to shine. However, the film lacks the depth that nuances his story.
The film follows Bologne (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) as he catches the eye of French aristocrats for his athletic capabilities in fencing and music critics for his mastery of the violin. This popularity leads Bologne to be involved with Marie Antoinette, (Lucy Boynton), who awards him the title of Chevalier, a title of nobility, and proceeds to hold him as a very close confidant. Additionally, Bologne meets Marie-Josephine on his rise to fame — A singer, played by Samara Weaving, who is married to a French Marquis, though she finds herself falling for the Chevalier and the two have an affair.
Another important addition to the plot is the numerous scenes of Black joy. One scene that exemplifies this theme is where Nanon (Ronke Adekoluejo), helps her son connect back to his roots. The film represents Black culture equally as well toward the end, where the Chevalier wears cornrows in favor of the classic European aristocrat wig or or ponytail. The film refreshingly addresses racism in the eighteenth century by choosing to focus on the strength and camaraderie of Black people, as opposed to producing yet another trauma narrative.
Superficially, the film is cheerful, gorgeous, and seductive. With the use of natural sunlight and warm yellow lighting, along with gorgeous period clothing and architecture, the film seamlessly transports viewers back to the eighteenth century. The acting is a particularly special ingredient to the film’s feeling as well. The actors — specifically Harrison Jr., Boynton, and Weaving — demonstrate clear chemistry that adds substantially to the dramatics of their secret romances. The film’s special attention to Bologne’s rumored affairs makes for an entertaining and aesthetically pleasing production.
Joseph Bologne took advantage of his education as a free man to learn how to fence, dance, ride horses, and play the violin. He was well known in the world of music, but also politics and athletics. Bologne’s story is a complex one, full of resolve and triumph. In “Chevalier,” however, his story is terribly underrepresented in favor of detailing the romance shared between him, Marie Antoinette, and Marie-Josephine. In this way, the film takes the spotlight off of Bologne, and puts it back on his oppressors. This is emphasized by how the only love interests in the film are aristocratic white women, and how the film makes the interactions with these love interests its focal point.
There is not nearly enough attention being paid to the importance of Bologne’s artistic and political contributions. Short clips from Bologne’s transition from the plantation to life as a free man in France are included at the beginning, and a couple of typed slides detail how he led 1,000 men in Europe’s first Black regiment. But this sprinkle of significant history cannot save the movie from the way it emphasizes rumor and speculation over historical facts. Bologne deserved to have a film that represents the most important parts of his character and achievements, and “Chevalier” glosses over it.
“Chevalier” cannot be saved by its alluring visuals and dramatic acting. It evades the integrous task of uncovering the meaningful parts of Bologne’s career. Yes, reducing Bologne’s life story to a one-hour-and-47-minute feature is an unfair ask. But is it unreasonable to focus more on his musical and political legacy and less on the rich white women he allegedly slept with?

Naked and Afraid of Finals: Students Let Out Stress by Streaking Through Harvard Yard
When Sophie H. Kim ’24 watched the opening night performance of “Silver,” a song from their original musical “ISCARIOT,” from the front row of the Agassiz Theater, the song felt different than it felt in rehearsals. The lighting, the costumes, and feeling the audience holding their breath made the experience uniquely emotional for Kim.
“Silver,” a song about feeling used, sung by a queer, poor, Korean Judas Iscariot, reimagines a moment in the New Testament when Judas betrays Jesus Christ for 30 pieces of silver.
In Kim’s version of “ISCARIOT,” which debuted at Harvard in the fall, this act is a dual betrayal: Jesus, who is running for prom king, betrays Judas by taking advantage of his friendship and campaigning skills in order to gain popularity at the rich Los Angeles high school they both attend. Then Judas sings “Silver,” expressing his feelings of being second-best to Jesus.
“Just hearing that sung on stage and being like, ‘yeah, he should know what he’s worth. He definitely should, we all should,’” Kim said.
Staging the Unstageable 
Now, Kim is working on a new project — this time even more unconventional.
While “ISCARIOT”’s beginnings were inspired by a heretical Tumblr meme about Jesus curing his disciples’ hangovers, the idea for “SWAN,” Kim’s new project, came in response to a playwriting class’s prompt that asked students to write an unstageable play.
“I wasn’t thinking in a way that was constrained by financials or even how much space am I allowed to take up as an artist,” Kim said. “I was just kind of like, just whatever you want, right? And I think that's how art should be.”
As a result, Kim created their limitlessly creative play “SWAN” — and they were awarded the 2022 Phyllis Anderson Prize for Playwriting by the American Repertory Theater for the play.
“SWAN” follows a young, gay and closeted, Korean-American man and a white, also closeted, moderately famous YouTube video creator, who roleplays being a 1950s housewife. Both characters are haunted by a character named “Swan,” who Kim describes as a mashup between Disney’s Ursula from the Little Mermaid and Tan France from the popular netflix show “Queer Eye.” Swan leads the first two characters through visions of their past and future to portray a message about how they are living their lives.
“You should try to live your authentic lives, even though it's hard and even though they’re all kind of coping with these coping mechanisms and denial,” Kim explained.
The play, set in Los Angeles, also loosely follows the ballet “Swan Lake” and includes ideas from queer theory about how queerness can be like time travel. Kim’s work also emphasizes that people can exist as multiple selves.
“Being closeted throws you out of sync, out of real time, because you’re at once in yourself, but you're also thinking about the past, thinking about the future, and are just sort of thinking of how do I want to exist in the world — while at the same time existing in the world,” Kim said.
Now, in preparation for a theater festival in June, Kim is working with a team of a director, a dramaturg, as well as seating, lighting and costuming teams to figure out how to make this unstageable idea become stageable.
Another challenge is deciding how to portray another concept that’s been on Kim's mind: monsters. “SWAN” aims to reshape the relationship between monstrosity and queerness, which is often used as an insult, as Kim pointed out.
“How can we be more imaginative in the ways that we come to ourselves – the ways that we express ourselves?” Kim said. “What if we're only afraid of monsters and what they represent because they represent a kind of freedom and a knowledge of the self that is scary?”
Performance and Mentorship 
Kim has been practicing this kind of thought and introspection for a long time. Kim remembers writing their first short stories in kindergarten and writing poetry in middle school, knowing they wanted to be an artist. Kim began performing slam poetry in high school, eventually becoming the 2018 Los Angeles Youth Poet Laureate. Their first poem in high school was called “Queerphobia; or Love, Restricted.”
Sophie remembered the excitement of seeing their words resonate with others, as well as the confidence in sharing their words for their own self-expression and empowerment.
“There’s also something really powerful about just getting up there and saying something and being like, ‘you don't have to like it, this is for me at the end of the day,’” they said.
In high school, they joined a Los Angeles-based LGBTQ+ writers’ group called Queerwise, which was originally a group of senior citizens. They invited Kim to join to bring in intergenerational voices, making Kim the youngest participant by far. Together, they would write and perform monologues about different prompts. The experience writing and performing with older LGBTQ+ writers was magical for Kim.
Outside of Queerwise, Kim dabbled in playwriting and submitted their work to their school’s playwrights’ festival. One year, Kim submitted a play about the Rental Family services in Japan, and another year they featured their play about Vincent Van Gogh and time travel. While the plays were only between 10 and 30 minutes long, they gave Kim the chance to work with professional directors and producers to see their visions come to life.
This showed Kim that seeing something through to the end — even through unglamorous activities like sending emails — was something they desired to do in the future.
“Being a part of something larger than yourself” 
In the eighth grade, amidst the poetry writing, Kim ran the gay-straight alliance at their middle school in the Beverly Hills area, where they said raising awareness was an “interesting” experience. In the meetings, the group observed the annual GLSEN Day of Silence, organized awareness weeks, planned speeches for school assemblies, and made posters to raise awareness for LGBTQ+ issues.
The identity Kim formed within this group is front and center in Kim’s art today.
“Something that is really exciting to me about queerness that was also exciting to me in middle school,” Kim said, “was just being part of this lineage and this history that these stories that are remembered but also not remembered, and this responsibility, but also this excitement, of being part of something that is larger than yourself.”

Naked and Afraid of Finals: Students Let Out Stress by Streaking Through Harvard Yard
Samuel F. Dvorak ’23 believes in the intimacy of creating theater — in particular, the power and passion of an engaged community, even throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To Dvorak, each production is like a spot of light — transient, ephemeral, and all the more beautiful for its temporality.
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Dvorak reflected on his experience in harnessing this power as a director, as well as his long, successful career in theater at Harvard.
Charting his theater journey, Dvorak mentioned that he performed in musicals and plays during high school, as well as playing in pit orchestras at community theaters. Though he came to Harvard intending to focus on developing as a musician, Dvorak describes how he found himself irresistibly drawn to the world of theater, becoming a five-time director.
“I wanted to become better at the piano, I wanted to become better at composing, Dvorak said. “So I didn't really expect that I would find myself too involved with theater.”
The First-Year Arts Program (FAP) renewed his interest in theater as the intersection between music and performance.
“FAP was one of the — if not the most — formative experiences of my life,” Dvorak said. “It's hard to avoid theater while you’re there. I quickly learned through FAP that it is in theater that all of these different disciplines come together.”
It was the First-Year Musical, however, that particularly catapulted Dvorak into the directing role, despite his lack of experience with backstage work. Though he’d initially hoped to compose for the original show, citing the “special experience” of participating in the birth of a new musical, he applied to direct “on a whim,” following advice from his sister.
“I was diving in headfirst. It was very immersive, and pushed me in so many new ways,” said Dvorak.
Dvorak sees his work as a director as a “perpetual learning experience.”
“I have been directed myself, but I've never studied directing.” Dvorak said. “Every day, I'm figuring it out as I go.”
Even though directors leave the concrete, technical details to their designers or crew, Dvorak cited the “soft skill” of cultivating an environment that nurtures the inherent passion of actors and staff alike.
“It’s about creating an environment where people feel compelled to succeed and inspired to do their best work. At the end of the day I am not onstage and acting any parts, I am not the one who is going to come up with the lighting design, or is going to draw up the set plans, or create the costumes. It is just my job to help facilitate all of these things, and help the people who are actually doing the hard work feel excited about the show and passionate about the project.”
Though Dvorak’s self-proclaimed assignment of “just making sure everything clicks” portrays direction as a simple task, the scale of his cast and crew is formidable. His most recent directorial project, the musical “Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812,” had a production team of over 70 people and a cast of 17 actors. Dvorak admitted that striking the right balance between allowing designers the freedom to enact their vision and offering adequate support — this “soft skill” has been integral to Dvorak’s directing.
“There's always a fine line of what is too much to give and what's too little to give, and I don't want to overstep, being aware that I'm not an expert in any of these fields,” Dvorak said. “But I don't want to not give direction and then have people feel not supported or like they’re not in an environment where they can be a part of one big, cohesive show.”
Dvorak praised the theater community for the unique productions that arose from the difficulties of quarantine, calling it “crazy” but “a really good time.” Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, his first-year musical was performed online, and he also participated in Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ online production of “Cox and Box.” He described innovative adaptations to the challenges of performing online, including Zoom blocking (“to the side or forward or back”), pre-recorded content, lip-syncing, and the development of a “3D, virtual, animated environment” to create the illusion of actors all in the same room. Experiencing — and shaping — the unique production of shows throughout the pandemic thus reaffirmed the connective power of theater for Dvorak.
“It was very important to me that we did not stop,” Dvorak said about his time in the wake of the pandemic. “Everything was sort of thrown up in the air, but the show must go on. And I'm very proud of what we were able to do.”
Dvorak believes that the theater community is “special,” and wistfully mused on the transient nature of each cast and crew.
“It’s a very intimate process to spend hours every day, week after week, with the same group of people creating a piece of theater; it's very much a bonding experience,” Dvorak said. “The theater community is interesting because it is somewhat transient: when “Comet” closes this weekend that group of people will never come together again.” Dvorak said.
“But the community sort of extends beyond these blips that are the productions.”
In this way, Dvorak’s directorial vision pays homage to — and draws on the strengths of — the theater community. Theater, in turn, nourishes him and “fulfills” him; he hopes to continue his theater involvement in some capacity even beyond graduation.
“I wish I had more semesters. I would very happily continue to do more shows,” Dvorak said. “And I hope to make sure that [theater] remains part of my daily life as much as it can be. And who knows where the winding road leads?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s first-year students took the stage by storm with their production of “Post Mortem: The Musical,” an original musical that promised a mix of humor, emotion, and thought-provoking moments, entirely created and produced by first-year students. “Post Mortem” ran at the Agassiz Theatre from April 27 through April 30.
Set at the fictional Bale University, “Post Mortem” follows the story of a struggling Latin department and its faculty who are thrown into chaos by the announcement of its imminent shutdown and the summoning of the Roman poet Catullus’s spirit. The characters confront the challenges of academia and navigate the complexities of their relationships with one another in a show filled with humor and references to classic Greek and Roman literature.
As the first-year musical team includes students with various levels of experience, the show displayed months of collaborative learning.
“It’s been a really lovely experience learning on the job together,” director Lola R. McKenzie ’26 said. “I think it’s a really nice way to get thrown into the arts at Harvard.”
Executive producer Gabriel K. Brock ’26 described the set design as a Latin department at a university resembling “everything that depresses you about academia.” This visual aesthetic is intended to evoke the environment of Bale University, where the story takes place. Brock’s role as executive producer has allowed him to oversee the technical and publicity aspects of the show, sharing finance responsibilities with finance producer Tammy S. Lee ’26.
“It’s really exciting to see all these individual departments that have been largely working separately come together and now see again in person what we are all thinking about and imagining,” stage manager Hugo L. M. Hinze ’26 said.
Hinze highlights the accessibility and educational aspect of the first-year musical, making it a unique opportunity for students new to theater.
Actors Noa Goldstein ’26 (Lesbia), Elizabeth M. Crawford ’26 (Tracie), and William R. Murray ’26 (Catullus) shared their enthusiasm for being part of the first-year musical, emphasizing the sense of community it fosters among students interested in the arts. They praised the student-written script and music, expressing amazement at the talent of their fellow first-year students.
“I'm having the absolute best of times. I like this because it's a great way to meet other people in our grade, especially in the arts,” Goldstein said.
“I think the coolest part for me is that it's all student-written," Crawford added.
Book writer Paul Palmer Jr. III ’26 said that the show is “definitely a musical like no other” and “definitely untraditional.”
“My favorite part of the show is the people in it,” Palmer said. “If you look at the whole amount of musicaling that we’ve done, I’ve done so very little with it and these people are taking it and like running with it.”
The writing process for “Post-Mortem” began with brainstorming sessions where the creative team pitched ideas and refined the plot. Hinze explained that the first full draft of the script was completed by winter break, with most of the songwriting and composing taking place during that time. The music in “Post-Mortem” is equally as impressive as the script. The creative team, including lyricist Eleni P. Dadian ’26 and composer Christian Liu ’26, crafted a score that perfectly captures the tone and themes of the show.
“Post Mortem” delivers a rollercoaster of emotions, with plenty of laughs and some poignant moments. One example of the comedy in the play is from Aiden J. Bowers ’26, who plays the lead role of Professor Eric Bodnar. Bowers’s comedic talent was on full display, using his facial expressions and body language to deliver hilarious moments throughout the performance.
“They should expect to laugh a lot, maybe cry at times. It's also very emotional at times,” said Hinze.
“You're gonna laugh the whole time. You're not going to stop laughing,” Crawford said.
The first-year students comprising the cast and crew of "Post Mortem” were eager and enthusiastic for the Harvard community to experience their talent and hard work.
“Come with an open mind and be ready to have fun,” Hinze said.

Naked and Afraid of Finals: Students Let Out Stress by Streaking Through Harvard Yard
Kristian A. Hardy ’24 is a self-proclaimed “multi-hyphenate creative” who is pursuing a concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media and African & African-American Studies. As someone who views theater as an all-encompassing field, she has learned to act, sing, dance, and produce, and she has some practice in set building and sound design as well. Around campus, she is well-known for her direction of the play “All the Natalie Portmans” during the Spring 2022 semester and more recently, the musical “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin” in Spring 2023.
These plays, as all of the art she aims to share, were put on with Black women and girls in mind.
“The work that I do there is also definitely to serve as a form of representation and just showing other Black girls that they can create their own realities and that their dreams are attainable,” Hardy said.
Of course, she clarified this does not mean her shows cannot be watched by people of other races and genders — everyone who wants to watch and listen to these stories is encouraged to do so — but Black viewers are the target audience.
The most obvious reason for having this specific audience is representation, but Hardy makes it clear that this is an oversimplification. According to Hardy, Generation Z has grown up with substantially more representation in media than previous generations, and she has continuously been inspired by those as part of popularizing Black women’s stories, but she recognizes that large issues remain. To Hardy, not only is representation of Black people important, but their stories and messages are just as important, if not more.
“Yes, we are represented and included, but now what stories are we telling and how is that working to further uplift our community,” she said.
There are a multitude of Black stories that offer a variety of morals and provoke various feelings, and as an artist, Hardy makes it her mission to showcase as many as possible. Inherently, this means discussing and presenting subjects that are neither palatable to wide audiences nor easy to understand and reflect on. If Black people are to be truly represented, the wide variety of their stories must be portrayed — which is why she has directed shows that deal with undertones of hardship and grief. “All the Natalie Portmans” and “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds her Chameleon Skin” express the struggles experienced by Black women, and attempt to find the humor in them. Hardy does not shy away from dealing with difficult topics in her productions.
“I just commit — you have to commit. I think if you awkwardly sidestep, especially with this past show because it was filled with so much satire, to treat the story as ‘Oh my god, are we going to offend people, are people going to feel uncomfortable?’ They should feel uncomfortable. That’s reality. That’s theater,” Hardy said.
Hardy is aware that she cannot control the audience’s reception of her art.
“That isn’t a reflection of me, they just have a different humor. They just see things differently,” she said.
This is particularly true if she sees the Black people in the audience — the people who the show is intended for — reacting in a way that shows their approval or recognition of the humor.
“At the end of the day, if I feel like what I did was fly, it’s fly. People may like it or they may not, but if I like it, I like it,” she said.
At the same time, Hardy believes in making sure the people behind the show — the cast and crew — are comfortable while practicing and experimenting. For example, “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds her Chameleon Skin” featured a song including slurs, and in response, Hardy pulled her actors aside and said they have “the agency to decide” what they felt comfortable saying, and that their safety and comfort were much more important than the production.
Directing is a laborious task, and Hardy does her best to make sure that her productions are meaningful experiences for the audience, as well as for the cast and crew.
“This semester I was the only Black director on campus. I don’t want to be that,” she said.
Hardy hopes that more Black artists — more marginalized people in general — continue to be inspired to share their stories and their art.
For now, she continues to do her part in magnifying Black stories. Next spring, her thesis performance, a solo show, will highlight the intersectionality of “Black womanhood, and queerness, and Southern spirituality.”
It takes a lot of hard work and a lot of fighting to be heard, but Hardy looks forward to a day where anyone can make art and have fun with it.

This article contains spoilers for Season 3 of “The Mandalorian” and Season 4 of “Star Wars: Rebels.”
What even is a Mandalorian?
While it may have taken three seasons of bounty hunting, space battles, and wholesome parenting moments, “The Mandalorian” finally got around to providing a full-fledged background on the planet and culture to which the series owes its name. The third season of the popular “Star Wars” series, which saw its finale release on April 19, largely deals with the journey of Din Djarin and his similarly armored compatriots in retaking the planet Mandalore, which had been rather dormant in the many years since its surface was destroyed and population decimated by the Galactic Empire. However, given that the season finds itself very rooted in the collective mission of the Mandalorians to reunite their people and return to their homeworld, it loses some of the strongest dynamics from the first two seasons: the adventure-of-the-week style and the father-son dynamic between Din Djarin and his foundling son, Grogu. At the same time, though, between including a number of veteran “Star Wars” characters and hinting at the return of others in future media, this latest season also does lay some exciting groundwork for what’s to come in this vast universe.
For fans who have seen the animated series “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” and “Star Wars: Rebels,” Mandalore is already a fairly well-known locale. The planet is portrayed as one that places a high value on tradition, especially when it comes to deciding on leadership; the right to rule is fully dependent on who possesses the darksaber — a one-of-a-kind Mandalorian weapon and a distinct variation on the typical “Star Wars” lightsaber. One Mandalorian who crosses paths with the darksaber on multiple occasions, but can never quite keep possession of it, is Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff). Bo-Katan, who joined the cast of “The Mandalorian” in Season 2 following prior appearances in both “The Clone Wars” and “Rebels,” regains possession of the darksaber in Season 3, and thus becomes the conduit in uniting the Mandalorians in their mission. While Bo-Katan’s arc shows significant character development and pays off events of the two animated series, the consequence is that she begins to feel more like the main character than Din Djarin himself, which is certainly perplexing from a narrative standpoint.
In a similar vein, the seeming conclusion of the story of Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito), the main overarching villain of “The Mandalorian” to this point, is inhibited by an impending sense of something bigger. When Gideon re-enters the fold in the seventh episode of this season, he convenes with a secretive council of high-ranking loyalist imperial officers. However, Gideon’s schemes are overshadowed by the mention of Grand Admiral Thrawn, a savvy Imperial officer and a towering figure in pre-Disney canonical “Star Wars” media. While Gideon’s own pompous, maniacal tendencies certainly could have made for an interesting power struggle upon the re-entry of Thrawn onto the scene of “Star Wars” villainy, Gideon seemingly meets his demise in a fiery explosion in this season’s finale, in what feels like an unsatisfying death and a sudden truncation of the story of a villain who has been around since the series’ first season.
Shortcomings aside, if we do decide to unabashedly dive into the ways in which “The Mandalorian” builds towards the future of the “Star Wars” universe, there is a lot to unpack. Similar to how Bo-Katan first appeared in animation before making the jump to live-action, this season of “The Mandalorian” features a cameo by Zeb Orrelios, a prominent character originally from “Rebels.” As a purple alien with a very particular design, Zeb’s live-action CGI could have been a disaster, but it actually looks fantastic in his cameo, suggesting this could be leading to a prominent role for the character in future media. Perhaps more importantly, the aforementioned return of Grand Admiral Thrawn has been eagerly awaited by “Star Wars” fans since the character’s last appearance in “Rebels” in 2018, during which his fate, as well as the fate of the series’ main character, Ezra Bridger, are left curiously ambiguous. Beyond a return to this narrative being hinted at in “The Mandalorian,” both of these characters are set to appear in the upcoming series, “Ahsoka,” as gauged by a trailer released at the fan convention Star Wars Celebration in early April. Overall, the current “Star Wars” media landscape feels as if it is shaping up to be one big “Rebels” sequel, which would certainly be a welcome reality for fans.
Ultimately, with all of the crossing over, cameos, and easter eggs taking hold of “Star Wars” television these days, it is no surprise that Star Wars Celebration also saw the announcement of a future film that will allegedly wrap up the events of the so-called “Mando-verse.” It is currently unclear if Din Djarin and Grogu will have more seasons of father-son adventures in the meantime, but with the retaking of Mandalore now complete, one can only hope that “The Mandalorian” will now return to focusing on the kind of content that did wonders for its first two seasons. As for what exact characters and storylines may be interweaved for the aforementioned film, and how the creators will conclude the events that the first season of “The Mandalorian” kicked off back in 2019, we will just have to wait and see what’s in store for the galaxy far, far away.

“I don’t do it for the money everybody,” Lewis Capaldi remarked to a packed crowd at MGM Music Hall at Fenway on April 10. “I do it for the fame and the ladies.”
It was the first of many jokes that the Scottish singer-songwriter cracked onstage after kicking off the show with a rousing rendition of his hit song “Forget Me,” the lead single off of his upcoming album “Broken by Desire to Be Heavenly Sent.” While the singer is known for his catalog of heart-wrenching breakup ballads, the atmosphere inside the music hall was far from somber. When the audience wasn’t belting along to the singer’s many hits, an infectious laughter filled the venue as Capaldi waded through a set that was part concert, part comedy show.
The show was brief — just 13 songs — but Capaldi made each track count, taking the audience on journeys of heartbreak, love, loss, and disappointment through a combination of gritty belting and tepid crooning. The singer switched between playing a guitar at center stage and walking around to interact with fans in the audience during performances of “Forever,” “Lost on You,” and “Fade,” — B-sides from his first album “Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent.”
Onstage, Capaldi is far from your average 26-year-old pop singer. In contrast to the star’s contemporaries, who go viral on TikTok for the carefully crafted outfits they debut on stage each night, Capaldi took the stage clad in baggy jeans and a wrinkled T-shirt. Paired with his trademark self-deprecating humor, it’s easy to imagine that Capaldi could be any average Joe plucked off the street. Yet with the first notes of each new song, there was a tangible shift among the audience as lagging conversations abruptly stalled, silence fell over the crowd, and all eyes turned their focus toward the stage.
Capaldi hit his stride on the back half of the set as he took listers through his biggest hits to date. He kicked off the section with a rousing rendition of his second biggest hit, “Before You Go.” Inspired by the emotional turmoil Capaldi witnessed both in himself and his family members in the wake of his aunt’s suicide, “Before You Go” is a dark reflection on the helplessness and regret felt by the loved ones she left behind.
Somehow even while discussing heavy topics like depression and suicide, Capaldi found a way to keep the mood light.
“She was a nice lady, but sometimes she was a real bitch,” Capaldi remarked before thanking his aunt for the money he’d made off the smash hit.
Capaldi then switched gears sitting at a piano for a stripped back performance of “Bruises,” the first track the singer ever released. Backed by little more than sparse piano chords, Capaldi showed off the powerhouse vocals that have propelled him to global stardom, embracing the raw grit demanded by the breakup song's soaring chorus.
Before moving to his next song — the slightly more upbeat “Grace” — Capaldi again proved his comedy chops, revealing that the piano he sat at was actually fake.
“I can’t even play the instrument,” the singer remarked as “Für Elise” began to play from offstage.
While some artists spend their sets winning over the audience, that wasn’t the case with Capaldi: He had fans enraptured from the beginning. Both on stage and in his recent Netflix documentary, “Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now,” the star discussed his experience with Tourette Syndrome, explaining how his tics manifested onstage through coughs, twitches, and shrugs. Capaldi has gone viral several times in recent months as fans have stepped in to finish singing his hits when the singer was unable to do so.
At his Boston show, fans stepped in to finish the final chorus of “How I’m Feeling Now,” after the singer was unable to continue singing. The track is the strongest showing yet from his upcoming sophomore album, encapsulating both Capaldi’s rich vocals and plucky personality which can otherwise exist in opposition to each other. In perfectly capturing Capaldi’s dueling identities, the introspective and self-conscious track is a raw and powerful reflection on success, happiness, and doubt that feels particularly authentic.
Going out on top, Capaldi finished the show with a performance of “Someone You Loved,” finally giving the audience the moment many had been waiting for all night. Capaldi let the audience lead, taking in the energy and adoration as every audience member belted out “Now the day bleeds / Into nightfall / And you're not here / To get me through it all.”
While Capaldi’s set was short and sweet, fans didn’t seem to mind. Having heard the singer’s best tracks and best jokes, Capaldi ensured that fans left smiling despite his heartbreak heavy discography.

“...Do you have letterboxd?”
Since the moment I arrived at college, I find myself constantly asking this question. I have been on Letterboxd since last year and I could have never anticipated the connections that I have built through this app, the enlightening criticism that I have received from friends, and how addicted I am to recording every movie that I see. Since I was young, I have always looked for a place to put down all of my thoughts about films. I made posts, wrote scattered reviews, and ultimately found my way to Letterboxd — truly the place for every movie lover to go. It has been one of the best ways for me to build relationships with other cinephiles and document my time as a moviegoer.
So without further ado, I will bare a piece of my soul to readers everywhere and reveal my top four films on Letterboxd. They have not changed since I got this app, and I feel as though they ultimately document a deeply personal history of my cinematic interests.
1. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” — dirs. Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert
On April 16, 2022, my life changed as I watched “Everything Everywhere All at Once” for the first time. The rare perfect film, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” magically combines wonderful, heartfelt acting, a story to remember, beautiful cinematography, editing to match, and a score that pulls on your heartstrings. I felt every emotion that day, some in combinations that I didn’t even think possible. I owe The Daniels a debt of gratitude for that mind-blowing experience.
When I think about this film, I cannot help but repeat the words of my first review. Everything Everywhere All at Once reminded me of when I first watched the fight scenes in "Kingsman: The Secret Service" and thought: There are going to be a hundred directors wanting to do the same thing and never be able to pull it off. This movie pulled it off in every way possible.
Since its release last year, I have seen it nearly ten times and have yet to get bored. If this was not ranked as my favorite film of all time, it would be a crime.
2. “Whiplash” — dir. Damien Chazelle
A good ending makes a movie. The ending of “Whiplash” is one that every filmmaker should turn to, gawk at, and try their hardest to replicate. This film knows what it wants to do and achieves it successfully. It is nearly perfect from beginning to end — the lighting accurately matches the tone, the acting is incredible, the plot never drags, and, most of all, the music and visuals are absolutely stunning.
“Whiplash” is so good that it left me feeling breathless. As the film came to a close — the drums building in tempo, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons smiling at each other, and the final note ringing out — my heart swelled and my fingers grew sweaty. I knew that no other film would be able to match the pressure, drive, tempo, and tension that I felt in that moment.
In times of pressure, sadness, anxiety, and stress, I always turn to this film. I play the end sequence over and over again like I am an obsessed drummer trying to learn it from front to back. I have never listened to a score more than the one Justin Hurwitz ’08 created for this film. In fact, it has actually snuck its way into my top five most played songs on Spotify before.
3. “1917” — dir. Sam Mendes
I have never been a fan of war movies, and before I watched “1917,” I did not expect my mind to change. And yet, as soon as I turned this movie on, I was engrossed within the first few minutes. I fell in love with this film not for its content, but for its technical mastery: The film is shot to look like one continuous take. This means that the sets had to be perfect — matched to the exact length and time of the shot — and the sequences timed. For the cast and crew, the rehearsals must have been exhausting.
For me, this film embodies what my art teachers meant when they said, “Any mistake can be turned into a work of art.” The shot with George MacKay running across a field, trying to catch up to the camera after an unscripted fall, contains the artful mistake that inspired me to want to be a filmmaker. Without this film, I would not be writing a review for The Crimson, taking film classes, or obsessed with the intricacies of being on a set. “1917” made me realize how meticulous the process of designing a movie is and how difficult it is to be a director — but most of all, it made me fall in love with the art of cinematography.
4. “Midsommar” — dir. Ari Aster
Picking the right movie for the final spot in my top four was a really difficult choice. I spent a long time thinking about what films have altered how I watch movies and, most importantly, what films have stuck with me the most after watching them.
As it happens, Florence Pugh’s cries have refused to leave my mind since I initially watched “Midsommar” with my dad. I have been a big fan of Ari Aster since his short films on Youtube, including “C’est La Vie” and “Beau.” Therefore, I would be remiss to not acknowledge him as one of my favorite horror movie directors.
When I watched “Midsommar” in theaters, it was the first time I saw people leave and demand their money back. In light of Aster’s new release, “Beau is Afraid,” I recently heard someone say, “A good film should make people walk out of the theater.” When this happens, it means that the film has done its job in making people feel some sort of emotion: happy, sad, disgusted, bored, horrified — although some are terrible emotions, they are feelings nonetheless. “Midsommar” was the first horror film I’ve ever seen that felt like a mix of creepy and comforting. I spent weeks following my first watch wondering why I was smiling and nodding at the end — only a great film can make one do that.

“Feral” doesn’t even begin to cover it. “Feral” is the kind of word used by Gen Z TikTok creators to describe scurrying out of your room at 2 A.M. to scarf down leftover Kraft Mac & Cheese and wallow in your own shame. But in Apollinaire Theatre Company’s production of “Dance Nation,” a play written by Clare Barron and directed by Danielle Fauteux Jacques that runs from April 14 to May 14, “feral” becomes an inadequate, almost cute descriptor for what’s happening onstage. And, as Barron writes, “Cuteness is death.” The play, which follows a group of pre-teen competitive dancers as they plan to win competitions and enact (possibly literal) world domination, is both an animalistic, violent declaration of girlhood, and a sweet, melancholy exploration of what it means to grow old, but never really grow up.
Set in an unspecified town in America, “Dance Nation” follows a group of 13-year-old dancers trying to get to Nationals in Tampa Bay, Florida. The dancers (all girls, except one boy) grapple with puberty, hyper-competitiveness, and the literal monstrosity of growing up. The play focuses on three dancers — Amina (Audrey Johnson), the teacher’s pet; Zuzu (Katie Pickett), earnest but always falling short; and Ashlee (Schanaya Barrows), outspoken and confident — and explores what happens when young people on their own paths inevitably collide.
“Dance Nation” puts these girls’ struggle to gain confidence front and center. Some characters own their sexuality. For example, Ashlee’s monologue starts off with “I think I might be frickin’ gorgeous / My ass, especially / Might be frickin’ gorgeous / I wish I could show you my ass but I’m only 13.”
Moments like these ask the audience: What are 13-year-old girls “allowed” to say or do? Of course, 13-year-olds think about having (or not having) “gorgeous asses.” But is seeing someone say this out loud uncomfortable? Why? Ashlee’s later descriptions of being catcalled feel, perhaps, more familiar. But is it because we are more used to seeing people sexualize young girls than seeing these same girls sexualize themselves?
Exceptional casting is a crucial component of the play’s success. Even though the cast is made up of pre-pubescent dancers, the cast includes a broad range of ages, from young adults to senior citizens. This creates a sense of eerie traversing through time. The audience has the sense that they are watching women (and one man) who grew old, but never grew up. When Zuzu’s mother yells at Dance Teacher Pat (Dev Luthra), the dancers’ demanding coach, for tearing down her daughter’s self-confidence, we see Zuzu, a grown woman, watching her mother try (and fail) to advocate for her. This raises the question: As we age, when do our parents stop fighting for us? When dancers eagerly try to perfect their choreography under Dance Teacher Pat’s criticism or bow their heads in shame when they make a mistake, the audience is left wondering: Does the desire to please others ever go away?
The set, lighting, and sound design are unexcessive and grotesque, evoking demonic liminal spaces and bright competition halls within a seemingly average pink and purple dance studio. On a scale from 1 to 10, sound design dials the stakes up to 11: Epic, soaring vocals and a driving beat reminiscent of Olympics victory music show us that these girls’ goals are writ large in their minds, but that adults are unable to understand their desires for validation through glory.
The attention to detail in costumes is striking. Zuzu wears a dark velvet zip-up jacket with a sunburst of rhinestones — think the Juicy Couture tracksuit craze of the early 2000s. It’s exactly the kind of cutesy, girly, slightly tacky jacket a 13-year-old would love. Touches like these allow characters to inhabit youth without ever feeling like they are wearing a costume, while also pointing to the experience of being a young girl learning to dress yourself (with mixed success).
The play’s themes are best encapsulated in one detail: a cluster of cheap plastic trophies, standing quietly on a shelf. They remain there throughout the show, a not-so-subtle reminder of the pressure placed on the young dancers to be a specific kind of best: Hyper-feminine but nonsexual, immune to things like an unexpected period before a competition or rabid competitiveness that turns your teeth into fangs. In a play where fantastical elements are a way of exploring freedom, the limits of hyper-realism are chilling. When the blood and fangs disappear, are these trophies the only thing that are real? Apollinaire Theatre Company’s production of “Dance Nation” will leave audiences wondering how childhood affects them today, and how monstrosity might just be a form of liberation.

In honor of the end of the semester, here is a selection of the Arts board's favorite comfort shows.
“The Office”
By Arielle C. Frommer, Staff writer
Fewer shows have remained such an important part of pop culture more so than “The Office.” The Emmy-winning sitcom has remained one of television’s most popular comedies since it first aired in 2005, and its scenes, characters, and jokes have been memed, referenced, parodied, and more across the Internet. The show follows the Scranton branch of a paper company and features a unique style of comedy with cleverly timed camera shots, hilarious talking heads, and a meta mockumentary style that breaks the fourth wall.
I immediately fell in love with “The Office” when I discovered it in middle school. Not only were the jokes hilarious, but I loved every character, from the abrasive, clueless Dwight, straight man Jim, girl-next-door Pam, and their slow-burn office romance, and of course the bumbling yet endearing boss Michael Scott. I can always rely on “The Office” whenever I want to have a laugh, with quotable, classic episodes like “Dinner Party” and “Stress Relief.” But really, any episode, although especially those between seasons two and five — undoubtedly the best seasons — can be counted on for an entertaining watch from the cold open right down to end credits.
“Parks and Recreation”
By Julia J. Hynek, Staff Writer
Yeah, “The Office” is great. But what if you had a similar show, except this one had a woman lead and fostered a sense of purpose in the workplace? I raise you “Parks and Recreation.”
“Parks” satirizes not only the politics of government, but also Pawnee City Hall and the Parks office itself. Combining the banality of these circumstances with sharp, witty writing is bound to turn any frown upside-down. One need only turn to stellar episodes like “Hunting Trip,” “Flu Season,” or “Li’l Sebastian” (or really any episode) to make your bad day better.
Perhaps most compelling, however, is “Parks”’s ability to keep alive a sense of pragmatic hope. Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) leads the charge through red tape and bureaucratic nightmares with the biggest heart, and though she can be obnoxious and meddling at times, her irrational persistence is actually quite effective. And it’s also infectious. Viewers watch as the lovable cast of characters develop individually but also as a group, bonded by a sense of purpose, joy, and friendship. From the pilot to the absolutely wonderful, perfect series finale, “Parks and Recreation” will have you laughing, yes, but also feeling a sense of general optimism about the world. And what can be better than that?
“The Vampire Diaries” 
By Allison S. Park, Staff Writer
With a grand total of eight spellbinding seasons and 171 episodes revolving around two vampire brothers (Damon and Stefan Salvatore) chasing Elena Gilbert, a dead ringer for the past love of their lives, I can’t imagine anyone who wouldn’t find “The Vampire Diaries” a comfort TV show. Mysteries of the supernatural combined with romance and drama create for a captivating viewing experience that never gets old. Furthermore, the show’s myriad storylines explore the heart-wrenching backstories of various characters, which causes viewers to experience an internal struggle of either loving or hating the main cast, such as Elena, or villains like Katherine. From my personal experience, this emotional complexity can lead to hours of contemplation and discussion outside of watching the show. The character development throughout the series is also impressive, as we see each character — especially Damon — go through an impressive arc. In addition, if the eight seasons of “The Vampire Diaries” simply weren’t enough, there are also two other spin-offs — “The Originals” and “Legacies” — to binge, which speaks volumes about the baseline widespread popularity of the show. Overall, “The Vampire Diaries” is a timeless classic that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a binge-worthy show to indulge in.
“Never Have I Ever”
By Monique I. Vobecky, Staff Writer
Never have I ever loved a highschool romantic series so much. Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher’s television series “Never Have I Ever” is centered around a first-generation Indian-American teenager, Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), dealing with both the recent death of her father, and fitting in at highschool. Despite having the foundations of a bland Netflix highschool original series, the synopsis transcends the typical template; “Never Have I Ever” brilliantly explores childhood grief and loss, highlighting the complexities of a mother daughter relationship in an immigrant household.
These heavier themes do not weigh the series down, but instead, the series actively compliments these darker scenes with the exploration of young romance and hilariously enjoyable humor. An ever-changing love triangle, zany high-school tropes, and conversations about heritage all make the series light but irrevocably dynamic. Above all, the series’s emphasis on highlighting high-achieving and motivated young women of color is what makes it stand above the rest. For these reasons and many more, I will be excitedly waiting for the fourth and final season of the series to release this summer and will proudly stand by my favorite comfort show, “Never Have I Ever.”
“Doctor Who”
By Alessandro M. Drake, Staff Writer
Whether it’s after a long day of work, a tiring journey, or simply a tough couple of hours, sometimes you just need aliens. And spaceships. And a reincarnating, dual-hearted, British icon, complete with all the shenanigans they pull in tow, is the perfect choice.
Given “Doctor Who”’s run from 1963 to 1989 and later 2005 reboot, it serves as a perfect bridge between multiple generations, and works as an ode to those who enjoy fantastical journeys through space and time — both now and 50 years ago. There’s something heartwarming about people decades apart recognizing that sometimes, you just need to see a man and his friends save the world from evil robots, go visit the French aristocracy, or free a giant space whale.
On the surface, “Doctor Who” is a perfect way to wind down after a hard day: The often theatrical storylines don’t quite take a lot of brain power to follow. But, as viewers quickly learn, it’s a trap! Either you find yourself falling in love with the slow burn, season-long story arcs, or a cast of lovable and quirky characters. “Doctor Who” definitely is an easy comfort show, but on another level, it connects you to the very heart of why we love science fiction in the first place.
“How I Met Your Mother” 
By Hannah E. Gadway, Staff Writer
“How I Met Your Mother” is a show that’s always been there for me. I fell in love with this early-2000s sitcom at a strangely young age and would play episodes on repeat while I slept. As a result, the plot of every episode is permanently ingrained in my consciousness. Want to know the plot of Season 5, Episode 9? No worries; “Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap” is my favorite episode, anyways, and I can give you a rundown at the drop of a hat.
Weird celebrity cameos (why were Katy Perry and Britney Spears in the show?) and toxic Ted Mosby behavior (he’s the literal definition of a “pick me” man) aside, the show is nearly perfect. Watching Neil Patrick Harris play the straightest man alive? Hysterical. Cobie Smulders playing a badass Canadian? Inspiring. The show truly has everything you could want from a sitcom — hilarious situations, a reliable main cast, and tear-jerking moments. Nothing is better than sitting down with somebody that you love to relax with an iconic HIMYM episode.
This show is truly a neverending comfort — as long as you pretend that the last episode doesn’t exist!
“Buffy the Vampire Slayer” 
By Margo A. Silliman, Staff Writer
This show is the epitome of balance. It is a coming-of-age witty teen drama that is the perfect mix of relatability and escapism, humor and drama, and community and individuality. The original premise of the show was to take all of the challenges and angst of high school and depict what would happen if they actually manifested as demons. However, since it spans seven seasons, four of which occur after the main characters graduate from high school, the show also explores the difficulties of college and the dreaded adulthood that follows. Sad that boy won’t call you back? Buffy’s been there. College feeling lonely? Done that. Depression, addiction, identity crisis? All covered. Whenever I feel overwhelmed, an episode pops into my head in which Buffy faces something similar. I go to “Buffy” to feel understood, but stay to feel empowered and distracted from real life. Just when Buffy’s drama feels too real, the actual demons she faces take precedence over her personal demons, transporting the audience into a fantasy world and offering a distraction from the real one for a moment.
Another original theme of the show is to portray the dumb blonde stock character from a horror movie, who normally runs helplessly down an alley from a monster, and instead make her the hero of the story. Though Buffy’s “Scooby Gang” of friends are comforting, there are many plots that involve them doubting her or unable to help her. Even though this can be lonely, this forces her to realize how to defeat antagonists on her own, which often feels more encouraging to me because of the many challenges in life we end up having to face individually. Buffy was created to be a relatable hero, just like the other girls, which makes her all the more inspiring.
“Arrested Development”
By Brady M. Connolly, Staff Writer
I’m not typically the kind of person who enjoys a rewatch. I’ve seen most of my favorite movies and television shows only two or three times. And yet, my reluctance seems to magically fall away in the face of “Arrested Development.” To call this quasi-cult classic of the early 2000s a comfort show would be doing it a disservice. It — and by “it,” I am, of course, only referring to the first three seasons and not the abominable Netflix reboots — is a comedic masterpiece, with each episode boasting a script so full of running gags and subtle punchlines that it is impossible to comprehend them all in one viewing. Every actor and guest star brilliantly elevates the show’s absurdist energy, embodying a strand of Southern California affluenza that generates more comedy than viewers will be able to handle. The late Jessica Walter’s Lucille Bluth is responsible for forming much of my own comedic sensibilities and her unapologetically snobby matriarch ought to be included on every list of television’s greatest performances. And while it would take too long to enumerate the many bits from “Arrested Development” that dominate my consciousness (see Gob’s “BEES!” for the foremost example), in times of trouble, I simply remember one thing: There’s always money in the banana stand.
“The Midnight Gospel”
By Daniel P. Pinckney, Staff Writer
Comfort shows often evoke a sense of childlike nostalgia, shying away from mature content. Yet, Netflix’s “The Midnight Gospel” manages to balance adult concerns with a life-affirming message that all troubles are temporary. Unfortunately canceled after one season, this stellar animated show transported viewers to a new world with each of its eight episodes. The show is built off of interviews between Clancy (Duncan Trussell), and various guests discussing various life-changing experiences. These interviews are brought alive with the unique style it’s co-creator Pendleton Ward used in his hit show “Adventure Time.”
This unique combination creates television that’s more akin to a visual podcast. The show leans into sometimes heavy existential and philosophical themes. Trussell’s uncontained joy as he peers into his guests’ inner worlds, however, prevents its thematic heft from ever dragging the show down. His guests provide powerful testimony about overcoming challenging times in their real lives alongside their animated counterparts — crises of faith, feelings of loneliness, and their impending mortality. Viewers can take comfort that each interviewee navigated their personal ordeal, offering reassurance to viewers that their troubles will work out. The stylistic and eye-catching animation helps to make its heavier themes even more palatable by adding some levity. This reflective show brings with it a meditative respite from the everyday busyness that occupies so much of life.

Madras Dosa Co. Brings a Dose of Dosa to Harvard Square
“Most of us are forgetting that from the beginning of our life, we are approaching death. Life is absurd. But you can fill it with ideas, with enthusiasm. You can fill your life with joy.” —Reinhold Messner, “14 Peaks”
Wednesday nights at the Bondi Beach Backpackers hostel in Sydney, Australia, tend to be a little slow. Nicholas C. Ige ’25 and I opted to spend the warm evening outside, lounging in the courtyard alongside other guests similarly worn out from a full day of surfing. Despite the lack of commotion, I was treated to a now familiar but nevertheless delightful sight when a few of our recent acquaintances in the hostel asked Nick about his life, unsuspecting of the mythic stories awaiting them.
The spectacle began when Nick offered our companions a swig from his bottle of Konyagi. They are first surprised to learn that Konyagi is a local liquor of Tanzania, but they’re even more surprised when Nick explains he was there only the week prior to summit Mount Kilimanjaro. Their bewilderment and wonder only increases when they find out Nick is a Harvard student studying Neuroscience and an army veteran road-tripping along Australia’s coast after climbing the country’s tallest mountain. Not to mention Nick is also a psychedelic enthusiast, savant of consciousness and spirituality, and the meanest surfer Bondi Beach has ever seen.
After taking a moment to digest photos of Nick on deployment in Afghanistan and at Kilimanjaro’s snowy peak, they’re not quite as shocked when he tells them about his plan to become an astronaut one day.
* * *
“No such thing as too many shakas or too many good friends. Good thing I have an abundance of both.” —Nicholas C. Ige ’25
As I reflect now on that night, it seems to so perfectly capture the essence of my time in Australia with Nick. After a few more hours of boisterous discussion with friends made only 24 hours before, our little band of travelers capped off the evening with a quick dip in the ocean, carousing and cavorting as though we had known each other for years. “Happy accidents” and “wholesome hedonism,” as Nick likes to say, were the norm of our stay.
Accidents — some happy, others not so much — have been a consistent theme for Nick since the last installment of my column in November. We made it to Australia, but far less has gone according to the original plan of summiting the tallest mountain on each continent than expected.
To my great personal disappointment — not to mention Nick’s — Kevin Fischetto ’26 sustained an injury while training for their climbing journey. Forced to forgo his winter break travel, the fellow veteran, adventurer, and Nick’s partner in crime has been supporting from the sidelines while embarking on his own journey toward recovery.
So what remains of this project, once centered entirely around friendship?
Perhaps Eli, Nick’s guide in Tanzania, with whom he still exchanges pictures of family and life back home, will tell you that friendship was still very much at the center of Nick’s winter. Yosra and Bo, patrons of a tiny bar in a tiny town along the Australian coast with whom Nick effortlessly struck up conversation, might tell you something similar. In fact, Cybil, Ben, Carly, Lucie, Jacob, Travis, and the dozens of other kind souls Nick touched over break may all be in agreement that friendship finds the man wherever he wanders.

“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one’s little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.” —Mark Twain
In February, I asked Nick to sit down and share details from the first leg of his trip with me. He invited me to flip through his camera roll with him in the “war room” — a small space in the Science Center basement where Nick studies with, of course, his friends. For a few hours, Nick relived the ascent once more with me, swimming through snapshots of peace, quiet, and life at 19,000 feet in our little underground bastion of memory.
The adventure officially began on Dec. 21, when Nick’s flight from Boston touched down in the Kilimanjaro International Airport. The next day, Nick left base camp to begin his ascent. The weight of the journey, however, set in far before he even reached the mountain.
“It’s weird because I’ve spent the majority of my adult life getting off random planes in random countries. I almost have this nostalgic feel,” Nick shared. “I thought my mind would switch into work, but it didn’t. It was like starting off a new adventure where I wasn’t going to war, going to battle. I’m just like, ‘Oh, I’m doing this thing for my own personal mental health.’”
For himself, but also the thousands of veterans who eschew higher education after their service — a reality Nick wants to fight, particularly on social media. Partnered with a supplement brand and featured on several high-profile military community accounts, Nick takes to Instagram to share photos and videos of his veteran experience at Harvard. His following has nearly doubled since he first undertook the project, surpassing more than 7,000 users.
But social media was far from accessible on Kilimanjaro. Walk, eat, sleep, repeat — by the fourth day, mountain life was reduced to basic functions. Hiking was so simple it almost reminded Nick of deployment, where he was entirely removed from the overwhelming decisions of the civilian world, let alone Harvard’s campus.
“Coming home from that, and then having to deal with ‘Where are we going for dinner?’” Nick expressed, pausing to look up from a picture of sunrise on the mountainside. “Every single person [at Harvard] probably has a different goal, and has a different idea of how they’re going to achieve that goal. It’s very complex.”
The album Nick prepared for me also included photos of his tours in Afghanistan, right alongside those from his winter trek. Nick turned his attention back to the sunrise.
“In moments like this, at 6 a.m. on Christmas morning, life is simple.”

“‘We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!’” —J.R.R. Tolkien, “The Hobbit”
Hidden among the clouds, blissfully sitting three miles above the earth in Nick’s photos, is immense pain.
The trek is just getting started, and the summit push is far less friendly than the first few days on the trail would lead you to believe. But Nick isn’t finished showing me his camera roll — pain is only part of the story.
How do we view his mission, then, which is so many things at once? With the grace of a few month’s distance, it seems the trip cannot be presented as anything other than a beautiful assemblage — one of pain, but also friendship, discipline, spontaneity, and a love for life and everything in it. If there is one thing I’ve learned from Nick Ige, perhaps these things are not quite as disparate as one would expect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School professor Erica Chenoweth and their wife Zoe Marks, an HKS lecturer in public policy, will serve as the faculty deans of Pforzheimer House beginning July 1, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in an email to house affiliates Monday.
Chenoweth and Marks — along with their daughter, Vera — will replace outgoing Faculty Deans Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant, who announced last December that they would step down at the end of the academic year after leading the house for a decade.
“Over several conversations during the last several months, I have been struck by Erica’s and Zoe’s warmth and commitment to building a sense of inclusion and belonging in everything they do,” wrote Khurana, a former Cabot House faculty dean. “They are thrilled to be joining the Pfoho community, and I am thrilled to welcome them.”
The pair have been at Harvard since 2018, according to the announcement.
In addition to their appointment at HKS, Chenoweth currently serves as a professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies. Chenoweth studies political violence and directs the Nonviolent Action Lab, which is housed at HKS’ Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and studies movements of nonviolent political action.
Marks researches and teaches topics including conflict and peacebuilding, gender and intersectional inequality, and African politics.
The announcement caps off a monthslong search, led by Khurana, which saw numerous candidates interviewed by current students, house staff, and College administrators.
In March, Pforzheimer Resident Dean Monique A. Roy announced that the search had narrowed to three sets of candidates. Aside from Chenoweth and Marks, the finalists were Physics professor Jennifer E. Hoffman ’00 and Physics researcher Daniel T. Larson ’98 as well as Engineering and Applied Sciences professor Petro Koumoutsakos and Christiane Baumann, a postdoctoral fellow at HKS.
Though the final decision was made by Khurana in consultation with Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean and President-elect Claudine Gay and president Lawrence S. Bacow, students said in interviews that they sought candidates who would foster house spirit and a tight-knit culture.
In a letter of intent for the position, Chenoweth wrote that they saw the position as “one of good stewardship” and would aim to prioritize house community in the role.
“I love talking about ideas and learning from others’ perspectives, and I am drawn to causes greater than myself,” Chenoweth wrote. “I grew up in a multicultural environment where difference and diversity were celebrated, and I’ve always had a heart for justice.”
