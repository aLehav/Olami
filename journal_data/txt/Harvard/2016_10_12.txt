After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Memorial Hall’s tall tower, colorful roof, and intricate stained glass windows make it one of the more eye-catching buildings on campus. Amid the rest of the building’s detail and vibrancy, this outdoor gallery is strikingly calm. The beauty of this passage lies not in the architectural features alone but in the way that those features capture and harness light. The simple silhouette of the gate at the end of the tunnel stands out against a bright arch. Sunlight enters the spaces between the columns, casting dramatic shadows and creating patterns of light and darkness. The result is a quiet and calming space, a break from the colors and textures of the rest of the building.
On the inside, Memorial Hall is as busy as its architectural exterior. Freshmen eat their meals in Annenberg Hall, students attend lecture in Sanders Theatre, and tourists stroll through Memorial Transept. The building is filled with movement and noise as people move from place to place. Yet one can always find a diligent student such as this one, tucked cozily into a corner in the basement beneath Annenberg. This student seems focused singularly on his work, unaware of—or at least unfazed by—the hustle and bustle around him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman
spring, I joined a sorority because I wanted to find community at Harvard.
Besides comp completion “parties”
that involved late-night scavenger hunts and questionable Carly Rae Jepsen
karaoke, the extracurricular activities I had involved myself with during my
first semester of school here didn’t really have a social component. We went to
meetings, discussed business, and left—sometimes spending semesters together,
but never really knowing each other’s names. I had close friends at Harvard,
ones who made me feel warm and loved, but by December they had become elusive,
buried under stacks of p-sets and growing lists of commitments. Gone was the
admissions-tinted glow of fall, when everyone had infinite time to lounge
lazily on cramped common room floors and enjoy each other’s company, intoxicated
by the notion of just being at Harvard.
So when the
spring came, I strapped on my high heels and walked over to the Sheraton Commander
in the bitter cold, begrudgingly subjecting myself to hours of giggly small
talk. Name, dorm, intended concentration: I dispensed this information as
freely as Harvard dispenses condoms during Sex Week. After three days of
smiling, nodding, and making trite quips about Wigglesworth, I received a
golden ticket to an organization that was supposed to be my home—until I realized
it felt too structured, too traditional, and too impersonal.
Then, early this
fall, the punch invites came. Hoping a female final
club would be a more casual,
tight-knit alternative to a sorority, I spent my afternoons dressed in cocktail
casual, my name
prominently displayed on my chest. “PLEASE ACCEPT ME,” my name tag seemed to
say. At each event, I ate finger food and sipped on fruity lemonade. I said my
name, dorm, and intended concentration (again). And finally, after some
searching, I found a community of women whom I felt deeply connected to, and
whom I thought liked me too. But few days after the first round, I received an
email explaining that the club had chosen to cut me. At the time, my blocking
group of five had failed, for the third week in a row, to find time to eat together—something
we had been meaning to do since the first few days of school. So when I got the
email, all of the loneliness that had accumulated over the past few weeks
became unbearable.
Harvard is
an easy place to feel lonely. I could blame it on exclusivity and a lack of
adequate social spaces, and while both things are true, the real issue is
bigger, more all-encompassing. Two weeks ago, I asked two freshmen in my
Statistics office hours how they liked it here and they responded, “I like
Harvard, but people are too busy to hang out with us.” And it’s true. Every
Harvard student seems to be either at a meeting, running to a meeting, or
programming a meeting into their color-coded Google Calendar. It gets tiring
when your primary form of social interaction is a meal, rescheduled three times
until finally, by some miracle, both parties show up.
But the main
problem isn’t even that we’re busy. It’s that we don’t talk to each other. We
convince ourselves that we have the time and energy for yet another
extracurricular commitment, but not for the people in our Government section or
our House or even the room across the hall. Last week I sat down across a
stranger in Adams D-Hall, and he wondered aloud if I was a tutor because “only
tutors sit with strangers.” We had a lovely conversation about his computer
science research, but afterward, I thought about all the times I had entered
the dining hall and, upon seeing none of my friends, hid behind my laptop,
refusing to engage anyone else in conversation. Later that week, at Carpe
Noctem (Adams’ Stein Club), I walked into the Lower Common Room and noticed
everyone standing in stout, impregnable circles. Even Adams, with its endless
teas and study breaks and community-building events, can feel less like a
community and more like an aggregation of blocking groups that happen to live
together.
A lot of times it feels like we as Harvard students don't
care about people outside our immediate core. We need an allegiance to an
established organization and a lengthy selection process to feel connected to
other people. Within the sorority system, it’s perfectly acceptable to reach
out to someone you don’t know for coffee or J.P. Licks. Outside of the sorority
system, less so.
But this
isn’t how it has to be. We don’t have to resign ourselves to four years of
communicating in halfhearted head nods with our entryway-mates or relying on
outside organizations to give us the sense of belonging that we don’t feel like
we have. Maybe I’m an idealist, but I believe that we can make things better.
We can make Harvard feel like a community—a place where we’re not just
individuals with our own isolated struggles, but a group of people who are experiencing
the highs and lows of college together.
So ask
people how their days were, actually. Attend study breaks. Sit with someone new
in the dining hall, even though Annenberg feels like a century ago. Harvard
doesn't always have to feel so lonely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past year has seen a heightened awareness of the reverberations of names on campus. Student activism resulted in the changing of  “House master” to “Faculty Dean." University President Drew G. Faust unveiled a plaque on Wadsworth House honoring the names of four slaves who lived and worked there centuries ago. Law School students occupied a portion of the student center, re-christening it “Belinda Hall” after a slave owned by law school benefactors.
But as Harvard grapples with the names of the past, it is quietly filling the campus with the names of the present.
From the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the T.H. Chan School of Public Health to Danoff Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana and Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, a new generation of names is discreetly trickling into campus.
With the recent revelation that Dean Smith is considering allowing faculty deanships to be named in honor of donors, Harvard might not be stopping at its current lineup. Given that the house renewal phase of the Harvard Campaign is behind schedule, and that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is strapped for liquidity, we understand the particular predicament facing the University.
Still, extenuating circumstances notwithstanding, the University must  weigh the permanence of an endowed title against its short-term need for funds. After all, once these titles have been sold to donors, administrators must search elsewhere for funds. And with the recent lackluster performance of Harvard Management Company, even more pressure to find sustainable sources of income may to weigh on the shoulders of FAS leadership.
Despite the fact that fundraising and endowment performance are not immediately related, both fundraisers and donors are put in a difficult position when HMC is not able to earn a positive return from investing their gifts.
The lasting nature of these titles has other important consequences. When a title is intended to last indefinitely, administrators must make sure the donors from whom it accepts money reflect well upon the University. Though we are not proposing specific criteria for the University to consider, administrators must keep this reality in mind.
Despite our reservations, we are not necessarily opposed to allowing donors to name faculty deanships. Endowed names in the houses are, after all, hardly unprecedented. Eight of Harvard’s houses bear the names of former University presidents and have for centuries. Each house has an Allston Burr Assistant Dean of Harvard College, and many individual house buildings bear the names of donors.
But while we understand the arguments in favor of renaming the faculty deanships and do not wish to dismiss the idea out of hand, the University would do well to remember current debates over names as it undertakes this project. It would be a bitter irony if administrators who have been highly conscious about today’s controversies give birth to tomorrow’s.

To the Editor:
We read with dismay in The Crimson that university officials have been asking for volunteers from the ranks of exempt Harvard employees (employees not paid hourly and ineligible for overtime pay) to staff the dining halls during the strike.
There is room for disagreement on the issues between the administration and the union, but this tactic for defeating the strike is beyond the pale.  It should stop.
The potential for coercion seems obvious.  Coercion can be subtle, especially for staff workers who are concerned about their own job security or promotion and therefore want to please their bosses.  Even apart from the issue of coercion, bringing in volunteers from across the university is very different from having dining-hall managers get their hands dirty (so to speak—we hope not in fact).  Asking people to come in from other parts of the university is an escalation comparable to a situation in which the union might intimidate people in the process of their crossing picket lines.  Neither amounts to acceptable behavior.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, while I was in the dining hall furiously battling a paper deadline, I overheard someone say, in good humor, that once you get into Harvard, you never stop applying, auditioning, or comping for things. Sheepishly, I glanced at my laptop screen and the minimized window of an application due that very night.  
Whoever you are, you perceptive, random person from my dining hall­—thank you for making me reconsider why I was writing that six-page application.
Harvard’s environment is competitive. Whether this has to do with the student body’s abundance of ambition or students’ constant need to prove themselves, I’m not sure. The fact that we consider this competitiveness to be normal is disturbing. When we arrive on campus, one of the first things we get is a booklet that says "Comp Harvard." From that point onwards, we assume that comping clubs all the time is simply characteristic of a place like Harvard. We accept it without much questioning.
Is it normal on our campus? Yes. Should it be? No. Everything from joining social spaces such as final clubs or Greek organizations, to trying out new activities, to applying to classes can require some form of an application. But there are better ways to gauge one’s interest or ability when it comes to accessing these spaces.
Harvard has over 400 student groups, which offer an immense range of opportunities for students to explore old and new interests alike. However, having an application system may discourage newcomers from joining, because they are time-consuming and often challenging, which deters students from filling them out. The fear of rejection is as real for activities as it is for anything else. When trying out for new experiences, even if a club is open to everyone, students who have prior experience in the area hold a comparative advantage over newcomers, thus leaving room only for newcomers with astounding raw talent. But, what about the students that are looking to try something new? Not everyone is naturally endowed with talent in Mock Trial or boasts business acumen. But they could if they could access the experience and training, they could reach that point.
In high school, I had the chance to pursue things I’d never done before. But college implicitly demands that prior knowledge we bring from high school.  If you want to try something new, but know someone with experience will be given precedence over you, why bother playing an uneven field? Even if one could potentially flourish in a particular group or activity, once they’ve gained some experience, one may never get the chance. Further still, as an international, I often find that I haven’t experienced many of the activities that Harvard offers prior to coming here, because my country either didn’t teach those skills or did so in a different way. For example, the debates system in the U.S. is starkly different from what I was used to. In these cases, American students have a comparative advantage over international students; and if a club can only accept a certain number of members, then international students may never make the cut or get the chance to explore new interests. This may also lead to increased stress levels for students, who not only have to worry about academic performance, but also performance in activities.
While some of these application processes have become less intense, there is still much to be done to encourage a healthier extracurricular atmosphere on campus. The open-comps of student organizations such as the Harvard Political Review and the Harvard International Review  is a great example of a manageable and inviting process. This encourages students to pursue their interests in writing, even if they have no relevant experience. In the arts, Harvard Ballroom Dancing and the Noteables are non-audition groups that allow students to explore their interests in dance and music without necessitating any prior instruction. All of these organizations emphasize training, helping students improve their skills or even build them from scratch. I hope other organizations also follow suit.
Extracurricular activities should provide students with an outlet to do what they love or what interests them without the pressure of requiring mastery. Just as people in the real world pursue hobbies simply by devoting consistent energy and  enthusiasm, students should be able to do the same and feel welcomed in any field. Student organizations need to reevaluate how conducive they are for beginners, and whether they can improve on that. Though they exist, more inclusive groups need to be funded and advertise on this campus—groups that do not grant entry based on auditions or trials but instead foster unadulterated, no-stress love for expanding our horizons. Who knows where someone might find their niche?

With midterm season in full swing and more than a month of class under our belts, many of us are stressed. How can we stay calm and focused? Ellen J. Langer, the Harvard Psychology department’s first female tenured professor, is an expert on mindfulness. We discussed how to channel creativity, handle stress, and rethink unhealthy assumptions.
Fifteen Minutes: How did you get involved in mindfulness research?
Ellen J. Langer: While I was a graduate student at Yale, I did several studies that paved the way for the eventual work on mindlessness and mindfulness. One study I did was where we showed a video clip to clinicians and the person on the videotape was either called a job applicant or a patient. It was the exact same video tape. However, people’s responses varied enormously, depending on the label. When he was called the patient they saw him as sick, essentially, when he was a job applicant he was seen as fairly well adjusted. That was an early sign that labels guide most of our thinking, and we don’t include in that thinking information that’s discrepant with the label.
After we had done a few studies on mindfulness, I became aware of all of the Buddhist literature, which I found exciting, that there was a long history of coming to the same conclusions. So my work from the Western scientific perspective was lining up nicely with work coming from an Eastern philosophical tradition. Essentially, the mindfulness as we study it is a simple process of noticing new things. We don’t need meditation; meditation is just a tool to get you to post-meditative mindfulness.
FM: What draws you to this type of research?
EL: The application of these results is clear, so the feeling that by doing this work we are [not only] answering theoretical questions, but also setting the stage for potentially large impact on people’s health and well-being, is highly motivating.
FM: Has your perception or definition of mindfulness changed over the years that you have been researching?
EL: No, oddly. I started off… with the realization of the importance of choice. When you’re making choices, you’re noticing differences among outcomes. So that’s where I started and that’s where I am now. I think that my understanding of the concept has grown in many ways, but not a fundamental change in definition.
What’s clear to me is that the culprit in most of the problems that face us is our illusion of certainty. And what happens is when you’re certain, you don’t pay attention any longer. And it’s that belief that we know that keeps us from recognizing things that could work to our advantage. Everything is always changing, everything looks different from different perspectives. So what we do is confuse the stability of our mindsets with the stability of the underlying phenomenon. And once we start noticing new things, we see the things we thought we knew well, we don’t really know, and then our attention naturally goes to it.
FM: Do you have any advice for the students here, or your college-age self?
EL: Stress is not a function of events. When you’re stressed, the reason you’re stressed is that you believe something is going to happen and when it happens, it’s going to be awful. You want to open up both parts of that. First, the belief that it’s necessarily going to happen. We think we can predict, because we’re so good at looking back and saying we should’ve, could’ve known. But going forward, it’s much different. Say to yourself, this event that you’re sure is going to happen, what are three or five ways that you believe that it might not happen? You’ve gone from thinking that it’s definitely going to happen to now maybe it’ll happen, maybe it won’t. So you immediately feel better.
Then say to yourself, let’s assume that it does happen. What are three or five ways that it might actually be a blessing in disguise? And by doing that, much of the stress that we experience dissipates. There’s a one-liner that I had in my book, “The Art of Noticing”: “Is it a tragedy or is it an inconvenience?” Most of the things that we get ourselves all worried about are at best inconveniences, not tragedies.

Clinking champagne glasses reverberated around University Hall’s Faculty Room as Economics professor Oliver Hart’s colleagues, friends, and family gathered Tuesday afternoon to celebrate the announcement of his joint Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.
Hart and MIT professor Bengt R. Holmström will receive the award for their contributions to contract theory.
After a welcome by Economics Department Chair David I. Laibson ’88, University President Drew G. Faust spoke briefly about Hart’s accomplishment.
“[Hart’s] impact across Harvard is something to celebrate,” she said. Fellow administrators Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 also attended the reception.
Over the next 40 minutes, a handful of Hart’s colleagues praised his life, work, and influence.  The celebration concluded with a speech by Hart himself, in which he expressed gratitude and praised the University and his department.
“I felt from the moment I arrived that it was a really lovely place,” he said. “What seemed different here was the way people relate to each other.”
Hart added that Harvard must continue supporting the Economics department.
“It’s true that we face some challenges,” he said. “We like to think of ourselves as the best Economics department, and I think there was a period when we clearly were. I think that’s less clear now.”
In recent years, several members of Harvard’s Economics department have left for other institutions, including Stanford University.
During speeches from Hart’s colleagues, Economics professor and fellow Nobel laureate Eric S. Maskin ’72 discussed Hart’s academic work on contract theory and shared anecdotes about his long-time friend. According to Maskin, Hart and Hart’s wife, Comparative Literature Lecturer Rita Goldberg, performed a hip-hop duet at their oldest son’s bar mitzvah.
Economics professor Pol Antràs reflected on how Hart’s leadership played an important role in his development in academia. Antràs worked with Hart while completing his PhD at Harvard. He said receiving a job offer from Hart, then-chairman of the Economics department, was a special moment.
“He’s always been approachable, kind, supportive,” Antràs said. “His intellectual integrity and depth are a constant source of awe and inspiration for me.”
Like Antràs, Economics professor Andrei Shleifer worked with Hart while completing his graduate degree. Taking a more humorous tone, Shliefer said Hart’s defining characteristics include his deliberate thought, occasional grumpiness, and sense of humor.
In the short time between the notification of Hart’s award and the reception, Hart said his life has already intensified.
“I woke up this morning and by 9 a.m. I was already feeling tired…. I can live with it,” he joked.

Kendra K. Albert, an affiliate of Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, urged audience members at a Harvard Law School event Tuesday to examine critically the use of legal terminology in casual settings outside the court of law.
Albert defined these “legal talismans” as “a legal term of art, out of place, invoked to make or justify substantive decisions that do not involve formal legal processes.”
Albert, a 2016 Law School graduate, cited free speech and defamation as two examples of terms that individuals and organizations frequently cite outside legal contexts to defend their non-legal decisions. They added that the use of "legal talismans" leads individuals to lose sight of the often discriminatory history of the laws they are casually referencing.
“Defamation’s gorgeous traditional design hides deeply sexist, racist, and whorephobic, which means ‘anti-sex worker,’ connotations,” Albert said.
Albert, who uses the gender pronoun "they," explained that, historically, laws have criminalized calling a woman an adulterer, a straight person gay, and a white person black as defamation.
According to Albert, when individuals casually reference these legal principles now, they are unaware of these concepts’ prejudicial histories.
“The law is not some neutral force that we can reach out to and we can pull into our terms of service or our online spaces without bringing with it its long, long history of oppressing the oppressed,” Albert said.
“The power of the words is what makes them dangerous,” they said. “The fact that [these terms] feel neutral is what means that we should give them a second look.”
Anne Bellon, a visiting PhD student, praised Albert’s efforts to expose biases that are associated with commonly cited legal principles.
“I really liked when [Albert] started to unpack all these cultural meanings behind the terms ‘defamation’ or even ‘free speech,’ that there was a sexist bias, a racist bias behind those legal terms that you use constantly,” Bellon said.
Ron Newman, another member of the audience, liked Albert’s explanation of the history of defamation and free speech law.
“[The presentation] peeled back the history behind terms that we use everyday without really thinking about what they mean and where they came from,” he said.
Prior to diving into the history of "legal talismans," Albert expressed support for the ongoing strike by Harvard University Dining Services workers.
“I want to just take a moment to express solidarity with the folks who are protesting outside,” Albert said. “It’s important to me to make sure that folks know that even though I’m in here giving a talk instead of standing outside with them, I stand in solidarity with them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some students are working to maintain environmental sustainability after dining hall workers began their strike and porcelain plates were replaced with disposable ware.
Since the start of Harvard dining workers’ historic strike, the normal washable dishes and silverware in the dining halls have been replaced with plastic and cardboard substitutes. In many houses, the student Resource Efficiency Program representatives have sent out emails to remind students to be conscious about recycling and sustainability during the strike.
Benjamin D. Grimm ’18, who was a REP in Kirkland House last year, said the waste system was unorganized the first day of the strike but has since improved. Many Kirkland residents ate their meals in neighboring Eliot after Harvard closed Kirkland's dining hall—among other upperclassman dining halls—to consolidate resources.
“The first day was a little crazy, there were a bunch of different unlabeled waste bins and people were sort of indiscriminately throwing things into them,” Grimm said. “A lot of students didn’t know the nuances, and there was no labeling.”
After the first night, he said the Eliot REPs put out signs to clearly indicate which bins are for compost, recycling, and trash. The signs even specify which items should go in each bin. Aldis Elfarsdottir ’18 coordinated with dining managers and staff in Eliot “to facilitate the separation of compostables and recyclables for the duration of the strike,” according to an email she wrote.
As it stands, many of the Houses with open dining halls are currently separating trash, recycling, and compost. Clean plastic plates and cups can be recycled, but the plastic utensils are neither recyclable nor compostable, and so have to be thrown in the trash.
Last Thursday, Currier switched to only compostable dining ware, Faculty Dean Latanya Sweeney wrote in an email to students. Tuesday, upon being reopened to students, Kirkland dining hall switched to compostable plates, utensils, and soup cups, according to Grimm.
Looking forward, Grimm said if the strike continues and the dining halls run out of plastic silverware, stocking all houses with compostable cutlery would be the best option.
Colin B. Durrant, a spokesperson for the Office of Sustainability, wrote in an emailed statement that “the REP students have been working very hard within the houses and dining halls to ensure that waste reduction practices, including recycling and composting, are implemented as much as is practically possible during the strike.”

When N.P. “Narv” Narvekar arrives in Boston in December to take the reins of Harvard Management Company—and the $35.7 billion endowment it controls—he won’t be trading the life of a Wall Street banker and New York financier for a low-stress academic job.
Instead, he’ll come to the helm of the largest university endowment in the world during a time of turmoil and repeated underperformance. Harvard’s investment returns have consistently trailed those of its peers in the last few years, drawing the concern of administrators including University President Drew G. Faust. In fiscal year 2016 alone, the endowment’s value plunged almost $2 billion amidst negative investment returns and more than $1.7 billion HMC paid out to fund University operations.
So when Narvekar does arrive in Cambridge, experts say, he’ll have his work cut out for him, and he’ll face a number of questions and tests.
Should Harvard ends its long-standing “hybrid investment model,” in which the University both employs an in-house investment staff and retains outside firms to invest University funds, and transition to an external model like the one in place at the endowment he previously led at Columbia University?
Should it stick with its investments in risky alternative assets, like private equity and real estate, or move towards a safer, more traditional mix of stocks and bonds?
Can he bring stability to HMC as its fourth CEO in 10 years, a rate of executive turnover several experts have said undercuts HMC’s ability to set effective strategy?
And can he make HMC, long the envy of the university endowment world, once again one of the preeminent institutional investors in higher education?
Narvekar’s track record at Columbia could provide clues to his future at HMC. In particular, experts say his hiring could portend the end of the “hybrid model” at HMC and the introduction of an external investment model akin to what Narvekar had in place at Columbia. And it could mark a further shift towards alternative assets in HMC’s investment portfolio.
“It’s an interesting situation in that there are these choices about how much of the legacy of the past to retain, and how much to change or potentially jettison,” said William F. Jarvis, the executive director of the Commonfund Institute, an asset management firm for non-profit institutions.

At Harvard, Narvekar will run an endowment roughly four times the size of Columbia’s—and a team over 10 times as large. The Columbia Investment Management Company’s website lists a lean team of 20 employees. HMC, by contrast, employs more than 200.
That could change, though, if Narvekar decides to have HMC rely more heavily on external managers.
“I think it’s very obvious that the number one priority is to stabilize Harvard Management Company,” said Tim J. Keating ’85, the president of Keating Wealth Management. “And the stabilization should be a consequence of deciding what model Harvard Management Company is going to use, meaning either external, à la Yale, or the current hybrid model.”
Harvard’s recent investment performance has made some University leaders, including Faust, wonder if it should end its “hybrid model.” It has not kept pace with the growth at many of its peer universities, including Columbia, which returned negative 0.9 percent in fiscal year 2016 to Harvard’s negative 2 percent. Indeed, every year since the financial crisis, Columbia’s endowment has grown at a faster rate than Harvard’s.
Harvard has recently taken strides to cut down its in-house staff, reducing the size of its lagging internal public equity team and moving most of the investments to outside managers last June. Leaving the possibility for future outsourcing open, Faust said in a September interview that internal versus external hiring will be decided “on the basis of where we can do the best investing.”
Dismantling Harvard’s sizeable internal team, though, would materially mean layoffs at HMC’s Boston office.
“It really depends on whether he tries to make the Harvard portfolio look more like Columbia’s, and if he does, then yes, you would probably see fewer people working at the Harvard Management Company,” New York University finance professor David L. Yermack ’85 said.

Narvekar began his career in institutional investing as the head of private equity and hedge fund portfolios at the University of Pennsylvania. His specialty in alternative assets—like private equity, hedge funds, and real estate—has characterized much of his career, experts say, and could begin a shift towards heavier investments in that asset class at HMC.
In fiscal year 2014, the last year for which Columbia released detailed information about its investment portfolio, 21 percent of Columbia’s investments were in private equity, compared to 16 percent of Harvard’s portfolio during the same time period. For some experts, this reliance on illiquid investments like private equity can be risky.
“If he manages the Harvard endowment anything like at Columbia, you’ll see much less investment in the stock and bond market, much more in these illiquid investments,” Yermack said. “So fasten your seatbelts.”
Narvekar’s strong background in private equity, though, could equip HMC to succeed in the asset class. During the financial crisis, Harvard’s extensive illiquid holdings in asset classes like private equity led to a liquidity crisis and spending cuts across the University.
“He seems to be able to pick good outside managers, particularly in the private equity area,” said Charles A. Skorina, who manages a firm that recruits financial executives. “And Harvard’s had a lot of problems in private equity.”

If Narvekar has plans for HMC, for now, he isn’t telling. He declined to comment for this story via a spokesperson at Columbia.
But with his reputation as an even-keeled and fastidious investor, Narvekar won’t make any changes in haste, said Roger B. Kafker, a managing director at private equity firm TA Investments. Kafker attended Haverford College with Narvekar and later worked with him on Haverford’s investment committee.
“Narv is a quiet, thoughtful, very analytical person,” Kafker said. “You wouldn’t expect him to react very dramatically to any good news or any bad news. He would take it in and digest it and then give you a thoughtful response.”
Kafker added that he expects Narvekar, despite his private equity background, to position the portfolio “pretty conservatively.”
And with HMC searching for executive stability after a series of short stints at the helm, Kafker said Narvekar is likely to make a longer-term commitment.
“I think Narv, in making a move as important as this, would view it as a long term investment of his time and resources,” he said. “It’s not something he would do without a lot of thought of spending many years working on Harvard’s endowment.”
And when Harvard’s investment priority is to fund University operations for eternity, Narvekar will have plenty of time.
“For a large complex endowment such at Harvard—at all Ivy League schools, but particularly Harvard— making changes is not something that can be done quickly,” Jarvis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the presidential election approaching, many College students from outside Massachusetts are taking advantage of absentee ballots to participate in their home state’s local politics.
Students who are not from the Bay State are faced with voting options: re-registering to vote in Massachusetts, or voting absentee in their home state. Many of them said voting at home, rather than re-registering to vote in Massachusetts as state law allows, has a special importance.
North Carolina native Caroline M. Tervo ’18 said staying involved with local and state politics is very important, especially with a series of important elections coming up—from the gubernatorial race to her local school board.
“I couldn’t imagine voting in Massachusetts because I have such a stake in what happens to North Carolina public schools,” she said.
Different states have varying absentee voting practices. While some states require an excuse to vote absentee, ranging from illness to employment, most do not. The majority of states have a deadline for absentee ballot applications, and some recommend applying at least a month in advance of election day.
Some students feel compelled to vote in swing states if they can, like Victor C. Agbafe, Jr. ’19, also from North Carolina. Polling averages for Democrat Hillary R. Clinton and Republican Donald J. Trump have been within a percentage point of each other for much of the campaign in that state.
“I think every vote counts, not only at the national level, in terms of where those electoral votes are going to go, but also at the state level,” he said.
Absentee voters at Harvard, however, have had a range of experiences in registering. Some students noted minor inefficiencies with the registration process.
Tervo said that, although she has already sent in her absentee ballot request, she has not received her ballot yet due to a new voter ID law in her home state, which changed the identifications required.
Texas resident Marissa Rodriguez ’19 noted that the process was not as easy as in-person voting.
“You have to make sure you have your paperwork submitted so you can receive your ballot before the deadline,” she said. “It’s trivial, but you have to pay for your stamp and go through the extra effort of paperwork.”
Others had no trouble registering at all in their home state.
Evan C. MacKay ’19, an absentee voter from Florida, said the registration process had been smooth, despite switching party registration twice.

Returning to his alma mater, former Massachusetts Governor and now Libertarian Party Vice Presidential nominee William F. “Bill” Weld ’66 projected confidence regarding his ticket’s long-shot bid for the White House.
“I think the Libertarian option seems really appealing,” Weld said, reflecting on the dissatisfaction that many voters have with the current slate of major party candidates. “Libertarians are the foremost option that many people are turning to.”
Weld, who is running on the Libertarian ticket headed by former New Mexico Governor Gary E. Johnson, spoke at Harvard Tuesday evening at an event sponsored by the Harvard Republican Club. The student group made headlines over the summer for not endorsing the Republican presidential nominee—businessman and reality show star Donald J. Trump—for the first time in the group’s history, and a straw poll of the club’s membership found a plurality of members supported Johnson.
While acknowledging Johnson was not likely to win the presidency outright, Weld said the Libertarian ticket could emerge victorious if election night ended in a split vote of the Electoral College, throwing the election to the House of Representatives where Johnson could emerge as the consensus candidate.
According to Weld, the Libertarian ticket is appealing because it would bring a unique ability to reach across the aisle and a bold plan to balance the budget.
“I think we’d be a long, cool glass of water. We would have the best of the Republican Party and the best of the Democratic Party in our administration,” he said. “Cut taxes, reduce government spending, and reduce the deficit. That’s our plan.”
The speech was followed by a question and answer session, where Weld faced some friendly fire over a gaffe from his running mate. When asked about Johnson’s recent inability to identify the besieged Syrian city of Aleppo, Weld responded, “[Johnson] thought Aleppo was an acronym…Pop quizzes on TV are not Gary’s strong suit.”
Despite that slip-up, which drew headlines, Weld said overall both he and Johnson have enjoyed being on the campaign trail.
“We really haven’t looked back,” he said, laughing. “It’s been pure joy.”
Harvard Republican Club President Declan P. Garvey ’17 said he was excited to host Weld, especially with many Republican Club members looking for alternative candidates to support this cycle.
“We’re exploring our different options,” Garvey said. “We’re bringing him here because he was a very successful Republican governor of Massachusetts.”
However, Weld’s visit was not all political. For a while, he talked about his own memories from his time as an undergraduate at Harvard.
“I used to have a lot of classes in Emerson and Sever and I used to take a nap at 1:40. I had a 2:00 class. Harvard time…that’s a really good thing,” Weld said, referring to the classroom buildings in Harvard Yard and the fact that Harvard classes typically start seven minutes after their scheduled time.
The roughly 75-member audience greeted Weld with applause and laughter on multiple occasions, sometimes cheering at his proposals. Many stopped to take pictures with him and ask him additional policy questions after the discussion was over. Weld was happy to oblige, even asking people with questions to come down to the front.
“I thought it was very interesting,” attendee Ninos Mansor said. “Not surprising that he studied at Harvard.”
Other attendees said they found the talk interesting, with many saying they wished Weld was at the top of the Libertarian ticket.
“He’s definitely much more polished,” Mansor added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 19, 2016, at 3:32 p.m.
With the historic Harvard University Dining Services strike stretching into its seventh day, HUDS employees say they remain committed to their cause despite increasing personal financial pressures.
During normal operations, HUDS workers make $21.89 per hour on average. For the duration of the strike, however, workers will receive $40 a day from UNITE HERE Local 26’s strike fund, according to Local 26 president Brian Lang. Local 26 is the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining workers. 
On Tuesday, HUDS employees protesting outside the Harvard Faculty Club said adjusting to the dramatic decrease in pay has been difficult. John J. Arredondo, a HUDS employee who typically works at the Faculty Club, said the steep reduction in pay accompanying the strike has been hard for protesters “as a group,” although the union’s $40 was “more than what we expected.”
Michael Kramer, Local 26’s lead negotiator, said he was well aware of striking workers’ anxiety.
“Of course people are concerned about being on strike,” he said. “It’s a scary and challenging situation.”
Perhaps adding to their concerns, strikers have yet to actually receive Local 26’s pledged $40, according to Arredondo. He added that workers will begin to garner strike wages from Local 26 soon, noting that the union’s promise to pay striking workers is “coming into effect now.”
Nonetheless, both Arredondo and Angel D. Hernandez, another HUDS worker normally stationed at the Faculty Club, said their commitment to the strike remained strong in spite of financial stresses.
“I think that we’re going to stay as long as it takes,” Hernandez said. “Whether we’re struggling or not, we’re fighting for a cause, and I think we need that cause.”
“We’re here to stay,” Arredondo added.
While protesting outside Annenberg dining hall on Tuesday, Kerry E. Maiato, a HUDS employee who said he is typically stationed in Annenberg, echoed Hernandez and Arredondo’s sentiments.
“When you’re on strike, it’s all about sacrifice for the greater good of the end result, and that’s the way we all feel,” Maiato said. “Of course, it’s affecting a lot of the members as it is myself, we’re not getting paid the same amount, but like I said it’s a sacrifice. We have to do it so we can get what’s fair to us.”
Kramer said HUDS workers intend to strike until their demands are met and that he considers the strike indefinitely sustainable.
“The [only] thing that is unsustainable is the status quo,”  he said.
In addition to worsening their personal fiscal troubles, HUDS workers said they fear the strike is negatively impacting College students by decreasing the quality of dining hall food.
“They got raw chicken,” Arrendondo said, referencing pictures of under-prepared dining hall chicken that the Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate group spearheading student efforts to support the strike, circulated online over the weekend. “[The food] is gonna kill these students.”
Arredondo said he and other employees wanted to “get back to work” to help rectify the situation. Hernandez, too, expressed a desire to return to the dining halls.
“The students are getting lousy meals right now. Plastic in their food, aluminum foil in their chicken, meat in the banana bread pudding,” Hernandez said. “I can’t wait [to get back to work].”

On Tuesday night, the Harvard women’s soccer team took a break from its Ivy League slate to take on Boston University at Jordan Field.
Although the matchup had no conference implications—and although the Crimson didn’t even come up with the victory—Harvard (7-3-2, 2-0-1 Ivy) turned in one of the best performances of the season, peppering the Terriers (4-10-1, 4-1-0 Patriot) with 27 shots en route to a 2-2 tie in double overtime.
“We really took the game to Boston University and created numerous chances,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “The result isn’t necessarily what we wanted it to be—but the performance was fantastic, one of our better performances of the year.”
The Midge Purce-Rachel Garcia connection was on full display on Tuesday night, as Garcia assisted Purce on a through ball in the 48th minute, which was then followed by Purce’s assist to Garcia in the 67th minute to complete the Crimson’s scoring.
The two senior forwards have been offensive producers all season long. Purce now has an Ivy-leading 10 goals and three assists on the year, while Garcia moves to three goals and three assists.
The most outstanding features of the home team’s performance, however, were the ease with which Harvard twice erased one-goal deficits and then went on to dominate the overtime periods without allowing a single shot.
“Although we went down on two occasions today, I always felt that we were the favorite team to win the game,” Hamblin said. “That’s the way the players believed and played.”
The Terriers got on the board first with a 20th-minute goal from freshman forward Kelly Park. After Purce tied the game in the 48th minute, the visitors regained the 2-1 lead in the 64th minute off a set-piece goal by freshman defender Shannon Keefe.
The Crimson responded quickly by knotting the game back up at two goals apiece less than four minutes later.
“Over the last few weeks, I think we’ve proven that we can go down a goal, and we don’t get flustered,” Hamblin said. “I don’t think it really impacts us. We don’t overanalyze it—we just go in and keep doing our job.”
The home team’s momentum carried into the overtime periods, in which it outshot BU 8-0. Despite the constant pressure, and despite the several game-winning opportunities that Harvard created in overtime, the Crimson couldn’t get over the final hump.
“I think [overtime] was a testament to the group’s desire to go on and win the game,” Hamblin said. “Obviously, at that point, both teams are tired, but our players showed that we wanted it.”
Purce ended up outshooting the entire BU team, as she tallied 14 shots over the Terriers’ collective 11.
On the BU side, the team was credited with two team saves, as position players twice cleared the ball off the goal line to keep the visitors alive. With help from her team, Terrier senior goalkeeper Bridget Conway continued her shutout streak, in which she hasn’t allowed a goal since a Bucknell matchup on September 18, five games ago.
With Harvard’s primary and senior goalie Lizzie Durack resting, sophomore Danielle Etzel made five saves and was credited with the tie. Freshman Kat Hess came on for the second half and also manned the pipes during both overtimes.
The Crimson also took 12 corner shots in comparison to BU’s two. Harvard benefited from contributions from every individual—even those without regular playing time—in its final non-conference game.
“We wanted to give players the opportunity to step in today and show what they can do,” Hamblin said. “We really didn’t miss a beat. I was really proud of the entire group today.”
The Crimson has played two double-overtime draws in a row to add to its seven-game unbeaten streak. Harvard now travels to Brown on Saturday, its third game in the span of a week.
With Columbia playing a nonconference game on Tuesday night as well, Harvard stands pat at two points behind Columbia atop the Ivy League standings with four games left on the schedule. Purce, Durack, Garcia, and the rest of the senior class will be searching for their third title in four years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many college soccer teams like to claim that they are deep—that they rely on a wealth of different players to score goals, record shutouts, and ultimately win games.
This kind of talk sounds nice. But what sounds nicer, and what actually matters at the end of the season, is whether squads can substantiate pregame platitudes with in-game performance.
Last night against crosstown rival Boston College, Harvard (6-3-2, 1-0-1 Ivy) accomplished just this feat. The Crimson earned a hard-fought 2-0 win at Newton Campus Field thanks to early goals from freshman midfielder Taner Dogan and junior forward Tyler Savitsky. Neither of those players had recorded a score this season.
The win extended a five-game unbeaten streak and kicked off an extended road stretch that will last until November. More than that, the performance answered that eternal nagging question: So really, how deep is Harvard?
The answer, at least according to one night’s box score, is that not many teams are deeper.
“It was a good win for us,” senior defender Alex Leondis said. “It’s always a big game when we play BC. I thought we did really well. We came out, we scored a goal in the first 5 minutes. Our mentality throughout the entire 90 minutes was the same, and we fought every minute from the first until the last.”
Coming into the game, Harvard anticipated facing a strong BC team that had played against top programs in the country and hung tough. But the Crimson had an impressive track record of its own, having come posted a dominant victory against Cornell this past weekend.
The visitors’ momentum and confidence continued into Tuesday’s game, as Harvard started out strong. Dogan set the tone for the Crimson attack right from the starting whistle, taking Harvard’s first shot on goal.
Although BC’s Cedric Saladin saved the shot, sending the ball out of bounds, Dogan found another opportunity moments later. Junior defender Justin Crichlow found Dogan off a throw-in, and Dogan found the back of the net, giving Harvard a 1-0 lead just over three minutes into the game.
“Anytime you get an early goal takes a little pressure off because the other team has to chase,” Leondis said. “We focus on what we do and not so much who we’re playing, and every time we get the early goal, it kind of helps us and lifts us a little bit more.”
BC responded with renewed intensity but only managed to pick up a pair of fouls to respond to Harvard’s early lead.
Seventeen minutes after Dogan’s goal, sophomore forward Cesar Farias slid a pass into someone who had previously played behind him—Savitsky. Once an outside back, the junior had moved to midfield after an injury during a match against Yale.
Now thanks to this new position, Savitzky was at the top of the box with the ball and a window of opportunity for a shot. The converted back sent the ball forward past BC’s Saladin for a two-score lead.
“It was my first time getting up at midfield in a while,” Savitzky said. “It felt really good to make an impact and help the team.”
Once again, BC responded with a quick attack. In the next few minutes following Savitzky’s goal, the Eagles soared to the attacking third, taking two shots. Harvard, determined to hold onto its comfortable lead, maintained a tight defense and refused to yield any goals for the rest of the half.
The second part of the game shifted definitively to the Crimson’s defensive efforts. While the visitors ended the half leading BC in shots taken, Harvard trailed in the second half.
BC came out with offense on its mind, and in the first 20 minutes, the Eagles found multiple shot opportunities. While BC’s heightened attack provided opportunities, these opportunities generally proved inaccurate, with many shots going high or wide.
The second half also turned scrappy, with both teams fighting hard and thereby picking up multiple fouls and even a couple of yellow cards.
Ultimately, however, the Crimson stood tall, outlasting the Eagles and pulling out the shutout win.
“BC is a really well regarded and a really strong team,” Savitsky said. “To be able to go into their place and...actually beat them builds a lot of confidence in us. Hopefully we just keep that momentum into the next game this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 20th minute of last Saturday’s match between the Harvard men’s soccer team and visiting Cornell, senior forward Jake Freeman chased down a deep lob pass over the Big Red (0-9-2, 0-2-0 Ivy) back line and finished emphatically to aid the Crimson (5-3-2, 1-0-1) in its eventual 4-0 victory.
The play started when Harvard junior midfielder Christian Sady regained possession after a Cornell clear and sent a crafty chip pass over the Big Red’s flat back four. Freeman sprinted after the ball and controlled it nicely off his chest before flicking it over Cornell goalie Ryan Shellow for the 2-0 cushion lead.
“I saw the spacing behind with [Cornell’s] high line,” Freeman recalled. “[Sady] is going to put the ball on a platter for me like he always does, and it was just my job to take a touch down to the finish.”
Freeman had already tallied points by the time his shot rolled across the goal line, as he assisted on sophomore forward Cesar Farias’s third-minute goal. Freeman, a Melville, NY, native, pitched in with his second goal of the evening in the 69th minute when, off a long throw-in, he came crashing into the box and buried a bouncing ball, completing his five-point night.
As Harvard’s scoring leader for the 2015 campaign, Freeman finds himself in a somewhat unsurprising position: He sits atop the Ancient Eight in points with 16, already flirting with the 17 points he amassed last season. Further, the 2015 All-Ivy League first team selection moved to second in both the conference goals and assists rankings, boasting six and four, respectively, on the year.
Since the Crimson returned from its shaky California road trip in mid-September, Freeman has notched at least a point in all four games, averaging two per match. In that same span, Harvard has enhanced its season record to above .500, going 3-0-1, and has remained unbeaten in the Ancient Eight behind Freeman’s seven Ivy League points.
“As one of the guys up top in the system we play, it’s my job to be on the score sheet,” Freeman said. “When it results in goals and assists and setting up other guys as well, it just creates a good feeling around the team.”
In addition to the points, goals, and assists categories, Freeman leads his fellow Crimson teammates in shot attempts, shots on goal, and game-winning goals; overall he accounts for one-third of Harvard goals this season.
Despite all these statistics, he defers modestly to his teammates’ play as the source of his individual success.
“As an attacking group, we’ve developed good composure in the attacking third,” Freeman said. “Can we possess [the ball], can we put the ball in behind, can we make the other team defend? [This mentality has] resulted in good chances and a lot of good looks for other guys as well.”
On Saturday evening, Freeman led an attack that looked sharp for the whole 90 minutes. Especially on the offensive end, his teammates were engaged and involved all night, as the team successfully emphasized the aforementioned keys to the game, namely possessing the ball, sending balls through Cornell’s back line, and forcing the Big Red to defend more often than attack.
“Efficient and effective,” Harvard co-captain Andrew Wheeler-OmiunuI said. “I remember [Freeman] putting away the few shots he had.”
Efficiency has been Freeman’s modus operandi all season, as his shot percentage of .222 is significantly more accurate than the .167 number he has posted in the past two campaigns.
Since joining the team in 2012, Freeman has grown into the team leader he is today, making two All-Ivy teams along the way. And with six guaranteed games left in the season, teammates can only hope that this production continues.
“[Freeman] is one of the leaders on our team,” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “He is embracing [this role] more so this year than I’ve ever seen him before. He’s very good at mentoring and giving advice to the younger strikers.... He also is a very good model of how to conduct [oneself] off the field.”
