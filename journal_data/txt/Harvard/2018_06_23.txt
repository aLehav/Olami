After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador—I sit in a coffee shop in El Salvador, reading a blog post released by the White House two days prior. The headline, titled like a xenophobic Buzzfeed article from hell, reads, “What You Need to Know About the Violent Animals of MS-13.”
The article is, of course, about the Salvadoran gang La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13. “Too many innocent Americans have fallen victim to the unthinkable violence of MS-13’s animals,” the White House release reads.
The article is missing a few details: The United States poured $6 billion into supporting a repressive Salvadoran government that forced its citizens to migrate to the United States, a likely death waiting if they remained. MS-13 was formed in Los Angeles in the United States in large part because of U.S. foreign policy. Deportation policy since then has only increased the size and influence of the gang.
The president of the United States tweets that Democrats “want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,” as if the people from the country that has nursed me, summer after summer, are nothing more than subway rodents or a swarm of locusts sent as celestial punishment.
My dear racist-in-chief, here are the real animals of El Salvador:
Zompopos, or those humongous ants that look as if they’ve been dipped in radioactive waste that’s caused them to grow ten times their intended size. They appear especially menacing if they have wings, like some do.
Aguacateros, or those skinny dogs you find roaming the campo in El Salvador’s more rural departments. Their stomachs will digest nearly anything you throw their way—avocados, stale tortillas, corn cobs, the flesh of a subversive leftist or misidentified campesino in times of civil war.
El torogoz, or the national bird of El Salvador (and also Nicaragua), a bird who flies where it wants with its skinny featherless tail trailing behind it. Coincidentally, a bird that has more right to migrations than the children fleeing violence, perpetual poverty, and abuse in the very country the torogoz represents.
Los cadejos, or those two wolf-like creatures—one white and one black—both meant to lead people back to the best, most moral path in life. One is there to keep you on the right path once you’ve found it, and the other is there to lead you back if you’ve strayed.
It seems that the United States government could use a pair of cadejos working overtime to help it conceive an immigration system that puts people’s lives before rhetoric, puts moral obligation before politics, and acknowledges the basic humanity of Central American refugees.
It’s easy to put Salvadoran children in cages if you convince the world that they are animals. Here’s the reminder that El Salvador does have animals. But they’re birds and dogs and insects, not migrants painfully leaving home because no other choice remains.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the six weeks ending Wednesday, the United States government executed a policy of kidnapping children. At this very moment, thousands of children sit in literal cages with no idea where their parents are or if they will ever see them again.
Despite the dehumanizing rhetoric about immigrant criminals with which Donald Trump has tried to justify this unjustifiable policy, the change that created it entirely dealt with non-criminals: Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s “zero tolerance” policy, combined with a narrowing definition of asylum, meant that even families fleeing gang and domestic violence would be criminally prosecuted, and all, in a major change from the prior policy, would be incarcerated. A stunning 91 percent of parents separated from their children are only charged with misdemeanors—and some have not even been charged. To further discourage some of the world’s most vulnerable people from seeking freedom and prosperity in America, the Trump administration turned to taking children out of their parents’ arms—sometimes literally—and holding them separately from their parents.
The horrifying outcome—children in cages screaming for their parents and infants and toddlers in “tender age shelters”—represents an intentional violation of human rights. As a deterrent for the supposed crime of seeking a safer and better life, the policy violates the Eighth Amendment’s “cruel and unusual punishment” clause (even for non-citizens, as judges have ruled). One noteworthy pediatrician called the family separation policy “government-sanctioned torture of children.” Trump’s immigration policy runs afoul not only of basic decency and our own Constitution but also of international law: Meg Satterthwaite and Rebecca Riddell of Just Security write that the U.S., in its rush to inflict maximum pain on asylum seekers and their children, is violating conventions on refugees, torture, and the rights of the child.
The intense public outcry resulted in Trump signing an executive order that stopped future separations (despite repeating for days that, somehow, only the Democratic minority in Congress could fix the “law” behind it). Democrats have also called on Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen (who presides over Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to resign. Needless to say, these responses are not enough. The order does not guarantee that any of the staggering 2,300 children already separated would ever reunite with their parents. It merely replaces future separations with family detention, which already been the target of intense legal and human rights criticism. Gerald L. Neuman, the J. Sinclair Armstrong Professor of International, Foreign, and Comparative Law at Harvard Law School and the co-director of the Human Rights Program at the Law School, wrote in an email that in his opinion, detaining children, with or without their parents, in order to deter seeking asylum “amounts to arbitrary detention in violation of the United States’s obligations under international human rights law.”
Perhaps even more importantly, the possibility of an embarrassing retreat, or even a lost Cabinet post, clearly failed to dissuade Trump, Sessions, or Nielsen from implementing the policy. It will not stop them, nor future policy-makers, from approving future horrors. Instead, we must investigate this crime against humanity like the crime it is—and actually bring to justice those responsible. Journalist Sean McElwee has one suggestion: The Hague.
McElwee was an early adopter of the “abolish ICE” slogan, and now, ICE abolitionism has reached center-left discourse. Washington Post columnist and former Crimson Editorial Chair Molly L. Roberts ’16 endorsed the idea; Chris L. Hayes (an editor-at-large at The Nation, where McElwee published an article called “It’s Time to Abolish ICE”) discussed it with Senator Kamala Harris; yesterday, New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon called for its abolition. In recent weeks, McElwee has added calls for sending Sessions, Nielsen, and ICE director Thomas Homan to The Hague to his Twitter name, and this idea deserves a similar promotion to discussion in elite circles—Harvard, MSNBC, the Washington Post, and Democratic candidates’ platforms.
Of course, it is basically impossible that Nielsen, Sessions, Trump, or Homan (henceforth the “Big Four”) would stand trial at The Hague’s International Criminal Court. Because the United States is not a party to the Rome Statute, which created the ICC, these crimes lie outside its jurisdiction. (Technically, the United Nations Security Council could refer the case to the ICC, but given the threat of U.S. veto, Neuman says such a referral is “not a factual possibility.”)
But McElwee is less concerned with the mechanics: His point is that, in a remotely sane world, the Big Four would face some kind of justice. “The international community should implement aggressive and punitive sanctions on the United States until it commits to abiding by international law. Donald Trump, Kirstjen Nielsen, Jeff Sessions and Thomas Homan have all been party to brutal human rights violations. If the law is to mean anything, the leaders of the most powerful country in the world should not be above it,” he wrote via a Twitter message.
Indeed, the Big Four could only feel comfortable instituting this policy because of the history of American political leaders avoiding accountability for the consequences of their policies. Imagine how different the discussions among them as they formed the family separation policy might have been if anyone in the Bush administration answered for starting a war that killed more than 250,000 people on false pretenses or if, as the late Anthony Bourdain put it, Henry Kissinger had been treated like someone who “secretly and illegally bombed” a “neutral nation” instead of as a Nobel Peace Prize winner allowed to “nibble nori rolls and remaki at A-list parties.” The norm that let these atrocities go unpunished enabled the Big Four to create child internment camps.
As they would perfectly understand, prosecuting their crimes would create a deterrent, necessary to protect future generations from similar abuses. McElwee points out that immigration will be an increasingly critical human rights issue as climate change increases displacement. “Rising displacement raises the potential for forced movement and other brutal human rights violations,” he wrote. “Were the international community to try Trump, Sessions, Nielsen and Homan it would send a clear and necessary signal about the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.”
If The Hague is out of the question, one law that does apply is 18 U.S.C. 242, which makes it illegal to intentionally violate Constitutional rights. That statute carries a maximum jail sentence of one year. That might seem a short stint, but imagine the impact their mere appearance in court might have on future administrations. Imagine a government in which people believed their decisions had consequences—real consequences, for them. Next time, they might think twice about the suffering their recklessness and intentional cruelty might cause.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard admissions officers received training on the use of race in admissions decisions at least two years in a row, according filings released last week as a part of an ongoing lawsuit alleging the College discriminates against Asian Americans applicants.
The documents—filed in court by the plaintiff in the suit, Students for Fair Admissions, last week—state admissions officers participated in “oral training” that included discussion of the “use of race” in the fall of 2013 and the fall of  2014.
Two admissions officers, whose names were redacted from the public filings, led the meetings, which focused on “casework” and “diversity.”
The filings mark the most recent development in the years-long lawsuit brought by SFFA in 2014. The documents shed light on some previously unknown details of the College’s secretive admissions process.
In a heavily redacted portion of SFFA’s submission, the plaintiff details the substance of the two meetings. The trainings covered three general topics: a review of testing data by race, an analysis of demographic trends with a focus on “Hispanic and Native” populations, and a breakdown of “cultural communities and involvements on campus.”
“Admissions officers also were told that ‘[r]egardless of economic background, Black students’ experiences are impacted by racial bias, both explicit and implicit,’” lawyers for SFFA wrote in the filings. “No such instruction was given with respect to Asian-American applicants.”
Admissions officers also reviewed several statistics meant to contextualize the “demographics” and “experiences” of potential applicants. This included the fact that one year, 49,008 Asian American test takers scored higher than 700 on the math section of the SAT while only 2,101 African Americans did so.
The topics SFFA alleges cropped up in Harvard’s internal meetings are commonly broached in admissions offices across the country, said Ed Boland, a former admissions officer at Yale University. He said these conversations are necessary at schools that—like Harvard—take a holistic approach to admissions.
“If you really are doing a holistic assessment of a student, those are some of the primary areas that are touched upon,” Boland said. “Those factors are helpful background information someone should have as they go into discussions of individual students.”
Lawyers for Harvard wrote in their filings that the College stresses a holistic approach to evaluating applications when it trains new admissions officers.
“Training for admissions officers emphasizes the need to take an individualized approach to evaluating applicants by considering all factors in the application and considering how the applicant will contribute to the overall class,” the document reads.
SFFA lawyers write in their filings that official Harvard “Reading Procedures” do not tell first application readers how or if they should employ race when scoring applications. But the readers are “permitted” to consider an applicant’s race when assigning an overall score, per the SFFA filings.
Both Harvard and SFFA submitted hundreds of pages of documents last week in an effort to persuade the judge to dismiss the suit before it goes to trial. But experts—and the judge herself—have said that outcome is unlikely.
The trial date is set for Oct. 15, 2018.
Correction: June 25, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that, one year, 49,008 Asian American applicants to Harvard scored higher than 700 on the math section of the SAT while only 2,101 African Americans did so. In fact, that statistic refers to Asian American and African American test takers, not to applicants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Life in the kitchen at Night Market moves at a slower clip during the summer months.
On a given night from the months of September to May, chef Jason Tom says the restaurant is usually “rocking out in the kitchen”—with a “go, go, go” pace in the back matching a dining room that can turn over three times some evenings.
Summertime, on the other hand, is "really chill,” according to Tom.
“Since students are away, it’s really slowed down,” he said. “It makes you want to pull your hair out.”
Tom said that during the weekdays in the summer, Night Market will serve around 60 people, whereas during the height of the school year, the restaurant has seen up to 165.
Night Market is not alone among Harvard Square businesses in seeing a summertime slowdown. Despite the annual increase of tourists during the summer months, local shop owners say the departure of College students for the summer is noticeable.
“Summer is for us—as we are not in the heart of Harvard Square—a really big slow season,” Nhon Ma, co-founder of Zinneken's, said. “But we do enough business to stay open, fortunately.”
Ma estimates traffic to the Belgian-themed bakery decreases 20 percent in the summer as compared to the school year. Zinneken’s also sees a decrease in deliveries, according to Ma.
“In the slow times, you’re just like, ‘Oh my god, can we just be busy for a hot second, so I can feel like we’re actually active and moving our bodies?” Tom said about the decrease in foot traffic.
Some business owners around the Square pointed out that tourists who flood the Square during the summer can sometimes offset some of the revenue declines during the summer months that result from having fewer students on campus.
Susan Corcoran, founder of Black Ink, wrote in an email Wednesday that as students leave for the summer, tourists “from all over the world” flock to the Square.
“It's a fun time to work on the sales floor as we hear many languages, interact with people discovering our city, and act as emissaries to the Square,” Corcoran wrote. “The many local festivals and programs hosted by the [Harvard Square Business Association] make for a very active street scene and weekends are particularly energizing.”
Rosamond Lu, chief operating officer of Tom’s Bao Bao, recalled the restaurant's July 2016 opening as another example.
“We opened in the summer thinking that it would be a quiet period for us to really ease into operations,” Lu said.
Quickly though, the location became “very busy,” according to Lu.
She said the establishment continued to attract a steady stream of customers as students returned to campus in the fall.
“When the students arrived, we didn’t do a lot of marketing, so we didn’t see a huge increase when students returned in the fall,” Lu said. Currently, she said Tom’s Bao Bao was looking to expand its social media presence.
On the other hand, less conspicuous businesses like Night Market—tucked away in a basement location on Winthrop St.—rarely see tourists.
“I don’t think tourists are willing to look up or down or around. They see what’s at eye-level, and that’s it. And we’re both literally and figuratively underground,” Tom said.
Mary Canning, founder of Follow the Honey, said that though tourists visit her store in the summer, much of the support her business has received has come from Harvard affiliates.
“We’ve managed to stay afloat outside of underwriting our existence as a small business by having the Harvard community there saying ,‘We want you to be here,’” Canning said. “We’ve done a ton of stuff with Harvard, so Harvard’s a huge ally.”
“Summers are rough,” Canning said. “But I don’t want to isolate it to what summers are like, because having a brick and mortar store is, in this day and era of Amazon, super challenging.”
