After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In January, during a run along the Mount Vernon Trail, the gleam of the marble-domed Jefferson Memorial came into view. Crossing the Potomac River and through the grounds designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, one of us — Dr. Mary K. Daly — ran up the steps to the memorial chamber. Looming in the center is Rudulph Evans’ bronze statue of our former president holding the Declaration of Independence.
On the southwest wall is an excerpt from that document: “All men are created equal […] endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It was a profound moment. Dr. Daly was in Washington as the chief medical officer of mePrism, an online privacy service, for a meeting in the Russell Senate Office Building to discuss privacy in the newborn screening program.  How can any of us enjoy these rights without privacy protection?
In December 2022, just a month before that trip, President Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 into law.  It includes the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act. Daniel was the only son of New Jersey District Judge Esther Salas. He was killed by a litigating attorney who found the judge’s home address online, posed as a delivery man, critically wounded her husband, and fatally shot Daniel.
Judge Salas’ video statement, weeks after Daniel’s death, is heart-wrenching and insightful.  She said, “We may not be able to stop something like this from happening again, but we can make it hard for those who target us to track us down.” Federal judges, she continued, should not be forced to “live in fear for our lives because personal information, like our home addresses, can easily be obtained by anyone seeking to do us or our families harm.”  For her, the stakes of the situation were clear: “This is a matter of life and death and we can’t just sit back and wait for another tragedy to strike.”
The newly-passed Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act recognizes the government’s deep understanding of the serious threats posed by data brokers and people search companies. The Act states, “It shall be unlawful for a data broker to knowingly sell, license, trade for consideration, or purchase covered information of an at-risk individual or immediate family,” improving safety for federal judges across the nation.
It’s hard to imagine that anyone would oppose privacy protection that could have saved Daniel. It is also very hard to reconcile that this Act was voted into law with the knowledge that not just judges, but all citizens, are vulnerable to these risks. What about teachers, nurses, children, victims of domestic violence, service industry staff, police officers, and everyone else?
On the Jefferson monument’s southeast wall is an excerpt from the president’s 1826 letter to Samuel Kercheval: “As new discoveries are made, new truths discovered […] institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.” The Founding Fathers understood the importance of amending the Constitution “to keep pace with the times.” The Fourth, Ninth, and 14th Amendments convey the rights to privacy that should be applied to the "new truths" of this digital age. Now more than ever, in this post-Dobbs world, we must be cognizant of how our privacy will be protected and ensured. The online data marketplace has rapidly outpaced laws, and reaped the financial benefits of this poorly regulated space.
Part of the privilege of attending Harvard, in addition to claiming superiority over Yale and having dining halls that look like Hogwarts, is the gift of using our education to be the voices of the future. Harvard students must ensure our University has the correct foundation on which to build formative experiences that will guide us beyond matriculation.
This necessity extends to Harvard’s own privacy statement, which neither of us, an older graduate of the College nor a current student, had read. After exploring the website, we felt like it buried information, requiring the reader to delve further and further through links to get a full view.
Click the one listed under “Users located outside the United States of America.” You may raise your eyebrows at the more detailed disclosures regarding how Harvard collects and uses data. Open the “Read More” links and you may be surprised at how much additional content appears. If we, as members of the Harvard community, will be among those addressing privacy concerns for the nation, we must understand how personal information is treated by our own institution.
The Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act has dipped its toes into the muddy waters of online data exposure. It protects very few. One of the greatest honors of being an American citizen is the belief that we are all created equal and endowed with the same unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We can start here at Harvard by making sure our privacy policies actually protect us. We can speak up and advocate for a federal privacy law that protects not just a few, but all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I always thought that I sounded pretty neutral, geographically-undefined. It was something I was proud of. Of course, I shouted “y’all” to address a group of people, said “I reckon” every now and then, and even used the oh-so-Southern “the devil is beating his wife” whenever the sun shined in the rain.
But I took pride (sometimes to the point of arrogance) in the fact that I spoke without the accent. No one would be able to tell I was from the South. Well, no one should be able to tell. At least, that’s what I thought.
I had always hated the accent. To me, it was the accent of hillbillies, hicks, and rednecks; people who drove jacked-up pickup trucks and made moonshine in their backyards, everything and everybody I wanted to stay as far away from as possible. For me, the accent symbolized something much more than just a way of speaking. It wasn’t just one of the perhaps thousands of regional linguistic quirks in the English language. The accent symbolized a way of thinking, and that way of thinking was opposite to everything in which I believed.
My lack of the accent wasn’t the only trait that I thought set me apart in my Southern town. I felt like an outsider in every sense of the word. I lean left while Greenville, South Carolina leans the exact opposite. I had mostly left competitive sports behind while athletics defined the lives of many of my Southern peers. I don’t even own a single piece of camouflage clothing (a mortal sin). The accent symbolized everything I wasn’t. And it certainly didn’t help that the only result that shows up when you search “governor with Southern accent” on Google is South Carolina’s very own Henry McMaster.
It seemed I had only one option for a place so equivocally unlike myself: leave.
Imagine my horror, then, when I came to Visitas in April and heard words that still haunt me to this day. “You’re from the South, aren’t you?” I had the accent.
I felt like I had been exposed even though I had no secret to hide. I was going to introduce myself as “Mac from South Carolina” anyways, but the way people said “the South” has stuck with me since then. For the first time in my life, I had been forced to reconcile with the idea that I was indeed from the South. I couldn’t pretend to be a neutral-accented, progressive-minded, geographically-undefined person anymore. I had to be from “the South.”
Over the summer I decided to learn how to speak “neutrally” — though I now use that word with great reservation after my supposedly neutral accent was effortlessly detected. I spent weeks reading about tongue placement and cadence, even watching Youtube videos making fun of the accent so that I could banish every detectable aspect of it from my speech patterns. And for the most part, I was successful. To quote my friends down South, I sounded like a “damn yank.” I still turn heads when I drop an “ain’t” or have a “hankerin’” for something, but I take it as a great compliment whenever someone can’t tell that I’m from below the Mason-Dixon Line.
For 18 years I hated what the accent stood for. I hated that other people viewed it so negatively. To me and the rest of the country, the accent was synonymous with a lack of education, my greatest fear. Even a person like me, born and raised in the South to parents born and raised in the South, had a deep internalized bias towards the accent. I held such great contempt for the negative perception of the accent that I didn’t realize I was partially responsible for this negative perception.
Attempting to drop the accent and engaging in my “Cantabrigian Code-Switching” (as I have come to call it), an action that occurs even in professional academia and research, only emphasizes the perspective that the accent is the mark of ignorance. When Southerners in the world of academia don’t speak with the accent, they are perpetuating the mainstream view because it demonstrates to those without the accent that “smart” Southerners truly don’t have the accent.
Indeed, in a perfect world, the accent would be seen as just that: an accent. But right now, it isn’t. While I know that I am doing nothing but harm to the South’s image (an image which already has plenty of negativity), I still don’t use the accent in Cambridge. “If I heard you with an accent, I would have thought of you completely differently,” joked one of my friends as I was explaining this concept to her, but unfortunately, I agree with her. While I now understand the damage that suppressing my accent does, the internalized bias is still there, and I’m not sure if it ever won’t be.
I truly do love to talk about the South, both the good and the bad. I love reminiscing about the refreshing chill of sweet tea, or the unmatched atmosphere of an SEC football game, or even why the South Carolina Statehouse has cannonball holes in it (think William Tecumseh Sherman).
And whenever I talk about my sometimes-beloved sometimes-hated home, it's always with an accent. But the accent I use here in Cambridge isn’t “the accent.” I use my painstakingly-researched “neutral” accent. That isn’t “my accent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John S. Cooke ’25 and Shikoh Misu Hirabayashi ’24 will serve as the second co-presidents of the Harvard Undergraduate Association, the body’s election commission announced Tuesday.
Cooke and Hirabayashi currently serve as the HUA’s social life officer and academic officer, respectively. Like current HUA Co-Presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24, Cooke and Hirabayashi previously served as representatives on the Undergraduate Council, the HUA’s recently-dissolved predecessor.
The pair’s first priority is to expand mental health resources for students, Hirabayashi said in an interview following the election results.
“John is an FGLI student, I’m an international, and we really understand the challenges people face, especially when they’re at this entirely new environment,” Hirabayashi said. “We want to set up a lot of support networks that could include mentorship programs, summer programs, as well.”
The pair ran on a promise to “Make Harvard Home,” putting forth plans to improve Harvard’s shuttle system, eradicate pests from student dormitories, and decrease Counseling and Mental Health Service wait times to a maximum of 10 days.
Their campaign also promised to bring back weekly funding of clubs, allow for religious and athletic accommodations for exams and classes, and host weekly parties.
“A lot of the things people were supporting from other campaigns, we also agree with,” Cooke said in an interview. “We’re all for just making Harvard home, and we want to have as many people at the table to help us make those decisions.”
Students cast a total of 1,954 ballots in the election, marking a slight increase from the 1,849 cast in the HUA’s inaugural officer election last spring.
The election was conducted via a College-wide ranked-choice vote, which sees votes tallied in several rounds. In the first round, first-choice votes are summed for each ticket. In each subsequent round, the last-place candidate is eliminated and their votes are reallocated to the next-ranked candidates still remaining.
Cooke and Hirabayashi trailed the ticket of Laila A. Nasher ’25 and Ethan C. Kelly ’25 by 102 votes after the first round of voting before pulling ahead in the third round, eventually earning a total of 1,048 votes to Nasher and Kelly’s 889.
“We’re really here to represent everyone on this campus to make this college more accessible, more fun, and more inclusive as well,” Hirabayashi said, adding that the pair would soon send out links for students to set up conversations with them.
Knowing that the results would be released at 5 p.m., Hirabayashi recounted jumping on a Bluebike and pedaling as fast as he could in the rain to get to Cooke’s dorm in DeWolfe after his class in the Harvard Biological Laboratories.
The pair recorded their live reaction to the results.
Cooke said he felt “overcome with happiness” upon hearing the results. “Me and Shikoh, we’re just pretty much a two-person campaign team and to see us win such a hotly contested election, it was just such a happy feeling,” he said.
Voting in the election ran from Feb. 17 to Feb. 19, after two 24-hour delays to the election timeline. The co-presidential tickets debated on Feb. 12.
Peter E. Chon ’26 will serve as the HUA’s academic officer in the only contested non-presidential officer election. While Josh A. Kaplan ’26 and Corbin C. Lubianski ’24 both ran for treasurer, an amendment passed during the election added a second treasurer position, granting both candidates the role.
The full officer election results can be found below:
In addition to the co-president and officer elections, students voted on amendments to the HUA constitution, which require the approval of two-thirds of voters to pass.
Roughly 75 percent of students voted to re-organize the Well-Being Team into two separate teams — the Well-Being Team and the Inclusion Team.
The Well-Being Team is responsible for “helping students navigate resources on Harvard’s campus regarding emotional, mental, and physical health.” The Inclusion Team focuses on identity-related resources, working with the Office for Gender Equity; the Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging; the Harvard Foundation; and the Accessible Education Office.
One of the other amendments proposed the HUA co-president title be renamed to “co-coordinator.” Only 53 percent of students voted in favor of this change, and it did not pass.
The full results for voting on the amendments proposals can be found below:

When Aaron J. Rosales ’26 was applying to college after serving in the military for over eight years, he didn’t think Harvard was even an option.
After spending a year in community college, he logged into a virtual college fair for a friend who couldn’t attend.
In the Zoom breakout room, Rosales met College admissions officer Roger Banks, who encouraged Rosales to apply to Harvard even though Rosales didn’t think he was eligible.
“He was so nice — one of the nicest people I’ve met when it comes to recruitment and admissions,” Rosales said. “He’s like, ‘Why don’t you send me your stuff, and I’ll take a look at it, or one of my colleagues, and I will get back to you, tell you whether you’d be wasting your time?’”
Two weeks later, Rosales received the green light to apply to the College.
Today, Rosales is one of fourteen veterans in the class of 2026. In the 2021-2022 school year, 59 former service members attended the College — less than 1 percent of enrolled students that year. Despite the low numbers, in recent years, the College has increased its efforts to recruit applicants currently serving in the military, more than doubling the number of veteran admits since 2019.
As part of its push to admit more veterans, in 2017 the College joined Service to School’s VetLink program, an initiative that guides veterans through the process of applying to the nation’s most selective universities.
Several veterans at the College said that they utilized these nonprofit organizations, including Service to School and the Warrior Scholar Project, during the application process.
Service to School provides free college counseling to U.S. military veterans by pairing prospective applicants with mentors, including veterans pursuing higher education and recent graduates. These mentors guide the applicants step-by-step through the application process.
Like Service to School, the Warrior Scholar Project offers college bootcamps on campuses across the country — week-long academic intensives in humanities, STEM, and business that aim to simulate the rigor of the undergraduate experience. Harvard is one of those campuses.
“It’s supposed to be like what a week at this school would feel like — except it’s actually a lot more work,” Conor R. Meyer ’26 said. “It goes from 8 a.m. in the morning to 8 p.m. at night. It’s supposed to up your confidence that you can make it as a student at a prestigious school when you’re still a veteran.”
While the Common Application asks applicants to describe their unique life stories in under 650 words, Service to School allows veterans to elaborate on their military experience and contextualize it for the admissions committee through a VetLink addendum.
“It serves as a translation for all those scary military words and puts it in a perspective that many people can understand,” Quinn H.J. Ewanchyna ’25 said.
“I would say that I would not be here at Harvard if it weren’t for Service To School,” Ewanchyna added. “I was so inspired by what they did for me, I’m now a Service to School ambassador, working with other transfer applicants.”
Service to School then sends the addendum — which includes a veteran’s awards, experience, military education, and additional essay — to the admissions committee.
Matthew S. Malkin ’26 said he was paired with a mentor who was familiar with higher education — a facet that Malkin said helped guide him through the application process.
“Everybody in my family went to the same college — University of Arizona. They expected me to do the same. And I decided to try something out,” Malkin said. “So he helped me understand higher-level education in a different light, in the sense that you need to really set yourself apart from both your peers and all other applicants.”
For Malkin, drafting the addendum was, at times, frustrating.
“That process was very difficult for me, solely because of my mentor, because every time I sent it — ‘Hey, do you have any suggestions?’ — it always came back red,” Malkin said.
In the end, however, Malkin said he felt he put his strongest foot forward during the application process.
“It’s not that I felt really confident. It’s just like, I felt like I presented myself in the best light,” he said.
On March 31, 2022, Rosales logged into his Harvard admissions portal to find confetti and “Congratulations!” flashing across his screen.
“Then the real thrill though, once the balloons and the happiness, the emotions finally settled down, was ‘Where do you want to land? Which school’s going to be the best for you?’” Rosales said.
When deciding where he should matriculate, Rosales reached out to a number of current undergraduate veterans to learn more about campus culture. In April 2022, he attended Visitas, a weekend when the College hosts admitted students on campus.
Meyer recalled his own Visitas, where he said he coincidentally came face-to-face with the admissions officer who read his application.
“This guy came up to me and was like, ‘Hey, are you Conor?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, who are you?’” Meyer said. “And he’s like, ‘Hey, I’m Angel, I’m your admissions officer. I was your first read.’”
“So he’s like, ‘Yeah, I’ve been endorsing you forever. So you’re kind of like a celebrity to me,’” Meyer added.
Still, after receiving their acceptances, veterans face the hurdle of adjusting to social life on campus.
Malkin, whose last operations were in the intelligence community, described the transition as “going from a world that has a lot of violence associated with it” to a “very inspirational and hopeful academic setting.”
“I’m very happy to be here, but it’s definitely a challenge,” he said.
Ewanchyna, who applied to the College as a transfer student, said he and other veterans on campus have formed a “very tight-knit” and “very supportive” group.
“We will go out of our way to ensure success with each other,” Ewanchyna said. “Harvard’s a very competitive environment and community; however, I don’t feel that that competitiveness necessarily resides within the veteran community.”
“Military veterans are often regarded as the heroes in society,” he added. “But to me, the heroes in the world walk beside me at Harvard, and they’re other Harvard students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School professor Meghan L. O’Sullivan will serve as the next director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, the Kennedy School announced Tuesday.
O’Sullivan will take over the role from former Pentagon Chief of Staff Eric B. Rosenbach starting July 1. Rosenbach co-directed the center with former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter until Carter’s unexpected death in October 2022.
“I am honored to lead the Center and follow in the footsteps of intellectual giants like Ash Carter and Graham Allison and to work with Belfer’s phenomenal faculty, staff, and students on the world’s toughest problems,” O’Sullivan said in a Tuesday press release announcing her appointment.
O’Sullivan served as special assistant to former President George W. Bush from 2004 to 2007 and deputy national security advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan in the final two years of her term. Previously, she served as the senior director for Iraq in the U.S. National Security Council.
“I believe that my experience working for and advising people in both Democratic and Republican positions will help the Center continue its tradition on non-partisan, evidence based, policy-relevant research, regardless of who is in control in Washington,” she wrote in an email to HKS affiliates shortly after her appointment was announced.
Founding Dean of the Kennedy School and former Director of the Belfer Center Graham T. Allison ’62 expressed his support for O’Sullivan’s appointment in a press release Tuesday. When O’Sullivan joined the Kennedy School in 2008, Allison co-taught one of her first courses, “Central Challenges of American Foreign Policy.”
“While of course no single individual could possibly replace Ash Carter, Meghan O’Sullivan will be a great successor,” Allison said in the press release. “I look forward to supporting her as she leads the Belfer Center up the mountain to the next horizon.”
In October of last year, O’Sullivan’s class was interrupted by anti-war activists who were critical of her association with Raytheon Technologies, a defense contractor, and for her role in Bush’s Iraq and Afghanistan policies. The protest was co-organized by an activist group called Resist and Abolish the Military Industrial Complex that had staged other protests against Raytheon.
RAM INC condemned the Kennedy School’s appointment of O’Sullivan “in the face of student and community outrage” in a statement to The Crimson, referencing the incoming director’s role in the Iraq War and the Belfer Center’s influence on defense policy.
Harvard Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith declined to comment.
O’Sullivan will step down from her position on the Raytheon Board of Directors, on which she has served since 2017, before assuming her role at the Belfer Center.
O’Sullivan wrote in her email to HKS affiliates that she will focus on outreach during the beginning of her appointment.
“I will spend the early part of my tenure talking to a wide range of stakeholders — including current policymakers — to help me identify where the Center can and should focus going forward,” she wrote.
O’Sullivan added that she plans on further developing the Technology and Public Purpose program, which was established by former co-directors Carter and Rosenbach, as well as preserving the Center’s work on nuclear threats.
“Building on those programs will not only be a way to strengthen Ash’s legacy, but also to help fill a critical gap between technologists and policymakers that is evident,” she wrote.
Instead of co-directing the Center with O’Sullivan, Rosenbach, a lecturer in public policy, will be stepping down to focus on research, teaching, and writing.
“She is the perfect person to lead the Belfer Center. She is an outstanding academic, thought-leader, and policymaker,” Rosenbach wrote in an email. “Beyond all her impressive professional accomplishments, she’s also a great human. And it’s pretty awesome — and historic — that we’ll have an all female leadership team at the center.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ford Foundation President Darren Walker discussed social inequality and declining economic mobility in the United States, as well as the role mentorship played in his own success, at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Tuesday evening.
The discussion was moderated by Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr. — a Harvard professor and director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research — and included opening remarks from HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf. During the event, Walker discussed how rising economic inequality, caused by historic injustices, poses a threat to democracy in the United States.
“One of the real conundrums for those of us who profess to be capitalists, and I am among them, is that capitalism is not working anymore for many people,” Walker said. “Part of it is because of the way in which inequality takes hold in a society through policy, through a sort of social construction that continues to marginalize people who historically have been marginalized and also marginalize people who haven’t been historically marginalized.”
Walker, who spearheaded efforts at the Ford Foundation to focus philanthropic efforts on remedying social inequality, said addressing the issue should be a key priority for philanthropists.
“I believe inequality is among the greatest threats to our democracy,” Walker said. “Inequality asphyxiates hope, and hope is the oxygen of democracy.”
Walker said the decline of the American dream, which he referred to as the “mobility escalator,” is fueling political divisions.
“The escalator has stopped moving for far too many people, and it has stopped moving for people for whom it always moved,” Walker said. “Today, the escalator has stopped for a lot of white Americans, and that’s what is different about today, and that’s what is infecting our politics, too.”
“Black folks have never felt entitled to get on the escalator,” Walker added. “We have a history where Black business owners who got on the escalator — and started riding it and became prosperous — found that their communities were burned down.”
Gates added that in addition to the new frustrations in politics, the rise of discrimination against minority groups in the United States are connected to this “diminishment of hope.”
“Hopelessness leads to desperation. Hopelessness leads to the need to scapegoat,” he said. “It’s no accident the rise of antisemitism, the rise of anti-Black racism, homophobia, etc. etc., anti-trans sentiment, are related exactly to the diminishment of hope.”
During the event, Walker and Gates also discussed the important role mentors played in their professional lives. Gates said that when students ask him for “the secret to your success,” he refers to such mentors.
Walker, an openly gay Black man, similarly attributed his successes in his professional life to his “amazing mentors,” who he said “had a lot to do” with his becoming President of the Ford Foundation nearly a decade ago.
“I think one of the ways to gain mentors is to work really hard. There is no shortcut to that,” Walker said. “And there is definitely no shortcut for a Black person in America to that.”

Author Jennifer F. Boylan discussed her experience with gender transition and the themes of revision and reinvention at a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study lecture last Thursday.
The lecture, titled “The Heisenberg Variations: Imagination, Invention, and Uncertainty,” centered around the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, or the inability to experience your work the way your audience does, and how it applied to her journey of self-discovery and authorship. After her speech, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Russo joined the conversation.
Boylan began her lecture by describing the difficulty of transitioning to living openly as a woman.
“I thought about my parents. I thought about the clear and escapable fact that I was female in spirit and how in order to be whole, I’d have to give up on every dream I’ve ever had,” Boylan said.
According to Boylan, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle suggests that the “act of observing something changes the thing being observed.”
“It’s a handy way of describing the difficulties of knowing anything for certain,” she explained.
Boylan connected the principle to her relationship with her appearance.
“I remember being a teenager high on multiple bong hits and staring into the mirror for so long that I no longer recognized the thing reflected as me, which sounds just like another amazing drug tale except for the fact that in this, I was not wrong,” Boylan said.
“The person that I saw there was not me, not by a longshot. I would spend many of the years that followed resorting to one desperate measure after another in the hope — always monstrously improbable — that one day, against all odds, the reflection in the mirror would show my face,” she added.
Boylan said her English professor at Johns Hopkins University, John S. Barth, helped shape her passion for writing, which helped her understand her identity.
“Sometimes I’ve been asked how I’ve made that transition; I can only say that above all else, the most important way I found of making sense of my life was by seeing it as a story, by finding the thread of narrative that brought sense and reason to what otherwise felt like chaos,” she said.
Boylan later discussed Canadian classical pianist Glenn Gould and Johann Sebastian Bach’s musical composition, Goldberg Variations, referencing the Heisenberg principle once more.
“In 1981, at the age of 49, Gould returned to the Goldberg Variations. He said of at least one of the variations that he had recorded in his youth, he could no longer recognize the person who had played it,” Boylan said.
At the end of her lecture, Boylan described the inspiration behind the piece.
“Hermann Karl von Keyserling — for whom J. S. Bach wrote the Goldberg Variations — was once described as a cheerful man of sin who kept a harem of ladies with 354 bastards. It’s also said that he had trouble sleeping at night,” she said.
“You can imagine the Count tossing and turning at night, wondering which bastard was going to show up next,” Boylan joked.

Harvard affiliates, students, and scholars gathered this weekend for the sixth annual Black Health Matters conference around the theme of “Decolonizing Black Health.”
The two-day event, hosted by the Harvard Undergraduate Black Health Advocates, featured conversations with scholars — including the first Black deaf academic hosted by a student organization at Harvard, according to organizers — as well as keynote speeches, panels, and opportunities to purchase goods from local Black-owned businesses.
The conference was hosted in Northwest Labs and held in person for the first time in two years after the group’s conferences were shifted online due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Kristen A. Harriott ’24, co-president of HUBHA, said this year’s theme aimed to “challenge and transform” approaches to health care that may have been shaped by “colonialism, racism, and other forms of oppression.”
“At its core, decolonizing health involves shifting focus from Western medicine and holistic approaches to health to a maybe more holistic and community-centered approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness of all aspects of health — which may include social, cultural, environmental, maybe even spiritual factors,” she said.
HUBHA Co-President Kareem I. King ’23 described the difficulties that came with transitioning from a virtual to an in-person conference, which included obtaining funding and maintaining engagement throughout the day.
This year’s conference also featured a conversation with Franklin Jones Jr., a Ph.D. candidate at Liberty University and lecturer at Boston University, who discussed his experiences navigating the healthcare system as a Black deaf person and the history of Black American Sign Language.
Imani Fonfield ’25, a hard-of-hearing student who serves as co-director of advocacy and community engagement for HUBHA, characterized the process of organizing the panel as “foreign” and “overwhelming.”
Ultimately, however, Fonfield wrote that finding a Black-identifying ASL interpreter for the event was gratifying, describing the interpreters as her “golden contacts.”
Fonfield reflected in a statement that she “learned an incredible amount” about navigating interpreter services and encountered interpreters who were willing to “lift our mission up” despite accessibility challenges.
During the conference, a Sunday panel titled “Understanding and Resolving Black Americans’ Mistrust in Our Health Care System” explored discrepancies and discrimination in healthcare for Black Americans.
The speakers — Co-Project Director Eileen Milien, Director of Youth Programs Laetitia Pierre-Louis, and Director of Education and Curriculum Efosa Enoma — are on the Board of Directors at We Got Us, a Boston-based collective that aims to educate and empower marginalized groups about Covid-19, the vaccine, and medical racism.
During the panel, Enoma said that there are deeper reasons for vaccine hesitancy in Black communities.
“A lot of times you just want to say, ‘Oh, Black people don’t trust the medical community. That’s their fault, hands off,’” Enoma said.
But Enoma discussed a history of racism in the medical field as a larger reason for distrust, citing experiments by J. Marion Sims on enslaved women that formed the basis for oncology.
“The founder of gynecology isn’t a white man, it’s Black women. We founded gynecology with our bodies, unfortunately, without our consent,” she said. “But we see how today, we still face the biggest health disease when it comes to our gynecological health, we still have the highest rates of fibroids and other backlog issues.”
Oge C. Ogbogu ’24, the internal outreach director of the conference, said that there has been a “really great” and “positive” response from speakers and attendees, especially given the interactive nature of the panels.
“One of the amazing things about this conference was that every panel that you went to, every keynote, every person, was so actively engaged, asking questions, and just like, wanting to learn,” she said.
She described the conference as more of an “open process of discussion,” rather than a “top-down of speaker to audience.”
King said the reason for putting on the annual conferences is to bring to light issues facing Black communities.
“We think about how our people are differentially treated in the healthcare system and ways that we can work to essentially transform that for the future and keep raising awareness about it so that it does change at the higher levels,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following recent decisions by two Harvard schools to pull out of the U.S. News and World Report’s annual rankings, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana emphasized the importance of providing adequate information about the College to prospective applicants.
“I think that that’s a combination of both, kind of quantitative and qualitative data, and it’s not something that can be reduced to a single number,” Khurana said.
Harvard Law School last November and Harvard Medical School in January announced that they would stop participating in the U.S. News rankings, citing perverse incentives and fairness and equity concerns.
Universities like Harvard — ranked No. 3 — currently participate in the rankings by sharing key admissions and demographics data with the U.S. News magazine, information Khurana said is valuable to provide to applicants.
“One of the things that’s the most important to me is that students and prospective students make the best decision for what college is right for them,” Khurana said.
Khurana added there are thousands of institutions of higher education in the United States and many are “really high-quality.”
“I hope people will focus on a decision about what’s right for them, more than something overly reductive like either a ranking or even a brand name,” Khurana added.
Khurana also discussed the following topics:
Khurana laid out priorities for improving student mental health while underscoring the resources available to those experiencing acute mental health challenges, pointing to improvements to the College’s advising system.
“To me, it’s thinking about ‘What are my responsibilities as a college to create an environment that is generative, affirmative, and supportive?’” Khurana said.
Khurana said while he believes the College’s residential system is an asset, he added that “there’s more that we want to do to promote and strengthen healthy practices that lead to well-being.”
Khurana also addressed criticism of Harvard’s mental health care services, specifically long wait times for appointments at Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Service.
“One of the most important things we can do is to let students know who are in crisis that there is immediate help available,” Khurana said.
In recent months, Quincy House residents have reported an uptick in pests and rodents in their suites, a challenge Khurana said is linked to maintaining Harvard’s “classical” and “old” architecture.
“The presence of rodents is upsetting, and, you know, it’s not a feature of the system, it’s a bug. No pun intended,” he said.
To combat unwelcome insects and rodents, Khurana encouraged students to contact their house building managers following sightings and to refrain from leaving out food waste.
“Keeping our rooms clean, especially making sure that we’re not leaving unfinished food around or in trays outside our doors — these are all areas that, you know, we have direct control over,” Khurana said. “It’s not only the right thing to do to prevent infestation, but it’s also respectful to our custodial staff and our dining staff.”
Amid turnover of some of the University’s top posts — including the presidency and dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — Khurana strongly signaled that he plans to remain dean of the College for the foreseeable future.
“I love being the dean of the College. I pinch myself every single day that I get to do this job and be around you,” said Khurana, who was appointed College dean in 2014. “I’m very happy in the job that I’m doing and continue to do the best that I can.”
In December, the University announced FAS Dean Claudine Gay would succeed outgoing president Lawrence S. Bacow, leaving a vacancy in her wake. The following month, the College announced that Princeton administrator Thomas Dunne would succeed Katherine G. O’Dair as Dean of Students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard President-elect Claudine Gay prepares to take office, sitting University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he will have no power over the searches for successors to four outgoing Harvard deans.
In an interview Tuesday, Bacow suggested that Gay is already wielding authority over the University’s most important hiring decisions. While Gay does not officially take office until July 1, she will be empowered to select the four new deans, including her own successor as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“They’re going to be her deans, and she needs to make those choices,” Bacow said. “It worked exactly the same way when I became president.”
Bacow’s decision to relinquish control offers insight into the delicate transition period in which one University president seals a legacy while his successor prepares to chart a new — and potentially divergent — course.
The four dean selections will likely provide a window into Gay’s initial priorities and test her abilities to make personnel decisions at the University’s highest levels.
In addition to the four dean departures, Harvard University Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister announced last November that he will retire at the end of the current academic year. The University has not yet announced Hollister’s successor.
The searches for the next dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and for Gay’s successor as FAS dean launched earlier this month. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 is helping Gay lead the FAS dean search.
Bacow said that filling key positions in the University is one of the president’s most important jobs, but added that selecting a great dean is “not rocket science.”
Any FAS dean must be “deeply respected by the faculty” and have the “capacity to recruit the right people, to make judgments about who is worthy of promotion,” Bacow said.
Bacow repeatedly declined to answer specific questions about the timeline of the FAS dean search and the academic background of candidates — including whether the school should favor a scholar from the sciences and whether it should privilege someone from within its own ranks.
Bacow repeatedly directed queries about the FAS dean selection process to Gay, who has refused to meet for regularly scheduled interviews with The Crimson this semester — the first time in a decade that a sitting FAS dean has declined to regularly meet with reporters.
As Gay transitions into Massachusetts Hall, she and Bacow speak regularly and have a weekly standing meeting, according to Bacow.
But Bacow insisted that Gay has not assumed any official presidential duties.
“The University can only have one president at a time,” he said. “She’s got enough to do right now without trying to be the president in some dimensions.”
In Gay’s last months as FAS dean, she will continue leading a cluster hire of faculty in climate studies and working with Brenda D. Tindal, the newly-appointed FAS campus curator, on updating the school’s visual presence. Gay will also hand off a large part of a three-year FAS strategic planning process set to recommend reforms for the school’s long-term success.
In addition, Bacow said Gay is doing what “every new president does,” meeting with and building a network of administrators and faculty across the University.
Among Gay’s most important presidential duties will be launching a University-wide capital campaign. Harvard’s most recent campaign, which concluded in 2018, was helmed by former University President Drew G. Faust and closed out at $9.6 billion.
Though Bacow did not lead a capital campaign during his time in office, he said Gay will “pretty definitely” not begin the fundraising initiative during her first year as president. Still, Bacow said he is confident in her ability to fundraise for the University, pointing to Gay’s experience as dean of the FAS.
“I think Claudine did very, very, very well as a fundraiser,” he said. “You cannot be successful as a dean — probably any dean of a school, but especially one the size and complexity of FAS — without having the capacity to help raise resources to support the enterprise.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 18 seasons with the Harvard women’s golf team and ten seasons with the Harvard men’s golf, former professional golf player and head coach Kevin Rhoads will split his time in half as former assistant head coach Naree Song transitions into taking over the women’s golf team as head coach.
Though Song has been an associate coach for Harvard since 2015, the Bangkok, Thailand native began golfing at the young age of seven years old and started competing at the international level just shortly after that.
“I played my first tournament in the U.S. representing Thailand when I was nine,” Song said.
Song then immigrated to the United States at the age of eleven to play at IMG Academy, a boarding school in Bradenton, Fla. geared towards preparing students to play collegiate athletics. By the age of 17, she went professional, even playing at the U.S. Women’s Open in 2000, but due to injuries she changed course and took a step towards education and coaching.
“I thought that the next most fulfilling thing would be to use my knowledge and skills to enhance somebody else’s life and somebody else’s golf game,” the head coach reflected.
Song received her first taste of coaching at Rollins College in Florida.
“I wasn’t sure how much I would like coaching, but I wanted to give it a try,” Song reflected. “It was my first experience in college coaching and I really enjoyed it.”
According to Song, Julie Garner, the current head coach of women’s golf at Rollins, made a major impact on her career in coaching and remains an incredible mentor to her. Interestingly enough, Harvard women’s golf commenced its 2023 spring season against Song’s former team and mentor on February 18.
“I actually played Kevin and the Harvard ladies when I was at Rollins, so I’m on the opposite side,” head coach Song stated. “I had a wonderful mentor, who is still the head coach – so it is kind of like full circle.”
For Song, coaching has been a thrilling and worthwhile experience because she finds it just as fulfilling as playing, giving her the opportunity to “use her expertise and knowledge to help somebody else out.”
Since she joined the Crimson in 2015 as an associate head coach, Harvard has won two Ivy League Championships, in 2016 and 2019, eleven tournament victories, and have had two NCAA Regional appearances, in 2016 and 2019.
“I don’t want to give myself too much credit because the ladies here have been successful for a long time under coach Kevin and Fred,” Song stated.
In addition to crediting longtime Harvard coaches Rhoads and Fred Schernecker ‘89, she credits her ability to adapt as an important piece that has allowed her to mesh so well with the team. that “probably one of my strengths is being able to adapt to what the culture is and go with the flow a little bit.”
As the Covid-19 pandemic has made a deep impact on collegiate athletics worldwide – the Ivy League was the first Division I league to cancel Spring seasons back in 2020 – head coach Song has had to continually adapt as a coach and make changes to ensure her team was taken care of, but also roll with the punches and be prepared for quick changes in the pace of Division I athletics
“Being in front of the team as much as possible and [make] sure I understand their needs and how everyone is feeling, and not being afraid to adjust if we need to.”
With the pandemic in the past for the most part, the new head coach looks forward to the future and hopes to see her team where no other Ivy League golf team has gone: the NCAA Championship. Currently, Song compares her team’s goal of reaching the NCAA Championship to putting a person on the moon, that “with each team that we have, can we continue to get one step closer not knowing for sure when we are going to get there, so I try to use this as an inspiration for them.”
Song and Harvard women’s golf continue to set their sights on bigger goals, making clear that continuing to push their game forward every day is more important to focus on than just winning.
“I think that if you take care of the daily practices and goals, it will lead to more winnings long term.”
Harvard women’s golf spring season will continue during spring break on March 15 in Arizona, when the Crimson will face Northern Arizona University. The team will then take two more road trips out west and down south for the Intercollegiate at Prospect Bay invitational and Harvard Invitational in early April before rounding out the regular season at the Ivy League Championships in New York on April 21, 22, and 23.

Disclaimer: We love Tatte. But hey, the clickbait worked — you clicked.
As much as we were tempted to gatekeep this treasured find, it didn’t work Faro Café’s bustling wood-white interior was just too cozy and welcoming to keep it a secret. Tucked behind Zinneken’s on Arrow Street, Faro Café is our new obsession — with warm lighting, a record player (???), and so. many. plants, it’s the perfect place for when you want to pretend that you have your life together and you did NOT spend 58 minutes in the CS office hours queue.
If you’re trying to hold down the fort for a study session at Faro, we recommend arriving early, not long after they open at 8 a.m. True, you won’t get the pleasure of duking it out with a semi-retired couple over a one-foot-diameter glorified stool like at Tatte, but the small space does fill up quickly. True to character, Faro was packed with solo studiers at 9:30 a.m. as we wandered in, but we managed to snag a table by the window for maximum people-watching as we sipped on our coffee. Investigative journalism!
EKR: I ordered a flat white, and to be honest, it’s the only thing I’ve ordered upon my many returns (yes, it was that good). Complete with a carefully curated latte design on top and handed to me in a warm mug, it was the perfect start to the day. I stole a sip of a friend’s iced vanilla latte, and it was evident that the vanilla syrup was house made - the sign of a high-quality cafe.
ESD: Deep in my corporate girl phase, I ordered an Americano — with a splash of macadamia milk because don’t worry, I still have a personality. As a self-proclaimed coffee non-expert, I thought the espresso was perfectly balanced, rich and smooth and the right amount of bitterness for that morning pick-me-up.
We only were able to try a couple drinks, but their House Latte, Maple Latte, Dirty Chai, and Gruyere Scones are at the top of our list for our next visit. And yes, we will be coming back.
Faro is what Cambridge needed. It’s far enough from the yard that the tourists won’t find it (sorry, Tatte and Peet’s) and it is practically a warm hug in cafe form. When you want to romanticize your life, sip on a fabulous latte and forget that you’re drowning in assignments and applications — Faro is the go-to.
