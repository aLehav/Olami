After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Planned Parenthood doctor was secretly taped casually discussing the harvesting, and possibly selling, of aborted baby’s organs. Chatting over a salad and wine, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, the organization’s senior director of medical services, graphically describes how doctors can “crush” the right parts of the body during the abortion procedure in order to preserve some of the organs, and considers offering a “menu” of baby body parts to interested parties. She also describes a partial-birth abortion and says, “The federal abortion ban is a law…and laws are up to interpretation.”
The nonchalant discussion of these details is enough to make anyone’s stomach churn, but reactions from the liberal media are a garbled mess of mockery at conservatives’ alarm. A writer from Cosmopolitan said, “I’m just going to yawn.” Democrats like Rep. Barbara Lee dismissed the video, saying the Center for Medical Progress (the pro-life group that created the video) has been “attacking Planned Parenthood for years.”
The video in question, full of choppy editing and dramatic background music, slides, and anti-abortion rhetoric, undoubtedly is an attack on Planned Parenthood. Does that mean we should dismiss it entirely? Of course not. The sound bites that have surfaced are alarming and warrant a second look into Planned Parenthood’s behavior. We have an obligation to look into the claims and treat the situation as a criminal investigation, not just another blip on the abortion debate timeline.
It’s illegal to sell body parts for money. It’s also illegal to administer partial-birth abortions, according to law that passed in 2003 and held up by the Supreme Court in 2007. At the very least, we should be concerned about the possibility of medical malpractice. CNN points out, “doctors shouldn't change how they treat the patient in order to harvest good tissue for donation”, which it sure sounds like Nucatola is suggesting on the tape.
Because Planned Parenthood is federally funded, every citizen in America is involved in this issue. In 2013, $540.6 million dollars of taxpayer’s money went to the organization. While that money is specifically prohibited fromtowards funding abortions, it still supports the organization as a whole, making up almost half of their total funding. So John Boehner isn’t overreacting when he called for an investigation into Planned Parenthood in Congress. We need to know the details of the group we are supporting.
However, other members of the GOP have gone too far. Some Republican presidential candidates—Rand Paul, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and others—have called for defunding the entire organization, which shouldn’t happen based on the Center for Medical Progress’s video alone, because it presents no clear evidence of legal wrongdoing.
The same logic that demands we look into Planned Parenthood’s activity because of the released video also argues that we shouldn’t simply defund the organization without any real evidence they have committed crimes. Planned Parenthood does a great deal of public good, providing birth control, STD testing, and other health services, many of which aren’t even abortion related. To defund all of that without an investigation is unfair and a jump to conclusions fueled by ideology, not by sense.
If Planned Parenthood isn’t making any profits off their tissue donations or conducting illegal abortions, then they don’t have anything to hide. Citizens’ taxpayer money goes into this organization, so we have a right to inquire on their practices. And quite frankly, even if our money didn’t go into the organization, respect for upholding our own laws demands we look into this situation.
Politics will package this as the right trying to defund abortion clinics and the left as having no sensitivity towards unborn life. But you don’t have to be against legal abortions to be disturbed by the possibility of Planned Parenthood’s illegal behavior. Continuing to see this issue as pro-life against pro-choice downplays the potential criminal activity involved. If we make this a political topic, if we allow Planned Parenthood’s advocates to dismiss the attacks on them as right-wing nonsense, then we aren’t taking our responsibility to uphold our own country’s laws seriously.
I hope Planned Parenthood isn’t involved in the terrible acts it is being accused of. But until we know, how can we confidently endorse or denounce Planned Parenthood? How can we feel ethically about continuing to fund Planned Parenthood with taxpayer money?
“These groups have been widely discredited and their claims fall apart on closer examination, just as they do in this case,” Planned Parenthood said in their defense. For our nation’s sake, let’s hope the Planned Parenthood is conducting itself “under the highest ethical and legal standards” like they say they are, but let’s not just take their word for it. If the video’s claims do turn out to be true, defunding is still an inappropriate reaction. If Planned Parenthood is committing crimes, they deserve more than a lack of federal money—they deserve to be jailed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 22, 2015, at 1:28 a.m.
James F. Rothenberg ’68 finished his last class at Harvard in 1970, but for the next 45 years he was never far away. As an active alumnus, and then Harvard’s treasurer and a member of the Harvard Corporation, he remained intimately connected to the university he loved, advising its leaders and helping manage its money, until his death Tuesday. He was 69.
Rothenberg’s death, reportedly of a heart attack, was unexpected. As recently as Sunday he had spoken with Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 about University business. On Tuesday afternoon, Rothenberg’s many friends across the University were reeling at the news.
“He had an enormous institutional history.… He had a completely unique combination of experience, historical perspective, intellect, and judgment,” Lee said. “You can never replace him.”
Rothenberg worked particularly closely with a small crop of Harvard’s top leaders, including Lee, the CEOs of Harvard Management Company during his time as treasurer, and University President Drew G. Faust.
“Jim was one of the best friends Harvard has ever had, and his selfless leadership, gentle wisdom, humane spirit, and boundless generosity in service of Harvard will live on always,” Faust said in a statement Tuesday. “We will miss Jim more than I can say.”
Lawrence H. Summers, who in the latter part of his Harvard presidency worked closely with Rothenberg, remembered his “surpassing decency, honor, and goodness,” in a statement on Tuesday.
In 2004, Rothenberg was named Harvard’s treasurer, a position he held until 2014. He helped lead Harvard through the turbulence of the 2008 recession and waves of tough decisions about the financial future of the University.
“He played a big role in helping to stabilize Harvard’s finances in a period of huge challenges,” said Susan L. Graham ’64, a member of the Harvard Corporation. “His guidance was essential, and he did it in a very constructive way, very collaborative way.”
Also in 2004, Rothenberg took one of seven seats on the Corporation, Harvard’s highest governing body.
His colleagues on that board, including Paul J. Finnegan ’75, looked to him for guidance.
“Jim was devoted to Harvard and selfless in his time energy,” said Finnegan, who called Rothenberg a mentor and who replaced him as treasurer last year. “We will all remember him as an individual, and also we’ll remember his many contributions to the Corporation and to the University as a whole.”
At his regular meetings on campus, colleagues could count on Rothenberg for well-placed humor and a distinct chuckle. Jessica T. Mathews ’67, Rothenberg’s colleague on the Corporation, said he was someone she liked to sit next to—he would say things under his breath.
Graham called Rothenberg “one of the sparks, one of the people that made it fun to work hard.”
Rothenberg wore many hats at Harvard. He chaired Harvard Management Company’s board of directors from 2004 until his death, and he co-chaired the ongoing University-wide $6.5 billion capital campaign. He was also a member of the Committee on University Resources, an elite group of Harvard donors.
In those roles, Rothenberg was often tasked with communicating University positions and developments. He patiently and politely listened to questions from a generation of reporters, but he was always a determined representative of Harvard, as one 2006 quotation makes clear.
“When the Corporation wants to communicate with The Crimson about that topic, it will,” he told a Crimson reporter who had asked about the future of then-University President Lawrence H. Summers.
After Summers resigned, Rothenberg was a member of the search committee that eventually chose Faust. Lee, who joined Rothenberg in that select group, fondly remembered evading enterprising reporters with his friend before the final interview with then-Radcliffe Institute Dean Faust by stopping in at Daedelus on Mt. Auburn Street.
“There are so many things that we went through together,” Lee said of his relationship with Rothenberg.
After graduating from the College with a degree in English, Rothenberg attended Harvard Business School and graduated in 1970. Despite landing in Allston, though, he had studied English at the College and said in 2007 that he viewed his liberal arts background as an advantage in his career at the Los Angeles-based investment management firm Capital Group Companies.
“The deeper one gets into studying literature, the more one sees there’s no single right answer to a problem the way there is in mathematics or the sciences,” he told the University-run Harvard Gazette. “The creativity one exercises in analyzing works of literature and drawing conclusions about them is very valuable in the investment world where one is constantly faced with the task of making investment decisions based on imperfect knowledge.”
He went on to support research in the humanities through a fund that provides up to $200,000 annually for three years. Rothenberg was also one of six donors who contributed to the University-wide $50 million Challenge Fund that helps create new professorships. The University called him a “philanthropist of extraordinary generosity.”
Rothenberg is survived by his wife, Anne; three children, Catherine Rothenberg Wei, Erin Rothenberg Baker, and Daniel H. Rothenberg ’04; and six grandchildren.
