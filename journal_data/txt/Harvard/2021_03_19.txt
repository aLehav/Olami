After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rosé, the lead singer of Korean girl group Blackpink, has debuted — again. Except this time she, not her bandmate Jennie Kim, is going solo.
The New Zealand-born singer released the highly anticipated two-track single “R” last Friday, featuring two English songs: “Gone” and “On the Ground.” Her solo debut has been met with mixed reactions from her fan base, Blinks, whose members expected more from the single after nearly two years of waiting. A consensus remains: The track’s vocals and lyricism are all there, perhaps to the detriment of other flashier and trendier beats.
Nevertheless, the single is surprisingly refreshing and complements Rosé’s style perfectly, bringing out aspects of the singer’s range and character that her audience has never seen before.
“Gone” reveals a very emotionally vulnerable Rosé. “All my love is gone and the hate has grown,” she sings about the pain and loss that stuck around long after losing a first love. The line, “Another story that's sad and true,” gives us insight into just how personal and upfront the singer is being with this exposé. There is a breathy softness to this track’s melody that reflects that vulnerability. The singer croons about heartbreak, love, and loss to the backing of her signature guitar instrumentals, stripping the music bare and putting the spotlight on her unique vocals. The result from that harmony gives the song a soulful and relatable quality that cuts deep.
The lead single, “On the Ground,” sees Rosé reflecting on her career in that same candid regard. However, the energetic vibe of this track is inherently more hopeful compared to the complacent mellowness of “Gone,” symbolizing a more positive outlook on the future Rosé strives to confront in her walk of fame. “I worked my whole life ... just to be like / ‘Look at me, I'm never comin' down,’" she sings, referring to the naivete of the young Rosé who dreamt about being famous back in her trainee days under YG Entertainment. The older and wiser Rosé breaks that illusion, telling the audience that “You find out that your gold's just plastic” after you make it.
It sounds like a depressing track at first, but then the beat drops and Rosé the rapper makes an appearance in the ad libs of the chorus, suddenly uplifting the previously hopeless vibe. This time around, the blunt, honest lyrics contend with a quicker tempo and rougher 808 beat on the hook, bringing a sense of urgency to the track. The issue of stardom is not a lost cause for Rosé as she grapples between personal faith and public pressure: “Yeah, what goes up must come down / Nah, but they don't hear me though.” Rather, it’s an ongoing battle between being placed on the pedestal and bringing herself back down to earth, a constant struggle made more optimistic by the upbeat sonics.
While it’s true that its musical production isn’t groundbreaking, “R” does what it set out to do as a single: It puts the spotlight on Rosé and gives her the chance to prove herself as one of the best vocalists in the industry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 63rd annual Grammy Awards brought yet another year of disappointment. Not only did the Recording Academy’s voting members disrespect some nominees by denying them well-deserved wins, but they also failed to nominate some of the music industry’s most influential artists in the first place.
Yes, of course we can all celebrate the fact that Beyoncé became the female artist with the most Grammys ever, but when taking into account that it was her first win in a major category since 2010, it’s not quite as satisfying. Makes you think twice about Taylor Swift’s cryptic comment of “We’ll never forget you did this for us” after winning her third Album of the Year award, doesn’t it?
The cause of this controversial debacle is deeply rooted in a history of discrimination against women and Black artists, as well as a fundamentally flawed voting system that values critical acclaim over impact. This is perhaps best reflected in the poorly assembled rap and R&B categories, which have led to artists like the Weeknd, Nicki Minaj, and Kanye West refusing to participate or submit their work in the future. To celebrate unrecognized icons like these and more, here is a list of nominees and winners who really deserved to bring home those Grammys.
Best Pop Duo/Group Performance
If you’ve so much as opened Twitter in the past couple of days, you’ve probably seen the hashtag #scammys trending worldwide. This is because all over the world, the South Korean group BTS’ fandom, ARMYs, were left disappointed but not surprised after the Bangtan Boys did not win in the only category they were nominated for. Pretty audacious of the Recording Academy to ask the group to perform during prime time, advertising them front and center in between each commercial break to attract more viewers, only to ultimately not give them the Grammy — especially considering the fact that their nominated single “Dynamite” topped Billboard’s Digital Song Sales chart for months.
Album of the Year
What even are these nominations? Sure, “Future Nostalgia” was wildly successful on the charts and “Folklore” helped Swifties get through the pandemic, but Jacob Collier and Coldplay? Really? How about Bad Bunny’s “YHLQMDLG” that revolutionized the Latinx music industry? Or the Weeknd’s “After Hours,” which had already scored both AMA and MTV awards earlier this year? There were so many missed nominations that most of the nominated albums couldn’t even hold a torch next to.
Best Pop Solo Performance
According to The Recording Academy, the Best Pop Solo Performance Award is designed for pop recording from “some of pop music's most listened to artists, and ones whose songs have been on our playlists for months.” Look, Harry Styles had an amazing year and deserved to win his first Grammy to celebrate that, but his single “Watermelon Sugar” is not the one that should have taken home this prize. Not when the Weeknd’s “Blinding Lights” has had one hell of a record-breaking year, going viral on Tiktok to become an anthem for 2020 and winning him the Super Bowl LV halftime show. Tesfaye quite literally outsold and outperformed other nominees like Styles, Justin Bieber, and Dua Lipa.
Record of the Year
In the words of Billie Eilish, the winner of this Grammy herself: “This goes to her. Can we just cheer for Megan Thee Stallion?” This is the single most important award of the night, announced last and written about first in the media. That scale of impact must be reflected in the work which gets the win. For Eilish’s “Everything I Wanted,” this is not the case. Everything about Meg’s “Savage” — the creative mixing on the track, the collaboration with Queen Bey, the insane amount of sales, and the sheer Black excellence that went into producing this song — deserves a large-scale celebration akin to the Record of the Year award.
Best Rap Song
Having said that, however, “Savage” is not the best representative of rap music in this past year. It’s an amazing song to perform and dance to, and a wildly famous one at that, but that doesn’t necessarily translate to the cleanest flow or the most elaborate verses. With songs like Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later” under consideration, the nuances lie precisely in those details, which is why Drake and Lil Durk were more deserving of winning in this category. But The Recording Academy has never been particularly thorough in making the distinction between the artist and their work, so this wrongly awarded Grammy is unsurprising.

“Serotonin,” girl in red’s most recent single, shows leaps and bounds in the maturity and intensity of the singer-songwriter’s sound. As one of the pre-released singles from her upcoming first studio album, “if i could make it go quiet,” the song, released on March 3, stands alone as a pillar of the artist’s unique take on an alternative, pop approach. Even while living and working out of one of the happiest nations on earth — Norway — girl in red uses the song as a form of cathartic release for herself and for others. With this cry for help, she allows for her entire audience to empathize and step back from their struggles.
By using a similar style to artists like Doja Cat and Post Malone, girl in red takes advantage of her own talents as a gifted singer and rapper. As she bounces between singing and rapping, she even mixes the styles in a unique form of sing-rapping. The choruses flow as a more pop-typical song, while the bridge and verses slip more into a melodic style of rap. The constant style changes come across smoothly: a fluid transition used to emphasize the message of the lyrics while adding to the variety and depth of the track.
Taking a deeper look into the verses reveals what makes “Serotonin” a truly dark and deeply personal take on mental health struggles masked by a poppy, danceable melody. The first verse starts with, “I get intrusive thoughts like cutting my hands off / Like jumping in front of a bus / Like ‘How do I make this stop?’” The lyrics are troubling, a trend that continues throughout the song with a title like “Serotonin. With a first line like, “I’m running low on serotonin,” it’s no question that girl in red is trying to vocalize the feelings of a person in the throes of struggle.
Masking the dark and sad look into a too-common struggle with mental health with an upbeat and carefully crafted beat creates a meaningful but inviting song. At first listen, it might not even come across as a song with any negative connotations, however when the lyrics have their opportunity to shine through, the real message comes out. This subversion creates an interesting dichotomy between the happiness people strive and the negativity they experience far more often.
Throughout the three minute and two second piece, girl in red creates a truly exciting listening experience that could easily appear in a pop playlist without people so much as batting an eyelash. She pulls together an intentional mix of synth-heavy, distorted, aggressive verses that could clash against the more pop-like choruses with seamless transitions. To add to the character of the song, the singer even adds a flavor of her native Norwegian at the end. This bit comes across as an artful return to sanity even while switching into a language the vast majority of the world wouldn’t even recognize — it’s her normal and feels like a long-awaited sigh of relief.
“Serotonin” creatively subverts the expectation that the song will be a moody and emotional take similar to the rest of girl in red’s repertoire. While still deeply emotional, the song comes across as a superficially poppy and happy track with an ever-climbing chorus. Even the use of the word “capitulate” emphasizes the story of the song and the real-world implications — an overly complex word artfully used in a feeble attempt to come across as mature and learned. As listeners await the release of girl in red’s debut album, “Serotonin” is an exciting indicator of promise from another up-and-coming international artist.

In his latest book, “Homo Irrealis,” readers are given the opportunity to see acclaimed author André Aciman opening the door to his studio and life. Aciman excels in reflecting on his own work, dexterously exposing us to sophisticated analysis while maintaining accessibility for most readers. This series of 17 essays points towards the air of sentimentality that pervades much of Aciman’s works. All of the essays in this book are interspersed with autobiographical narratives that make Aciman’s writing come to life. Combining aesthetics, art, and his lived experience, Aciman paints the crucial pictures of his life as a writer, providing insight into his creative process and craft. The book draws on everything from film to poetry, illustrating the way Aciman conceives of his own work in particular and of art in general.
“Homo Irrealis” deals with irrealis moods, grammatical moods that refer to an event outside real time or, as the author puts it, "the might-have-been that never happened but isn’t unreal for not happening and might still happen, though we fear it never will and sometimes wish it won’t happen or not quite yet." This is the essence of the magic in Aciman’s novels, and it is certainly interesting to see a writer present himself so transparently. One would think that by telling us about his act, the magician might ruin his tricks, but like the best magicians, Aciman's act is not damaged in the least by his own revelations. Perhaps the magician comparison is not quite right. Magicians might know exactly what they are doing. Aciman does not. This is not to say that Aciman's work is blind; on the contrary, it means that his act is dealing with such wonders that, despite the fact he himself imbued his novels with this power, its magic is beyond comprehension.
Beginning by studying a poem he encountered in the underground subway of NYC, Aciman opens with the most sophisticated interpretative work of the book. Poetry is the beginning and end. Throughout the first ten essays, the reader will be carried away by the aesthetic reflections. Aciman's oniric tone is not limited to his novels; it extends throughout these essays and somehow is able, in the same way his characters do, to evoke the feelings of beauty, nostalgia, and even ecstasy — precisely those phenomena whose origins he aims to explain. The course of these reflections is aided by Aciman's own stories, deeply personal and intimate (almost more so than his fiction), which have fed the writer’s life with the magic that he writes into his work.
The reader would be carried by this flow until the end of the book were it not unfortunately interrupted by the 11th and 12th essays. The ideas revealed in these are almost certainly linked to some of the themes in the book, but for some reason they do not convey the same feeling and thought. Earlier in the book, Aciman’s ruminations on the cities of Alexandria and Paris are filled to the brim with the irrealis. This is not the case with his treatment of Saint Petersburg and New York in their respective essays. They almost leave the impression of an empty ritual instead of invoking once again the irrealis trance. Aciman’s writing on Dostoyevsky, Gogol, and Pushkin, although capable of conjuring the aura of their work, does not dissolve into the flow of his other essays. Thankfully, the author is able to redeem this interruption with the last five essays, which despite constituting only one fifth of the book, are most certainly the most illuminating ones. The book closes with the essay “Unfinished Thoughts on Fernando Pessoa,” where Aciman returns to poetry one last time only to flip the magic of the irrealis on its head, leaving the reader, like most good books do, pondering after the cover is closed.
The readers will find themselves inside Aciman’s train of thought as he narrates, in his psychological style, moments of his life that have shaped his inspirations. His visits to Rome and his reflections on Sigmund Freud’s own visits; his encounters with the poetry of Patrick Phillips, C.P. Cavafy, and Pessoa; the paintings of Sloan, Monet, and Corot; the writings of W.G. Sebald and Proust; the films of Rohmer; and even the music of Beethoven. “Homo Irrealis” is not only an exploration of the function of art, but an entire way of thinking, both embodied and disembodied. It is a brilliant exposition of that time outside of our own that is no less real than the timeline of facts — and for human beings, perhaps even more real.

Leading up to his death three years ago, Stephen Hillenburg, the creator of “Spongebob Squarepants,” was known for vehemently opposing the creation of any spinoff series from his show. Recently, though, creative control seems to have fallen solely to the executives at Nickelodeon, who — just as Disney has with the Marvel universe — plan to mine the town of Bikini Bottom for all its worth. With “Kamp Koral: Spongebob’s Under Years” airing on Paramount+, it seems obvious that Hillenburg’s final wishes weren’t granted; to make matters worse, there are a total of three Spongebob spinoffs planned.
However, despite his well-known wish, ‘Kamp Koral’ begins each of its stories with an addition to the regular title sequence: “created by Stephen Hillenburg.” It’s a seemingly feeble attempt to dispel the notion that the show was created against the wishes of that late, great animator, but this acknowledgement feels crude. However, upon further inspection, Hillenburg reportedly approved the idea for ‘Kamp Koral.’ According to the Executive Vice President of Animation at Nickelodeon Ramsey Naito, Hillenburg was credited for the project because “Kamp Koral is about friendship and it shares the origin story of how our Bikini Bottom friends all met." If Hillenburg’s real concern was the creation of an unimaginative show about former background characters when Spongebob was the only one with much of a detailed past, then perhaps “Kamp Koral” still works, honing in on Spongebob’s past.
Sadly, “Kamp Koral” seems to fall short of becoming a beloved classic like its predecessor. The comedy material in the different stories seems shallow and unremarkable, much unlike the original show. Of course, the original Spongebob (Tom Kenny) and Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) made their fair share of silly jokes, but they often feel more strained than lighthearted, unlike the original. In particular, “Kamp Koral” seems to overemphasize Patrick’s stupidity and ignorance. For example, in the beginning of episode four, “In Search of Camp Noodist,” Patrick complains, “No activities means no… something.” To say the least, it’s not funny — and this line of humor almost skirts the line of unenjoyable.
Making matters worse, “Kamp Koral” completely changed the animation style of the original show. Rather than going with the classic 2D style that people know and love from “Spongebob Squarepants,” the animators decided to go for a CGI, 3D option instead. Executive vice president of Nickelodeon Naito stated that the choice was made so that “Bikini Bottom could shine in a way we haven’t seen before.” Instead, it is an almost distracting choice that often breaks the story immersion and feels wrong for a show originally beloved by many for simplicity and unseriousness. At the conclusion of episode four, “Kitchen Sponge,” there’s a quick glimpse of Sandy Cheeks (Carolyn Lawrence) animated in the classic style and it feels like a breath of fresh air.
One thing the show succeeds with is the continued use of the same voice actors and characters from the original show. We still get to see Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown), Squidward (Rodger Bumpass), Mrs. Puff (Mary Jo Catlett), Plankton (Mr. Lawrence), Karen (Jill Talley), and Larry the Lobster (Mr. Lawrence) all up to their various shenanigans. The showrunners’ commitment to finding and getting the original voice actors is an admirable and exciting choice for “Kamp Koral.”
In general, “Kamp Koral” is an entertaining and enjoyable show. It does lack the pizazz and spunk of the original “Spongebob Squarepants” — most likely because Stephen Hillenburg is no longer writing — but there is hope as the show continues. Some of the episodes had that familiar spark of creativity and ingenuity from Nickelodeon’s most loved comedy. Hopefully, as the show continues, these episodes become the norm, not the exception.

“WandaVision” came to an end on March 5 in an action-packed, forty minute episode aptly titled “The Series Finale.” Although nothing particularly surprising happened, all of the plotlines were neatly tied up while still leaving room for Marvel to return to the franchise.
The episode picks up right where the last left off, with Agatha (Kathryn Hahn) facing off with Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) in an impressively VFX-heavy prolonged fight scene, a testament to the feature-film-level budget granted to this TV series.
As the episode cuts to Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) being held captive, one of the last of the mysteries of “WandaVision” finally gets cleared up. The appearance of Evan Peters as Pietro Maximoff was met with massive fan reactions, as Peters plays Peter Maximoff, Pietro’s equivalent in the X-Men movies. Unfortunately, his appearance was not the introduction of the X-Men into the Marvel Cinematic Universe that many were hoping for. As cool as the alternate universe crossover of Wanda’s brother showing up could have been, this outcome was pretty forgone, since something as major as the merging of the MCU Superhero and X-Men universes seems unlikely to happen through the backdoor of a TV series.
When Agatha frees the citizens of Westview from Wanda’s control, they surround her — eager to get revenge for being mind-controlled. This could have been a great moment, one that would force Wanda to confront the harm her grieving inflicted. Unfortunately, after a moment of horror from Wanda, she sets them all free and the moment falls to the wayside. After a quick and fun homage to “The Incredibles” where the Maximoff family action poses together, everyone splits off again and the episode loses focus on the characters in favor of elaborate shots and the non-stop action Marvel is known for.
In a brief reprieve from the action, Vision and Spectral Vision debate the Ship of Theseus thought experiment in a move that solidifies how Paul Bettany has had one of the weirdest careers ever through the MCU: going from recording audio clips as J.A.R.V.I.S. for the first "Iron Man,"to becoming a full-fledged Avenger in “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” to now starring in his own show. And luckily for him, the appearance of yet another Vision suggests he isn’t likely to lose his job soon.
In the sky, Wanda uses the same runes Agatha used to stop Wanda from using her powers in the prior episode in a move that’s emblematic of the finale: Wanda’s final battle-winning move is a nice moment and a rewarding payoff from a detail placed earlier in the season, but it’s unsurprising and underwhelming. Agatha’s comeuppance is fitting — she is turned into Agnes, the personality she adopted when inside of Wanda’s sitcom — and also quite a convenient way to store a villain for future reboots.
Next, the scene everyone knew was coming: Wanda’s goodbye to her family. They weren’t real (or they were real because Wanda loved them, or something in between) but Wanda still must release them from her spell. This wrap-up is thoroughly predictable, but still suitably tender and heartfelt. It does wrap up “WandaVision”’s themes of grief and love nicely as Wanda returns to the real world, heartbroken at the loss of her family but appreciative of the love that she shared with them. Vision put it best: “What is grief if not love persevering?”
In true Marvel fashion, however, the end was not the end. In a mid-credits scene, “WandaVision” hints that Monica Rambeau is likely to return. And in a post-credit scene, Wanda’s sons Billy and Tommy call out to her. This once again references the idea of the multiverse that Scarlet Witch is deeply connected to in the comics, as well as hinting at the upcoming Scarlet Witch appearance in “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”
It also poses a complicated question for Marvel: Will they require moviegoers to be familiar with the TV series, spoil the show’s ending to catch viewers up, or vaguely side-step their existence? Wanda’s development in this series is now integral to her character, her powers and her perception in the public — failing to acknowledge this in a future movie would be a disservice to her character, though Marvel has been known to arbitrarily retcon and abandon arcs in the past (for example, most of “Avengers: Age of Ultron”).
As “WandaVision” shifted to forty minute episodes, the sitcom pastiches faded into the background. While the show was undoubtedly strongest when it played with those expectations, “The Series Finale” was a satisfactory ending to the lovely journey between Wanda and Vision, and a great first entry in the MCU’s TV lineup.

From Memorial Hall and its Memorial Transept, to Memorial Church, to the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library, Harvard Yard has expanded from a backbone of remembrances — memories made material by the communities left behind.
Dedicated in 1874, Memorial Hall honors the 136 Harvard associates who fought in the Civil War and lost their lives for the Union cause. Four decades later, a grieving mother gifted funds for the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library — Widener to all students thereafter — as a tribute to her son Harry, an alumnus who drowned aboard the RMS Titanic. On Armistice Day in 1932, Memorial Church opened in memory of the Harvard men (and eventually, the Radcliffe women) who had died in World War I. The Church has since added tributes to University lives sacrificed in later wars: World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.
Generations of students, faculty, and staff have cycled into and out of the Yard since these commemorated individuals passed on — indeed, since many of the people with memories of them died too. But the structures they inspired remain intact and their remembrances endure. For, on occasion, the “memorial” name prompts us who stroll in front of those buildings to stop and spare a thought to their original purpose. I lived at Harvard for one fairly-reclusive semester, and even I passed all of those buildings and recalled their origins often.
In a normal year, I might not have spent so much time thinking about these three structures, but I feel a fierce kinship with the Harvard students of those pasts now. The anguish that death — of a common cause, of a scale impossible to envision, and of a lengthy period — can bring has again fixed itself in our national conversation. It has parked itself here at Harvard too. That kind of collective grief, so strong it supports memorials 100 years later, feels less removed from our experience than it once might have.
So far, my own grief has been isolated by necessity. As I doomscroll on Twitter or skim the newspaper at my desk, tributes and personal obituaries to pandemic victims bring tears. When I listened to President Joe Biden speak to our national tragedy once, and then again, on my computer, alone at the kitchen table with headphones in, I sobbed. I expect that I’ll cry again soon.
Online tributes to more than a half-million American individuals are, of course, not enough. They serve as make-shift substitutes until we can meet shoulder-to-shoulder. When that day comes, we will need to take more concrete steps to mourn and heal. We will need spaces to do so.
Communities and organizations across the country have assembled a few temporary memorial spaces. I am sure that many more permanent spots are in the works. Still, government projects advance bit by bit — it is likely that we will not see a permanent Covid memorial in our hometowns or at any place near Harvard for some time.
When we no longer need to distance, most students will return to (or in some cases, move into) our home here at Harvard. Faculty and staff will return to their routine places of work on campus. Our University might be the first community into which many of us re-integrate after the pandemic finally passes.
We will need a space in which our Harvard community can mourn together. We will need to process our personal sorrows and our collective grief — the University needs a Covid memorial. Harvard should put together a working group, composed of all the many stakeholders in our community, to assemble an effective memorial before the hustle of campus life returns in the fall. I envision a semi-permanent installation commemorating in some way the Harvard graduates, students, and employees who lost their lives, and all the bereaved Harvard associates who lost loved ones in the past year too.
I’ve encountered the stately precedents for Harvard memorials on my walks in the Yard, but memorials do not have to be that grand to be compelling. At the moment, speed of construction feels far more important than permanency. That can always come later. More Americans have died of Covid than died in World War I and World War II combined — we are hurting and our pain needs immediate attention.
The bells of Memorial Church were inscribed with the phrase “in memory of voices that are hushed.” When the bells ring, those are the individuals for whom they speak. I want us to remember the voices taken from our lives, and I want us to do so together too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Future Harvard Leftists,
If you’re like me when I was an admitted student, you’re apprehensive about attending Harvard. As a high school senior, I remember being worried that my ideological convictions and policy positions would be well outside of the mainstream on campus. As the deadline for deciding whether to commit to Harvard approached, I went searching for essays about the experience of leftist campus activists at Harvard. The few articles I found were either outdated, about not being able to find leftists on campus, or about giving up on leftism.
Don’t let your worries or these articles discourage you from attending Harvard. If you’re a leftist, this school is for you, too.
I won’t lie and tell you being a leftist at Harvard is easy. While I had an incredible freshman year and made life-long friends, I remember being quite politically lonely that year. The first political campus event I attended foreshadowed this experience. It was a debate between the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, and the Harvard College Libertarians. While they discussed issues of great importance including privacy in an age of mass surveillance and tax systems, to democratic socialists like myself, the event was a debate, as Noam Chomsky would say, between different factions of “basically one party — the business party.” More fundamental critiques of our economic system were absent. Democratic socialism’s draw for me is its willingness to reconstruct fundamental aspects of our society from property rights to the expansion of democracy into the workplace — whatever it takes to create a world, not with less, but no poverty, medical debt, environmental destruction, mass incarceration, etc.
Looking back, it’s not like the Harvard Political Union purposefully excluded left-wing ideas from the debate. As I would later learn, with around 40 recognized political campus organizations and none of them explicitly left-wing, there simply weren’t any clubs that year to voice such a political ideology.
When I took Professor Gregory Mankiw’s version of Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” — Harvard’s introductory economics course and one of its most popular courses — left-wing perspectives were notably absent from the curriculum. I’m certainly not the only one who felt this way as 70 students walked out of the class in 2011 to protest the course’s conservative bias.
Disappointed that my economics education lacked perspectives that questioned foundational aspects of our society, I reached out to Professor Stephen A. Marglin, Harvard’s only tenured radical economist. I immediately started to feel less politically isolated. He introduced me to readings on critical perspectives on development and modernization that expanded and reshaped what I thought was political and economically possible. If you ever feel trapped by mainstream economics’ insistence on marginal improvements to an economy you feel is fundamentally unjust, I recommend you visit his office hours as well.
Outside of academics, you can find a like-minded leftist community at Harvard — but you might have to build that community. Passionate about Bernie Sanders’s call for a political revolution, nine students and I founded Harvard for Bernie to support his 2020 presidential campaign. None of us were well-acquainted beforehand and each of us lived in different Houses and dorms. Bernie’s explicitly pro-working class policy proposals, including housing, healthcare, and college for all, were what brought us together.
At first, I had doubts that many Harvard students could be swayed towards supporting Senator Sanders, let alone democratic socialism. After all, Harvard, to a certain extent, is an epicenter for the reproduction of the dominant class. Our ultra-high net worth alumni, defined as having more than $30 million, hold $4.7 trillion of wealth, more than the UHNW alumni of Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and MIT combined. Just four years earlier, national polls showed that 59 percent of America’s college students supported Sanders and 18 percent supported Clinton in September of 2015 (before national support for Sanders nearly doubled). Harvard’s numbers, on the other hand, were nearly reversed: 67 percent of 2016 Harvard College graduates favored Clinton and just 28 percent favored Sanders at the time of Commencement. Clearly, this would be an uphill battle.
To my pleasure and surprise, Harvard for Bernie and the Bernie campaign were more popular in 2020 than I could have imagined. We campaigned hard, organized members to knock on every residential door on campus, hosted a conference on class warfare and the future of the left that attracted more than 800 attendees, and organized and won an Iowa Satellite Caucus in Harvard Square. By the end of the campaign, our email list was nearly 500 strong and Bernie was the most popular primary candidate among 2020 Harvard College graduates.
Obviously, Bernie’s improved success with Harvard students in 2020 was not entirely (or likely even mostly) due to the work we did. He simply ran a great campaign. Nor is this to say that Harvard students were particularly supportive of Senator Sanders or democratic socialism. While nationally 71 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning college students supported Sanders, the same was true for only 29 percent of the Democratic and Democratic-leaning 2020 Harvard College graduates, a 42 percent gap.
Over the last three years, I’ve participated in and watched the Overton window — the range of discourse and policies acceptable to the mainstream population — shift left. Others have noticed as well. On March 3, 2019, when Bernie Sanders, a self-declared socialist, was the unprecedented front-runner for the Democratic party nomination, New York Magazine published its cover article, “When did Everyone Become a Socialist?” That said, this leftward shift in the Overton window didn’t fully reach Harvard.
When you arrive on campus, I hope you’ll be the ones to finally shift the window of political possibility at Harvard to the left.
In Solidarity,

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I woke up on Monday morning, pretty much everything on my Twitter feed — which is comprised of a healthy cross-section of Asian Twitter and entertainment Twitter — was about the Academy Award nominations. Chloe Zhao, Steven Yeun, and Riz Ahmed’s faces dominated my morning news, their many broken records and Oscar firsts littering the headlines. The feeling in the room (to the extent that a bunch of Twitter threads counts as a room) was triumphant and jubilant: a celebration of the milestones that Asians and Asian Americans had finally achieved.
When I woke up on Wednesday morning, the feeling was quite different.
I spent a good portion of the day doom-scrolling, processing the deaths of those six Asian women in Atlanta. As Lulu Wang said, “I know these women. The ones working themselves to the bone to send their kids to school, to send money back home.” The more I read, the more I was haunted by how much their stories reminded me of my own mother — who, at the time I first heard the news, was at work at her job also in the service sector.
And despite this deluge of violence and tragedy, the headline from Wednesday that bothered me the most actually had nothing at all to do with the shootings in Atlanta, nothing to do with anti-Asian sentiment, violence, or discrimination. It was this one, from The New York Times:
“China’s latest vaccine is made from hamster ovary cells.”
The article, whose title has since been changed, describes how China had approved its fifth Covid-19 vaccine, which was, indeed, developed with cell lines derived from hamster ovary tissue. Absent from the headline, however, was the fact that Chinese hamster ovary cells are commonly used in medical research and, in fact, have been for decades.
I find it hard to believe that a seasoned, Pulitzer Prize-nominated New York Times reporter was unable to find this fact (which, I will add, took me all of about 30 seconds of Googling to discover). Regardless of whether it was intentional, this embodies the kind of soft racism that has pervaded coverage of Asians and Asian Americans throughout this past year.
It’s President Trump’s insistence on calling Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and the “Kung-flu.” It’s the opinion pieces and article illustrations that paint China as a nefarious, dystopian threat. It’s the careless misspellings of Asian names. It’s the story that has infinite versions — getting called a ch*nk on the subway, a friend asking if you eat dog, being told to “go back home” when America is the only home you’ve ever known. The disrespect and dehumanization are gradual, but when they persist for centuries, tragedies like Tuesday’s should come as no surprise.
And all of this is further complicated by the model minority myth: the very convenient (and completely false) belief that all Asians have achieved success through some combination of hard work, grit, and immigrant pixie dust — and that you, too, [insert other marginalized minority group here], can achieve this American Dream if you just work hard like them! I hope that I don’t need to point out the many flaws in this logic (though this article does), but the damage done by the model minority myth is very real — to Asian Americans, who are viewed as invulnerable to racism, and to other minority groups, who are denigrated for not “working hard enough.”
Returning to Hollywood, it’s interesting to observe the rise of shows like “Bling Empire” and “House of Ho,” which both follow well off Asians, through the lens of the model minority myth. It’s worthwhile to ask, in this oft-celebrated post-“Crazy Rich Asians” era of Asian representation: How can we eradicate the model minority myth if the only Asian stories are ones of success and wealth? If the stories of low-wage, female Asian workers like Daoyou Feng, Hyun Jung Grant, Xiaojie Tan, and Julie Park continue to be overlooked? It’s progress, sure, from the fetishization and offensive stereotypes of decades past, but it’s far from enough.
I am a second-generation Chinese American, yes, but I am also a writer, a journalist, and the Arts Chair of The Harvard Crimson. And what I think this all ultimately comes down to is, in fact, storytelling. How we tell stories about Asians and Asian Americans — whether real and fictional, whether in a news article or in a blockbuster movie — shapes how we’re treated. It’s not hard to draw lines between news articles that frame Chinese values as an existential threat to America and increased anti-Asian violence. Nor is it hard to see how the hypersexualization of Asian women in movies and TV shows encourages murderers like Robert Aaron Long, who claims to have been motivated by “sexual addiction.”
I address this op-ed not to people like Long, not to the incels or white supremacists, but rather, to my co-workers. To the writers and journalists and filmmakers of the world: Words matter, and how we tell Asian and Asian American stories matters. Spell names correctly. Do research. Challenge the model minority myth. Hire people to tell their own stories. Call out racism for what it is, and do not mince words. Think about the repercussions of what you put out into the world because — as Tuesday’s events have made abundantly clear — the consequences can be life or death.

Harvard researchers have found evidence that supermassive black holes move, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal last week.
The study was conducted by researchers at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Princeton University, the University of Utah, and the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics in Potsdam, Germany.
The researchers compared the velocities of several black holes with the velocities of the galaxies in which they are situated. The results showed that for one of the galaxies, the stars and gas at its center were not moving at the same velocity as its black hole, suggesting that the black hole was moving independently of the galaxy.
Dominic W. “Dom” Pesce ’12, a Harvard postdoctoral fellow who led the study, wrote in an email that this independent movement implies the supermassive black hole has interacted with another black hole of a similar mass.
“An SMBH that is moving with respect to its host galaxy is a strong indication that the system is either about to experience a SMBH binary merger, or that it has recently done so,” Pesce wrote. “Either scenario provides exciting indirect evidence for the reality of SMBH merger events — which have yet to be directly detected — and therefore also evidence of a specific mechanism for SMBH growth.”
Co-author and astronomer James A. “Jim” Braatz also proffered his assessment of the supermassive black hole.
“The nature of that interaction is probably related to a merger of galaxies. In other words, there was probably another galaxy that kind of swung close to this one. It also had a black hole in its center and those black holes interacted and they can kind of give each other a gravitational kick and move away from center,” he said.
Scientists have long posited the presence of supermassive black holes that move relative to their galaxies but have had trouble observing them clearly up until now.
“This galaxy where we actually see the black hole moving relative to the galaxy is very exciting because people have been looking for these cases for a long time,” according to Jenny E. Greene, a co-author and a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton.
Moving forward, Pesce said the team will search through data gathered from a network of space and Earth based radio antennae for emissions from another supermassive black hole.
Greene said there are “two paths” for future inquiry.
“One is to dig deeper on this galaxy and try to figure out what happened in its past to cause this black hole to be moving,” she said. “The other big challenge is to find more cases of moving black holes.”

Boasting an improved ventilation system and expanded dining spaces, renovations to Claverly Hall of Adams House wrapped up earlier this month, marking the end of the first of three phases of the House’s renewal project.
The completion of Claverly Hall — which was originally slated to finish in August 2020 — comes nearly a year after the project was temporarily suspended due to a city-wide construction moratorium implemented in wake of mounting fears of coronavirus spread. Work resumed after a five-month hiatus in August 2020.
Before the pandemic, the Adams House Renewal Project was scheduled to span four years and three distinct phases, ultimately concluding in fall 2023. Due to the unforeseen delays, however, the project will now tentatively be complete in 2025.
Randolph Hall will undergo the next phase of construction after Apthorp House — the 260-year-old faculty dean residence — is finished this summer. Construction on Westmorly Hall and Old Russell Hall will ensue shortly thereafter.
Adams House Faculty Dean John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said in an interview last week that, though Harvard began the architectural plan about four years ago, the process of renovating the entire House is expected to take six or seven years.
“We have actually completed the architectural plans. They’re spectacular,” Palfrey said. “But because of Covid, and because of the fact that this is three blocks of Cambridge, and there are all sorts of other complications, we have just completed — or in a week or two — will complete Claverly, which is the first block.”
Stephen L. Needham, executive director of the Undergraduate House Renewal Program, said construction on Claverly Hall was completed ahead of the proposed fall 2021 deadline.
“We have our own internal team, we have the contractors, and then we have the architects — we all worked together to come up with a plan, so we were able to restart the project in the summer,” he said. “And rather than finish around November, we finished in March.”
Palfrey described the interior of the renovated Claverly Hall as “shiny and lovely.”
“Everything outside will look as it did before,” Palfrey said. “Inside, however, will look modestly different in Claverly in that it will be shiny and smooth, and the floors redone, and the woodwork redone, and the stairwell and the skylight redone.”
Palfrey noted that the renovations done on Claverly Hall will make the building more accessible to students with disabilities.
“Claverly will have three elevators in it, and it only had one elevator about the size of a peanut before,” he said. “The other houses will also have elevators and things, because there was essentially no square inch of Adams House which was handicapped accessible before. And it will be completely accessible after we’re done with the renovation.”
According to Needham, the newly renovated Claverly Hall is also more sustainable. The building earned LEED gold status, the second-highest distinction offered by the sustainability certification group.
Esther J. Xiang ’23, who has been living on campus in Adams House, said she believes the character of Adams House has been preserved throughout the renovation process.
“I’ve seen so many pictures, and it’s so beautiful,” she said. “The character of Adams hasn’t changed. It hasn’t been lost at all. You still get the Adams feel, which is really great.”

Harvard College financial aid representatives shed light on the process for requesting additional aid amid changing financial circumstances for students during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Though the College declined to disclose the number of students whose financial aid situations had changed, a survey conducted by The Crimson in 2020 indicated that 16.2 percent of respondents had family who lost employment or were furloughed during the pandemic. Per the financial aid office, around 55 percent of all students are currently on some form of aid.
Director of Financial Aid Jake Kaufmann ’93 said the College, as an “entirely need-based” institution, awards financial aid solely on a family’s financial circumstance.
“This year hasn't been as big of a financial shift for people as I might have expected, but of course, I was expecting the worst,” Kaufmann said.
“Things aren’t over yet,” he added. “I think that the places where job losses have happened, furloughs have happened, haven't necessarily converted into appeals for more aid yet, but I'm guessing that they will.”
The College evaluates a student’s financial aid award on a yearly basis; however, students whose family circumstances may have changed can request a reconsideration of their financial aid award.
“We have students where you've got a parent who's lost a job and a significant income change that looks like it might extend for a while,” Kaufmann said. “We can be responsive to that, and by responsive, I mean provide more aid.”
According to Kaufmann, the financial aid committee meets weekly on Wednesdays to review students’ appeals for more aid and aims to respond to student outreach within 24 hours. The College’s policy toward financial aid appeals, however, is “reactive” rather than “proactive,” he said.
“It's sort of – I hate to say – a wait-and-see, which is very stressful for the family,” Kaufmann said. “But we obviously need to be reactive and responsive to the financial need versus actually to the [family’s] story.”
As a student whose family’s annual income is less than $65,000 – the threshold to receive full financial aid from the College – Jaden D. “JD” Deal ’23 said he has remained on full financial aid since the pandemic began.
“I have literally never reached out,” Deal said. “I've not really had the need to, just because I know what my family makes is going to be below the threshold.”
Jordan H. Barton ’23, who is also a recipient of a full financial aid package, said he was personally fine with his aid situation, though he knew others who were less than satisfied.
“I know that some people are comfortable with the amount of money Harvard's reduced from the nominal price that they'd be charging people,” Barton said. “But similarly, I know that students that receive less aid that are in similarly economic disprivileged situations or in newly economic disprivileged situations due to the pandemic, certainly do not feel like that the financial aid office has been like an ally to them.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in a December 2020 interview he believes Harvard’s larger aid package was one reason why the College saw a surge in early action applications this fall. Kaufmann noted that unlike other colleges, many of the officers who work in the financial aid office double as admissions officers.
“It's a very unusual model,” Kauffman said. “We think it strengthens our admissions process and financial aid officers understanding students, student life, who's coming to Harvard, and how to support students best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 19, 2021 at 2:00 p.m.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow declined to provide details on the circumstances that led to the departure of Cornel R. West ’74, citing confidentiality policies, but defended Harvard’s existing tenure process in a Thursday interview.
West, a professor of the practice of public philosophy at Harvard Divinity School, announced on March 8 that he would leave his post for a tenured position at the Union Theological Seminary after he said the University declined to take up his case for tenure consideration.
“Cornel was a valued member of our community — a terrific teacher, valued colleague. And I wish him well,” Bacow said.
But Bacow declined to comment on any of the specifics of West’s case, despite ambiguity surrounding the process that preceded his departure.
West served as a professor at Harvard for eight years — including four as a University Professor, Harvard’s highest faculty position — before leaving the school in 2002 after a dispute with then-University President Lawrence H. Summers. When West returned in 2017, he was named a Professor of the Practice, an untenured position.
West told The Crimson on March 9 that a committee evaluating him for reappointment to the untenured role recommended that the University “immediately initiate” a review considering him for tenure but the request was denied. He also claimed that Harvard offered to consider him for tenure after he publicly threatened his departure.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain told the Boston Globe on Feb. 18 that the committee did not have the authority to consider West for tenure. Three members of the committee wrote in an emailed statement last week that Harvard’s characterization of the committee’s report was “technically accurate” but failed to provide the full picture.
Still, University administrators and spokespeople have repeatedly declined to comment on the specifics of West’s case, citing a policy of confidentiality for individual tenure cases.
“We don’t comment on tenure or promotion cases,” Bacow said Thursday. “They’re conducted in the strictest of confidence, and it would be inappropriate for me to breach that confidence with respect to any specific case.”
Bacow defended Harvard’s tenure process, which has faced scrutiny for its lack of transparency.
“The tenure process has served Harvard well for generations,” he said. “We enjoy the quality of faculty that we do largely because of it, and I think it’s a process that works well.”
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences launched a review of Harvard’s tenure process last January at the request of over 100 faculty members. The review, which is expected to be released this spring, came after the tenure denial of Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña sparked outrage among students and ethnic studies scholars.
But FAS Dean Claudine Gay told The Crimson last March that the review will not examine Harvard’s use of ad hoc committees — confidential faculty committees which comprise one of the final steps in most tenure cases and have been the subject of criticism in the past — because they are held at the University level.
Bacow and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 hold the final say over all tenure decisions. In an interview with The Crimson last month, prior to West’s announced departure, Garber defended the use of the ad hoc committees.
“The use of ad hoc committees at Harvard has a very long history,” Garber said on March 5. “Having had deep involvement in the tenure process at another university, I believe the ad hoc process is thorough and fair — and one that works exceedingly well.”
Garber previously served as a professor of medicine and of economics at Stanford University.
“There is no tenure process, including our own, that is flawless,” Garber said. “And we constantly seek to improve how we approach these processes — and we will continue to do so going forward.”
CORRECTION: March 19, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that West said Harvard offered him tenure following his public threats to depart the University. In fact, West stated that Harvard offered to consider him for tenure following the public pressure.

In 2000, Harvard submitted the sole bid to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority to claim 48-acres of dormant land in Allston. After securing the large tract of land for the lofty sum of $151,751,636, Harvard officially owned more property in Allston than it did in Cambridge.
Twenty-one years later — and just after the opening of Harvard’s state-of-the-art Science and Engineering Complex in the neighborhood — the University continues to have big plans for its Allston property, including an Enterprise Research Campus, the Allston Multimodal Project, and a new stop on the Framingham/Worcester commuter rail line. Here is a brief synopsis of steps the University and the developers had to take to get these projects approved with the city of Boston, and what hurdles Harvard must pass next.
Harvard undergoes two different planning processes for new developments on University-owned land: the institution master plan and the permitting process.
The institution master plan is specifically designed for developments that would serve the University’s “academic or athletic or support facilities,” according to Gerald Autler, a senior project manager at the Boston Planning and Development Agency.
By contrast, there is a separate “permitting process” for projects like the ERC, in which Harvard hires an external firm such as Tishman Speyer to develop University-owned land into “commercial, residential, and other non-institutional” space.
Governing both these processes is Article 80 of the Boston Zoning Code, which Autler said outlines “the procedures for small projects and large projects and how they need to be reviewed.”
Though the review process for smaller developments is “straightforward,” larger institutional projects or projects with external developers begin “long before” any official construction plans are filed.
Nupoor Monani, a senior institutional planner at the BPDA, said the ERC review began with the University filing documents in 2018 to establish a planned development area.
“That [PDA filing] describes, very broadly, the contours of the development — how big is it, how many square feet, what uses will it have, and what benefits will it provide to the community,” Monani said.
Alex Krieger, professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and former co-chair of the Allston Work Team, said the University developed the idea for the ERC after realizing it had acquired more land in Allston than it needed for academic purposes.
“Harvard had acquired much more land than they would ever need for their academic purposes, for university purposes,” Krieger said. “And, therefore, there’s an opportunity to delegate to sort of a plan for some of that space to become partners with industry and so forth.”
Once a project is proposed, the BDPA facilitates planning and conducts “development review,” per Monani.
In its planning capacity, the BPDA takes on the traditional role of an urban planner to consider how the city is changing project-by-project and to define parameters for new developments through zoning codes and other guidelines, according to Monani.
Monani added that, acting as a development reviewer, the BPDA aims to ensure that the developer “seeks input from all different stakeholders.” In the case of Harvard’s expansion into Allston, those include Harvard-Allston Task Force, which is a resident-led impact advisory group.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association and member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said he believes the group has considerable sway over project plans.
“We have a much more integrated, complex community review process that could really make life difficult for Harvard, if we were ignored,” he said.
Part of the task force’s role, according to Monani, is to review the developer’s filings.
Last month, she said, residents considered and submitted comments on the project notification form filed by Tishman Speyer — the ERC’s primary developer. The 266-page document details the first phase of construction, which will focus on approximately six acres of land within the planned development area. The second phase, “phase B,” is still in its conceptual state, but Tishman Speyer has “secured the right to pursue entitlements,” per the form.
Using resident comments and input from local city councillors and stakeholders, Monani added, the BPDA will compile a “scoping determination,” which outlines “gaps in the analysis of impacts and mitigation” the developer should address in subsequent filings.
Harvard’s developer, per Monani, will work with local residents and public officials to create a “community benefits package,” which describes the development’s potential negative effects and offers corresponding mitigation measures.
Assuming the developer fleshes out its mitigation plans thoroughly, Monani said, the plans will go to the BPDA board for approval. The board can choose to approve the project, “table it” to be considered following further impact analysis, or reject the project — an outcome she said is very rare.
For the review process to have “legal standing,” lawyers must draft planning contracts to be signed by all of the involved parties, including the developers, the BPDA, and the Harvard-Allston Task Force.
Following planning approval, developers must put forth their ideas before the BPDA again — this time for construction — in order to seek a permit to break ground, Monani said.
Per the form, Tishman Speyer will begin construction on the ERC in 2022. This first phase will consist of developing the six acres of the land into a hotel, conference center, residential buildings, retail, and public green space. The Harvard Allston Land Company will begin construction of “streets, sidewalks, and other utility infrastructure elements” in 2021.
For a project the size of Harvard’s vision for Allston, Monani said it is difficult to estimate how long construction will last because of myriad “externalities that impact the construction timeline.”
Fluctuations in the economy, for example, can impact a project’s timeline.
“There have been a number of projects in Boston’s history — well, not a large number, but certainly some significant ones — where you’ve dug a hole in the ground, and then, bam, a recession hits,” she said. “What do you do? You can’t get financed, so you just stop.”
Monani said one of the “biggest unknowns” regarding the ERC’s development is the turnpike that runs through Allston, which she said has been a “big impediment for Harvard.”
Despite potential obstacles such as that one, Monani said she is determined to work with the developer to “make sure the community feels comfortable with the direction we're going in.”
“What we have seen so far is that Tishman Speyer is a willing partner in working through this project with us. They’ve been responsive to the needs of the community,” she said. “We’re all trying our hardest to make it happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and its graduate student union held their first bargaining session for a second contract Thursday, reopening negotiations just nine months after the two sides agreed on a first contract.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers filed a notice of intent to bargain on the second contract Feb. 12. The union is currently voting internally on bargaining priorities and will use the results to draft initial proposals.
Harvard is one of five graduate student unions that has successfully negotiated a first contract, with the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Automobile Workers still in negotiations. HGSU-UAW recently threw its support behind GWC-UAW’s decision to begin a strike Monday over the negotiations with Columbia.
After almost two years of negotiations and the longest graduate student strike in recent history, Harvard’s graduate students voted to ratify their first contract on June 30, 2020. Due to the unusual circumstances created by the pandemic, the contract is a one-year agreement expiring June 30, 2021.
Out of the 10 HGSU-UAW bargaining committee members, Statistics Ph.D. candidate Cory W. McCartan is the only one who was at the bargaining table for the union’s first contract.
The first agreement between HGSU-UAW and the University guarantees student workers 2.8 percent wage increases, access to health care funds and childcare subsidies, and access to personal protective equipment. It also protects student workers reporting unsafe work conditions from retaliation.
A longstanding point of contention between Harvard and HGSU-UAW in the previous round of negotiations was the grievance procedure for sexual harassment and identity-based discrimination. The union has advocated for a third party to handle such claims, while the University insisted they can be processed through Harvard’s existing procedures.
Though the first agreement does not include provisions for a third-party arbitration as proposed by the union, student workers under the first contract can have a union representative present in all stages of the grievance.
The union had also hoped the first contract would include provisions for an “union shop,” which would require student workers to pay dues for representation at the bargaining table. The current agreement, however, maintains an “open shop” arrangement in which members can choose whether or not to pay dues. HGSU-UAW is the only open shop union at Harvard.
After ratification, the University became responsible for providing HGSU-UAW with a weekly list of students in its bargaining unit, as well as deducting membership dues from paychecks. Last fall semester, union leadership noticed that some students at the School of Public Health were not having dues deducted from their paychecks, and eventually discovered that 108 students in the Population Health Sciences program were being excluded from the bargaining unit. HGSU-UAW filed a grievance over the exclusion in December 2020.
In January 2021, the University denied the grievance, and the next month the union filed for a Step Two grievance, which Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 will mediate. Harvard maintains the compensation the excluded students receive does not make them employees of the University, pointing to the difference between labor and “academic effort.”
HGSU-UAW has also raised concerns about health and safety during the pandemic. Union and Harvard representatives met in February to discuss access to mental health care and specialist care, as well as contact tracing protocols and protections for student workers working remotely.
While the health and safety meeting was distinct from contract negotiations, HGSU-UAW representatives told The Crimson following that meeting that health and safety would be key priorities for the union as it begins to bargain the second contract.
With the inauguration of Joe Biden, the second round of contract negotiations is anchored in a much friendlier national environment for organized labor than that of the first round.
During Donald Trump’s presidency, several graduate student movements withdrew their petitions to unionize, including the University of Pennsylvania and University of Chicago. They said they feared that the National Labor Relations Board under Trump would use their cases to revoke graduate students’ right to unionize altogether. In September 2019, the NLRB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking stating that students “who perform any services for compensation, including, but not limited to, teaching or research, at a private college or university in connection with their studies are not ‘employees’” under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.
Since taking office, Biden fired Trump-appointed NLRB general counsel Peter B. Robb and deputy general counsel Alice B. Stock, naming Peter Sung Ohr as the new acting general counsel.
Eighteen months after the 2019 notice of proposed rulemaking under Trump, the NLRB under Biden withdrew the proposed rule on Monday.
Former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV said he believes the current labor environment will generally give graduate student unions more leverage at the bargaining table because they can now seek recourse with the NLRB.
“Now that dynamic has changed, so I think the union doesn’t have the same limitations imposed upon it that existed these past four years,” Gould said.
HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said in a January interview that the national labor conditions establish the tone for organizing, but do not determine the direction of the union’s work.
Last month, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that administrators “look forward” to negotiating with the union this year.
“The University continues to work with HGSU-UAW on the implementation of the contract that went into effect last July, and we look forward to engaging in the upcoming discussions around its renewal this year,” he wrote.
Garber said in an interview earlier this month that he is “very optimistic” going into the negotiations, and indicated the University is willing to bargain over some mental health initiatives with the union.
HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Aparna Gopalan wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that the union is “happy” the University is willing to negotiate for the second contract.
“We had our first session and are going to have more in coming weeks,” Gopalan wrote. “We were happy to hear that the University is willing to work quickly together to get a second contract in place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Coalition for a Diverse Harvard — an alumni group centered on increasing diversity and promoting equity at the University — endorsed five candidates for this year’s Board of Overseers election and six candidates for elected directorships on the board of the Harvard Alumni Association on Wednesday.
The Board of Overseers serves as the University’s second highest governing body. The Harvard Alumni Association Nominating Committee named eight candidates for the five anticipated vacancies on the Board, and three additional candidates backed by Harvard Forward — a student and alumni organization working to call attention to climate action and racial justice issues within the University’s governance boards — joined the ballot through a petition process.
The Coalition endorsed U.S. Circuit Judge Raymond J. Lohier Jr. ’88, Vote Latino founding president and CEO María T. Kumar, business executive and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Sheryl WuDunn, United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance Mark J. Carney ’87, and global health specialist Yvette O. Efevbera.
This marks the sixth year the Coalition has endorsed candidates for the Board of Overseers election.
Ten other alumni organizations co-signed the Coalition’s endorsements: First Generation Harvard Alumni, Harvard Arab Alumni Association, Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, Harvard Black Alumni Society, Harvard Gender and Sexuality Caucus, Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance, Harvard Progressive Jewish Alumni, Harvard South Asian Alumni Alliance, Harvard Tamil Sangam Alumni, and Harvard University Muslim Alumni.
The Coalition’s endorsements were determined by a 10-person candidate review committee that conducted video interviews and reviewed answers to a diversity questionnaire to determine its selections, according to Michael G. Williams ’81, who serves on the organization’s board.
Of the 11 candidates endorsed this year, eight are members of the Coalition. All but one of the Coalition’s endorsed Board of Overseers candidates belong to the organization.
The Coalition’s priorities include the developing ethnic studies programming at Harvard, promoting race-conscious admissions policies, and urging greater transparency from the Overseers.
“When we look at the five people that we’ve endorsed, we really think it’s a powerhouse group,” Williams said. “We think that this group of five candidates really can play a very important role in the Overseers in terms of the mission of the Coalition.”
The Coalition only backed one of the candidates who joined the ballot by petition, Efevbera.
“Doctor Efevbera was, and is, a stellar candidate, in part because of her very longstanding connections to the University,” Williams said. “She, obviously, is a member of the three people running through Harvard Forward, but for her in particular, we felt that she had a very strong contribution that she would be able to make as an Overseer on the issues related to diversity, inclusion, and equity.”
The other two candidates supported by Harvard Forward — Megan H. Red Shirt-Shaw and Natalie Unterstell — did not receive an endorsement from the Coalition.
“We’re thrilled that the Coalition has decided to recognize Yvette’s inspiring work by choosing to support her candidacy,” Harvard Forward co-founder Nathán Goldberg Crenier ’18 wrote in a statement. “At the same time, all three of our candidates are fully committed to ensuring that diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as racial and climate justice, are guiding values of the university, and their track records in their respective fields speak for themselves.”
The Coalition also endorsed six candidates for the Harvard Alumni Association’s elected directorships, including television writer and producer Margaret Williams “Maiya” Verrone ’84, human resources business partner at Curriculum Associates Hannah M. Park ’13, spaceport development lead at SpaceX’s south Texas launch site Jane A. Labanowski ’17, Founding Director of the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT Tenzin Priyadarshi, CareDx senior director of business development George A. Thampy ’10, and ViacomCBS executive Whitney S. F. Baxter ’07.
Elections are scheduled to open April 1 and close May 18 and will be conducted both online and through traditional paper ballots. All Harvard degree holders will be eligible to vote in the Overseers election, with the exception of members of the Harvard Corporation and alumni currently in University instruction or governance positions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Julia S. Friedman ’21, the moment of submitting her thesis in Psychology felt “anticlimactic.”
“I just attached it — attached the file — and then sent it in, and I was alone in my room, and I called my mom,” she said.
For members of the Class of 2021, virtual thesis submission is the latest in a string of quintessential experiences at the College that have been blighted by Covid-19. Though the College invited seniors to live on campus in the spring, not all opted to do so, and large social gatherings remain prohibited.
“I don’t think it had the same feeling as if I were on campus,” Friedman said. “I took the night off and watched some TV, but it wasn’t that exciting.”
Diana Myers ’21 said she, too, felt she missed out on the traditional experience of submitting a thesis. In the History and Literature Department, seniors typically hand in their binders, take photographs to post on Twitter, and have a “champagne party.”
“This year, it was just me sitting in a dorm room, hitting a button on Canvas, which was kind of sad,” she said.
Eliza C. Rubin ’21, who wrote a History of Art and Architecture thesis, said it was “disheartening” not to have “any of the pomp and circumstance” of submission — especially on top of other experiences she lost throughout the thesis process.
“You don’t get to meet with your advisor, you don’t get to reserve a carrel in Widener and have all your books in front of you,” Rubin said. “It just feels in some ways like writing a really long essay.”
Friedman also said she missed the camaraderie that senior thesis writers typically experience in spaces like Widener and Lamont.
“It felt isolating because everyone’s all throughout the world just working on their theses by themselves, whereas in a normal semester everyone would kind of be coming together,” she said. “There were definitely times when I felt like I was alone doing it.”
Ethan S. Medlin ’21, however, said the unusual circumstances of his senior year did not detract from the significance of completing his thesis in Economics.
“It was an interesting experience during this time, but I don’t feel like it took away from it at all,” he said. “It honestly allowed me to focus on my thesis a bit more and just make it that much more exciting when we finished.”
For other seniors, the pandemic had a significant impact on their academic process — requiring them to complete their research in the face of canceled trips and closed labs.
Myers said she initially “felt a sense of loss” over her inability to conduct research in France.
“I was really ready to get my hands on these medieval manuscripts,” she said. “Then as I worked on it over winter break, I realized that there was enough stuff in the libraries here and online that I was able to write a thesis I was proud of.”
Limits on in-person interaction required Chihiro Ishikawa ’21, a joint concentrator in Sociology and East Asian Studies, to conduct interviews via Zoom, a platform that she said can feel “alienating.”
But Ishikawa said she was still able to connect with her subjects, Japanese and Korean feminist activists.
“I was actually able to form some emotional bonds that I only thought I could form in offline spaces,” she said. “That was really a very surprising finding for me."
Priscilla S. Samey ’21, meanwhile, made up for her inability to perform ethnographic research in England by adopting a quantitative methodology for her Social Studies thesis.
“I had to learn a bunch of new methods — I had to learn how to code — and other skills I’m going to keep even after the thesis,” Samey said. “It was hard to sort of have to start over from scratch, but at the same time it definitely made the experience more valuable.”
After losing access to an in-person lab, Taylor D. Shirtliff-Hinds ’21 had to shift her Neuroscience thesis from experimentation on mice to a computational format, which she said was “very jarring.”
“I still feel very proud of myself for making do with a tough situation, but we really had to pivot, and my project is only a fraction of what I had dreamed of completing,” she said.
With her thesis behind her, Shirtliff-Hinds said she felt “like a huge weight has been lifted off [her] shoulders.”
“This is definitely the biggest project that I’ve ever completed to date — and so it has been great to have that finished, printed, and submitted,” she said.
Reflecting on the completion of her thesis, Samey said she felt “wonderful,” despite the fact that it has “been harder to celebrate” — especially without a spring break.
“Even though I really wanted to be able to take a rest and enjoy the fact that I just finished this huge accomplishment, I still have midterms to do, I still have class,” she said.
Despite the challenges wrought by Covid-19, many seniors said they still plan to participate in one famed tradition — taking photos with their manuscripts on the steps of Widener.
“Once it’s sunnier, I’m gonna go take pictures on Widener steps, because I feel like if you don’t do that, did you really write a thesis?” Friedman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators responded to the rise in anti-Asian violence and hate crimes since the onset of the pandemic last year in a series of emails calling for the University to come together in support of Asian American and Pacific Islander students.
Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit which tracks hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, reported 3,795 anti-Asian hate crimes in the past year. Footage of Asians and Asian Americans being attacked or facing racial slurs have circulated on social media, and on Tuesday, a white gunman killed eight people — six of them Asian women — in three spas in the Atlanta area. Police continue to investigate whether to classify the attack as a hate crime.
In a Thursday email to Harvard affiliates, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the “senseless murders” and other acts of violence were “fueled by racist rhetoric.” He called on Harvard to stand with Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders against hatred and racism.
“We must continue to find ways to not only support each other when these heinous crimes occur, but we must work to build a community of care and solidarity towards changing the course for our future,” Khurana wrote.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow called on Harvard affiliates in a Thursday email to stand together to counter hatred and support AAPI students who are feeling “targeted and vulnerable.”
“I long for the day when I no longer have to send such messages. It is our collective responsibility to repair this imperfect world,” he wrote.
In a separate Thursday email, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay referred to the Chinese Exclusion Act to show that the “violence has a history.” Gay wrote that the rise in hate crimes incited by anti-Asian rhetoric “stuns [her] to silence” and that she stood in solidarity with the AAPI community.
“As a society it is past time to reckon with a history that has denied Asian-Americans the respect and dignity that is a shared birthright,” Gay wrote. “Until we confront it, and until we commit to the necessary work of repair, we will never achieve the promise of a more perfect union.”
Tram Nguyen ’22, a Harvard Vietnamese Association adviser, said she felt “anger and frustration and sadness” after the Atlanta spa attacks. Still, they are not an isolated incident during the pandemic or in American history, Nguyen noted.
“This anti-Asian hatred has been entrenched in our country, in our society, since the existence of what it means to be Asian, an Asian American in this country. It is entrenched in our laws and institutions,” she said.
Harvard Korean Association co-president Sandra Moon ’22 wrote in an email that the events were “angering, upsetting, and overwhelming.”
“It’s frustrating to feel helpless, and infuriating to think of what has been tolerated and overlooked leading to such a terrible incident like this shooting to occur,” she wrote.
In this time, Nguyen said she hopes Harvard will prioritize the mental health of Asians and Asian Americans through counseling resources and developing a system for Asian students — and those of other marginalized groups — to report instances of hate and discrimination.
Linda K. Lin ’24, political and education chair of the Asian American Association, said she appreciated that the administrators’ emails brought the issue of anti-Asian hatred to students’ attention following the Atlanta spa attacks.
Still, she said the racism and prejudice revealed by the attacks are an “everyday thing” for her and other Asian Americans.
“This is an everyday thing, but people just simply don’t have the psychological capacity to care about social justice issues every single day,” Lin said. “Those emails are just a reminder to me that there’s a time limit for how much these issues matter. I can’t blame people, but it’s really disheartening to know that I have to take advantage of this time for people to care.”
Asian American student groups gathered Thursday night for a vigil in solidarity and remembrance of the victims of Tuesday’s shootings and all AAPI individuals who have suffered from anti-Asian hate crimes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A number of Harvard’s Asian and Asian American cultural groups held a virtual vigil Thursday night for victims of hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
More than 150 Harvard affiliates attended the gathering, intended to be a space for solidarity and remembrance. A Tuesday report from nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate documented 3,795 hate crimes against Asians from March 19, 2020 to February 28, 2021, and on Tuesday evening, a white gunman shot eight people at three Atlanta-area spas — six of whom were Asian women.
The rise in hate crimes has been largely attributed to anti-Asian rhetoric since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. In emails to the student body Thursday, Harvard administrators denounced the violence and called on Harvard affiliates to come together in support of AAPI students.
At the beginning of the vigil, organizers announced the formation of the Stop Asian Hate Coalition fundraiser, an effort by a number of student groups at Harvard to show solidarity and raise money for Asian American organizations in the Boston and Atlanta areas.
Raj K. S. Gambhir ’21, a member of the Sikh Students Association, said in opening the event that he and the other organizers hoped the vigil would act as a “healing space.”
“We hope that this can be a space where we can honor not only the lives that were lost, but the lives that have been affected by over the past few years and, frankly, centuries,” Gambhir said.
Gambhir said it was important for AAPI students to take care of their mental health during what has been “a tough year” for Asian Americans and other minorities. He and the organizers shared self-care resources with attendees.
After introductions, Harvard Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies organizer Ruth H. M. Jaensubhakij ’22 led one minute of silence for the victims of Tuesday’s shootings and other victims of AAPI hate crimes.
Following the moment of silence, the organizers created breakout rooms for students to gather and reflect in a more intimate setting.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, a member of Sikhs and Companions of Harvard, said following the event that the most important part of the vigil was “solidarity.”
“Seeing that support in so many ways was not just powerful, but a fuel for action for so many of us,” Ahuja said. “There is comfort in knowing that you’re seen and amplified in a time where it feels like you can be shouting so loud into what feels like a void.”
Ahuja added that the vigil was a “safe space” where she was able to learn about other people’s stories and how they were affected by these events. She concluded her reflection with a “loving and deeply profound request for action.”
“We need allies, we really do, whether it be sharing an Instagram post, whether it be educating your own family and community, or donating to the fundraiser,” Ahuja said. “That action matters.”

I know I’m not the only one with 50 shows on my Netflix list that I’ve been meaning to watch for the past 20 years, but haven’t been able to actually get around to watching. With classes, assignments, and other demanding ~responsibilities~, it’s difficult to devote enough time to our beloved TV shows. To save yourself from drowning in your growing watch list, we’ve got the tips you need for balancing school and your favorite series.
Multitask Mode
It’s time to put your multitasking skills to the test. Flop onto your couch, put on a show on your TV, and get to work on your assignments. This is something that I do religiously. (I am actually writing this piece while watching The Office, so I can certify that this method has been tried and tested). I find it easier to watch shows and do work that doesn’t involve too much reading, such as psets, so I wouldn’t recommend this for the humanities concentrators out there. If you can focus on both the words you’re hearing and the words you’re reading, though, then power to you.
Watch During Breaks
Those 15 minutes in between classes are there for a reason — for you to catch up on your favorite series! If you have three classes back-to-back, you can binge a whole 30 minutes of a show. That’s basically one episode! No effort is required for this — just have the Netflix tab ready to go as soon as you close the Zoom app. You don’t even need to leave your seat! We’re also not meant to be studying 24/7 (unless you’re a pre-med?), so use your study breaks to chill with your favorite characters. Even better, give yourself an incentive to study by rewarding yourself with an episode of a show after studying for a certain amount of time.
Use 2x Speed
If you want to be a little chaotic, watch your shows at 2x speed. You already do this for recorded lectures anyway, so why not bring it over to your entertainment? Let’s be honest, you’re probably used to keeping up with the fast talking by now. You’ll knock out way more episodes this way and cut down your show list in no time!
Watch During Class
For the risk-takers, split your screen and tune into your favorite Netflix show during class. If you’re going to watch something on your laptop for 75 minutes, you might as well make it entertaining. You might not want to hear the lovely sound of your professor and the characters on the show speaking at the same time, so you’ll probably have to mute the show (or mute the class? Your choice). Fortunately, you have subtitles so you can read and follow along with the plot while your professor’s voice provides some beautiful background music. Just be on guard if you get cold-called, though.
...Don’t Sleep
If none of these tips work for you, then you might as well get your priorities straight and just not sleep at all. Eight hours of Netflix >>> eight hours of sleep. I don’t make the rules. Instead of nourishing your body, nourish your mind with your favorite show quotes at 3 a.m.
Not to sound like your mom, but don’t let TV shows get in the way of your studies. Your subscription to Harvard Zoom University most likely costs way more than your Netflix subscription, so make sure you’re getting your money’s worth. Either way, it’s always great to throw on a good TV show to wind down and take a break from the stresses of school life.
