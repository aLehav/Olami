After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a (supposedly) well-established fact that women just aren’t funny. As a result, it’s tough being a woman in comedy. Take Amy Schumer, comedian du jour. A talented and unabashed stand up comic and sketch writer, it’s easy to see why everyone is talking about her all of a sudden.
In “Last F*ckable Day” she rips apart Hollywood’s sexist treatment of aging actresses. In “Milk Milk Lemonade” she parodies the booty craze. Her show Inside Amy Schumer is ruthless. She leaves no avenue unspared as she bashes stereotypes and gender roles and sexism and societal hypocrisies. And all the while, she is downright hilarious.
But look down at the comments section, and you might wonder if the commenters just watched the same video you did. Her sketch may be a satire of Bill Cosby fans, but all the commenters can see is her weight and the shapeliness of her legs.
Compare this to the comments that male comedians typically receive on their YouTube videos. Commenters on a Louis CK video usually gush over how funny he is and marvel at his talent. But commenters on an Amy Schumer video systematically criticize her weight, call her ugly, compare her to various unflattering animals—and then go on to admire her rear end and discuss the likelihood that he would sleep with her.
No discussion about how funny she is. No mention of her talent. Just comment after comment about her body.
And Schumer, perceptive as always, has already skewered this relentless objectification in her skit “Twelve Angry Men,” a parody of the classic movie—except this time the men are debating whether or not Schumer is “hot enough for TV.” And through this skit, a deeply depressing truth is revealed: No matter what she does, no matter how many jokes about her own vagina she makes, many people will never see Amy Schumer as funny.
And it’s not just Amy Schumer that they have trouble finding funny. It’s women in general. A 2012 study found that most people, men and women alike, tend to ascribe funnier cartoon captions to men rather than to women—even when they’ve already been told the writer was a woman. Simply put, it’s hard for people to see women as funny.
But what does it matter, right? As Christopher Hitchens once said, and as Amy Schumer video commenters often echo, maybe women aren’t funny because they’ve never needed to be funny. I mean, it’s just evolution. Throughout the years, as dinosaurs evolved into chickens and as carrier pigeons evolved into iPhones, human males evolved a sense of humor because it got them laid more often. One knock-knock joke, and before he knows it, the lucky man is a father to a litter of funny boys and unfunny girls. Or something like that. Science!
Sorry to burst your bubble, but while humor is a lot of things, it’s a lot more than just a flirting device used by men to woo women.
Sidenote: If “Damn girl, that dress looks good on you but it’d look even better on my bedroom floor” is what you consider humor, consider me unimpressed.
No, humor is far more powerful than that. Humor—particularly satire—is a tool of social commentary and criticism. It’s a way for people to hold up a mirror in front of society’s face and point out all the pockmarks.
Women, of all people, know that society is deeply flawed. When we routinely get paid less than our male colleagues, and when the length of our skirts determines whether or not we deserve to live—well, how could we not turn to humor to shine a light on society’s failings?
It sucks to acknowledge these truths, but it sucks even more to pretend they don’t exist. And one way of making it suck less is by using comedy to reveal how shitty life is sometimes. And that’s a huge part of the reason why Amy Schumer has been so successful, with sketches like “Girl, You Don’t Need No Makeup” making fun of unrealistic “natural beauty” expectations and sketches like “Hello M’Lady” satirizing those entitled guys convinced they’re in the “friendzone.” They get people to laugh, but they get them to start thinking, too.
So the question is not so much, “Can women be funny?” Humor, like most things in life, is subjective. Clearly I find Amy Schumer hilarious, but her style of humor is definitely not for all. The real question we should be asking is, “Why does that matter?” Why does it matter that most people find it so hard to believe that women can be funny?
It matters because humor is the voice, and oppression is the joke. And when you say “women aren’t funny,” you’re essentially silencing an entire population by telling them their voice isn’t important, and their oppression isn’t real.
Society’s inability to find women funny isn’t just an antiquated byproduct of traditional gender roles that compel women to be ladylike and encourage men to be more outspoken—it systematically strips women of a vital weapon for progress and change.
So I’d say it’s a pretty big deal that people still think women aren’t funny. It’s 2015, and we’ve already heard plenty of penis jokes—let the era of vagina jokes begin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MIT researchers recommended that the school divest its endowment from some fossil fuel companies—specifically, coal and tar sands—in a report released this week.
The committee was tasked by MIT administrators to “take the pulse” around MIT in regards to divestment and climate change, according to MIT professor and committee member Kerry Emanuel.
The report urged MIT’s central administration to divest from coal and tar sands specifically because they are “among the most carbon-intensive and environmentally hazardous fossil fuels,” and because this method of targeted, as opposed to blanket, divestment would pose less risk for losing “engagement opportunities with companies.”
The report comes as environmental activists at Harvard and elsewhere call for colleges and universities to divest from fossil fuel companies. In April, the activist group Divest Harvard staged a week-long protest, blocking entrances to buildings on campus and urging administrators to divest the University’s $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels.
The protest was unsuccessful; University President Drew G. Faust’s did not change her stance on divestment, which she has long argued is not “warranted or wise.” Harvard’s endowment, she wrote in a 2013 open letter, is “not an instrument to impel social or political change.”
According to University spokesperson Jeff Neal, Faust has not changed her stance on fossil fuel divestment since the MIT report’s release.
Still, while Harvard has opposed such a move, some peer schools have moved to divest from some fossil fuels in recent months. Last year, Stanford moved to divest from coal, and Georgetown recently followed suit.
Emanuel said Harvard should commission a similar task force, arguing that divestment is an issue “too important not to involve the community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews hoisted his third Stanley Cup in six years on Monday, putting the cap on a championship series that started with a goal by a Harvard man.
On June 3, Tampa Bay Lightning center and former Crimson men’s ice hockey standout Alex Killorn ’12 drew the first strike of the Finals on a crafty backhanded redirect with his back to the net. Despite his side’s decisive Game 6 loss 12 days later, the fourth-year pro has already established his place among Harvard hockey’s most successful alumni.
Here are a few notes on how Killorn’s postseason accomplishments stack up against the 26 other Crimson icemen who have seen playing time in the National Hockey League:
- His Game 1 score was the first goal scored by a Harvard alum in a Stanley Cup Final. Killorn added a second tally in Game 5 to become the first Crimson alum with multiple goals or assists in a final.
- His 2015 postseason scoring totals (9 goals, 9 assists, 18 points) are all single-postseason records among the 12 Harvard alumni who have played in the NHL postseason.
- Through five playoff series appearances over two postseasons, Killorn has 10 playoff goals, second only to veteran forward Dominic Moore ’03 (11 goals) on the Harvard all-time list. Killorn has played in only 30 playoff games to Moore’s 88.
- Killorn’s game-winning goal in Game 7 of the 2015 Eastern Conference Final marked the second consecutive year in which a Harvard alum scored the series-clinching goal of a conference final. In 2014, Moore scored the lone goal of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Final to send the New York Rangers to the league final. Since the NHL permanently moved to a conference championship playoff format for the 1981-1982 season, no two other players from the same collegiate or major junior program have scored conference championship-clinching goals in consecutive seasons.
- Killorn and Moore’s matchup in the Eastern Conference Final this year was the second meeting between former Harvard players in a conference final and the fourth in the playoffs overall. Don Sweeney ’88 defeated Neil Sheehy ’83 in 1990 when the Boston Bruins topped the Washington Capitals in the Wales Conference Final. Moore has faced Pittsburgh Penguins veteran Craig Adams ’99 in an Eastern Conference semifinals series twice—once as a member of the Montreal Canadiens (2010) and once as a member of the New York Rangers (2014).
- Killorn’s appearance in the Stanley Cup Final was the eighth by a Harvard alum, following that of George Owen ’28 (1929, 1930), Sweeney (1990), Adams (2006, 2008, 2009), and Moore (2014). Owen won the Cup as a rookie with the Boston Bruins in 1929, while Adams has won twice—once with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006 and once with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009.
Adding to his list of accomplishments, Killorn also earned a Harvard shout-out on a Tampa church’s bulletin board and a USA Today blog post on his incredible playoff mustache.

Ah, summer. Freedom at last. Now that you’re not tied down to the monotony of term time life, it’s time to finally enjoy yourself. Whether you’re spending it away from home trying to make some money, pad your resume, or rekindle old flames in your hometown, this summer is going to be the best one yet, right?
Wrong—so wrong. To help you all come to terms with your inevitable fate for the next few months, we’ve compiled a list of what’s coming your way.
The Unpaid Internship
Expectation: You remind yourself how fortunate you are to have landed this internship at a campaign/not-for-profit/charity. This is going to be so rewarding, you tell yourself. It doesn’t matter that you’re not getting paid because it’s going to be that good. You picture yourself giving back to the community and making real change in the public sector.
Reality: You spend every single day of the summer cursing the fools down at OCS for not giving you more funding. Living in a broom closet and consuming only free office food and 99 cent bags of chips all summer is far from ideal.
The Paid Internship
Expectation: Racks on racks on racks! Not only are you going to gain valuable work experience, but you’ll come out of it with money in the bank.
Reality: Between housing, food, transportation, and everything else you’ve been spending your precious money on this summer, you’ll barely have enough money to buy plane tickets back to Cambridge by August.
The Job Back Home
Expectation: This will be the high school summer you never had. You picture yourself reminiscing of old times with your high school buds and hitting up your favorite hometown party spots. Plus, you’ll be making money while enjoying the cozy bed and home cooking that you missed oh-so much.
Reality: You will get coffee with a high school friend once. Then you will resort to spending half of your free time with your family and half of your free time alone hate-watching season 4 of “Scandal” in your parents’ basement. (Speaking of parents, they will cook delicious hot food for you for a week, and then they will realize that you are, in fact, a fully-functioning adult who can cook yourself. After this realization, you will be eating microwave popcorn.)
The ‘Just Chilling’
Expectation: Working is so overrated. This summer, you’re going to work on your physical and mental well-being and come back to campus feeling better than anyone. You picture yourself running, doing yoga, eating healthy, regularly updating your Pinterest, and finally starting that blog you’ve wanted. It totally doesn’t matter that you have three months of unstructured free time.
