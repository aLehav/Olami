After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rick Guidotti worked at the top of the fashion industry with companies like Elle, Marie Claire, and L’Oreal; worked out of a studio in New York City; and traveled to places like Italy for shoots. Then he gave all that up. What could prompt such a decision?
“I was just always told who was beautiful, told this is the standard of beauty, this is the model of the moment, and that’s who I had to photograph, or someone who looked like that… But you know, I’m an artist. I see beauty in every moment. I don’t just see beauty in someone’s idea,” he says.
Guidotti’s photographs were on display last Thursday and Friday in the Science Center lobby as part of an event entitled “Prejudice and Violence Against Albinos: An International Concern.” The event, organized by The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, also featured a panel discussion moderated by Dr. S. Allen Counter and featuring Guidotti.
In 1997, Guidotti co-founded Positive Exposure, an innovative arts organization that works with individuals living with genetic differences. Guidotti was inspired to found this organization after he spotted a child with albinism waiting for the bus outside his studio in New York. He was disturbed that though this child was beautiful, she did not meet conventional standards of beauty. “When I went to research,” he says, “I saw horrible photographs. Instead of finding photos of this beautiful kid and people like her, I found horrible images of people in circuses, or kids in doctors’ offices up against a blank wall without their clothes on with a bar against their eyes, of images of kids with red eyes.” The misrepresentation of people with albinism stirred Guidotti’s will to act.
He approached NOAH (National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation), a support group for people with albinism, with a proposal for a series of photographs showing the world what he calls “the beauty of albinism.” To his surprise, NOAH rejected the idea. “I asked why, and they explained to me about their fears of exploitation,” he says. “[They explained] how every time there’s a magazine article about a kid with albinism, it’s about a victim. It’s always a negative depiction. And I thought, ‘That’s insane, we need to fix this.’ So I said, ‘Let’s partner, let’s work together, and you can make sure I don’t exploit these people with albinism.’”
Through cross-sector partnerships with governmental agencies, health advocacy organizations, and educational institutions, Positive Exposure uses the visual arts to empower people with genetic differences. Positive Exposure uses art to effect change in fields like human rights, genetics, and mental health.
Working with Positive Exposure, Guidotti has viewed all regions of the world through his camera lenses. “We’re not working only with kids with albinism, we’re also working with many other genetic conditions as well. It’s about all differences, because there is such universal applicability here. It’s about embracing, celebrating our differences. It’s a message that we all have to hear, that should be in every curriculum, every language.”
Guidotti believes there is an important correlation between art and spreading powerful messages to others. He says, “As an artist, people look away or stare. My responsibility is to steady your gaze long enough. You know, don’t look away, and then you’ll see beauty in the differences... I challenge stigma, address issues of stigma and discrimination, and celebrate diversity utilizing the visual arts.”
Following the exhibit at the Science Center, Guidotti hopes that his work will prove meaningful to the Harvard community. “Ideally, what I’d like to do…is to inspire the heart of this community to utilize whatever tools they have, to utilize any of their own passions to address these issues, whether it’s through journalism, music, sculpture, painting, photography—to utilize their passions whatever they may be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday night, voters in California turned down Proposition 19, a ballot measure that would have made California the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Despite the failure of the proposal, we believe that government at the state and federal levels should continue to push for the legalization of marijuana.
First of all, the health risk posed by the consumption of marijuana is not sufficient for the prohibition of the drug. Various scientific studies have shown alcohol and cigarette consumption to be more dangerous than smoking marijuana. Not only is marijuana not as addictive as tobacco, studies have shown tobacco to be a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer, and other diseases related to the heart and lung, while no such correlation is confirmed for marijuana. Similarly, while overconsumption of alcohol is known to cause death, scientists have not been able to pinpoint marijuana overdose as a cause of death. It does not make sense for the government to punish people for using a drug while allowing for the consumption of other substances that are more harmful and addictive.
Granted, smoking marijuana is not entirely benign, but the notion that any activity harmful to the individual pursuing it should be made illegal is faulty. To an extent, our country should allow people the freedom to decide whether they want to engage in activities that are marginally harmful to their health and to determine for themselves, to some degree, the line between marginally harmful and significantly harmful. That is not to say that the use of marijuana should be unregulated. In order to protect minors and the general public, we propose that legalized marijuana consumption should come with an age restriction of 18 or older, and that driving under the influence should be illegal, akin to driving under the influence of alcohol.
Legalization of marijuana is imperative not only because the drug is no more dangerous than alcohol and cigarettes, but also because of the benefits legalization renders. Currently, in the failing economy, law enforcement cracking down on marijuana consumption is a wasteful use of resources when the money can be invested in more pressing matters. There is also potential tax revenue to be gained from legalizing marijuana; according to the California State Board of Equalization, the tax revenue from marijuana sales can reach as much as $1.4 billion dollars a year. Moreover, legalizing domestic marijuana would only reduce the dependence on foreign drug cartels, hopefully helping to mitigate the drug-related violence in Latin American countries.
Despite our support for Proposition 19, we believe that legalization of marijuana should take place at the federal level. Even if the measure had passed, recreational use of marijuana would still be illegal at the federal level under Congress’s Controlled Substances Act, which could have led to legal dispute between the state and federal authorities. If legalization occurs only at the state level, a change in administration could, for example, lead to more aggressive enforcement of federal marijuana laws, leading to a clash in jurisdictions.
Marijuana consumption should not be prohibited merely because of the traditional, misinformed categorization of it within the same group as highly dangerous drugs. Despite Proposition 19’s failure, we hope that the federal government takes action on the issue as soon as possible.
CORRECTION: November 8, 2010 
 
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of the Nov. 5 editorial "Legalize It" stated that the tax revenue from marijuana sales could reach as much as $1.4 million dollars a year. In fact, the tax revenue from marijuana sales could reach as much as $1.4 billion dollars a year. The Crimson regrets the error.

When many students reflect on why they are at Harvard, they will (or should) probably give their parents some credit for raising them well. The most important thing that our parents did for us was uphold very high expectations. Our economy is not so different from a student at times–its success depends on well-calibrated expectations, and often it is not operating at full potential because of low expectations. People don’t expect customers to buy their goods or major investments to have a high return, so they don’t hire new employees, and the economy is mired in a low-growth track. The Federal Reserve can change these expectations and have a profound impact on economic growth, and though they’ve finally started trying to do so, there is much more that they can do.
The Federal Reserve holds the keys to changing these expectations through monetary stimulus, and on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve finally announced its long-awaited expansionary program, “Quantitative Easing 2,” which it hopes will boost the lagging economy. The plan is long overdue and completely necessary, and must be followed by far bolder action by the Federal Reserve.
Normally, when the Federal Reserve wants to strengthen the economy, they lower short-term interest rates, an action that incentivizes corporations to spend. This can’t be done now, however, because interest rates have already been lowered to zero percent for quite some time. Thus, in “quantitative easing,” the Federal Reserve will buy $600 billion of Treasury bonds through open market operations, thus releasing a new batch of fresh cash into the economy.
QE2 should have a number of positive effects on the economy. The influx of cash into the economy should decrease long-term interest rates, which still have room to fall. This decrease will make long-term investment and borrowing more affordable. Inflation will also rise, which should encourage businesses to let go of their hoards of cash and invest in job creation. The dollar will weaken in relation to other currencies, which will strengthen American exports.
The Fed’s program will start to affect the economy in these ways—but there is much more that it must do. The Fed weakly acknowledges that inflation is not high enough, but this statement won’t do much to change expectations. If they instead explicitly said they would keep easing until inflation reached a target of four percent (the rate during Ronald Reagan’s presidency), it would do a great deal to get businesses spending again. A much larger set of bond purchases would also create significantly better outcomes, because as Paul R. Krugman noted, “$600 billion really isn’t a lot when you’re trying to move a $15 trillion economy.”
Many naysayers inexplicably argue that this could create runaway inflation. Such concerns are absurd when inflation has been far too low for years, and our country was growing just fine in the mid-to-late 1980’s, when inflation was around four percent. Others worry that QE2 might lead to bubbles in emerging markets such as China. China has a solution to that problem that the world might quite like: They can let the yuan appreciate. Finally, concerns about “currency wars,” in which everyone attempts to ease their currency, are completely misguided. “Competitive reflation” might actually be a boon to the global economy by providing stimulus the world over, as it did during the Great Depression.
The Federal Reserve is on the right path, but much more bold action is needed, because unless there is a truly massive change in expectations, the economy will continue to grow far below its potential.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was Friday night, and I was bored. Epically, epochally, brain-numbingly bored. The semester had arrived at its predictable post-midterm lull—that moment where Mondays begin to bleed into Tuesdays and seep back into Sunday evenings. The week had passed without incident, marked by unmemorable meals and abortive afternoon naps: a tiresome blah blah blah of classes, caffeine, and computer screens. Nothing had happened, so to speak—and now that the weekend had come, that was what I desperately needed: something, anything, not beholden to tedious routine.
Boredom at Harvard comes in several varieties, ranging from the relatively benign to the intensely anxious. There is weekend-night boredom, fueled by Harvard’s oft—and, of late, much maligned—lack of enticing social options. This generally devolves into a late-night common-room-futon situation, involving several people sandwiched on a Pabst Blue Ribbon-scented surface, or ends early with resignation to Hulu. Next comes weekday-night boredom, inspired by a concatenation of too much work, too little will, and an absence of outlets for procrastination. These are the times one ventures to Lamont only to leave two-hours later, tepid beverage and scattered sentences of tomorrow’s assignment in tow. Freshman-fall boredom hits first and hardest: the consequence of vast swaths of unstructured time and few structured activities with which to fill it. Initial overzealous commitment yields to desubscribed Listservs and dropped comps—around the same time that free food stops accompanying every meeting.
Thanks to the Internet, and the advent of anonymous comment threads, the vagaries of boredom at Harvard have congealed into a veritable archive. Bored at Lamont began the litany in November 2007; five months later, it had amassed an incredible 170,000 posts. Now distinctly démodé, in its heyday, the site boasted an unrivaled ability to channel undergraduate angst—which veered, oddly enough, toward the kinky. A catalog of sexual privation on campus, Bored at Lamont inspired an outpouring of commentary–sometimes sardonic, but often desperate—on sex at Harvard, and the lack thereof. Contemporary incarnations, such as Harvard FML and I Saw You Harvard, provide less salacious (read: moderated) venues for listless students to meditate on unsated lust, generally in the form of an impossible crush or happenstance dining hall encounter. Boredom and its bedfellow, procrastination, again arc toward libidinal frustration and fantasizing.
This emotional amalgam—boredom, a penchant for putting-off, and a preoccupation with sex—seems to sum not only much of the Harvard undergraduate experience, but modern existence writ large. That the latter two attend modernity borders on truism, as five minutes spent online—that most modern of phenomena—readily proves. Facebook and YouTube (procrastination tools par excellence) are among the web’s top-three most visited sites, while porn constitutes 37 percent of all Internet content, according to a recent report.  If porn is considered a niche form of procrastination, it’s no wonder that the latter is on the rise: According to Piers Steel, a professor at the University of Calgary, the percentage of people who professed to perpetually putting things off quadrupled between 1978 and 2002.
Boredom proves more difficult to parse. Derived from the Biblical acedia and the French ennui, the term appeared in the latter half of the 19th century to connote an abiding, all-over malaise. Its debut coincided with the Industrial Revolution: a technological effervescence that supplanted natural temporal rhythms with mechanized, clock-based time. Displaced from nature and the self to the automated object, time emptied of content. Distinct from work, leisure was something to be “filled” in advance, lest boredom—an unsettling encounter with time as vacant and void—ensue. The endless, discrete tickings of the clock became a sort of synecdochal tag for the unbearable homogeneity of modern existence.
This, admittedly, is a bleak picture. Boredom, however, is a bleak emotion—one that our constant-entertainment culture seems explicitly engineered to avoid. If being bored means not being interested, and being interested means simply not being bored, this ready reversibility raises a troubling existential question: is anything really worth doing, or is it all just an elaborate distraction designed to keep boredom at bay?
Friday nights at Harvard probably won’t get more exciting any time soon, UC Task Forces and anti-Final Club Campaigns notwithstanding. What, then, is the solution to being Bored at Harvard? Four Loko study breaks? January term programming? Orgies in Lamont of the actual, rather than merely digital, variety? Snarkiness aside, perhaps Harvard students simply need to endure the occasional eventless evening as part and parcel of life under the Crimson. If boredom is, after all, a symptom of modernity, we might as well accept that being bored is here to stay.

This summer, Robert Freeman was shot dead in his neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. He was 13 years old and riding his bike at the time. Sources say that after shooting him off of his bicycle, the masked gunman proceeded to stand over his wounded body and fire round after round—22 in total. Tragic stories like Freeman’s are too common these days in my hometown.
If one wants more proof of Chicago’s descent into gun-related horror, the evidence is too easy to find. In one 24-hour period in late May, there were 22 shooting victims—all separate incidences. Over the weekend of June 18, more than 40 Chicagoans were victims of gun violence. I could easily go on. At one point, state lawmakers in Springfield seriously considered dispatching the Illinois National Guard to bring gun violence under control in the city. One representative, LaShawn Ford, reflecting the desperation and heartbreak that has characterized the summer, stated, “If they can save even one life, one child, in my community, I would welcome the National Guard with open arms and I am confident that my constituents would as well.” Even Illinois Senator Dick Durbin has appealed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to help combat the city’s intense gang problem, which is seen to be a major cause of recent rises in gun violence.
But while Chicago (and most other major US cities) burned, the big national gun news of the summer was the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonald v. Chicago to strike down the city’s handgun ban and declare that Second Amendment protections extended to state and city levels as well as the federal level.It was a big win for the National Rifle Assocation—not so much for American cities.
Opponents of gun regulation point to the rise of gun-related deaths in Chicago despite the handgun ban as evidence that gun control does not work. I reject this argument because the alternative is to accept that Americans are inherently a crueler and more violent people, many times over, than any other on the planet, the logical conclusion of the glib “guns don’t kill people, people kill people” defense. Britain, Germany, and Spain, all of which have very strict gun-control laws suffered a total of 293 gun murders in 2006. The United States had 9,484.
We need to get serious about smart and effective gun-control legislation. Obvious starts such as closing the “Gun Show Loophole,” which allows the sale of guns at gun shows without background checks or record-keeping, must be coupled with more funding for cities and states to enforce controls already in effect. Such measures do not mean the end of guns in America as NRA doomsayers would have people think. Most guns should remain available upon a thorough background check and waiting period. However, the notion that anyone has a use for a military-style rifle for recreational purposes is absurd, and those who defend their sale on the floor of Congress do this country a grave disservice.
Gang problems are equally culpable and need to be addressed as well in order to stem the rising tide of gun violence. More police with better, and more community-friendly, tactics are needed. Community outreach, whether through the church, through city government, or through other local programs, is also an essential element to reducing gang-perpetrated gun violence. Boston has led the way with such community initiatives as the “Ten Point Coalition” and “Operation Ceasefire.” Similar programs have produced stunning results in violence-reduction and often only fail for want of funding. The Obama administration has been much more amenable to such approaches than its predecessor, but there is still more to do.
To be frank, I am sick and tired of reading in the Chicago Tribune each morning about another teenager mowed down by an automatic weapon, another child killed in a drive-by shooting, or another parent or grandparent slain as bystanders. The time to act is now. Lawmakers need to stop cowering before the NRA, do their job, and protect the American people. And if that means more spending on police operations, community and gang outreach initiatives, and gun-control enforcement, so be it. Call me a big-spending liberal, but just try to explain to Freeman’s mother why saving a few tax dollars was more important than potentially saving her son’s life.

CORRECTION: November 8, 2010
An earlier version of the Nov. 5 op-ed "Living At Gunpoint" referred to "semi-automatic machine guns" and implied that they are legal to purchase in the United States. In fact, the term semi-automatic machine gun is  incorrect; semi-automatic rifles are legal to purchase. Additionally, the writer intended to state that the sale of military-style rifles is defended in Congress, not assault weapons. The Crimson  regrets the errors.

To the editors:
I have the distinct privilege to be a part of a blocking group that is comprised of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim members. Dinner conversations are remarkable, and although we believe we have different paths to salvation, we all love to make other people smile.
All of these friends are compassionate individuals and some of the most phenomenal human beings I have ever encountered in my life. Given my experience, I feel compelled to write this letter in response to Avishai D. Don's Oct. 21 column, "God Soup".
While I find it commendable that this young man endeavors to prove his faith the most compassionate, I find many faults with his argument. In particular, in an attempt to prove his point, Don puts forth a radically weak and untrue argument that is a cheap attack on the Islamic faith.
To base the claim that Islam is not compassionate on the acts of a few individuals is to claim that Judaism and Christianity have been pure throughout the centuries without any misguided followers.
As a Christian, I am quick to acknowledge the Christian terrorist sects of the Klu Klux Klan that have strayed extraordinarily far from fundamental Christian principles. Does this make the teachings of Jesus null and void? Of course not, because people can be religious only in name and not by practice.
Is Judaism not a compassionate religion because Jewish terrorists assassinated Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden, a nobleman noted for his negotiation of the release of about 31,000 prisoners from German concentration camps during World War II as he sought to bring peace to the Middle East? Of course not. I know a preponderance of Jewish people who would never hurt a fly.
So while Mr. Don goes on discrediting the Muslim faith, I will strive to be half the man that my Muslim friend is—at the time of writing, I am enjoying a night off while he is tutoring immigrants to pass their United States citizenship test.
Let us stop illogical generalizations in a place that cherishes "veritas."

To the editors:
We are writing to correct an error in an otherwise very positive and illuminating article about the Visiting Undergraduate Student program by Julie M. Zauzmer (“Visiting Harvard,” Oct. 27, 2010).  In the final section of the article the reporter wrote, "Despite their immersion in most academic and extracurricular facets of Harvard, VUS are not included in one important area of undergraduate life: the House system."  Although the article is referring to the fact that VUS are not able to live on campus due to overcrowding, it creates a misconception that the visiting students are without the advising structure, support, and programming that the House system provides.  In fact, for the past three years the visiting students have been affiliated with Dudley House, and they have been an important part of the Dudley undergraduate community (which also includes Dudley Co-operative Society members and off-campus students who are affiliated with Dudley).
As members of the Dudley undergraduate community, VUS have House advisers who are part of the tutorial staff.  The visiting students also have the support of the Coordinator of Visiting Student Advising (a Dudley tutor), the Undergraduate Coordinator for Dudley, the Resident Dean, and the Masters of Dudley House.  As a House we organize social gatherings just for the visiting students, and we plan events to which all of our undergraduates are invited.  The visiting students have also participated actively in the wide variety of programming orchestrated by the Dudley House Fellows for the Dudley graduate and undergraduate constituencies. (We encourage readers to visit our website http://dudley.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do to see the wealth of activities organized through Dudley House.)  Two of the visiting students are members of the Dudley House Student Committee, which is another way in which visiting students can participate in and have a voice in House life.
The visiting students are a vibrant, enthusiastic group of students, and we are very pleased that they are affiliated with Dudley House.  We are happy to be able to provide this engaged and talented group of students with a house community, and we are continually seeking additional mechanisms to help them feel more connected with their peers at Harvard.

The language used to conduct psychological tests might need be reexamined, Harvard researchers say.
The findings, published in the latest issue of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, revealed a significant difference in answers from the same test conducted in different languages for bilingual speakers.
Co-authored by Harvard African and African American Studies teaching fellow Oludamini D. Ogunnaike ’07, the study was based on Implicit Association Tests, which were developed as a way to determine people’s natural responses and inclination to associate an idea such as a race or religion with a positively or negatively charged adjective.
“If you ask someone ‘are you prejudiced,’ most people are going to say no. But most people do have prejudices and preferences,” Ogunnaike said.
Ogunnaike worked with Harvard pscyhology and social ethics professor Mahzarin R. Banaji to study Moroccan bilingual respondents who categorized names as either French or Arabic. They then had to repeat the experiment with the association of French as “bad” and Arabic as “good,” and vice-versa.
Ogunnaike said when the test was given in Arabic, respondents tended to more quickly associate “good” with Arabic names; in French, the results were the opposite.
He also conducted this experiment in the United States with Spanish-speaking Americans and found the same outcome: that results differed based on the language of the test.
The idea for this research stemmed from Ogunnaike’s senior thesis for a joint concentration in African Studies and Cognitive Neuroscience, for which Ogunnaike administered the IAT test in French to Senegalese respondents, but decided to change the language to the participants’ native Wolof.
“I began to wonder what would happen,” Ogunnaike said, “if the results we would get would be different if we put the test in a different language.”
Ogunnaike, who also speaks French, Yoruba, and Arabic, said he hopes his test will change the methods other researchers use to conduct surveys internationally.
“For the world of cognitive science,” he said, “[the study] means we have to be very careful about the languages that we operate in. It’s not enough just to limit tests to European languages that most researchers are familiar with. You can get completely different results.”
Ogunnaike added though the test was conducted with bilinguals, it might also apply to multilinguals, and he would like to look further at whether results would differ in languages that respondents learned after childhood.
“That would be an interesting avenue for future research,” he said.

Scientists at Harvard and the University of California, San Diego, have provided evidence for the first time of a gene that plays a role in shaping an individual’s political beliefs.
The study, published last week in the October issue of The Journal of Politics, analyzed data from over 2500 adolescents and found that a specific variation in a dopamine receptor gene normally associated with novelty-seeking can lead to more liberal political ideologies in an individual.
However, the variation in the gene known as DRD4 only displayed an association with political liberalism if the subjects had an active social life while growing up, according to the study.
The principal author of the study and Professor of Medical Genetics and Political Science at UC San Diego, James H. Fowler ’92, explained novelty-seeking can lead to highly individualistic behavior.
“If you also have an active social life, with people with different lifestyles and world views, you are much more likely to develop liberal views,” he added.
Fowler emphasized that the results of the study show a combination between one’s environment and one’s genes determines political ideology, not simply one or the other.
“We studied the gene because we have already been studying the environment ad nauseam,” Fowler said, citing a multitude of studies linking political leanings to ethnicity, race, education, and socioeconomic status. “This way of thinking assumes we are all blank slates, and that’s just not true.”
Fowler and his team members first drew on psychological studies indicating that among the five domains of personality—openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and stability—liberals tend to score high on openness. Because the methods used to measure openness on these tests were similar to those used to measure novelty-seeking, the researchers decided to focus on the DRD4 gene, Fowler said.
Fowler, who has also done extensive work on social networks, emphasized that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in the field of genopolitics.
“We are only explaining one half of one percent of the variation in political ideology,” he said. “This is not the only gene that matters.”
Researchers now, including assistant professor of political science Peter Hatemi at the University of Iowa, are trying to create an entire genome map for political ideology.
One of the co-authors of the recent study is Pforzheimer House Master and Harvard Medical School professor Nicholas A. Christakis. He and Fowler are co-authors of the book “Connected: The Surprising Power of our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives.”
The other authors of the study are Jaime E. Settle and Christopher T. Dawes from University of California, San Diego.

Three tickets will vie for the top leadership of the Undergraduate Council for the 2011 calendar year, according to an e-mail sent by the UC Election Commission yesterday.
The official announcement confirmed the predictions of UC insiders last week that Social Life Task Force Chair Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12 and Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12 are gunning for the top post of the Council.
The two have chosen Education Committee Chair Tengbo Li ’12 and Secretary Bonnie Cao ’12, respectively, as their vice presidential candidates.
Outsider candidate Collin A. Jones ’12 and running mate Peter D. Davis ’12 will be rounding out the playing field, according to the e-mail.
Similar to last year’s race, two slates come from within the Council. But according to UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11, this year’s election will mark the first time in recent memory that all the insider candidates are current UC leaders.
Hysen said such experience may push both tickets to be realistic about their campaign promises—but students may have a difficult time distinguishing between two tickets backed by comparable degrees of UC knowledge.
“Last year one of the big things that [UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11] and I had campaigned on was that we had already had experience. This year both tickets can make that claim,” Hysen said. “They have to convince voters, ‘I’ve been running a committee and I’ve been doing it better than the other ticket.’”
On the other hand, Jones and Davis come to the race without any experience on the Council. Jones, a Comparative Study of Religion concentrator in Quincy House, was a runner-up in The Crimson’s “Chickwich Challenge” this fall. His running mate, Davis, a Government concentrator in Currier House, is a correspondent for On Harvard Time.
Hysen said he is interested to see what Jones and Davis bring to the table, adding that last year’s “nontraditional” ticket—led by Hysen’s former roommate Robert G.B. Long ’11—“set a very high bar.”
Hysen predicted all three tickets will focus on campus social life as the main issue of the campaign.
“That’s the thing that’s getting student groups excited,” Hysen said. “Whatever ticket is better able to express ideas to improve social life at Harvard, I think that’s the ticket that you’re going to see win.”
UC election rules allow the candidates to begin campaigning at 12:01 a.m. on Monday.

Former New York Times reporter Linda J. Greenhouse ’68 and Yale Law professor Reva Siegel narrated the story of abortion from the period before the landmark Supreme Court case, granting women the right to an abortion, to the present day yesterday evening in the Radcliffe Gymnasium.
The lecture, hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, was delivered before more than 150 people and explored the roots of the abortion reform movement and the origins of medical, legal, and feminist pressure that changed state laws and informed the Supreme Court’s decision.
“Americans asked today to name any Supreme Court decision they can think of are eight times more likely to come up with Roe against Wade than Brown against Board of Education,” said Greenhouse, who covered the U.S. Supreme Court for the Times for 30 years. “Why? It comes to mind because over the past 37 years Roe versus Wade has become synonymous with political controversy and has generated profound social conflict.”
Greenhouse and Siegel invited the audience to consider institutional motivations for the polarization post-Roe v. Wade, aside from waving an accusatory finger at the courts.
“There is a different institutional motivation for conflict after Roe v. Wade that has nothing to do with courts on which polarization is typically blamed. The Catholic church, Republican party and women’s movement have much to do with our story,” Greenhouse said. ”We do not have all the answers, but we hope to inspire humanity, scholars, and social scientists to pursue avenues of research to give us greater understanding of American political life.”
Siegel noted that in August of 1972, the Gallup poll reported that 64 percent of all groups believed “a decision to have an abortion should solely be made between a woman and her physician.” More Republicans than Democrats held this view: 68 percent of republicans supported the statement, while only 59 percent of democrats did, Siegel added.
“Abortion became an issue of conflict and polarization, and it was said that Roe v. Wade ‘polarized our politics,’ adopting a court-centered understanding of the abortion conflict,” Siegel said. “However, there was a striking switch in party identification. How does court-centered narrative explain this?”
Sarah E. Esty ’11, who is now working with Siegel on her thesis to answer this question, said the discussion was unique in that the “historical narrative so ingrained in American political culture seems to be only a small part of a larger story.”
“This [lecture] was a superb effort to look before the Supreme Court decision which encourages us to step back from our assumptions about the Supreme Court role in abortion politics,” said Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow. “These issues are tied in today, and I wish more young women would have come.”

Obesity spreads much like infectious diseases, particularly with respect to individuals’ social networks, Harvard researchers say.
According to the classic influenza model, interacting with more sick people increases the likelihood of catching the virus, but the number of healthy people present doesn’t affect recovery chances.
“We were interested in applying this traditional infectious diseases framework to look at social contagiousness of obesity,” said Alison L. Hill, the lead author and a graduate student in Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and the Biophysics Program. “Does obesity follow the same dynamics as the flu?”
The study—published yesterday in the journal PLoS Computational Biology—found having more interactions with obese people indeed increases one’s risks of becoming obese. However, having non-obese people around does not make weight loss any easier.
Analyzing data collected over 40 years from the Framingham Heart Study, the researchers evaluated individuals’ risks of gaining or losing weight, then factored in the impact of their social network, which included parents, children, spouses, close friends, and co-workers.
From this data, they estimated that a non-obese individual has a two percent risk of becoming obese each year, and this figure increases on average 0.4 percent with each obese social contact.
Hill said she and her fellow researchers were surprised to see that the contagiousness of obesity has also risen over the years.
The Centers of Disease Control estimated that one third of Americans are currently obese, with another third overweight but not obese, making obesity a serious health concern for Americans. This study predicts that the obesity level may grow beyond 42 percent if it continues to become more infectious, a claim which contradicts some recent projections that the obesity epidemic has reached a peak, Hill said.
“Traditional approaches to studying obesity don’t take into account social factors,” said David G. Rand, co-author and a research scientist in the Harvard Program for Evolutionary Dynamics.
“Our results have serious implications for policy-makers. [They] raise important sociological questions: what’s causing this phenomenon? How can we prevent obesity from becoming more contagious over time?” he said.
Though the Framingham Heart Study only tracks people over the age of 30, Hill hypothesized that the results would be applicable to young adults and children as well, particularly since they are thought to be more easily influenced by peers.
Nicholas A. Christakis, the senior researcher of the paper and Harvard Medical School professor, did not respond to requests for comment.

Arguing that increased literacy leads to higher GDPs and life expectancy rates, John J. Wood praised the work of his award-winning non-profit Room to Read, which builds schools and libraries in the developing world, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education yesterday.
Four million children have benefited from Room to Read’s endeavors, which have included building more than 1,000 schools and 10,000 libraries, Wood said at yesterday’s speech.
He said the non-profit aims to expand into Tanzania and other countries while reaching out to 10 million children by 2020—an aggressive growth rate he compared to that of Starbucks.
“If the world needs a new latte, the world damn well needs literacy,” Wood said.
Wood was both humorous and heartfelt while discussing Room to Read, citing benefits of literacy beyond simply being able to read. Educated women, for example, are twice as likely to vaccinate their children, according to Wood.
“Education has a ripple effect,” Wood said.
This talk was part of the Graduate School of Education’s Askwith Forum series, which brings leaders to discuss current topics in education. The audience at yesterday’s talk came from Harvard, MIT, and the Greater Boston area.
Room to Read currently operates in 10 countries throughout Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, it works with local communities to build schools and libraries for children. It also publishes native-language children’s books and provides scholarships for girls to graduate from secondary school.
After discussing Room to Read and its plans to expand, Wood answered questions on topics ranging from illiteracy in America and corporate sponsorships in Japan to projects being run by students.
For instance, in response to a question from Linfeng Yang ’11 about distributing e-readers in the developing world, Wood said that such a plan would not be cost-efficient.
Office of Career Services Assistant Director Loredana George, who attended the event, said she “loved the talk.”
After first hearing about the organization through a friend, she said she found Wood and the organization exciting and interesting.
“I think I’m going to get involved,” she said, especially since Room to Read is involved in her native country.

The use of a patient-tailored fall prevention program has reduced the number of older patients who experience falls in hospitals, according to a study conducted by Harvard Medical School instructor Patricia C. Dykes.
Dykes and her colleagues developed a “fall prevention tool kit” that includes a fall risk assessment, patient-specific prevention plan, educational handouts for patients, and posters hung over patients’ beds that detail why they are at risk of falling.
At four urban U.S. hospitals, the researchers compared the fall rates of units that used the usual fall prevention program and those that implemented the tool kit.
The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that 67 out of 5,160 patients in units using the tool kit had falls—compared to the 87 out of 5,104 in the control units.
Hospitalized patients are at a higher risk of falling due to the unfamiliar environment, the effects of medication, and their states of health. Falling not only has physical consequences—such as fractures, head injuries, and even death—but is also costly for patients, their families, and the health care system, according to Dykes, who also works for Partners HealthCare.
The elderly population is particularly at risk of falling: one in every three adults who are 65 and older falls each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Morse fall scale is currently used in acute care settings to assess a patient’s likelihood of falling. If the scale concludes that a patient is at high risk, a “High Risk for Fall” sign is posted by the individual’s bed—without providing information on why the patient is at risk and the kinds of behavior that should be avoided.
But Dykes’ project rethinks this approach: “Instead of having a blanket of intervention across all patients, we looked at what places a patient at risk individually,” she said.
Dykes said she hopes hospitals will implement the fall prevention tool kit, or at least recognize that the plan of care currently in place to prevent falls should be tailored to fit a patient’s specific risks.
Further research is needed to determine if the tool kit can reduce repeated falls over time and to develop a set of interventions to prevent fall-related injuries.

Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences graduate students swept top honors at the Collegiate Inventors Competition in Washington D.C. last week.
This year was the first in recent history Harvard took the top three places at the competition, which aims to foster innovation by recognizing young scientists and inventors.
First prize winner Alice A. Chen, a doctoral student at SEAS and member of the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology Program, won $15,000 for her work on engineering human liver implants in mice.
Chen’s invention is a specialized cell matrix, which includes functional human liver cells along with the nutrients needed for the cells to grown, and may enable scientists to generate functioning human livers in mice.
The benefits of this innovation include providing medical researchers with improved mouse models for drug testing.
Postdoctoral researcher Erez Lieberman-Aiden took second place and $10,000 for developing Hi-C, a technology which helps scientists understand how genomic DNA folds in the nucleus of a cell.The technique, which has already attracted attention in the field of genomics, may also benefit researchers studying genome-related diseases like cancer.
Former SEAS graduate student Bozhi Tian, now a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, and SEAS graduate student Itzhaq T. Cohen-Karni were awarded $5,000 and third prize for their work on electronic cell probes.
Tian and Cohen-Karni developed an intracellular probe using three-dimensional silicon nanowires that, when inserted into a cell, act as field-effect transistors, which monitor electrical signals in the cell to show how fundamental cellular processes occur.
Since its inception in 1990, the competition has awarded over $1 million to winning finalists through partnerships with government, industry, and academic organizations.
Harvard graduate students took top prize in 2008 and 2009.
Area Dean for Applied Mathematics Michael P. Brenner noted the competition’s results reflects Harvard’s efforts to expand interdisciplinary collaboration between the pure and applied sciences.
“There are a lot of inventive graduate students in SEAS and I am glad to see their efforts be recognized,” Brenner said.

Former ambassador of Afghanistan Said Tayeb Jawad has been named the inaugural Fisher Family Fellow to the Future of Diplomacy Project at Harvard Kennedy School, officials announced earlier this week.
The fellowship for the Future of Diplomacy Project—headed by Kennedy School professor R. Nicholas Burns with a launch date of Nov. 15—will bring practitioners involved with international policy to Harvard to increase international affairs teaching on campus.
During his one month residency, Jawad will participate in public speaking events on the future of Afghanistan as well as the Future of Diplomacy Project’s programming, which examines innovation in negotiation and diplomacy.
“We try to get these practitioners as close to students as possible, not just for Kennedy School students going into foreign affairs, also to the wider Harvard community,” said Executive Director of the Future of Diplomacy Project Cathryn A. Cluver.
Cluver said the fellowship aims to help seasoned practitioners who have just left the diplomacy arena to delve into very specific diplomatic and international situations with students.
“We want them to talk about their lives and how their work has changed over the course of recent years as new challenges are emerging,” Cluver said.
From 2003 to 2010, Jawad served as the Afghan Ambassador to the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico concurrently. Previously, he worked in the Afghanistan government as President Hamid Karzai’s Press Secretary, Chief of Staff, and director of the Office of International Relations where he worked with the international community to build and restore state institutions. Jawad is currently the chairman of the Foundation for Afghanistan as well as the Chief Executive Officer of Capitalize, LLC.
“We are so fortunate to have him  after just leaving the international stage,” Cluver said, noting that Jawad was instrumental in the reconstruction in Afghanistan. “In issues like how they move forward in the reconciliation process, the role the United Nations plays in Afghanistan, the border relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, in all of these issues, he has an acute vantage point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Center for American Political Studies teamed with the Program on Constitutional Government yesterday to provide a day-after analysis on the most recent midterm election.
Following the conservative resurgence in Tuesday’s election, the largest midterm gain for either party since 1938, the event generated interest from both sides of the political divide.
Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 served as moderator for the discussion, which he said fostered an “opportunity for differing perspectives and for discussion that may not normally occur.”
The event provided a forum for William Kristol ’73—conservative political analyst and founder of the “Weekly Standard”—and William Galston—former presidential domestic policy advisor—to exchange light-hearted jabs.
In the exchange, Galston emphasized the historical importance of the recent partisan shift, noting the influence of the “Tea Party insurgency” in the House of Representatives, but also said that the further success of the Republicans Party is contingent on the strategic steps President Barack Obama takes in response.
Galston also warned that Congressional gridlock could potentially contribute to a dangerous stagnation in society.
“Americans, for a century or more, have been accustomed to believe time is on our side and history is our friend, but what if this is true no more?” he said.
Hailing the conservative victory, Kristol called the results a “great moment for America.”
He added that the new balance of power  is part of the natural cycling inherent in the political arena.Repeatedly, he lent his approval to new House Majority Leader John Boehner, pointing out that Republicans now have the power to pass House legislation and kill Senate bills.
While Kristol lauded the Republican “win for the white working class,” he also agreed with Galston, cautioning that “conservatives would be unwise to underestimate the President and his Democrats.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Leonard W. Kelliher was a boy, the five-acre plot off Western Avenue in Allston facing the back of Harvard Business School was a driving range.
“I used to pick up golf balls there for 10 cents a bucket,” Kelliher said. But that was 60 years ago, and the face of the neighborhood has since changed.
At Allston Work Team Co-chair Bill Purcell’s monthly coffee hour yesterday morning, a dozen Allston residents asked if they could ever expect to see the $1 billion Science Complex Harvard had intended to build on the site and if so, when.
Construction on the Science Complex was indefinitely halted in Dec. 2009 due to financial constraints, and the land is now a paved-over, eight-ton steel foundation, surrounded by a wooden fence and some greenery.
Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alfred referred to the concrete layer covering the foundation as “a sarcophagus,” and suggested it signaled, if not the projects’ death, the University is not planning to resume work on the site anytime soon.
Purcell said he could not provide a timeline for Harvard’s construction the Science Complex site, nor was he certain exactly what shape it would take, as the University is still exploring possibilities which would take into account both its financial constraints and academic priorities.
Purcell did not say whether the site would still be used for science-related purposes.
“We are looking at all of the possibilities and opportunities that might be out there,” he said. “Our commitment to science stays at the front, our commitment here and in the university generally, but as far as all the options that might be available, I think we’re still receiving information and advice." 
 
“Is this [the Science Complex] still Harvard’s number one priority for development?” asked Allston Resident Michael Hanlon.
Purcell did not answer the question, but said Harvard’s presence in Allston was his number one priority as Work Team Co-Chair.
“It’s a critically important part of Harvard’s future, the largest area for Harvard as it moves into the century ahead is here,” Purcell said.
Two of Harvard’s real estate consultants attended the meeting to listen to community concerns, which they said would help inform their work advising the Work Team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a few occasions this week, I’ve caught myself sitting in my room overcome with a very unfamiliar feeling: boredom. It’s the one strange week of the semester where everything has seemed to grind to a halt, and though I know the next stress cycle is just around the corner, I can’t help but be entranced by this magical feeling of having nothing of substance to do.
November at Harvard is a month of being in between. We’re stuck between fall and winter, between Halloween and the Game, between midterms and finals. And in Ancient Eight football, things are no different.
We’re now stuck between the fresh slate of a new season and being able to crown a champion. Up and down the Ivy schedule, games will oscillate between the meaningful and the relatively meaningless. While half the teams in the conference are battling to stay relevant in the race for the league title, the other four are just trying to save some face.
This week, we’ve got your high-stakes game (Yale/Brown), your de-facto-exhibition game (Dartmouth/Cornell) and a few in between. Let’s take a look around the Ivies.
YALE (5-2, 3-1 Ivy) at BROWN (4-3, 3-1)
This one’s the game to watch this weekend, because one of these teams will be effectively eliminated for the hunt for the Ivy crown with a loss. Though both squads are tied for second in the conference, both are on a little bit of a downswing—Brown got pummeled by Penn last weekend, and Yale barely held on to a big first-half lead to escape Columbia, 31-28.
The Bulldogs boast the best pass offense in the league, led by Patrick Witt’s 275 yards per game, while the Bears counter with the Ancient Eight’s best pass defense.
Brown backup quarterback Joe Springer has had plenty of time to settle into the offense at this point, but I’m not sure he can overpower the combination of Witt and running back Alex Thomas. Much as it pains me to say it, I think Yale stays in the hunt.
PREDICTION: Yale 21, Brown 17.
DARTMOUTH (4-3, 1-3) at CORNELL (2-5, 1-3)
Don’t let the identical Ivy records fool you: Dartmouth and Cornell are far from equals.
The Big Green took Penn to overtime, lost to Yale by just a field goal, and nearly made things interesting late in the game against the Crimson on Saturday.
The Big Red? Well, it beat Princeton, but that shouldn’t even count.
Losing to Harvard last week certainly puts a bit of a damper on Dartmouth’s momentum, but the Big Green just has too much talent to lose to a terrible team like Cornell. Nick Schwieger and Connor Kempe should easily lead the Big Green to another win.
PREDICTION: Dartmouth 22, Cornell 9.
PENN (6-1, 4-0) at PRINCETON (1-6, 0-4)
At this point, one can’t help but feel bad for Princeton. After falling just short at Cornell last week in the battle of the winless “titans,” the Tigers have the great misfortune of hosting red-hot Penn. The league’s best defense versus the league’s worst defense and second-worst offense? This should be as lopsided in reality as it looks on paper.
PREDICTION: Penn 37, Princeton 7.
COLUMBIA (3-4, 1-3) at HARVARD (5-2, 3-1)
Things are looking up on all counts in Cambridge. Collier Winters is back under center, Gino Gordon is continuing to dominate the Ivy League, and Harvard’s looking more and more like a championship contender every week. A pair of big games loom on the horizon, but first, the Crimson has Columbia to contend with.
The Lions are a better team than their 1-3 Ivy record may indicate, and they’ve got a talented young quarterback in Sean Brackett. The two squads boast the top two scoring offenses in the conference, so this one’s pretty much guaranteed to be a slugfest. But Harvard’s got an edge on the defensive side of the ball and an awful lot more to play for. The Crimson should get it done at home.
PREDICTION: Harvard 35, Columbia 24.

Rewind to March 12, 2010: the Harvard women’s hockey team, which had posted a 20-8-5 record on the season and garnered home ice for the opening round of the NCAA tournament, had just fallen to Cornell, 6-2, in a resounding defeat that ended the Crimson’s season.
Fast-forward to tonight, where one finds the same matchup, the same rivalry, and the same desire to win—only with a little extra motivation on the side of the Crimson.
“There’s definitely a grudge factor,” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “There’s not as much riding on this game as last season…but we’re definitely going to go out there and try and play better.”
The rematch is also the first test away from Bright Hockey Center this season for No. 10 Harvard (1-0-1, 0-0-0 ECAC), which tied Yale, 3-3, and defeated Brown, 4-2, at home in its opening weekend.
“We’re looking forward to the game as an early test against one of the top teams in our conference,” sophomore goalie Laura Bellamy said. “It’s our first game on the road and we’re excited for the challenge.”
No. 2 Cornell (4-1-0, 2-0-0 ECAC) is coming off its first loss of the season, suffered Tuesday to Mercyhurst—another team the Big Red beat on its way to the NCAA national title game last year, after Cornell managed to win its first-ever ECAC regular season and tournament championships.
The undefeated Crimson is led by tri-captain Liza Ryabkina, who scored three of Harvard’s seven goals last weekend, and Bellamy on the backline, who has a 2.41 goals-against average and a .821 save percentage.
The Crimson is tied for first in the nation in power-play conversions, having capitalized on three of its nine opportunities, while managing to stop five of the eight chances taken by opponents.
In the all-time series between the rivals, Harvard possesses a 50-19-3 advantage, although the Big Red won two of the three games against the Crimson last year.
Prior to last season, Harvard held a 10-game winning streak against Cornell and had not lost back-to-back games to the Big Red since the 1997-1998 schedule.
One notable missing member from the Crimson team will be coach Katey Stone, who will be coaching the U.S. Women’s National Team at the Four Nations Cup, which officially begins Nov. 9.
Held in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, the four-day tournament will also feature players from both the Harvard and Cornell rosters.
Josephine Pucci, a sophomore defender for the Crimson, will suit up for Team USA, while freshman Brianne Jenner and junior Rebecca Johnston will play in Canada’s red and white.
Johnston took her sophomore year off from school and hockey in order to prepare for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
She played for the Canadian National Team in five Olympic games, scoring one goal and notching five assists for six points.
Harvard remains confident in its ability to perform without Stone at the helm.
Assistant coaches Melanie Ruzzi and Maura Crowell will lead the Crimson against Cornell tonight and Colgate tomorrow.
“It’s definitely going to be a different dynamic on the bench, but at the same time, Coach prepared us very well,” Buesser said. “The captains and senior leaders on the team know what’s expected…and strong leadership on team will fill in gap.”
One thing that Stone emphasized to her team was not getting caught up in rivalries or redemption games.
Instead, Harvard realizes it must take each match as its own challenge.
“Although we have Ivy rivalries, there’s such a competitive edge with every team this year,” Buesser said. “There’s no one game that we consider to be bigger than another in our schedule.”
“There’s no doubt that the returning players remember the way our season ended, but that’s a feeling we used as motivation throughout the offseason,” Bellamy added. “Now it’s all about this year’s team and giving our best effort no matter who the opponent is.”
So despite the history—both last season’s and throughout the years—the Crimson will face tonight’s match as it would any other: as a team ready to win.
“It’s going to be a battle,” Buesser said. “But we just have to play our game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football has plenty to lose this weekend.
A win for the Crimson (5-2, 3-1 Ivy League) in tomorrow’s home matchup against Columbia (3-4, 1-3) would allow Harvard to stay in contention for the Ivy League championship.
A loss, on the other hand, would drop the Crimson’s record further below that of Penn (6-1, 4-0) and dramatically reduce its chances at a title.
“At this point in the season, every game is our most important game,” captain Collin Zych said.  “We have to win every Ivy League game to achieve our goal of winning the Ivy League. We have to put ourselves in the position to compete for the title next week.”
With a date against the current league leaders and The Game on the horizon, it would be easy for the Crimson to overlook the Lions, currently fifth in the Ancient Eight. But junior quarterback Collier Winters feels strongly that will not be the case.
“All this week we’ve been getting everyone to make sure they’re thinking about only Columbia and helping them realize that the Penn and Yale games won’t matter nearly as much if we don’t beat Columbia,” said Winters, who was named Ivy League Football Offensive Player of the Week last week after compiling 212 passing yards and no interceptions against Dartmouth.
Meanwhile, the Lions are coming off a 31-28 loss to Yale last weekend—Columbia’s second-consecutive loss by a margin of three points. According to Harvard coach Tim Murphy, losses like these prove the Lions’ 1-3 record is not indicative of their ability as a team.
“This is a good football team,” Murphy said. “I mean, they’re really well-coached, they challenge you in their scheme, and they’ve got good personnel. They just haven’t been able to close the deal recently. But you look at what they’ve shown at times—hanging 42 points on Princeton, hanging 42 points on Lafayette—they’re a good football team.”
Zych noted that Columbia’s ability to specifically adjust to each defense it faces will pose a challenge for Harvard.
As such, a focus in the Crimson’s practices this week was recognizing some of the many faces of the Lions’ unpredictable offense.
“They’ve had a different identity on offense in every game that I’ve watched [on film] so far,” Zych said. “It’s hard to prepare exactly for what they are going to do. They have found different things that work against different schemes of defenses, and they adjust to them in ways that aren’t really traditional.”
Based on the Harvard defensive line’s dominant performance in last weekend’s 30-14 victory over Dartmouth, Murphy anticipates Columbia will center its game plan on the front four—especially senior defensive tackle Josué Ortiz, who had four tackles and two sacks against the Big Green.
Although the Lions’ offense has learned to adapt to each of its opponents, one thing has remained constant throughout the season: sophomore quarterback Sean Brackett’s cannon of an arm.
Brackett has thrown 16 touchdown passes this season and leads the league in passing efficiency by a significant margin at 152.4.
“He’s able to make plays with his speed, which makes him a good player,” Zych said. “With our defensive line being a strength this year, hopefully we can keep him from escaping the pocket and making plays. We need to make sure we know our responsibilities on option plays and making sure he won’t be able to run free.”
While Columbia’s offense may seem variable at times, Winters, who will make his second start of the year, and the rest of the attack are fairly confident in facing the Lions’ defense—headlined by middle linebacker Alex Gross, the league’s leader in tackles.
“Where we are right now compared to where we were in the middle of the season [in terms of number of injuries to starters], we have a better ability to diversify our game plan,” Winters said. “We can open up our playbook more and have more options to give guys the opportunity to make plays. We have a good chance of having a solid offensive day.”
On the offensive end, the Crimson will aim to uphold a philosophy that has grown more and more important as the battle for the Ivy League title continues.
“There’s an expression in war that does translate also to our sport, and that is that if they know where you’re going to be, eventually they’re going to blow you up,” Murphy said. “If they know your tendencies and you’re just fixated on one part of your game, they’re eventually going to get to you, even if you’re really good. So for us to be as unpredictable in every field zone, every down-and-distance situation, has always been a key to our success here at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you gotten your Harvard-Yale ticket yet? Well, you better go to the Murr Center soon if you haven’t, because tomorrow is the last day to pick up free tickets. And while you’re down by the river, you can check out these exciting matchups happening at home this weekend.
After taming the Tigers and taking down the Big Green the last two weekends, the Harvard football team takes on the Columbia Lions. Now 5-2 for the season, the men return home after two games on the road for the matchup tomorrow at noon. In last year’s meeting, Harvard dominated the match, scoring 14 points in the first six minutes of the game. The Crimson extended the lead to 34-0 in the fourth quarter, and Harvard won the game, 34-14. This will be the 69th meeting between the teams, with Harvard leading 53-14-1.
If you haven’t seen a soccer match, this is your last chance! The men’s and women’s soccer squads both take on Columbia at Ohiri Field on Senior Day tomorrow for the last home matches of the season. Currently on a three-game losing streak, the men’s team looks to break out of its slump against the Lions. Last season, Harvard scored a 2-1 victory against Columbia in overtime. The women’s squad also lost its match last weekend to Dartmouth but owns a 7-7-1 record. Harvard holds a 20-3-1 record over the Lions and has won the last two meetings, both 2-1 overtime decisions. The women play at 11 a.m. and the men play right after at 1:30 p.m.
The men’s ice hockey team kicks off its regular season this weekend, playing against Union tonight at 7 p.m. at the Bright Hockey Arena and Rensselaer tomorrow night at the same time and place. The men faced the Swedish National Under-20 team on Monday, but lost the scrimmage, 2-1. And for all the Pfoho students, tonight is Pfoho night, with the first 250 students getting free t-shirts!
The women’s ice hockey team takes on Cornell and Colgate tonight and tomorrow afternoon on the road. The women have played two conference matches so far and hold a 1-0-1 record for the season. The Big Red holds a No. 2 ranking nationally and beat Harvard in the NCAA quarterfinals last year, so the women will have to step up their game to take down the No. 2 squad.
In its last match of the season, the field hockey team takes on Columbia at home tomorrow at 1 p.m. The women are currently on an eight-game losing streak but have this last chance at redemption and look to end the season on a good note. The Crimson lost to the Lions last season, but it was close. Columbia won the match in overtime, 2-1.
The women’s volleyball team hits the road for two conferences matches against Brown tonight and Yale tomorrow night. The women dropped a tight five-set match to Columbia last weekend, but won the two games before the loss. One of those wins was a 3-1 victory over Brown at home, but the squad dropped a 3-1 game to Yale earlier in the season.
Finally, there are some big tournaments happening this weekend, as one team looks to extend its season by moving on and two teams wrap up their individual seasons. The men’s water polo team competes in the CWPA Northern Division Championship, hoping to earn a spot in the CWPA Eastern Championships. The men’s tennis squad travels to Flushing Meadows, N.Y., the site of the US Open, for the ITA Indoor National Championships. Finally, the women’s team competes at home this weekend in the Harvard Invitational.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students we’re all experts in procrastination, but there’s one thing you don’t want to put off.
Tomorrow is the last day for undergraduates to pick up free tickets for the 127th playing of The Game at Harvard Stadium on Nov. 20.
With the matchup only two weeks away, there’s just enough time to catch up on the history of one of the oldest rivalries in college football.
The first meeting between Harvard and Yale took place in New Haven, Conn. in 1875 and ended with the Crimson pulling out the 4-0 victory (at the time the only way to score was on the equivalent of a PAT). Since then, the Bulldogs have gained a 65-53-8 advantage in the series.
The matchup wasn’t referred to as “The Game” until 1898 in a letter between Harvard’s captain and head coach. The name was then made popular in the mid-1900s, when press coverage of the rivalry increased.
To get in on the tradition, make sure to pick up a free ticket at the Murr Center Ticket Office or Bright Hockey Arena Ticket Window sometime between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. tomorrow. After then, tickets will be available for purchase.

This afternoon at 2:18 p.m., the John Harvard statue was treated to a free makeover, courtesy of Harvard Hillel.
In anticipation of Hillel’s biggest party of the year, a crowd of students danced, sang Klezmer songs, and waved signs reading "John Harvard’s Bar Mitzvah." The group also adorned the statue with traditional bar mitzvah accoutrements: a kippa (skullcap) and a tallis (prayer shawl).
John Harvard’s Bar Mitzvah is Hillel’s biggest party of the year. "He's a big boy now," joked Harvard Hillel President Nell S. Hawley '10-'11. "It's time to fly in all the relatives from Jersey/Florida, read some Torah, eat some bagels, and party like it's 2002," she said.
The party will happen on Saturday, Nov. 6, from 10 p.m.-1 a.m., in the Hillel building (52 Mt. Auburn Street).The organizers said they hope the college-style bar mitzvah, which will feature a popular Israeli DJ, will raise awareness of Jewish culture on campus.
Hillel members said they were excited for this weekend’s festivities. "These are my people," said Joshua B. Lipson '14, who said he loves Hillel’s community spirit.
And the decision to decorate the statue? "We needed to do something crazy," said Hawley. She said she hopes that other campus organizations will follow suit with similar attempts at "extreme publicity."
Although Hawley asked, "Don't you think this school is a bit too WASP-y for its own good?" before heading to the Yard, she said afterwards that she was pleased with the turnout:
"I think Harvard Hillel just reclaimed Harvard Yard," she said.

Odds are you’ve heard about the Firesheep hysteria by now. If you still aren’t sure what to do about it, here’s a short guide to help keep your Internet experience safe.
One dangerous aspect of Firesheep is that it affects popular websites such as Facebook and Twitter, according to CS50 professor David J. Malan ’99. The reason for such widespread susceptibility is that many websites do not use protocols for security over the internet (also known as SSL) and are thus not very secure.
Although Malan said that online e-mail services may be at risk, Gmail—a favorite of students—in fact uses SSL and should not be affected. However, Malan noted that Gmail is not necessarily infallible, since some accounts are used to access other web services.
Malan’s biggest piece of advice is to use a virtual private network (VPN) client, which allows a user to access a network securely. Harvard students can access the FAS VPN server by going to vpn.fas.harvard.edu. Note: you must enter your username as [username]@fas.harvard.edu.
In addition to the VPN server, there are free Firefox plugins to boost browsing security, such as HTTPS Everywhere and Force-TLS. These programs attempt to change a website’s Hypertext Transfer Protocol from HTTP to the more secure HTTPS. Unfortunately, these add-ons may not be entirely effective. "They only work if the website supports SSL, as it is more expensive for them to run SSL," Malan said.
In short, here are some tips:
1. Look for sites      that use HTTPS. These are more secure and most reliable.
2. For secure      network access, use VPN.
3. Keep in mind that      your e-mail may not be secure.
4. Try downloading      HTTPS Everywhere and Force-TLS.
5. Although      tempting, try to avoid accessing vulnerable sites like Facebook during a      big lecture class (and on public Wi-Fi in general).
The most important thing to do is to be smart about surfing the web and not to take security on the Internet for granted. "Odds are if you can see someone across the room, they could be snooping on you," Malan said, while stressing the uncertainty of how things will play out with Firesheep. "Things are going to be a little unsafe for a while," he said.
