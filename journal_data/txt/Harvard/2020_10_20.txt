He is from
speckled dirt in sour beer,
from the swaying hips of el barrio
and its fog of heat under the stars that can fix
everything underneath them, swears
he’ll reach them in a couple years;
give him time and she’ll touch them too in a couple years.
He is from
streets swarmed with salchipapas-y-chicha vendors, swears
there’s nothing the hips of el barrio and a beer
can’t fix.
Though, if he had time, he’d give el barrio
the cleanness of her irises; he’d give el barrio
the freckles her nose has collected like dust over the years.
He’d scrub the hunger from the walls, the grumbling moms can’t fix.
He is from
old stories wish-washing at the bottom of his beer
and the salsa songs he can’t sing, says
there’s something different about where she’s from, says
“you’re from paved roads; my barrio
has a filth that’ll forever cloud my beer,
the kind that’ll soil stories for the rest of my years.
I’m from
a crater of a city my favorite constellation couldn’t fix.
I’m from a crater of a house whose roof I couldn’t fix.”
He offers her another drink, and that’s all he says.
Four blocks worth of Jesus on chains and burglar friends, is where he’s from.
El barrio
is his fingernails’ dirt, packed in even after all these years,
is the unleaving grime on the glass bottle of his beer.
He tells her about el barrio when he tips back his beer,
when he looks at the dent of her dimple and wishes it would fix
all of his previous years.
He says
he looks at the clouds above his barrio
and wishes they would sweep him away from where he’s from.
He is from the specks of dirt still whirling in his beer,
born from the swaying hips of el barrio, raised under a fog of heat by the stars that could fix
everything underneath. Says, he wishes to live under a different sky with her for many years.

i am dead but i am not gone and departure is no longer in my sight because you wont let me flee or let me let myself stand up and walk across the water and i wont let you let me leave us all either because something more waits for me and for us but not you behind the veil that stole my voice and hid it away before i could catch it and hold it in my mouth but no tongue behind teeth means no words outside teeth until the tongue is no longer necessary in a world reversed by sea and words can walk freely but my words hide behind your eyes like lighting between chasms that no hands can grasp before it turns to liquid and slides out of your body like oceanwater falling from the earth into the sky where we all will be.
i belong nowhere inbetween two worlds of unknown and known unknown where survival falls after removal made by man but i am no man and never will be no matter how hard they try no matter how hard you try whether you like it or not because my name is lost and will never be found because iyouwe are determined to find it hiding in the earth that hangs in the sky that threatens to fall with every tear we dont cry and in my tears i dont cry not because i am not permitted but because my tears mix with the sea and become the salt of the earth and your tears too if you cry in sorrow for no one other than me and the rest of humanity who is everyone that glows blue inside from the shell of my soul beating amongst yours and hers and his until we together give birth to new love and new light and new hate and new happiness and new anger and new darkness to kill that darkness that wrapped its invisible grip around my neck to kill me because the sorcerer of that darkness who is more than just one claims greatness over others to mask its smallness which turns to emptiness when expanded.
i teach and am taught to love but love dissipates into the air from the sea in vapor to a point where love slips between my fingers but i hold onto it and i never relinquish those invisible treasures from between the folds of my skin because i know it and the love i am still able to project will be the only thing that saves the world when the world is lost and for that reason they hate that i hold onto it and can see it in my eyes just as i see in theirs a nothingness that awaits to be subsumed by the hatred that burns flames against water no matter which side they are on.
i lie under a mast and flag that fights another in a fight of language versus language and mast versus mast but no heart versus heart except our own which watch the smell of burning gunpowder sink into the air and feel the glint of iron collars emerge from decks and hear the sight of those figures who are recognized as bodies only after the fact launch into the water and turn to red in the wake of the sharks while they without hearts flee to the world which once was our world.
i become lamentations for those lost and pity for those not lost and i am not mentioned other than in a representation of a girl searching for her legs and another her right arm and a third the piece of body that once filled a hole of torn edges but where am i in those cries for liberty and grief and deliverance that do nothing more but steal us from one world and supplant us to liminality of existence within a space settled by the resettled.
life cannot be returned to a space destroyed.
i am alive in death and after death and whether i be named or nameless i will walk through the skies above your head to reach the heights that iron collars and iron leashes attempted to keep me from but never could from when the mast that claimed liberation was once the mast that claimed destruction to now because the wood remains the same because masts are of neither liberty nor despotism but rather are both engulfed in flames that never will and never were meant to be extinguished because the power of a new mast arises from the ashes of the one preceding it but no matter their efforts to set the world on fire when they claim our humanity but the eternal vapor in our skin strengthens us to slip between their grasp and rise above their paper legitimacy that eventually absolves all tyrants when they devour their own humanity where there is no more humanity in front of them to devour and even so we remain we survive we persist we reclaim our rights beyond the body.
to be numbers is not to be.
we sing in hidden voices.
listen.

Mother didn’t want me to venture onto the deck alone. Twice a day she hurried me along to the quarterdeck for me to watch the captain steer the ship, but it was never too captivating. The man smelled of dirty soap and stale clothes and was never too fond of Mother. He was always glad to see me, but I would’ve much rather explored the ship on my own.
Being cooped up in the apartment all day and night became dreadful week after week, especially considering I had to share a room with Mother, Rachelle, and Amelia. Occasionally Mother, always followed by Amelia, ventured to the captain’s cabin to speak with him, but she never lingered for long. Only sometimes could I find enough time to escape to the fresh air momentarily. Rachelle was supposed to follow me wherever I went, but I threatened to tell Mother that she stole a biscuit when Mother wasn’t looking if anyone found out I had disobeyed her orders. It wasn’t entirely a lie; I did catch her shoving a biscuit into her pockets one evening when no one else was around, but that was months ago.
There’s something about the ocean air that enlivens a soul — the wind against your face, the soft spray of seawater cooling your skin. Mother told me I’d adore New Orleans far more than the comptoir, but I’d heard from the other girls that New Orleans was a dirty city blown down by a storm; however, Mother was making me wait until we arrived before I made any judgments. She said it’d be good practice.
“Hi girlie,” a boy said with a tap on my shoulder.
I yelped and leaped forward, causing the unnamed boy to yank my arm back towards him. “Ouch!” I yelled, falling to the ground. “Why did you do that?”
“Sorry, girlie. You jumped so high I thought you might fall. I didn’t mean to scare you like that,” he said, reaching for my hand.
“My name isn’t ‘Girlie.’”
“Then what is it?”
“Juliette Pinet.”
“I thought you might be her.”
“And what led you to believe that?”
“The men told me there was a beautiful girlie wandering around, said she was traveling with the creole woman and her two slaves. I’m surprised I got to meet the ghost.”
“I can assure you I’m no ghost,” I said, brushing the dirt from my skirt.
“My name is Jacob,” he said with a foolishly puffed up chest.
“Normally, it would have been a pleasure to meet you; however, I must be leaving.”
“No, don’t go!”
“And why is that?”
“Because,” he said, “I want to know you. Not many other people our age aboard.” I cocked my head in exasperation; if I wasn’t careful, Mother might catch me. “How old are you?”
“I’m 11.”
“Look at that! I’m 14. I’m the youngest of the crew. I’m going to become a sailor.”
“Wonderful,” I responded.
“You speak funny.”
“Excuse me?”
“Your accent. What is it?”
“French.”
“No, it’s not. I’m French; you sound wrong.”
Before I could chide him for his rudeness, someone yanked me backward.
“Juliette!” Mother grasped my arm and pulled me away from Jacob. “What are you doing on the deck by yourself! I told you not to leave without me. Who is this boy? You should know better!”
“Mother, I needed air. The apartment is unbearable,” I whined.
“That is no way to speak to your mother. Didn’t I take you to see Captain Préville two hours ago?” He appeared from behind her and tipped his hat to me. “Was his visit not enough for you?”
“Yes, but — ”
“‘Yes, but’ nothing, young lady. Now apologize to him.”
I assumed her request for an apology was to end the quarrel as soon as possible. At the moment, obliging was the best option. “I apologize, Captain Préville.”
“No need to apologize. It’s only natural for a young lady to need fresh air,” the large man said, bending down to face me. “I heard that your birthday is approaching. December 1st?”
“Yes.”
“Just short of when we are expected to make landfall in New Orleans.”
“Maybe we can celebrate on the ship?” Jacob interjects.
“Who is this boy?” Mother demands.
“No one,” Captain Préville said. “Lelievre, leave us.”
“But,” he protested.
Captain Préville raised to a monstrous height, a threat enough for the boy to scurry away but not before he snuck one last glimpse at me. His eyes pleaded for something unspoken.
The captain with a renewed sense of geniality pulled something out of his coat pocket. “I was saving this until we arrived, but I couldn’t keep such a beautiful gift from a beautiful lady for much longer.” It was a rose. “‘A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.’”
“Thank you,” I knew I should say. The petals were wilted and a few had brown splotches. If I didn’t pinch the stem hard with two fingers near the bud, the wretched thing would have toppled to the side.
“Oh, your father would love that,” Mother exclaimed, her loose curls bouncing with glee.
Captain Préville turned to tower over Mother with a sudden shift in disposition. Besides walking on the ship alone, there was one other rule: Don’t speak of Father. People weren’t happy with his choices, why he was sent to New Orleans. Many were unhappy with his marriage too. Father’s missteps brought unwanted attention to us — the kind Mother worked to shield me from.
“Assuredly,” he spat. A bell rang from the mast. “It seems like you two should head back to your cabin where no one can bother you,” he hissed to Mother. She looked small beside him. Without another word, she snatched my arm and pulled me down to our stuffy apartment.
Before she spanked me she slapped Rachelle for letting me escape. The small tear that came from her eye dissuaded me from fibbing to Mother about the biscuit. It didn’t feel good to see someone hurt on your account.
She sent me to bed early that night. I stared for what felt like hours at the rotting rose on my nightstand with the sting of her hand against my cheek and the sting of guilt in my heart. She said father didn’t kill that man they claimed he did, but that if he did, he did it to protect us. Only now, it was only us.
I awoke to what I thought was a shriek. With a jolt, I looked around in the dark, but no one else seemed to have been disturbed. Ensuring as to not wake Mother, I quietly pulled on my boots and left for the deck, careful to move without a sound.
The deck was lit into hues of grays and black from the glow of moonbeams. The lack of clouds and the loud wind rippling the sails sent shivers down my back. I stopped, mesmerized by the stillness on the rocking ship. Even when I was the only person on the deck during the daylight, I’d never felt this alone.
Another sharp shriek came from farther down the deck that was immediately muffled; the quiet suffering froze my blood. I ran to where I thought the sound originated and fell to the ground to search through the uneven planks for its owner, but through the dark I found nothing. The muffled screams suddenly halted. All that was left was the empty sound of lungs lying of their emptiness.
Before I could discern what’d happened, the sound of two pairs of feet from below startled me upright. At the opposite end of the deck, two pale ghosts emerged from nowhereland. It was a man whom I’d never seen with a hand on that boy Jacob’s shoulder. The man looked proud like a monster, but Jacob, his eyes were emptied.
“It would be wise of you to get back to bed. You wouldn’t want to catch a cold,” the man sneered as he walked past. Jacob didn’t look at me; he didn’t blink. They descended to the crew’s quarters, and the ship turned to purgatory once more.
I knew what Mother tried to hide from me. I heard her whisper to Rachelle the horrors I mustn’t see when she thought I was asleep, that she needed to protect me from the fears that could consume me. Only now did I realize horrors don’t have to be seen to be known.
A soft wail came from beneath my feet, one that knew it was to be forsaken for eternity. Souls drifted away with the mist. I stood amid the deathscape I could not put to words. The sea was dark in its emptiness yet reflective of everything. Only, there was no world to see. I looked over the edge and peered into my shadow self beneath the water. Its darkness rippled in the waves, but something peculiar stood out to me: its eyes were gray like the moon. Mine are brown.

“Alex is the love of my life.”
Just 30 seconds into writer-director Pete Murimi’s documentary “I Am Samuel,” the titular subject makes this quiet, matter-of-fact declaration. A shaky camera follows Samuel and Alex into the woods — through a waterfall and a makeshift tire swing, down a winding, sunny strip of road. Alex rests his arm on Samuel’s tense shoulder, as he does often throughout the film. For those first few moments, their love feels like the simplest thing in the world.
Samuel and Alex live in Kenya, where LGBTQ+ love and identity are criminalized. Their lives are by no means free of the pain of that reality, an undercurrent woven through every subsequent scene.
But unlike many filmmakers who choose to depict people with experiences of trauma, violence, and family rejection, Murimi doesn’t define or dehumanize his subjects based on that violence, or paint their relationship as perfect just because it’s hard-won. Rather, with a light touch and an intimate style, he shows Samuel and Alex just as they are — radically, beautifully normal.
It’s clear from the outset that “I Am Samuel” is no Netflix documentary; there is no melodramatic music, no climactic interrogations, no desperation to leave its audience with one particular emotion. Shot vérité style (improvisation and observation-focused) over the course of five years, Murimi opts for short, understated shots of daily life imbued with the intimacy of a home movie. He shies away from the heavy-handed music or emotional push-pulls of more mainstream documentaries, trusting the eyes and expressions of his subjects to speak for themselves.
Any documentary centered on daily intimacy relies on trust, a necessity only exacerbated by a topic as painful and secretive as criminalized sexuality. The depth, then, of the trust and level of vulnerability between subject and filmmaker is perhaps “I Am Samuel”’s greatest accomplishment. Murimi seems able to capture every shade of emotion from his generous, passionate “Samuel.” Unlike in many other documentaries that rely on their subjects' vulnerability, Murimi doesn’t capture these moments by erasing his positionality or “accidentally” stumbling upon a moment of secret weakness. Rather, his subject feels almost relieved by his presence — as if Murimi and his camera have provided a genuine outlet for a young man desperate to be truly seen.
Of course, Murimi certainly does not waste those windows into Samuel‘s soul. He has an uncanny eye for the physicalities of inner turmoil, lingering on moments of bodily tension, longing, and desire. In one series of memorable shots early on in the film, Samuel visits his family before he’s come out to them or introduced them to Alex. Murimi cuts directly to the old woman’s scrunched-up face in sharp focus, framing it between Samuel’s hands as he massages it and they laugh and tease each other. That night, the two sit far apart from each other; Samuel’s body language is desperate and wary as he chats on the phone with Alex. A simple “how are you?” becomes burdened with a thousand more tender questions; the crickets in the background cut through the hesitation in their conversation. The lamp above him throws the tension in Samuel’s arms into focus again as he hugs them to his chest, back against the darkness.
Murimi’s visual creativity also extends to the things his camera chooses to focus on. In one scene at a church service, he frames Samuel’s frustrated, introspective face in sharp detail, while keeping the blurry outline of Samuel’s father’s face just in the background. These kinds of shots are sprinkled throughout the film to powerful effect, forcibly showing the distance of being closeted from a family member, even if they’re physically a few feet away.
Of course, being queer in Kenya comes with less subtle consequences, too. Partway through the film, Alex experiences a brutal assault, as does an anonymous victim at the film’s start. In both cases, Murimi seems reticent to extract painful emotion out of his subjects, and they seem to prefer holding it in, limiting their pain to little changes in their expression and strained, choked-up laughter.
At times, these shifts between the couple’s precious moments together and the violence of the outside world feel rushed and abrupt, as though they were stitched together without a clear emotional arc in kind. Standard documentary tropes — such as asking the subjects how they felt about a scene after it unfolded, or lingering on their pained expressions as they respond — would likely have smoothed over many of these abrupt moments. But Murimi’s refusal to feed predicted or linear emotions to his subjects or his viewers allowed Samuel to tell his own story, free of the exploitative undertones so common in documentaries. Who, then, is “I Am Samuel” for? Does it hope to build empathy or change hearts, minds, or policies?
The answer may be neither. Though lacking the focus of one particular agenda, “I Am Samuel” is arguably more valuable. As Murimi put it: “It is very rare for a poor, uneducated gay man to be given a platform to tell his story from his point of view, particularly in Kenya where such love is not accepted by society.” “I Am Samuel,” foregoes the emotional manipulation of many modern documentaries — leaving Samuel to tell his own story. Without a heavy-handed emotional filter, “I Am Samuel” succeeds in presenting queer love as it truly is: radically, refreshingly normal.

Who’s afraid of “Saturday Night Live“?
It used to be President Trump, who threatened an FCC probe into the show in response to its repeated jabs at him over the past four years. Now, in its Season 46 premiere, the show feels so timid that it can barely provoke a reaction at all — much less laughter.
In recent years, the show’s development has stalled, flattening its riskier humor into sketches so obvious and surface-level they’re almost condescending. Remote filming was an obvious struggle for the show, but it produced some genius surrealist sketches over these past few months in quarantine. (“Eleanor’s House,” Aidy Bryant’s play on a children’s animation show gone horribly wrong, was particularly memorable) One would think that a return to Studio 8H would restore its rhythm and catapult it back to its pre-COVID glory, but in its premiere, the show has again failed to hit its stride.
The episode opens with a U.S. presidential debate sketch starring Jim Carrey as Joe Biden and Alec Baldwin as President Trump. With source material that could likely function as satire all on its own, one would think that SNL couldn’t possibly mess up the sketch. But they did.
Satire of this increasingly intense election works best when it clutches onto the intricate ticks of the hyper-energetic race — the awkwardness of the new debate format or the frustratingly benign moderators — which this sketch doesn’t even attempt to do. Wasting Maya Rudolph’s appearance on a terribly contrived line (“America needs a WAP: Woman As President,”) is one of the times it’s too on-the-nose, leaving no possibility of subversion. Instead, empty crowd-pleasing is the name of the game, where people laugh just because there’s a celebrity on the stage, not because the jokes carry any weight.
This attitude continues across the later sketches: “NBA Bubble” showcases a slate of opportunistic women attempting to quarantine with professional basketball teams. In this and other sketches, the joke never advances beyond a repetitive, 8th-grade punchline.
Chris Rock, an often-biting comedian, comes off as slightly less so in his host monologue about how COVID-19 has disrupted our daily routines. When Rock — a multimillionaire whose wealth will probably ensure he’ll be just fine in the sea of oncoming global crises — bemoans the U.S. government’s corruption and quotes James Baldwin, it comes off as entirely unconvincing.
As usual, the real stars are the women. Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage” performance is an incredibly potent claim to her agency and life as an artist. A Malcolm X quote interrupts the song while the words “Protect Black Women” are displayed on the wall. She proclaims: “We need to protect our Black women, and love our Black women.”
Chloe Fineman’s spoof of “The Drew Barrymore Show“ is another standout: She is wry and perfectly exaggerated, hinting at how enthusiasm on talk shows can be deceptive in the wake of the Ellen DeGeneres labor scandal. Another sharp sketch is the song “Bottom Of Your Face,” featuring the dynamic duo of Ego Nwodim and Megan Thee Stallion — a magnetic rap pairing. On "Weekend Update, Colin Jost and Michael Che fall prey to the week’s chaotic news cycle and end up laughing at themselves — a bit which used to be charming, but has gotten old very quickly. In that segment, Bowen Yang’s Chinese trade secretary Chen Biao is a welcome reprieve (“She’s doing the work on racism from her family’s house in Nantucket” is one of the best lines of the night), but also hackneyed: Yang seems to be trapped playing the same character, and doesn’t get to show off his range.
Comedy, at its best, can acknowledge that the world which audiences are living in is fundamentally strange, stressful, and confusing. It can provide a reprieve, and it can force us to reckon with the deeper, scarier truths of our existence while also having a laugh. Can audiences expect SNL to get to that deeper place anymore, or will it continue to fill its weekly slots with timid, celebrity-filled, flashy escapism?
As most of the country’s live entertainment is canceled for the foreseeable future amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s all the more sad that “SNL” — which has returned in semi-full capacity with a live audience of paid first responders — is so unwilling to take risks in its premiere.

In its first episode, “Helstrom,” Hulu/Marvel’s new show, diverges from the purely action-packed, hero stories typical to Marvel’s big-budget “Avengers” lineup.
In the beginning of the dark and moody premiere, “Mother’s Little Helpers,” viewers are introduced to Dr. Louise Hastings (June Carryl), the administrator of a mysterious, well-connected asylum in Portland, Ore. As the dark suspense builds, we meet Daimon (Tom Austen) and Ana (Sydney Lemmon), brother and sister of the Helstrom family. It’s immediately clear that this is no natural family — it’s one with a vague and dark past riddled with pain, separation, and even possession. Despite going off the beaten path of Marvel content, “Mother’s Little Helpers” still captivates the audience with incredible visuals, immersive scoring, and a well-paced sense of foreboding.
Throughout this premiere episode of the Marvel-Hulu partnership, there are still tastes of classic Marvel dialogue: a mix of lighthearted joking and drama between characters with yet-to-be divulged pasts. In the first 15 minutes of the show, we see Daimon attempt to perform an exorcism, only to find that the child is faking and the family really needs counseling, not religious help — a teaser for the kind of humor and content we can expect throughout the season.
Very quickly, however, the show takes a darker turn. A group of three gentlemen break into a mysterious crypt in Colma, Calif., only to find a mysteriously-placed sarcophagus wrapped in metallic snakes. In an abrupt tonal change, we see the first grisly murder of the episode and season. With this death and what comes later in the episode, it becomes clear that this is a show that's willing to break the typical Marvel mold, another change in the post-Infinity Saga era.
To establish the show, rather than introducing characters outright, we are slowly introduced to the cast through tasteful introductions of their role within the series. Daimon is seen performing a mock-exorcism and displaying a glimpse of his mysterious demonic powers, as the audience gets a glimpse of his cynical, complacent approach to everyday life. Ana is seen manipulating an abusive and murderous billionaire, demonstrating complete apathy and separation from the potential implications of her actions. “Helstrom” does a masterful job of building exposition by showing, not telling — introducing us to the key players seamlessly and efficiently.
To add to the mood throughout the show, ominous music and creative sound effects heighten the suspense and draw in the audience. The most artful example in the episode appears as Daimon and Ana are both experiencing shocks from their childhoods — memories they’ve worked their entire lives to suppress. The audience is more able to empathize with the protagonists because of an incredibly well-placed and scored montage switching between each sibling as they reminisce. With swooning and eerie sounds and gentle musical overtones, the scene is snappy and elegantly grabs the audience’s attention.
With the show’s well-done scoring and character development as support, the actors and writing are able to flourish. The lesser-known cast excels with clear chemistry; in particular, Austen and Lemmon play off each other as if they are truly siblings. The mismatched and somewhat chaotic family and friends creates a relatable and diverse cast of characters for future episodes.
The show’s ability to maintain an air of secrecy, tension, and curiosity makes it one of this fall’s highlights. With glimpses of demon skulls and newspaper clippings from lives past, the show artfully establishes some of what is to come in the remaining episodes of the season. “Helstrom” is sure to be an exciting and thrilling show for the duration of its run as a Hulu exclusive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tear gas floods from canisters propelled by officers outfitted in bullet proof vests. The target? Thousands of demonstrators marching through the streets armed only with hand-painted signs. While unique tragedies and trauma forge the fury in each voice, their message is the same: “Our lives matter.”
No, we’re not describing the local Black Lives Matter protests that took place in the United States this spring. This is the reality now in Nigeria, as the #EndSARS movement reignites Nigeria’s four-year struggle against police brutality and the nation’s young people resist government efforts to suppress their renewed strides toward justice.
The fight to end police brutality does not end at the U.S. borders; and it requires global collaboration.
Fed up with its reputation for excessive and unlawful force, #EndSARS demands elected officials abolish the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of Nigeria’s police force created in 1992 to deal with crimes involving armed robbery, vehicle theft, and kidnapping.
In the tradition of Black Lives Matter, university-aged students and activists are #EndSARS’ nucleus. They employ social media as a mobilizing force, attracting global attention after #EndSARS trended on Twitter featuring countless posts recounting stories and sharing videos of intimidation, extortion, sexual assault, kidnapping, and extrajudicial killings. Nigeria’s youth continue to block major roads across the country and combat government officials who act as a hindrance to the development of better institutions that actually work for the benefit of the people.
As an attempt to subdue protestors, Nigeria’s Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, announced last week that SARS would be dissolved and replaced by a pre-existing patrol force, the Special Weapons and Tactics team. However, the move, which merely disperses former SARS officials into the larger police force, is not enough to satisfy the appetite of protestors who have spent weeks reclaiming their agency on the same streets where most have been victims of violent harassment. Protests across Nigeria continue to rage in pursuit of greater progress and restorative justice.
Nonetheless, #EndSARS should not be misdiagnosed as a conflict simply between Nigerians and their leadership. Its significance extends far beyond Nigeria’s borders. It is a call not only to abolish a unit of Nigeria’s police force, but also to fundamentally repair the broken global systems and cultures that normalize state sanctioned violence and foster law enforcement’s long-standing reign of terror.
#EndSARS and its successes are inextricably tied to our own.
After George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other unarmed Black Americans were murdered by police officers, the United States saw a very similar outcry against police brutality that brought organized protests to nearly every major city and conversations about systemic racism to many kitchen tables.
U.S. policing has historically racist origins, and police brutality, along with the white supremacist institutions and attitudes that enable it, directly descends from the criminalization of Black people beginning with our enslavement. Policing in Nigeria, however, finds its inception in colonialism, introduced by the British as a tool to facilitate the exploitation of African nations. Corruption, lack of regard for human rights, and stifled democracy are contemporary residuals of this white supremacist intervention.
#EndSARS and its formation complicate a predominant American narrative in which racism is centered as a catalyst for police brutality. After all, despite being citizens of the world’s most prosperous Black nation, Nigerian’s still find themselves needing to remind their government that Black lives matter.
From a very young age, Black people in the U.S. live with a heightened awareness that their skin color is perceived as a pretext for criminality, leaving them subject to undue interactions with racially-biased law enforcement. Unlike the U.S., Nigeria is predominantly Black, so police officers select alternative criteria for profiling such as perceived affluence and sexual orientation, among other identifiers. SARS’s liberal use of profiling and violence — though not race-based like in the U.S. — creates a similar culture of instability and fear for Nigerian youth that parallels the Black experience in America and demonstrates how Black people worldwide are being robbed of their power and agency.
Nigerians and Americans are not strangers. Our struggles should not be either. U.S. literature is filled with cultural references to Yoruba Gods, and Burna Boy is commonplace on many Black American playlists. However, American allyship with Nigeria must go farther than a romantic association with their culture. Nigerians and Americans need to unify in our fights against police brutality while acknowledging the nuances of how it manifests in each of our countries. Even though Nigeria’s narratives about, manifestations of, and history with policing fundamentally differ from ours, Black Lives Matter and #EndSARS are intertwined and cannot be isolated movements.
Over the summer, when U.S. demonstrations against police brutality peaked, the international community responded with overwhelming displays of support for Black people in America. By virtue of the U.S. position within the larger world, we had the privilege of assuming relevance and visibility. If Americans do not return the support we received and actively engage in the fight against police brutality taking place outside of our borders, we risk achieving our goals for liberation through the hegemonic structures that actively harm Black people globally. To fight for an end to police brutality at home and ignore police brutality perpetuated abroad would be hypocritical.
At Harvard, students rallied around Black American students and led collective efforts to aid the struggle against police brutality and racism. Despite many on campus largely claiming to be against police violence, there has been little attention given to End SARS outside of the Harvard’s Nigerian Student Association and African Students Association. We are calling on Harvard’s police abolitionists, reformists, allies, and activists to both educate themselves so they can adjust their discourse to reflect Nigeria’s nuances and apply the same urgency for End SARS that we gave Black Lives Matter. There are ample resources online that outline ways to take action by donating, emailing the International Criminal Court, and elevating #EndSARS on your social media. Use them because Black lives around the world deserve just as much protection as Black lives in America. All Black Lives Matter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every once in a while, as I pass the enormous columns of Widener Library, I’m struck by the historical permanence of Harvard. Widener grants imposing physicality to the abstract idea that Harvard has been around for a long, long time.
And yet, it’s not terribly unusual for buildings to last a long time. Although the pandemic has kept most of us far from campus, we are still surrounded online by an even more impressive reminder of Harvard’s antiquity. Every day, as we Zoom with our proctors and work on our comps and text about punches, we participate in the great, multi-centennial linguistic tradition of Harvard slang.
“Comp” has been around so long (predating even the Crimson’s first issue) that no one knows whether it stands for competition or competency or something else entirely. The origin of “punching” is similarly shrouded.
The etymologies we do know often reveal interesting relationships between Harvard and other colleges. We can be proud, for example, of pioneering American use of “frosh” for freshmen. This is actually more Harvardian than you might think — it’s not a simple shortening of freshman but actually a pilfered Germanism. Young Germans would call the youngest university students Frosch, or “frogs.” In contrast, less cosmopolitan universities simply shortened “freshmen” to “freshies,” and we can all take some pride and relief from the fact that “frosh” has won out.
“Concentrations,” in contrast, represent a battle we seem to have lost, at least in the wider world. In 1900, all a Harvard student had to do to graduate was pass any 16 classes on offer. Former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell thought this inspired students to treat academics like “an inconvenient ritual,” occasionally rehearsed in between bouts of socializing. So, in response, he introduced the requirement of adopting a “department of major concentration.”
Now, a century later, awkward freshmen still lead with, “So what are you concentrating in?” And given the long list of once universal slang that has fallen quickly out of fashion—groovy, bogart, skinny, home fry,—the longevity of Harvard slang is just as arresting as its originality. The grind has not, in fact, stopped since the 1850s when the word was first used. We’ve already alluded to the long, shrouded histories of comp and punch.
As early as 1886, Harvard students were writing about “Harvard Slang.” One long-gone Crimson columnist described the transition from freshman affectation to unconscious upperclassman habit, and this goes some way toward explaining our slang’s longevity. Even if freshman think, as I did, that maintaining the distinction of a “concentration” is silly and mildly pretentious, it’s not worth wasting whatever minor social capital we have dying on that particular hill. By the time we are upperclassmen, unconscious habit forestalls any change. Furthermore, slang that is particular to elements of college life (or even specifically Harvard life) serves a more practical purpose than words like “groovy” or “funky” or “cool,” which all generally refer to the same idea.
In both these ways, institutional slang lasts far longer than most other slang. But the longevity of Harvard slang reveals something about how our institution works more broadly. We may take some pride that Harvard is sufficiently preeminent to maintain its idiosyncratic terminology (“concentration,” “punch” etc.) without regard for external pressures. We may feel some embarrassment at the pretension of doing so. But in remembering Harvard’s perhaps extraordinary resistance to external pressure, it’s important not to conflate that with our very ordinary relationship with internal pressure. There’s no reason to think that Harvard students are any more resistant to institutional conformity than any other group of college students.
In that context of slang, conformity is relatively harmless, but it can be much more damaging when it comes to Harvard’s more substantive traditions. To some degree, every institution needs the freshman-affectation-to-upperclassman-habituation pipeline, and it might seem odd to lament complacency in a student body that is constantly criticizing its University: on divestment, political complacency, mental health support, exclusivity, or final clubs.
But while the University has made progress on some of these fronts, on others that criticism has not manifested change. The reason is that most Harvard students are not activists — we pass from affectation through habituation to graduation. That’s not necessarily a problem: we can’t constantly question everything, liberal arts cliches be damned. We need some level of assimilation.
But each of us questioning just a little bit more, and acting on our doubts just a little more frequently, vastly increases the probability that we’ll be proud of the traditions we’ve preserved and proud of the ones we have not.

The Common Application’s most inane question is finally history.
No longer will students have to self-report high-school disciplinary infractions, including suspensions. And though it may seem small, that’s an important step, if only an early one, toward racial justice and equitable access in education.
The decision came after the Common App found that Black applicants reported disciplinary infractions at twice the rate of their peers and counteract the fact that many students with disciplinary records forgo the application process entirely.
The sad reality is that school disciplinary systems often have long-term and disproportionate consequences for those it punishes.
We commend the Common App for removing a question that would both dissuade students from applying to college and exacerbate the racial and socioeconomic disparities so apparent in the college application process. Though this change is a modest one, we hope that it is the beginning of vast changes to an educational system that works against poor and nonwhite students.
Our country’s high schools are over-policed and over-disciplined. These practices disproportionately affect poorer and non-white students. But change can’t just be about encouraging colleges to disregard this information or encouraging students with infractions to apply; it has to start in primary and secondary schools themselves.
There is little, if any, evidence to suggest that disciplinary actions, such as suspensions, work toward improving student behavior or the overall environment in schools. In fact, they often have negative consequences. As such, not only do racial disparities in those disciplinary processes need to be addressed, but the processes themselves need to be rethought and overhauled. School, like our criminal justice system as a whole, must move away from retributive forms of discipline, which tend to make offenders more likely to recommit infractions and are intrinsically cruel, to a rehabilitative system that treats transgressors fairly and empowers them to contribute positively to society.
The Common App’s decision to remove the question about former disciplinary infractions will not change how guidance counselors address infractions, nor will it change the broader issues with the application process. In fact, we are concerned that the shift will only displace the problem more thoroughly onto other actors. Won’t guidance counselors, in their recommendation letters and school reports, still have to report these infractions? How can we be sure individual institutions won’t add their own replacement questions?
At its best, this change lifts one small barrier to entry for students — removes that horrible feeling some students might have when they see a question they feel they cannot answer truthfully, that shames them out of a future they long for so powerfully. But in truth, it may only be a small symbolic gesture — the Common App’s acknowledgement of its complicity.
This is only the beginning of dismantling the problems with the college application process. The Common App’s decision will not change the underlying problem of unequal access to higher education, and it should not be lauded as if it does.

An individual broke into Cabot House early last Tuesday, though they did not appear to steal property or enter residents’ rooms, according to reports by Harvard officials.
Cabot House Resident Dean Meg Lockwood emailed students and staff affiliated with the House, which is located adjacent to the Radcliffe Quadrangle at 62 Linnaean St., notifying them of a recent unauthorized entry Monday, just under a week after the incident occurred.
Lockwood wrote that Harvard officials do not believe the suspect entered students’ rooms or stole from them.
“We are not aware of anything being taken or damaged, nor do we think the person entered any occupied student rooms,” she wrote. “Please let me know if you noticed anything or have any additional information to share.”
A Harvard University police officer took a report that morning of a “past unlawful entry into the building,” per the Oct. 13 HUPD crime log.
Lockwood wrote in her email that HUPD is “familiar with the individual in question.” The department’s spokesperson, Steven G. Catalano, declined to comment on the incident, citing HUPD’s longstanding policy of not commenting on ongoing investigations.
Catalano did not respond to questions regarding how HUPD patrols Harvard’s depopulated campuses. Only roughly 25 percent of College students are living in the dorms due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of the University’s graduate schools have also deferred in-person learning.
Two days before the Cabot House break in, a HUPD officer took a report of a stolen silver Apple MacBook Pro laptop valued at $1,000 from a room in Weld Hall in Harvard Yard, according to the crime log. The two incidents do not appear to be related.
Lockwood reminded Cabot residents to follow safety precautions in her email, including closing and locking their doors and not allowing strangers into the House. She also provided phone numbers for emergency resources, including on-call tutors, HUPD, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and Harvard University Health Services Urgent Care.

Harvard researchers successfully used a human heart-on-chip to demonstrate that endothelial extracellular vesicles — particles released from cells lining the surface of blood vessels — are able to keep cardiac cells viable both during and after oxygen deprivation due to a heart attack.
The results, published last week in Science Translational Medicine, indicate that EEVs have the capacity to both rescue cardiac tissues damaged by lack of oxygen and serve as a potential multitargeted therapy for such damage. The successful use of heart-on-chip technology may also signal an emerging replacement to animal studies commonly used in biological experiments.
The researchers were based out of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry Proteomics.
Moran Yadid, the first author on the paper, began work on the research as a SEAS postdoctoral fellow in Bioengineering and Applied Physics professor Kit Parker’s lab; she now works as a research associate at Tel Aviv University.
Yadid said in an interview that the first of the study’s two main components entailed establishing an in vitro model for studying diseases and conditions that can affect cardiac tissues.
“This model is based on a heart-on-chip technology that we developed in the lab,” Yadid said. “In this technology, we utilize tissue engineering approaches and biofabrication to build tissues on soft substrates that can be good substrates to grow cardiac cells.”
In these chips, the researchers integrated special sensors that enabled them to continuously monitor the contracting function of the cardiac tissue in the heart, according to Yadid.
Johan U. Lind — another author on the paper who researched in Parker’s lab and is now an assistant professor at the Technical University of Denmark — said he worked extensively with the technological development of the heart-on-chip.
“One of the things that I think is exciting is this fundamental idea that we can study human tissue in the laboratory, and that might be a shortcut to new therapies,” Lind said. “So rather than taking the long route, where we do animal studies that don’t turn out much to actually predict what we’re looking for, to go straight to what’s human, and then test something new.”
The second part of the study focused on using the technology to study extracellular vesicles secreted from endothelial cells. In that phase, the researchers replicated a model for ischemia reperfusion injury — oxygen-deprivation damage that can lead to cell death — on the heart-on-chips and examined the impact of the EEVs.
Usually, when heart tissues or muscular tissues are deprived of oxygen, they cannot produce mechanical contractions, according to Yadid. But with EEVs present, the research team observed cell contraction even in the absence of oxygen.
“We saw that when you add these vesicles to cardiac features, they can increase their maximum respiration capacity, so they can work harder. They can better withstand and survive stress,” Yadid said. “When we actually induce the injury, we saw a significant decrease in cellular death. The tissue was much more viable after the injury. We also saw that they kept their mechanical function.”
Bogdan Budnik, a co-author of the paper and principal scientist at the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry, brought his expertise on single-cell proteomics to the team to analyze the EEVs, which require an ultra-sensitive type of analysis due to the limited amount of the material.
“Now, in this particular case, it’s the heart damage area of biology. But I do believe that extra vesicles-type of analysis will be applied to a lot of areas of cancer,” Budnik said. “I think that would be the big next step for proteomics.”
For Yadid, the research has two overarching takeaways. First, while previous efforts to treat failing hearts have focused on using one molecule to target one process, the group’s findings on EEVs indicate a solution to target many processes related to heart failure at once. Second, heart-on-chip or general organ-on-chip technology may come to replace animal studies as a more accurate method of testing new treatments.
“When we tested the same treatment with a rodent chip, we obtained different results,” Yadid said. “It’s more relevant to use human in vitro models rather than animal in vitro models to test different diseases.”

LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, discussed the dangers and sources of voter suppression at a panel discussion hosted Monday by Harvard’s Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History.
At the event, Brown — whose organization encourages Black Americans to vote to enact social justice — spoke with moderator Jordan T. Camp of Columbia University and Harvard Professor of History Tiya A. Miles ’92 about the long struggle to ensure that Black Americans have full voting rights and are engaged in the political process.
Brown said her organization has lately been going to early voting sites across the country, particularly in the South, to make certain that Black voters can safely cast ballots in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and hours-long voting lines in certain counties.
Brown pointed to potential voter suppression in Georgia as an area of concern for her organization. According to a report released by the Georgia American Civil Liberties Union last month, the state of Georgia likely removed nearly 200,000 citizens from the state’s voter rolls without proper cause. According to Brown, the state needed a license to remove voters’ registrations due to address changes or other reasons.
“The challenge with that is that those 200,000 people, we’re not even certain, if they know that they were dropped from the list. And if they did not register before October the fifth, they will not be able to vote in this election cycle,” Brown said.
The discussion also touched on the increase in mail-in ballots this fall and its potential implications for discrimination in the voting process.
Camp cited an NPR report which found that 550,000 mail-in ballots have been rejected in the 2020 presidential primaries, significantly more than the number rejected in the 2016 general election.
“Needless to say, the 2020 election is a decisive one, which may well turn out to be one of the most significant in US history,” Camp said.
Brown also commended the high Black voter turnout so far, despite the various barriers her organization is working to combat.
“Black voters are so determined,” Brown said.
Many of the Black voters Brown has spoken to have emphasized that they do not intend to be prevented in their attempt to vote.
“I think we’re going to see a remarkable turnout,” Brown said. “I think we’re going to have some upset down ballot races as well this election cycle,”
In the midst of the pandemic, the Black Voters Matter Fund — which was founded in 2016 — has been forced to shift its organizing tactics. While the group normally engages in door-to-door canvassing, Brown said the group has recently been deploying food trucks to feed voters, as well as using caravans to encourage voters to turn out.
Brown highlighted the power of grassroots action in helping tackle the current challenges facing the United States.
“There's something very powerful when people rise up, when there’s energy and intention behind it.” Brown said. “That's how movements happen.”

Nearly 20 percent of Republican Harvard undergraduates reported in a September survey that they would vote for Democratic nominee Vice President Joseph R. Biden in his presidential race against incumbent U.S. President Donald J. Trump.
Harvard Republicans are more split than members of their party nationwide; 9 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters indicated they would support Biden, according to a Pew Research Center survey that concluded Oct. 5.
Still, 75 percent of Republican students indicated that they planned to vote for Trump. The Harvard Republican Club announced its endorsement of Trump's 2020 bid last month, reversing their historic 2016 decision to split from the Republican Party by refusing to support him.
The 877 undergraduates who filled out The Crimson’s 2020 College Survey revealed, however, that the student body overall leans heavily toward identifying as Democrats, as in past years.
A majority of Harvard undergraduates — 60.8 percent — indicated that they are affiliated with the Democratic party. Meanwhile, 12.6 percent wrote that they consider themselves Independents, 6.9 percent Republicans, and 1.5 percent Libertarians.
Of the 84.8 percent of students who plan to vote in November, 89.1 percent plan to vote for Biden and 7.9 percent intend to vote for Trump.
Just over 10 percent of respondents indicated that they were not eligible to vote, and only 1.2 percent of survey respondents reported that they had decided not to vote.
A student-initiated petition calling on University President Lawrence S. Bacow to designate Election Day as a University holiday to ensure affiliates have ample time to vote and engage in other civic activities had earned over 600 signatures as of Monday evening.
The Harvard Votes Challenge, a student-led Institute of Politics initiative, has spent much of the lead-up to the election aiming to achieve perfect voter turnout across the entire University. The Harvard Votes Challenge has partnered with Harvard’s athletics teams to promote voting; more than half of the teams have pledged to reach 100 percent turnout.
Of the respondents on Harvard’s varsity teams, 78.4 percent said they were planning to vote in the election, compared to 85.6 percent of non-athletes planning to vote..
Seventy-two percent of students indicated that they are very or somewhat liberal, while 16 percent reported that they are moderate, and 12 percent that they are somewhat or very conservative.
Of the students who self-identified as “not at all religious,” 83 percent indicated that they are very or somewhat liberal. Only 6 percent of non-religious students, meanwhile, indicated that they were somewhat or very conservative. Conversely, of the students who self-identified as “extremely religious,” 47.3 percent said they were somewhat or very conservative, compared to 31.6 percent who said they were somewhat or very liberal.
Last week, Harvard’s Faculty Council began preliminary talks about how to support students and faculty after the presidential election, after the 2016 election results left Harvard’s large liberal contingent distressed and apprehensive about how a Trump presidency would impact their lives.

Harvard Kennedy School professor Joseph E. Aldy discussed how policymakers can learn from past models to maximize the impact of current American energy legislation at a Monday webinar hosted by the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Kennedy School professor Robert N. Stavins moderated a discussion after Aldy’s presentation, entitled “Greening Economic Stimulus: Lessons from the 2009 Recovery Act.”
Aldy, who helped craft energy and economic policy during the Obama administration, emphasized the importance of drawing from past policies — such as the 2009 Recovery Act — given what he described as an ongoing deficit of new energy policy.
“The challenge we face today, though, is that we really haven’t seen any major energy legislation pass Congress and signed into law since 2009,” he said.
Aldy argued that the strengths and shortcomings of the 2009 Recovery Act can help inform future legislation. He specifically pointed to how the law facilitated a drastic increase in clean energy expenditure across the nation.
“We saw tremendous growth in renewable power. Wind power since 2008 has quadrupled. Solar power in the United States is 100 times the level of 2008,” he said.
Aldy also said certain flaws in the Recovery Act can serve as key lessons for the future. He identified non-essential subsidies, delayed implementation, and the withdrawal of non-federal partners as critical challenges.
“It’s really valuable if you’re able to crowd in additional resources from the private sector, or in some cases, crowd in cost-sharing from state and local governments,” Aldy said. “But it may be that your partners decide not to go forward with the project and then you don’t go forward with those investments.”
In a question-and-answer session following his presentation, Aldy compared the energy proposals put forward by Donald Trump and Joe Biden’s presidential campaigns. He argued that Trump has not proposed significant energy legislation while in office and that Biden seems relatively interested in promoting sustainable energy.
“When we spent about $100 billion, that was the largest energy bill ever, and now we’re talking about something that is an order of magnitude larger. So it’s potentially a really big spend that the Biden team has in mind,” Aldy said.
In an interview following the event, Stavins described how holding remote discussions due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has forced those in the Belfer Center’s Harvard Project on Climate Agreements — which coordinated the webinar series — to create novel ways of engaging with policy questions.
“We thought that the pandemic, requiring people in many cases to be remote and to be at home, actually provided an opportunity that we might not otherwise have to bring together a large number of people internationally who were interested in climate change and energy policy,” Stavins said. “And so that’s what we’ve done.”
Stavins also expressed his hope that audience members took away a more informed, nuanced understanding of American energy policy through the series.
“I hope that people will leave this session recognizing that here are some real opportunities, but also that it’s often more complex than it first appears,” he said.

Members of the Harvard Undergraduate Resource Efficiency Program have adapted their work to suit a virtual semester, pushing students to make sustainable choices and working to engage students on environmental issues before this fall’s elections.
For the fall semester, the group’s members — known as REPs — have focused on three categories of projects: civic engagement, energy usage awareness, and sustainability grants.
“We have two main agendas this semester,” said Dannie C. Bell ’24, one of four REPs assigned to Harvard Yard. “So that would be civic engagement and energy.”
Unlike in previous semesters, the group has also focused on political engagement.
Ella M. Bradford ’24 said promoting voting in the election dovetails with REP’s mission.
“Representing [your voice] in politics, and making sure people are turning out and they're voting is really, really important," Bradford said.
Aside from election-related efforts, Bradford has also worked with Harvard's Office of Sustainability to publish a “Harvard at Home” guide, with information ranging from how to compost to where to buy reusable masks.
“This applies to people on and off campus,” Bell said. “People in dorms don’t really get the summary of their energy usage at the end of the month along with their bills, but this might be a new experience for some people who are staying in an apartment.”
Despite those new projects, Bradford said REP has faced challenges communicating with a remote freshman class.
“It's very hard to connect to the first-year class as a whole because there's so many of us, we're overly spaced out, and there's no one email list that we can just send to,” Bradford said.
Even as the pandemic exacerbated communication barriers between students, REP has encouraged students to pursue projects related to more responsible and efficient energy usage by offering sustainability grants.
DaLoria L. Boone ’22, an Adams House REP, wrote in an emailed statement that in addition to providing grants, the group has pushed students to be more independent and creative in their eco-conscious messages to peers.
"We still are offering sustainability grants for students to apply for," Boone said. "We have also been given some freedom in this uncertain time to really go out and try to make it the best program we can by really being creative."
Boone herself has had to exercise some of that creativity, reaching out to her House Administrators to create a sustainability webpage for Adams. She said she wanted to avoid overwhelming students studying at home with yet more emails.
"I personally took this idea and chose to ask my House Administrator, could I get a page on the Adams House website to provide students with important resources without overwhelming people by constantly sending out emails," Boone wrote.
In addition to grants, emails, and political efforts, the group has invited a series of guest speakers to talk about issues ranging from climate policy in government to economic reform.
“[Sustainability] is tough right now, so don't be too hard on yourself,” Bell said. “It can be a long road. And that's okay.”

University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that Harvard “strenuously opposes” a proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to limit the length of stay permitted on international student visas.
“This is an inappropriate intrusion into academic matters, and it is unwarranted,” Bacow wrote in a letter to DHS Acting Regulatory Unit Chief Sharon Hageman on Friday.
Currently, visas are valid for the duration of time a student is enrolled in an accredited institution. If the new rule is enacted, it will set fixed four year terms for international student visas, after which students must apply for a new visa or a two year extension.
The proposal, announced in the Federal Register on Sept. 25, is open for feedback until Oct. 26. DHS has already received over 20,000 comments — though it is not guaranteed to change the final rule.
In his letter, Bacow wrote that just 86 percent of undergraduates receive their degrees within 4 years, while most graduate and professional-level degree programs consist of “five to seven years of advanced coursework and independent scholarship or training.”
As a result, the University “conservatively” estimates that the four year term limit would affect more than 1,300 Ph.D. candidates and 140 doctoral candidates at Harvard, per Bacow.
“By casting a wide net and arbitrarily bounding international students and scholars, the proposed rule would create negative and cascading consequences for US research, scholarship, and training; weaken our national recovery and future competitiveness; and undermine our national response to global challenges in science, security, and public health,” Bacow wrote.
The proposed rule further limits international students from certain countries — those listed as state sponsors of terrorism or those with student visa overstay rates exceeding 10 percent — to terms of just two years.
Bacow wrote that overstay rates do not “adequately justify this overbroad and discriminatory treatment based on national origin,” which he estimated will impact more than 300 students and scholars at Harvard.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.
The letter from Bacow is the latest in a series of critiques of the proposed change from administrators at the University. In an interview last week, Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott said that “the proposed notice seeks to fix a problem that doesn't exist.”
DHS Senior Official Kenneth T. Cuccinelli justified the proposed change as “critical in improving program oversight mechanisms, preventing foreign adversaries from exploiting the country’s education environment” in a press release last month.
The Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers also circulated a petition that called on Harvard’s International Office to take a more aggressive approach in addressing the proposed rule.
On Oct. 9, Harvard administrators facilitated a meeting between international students and Bradley E. Abruzzi, a staff attorney from the Office of General Counsel. Abruzzi could not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Aayush Khadka, an organizer with the HGSU-UAW, said that the meeting was helpful, despite uncertainty surrounding the final text of the proposed rule change.
“The HIO information session was quite helpful,” Khadka wrote in a message to The Crimson. “The panelists very clearly explained the possible ramifications of the rule and outlined the steps that Harvard is taking to ensure that the rule is not finalized — at least in its current form.”
Khadka is from Nepal, one of the countries listed under the proposed ruling as having a visa overstay rate of greater than 10 percent.
In his letter Friday, Bacow concluded that the rule would deter future international students from coming to live, work, and study in the United States, adding that it would be an intellectual and economic loss for the nation.
“We need well-crafted, forward-looking immigration and visa policies to help win back international students and scholars and to avoid lasting damage to our national competitiveness, security, and prosperity,” Bacow wrote. “To remedy this indifference to the many contributions that international students and scholars make to this nation, I join with the leaders of science, medicine, and industry in urging you to immediately withdraw this unnecessary and injurious proposal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge held a meeting Monday to discuss policy orders about the city budget and bike safety, as well as update residents on measures taken to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
The City Council adopted a motion to instruct the Finance Department to provide statistics regarding the allocation of resources to city departments in order to address concerns of uneven distribution of resources in the 2022 Fiscal Year Budget.
The motion — which was voted on 9-0 — would require the Finance Department to provide an amount and percentage of money used by every department to address racial and economic equity.
Councilor E. Denise Simmons, a co-sponsor of the motion, said the city’s budget allocation “is very hard to quantify, let alone qualify,” making it difficult for citizens to know how financial resources are allocated.
“By bringing this all together in one segment, we as a city can know, are we, to use a cliché, putting our money where our mouth is?” Simmons said. “Are we really standing up around social equity? What departments might be lagging behind?”
The City Council also adopted a motion to improve bike and pedestrian safety in Harvard Square by providing planting strips along bike lanes in place of painted buffer zones.
Councilor Dennis J. Carlone described the current bike separations as belonging “in a trucking depot, not on major city streets.”
“Where we now have painted lines on the street, you put planters in, which have 6-inch curbs, which better protect bikers,” Carlone said. “And we also have areas on the asphalt where we’re going from two lanes to one lane that are just painted out — that should be planted too. We want to expand our vegitative areas throughout the city.”
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale also provided updates on measures taken by the city to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, such as its decision to cancel all city-sponsored Halloween events.
“Public celebrations like Halloween are an important part of our community and it is a difficult decision for us to recommend, but it's the right decision to protect the wellbeing of our residents,” he said. “This recommendation is in line with the conservative approach that we have been taking in our public health strategies.”
“I believe this approach has played a significant role in Cambridge rating still as a green community,” he added.
Councilor Marc C. McGovern raised concerns about a video he said he had watched that depicted “30 college-age people out in front of a restaurant — no social distancing, no masks.”
“I think we need to recommit to making sure that people understand — I don’t know if we need new signage, I don’t know if we need to get more ambassadors out there,” he said. “I can’t say whether or not those folks were Harvard students per se — they were college-aged in Harvard Square, but certainly making sure we’re talking to the universities as well.”
Coronavirus cases remain low among Harvard undergraduates living on campus, according to University data. The school recently implemented a pilot that allows for students living off campus to receive COVID testing weekly.
Simmons said she is concerned about the relatively high number of cases of COVID-19 still prevalent in minority communities in Cambridge.
“I know that we're very pleased about our numbers as it pertains to overall numbers — as it pertains to how we look citywide — but our numbers are still very high in the Black and Brown community,” she said. “I'm just looking for everyone's best thoughts on how we can be more effective, reaching into this very highly hard hit part of our community.”
As of Monday afternoon, the rate of COVID-19 cases among Black Cambridge residents was 232 per 10,000 residents — compared to 91 cases among 10,000 white Cambridge residents.
Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob updated the City Council on efforts to prepare for flu season and prevent “the perfect storm between COVID symptoms and flu symptoms.”
“We know that we need to prepare for flu season which is why we've amplified our flu campaign this year. We're doing 10 times as many flu shots to mitigate the impact that could happen in area hospitals,” he said. “We remain cautious, we stay the course, we continue doing what we’ve done for the last six or eight months.”
“Recognizing that what we’re seeing now is, as shared by the recent reports and the patterns of what we’re seeing in neighboring cities and towns, winter’s coming,” Jacob added. “And I don't mean Game of Thrones, I'm just saying that this is really what we're preparing for and we need to continue to stay the course and so we'll adjust as needed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow discussed the value of incremental change to address complex issues in a virtual forum at the Institute of Politics Monday.
In a talk on the “Leadership Playbook,” Bacow said that advocates calling for change often lack an understanding of the limitations leaders face.
“I always say it's very easy to be an advocate if you never have to take responsibility for a decision,” he said. “We've all been in positions where we've had people shouting at us, saying 'just do this, just do this,' never understanding the constraints under which leaders operate, never understanding how it's necessary to build sustainable coalitions to bring about meaningful change.”
Bacow — who spoke alongside Havard Corporation Fellow David M. Rubenstein — said leaders must take into account a range of perspectives, not just those espoused by vocal advocates.
“There's a time and a place for advocacy, but also leadership sometimes involves helping people to understand that problems are sometimes more complicated than they may be perceived by those who don't have responsibility for dealing with a broad swath of society or an organization, and who only are responsible to those who think like them,” he said.
This is not the first time Bacow has addressed the role of activism on a college campus.
In April 2019, at another talk at the Institute of Politics, Bacow clashed with divestment activists who interrupted the event to protest the University’s refusal to divest from fossil fuels and companies tied to the prison industry.
In a terse address to protestors, Bacow told them that he responds to “reason” not “demands” — a sentiment he expressed to prison divestment organizers earlier that year.
“You’re not being helpful to your cause and I suspect you’re also not gaining many friends or many allies in the audience by virtue in the way in which you choose to express your point of view,” he said at the time.
In the conversation on Monday, Rubenstein also said he thinks “incremental change” is the best strategy to enact desired reforms.
“The reason that people make change in an incremental way is that, historically, it’s easier to get things done if it’s incremental,” he said. “Most humans don't like change. Most people like what they have and what they're doing, and so getting them to change is not that easy. So I think it's going to be harder and harder to make revolutionary changes.”
In response, Wendy R. Sherman — the director of the Center for Public Leadership who moderated the discussion — asked Rubenstein how leaders can “break through that extraordinary resistance” and prevent stagnation.
“From time to time, extraordinary events come along,” he said, naming Sept. 11, 2001 and the Civil War as examples.
“You need extraordinary people who are prepared to take advantage of this extraordinary situation and then lead with great revolutionary changes, as Lincoln did with the Emancipation Proclamation,” Rubenstein explained. “That's when you have to make big changes, when the country is more willing to listen to something because they're afraid.”
Bacow noted that Abraham Lincoln, too, was criticized by abolitionists for not acting on the issue of slavery sooner.
“But Lincoln recognized that he needed to bring people along and to create a coalition which could survive and to prepare the country for change,” Bacow said.
He agreed with Rubenstein that gradual change is the norm, while “dramatic change” is often only prompted by a specific historical moment.
“Incrementalism will always be with us,” Bacow said. “That's not to say that there will not be times in history in which we will see more dramatic change that occurs, but that’s usually because of disequilibrium, which has been often imposed by some exogenous shock to the system.”

Don’t you miss the rush of adrenaline that kicks in while entering a jam-packed Science Center Hall B on midterm day? There’s nothing like the students rushing in from both sides, the papers flying, and trying desperately to secure a sought-after aisle seat. Freshmen, you’ll have to take our word for it — midterms in person were truly an experience. Though we aren’t able to take midterms physically in those beloved Science Center rooms this term, there are definitely some ways to succeed in making your at-home study space a “mini” lecture hall, aka a space where you can actually take a midterm without worrying that your little sibling will barge in asking you for help.
Make a “Stay Out” Sign
Grab markers, crayons, and drawing paper left over from your elementary school stash of school supplies, and make a sign on your door for when you’re taking a midterm. Feel free to make the sign pretty (maybe even sparkly!) and write in big, bold letters: “MIDTERM IN SESSION.” Hopefully, your family/roommates/anyone else will get the memo that you are taking a midterm and that it’s not the best time for an interruption.
If you are taking midterms in a space that you share with roommates or family members, let others know in advance when your exams are so they can plan to minimize any sounds or disruptions. Communication is most definitely key. If, however, you’re really unable to find a quiet space, consider purchasing some ear plugs or playing white noise to cancel out the surrounding noise, and reach out to your professor to see if any accommodations will be possible.
Get Organized
Next, make sure that your new “Remote Science Center Hall B” is actually fit for taking a midterm. Remove distractions, like that plate of lunch that’s been sitting on your desk since yesterday. Take out any materials that you need for the exam (paper, pencils, pens, calculator, etc.) and make sure that you have a clock nearby to check timing.
Is your exam open-note? If so, then make sure you have easy access to any and all notes that could possibly help. The easier it is to access these materials, the less time you’ll waste searching for that specific bullet point in those lecture slides. For many, open-notes is actually overwhelming because there are just SO MANY NOTES. Consider consolidating only the most important parts of your notes so that you don’t spread those precious exam minutes searching through Canvas folder after Canvas folder.
Practice Like It’s the Real Thing
As some pre-exam prep, if the course offers practice midterms, consider taking these as if they were real. Follow steps 1-4 if you can, try to resist skipping straight to the answer key the moment you see a question you don’t know the answer to, and time yourself as you take the practice exam. Doing this will allow you to gauge how much time you should spend on each section.
Most importantly, remember that this midterm is JUST a midterm. It’s important to be kind to yourself. Keep reminding yourself that you’re awesome and amazing, and you’re doing your best during a very unusual semester. Once you’ve completed the midterm, consider getting some fresh air or treating yourself with something nice. You did it!
