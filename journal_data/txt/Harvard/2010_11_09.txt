Nov. 12-14, 8 p.m. & Nov. 18-20,

In Jean Genet’s “The Balcony,” sex is theater and power is a performance. Set in a brothel, the play focuses on three men whose power fetishes lead them to assume the roles of a Bishop, a Judge, and a General. Outside the lavish brothel, a brutal revolution rages in the streets. On the night on which the play is set, the revolution takes a terrible turn, and those inside the brothel must take action or die. The Bishop, Judge, and General, acting out the power positions they have assumed, stop the revolution by appealing to the people.
“The Balcony examines how power in society is essentially a theatrical thing. It isn’t something that is inherent to anyone… It’s something that you perform,” director Matthew C. Stone ’11, a Crimson arts writer, says.
According to Stone, this production of “The Balcony” has strayed away from the heavy-handed theatricality of the original script.  “We’ve tried to find a lot of ways to ground the show,” he says.
“We really wanted to try to emphasize the universality [of the play’s subject matter] and emphasize the human aspects of these characters and make them much more approachable to the audience,” co-executive producer Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 adds.
Maria-Ilinca Radulian ’11, who plays Irma, the brothel’s mistress, lived through the 1989 revolution in Romania. Over the course of the play, Irma’s tough exterior is cracked and her inner vulnerability exposed.
“I understand how an individual destiny can be swept up in this larger thing and you’re at the will of forces that are beyond yourself,” Radulian says. “It doesn’t matter how tough you are.”

Nov. 11-14, 17-20, 7:30 p.m. & Nov. 14,
2:30 p.m. in the Loeb Ex
Directed by Abigail F. Schoenberg ’12
Produced by Jacqueline P. Palumbo ’11
There are few things in life that everyone shares, but death is on top of the list of all that is inevitable. In Abigail F. Schoenberg’s ’12 directorial debut, she has chosen to meditate on this idea with the production “Death and the King’s Horseman” by Wole Soyinka.
The play is set in colonial Nigeria where, following the dictates of Yoruban culture, the King’s Horseman, Elesin, (Yi Jun Tan ’13) must commit ritual suicide 30 days after the death of the king to follow him into the afterlife. And so “Death and the King’s Horseman” begins on the dawn of that fateful day when Elesin must battle against his opposing desires to maintain his honor by performing the ritual or abandon his heritage by pursuing a passionate love of life.
Rather than emphasize the colonial dichotomy between Africans and Europeans in which the play is historically situated, Schoenberg and producer Jacqueline P. Palumbo ’11 decided on colorblind casting to reflect the universality of the script’s themes.
“These issues of figuring out who you are, what your culture is, what your life means are relevant to everyone,” Palumbo says.
Likewise, Schoenberg adds that even though this interpretation of Soyinka’s work does not stay completely faithful to the original text, her goal is for the audience to be transported to a place where they can reflect on the subjective nature of life and death regardless of one’s race.
“I think [Soyinka] would be satisfied with how we are… trying to create a space for the concept of transmission, and that any color person in the audience would be able to get it,” she says.

Contemporary Pop artist Romero Britto creates bold artwork characterized by vibrant colors, solid lines, and creative patterning. While he grew up developing his aesthetic on scraps of paper in his hometown of Recife, Brazil, his work has now since been showcased in the Louvre, Hyde Park, and the JFK Airport.
Most recently, Britto visited law professor Daniel Shapiro’s freshman seminar, “Negotiation and Conflict Management: Dealing with Emotions and Identity,” and collaborated with the students on artistic interpretations of the themes they had studied and researched throughout the semester.
The Harvard Crimson: Would you mind telling me a little about yourself as an artist? What is it that you seek to accomplish with your work?
Romero Britto: I hope what I’m doing is producing images of hope and peace and inspiration for people to wake up in the morning… It’s all about inspiration. I’m here to share my policy about life with other people.
THC: What is the message that you seek to convey through your art?
RB: I try to spread the message of happiness—you know, good things that we see in life. A lot of times, artists see things that are not so great. We’re in a time that technology and information is so out there, so prevalent in any way we turn. I want to go back to the art of inspiration.
TCH: Recently, you visited Professor Daniel Shapiro’s Freshman Seminar on conflict management. Would you tell me a little about what you did with the students in class? What motivated you to come to Harvard and work with these students?
RB: I definitely want to have my art as close to education as possible. When you have education and knowledge you are able to make much better decisions in your life and appreciate more the other side. With education, more people know about how you can deal with people and how you can resolve things. [In the class,] the students talked to me about how they envision a picture. Then I visualize that in words, what they were telling me, and I put it on a canvas. It was pretty amazing to me, and, they told me, for them, as well. For me as an artist to see those young brains working so well together, it was a beautiful day together.
THC: My assumption is that this was very different from what you do in your daily work. Here the students were presenting you with themes they researched and artistic ideas they created, and you had to translate that onto the canvas on the spot. What was it like to create art with other people’s ideas and so immediately?
RB: It was very unique. Most of the time I’m always in control. In the same time it was an opportunity for me to share the canvas, share the space. It was different, something I enjoyed and shared and liked, as well. Sharing power, sharing control, sharing your role with people. At the same time I know where they stand, they know where I stand, and we appreciate each other. I’m an artist, they’re students, and they have a unique vision of the future.
THC: The premise of the course is that, as Professor Shapiro outlines on the course website, “traditional approaches to conflict resolution are faltering –at a great cost to human life and regional and global economies.” How do you feel the artistic approach that you and the students pursued addressed that concern?
RB: We need to know more about the people, we need to appreciate them. When people see each other as humans, when they try to work together, it makes such a difference. Once they start seeing people as people, it makes such a difference. When we don’t have dialogue we feel “Oh my God, there’s nothing we can do.”
THC: Can art take the place of that lost dialogue?
RB: It could. With art and sports people feel more free. It’s like the universal language, we need to create the universal language. People can have the dialogue and stop and think. I think it could be a different way of communication.
THC: What did you take away from this experience? Do you see it influencing your art in the future? Will you try to do something like this project again?
RB: I would love to be able to have my art as an instrument to bring people together. I love that I had the opportunity to do that. The power of the art—images, shapes, and color can bring people to a whole different world. Art in general can be used to bring people together as a language of love.

The work of Henry James is not unfamiliar territory for Cynthia Ozick. She composed her master’s thesis on the subject of James, and the title story in her collection “Dictation” deals with the rivalry between James and Conrad. Her latest novel, “Foreign Bodies,” is another tribute to the turn-of-the-century writer; Ozick attempts an adaptation of one his later novels, “The Ambassadors.” Setting it in postwar Paris in 1952, Ozick describes her retelling in relationship to James’s work as “a photographic negative, in which the plot is the same but the meaning is reversed.”
“The Ambassadors” is the narrative of the middle-aged Lambert Strether, sent to Paris by his tyrannical fiancée to extricate her son from a relationship with a French woman of whom she does not approve. “Foreign Bodies” tells the similar tale of Bea Nightingale, who travels to Paris at the behest of her estranged brother, Marvin, to retrieve his wayward son, Julian. While skillfully imitating his literary style, Ozick uses James’s framework to introduce a set of ideas that are entirely her own. The clash between Europe and America here is not a conflict between lax French morality and Puritanical New England values, but between the haunting plight of the Jewish people in postwar Europe and the American urge to erase the past and start afresh. And where James’s Strether is reluctant in his middle age, despite many temptations, to change the course of his life, Ozick’s Bea seeks to do exactly that.
Even when Ozick departs from James’s original plot, her writing is full of Jamesian allusions. At one point, Bea asks her niece, Iris, “Why all this ambassadorial traffic?”—referencing the title of Ozick’s source novel. Elsewhere Iris refers to an American girl who has married a real-life Italian prince, in a pairing of characters that might be familiar to readers of James’s “Roderick Hudson” and “The Princess Casamassima.”
The Paris that Ozick so eloquently describes is, however, far removed from the glittering capital of culture that appears in so much of James’s work. Ozick’s Paris is alluring, to be sure; her young expatriates marvel at the architectural majesty of the city: “Great public statues pitted by age, spires, ancient bridges over ancient rivers.” They are also intrigued by the Parisian literary world; Julian makes references to “Gertrude and Alice” and also briefly seeks the approval of George Plimpton and the literati at the emerging Paris Review.
But Julian and Iris are drawn not only to the high culture of the French city, but more generally to the European continent, which Iris views as “this incandescent parcel of earth and its beckoning cities, unknown, sealed, glowing, never to be ventured.” The woman with whom Julian involves himself is a Jewish-Romanian refugee, one of many such émigrés who treat Paris as a way station, a mere stop on a journey to a more definite escape from their tortured past. During his stay in Paris, Julian gravitates more towards the grieving souls populating the Marais than the Parisian cultural elite. Although Julian and Iris are far from likeable characters—they are too weak and selfish to provoke any real sympathy—Ozick deftly illustrates their curiosity about a cultural past that has been hidden from them.
As Ozick sketches out the complicated dynamics of the Nachtigall (or Nightingale) family, she adeptly portrays the conflict between an older generation ready to escape the trials of anti-Semitism and a younger generation that rebels by returning to the culture their parents renounced. It is, after all, his son’s romance with Judaism that is especially threatening to Julian’s father. Marvin Nachtigall married out of the Jewish faith, with the conscious intent of renouncing his heritage: “[I]t wasn’t supposed to get into the next generation, and it never did, I stopped it right from the start,” he tells his sister. Even Bea, who has not repudiated her heritage with the same fervor that her brother has, nevertheless changes her name from the Yiddish “Nachtigall” to the anglicized “Nightingale,” claiming that she does so only to make it easier for her high school students to pronounce. 
Marvin’s character, however, often strays into the realm of caricature, detracting somewhat from the nuances of the familial conflicts that Ozick depicts. He comes across as something of a buffoon; at one point he retorts in a letter to Bea, “Kierkeguard, what’s that? Sounds like a deodorant, which is to say that the whole thing smells as far as I’m concerned.” Blustering and raging against his sister even as he looks to her for help, Marvin shows neither brotherly affection nor any remorse for his maltreatment of Bea. Because it is his demand that his son return home which sets the narrative in motion, the one-dimensionality of Marvin’s character is a serious flaw in a work that is otherwise very meticulously constructed.
The epigraph for Ozick’s novel is, unsurprisingly, a quote from James’s “The Ambassadors:” “But there are two quite distinct things—given the wonderful place he’s in—that may have happened to him. One is that he may have got brutalized. The other is that he may have got refined.” Although Ozick does not quite leave enough room in her novel for the kind of complex character development for which James is so well known, she cleverly illustrates a set of personalities who are all struggling to choose between the old word and the new world, to reconcile their personal desires with those of their family, and to tread on the right side of this line between brutalization and refinement.

In Thomas McGuane’s tenth novel, “Driving on the Rim,” a friend of the narrator suggests that he “get some advice about operating on a somewhat different plane. Neither I nor anyone else in town can figure out where the hell you’re coming from.”  Needless to say, the narrator does not quite understand what his friend means. Dr. Irving Berlin “Berl” Pickett’s life is changed when he is accused of the negligent homicide of a former lover. Spurred in large part by this event, Berl plunges into a search to discover and understand himself and the meaning of his life, a meditative journey in large part focused on the exploration of formative events from his earlier years. Novels propelled by emotionally incompetent or unreliable narrators often depend in large part on a story arc that gradually leads to either the protagonist’s self-actualization or the reader’s comprehension of the discrepancy between the narrator’s lens and reality. Though full of comically astute social observations and lyrical depictions of the Montana landscape, the novel fails to develop Berl’s meditations enough to fully illuminate its idiosyncratic protagonist and the darkly humorous aspects of small-town Montana life.
Berl was raised by zealous Pentacostalist parents with a tendency to embark on obscure and ill-fated professional endeavors like a rug-shampooing business. Berl’s first sexual experiences occurred as an early teenager, with his aunt. With a childhood like this, it’s easy to understand why, upon reaching adulthood, Berl might have difficulties functioning in his community. The gradual narrative revelation of Berl’s social awkwardness is humorous and initially satisfying. While having drinks with Tessa Larinov, Berl’s lover-to-be, his idea of an appropriate icebreaking question involves asking her, “When people use the expression ‘rest in peace’ do you think they have some basis for saying it, or is it just wishful thinking?” When examining the incident in retrospect, Berl acknowledges that he shouldn’t have thought Tessa would have an answer to this question, but this is the extent of his understanding of the social ineptitude of his remarks.
The novel shifts constantly between Berl’s reflections on his earlier years and his middle-aged struggles with his career, his relationships with women, and the aftermath of the accusation. This latter storyline is compelling but unfortunately receives less emphasis than Berl’s recollection of his young adult life, and the way it is interspersed with meditations on the past weakens its impact. Berl’s younger years certainly contributed to his development as a man and a doctor, but his memories of his youth often feel repetitive and do not dig deep enough to enhance the story. McGuane spends a great deal of time discussing Berl’s father’s obsession with his experiences in the Second World War. Each time he reflects upon these stories, however, he only adds a few new details, making the novel feel somewhat disjointed. Certain moments from Berl’s adolescence are particularly strong, however, and illustrate McGuane’s skillful use of dark humor, such as Berl’s description of his sexual awakening at the hands of his aunt Silbie. In reference to Berl’s parents discovery of the two naked together and their understandable rage at Silbie, Berl reflects, “It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman in possession of a trailer has a gun, and Silbie pulled hers on Mom and Dad.”
Berl often comments on his tendency to slip into a dissociated emotional state, and the novel in some ways recreates this sensation. The story jumps back and forth in a non-linear manner and the transitions between passages are often very abrupt. This narrative choice reflects Berl’s meditative process—outside of fiction, reflections rarely take place in a chronological form—and although this does allow for a deeper immersion within Berl’s mind, it often results in confusion about the sequence of events.
Berl is, in fact, an intriguing and complex character, whose social ineptitude is often driven by compassion and goodwill—or by uncontrollable and regressive sexual desire. Knowing that much of Berl’s character was determined by his childhood and young adulthood, there are certain details from Berl’s earlier years that would benefit from greater development. Although Berl’s parents’ stories are discussed in depth, Berl’s own experiences, whether with early girlfriends or in medical school, are often only described superficially.
McGuane is at his best not in his construction of character and plot but in his descriptions of nature and the Montana landscape, which are particularly strong throughout the novel. McGuane lives on a ranch in McLeod, Montana, and at the start of the novel, he provides a disclaimer saying, “The people and places of this book, inspired to some extent by forty years living in Montana, do not exist in reality or even entirely in familiarity.” Fortunately, McGuane masterfully utilizes his experience with the landscape of Montana to illustrate an environment of beauty, immensity, and complexity. By inserting Berl into this world, McGuane succeeds in creating a compelling setting and premise, albeit one that could have benefitted from a stronger and less disjointed plot. Reflecting on his life, Berl says, “I do abide in the conviction that I’ve come a long way, and lately I’ve wondered how this all happened.” The novel might have benefited from more time spent exploring exactly that.

The double bass doesn’t usually get the solos in jazz, but it was this instrument that took center stage during the concert “Walking the Bass Line: A Tribute to Milt Hinton,” the culminating performance of a three-day event honoring the great musician and photographer.
Called the “dean of jazz bass players” by the New York Times, Hinton was one of the most prolific and respected bassists in jazz.
The tribute, which ran from November 4-6 and was co-produced by the Harvard Jazz Bands and the Office for the Arts, also included a conversation with Grammy Award-winning bassist and guest artist Cecil McBee, an exhibit of Hinton’s personal photography, and a screening of the documentary  “Keeping the Time: The Life, Music and Photographs of Milt Hinton.”
Director of the Harvard University Band Thomas G. Everett, who has been instrumental in bringing professional jazz musicians to Harvard since the early 1980s to encourage collaboration between professional musicians and students, says that recognition for the late Hinton is long overdue. Since the role of the bass in jazz is usually to hold down the beat, or in the words of McBee “to make it swing,” its presence is vital but not showy. Despite the bass’s predominantly supporting position during performances, Everett says that Hinton has made an invaluable contribution to the genre.
“Whatever ensemble or band Milt Hinton played with, he brought something special to it without drawing attention to himself,” he says.
Everett adds that Hinton, also known as the Judge, was considered a musician’s musician.
“He would very modestly say that his job was just to make other people sound better, though I think he did more than that,” he says. Some of the famous musicians he collaborated with included jazz greats such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington.
In addition to his storied musical repertoire, Hinton was also a talented amateur photographer, capturing on film the very jazz musicians with whom he played. On display at the Holyoke Center through December 8, his photography expresses a fluid blend of his hobby and musical profession.
In the 60 years of his career, he took over 60,000 candid photographs of musician friends on the road and in the recording studio.
Guest of honor McBee’s own musical career builds on top of Hinton’s legacy. While they represent different eras in jazz, McBee only has praise for Hinton’s musical ability. “Out of many tonalities, [a bassist is] responsible for choosing the perfect jewel. Milt Hinton was absolutely genius at that. His choices of tone were all select jewels.”
In addition to participating in the tribute’s public events, McBee, who is an accomplished composer and teacher as well as a renowned performer, was also on hand to personally teach and rehearse with the student musicians of the Harvard Jazz Bands.
Citing one of the reasons why he wanted to bring McBee to campus to interact with undergraduates, Everett says, “Cecil is a master teacher.”
McBee worked closely with members of the band in the days leading up to the concert. At rehearsals, the group played from pages of music handwritten by McBee. “Cecil has been a catalyst for us,” says Alex J. Rezzo ’11, a tenor saxophonist and co-manager of the band.
“When he plays the bass, it’s just a completely different feeling,” Rezzo says.
Apropos of the concert’s name, Saturday evening’s “Walking the Bass Line” prominently featured the bass. The program included both renditions of well-known recordings by Hinton and McBee’s original compositions.
McBee began the second half of the concert with a solo improvisation and then played several songs with the students of the band. The evening ended with a performance of McBee’s piece “U Phoria” in an arrangement that was especially commissioned for the night.
Though jazz may not be the most popular musical genre blasting on campus, the three days of event have shown that jazz has a place at Harvard. As McBee says, “Music performed well will touch souls of all ages.”

If “Ruddigore, or the Witch’s Curse” is concerned with, above all, what one ought to do in certain situations, let it be made clear that one ought not to persecute witches. This lesser known Gilbert and Sullivan operetta—presented by the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players at the Agassiz Theatre through November 14—recounts the tale of the cursed line of the baronets of Ruddigore, who are plagued by a witch’s spell. The production, directed by Crimson arts comper Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, navigates a very fine line between amusement and tedium, landing more often on the former.
The witch’s curse demands that the baronets commit one heinous crime every day or suffer a horribly slow and painful death. More specifically, the story of “Ruddigore” focuses on one “bad baronet” who flees his fate, taking on a new identity as the strapping farmer Robin Oakapple (Jonathan K. Stevens ’14). Ultimately, Robin must assume his noble title, Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd, and find some way to thwart his family’s curse.
With a corps of professional bridesmaids, a tap-dancing sailor, and a team of vivified portrait paintings, “Ruddigore” certainly has enough oddity to entertain. Comical secondary characters like Dame Hannah (Amelia H. Ross ’14), Old Adam Goodheart (Eli E. Kahn ’13), and Mad Margaret (Ashley N. Kaupert ’12) provide oft needed comic relief when the plot thickens into an opaque soup. If you can keep track of who’s marrying whom and why, you should receive some sort of prize from the Players.
“Ruddigore” also contains several musical gems that ground the production from floating into oblivion. “I Know a Youth” is a lovely duet performed by Robin and Rose Maybud (Liv A. Redpath ’14), in which the characters confess their love for one another while pretending to refer to some other friend. The finale of the first act exhibits a serious case of “musical A.D.D.” (as noted by Music Director David R. Sawicki ’12 in his program notes), that at its finest moments, includes several sections of ensemble a cappella. In these passages of layered vocal interplay, the cast surely outshines its orchestra. The second act includes several successfully ghoulish numbers by the ghosts of baronets past (who spring to life from a portrait gallery) and the show-stopping patter trio, “My Eyes are Fully Open.”
Unfortunately, the standout performances from “Ruddigore” come from the secondary characters. While Stevens and Redpath are both somewhat endearing, they lack real chemistry onstage, making their duets awkward. Ross and Eric Padilla ’14 (as Sir Despard Murgatroyd) are clearly the vocal standouts. Caked in dark purple lipstick and eye shadow, Ross’s sardonic glare proves a welcome contrast to the hyper-sprightly Rose and her bridesmaids. As Dame Hannah, her smooth, husky voice easily fills Agassiz Theatre with a balanced vibrato. Padilla’s crooning is morbid in act one, then charming in act two, his characteristic stare both icy and silly.
Of course every production has its highs and lows, and the orchestra for “Ruddigore” was largely responsible for the latter. A perpetually out-of-tune string section marred otherwise enjoyable songs. A shaky brass section surely did not help to ease that pain. And while the cast displays commendable vocal talent, the acting is often awkward, over-the-top, or just bizarre (e.g. the gaggle of ghost baronets who emerge from portraits in the second act). Several technical defects threatened to throw off the cast, although Kaupert (as Mad Margaret) used them to her comedic advantage.
In the Director’s Note, McTaggart explains that his primary objective with “Ruddigore” is to provide pure entertainment, and he succeeds to a great degree. “Ruddigore” is actually funny, and generally the cast radiates an earnest lightheartedness that pervades the entire show. If there is any way in which McTaggart’s production is not entertaining, it is only that “My Eyes are Fully Open” may seem, at times, a taunt: at nearly three hours (including a 20-minute intermission for set changes), sitting through “Ruddigore” is a serious commitment for any theatergoer.

In 2002, Good Charlotte achieved national fame with their single, “Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous” which was broadcasted by radio stations all across the United States. They soon achieved these very same lifestyles, as photos of brothers Joel and Benji Madden graced the pages of magazines and tabloids alongside Hollywood regulars like Nicole Richie. Good Charlotte fit the pop-punk mold perfectly despite their success, and their ever-angsty lyrics became popular among teens and young adults alike. Their latest release “Cardiology” provides both the typical pop-punk vibe that has become expected of the band since their first album, as well as a sound that moves away from this genre. It offers a transition towards a darker, more solid rock sound with pop infusions. Though this musical growth is a welcome change, most of the band’s lyrics flag behind the maturation of their sound.
The third track “Counting the Days” strikes the right musical balance between being reminiscent of the sound that brought Good Charlotte their fame and showing their development as a band. Propelled by a simple, catchy melody, the band achieves a full, complete sound that flows through the entire track. The inclusion of echoing lyrics with a stadium effect also calls back older hit songs such as “The Anthem.” Though the song shows musical growth, the lyrics fail to do the same. “Ever since I saw you, there was no one else / Just you and me / You’re all that I could see” dwells on the same topic of unrequited love that Good Charlotte were singing about 14 years ago.
Other songs serve as evidence that Good Charlotte aren’t quite ready to move on from the lyrical themes of partying, youth, and girls. “Like It’s Her Birthday” indulges in old sounds but amps up the complexity with funkier guitars. Yet the lyrics once again fail to show any maturity or growth. “She’s so wasted, acting crazy / Making a scene like it’s her birthday / Drinking champagne, going insane / Falling on me, like it’s her birthday.” “Last Night” falls into the same trap. It offers unique riffs in the beginning, and strays further away from typical punk pop as the band experiments with synthesizers, but like on the former, the lyrics don’t keep up with the musical maturation. Madden sings, “Can’t remember what happened / Did it happen, last night? / I woke up this morning / Where’s my car, where’s my keys / Where’s my clothes? / But I think I just had the best night of my life.”
Though most of Good Charlotte’s new songs still recall high-school angst, the band does give a more introspective look at growing up in a few of their tracks. On “Harlow’s Song (Can’t Dream Without You),” “Standing Ovation,” “1979,” and “Right Where I Belong,” Good Charlotte make themselves more vulnerable by exploring new themes that are more relevant to where they are in their lives. These lyrics are a far cry from the other songs that are driven by a sense of youthful narcissism. “Harlow’s Song” is a heart-felt dedication to lead singer Joel Madden’s daughter, Harlow. It showcases a softer tone in Madden’s vocals as well as a more sensitive side of Good Charlotte’s songwriting that the band has not expressed in their previous work.
“Cardiology” concludes with its title track, which starts quietly with choral harmonies in the background. Sound effects subdue Joel Madden’s voice. Unlike many of the other songs on this album, this song is not powered by drums or a catchy bass line. There is an eerie effect similar to the sound of someone breathing through an oxygen mask in the background. Lyrics such as, “Cardiology is guiding you and me / Direction, history, and new technology / Cardiology is a mystery / Is there a formula that could possibly explain / What can feel so good / And bring you so much pain?” suggest that the band members have grown over the span of their fourteen years in the music industry. This maturation is shown consistently throughout the album in its musical progress, yet some of the lyrics show nothing of the kind. “Cardiology” seems to be the product of a band unable to mediate between their discoveries as adults and their obligations to a youthful audience.

N.E.R.D.’s latest release, “Nothing,” is interspersed with moments of politically salient commentary and laughably overt sexuality. Though the album’s variety could have made “Nothing” more interesting, N.E.R.D. make a clumsy transition between these two poles. Neither musically nor lyrically inspiring, “Nothing” even fails to be a collection of dance-worthy hip-hop tracks. Though the album has some interesting political commentary, it is not enough to salvage the album from its poorly executed anatomy.
The most egregious failure of “Nothing” is its lack of cohesion. It does not have even the slightest hint of unity that turns a collection of songs into an album. “Nothing” begins energetically  with “Party People,” a song with a punchy bass line and a simple beat that back the vocals. The song itself is one of the more successful of the album—it is a cross between funk and hip hop, and the combination of the right instruments and hooks over the danceable tempo makes this track stand out from the rest of the album. This falsely promising energy dissipates with the second song, and the album never recovers its vigor. There is no suggestion of an identifiable flow in the album, as it has no buildup or climax.
The album not only lacks direction, but also presents a variety of styles which—rather than adding to the album—reduces “Nothing” to sounding careless and unfocused. The album jumps illogically between genres like dance, rock, funk, and old-school hip hop. The tracks all have a hip-hop undertone, but it is not enough to hold together the distracted album. The sheer range of styles also contributes to N.E.R.D.’s cursory treatment of each of these genres. The album is stretched too thin, and fails to function as a powerful, or even marginally effective unit.
However, some of the individual songs are successful. Its third song, “Help Me,” is surprisingly politically relevant with lyrics like “See those war machines out there / Are black with your karma do you care? / Just know karma doesn’t stop if you cry.” In the context of the song’s chorus (“No, I won’t kill you, but I’ll watch you die”) and the album’s eleventh track, “It’s in the Air”—which begins with Patrick Kennedy ranting about the press and the war in Afghanistan while drawing attention to “laying of lives down in the nation for the service of our country”—“Help Me” is an interesting commentary on the War on Terror with just the right amount of bitterness.
Unfortunately, the gravity of some of these politically relevant tracks is quickly made trifling due to N.E.R.D.’s indulgence of mainstream hip hop’s and rap’s preoccupation with sex. The second track, “Hypnotize U,” is soothing, with falsetto vocals reminiscent of Justin Timberlake’s “My Love,” until it is cut short by the singer whispering “Touch a girl / Touch a girl / Touch a girl, uh” over and over again. The lyrics of “Perfect Defect” are similarly sexual: “Oh, come on, cheer up baby / You know I make you laugh / Meet Tina, Tanya, Tracy / We’re having a bubble bath.” While acceptable in mainstream hip hop and rap, this overt pull toward sex is out of place in an album that doesn’t quite boast club dance music but tries instead to be politically relevant and critical of society.
Looking beyond the album’s cohesion and the songs’ lyrical and thematic elements, the album still offers nothing profound. The songs are repetitive and lack buildup, release, or any other noticeable dynamic action. Even “Help Me,” which has pertinent lyrics, is held back by the droning guitars and the monotonous shift between its two parts. While many rap and hip-hop songs rely on repetition of catchy beats, the album fails in this regard as well, as it doesn’t have enough hooks to hold its own.
As a unit of songs that make up a whole album, “Nothing” can only be described as a failure. It is not cohesive with regards to theme, style, or tempo, and though a few of the tracks give thought provoking political commentary, the rest are not engaging musically or lyrically. While N.E.R.D.’s interest in politics is admirable, it’s difficult to take their opinions seriously when they are scattered among lyrics like “Life makes me horny.”

There is no reason that Elvis Costello’s latest should be able to stand alone as an album, given that each song draws from different musical genres and time periods. Yet somehow, the veteran composer and songwriter pulls it off. “National Ransom” undoubtedly jumps around, but it is such a pleasurable journey that one can forgive the bumps in the road.
Costello’s second collaboration with producer T-Bone Burnett features upwards of 30 musicians. Each song on this wildly ambitious album draws from the sound of a particular era—the tracks often have settings as specific as a drawing room in Pimlico, London, 1919. The title song, “National Ransom,” is set in the present day. It addresses the recent government bailouts of major corporations, whose bill was footed by the average taxpayer. It echoes sounds of the early 1930s, the last time a similar crisis occurred. Costello belts, “We’re working every day / Paying off the national ransom.”
Because of its sweeping scope, the album can sound disjointed at first. But most tracks are so well executed that Costello gets away with the lack of unity. By far the best track on the album is “Jimmie Standing in the Rain,” a triumph of musical scene-setting. It tells the story of an English cowboy singer riding dreary trains from music hall to music hall. Costello bemoans his sorry fate, “Nobody wants to buy a counterfeited prairie lullaby in a colliery town / A hip flask and fumbled skein with some stage door / Josephine is all he’ll get now.” Costello’s deep bass and the accompanying violins and trumpets give the track a wonderfully melancholy air. It is as though one can see the rain streaking the grimy windows of the Lancashire station where Jimmie awaits the train.
Another well-executed experiment is Costello’s flirtation with Bluegrass. “A Slow Drag with Josephine” and “Dr. Watson, I Presume” sound like Costello meets the Coen brothers’ Soggy Bottom Boys. “A Slow Drag with Josephine” even concludes with a minute of whistling. Alongside these rather uncharacteristic tracks are a couple examples of a sound Costello has explored before, marked by low, grumbling vocals, simple instrumentation, and prominent percussions. “Church Underground” is one of a handful of tracks on the album that address Catholicism. Interestingly, Costello seems to revert to his classic sound on these religiously inspired tracks. This reflection of an earlier musical style seems to parallel Costello’s reference to another aspect of his past, namely his Catholic upbringing.
These tracks that pay tribute to a former time feature some of the finest writing on the album. Costello is a master lyricist, and he is at his finest on “Stations of the Cross,” where he offers his own take on Jesus’s martyrdom, singing, “He’s buying his way into heaven I suppose / He weeps at the blows.” Though these are standout tracks, Costello’s aptitude with words shines throughout the album. “Dr. Waton, I Presume” is particularly poetic. Its opening verse sets the tone, “This black and clipped misshapen thing / Hobbling on from claw to ring / Hung upside down and cawing / Pecking at carrion of the fallen battalion thawing.”
Costello could be forgiven for running out of steam at this point in his 40-year career, but if anything, this album suffers from an excess of ambition. “National Ransom” is monumental at 16 tracks long. Costello is talented enough to pull off the mammoth task he has set for himself, but at times the project seems to be a bit of a stretch. The album drags on some of the slower tracks like “One Bell Ringing” and “All These Strangers.” Still, “National Ransom’s” faults are easy to overlook in sight of its achievements. The album’s most remarkable feature is Costello’s ability to convincingly mimic many disparate musical styles. The tracks never sound showy or contrived, despite the fact that some, like “Jimmie Standing in the Rain,” are obviously meant to be theatrical.
“Album” may be the wrong word, even a reductive word, to describe “National Ransom.” It is simply a collection of songs that Costello penned with T-Bone Burnett. The album has little focus and even less cohesion, which can be problematic in other cases. However, there is a single thread that ties together Costello’s latest work, and it is the high standard of creativity and ambition laced through every track.

Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno: a prodigious name for a prodigious man. Eno is a pioneer of music, and his iconic and unsurpassed visionary steps into unmarked musical territory have inspired multitudes of followers. A former member of British art-rock band Roxy Music, Eno has myriad of talents: composer, theorist, singer, musician and producer. He has collaborated with Devo, Robert Fripp, and John Cale, and is venerated as “father” of ambient music following the release of the genre’s landmark album “Discreet Music” in 1975. He was one of the principle creative forces behind the conception of generative music—a system by which chords are generated randomly via a series of algorithms. Eno’s musical legacy is both innovative and extensive, and his latest creation “Small Craft On a Milk Sea” signals anything but a stem to this creative flow.
With albums such as “Ambient 1/Music for Airports” and “Another Day On Earth,” Eno has proven a master of hauntingly subtle ambient sounds which are often simultaneously non-intrusive and distortive. In this vein, his newest creation “Small Craft On a Milk Sea” does not disappoint. However, unlike Eno’s earlier ambient work—such as the Ambient Series, released between 1978 and 1982—this newest record drives up the intensity with the inclusion of greater electronic distortion and more persistent drum beats. “Small Craft On a Milk Sea” has its own organic totality—threads of chords, notes or sounds remain consistent throughout the record’s progression. Eno himself describes this record as a “macro-environment” as it is continuous and regenerative, functioning as its own living system.
The opening track “Emerald and Lime” is both romanticized and fantastical with a slow and progressive introduction. A piano repeats a sultry chord, forging into and out of silence. Various ambiguous instruments both subvert and contribute to the sublime lyricism of the piece. The music demands an exploration of the subconscious as it delves deeper into mystical depth. However, the song ends abruptly without satisfying the exploration it encourages. This is a trend repeated throughout the album: tracks finish without warning, preventing the fulfilment of accumulated suspense. In doing so the tracks are lent a beautiful elusiveness as they allow one to project individual interpretations onto the music.
Songs such as “Small Craft On a Milk Sea” and “Horse” champion this mysterious function. In “Small Craft On a Milk Sea” the rhythmic beats exist apathetically beneath a continuing descent of chords. The beats seem to mimic the human heart and thus, despite their emersion in layers of chord variation, evince a heightened intensity and foreboding. In “Horse” the same rhythmic beats are present, but are faster and more distorted. This ritualistic rhythm is accompanied by electronic distortions that feed into the growing intensity. The resultant effect induced by “Horse” is the sound of schizophrenic mayhem, although it retains a consistent subtlety.
Electronic distortion is a common feature of this collective body of work. “Flint March” is characterized by a dull electronic murmur resting below resurgent, ritualistic drumbeats. However Eno does not solely employ distorted sounds in order to engender chaos. “2 Forms of Anger,” somewhat ironically, employs electronic distortion in order to achieve calmness and tranquillity. Sounds remain perverted but the mild insistence and low drones lend themselves to a sense of peace. The guitar strumming almost sounds like trickling water along the edges of the track. “2 Forms of Anger” is hauntingly sublime, achieving a divine balance between serenity and intensity and between lyricism and distortion.
However, the balance attained in the majority of the tracks in “Small Craft On a Milk Sea” is sadly absent on “Bone Jump.” The overall mood of the song is ethereal, but an electronic keyboard infiltrates the slow, ambient sounds with a virulent march. This intrusion is almost farcical amidst the delicate subtleties of ambient sounds and chords. Unlike on other tracks where the excess shies away before becoming overbearing, the intrusions within “Bone Jump” are left unrestrained. The subversions within this track appear reminiscent of a clichéd movie soundtrack, in sharp contrast to the subtlety of creation on the other tracks.
This sound can be attributed to Eno’s method of creating this record: he took chords or periods of music from movie soundtracks, randomly cohering them together and filling in the gaps with his own creation. Consequently, there are moments when the nuanced atmosphere is strained by predictable chords and virulent emotion such as in “Bone Jump.” However, “Small Craft On a Milk Sea” is overall a fantastic collection of work that Eno can add to his bounteous collection. Most tracks achieve a balance between ambient passivity and gentle perversions of sound, whilst the whole of the work ceaselessly feeds into itself, growing and regenerating with a life of its own.

The perceived function of fashion is an inherent contradiction—oscillating between an artificial construction to be utilized, recycled, and disposed of by the individual, and a means for self-expression. Fashion insists on its function as costume—an image that can be created and recreated for others to see. But it also paradoxically asserts that one’s choice in clothing is somehow a true representation of self. Such a contradiction is less a flaw of the industry or a naïve illusion, and more a reflection of our own conflicted view of what fashion allows us to do.
Cindy Sherman, a high-profile photographer, has been illustrating and critiquing this social paradox in her work since the 1970s. In her emblematic untitled film stills where she enacts various social roles and stereotypes. However, we do not get a sense of who Sherman is as an individual, but of the role Sherman is playing in a complicated process of dressing up and documentation. Commissioned by Pop Magazine for their Autumn/Winter 2010 issue and given access to the entire archive of Chanel haute couture, Sherman produced a bookzine of manipulated photographs of herself dressed in a hodgepodge of outfits. In them she embodies various personalities against the background of a whimsical and fantastical foggy landscape. Taking the revered articles of clothing as literal costume, Sherman dons several wigs, distorts the background, strikes various poses, and digitally alters her face. The result  is a myriad of images: translucent flailing witches, a youthful brunette caught by surprise, a silver-haired bride shrouded in a veil and dress of ostrich feathers. The interaction between Sherman and fashion goes beyond Sherman’s role as an artist, as can be seen in Balenciaga’s Fall 2010 collection. Balenciaga’s creative director Nicolas Ghesquière translates her discussion of construction back into clothing, encasing models in stiff, structured neoprene, densely layered with fragments of quotations by Sherman.
But instead of limiting this relationship to Pop Magazine and Balenciaga, high fashion’s affinity for an artist who insists and demonstrates that appearances and conventions are inherently constructed must be further examined.
It is clear that Sherman’s process of shifting, constructing, and fulfilling numerous roles is not so different from expectations of the fashion industry itself. Fashion is characterized and defined by this transience and disposability or Sherman’s construction and reconstruction. Her use of Chanel haute couture is eerily similar to fashion’s own aspiration to produce and transform of appearance. Take for instance the month-long extravaganza that is constituted by the respective Fashion Weeks in New York, London, Milan, and Paris. Models are cast in multiple shows a day. They can go from having white clay sculpted into their hair, to donning black Joan Jett wigs to dying their, hair peroxide blonde in a few hours. And that’s just hair.
Designers are expected to reinvent and reinterpret themselves each season; to produce something novel, intriguing, and relevant. In three seasons, Alexander Wang has gone from a riff on American sportswear to dark deconstructed Wall Street suits to all-white ensembles that wandered between strong structure and loose drapery. As a result, the expectation for the consumer is to do the same.
This does not have to be done at the speed of Vogue Nippon editor Anna Dello Russo having three extravagant outfit changes each day of Milan Fashion Week or a minor celebrity stalking trends to make best-dressed lists. It can, however, be achieved at a more practical and realistic level—jeans that go from bootcut to skinny to jegging to boyfriend, skirts that transition from mini to maxi, sweaters that phase from cropped and tight to chunky knits.
Yet, the fashion industry stops short of Sherman. It is unwilling to relinquish the myth of fashion’s capacity for self-expression, reflecting our own discomfort with the thought that appearance can be manipulated and boiled down to artifice.
Magazines, which promote these ideas of transformation in their spectacular photo shoots and advertisements, simultaneously insist on the ability of clothing to represent and express the self. Style advice and advertisements assert that the right garment, hairstyle, and beauty product can somehow let your “true self” and “inner beauty” shine through. Or maybe this paradox is most obvious in the phenomenon of street-style photography. With it the industry segregates high fashion and personal style, as if the two were not as muddled on the sidewalks as on the runway.
In some sense, I think the industry’s unwillingness or reluctance to go as far as Sherman in declaring that all presentations of ourselves are automatically artificial and constructed is partially our own. We want to believe in the ability to consistently change our appearances and refashion ourselves if need be. Nevertheless, we are also not quite ready to abandon the idea that we can express the truth within us if we want to.

It needs to be said: zombies aren’t sexy. Vampires may have hit their highest peak in popularity since “Nosferatu,” but they are an anomaly within the classic monster canon. Drinking blood? Hot. Chewing on entrails? Less so. Sookie wouldn’t find Bill nearly so alluring if his epidermis was liable to sluff off mid-makeout. Fortunately, “The Walking Dead” goes for the brains, like any good zombie would.
When the first episode of “The Walking Dead” aired on—surprise, surprise—Halloween, it became AMC’s highest rated premiere to date. The series is a bold choice for the network, improbably broadening their output from the decidedly highbrow “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad” to include a traditionally B-movie subject: the moaning, rotting, flesh-hungry undead. And, perhaps even more improbably, the series deserves every word of the tremendous acclaim it’s received so far.
The zombie zeitgeist, in addition to being painfully alliterative, is not to be overlooked. The last decade has seen the release of—among many other zombie movies—“Shaun of the Dead,” “28 Days Later,” “28 Weeks Later,” a remake of “Dawn of the Dead,” and, in print, “The Zombie Survival Guide.” (Full disclosure: I dressed up as Shaun for Halloween 2005. Exactly one person correctly identified my costume.) The post-apocalyptic zombie narrative fits like a comfortable—if bloodstained—pair of shoes. For the most part, the viewer has a good idea of what to expect, which is both convenient and frustrating for a newcomer to the genre. “Shaun” may have pioneered the rom-zom-com, but “The Walking Dead” is a compelling step back to zom-dram.
The pilot enlists the scripting and direction of Frank Darabont, known for his Oscar-nominated film adaptations of Stephen King’s “The Shawshank Redemption,” “The Green Mile,” and “The Mist,” and the migratory survivors of “The Walking Dead” recall “The Stand,” another King classic, as well as a bleak, Bill Murray-free “Zombieland.”
Yet, despite echoes of conventional zombie tropes—protagonist Rick Grimes even awakens in a hospital, similar to a sequence in “28 Days Later”—“The Walking Dead” never feels stale. Grimes’ return to his deserted home is fresh and excruciating. The first episode of “The Walking Dead” manages never to err on the side of camp nor melodrama, distinguishing itself in excellent details: the joy of the first hot shower in too long; the difficulties of parenting under end-of-the-world circumstances; the sheer scale of the zombie population.
But neither does the series stray uncomfortably far from its predecessors. Director George Romero, the so-called Grandfather of the Zombie, defined our post-voodoo conception of the monster with 1968’s “Night of the Living Dead.” Romero famously (and indignantly) denounced the speedy zombies depicted in the remake of his “Dawn of the Dead,” on the grounds that—of course?—zombies can’t run. While the titular walking dead don’t violate any such sacred tenets, they’re refreshingly lither than the stiff-armed, Frankensteinian zombies of yore.
Until now, zombies had yet to serve as the subject of a mainstream American TV show. A 2008 UK miniseries, “Dead Set,” was critically acclaimed for its portrayal of a zombie outbreak. But a five-episode run isn’t much. I am, however, confident in the relative staying power of “The Walking Dead.” Based on an award-winning comic series that has accumulated more than 70 issues since its 2003 debut, the series has plenty to work with.
Writing the show, however, will have its own challenges. Zombies are necessarily a void of personality, so for a television program about them to sustain itself, the human characters had better be compelling. Sheriff’s deputy Rick Grimes, played by British actor Andrew Lincoln, cuts a more imposing figure than Simon Pegg’s geeky Shaun. But Grimes is no Superman. His flaws are what make him interesting to watch. “True Blood” intuitively crossbreeds the vampire myth with the bodice-ripper novel, but as The Atlantic’s Alyssa Rosenberg suggests, “The Walking Dead” has much more in common with a Western—Rick Grimes even gallops into Atlanta on a horse.
The AMC viewer advisory that appeared before the episode nebulously warned of its “intense” content. While it certainly is graphic, the brilliance is that it is simultaneously intensely cerebral.  Indeed, the part of the show I’m most excited to see develop are the beginnings of a theme explored beautifully in Romero’s films: humans can be more frightening than any monster.

Devoid of frilly tutus, glittery crowns, and any sparkling set design, the Harvard Ballet Company (HBC) presented “Barre None” this past weekend, showcasing ballet in its purest form. With a focus on movement and rhythm, HBC embraced and subverted neoclassical ballet using contemporary elements. Featuring choreography from George Balanchine as well as professional and student choreographers, “Barre None” proved compelling to both ballet aficionados and amateurs.
The opening performance of “Barre None” foreshadowed what would be a rather unordinary show. Following in the Balanchine tradition, the New College Theatre, bare of props, featured a single light illuminating choreographer and performer, Ashey A. Chung, HLS ’12. Dancing to T.V. Carpio’s cover of the Beatles classic, “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” Chung effortlessly adhered to both Balanchine’s emphasis on straight lines and a more unconventional port de bras, or the movement of a dancer’s arms and upper body.
As Balanchine believed in an interconnectedness of dance and music, Chung’s piece held the audience’s hand towards the second, which featured excerpts from the choreographer’s “Walpurgisnacht.” A difficult routine, the first excerpt was not smooth at some points. There was a lack of chemistry between the featured dancers, Elizabeth C. Walker ’11 and Kevin Shee ’11.
Shee appeared to have a difficult time supporting Walker as she made her turns, or tours de promenade, and although the individual supporting dancers each showed good form, they were not completely synchronized at times. However, as the dance progressed, the dancers’ execution became more precise, especially as different soloists took the stage.
Soloist Whitney R.S. Fitts ’12 was particularly outstanding; her movements were perfectly in line with the music, and the expression from her face to her body was pure. Despite a somewhat shaky beginning, “Walpurgisnacht” proved a solid choice of a Balanchine piece for those new to the world of ballet.
HBC followed with “Exit Tension,” departing from the neoclassical and introducing the audience to a more modern, jazz-infused style of ballet, choreographed to contemporary music. Departing from the tradition of ballet slippers and leotards, the performers were barefoot and wore simple grey and pink tank dresses. Their movements were quick as they soared across the stage, blurring the divide between the strict linearity of traditional ballet and the deconstructed lines of more modern dance. Esther Y. Hsiang ’12 was flawless as the “Flightless Bird” of this featured Iron & Wine song.
The next piece, “Reset,” a duet, was the most electrifying of the night. The lights rapidly switched on and off during the introduction, an effect that imitated a storm around duo Melanie J. Comeau ’13 and Shee. The lighting effects seemed to empower the dancers’ chemistry, as their graceful strength and speed demonstrated their talent.
In “That’s the Way This Works,” HBC performed guest choreographer Peter Pucci’s modern interpretation of J.S. Bach’s baroque music. At times, the piece felt like an exercise video—ten dancers clad in different brightly colored tank tops and black leggings performed a routine featuring quick shifts of their feet and arms. But one could appreciate Pucci’s transitions from 10 individual movements to duets, to trios and group synchronized movements.
The final piece of “Barre None,” “Behind Closed Doors,” tied in the theme of the entire show: elements of ballet may be celebrated in both traditional and unconventional styles.
Dressed in office attire, the dancers of this piece seemed to invite the audience into the world of ballet, one in which few ever enter. In fact, HBC opened the doors for its viewers last weekend, asserting that there is “no bar” and no limit to the possibilities of ballet.
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 9, 2010
An earlier version of the Nov. 9 arts article "HBC Raises the 'Barre'" incorrectly reported that Elizabeth C. Walker is a member of the class of 2012. In fact, she is in the class of 2011.

“Four Lions,” British comedic heavyweight Christopher Morris’s first full feature-length film as a director, cuts through the hazy and foreign haughtiness of terrorism to expose a surprisingly realistic dose of comedy culled from real life.
Morris explains that one of his interests is the subject of terrorism, which inspired him to write the film. “The subject was interesting, but real life was the key, or the queue,” he said in an interview with The Crimson. “I didn’t set out to make anything, [I was] just trying to boost my knowledge… So, I was just doing some reading, and I kept finding things which were funny, and I thought, ‘This is the wrong place to find funny things.’”
One example Morris gives is of a group of Islamic militants in Yemen who attempted to bomb an American warship, but fail as their boat—filled with explosives—sinks near the beach. “That’s the story that really got me to realize that you can look at [terrorism] in a different way.”
Prior to directing, Morris established himself in the entertainment industry as a comedian, hosting several spoof news British television and radio shows including “On the Hour,” “I.T.,” “Brass Eye,” and the award-winning BBC2 comedy “The Day Today” for which he wrote and co-produced. In these productions, he confronted the language of news reporting and media hysteria with satire.
Although the subject of terrorism is still highly controversial, Morris maintains sensitivity to the issue while still creating a humorous film by keeping the comedy about real life. “Though the film is full of jokes, the jokes are not about the wrong things because that would be a different kind of plan. That’s how you hold on to the balance.” He adds, “You just keep your sense of perspective in mind in what you’re doing.”
“The stuff of comedy [deals] with tension, and character, and people disagreeing with each other when they almost agree and they have the biggest argument in the world—all those [funny] things which are familiar from everyday life don’t stop once you’re commissioning an act of terrorism,” he explains.
One of the chief sources of comedy in this film stems from the remarkable cohesion of the cast. Morris describes the strength of the individual cast members and their interactions while they lived together for five weeks during filming, jokingly saying, “We could have turned them into a cell and I could have gone in there with some angry words and rousing aspirations and they could blow something up.”
“They all hung out together and cooked their relationships, and in a similar way with what happens in these kinds of groups, they became a really tight group in a weird world in themselves where the outside world mattered much less than the inside,” says Morris. “I’ve radicalized them all.”

Much like several earlier Dreamworks animated features, “Megamind” is a lively and witty kids’ film without a great deal of depth. Rather than convey evocative themes, it offers roughly 90 minutes of light-hearted superheroic antics. But though “Megamind” may not stretch far beyond the expectations of a modern children’s movie, it certainly demonstrates a new take on the age-old battle between good and evil, wrapped up in a stunning visual package.
The story follows the rivalry of the two main characters, a perpetual hero named Metro Man (Brad Pitt) and his evil alien counterpart, Megamind (Will Ferrell). The two supernatural beings, both born in outer space and sent to Earth, have been engaged in a struggle of good versus evil literally since birth. Through a bizarre series of events though, Megamind—who describes himself as being “always thirsty, never satisfied”—needs to find a new hero to fight and accidentally creates one in an unlikely news cameraman (Jonah Hill). All of this, combined with a love triangle between hero, villain, and an attractive news reporter (Tina Fey), makes for 96 minutes of clean humor and childlike adventure.
This film’s visual success may be attributable to its experienced director, Tom McGrath. As an animator, a voice actor, a director, and a screenwriter, McGrath not only directed “Megamind” but provided two of the voices for minor characters as well. He also directed Dreamworks’ “Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,” and has worked as a writer, storyboard artist, and animator for several other Dreamworks productions. It’s obvious that this film was created by an expert, as its plot line calls for explosive car scenes and extensive periods of flight. The 3D effects also make it especially pleasing to watch, as characters fly right out of the screen and collapsing buildings seem to topple into the cinema’s audience.
“Megamind” also shows that some actors are so comically talented, they don’t even need to be filmed on camera to effectively get a joke across. Ferrell, Fey, Hill, and even Pitt (whose Metro Man isn’t granted much screen time) all prove to be hilarious and endearing animated characters, whether they’re saving the world or trying to destroy it. Their voices are immediately recognizable and bring life to ridiculous characters who sometimes have something of value to say; in a moment of poignancy, for example, Pitt’s character states, “You can’t trap justice. It’s an idea, a belief.”
Like “Shrek” and many other of Dreamworks’s modern takes on classic stroylines, “Megamind” is full of not only classic morals, but also subtly disguised adult humor that takes the form of quick jokes and details in setting and costuming. Curses are tactfully avoided throughout—when “Highway to Hell” is played in the background of one scene, the final word of the title is constantly obfuscated. The film also makes references to several aspects of modern culture that its younger viewers may not recognize, like President Obama’s campaign posters and the original “Karate Kid” movie. The movie’s animator also made the characters humanly surrealistic and, for lack of a better word, hot—Metro Man is complete with a washboard six-pack and Fey’s character is polished with an hourglass-shaped figure and dimples. These details may seem trivial but they make “Megamind” appealing for adults while still being appropriate for all ages.
Unfortunately, the intended audience of “Megamind” is also the reason it can’t take on themes more profound than good versus evil and the importance of accepting people’s differences, but such is the nature of standard children’s fare. Though its plot line and final conclusion may leave more mature audiences yearning for greater complication, this film is certainly successful in being a well-intentioned fable with a modern twist.
In an exciting scene toward the end of the film, Megamind says “The thing about bad guys? They always lose.” Likewise, the thing about kids’ movies? They tend to lack depth, but sometimes make up for it in humor and cheerfulness. “Megamind” is definitely a visual masterpiece, and between its esteemed director and extremely personable actors, this film’s cliched themes are definitely overpowered by its wit and charm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The way to stop the Feds tracking you is very simple,” one aspiring jihadi tells another, “You eat your SIM card.” In “Four Lions,” a British comedy that details the misadventures of four wannabe terrorists, the sheer stupidity of the four is the source of most of the humor. Laughter and terrorism may seem an incongruous mix, and the very premise of the film is liable to induce shudders in some more politically-correct viewers. But “Four Lions” doesn’t shy away from controversy, presenting a world in which the terrorists seem no worse than any other character. Neither excessively moralizing, nor entirely amoral, “Four Lions” seeks to show its audience that terrorists are people too—and not smart ones. It also successfully overcomes the seeming contradiction between comedy and terrorism, imbuing its social commentary with plenty of black humor, whiplash verbal exchanges, and dramatic flair.
“Four Lions” is the tale of Omar (Riz Ahmed), Waj (Kayvan Novak), Barry (Nigel Lindsay), and Hassan (Arsher Ali), four Britons with abstract ambitions to martyr themselves and a knack for getting into trouble along the way. The film chronicles their desperate, misguided attempts to blow themselves up, including an ill-fated trip to an Al Qaeda training camp in Pakistan that ends when Omar accidentally fires a rocket-propelled grenade the wrong direction and annihilates the camp. The plot is loose and the characters rarely seem to make any forward progress, yet the peculiar tension bestowed by the knowledge that the protagonists, incompetent as they are, intend to commit mass murder, ensures that the film never feels meandering.
The four main characters take their cues from several broad, comic archetypes: Omar, the wise-cracking but apparently sensible leader; Waj, the child-like sidekick whose vision of heaven is the “rubber-dinghy rapids” ride at British theme park Alton Towers; Barry, the not-so-wise older firebrand who advocates blowing up a mosque to kick start the “final jihad”; and Hassan, the wide-eyed new convert. But all four embrace their roles with enough panache to elevate them above the level of caricature. Omar in particular combines his sharp tongue and terrorist aspirations with a seemingly idyllic home life—albeit one in which he uses “The Lion King” to teach his son the virtues of jihad—creating a character just confused enough to be believable.
The entire cast benefits from the screenplay’s razor-sharp wit. Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, who wrote the script along with director Christopher Morris, previously served as writers for cult television political comedy “The Thick Of It,” and the profane banter which was that show’s trademark translates well into “Four Lions.” The film’s dialogue combines the profound and the ridiculous to brilliant comic effect—as when Omar decries Britain as a “who-gives-a-fuck-about-dead-Afghans-Disneyland.”  These crackling back-and-forths —most frequently between Omar and Barry as they struggle for leadership of their makeshift terrorist cell—lend the film much of its propulsion.
Another clear influence on the film is the director’s past work. Morris made his name with fake news programs like “The Day Today,” which mercilessly lampooned the media’s proclivity for exaggeration and hysteria. The media is a constant presence in “Four Lions,” both in its themes and its cinematographic style. The hand-held camerawork—which is integrated into the film itself when the terrorists use similar cameras to record their escapades—suggests not just a documentary style but the news media reports Morris once parodied.
In part, he’s poking fun at the U.K. media craze over “homegrown terrorists.” As the film progresses, however, it becomes apparent that Morris has a bigger goal in mind. “Four Lions” provides little direct political commentary; there is essentially no background information about the terrorists, and audiences are left to speculate about their motives and the source of their radicalization. However, like “The Thick Of It” and “The Day Today,” the film uses absurdity and exaggeration—within an incongruously documentary aesthetic—to draw out society’s failures.
“The Thick Of It” targeted politicians, and the “The Day Today” lampooned journalists. “Four Lions” aims more broadly, highlighting the imbecility of terrorists, police, and average citizens alike.

“Monsters” could be described in short as “District 9” in Mexico, except with amphibious giant octopi as the aliens. This is a bit of a simplification but still manages to capture the socially conscious sci-fi subgenre into which “Monsters” neatly fits. Despite the film’s gripping sci-fi premise, it flounders because of its excessive focus on the limp romantic relationship between the two leads.
Six years before the story begins, a NASA space probe breaks up upon re-entry over Mexico, resulting in over half the country being quarantined and designated as an “Infected Zone.” The plot, at least for the middle third of the film, focuses on the romantic development between the two main characters Samantha Wynden (Whitney Able) and Andrew Kaulder (Scoot McNairy), the latter of whom is sent by his wealthy and powerful boss—Samantha’s father—to ensure her safe passage home. After failing to make the last ferry back to the U.S., the two rashly choose to take their chances on foot through the infected zone.
Excelling cinematographically, the film manages to find a balance between artsy composition and jittery sci-fi camera work. Perhaps as part and parcel of inserting an emotional drama into a sci-fi thriller, there are numerous sweeping panoramic shots. But in the more action-packed scenes, director Gareth Edwards engages in the shaky-camera technique popular in action thrillers such as the “Bourne” trilogy. When the monsters—which are gruesomely rendered in CGI—are on screen the film effectively engages the viewer. However, the tempo lags throughout much of the movie due to the contrived romantic tension supposedly driving the plot through the less suspenseful sections.
Certainly, even in a sci-fi thriller, it is necessary to provide motivation for the characters—unfortunately, the blossoming sexual tension between Able and McNairy’s characters falls completely flat due to the leads’ emotionally drained acting. McNairy, who as Kaulder fills the role of the mean-spirited and culturally ignorant American, portrays little emotional affect, resulting in a character both perennially annoyed and lacking in depth. When sitting around the fire discussing the nature of the United States’ response to the alien outbreak with their Mexican guides, Wynden rejoinders a comment made about the wall along the border with, “Yeah, it’s like we’re imprisoning ourselves... Yeah.” Able delivers the line like a valley girl, which only serves to undercut the film’s attempt at meaningful social commentary.
The filmmakers’ engagement in real-world issues is often scattershot. Touching on topics such as spectatorship, racism, inequality, and immigration, the motif returned to most often is that of America’s tendency to shoot first and ask questions later. When speaking of the aliens, a guide says, “If you don’t bother them, they don’t bother you. When the American planes come the creatures get mad. They go crazy.” But even this theme is inconsistently applied, as at points throughout the movie the creatures appear to be attacking unprovoked—the guide himself is killed for no reason shortly after delivering that line of dialogue.
Though their intersection is sometimes forced, the combination of cinematography and social commentary culminates in many of the film’s most effective moments. For example, as a transition between scenes the camera lingers momentarily on a small child sitting in the window of a shack, with a large machine gun leaning against its wall. The omnipresence of violence is tied into the increasing integration of the monsters into Mexican culture—a public mural in the background of a brief scene depicts a battle between armed humans and the angry creatures. Another well-shot moment occurs when Kaulder and Wynden wander into an area of memorials adorned with candles and flowers. The camera pans to a sign saying “Stop The Attacks 5000 Dead,” indicating that the bombing of monsters is killing civilians. The symbolism becomes obvious when a moment a later a helicopter flies by, putting out the candles, resulting in a meaningful and aesthetically pleasing sequence.
Like all the best sci-fi movies, “Monsters” proves an effective vehicle for a persuasive critique of human conduct. Unfortunately, however, the film’s social mission is undermined by the weak love story. Frustration with the characters’ lack of emotional affect is only aggravated by the film’s obvious plot hole. Given that it is a story of two rich Americans finding their way back to the U.S., audiences might find themselves wondering why the characters don’t just take an airplane to fly around the infected zone. Sadly, the current age of modern aviation undercuts the over-land adventure story, resulting in a large chunk of the film feeling pointless as well as meandering.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year during Harvard’s inaugural January Term, Emily B. Hecht ’11, woke up before 9 a.m. six days a week. Most Harvard students—at least those who weren’t interning, traveling abroad, or practicing for the upcoming sports season—were building up sleep stores in preparation for the coming semester. Hecht, a participant in the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) graduate-level training intensive for undergrads, was giving up sleep to work with performance experts from across the world and hone her acting expertise in preparation for a potential career on stage. “They really treated us like budding professionals. They treated us like real potential artists,” she says.
The three-week theater intensive allowed students to interact regularly with big names like Scott  Zigler, Director of the Institute for Advanced Theatre Training at the A.R.T.; Jim True-Frost, who was cast in the HBO hit “The Wire”; and David A. Hammond ’70, who has held teaching positions at the Julliard School, the American Conservatory Theater, and the Yale School of Drama.
This J-Term, a larger portion of the student body will have access to experiences like Hecht’s through the introduction of the January Arts Intensives. The college is currently planning seven shorter intensives in comedy, design, creative writing, watercolors, and ceramics, and one three-week performance intensive with a dance track and a theater track. The implementation of such programs is a direct response to President Drew G. Faust’s Arts Initiative, launched in November 2007. Given that they are still in their pilot stage, however, the organizers must work through challenges in balancing varied levels of student ability, ensuring program growth and sustainability, and avoiding the impression that committed artistic production should be relegated to the confines of January.
THE BEST-LAID PLANS...
The original plans for J-Term suffered a blow when the economic crisis hit Harvard. When the new calendar changes were first proposed in June 2007, the month of January turned into an enticingly blank canvas. The Undergraduate Council (UC) spoke with the chairs of the Gen Ed Committee and the Ad Board Review Committee to organize innovative programming, short intensive classes, and opportunities to explore areas students may not have had time for during the school year.  J-Term was never meant to be a month-long recuperation of lost sleep for overworked students, but the loss of over one quarter of the endowment limited opportunities for programming during the last weeks of Winter Break.
This January, the story is changing. “This year is really a big experiment,” says Eric N. Hysen ’11, UC Vice President. “This is the first time that students will be able to be on campus participating in programs without class other than Camp Harvard and Senior Week.”  The Undergraduate Council has successfully pushed for Optional Winter Activities Week (OWAW), in which students will be able to return to campus a week early and receive funding for creative programming ideas open to the whole campus.
This effort, along with the college’s decision to open campus early to all students, helped set the stage for the new January Arts Intensives. With the freedom of an open, class-free campus, students who crave artistic opportunities will be able to experience them in a unique way. As advertised, interested undergrads will be able to use technology to explore architectural fictions, examine modes of bodily thinking through dance, break into the world of stand-up comedy, and workshop poetry.
The choice to focus on bringing art to campus during J-Term is a reflection of how seriously college officials are taking the Report of the Task Force on the Arts. Published in December 2008, the report presented a detailed and comprehensive reflection on the arts at Harvard that advocated a complete renewal in the way the university thinks about art.
“I think that report has had a large impact on the arts and how it relates to Harvard campus,” says Elizabeth Lerman, the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “Genius” Grant and instructor of the dance track of the three-week A.R.T. intensive. “It’s really timely that Harvard is welcoming practicing artists to campus in such a big, or at least such a particular way.”
The report specifically called for greater college recruitment of practicing artists, strengthened links between Harvard University and affiliated arts institutions like the A.R.T., and suggested the creation of undergraduate architecture courses in conjunction with the Graduate School of Design (GSD). The intensives are direct responses to these calls to action: all are conducted by numerous well-respected and award-winning artists, some are provided in conjunction with the A.R.T., and one specifically creates a partnership between the GSD and the college.
“This whole notion of arts intensives grows out of the university’s increased and deepened commitment to promoting arts practice at Harvard University.  I think of this as an extension of that bigger commitment to support student art-making,” says Jack Megan, Director of the Office for the Arts (OFA).
A BALANCING ACT
Aspiring arts professionals like Hecht are not the only targets of these January Arts Intensives. Program instructors and administrators make it clear that students of all levels of experience are welcome to join the programs.
For some of the intensives, like “Architectural Fictions,” taught by GSD architecture professor K. Michael Hays and doctoral student Jawn Lim, this will be an easier task to balance than for others. Most students will start out on a level playing field due to the lack of architecture and design classes offered to undergraduates at the college.
“We really want to make it so that we can start without any prior exposure to architecture. That limits what we can do, but I think we can still give people an idea of this way of thinking,” says Hays.
In five six-hour sessions, most of which will consist of studio work interspersed with lectures, Hays hopes to give students a sense of the ways in which architectural ideas fit into a liberal arts education. “It’s sort of our position that architecture is more than just designing buildings and objects. You can think through architecture about being in the world,” he says.
The three-week performance intensive, the second iteration of the A.R.T.’s January offerings to undergrads, has a more challenging task ahead. Balancing complete newcomers with seasoned hands is vital in ensuring the artistic development of all students.
Bianca F. Okafor ’13 is one such newcomer. “I just want to learn something new. I didn’t want to stay home for all of break because I would just get really bored. I don’t really see theater as a career for me,” she says. Her attitude stands in stark contrast to that of Hecht, who will use the upcoming J-Term for thesis work and auditions for theater companies in the area.
Lerman has spent some time thinking about this problem, especially since student artistic pursuit tends to happen more in the realm of extracurricular activities than through organized instruction at Harvard. “It’s true that Harvard has a lot of students who have a lot of artistic background, and they’re hungry,” she says. “The dancers that I met at Harvard on my last visit—I really got a feeling that they’re looking for an intense opportunity to really stretch themselves. It’s a challenge to figure out how to embrace them both.”
Despite these concerns, however, the vast majority of students involved in the intensives will probably already be artistically involved. Advertising for the intensives has not been widely disseminated, focusing primarily on students connected to the OFA via the email subscription list, classes related to the intensive offerings, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) email list. “We’ll just keep beating the drums as much as possible,” says Thomas Lee, Program Manager of “Learning From Performers” at the OFA and coordinator of the OFA’s intensive offerings, in speaking to the intention to advertise programs more broadly in the future.
BUILDING MOMENTUM
There is a pervasive feeling of excitement among the artists and administrators planning the intensives, as well as from students who hope to participate. “It is gratifying to see the quantity of applications received and we are pleased to be able to accommodate a majority of the students,” writes Lori E. Gross, Associate Provost for Arts and Culture, in an email. “It is wonderful to see such excitement and enthusiasm from the undergraduates to make art and learn from professional artists.”
If excitement is already high about the intensives, the growth and sustainability of these programs are serious issues to consider for the future. “We’re not trying to undertake massive new programs right now that can’t be funded,” says Megan. “Instead, we’re just making a beginning. By focusing on January and a narrow set of opportunities, it becomes more bite-sized and achievable, and we hope that it creates momentum.”
As it stands, planning and funding for the programs has been cobbled together in the collaboration between the Office of the Dean for Arts and Humanities, the Office of the President, the Office of the Provost, and the Office for the Arts. If the momentum that Megan hopes to achieve takes hold, a more streamlined and centralized administrative, funding, and planning organization for these intensives will most likely be necessary.
Questions will likely arise concerning student admission into the intensives as time goes on. Limited enrollment maximizes the benefit each student gains from the programs, but it comes with its own disadvantages. Newly interested students may have to compete for admission with previous participants hoping to continue their artistic development.
Continuity is another potential challenge that planners have already started to consider. There may be tension between offering tried and tested programs that students enjoy and new, riskier programs from different artists available to work on campus.
“Our thinking is that it will be expanded upon and we will be figuring out a kind of mix of things that have worked or will be working hopefully for this January,” says Lee. “We might repeat them but we might add some new ones for subsequent years. Some will draw more than others and we’ll just have to evaluate how that goes.”
DIVERSION TO DEDICATION
Subtly broadcasted messages can be lost in the shuffle of planning and implementing new programs. Harvard has built its reputation on academia; using J-Term to create intense artistic experiences in a time when the vast majority of the university is on vacation runs the risk of casting artistic practice as activity outside the non-academic sphere, whereas the Task Force specifically called to integrate the Arts into Harvard’s academic arena.
Okafor, Hecht, and Katherine M. Agard ’13, another applicant, admit to the fact that a large part of their decisions to apply for and participate in the intensives had to do with the monotony of being at home for too long. “I didn’t want to be at home for five weeks. I knew I would jump out of my skin with nothing to do,” says Hecht. “I was just kind of at home and was like, I need to do something,” adds Agard, in reference to her last J-Term.
Megan asserts that this is not in any way the intention of the intensives. “I haven’t thought of it in that way, because we are not de-emphasizing support for arts initiatives during the academic year. Indeed, we’re investing more,” he says. In particular, he says, the OFA is currently conducting an international search for a new dance director, and recently hired internationally regarded professionals to conduct the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and direct choral activities at Harvard. “I think it’s about taking advantage of a unique window of time to make something important happen,” he adds.
“GIVE IT TIME”
The January Arts Intensives can potentially revolutionize the ways in which art-making happens on campus by leveraging Harvard’s ability to draw the best and the brightest from all disciplines, including the arts. There is a buoyant sense of hope in the air, despite the long and winding road from pilot to full potential. “What I hope is that these will excite the student body, will energize them, will teach them new ways of thinking about art-making, and will infuse their creative work when the semester starts up and they undertake their own projects,” says Megan.
Those involved in the programs also caution against over-thinking so early in the process. The college has planted a fragile seed in offering these intensives, and now watching and waiting is the only way forward. “We just have to give it time, give it time to organically grow and develop. This is just a little tiny slice of what could be possible,” says Lerman.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Discourse on contemporary poetry tends to revolve around the question of crisis; not as to whether there is a crisis, but rather what form the current crisis takes. Perhaps more so than any other popular form of art in America today, poetry has been dominated by the academic impulse. From within the ranks of the poets themselves, the specter of the canon—both national and abroad—rears the possibility that influence will overcome innovation. From without, the multiplicity of theoretical criticism around that very canon leaves the young poet with little recourse but, on one hand, acquiescence, and on the other, the quixotic search for a poetics ‘outside theory.’ Thus the crisis: how to produce original poetry that resists the outermost reaches of the obscure?
In his third collection, Matthew Zapruder prepares his response. “Come On All You Ghosts” is an effort of self-consciously modest proportions; a quiet gesture with grand aspirations, whose aim is the synthesis of a poetic voice that moderates, subtly and lucidly, the encroachment of theory and tradition both. On its surface, the collection examines the host of interlocking themes that have become boilerplate for modern poetic composition—war, nature, technology, memory, identity, alienation—through a restrained, montage-eye, free-verse lyric strategy popularized as early as the emergence of Confessional poetry. The fulfillment of such a tall order is ostensibly Zapruder’s appeal; the poems within “Come On All You Ghosts” deftly place their quotidian subject matters—watching television, witnessing the death of an insect, waiting at the airport—on a revelatory plane, alongside the ineffable power of love and the anxiety of death’s certainty. As if on pinpricks, his imagery turns precisely and delicately between the mind and the world; between the past and the present; between the everyday and the sublime. Here, it seems, a technologically inclined, pop-culture bombarded, and (importantly) nostalgic generation has found a voice of sorts.
The question of whether this project is an ambitious or complacent one, however, deserves attention. However deft, the lion’s share of the 55 poems in “Come On All You Ghosts” betray the traces of an almost cynical satisfaction with the poet’s ability to draw the seemingly dizzying array of themes together into brief, tightly-coiled, elliptical pieces. What is absent, however—palpably so—is a drive for any considerable formal or intellectual engagement with the most recent movements in American poetry. The result is a collection of predominantly uninspired competence, with only periodic flashes of the sort of foraging aesthetic abandon that typically characterizes the work of (relatively) young poet or, alternatively, a great poet of any age. However pleasant in passing, much of the material in “Come On All You Ghosts” is superfluous at best and reactionary at worst.
The opening poems, comprising the first of four sections, are structured loosely around the event—explicitly or implicitly—of the death of Zapruder’s father. Suffice it to say that these are the worst of the collection, treating what could be fertile thematic ground with a tourist’s eye for existentialism. Wind blows. Moments pass or do not pass. The reader waits silently for something of interest.
The collection’s saving grace is its second section, whose standout pieces hint at the sort of bristling, un-neat chaos that might just indicate a heartbeat at the center of all this cold order. The poet eschews the clever interplay of concept and execution, of poetry that half-ironically reads itself, in favor of what can only be called the kinetic abandon of the spirit. “…Between you and me the buildings / also have a space for the sparrow named never who does not sing / yes the cities die when you leave them, yes no one cares what you do,” he almost seems to cry in “You Have Astounding Cosmic News,” in a voice whose mode bounds from playful to sinister to outright desperate. Elsewhere, in “Work,” emerges a mild interest in absurd imagery whose confounding humor is nonetheless arresting: “…I only feel / free when I am working, that is writing / this book about a pair of zombie detectives / who painstakingly follow clues they think / are hidden in an authentic tuscan cookbook.” The reader gleans a jab at the ceaseless call to interpret poetry itself, but the joke dissolves in the sheer incredulity of his frankness.
The image of Zapruder as a complete poet, however, diminishes somewhat as it appears. The restlessness of the second section gives way to a third that sees fit to reestablish the emotional tone of the first, albeit through a broader and more mature perspective. Here his visions are half-realized, happy to abbreviate their power in the interest of self-explication. “The Painted Desert” typifies this impulse; already a sort of tepid confession to a lover, the poem’s final lines nevertheless blush—for an instant—with promise: “Goodbye, someday / I’ll invent the magic lantern, then music, / then whatever’s the opposite of the need / to control everything so it can be perfect for you.” To balk at such a bare expression of love would seem cruel if that expression weren’t so trite.
The title poem constitutes the whole of the final section. Once again, Zapruder’s courage abandons him in favor of a merely appropriate commitment to emotional gesture. The poem begins confidently enough, with an image whose stirring presence returns periodically: “I heard a little cough / in the room, and turned / but no one was there // except the flowers / Sarah bought me / and my death’s head // glow in the dark key chain / that lights up and moans…” The death’s head, in its simplicity, never becomes more than a vacant symbol. The poem plods on from here, a procession of sorry aphorisms—“Please don’t feel the least bit sorry / for me or yourself, // everyone you have ever seen / has a death father, / some are just walking around alive…”—among which stands a particularly egregious invocation of the late David Foster Wallace. Some ghosts are best left undisturbed.
That “Come On All You Ghosts” succeeds in approximating the voice of its intended audience—the educated, morally-engaged, liberal (a handful of the poems have a political bent hardly worth mentioning)—and fails as a work of sufficient challenge or beauty shouldn’t come as any real surprise. Whether from the standpoint honest belief or a calculated posture—Zapruder’s could be either—the self-conscious address of poetry’s ‘crisis’ is, in itself, a fool’s errand. Those poets who come upon its solution—the great poets, the poets for whom the given paradigm of crisis shifts at their whim—do so by seeing through its artifice. Poetry is poetry. There is no crisis.

In the face of state funding cuts, the University of California, Berkeley announced that it will begin charging out-of-state students over $50,000 a year for tuition, fees, and room and board. Berkeley is the first public university in the country to begin charging students over $50k; it charges $27,700 a year to in-state students. In the midst of a financial crisis, it is appropriate for Berkeley to raise tuition for out-of-state students in order to keep tuition down for in-state residents, as the university’s primary responsibility is to residents of California who pay taxes to the state.
In an attempt to compensate for significant reductions in funding, Berkeley has been forced to make drastic budget cuts. The Daily Californian reported that this year, for example, numerous courses are offering fewer labs and discussion sections compared to previous years because the University can not afford to pay graduate students; there are 63 leaky roofs on campus, and a single gardener mows all the campus lawns. Budget cuts alone have not been enough to adjust to such large and sudden funding cuts. If tuition must go up in light of these circumstances, increases that affect only out-of-state students are preferable.
However, such raises should be the last resort to adjust to funding cuts. Although it may not seem like tuition increases change the number of applicants to certain universities, these changes will undoubtedly disadvantage those most in need and make many students think twice about applying.
When schools like Berkeley do raise tuition, they should make every effort to ensure that students who are already attending the university do not have to pay higher fees midway through college. Many American families struggle to find a way to finance their children’s educations; students should not be forced to make new financial plans and face increased financial stress midway through their college careers.
Berkeley’s greatest strength is that it provides a world-class education at state-university prices to in-state students. Thus, even in the face of financial turmoil, the university should not go against its obligation to state taxpayers by admitting more outof- state and international students who pay higher fees than state residents in order to further increase tuition revenues.
Over recent years the Harvard Admissions Office has made a concerted effort to publicize its financial- aid policy in different communities across the country. Berkeley and other public universities should take similar action, aggressively informing potential applicants about their financial-aid options to ensure that qualified applicants are not discouraged from applying because of hefty tuition fees. On a similar note, we applaud the Obama administration’s efforts to make college more affordable by expanding the number of Pell Grants available to students. Public schools should emphasize this option.
However, even given publicity, we are concerned that, unlike private universities with large endowments, public universities are unable to provide sufficient financial aid to cover the increasingly expensive price of tuition. To address this, public colleges and universities should start capital campaigns and alumni donation programs in order to create special endowment funds specifically earmarked for student financial aid.
The state of California and the University of California system are undoubtedly facing great financial strain. There is no question that serious budget cuts and financial adjustments need to be made. As Berkeley faces these choices, we hope that its responsibility to California residents remains at the forefront of the discussion.

The Cold War saw the U.S. wary of the influence of the Soviet Union. By the 1980s, Japan was seen as the new force for the U.S. to reckon with. As highlighted by the campaigns leading up to the recent elections, the latest common enemy of our country is China.
Unfortunately, xenophobic accusations, like those being lobbed against the Chinese, appeal to people and assuage their deepest fears more easily than facts and statistics. In the heyday of American trust in democracy following World War II, the fear of losing freedoms and liberty to Soviet encroachment led to a widespread anti-communist backlash; numerous individuals were blacklisted and ostracized within the U.S. In the 1970s and 80s, anti-Japanese anger permeated throughout popular culture, and over time tensions ignited into violence. In one infamous example, Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American mistaken to be Japanese, was murdered due to an environment of growing American outrage over auto-manufacturing jobs being outsourced to Japan. This, despite the reality that companies had moved offshore to reduce labor costs, so very few of the firings stemmed directly from Japanese competition.
Throughout the decades, political candidates and groups have readily proffered their patriotism and readiness to stand strong with Americans against “foreign devils” without a fuller understanding of the complexities that compose international relations. During this midterm-election cycle, an ad from Citizens Against Government Waste titled “Chinese Professor” elicited enough interest and donations to premiere on network television. The ad portrays a Chinese professor instructing a class in the year 2030 on the reasons behind the downfall of the U.S., highlighting “reckless” policies of the government in terms of spending. However, the message itself seems less about the woes of the government, than about China. The country is cast as the soon-to-be dominant force, smiling upon the misfortune of Americans who, according to the ad, “now work for us.”
Indeed, this election cycle has seen a number of anti-China ads like “Chinese Professor” from both sides of the aisle. However, such characterizations of China as a beneficiary and causative agent of a faltering U.S. have more harmful consequences on the American public than politicians might expect.
Using China as an impetus for action is fraught with “yellow peril,” a term which harkens back to past mistreatment of Chinese-Americans. The associations that become ingrained in the minds of the American public are rarely considered for their long-term impact. Politicians who capitalize on the innate fears of foreign dominance do so for the short-term goal of success at the polls; however, in doing so, they demonstrate their fecklessness in grappling with the very real issues that underlie a complex bilateral relationship. More dangerously, they unwittingly oil the gears of ignorance and prejudice, as American audiences perceive of a specific entity as the primary—and often only—threat to continued prosperity, when the truth dictates that a multitude of players and factors are at play.
A telling example from another perspective is the Chinese government’s recently allowing Chinese citizens to carry out anti-Japanese demonstrations over a territorial dispute, despite its traditional stance of opposing such activities (which are said to go against social stability). A near-daily Chinese media cycle that speaks disparagingly of the Japanese government has fueled such tensions over the years. Increasingly hostile Chinese demonstrators have smashed Japanese storefronts and cars, become violent with security forces, and in one instance have forced pedestrians to strip clothes that too closely “resembled a kimono.” The lack of violence against actual Japanese can be attributed to the largely homogenous nature of Chinese society, but in the U.S., where different ethnic groups co-exist, these tensions can easily manifest themselves into overt confrontations that can lead to unforgiveable outcomes.
Narrow-mindedly depicting China as a unilateral threat is not just a disservice to the realm of fact and reason. It also runs the risk of aggregating representations of the threat, namely Chinese and Asian Americans, with the threat itself. We would do well to learn from our past and present missteps. The strength of this nation’s cohesiveness must not be shattered by the misinformed, inflammatory message of the vocal few.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, I returned home to Pakistan, only to experience the inception of a series of unfortunate events. On July 28, a day after “Shab-e-Barat,” (literally, Night of Destiny, which Muslims spend in prayer) 152 people died in a plane crash. A day after that, there were torrential rains in Swat Valley, killing many people.
It didn’t stop there. Each day, the death toll continued to rise as the floods continued to wreak havoc in the lives of many, washing away village after village. Vast areas of agricultural land were destroyed as the heaviest rains in living memory hit Pakistan.
However, this flood-devastated region, which includes the Swat Valley and Chitral, is one that I will always envision as a dreamland, a land of exquisite beauty and serenity, even after the Taliban insurgency. Every summer, as a family tradition, we would travel through northern Pakistan. Just two summers before coming to Harvard, I went through the Karakoram Highway, the highest paved international highway in the world, driving all the way up to Gilgit. I took a small detour to go through the Swat Valley, renowned for its scenic landscapes and Buddhist heritage. We approached Saidu Sharif, the urban hub and capital of Swat, where the lush orchards had been replaced by a myriad of barricades and barbed wires along the newly-built road, an early reminder of the heightened security tension in the once tourist attraction. From here, we drove all the way to a place called Marghazar, where we saw the White Palace, built by the former Ruler of Swat. It was here where we lodged for a mere $10 a night.
The following day, we embarked upon our journey to Kalaam Valley and then beyond that to Mahodand lake. The view was breathtaking; the emerald-green Kalaam river winding around the road on one side and the gigantic mountains of the Hindu Kush on the other. We continued to stop at various stations for a cup of tea and to take photographs of the place. Some of the men were saying their prayers, prostrating on a flat boulder next to a ravine, and probably were oblivious to what the world thought about them. They may have had beards; they may have appeared primitive, but they were not terrorists or radicals. The only things you saw in their eyes were humility and purity. Small children wearing bright shalwar kameez gathered around the car, almost perceiving it to be some magical creature. No words could describe the beauty of these shy and innocent children, who were oblivious of the world and its perplexities. They had no clue of what fate awaited their homes and villages.
Looking back, I wish I had spent more time in appreciating the simplicity of the Swati people, because little did I know that this would be the last time, at least for a long time, where Swat would be in the same state of beauty, peace and tranquility.
Come 02138. Seven thousand miles away across the Atlantic Ocean, in my home away from home, I witness the “image deficit” that Pakistan is facing. It has been unilaterally portrayed in the media as war-torn, ravaged by terrorism, war, and now a natural disaster. However, Pakistan is more than this summation. But just as in Haiti, when the floods hit, nobody is hurting more than the innocent victims of a great catastrophe, people who are drowning not only from the waters, but from disease, famine, poverty, and despair. Nobody is at a loss except the innocent.
Many Pakistanis abroad consider themselves ambassadors for their country, trying to remove the negativity that pervades Pakistan’s image. A nation so brutally damaged by terrorism, fundamentalism, earthquakes. and now floods, Pakistan is probably the last nation on Earth that would be on anybody’s bucket-list. However, it is about time that we remove this image deficit and show Pakistan’s true and vibrant colors. Fortunately, a number of initiatives are being undertaken by various student groups and faculty members to do precisely this and to raise awareness about the floods in Pakistan.
In our capacity as students, there is only so much that we can do to alleviate the suffering of the flood victims. Countless have been orphaned and countless have been deprived of an innocent childhood, out of no fault of their own. These children, who played in the valleys, swam in the lakes, and were nurtured by Mother Nature herself, deserve much better. I only hope the coming generation after me, which has seen only war and despair, can get to see Pakistan’s natural beauty and cultural heritage that I was fortunate enough to see. I only pray that the supplications made on “Shab-e-Qadr” are heard and the “Night of Destiny” truly bring a hopeful destiny for all.

CORRECTION: November 14, 2010
An  earlier version of the  Nov. 9 op-ed "Pakistan’s Image Problem'" incorrectly reported that July  28 was a day after Shab-e-Qadr. In fact, it was a day after  Shab-e-Barat. The Crimson regrets the error.

While liberals are in for a tough few years when it comes to economic policy following Republican gains in Congress last week, there are some reasons to be hopeful about foreign policy. The Obama administration is looking increasingly likely to dial back its commitment to Afghanistan. The new National Security Advisor, Thomas E. “Tom” Donilon, was a noted skeptic of escalation during the administration’s internal debate last year, and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, who backed escalation, is expected to step down shortly. If Gates is replaced with Undersecretary of Defense Michèle A. Flournoy ’83, a counterinsurgency enthusiast, not much will change, but a more dovish pick should signal that the administration is getting ready to leave Afghanistan. And the sooner the administration starts preparing for an exit, the better.
The problem is not that the U.S. cannot win the war. I don’t know that we can’t, and we likely will not know even after it has concluded. Many assume, for example, that the 2007 troop “surge” in Iraq brought down violence there, but with so many competing factors—from the turning from al-Qaeda of Sunni tribal leaders to Moqtada al-Sadr’s unilateral ceasefire declaration—that isolating one factor and crediting it with the reduction is impossible. Years after conflict has ended, chances are we won’t have a better idea of whether American actions could or did “win” the war in Afghanistan.
However, as a critique of the war, the futility argument misses the point. Obviously, if the war cannot succeed, we should not pursue it. But there have been and will be plenty of winnable wars that are nonetheless not worth fighting. The question, then, is not whether we can win in Afghanistan. It is rather whether we should. Given its costs, it seems clear that victory is not worth our while.
Advocates for the war in Afghanistan generally present two arguments: one based on national security and one based on humanitarian concern. The former goes as follows. Afghanistan’s former government fostered a terrorist group that has repeatedly attacked the United States and its allies. Thus, the U.S. should support an alternative regime and try to root out what remnants of that terrorist group persist within Afghani borders.
The first problem with this is that very few al-Qaeda fighters remain in Afghanistan. CIA director Leon E. Panetta puts the number between 50 and 100. Many more are across the border in Pakistan, where America’s ability to act is limited at best. Still others are setting up shop in Yemen. Afghanistan, then, seems a strange place to focus our efforts against al-Qaeda. But even if the preponderance of fighters were in that country, the idea that eliminating “safe havens” will end attacks is dubious at best. The 9/11 plotters worked from an apartment in Hamburg, Germany, the London bombers were homegrown, and, last time I checked, Gerhard Schroeder and Tony Blair, respectively, weren’t sponsoring them. One has to conclude, then, that having a supportive government isn’t necessary for al-Qaeda to pull off attacks.
Occupying Afghanistan, then, is not the best way to prevent al-Qaeda attacks. But how much should the U.S. be spending to prevent attacks in the first place? Terrorism is horrifying, but rare. As the political scientist John E. Mueller has noted, about as many Americans are killed by terrorist attacks as by lightning strikes, deer-related accidents, and allergic reactions to peanuts. Auto accidents cause vastly more deaths. While a nuclear attack would obviously render these comparisons moot, pulling one off is difficult enough that the probability of a successful strike is quite low. As Michael A. Levi explains his book, “On Nuclear Terrorism,” building a nuclear weapon or smuggling one into the United States is exceptionally difficult. Why, then, are we spending billions of dollars a year, and occupying a country, to try to tackle this relatively minor problem, especially when there’s little sign it’s working?
A Time magazine cover story from this past summer showcases the humanitarian cause for occupation: Entitled “What Happens If We Leave Afghanistan,” the piece features a photo of a teenage girl whose nose and ears had been cut off by Taliban affiliates. The implication is that U.S. departure will condemn the people of Afghanistan, especially its women, to the oppressive whims of the Taliban. Of course, the current situation is not exactly ideal— the girl in Time’s photo was victimized last year, not during the Taliban’s reign.
What’s more, the idea that only occupation can help Afghanistan’s people reflects a poverty of imagination. The U.S. expects to spend $115 billion in Afghanistan next year; the 2009 GDPof Afghanistan was $14 billion. It’s hard to believe that airdropping $115 billion in cash over the country, and growing its economy eightfold, wouldn’t do more to improve Afghanis’ welfare than occupying them militarily. If the government wants to aid the people of Afghanistan, it can aid them. If it wants to occupy them, it can occupy them. But let’s not pretend that the latter has much of anything to do with the former.
Whether the goal is defending American security or improving the lives of Afghans, occupying Afghanistan is a wasteful way to meet our objectives. We’d do better to begin pulling out and spending our resources in a more careful and reasoned manner.

In a breakthrough that could lead to a more efficient way of generating therapeutic cell lines, Harvard and MIT researchers have recently discovered the critical role of a set of genetic elements, known as large intergenic noncoding RNAs, in cellular reprogramming.
These findings, which show for the first time the importance of lincRNAs in deriving induced pluripotent stem cells, could better scientists’ understanding of stem cell reprogramming, which reverts cells to their embryonic-like state to be then turned into a different type of tissue.
LincRNAs are essential regulators of cellular reprogramming, but their effects are still poorly understood, leading John L. Rinn, a senior author of the study, to describe them as “the dark matter of the genome.”
To generate pluripotent cells, researchers introduce what is known as a “cocktail” of four transcription factors into adult cells. These factors, which drive the reprogramming process, generate induced pluripotent stem cells.
The mechanism underlying how these factor drive the process is poorly understood, according to Rinn, an assistant professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at the Harvard Medical School.
In the study, the researchers detected elevated levels of lincRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells, and found that the lincRNAs are also targeted by pluripotency reprogramming factors.
“We know the general architecture with the four ‘cocktail’ proteins, but we didn’t know the sub-circuitry,” said Rinn. “We have found new wires on the circuit board.”
Rinn said that he and his fellow scientists were surprised by the finding that lincRNAs not only were required for reprogramming, but enhanced the process.
In fact, using lincRNAs increased the success rates of the reprogramming process up to eight times, compared to existing methods that do not use these molecules.
This finding may have significant implications for developing therapeutic interventions, Rinn said.
The next step, he said, is to study the progress in reverse and to understand lincRNAs’ role in facilitating cellular differentiation.
“[This work] has opened up a new area that needs to be explored for all sorts of other things that may unravel,” said Rinn.
The findings were published in the Nov. 7 issue of the journal Nature Genetics.

Bashir Bashir, an adjunct lecturer in the department of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Leila Farsakh, associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, proposed a binational solution to the conflict over the division of land that comprises Israel and its occupied territories during a talk at the Kennedy School of Government yesterday.
Bashir advocated for the idea of binationalism, in which one state recognizes both ethnic groups—Israeli Jews and Palestinians—co-existing, rather than the two-state solution that is most commonly proposed.
“It is our duty to think of alternatives,” he said. “We are seeking inclusion rather than apartheid.”
Farsakh began the talk by presenting a history of the discourse surrounding the partition of Israeli land. Since the UN General Assembly’s affirmative vote on the Palestine Partition Plan of 1947, “the leadership has functioned in the statehood paradigm,” said Farsakh.
She said that political leaders do not have the will to create a two-state solution. According to Farsakh, their inaction has created more problems within the state, and they need to shift their framework of thinking in order for advancements to occur.
Bashir proposed that such advancement would happen with a binational state. In a state where lines are not drawn in ethnic terms, both parties will have collective rights along with state recognition, he said.
“The binational alternative is feasible and morally desirable,” he said.
He added that neither Palestinians nor Israelis would have to give up anything in favor of this solution, and their identities and ethnic rights would be preserved.
Despite the perceived optimism surrounding his partition plan, audience members questioned the practicality of his ideas.
In response to a question regarding feasibility, he said, “reality is posing some substantial problems.”
Jean M. Entine, a board member of Jewish Voice for Peace, said the intellectual discourse surrounding the desire to find a resolution to the conflict makes her hopeful that a compromise can be reached. But, regarding a feasible solution, she said, “I don’t think I’ve heard it yet.”
Bashir remained hopeful that politicians would support the idea of binationalism.
“We need to go beyond intellectualizing this issue. This discourse needs to go down to political activism,” he said.
He also said he hoped his talk would expose more people to an alternative solution.
“There is a desperate need to expose a larger audience to thinking outside the box,” he said.

Professor Charles Fried and his son and Gregory answered a volley of questions on topics addressed in their new book, “Because It Is Wrong: Torture, Privacy and Presidential Power in the Age of Terror,” from a panel of Harvard professors yesterday.
The book argues that torture is never acceptable under any circumstances. The authors address issues of torture and wiretapping specifically through the lens of policies enacted by the administration of President George W. Bush. Charles Fried is a Harvard Law Professor and former United States Solicitor General, and Gregory Fried ’83, is chair of the philosophy department at Suffolk University.
The event was part of a series of “20 Questions” forums hosted by the Humanities Center at Harvard, during which professors ask questions of the speakers, followed by audience questions. A bottle of liquor called the “Humanitini” is given to the person who asks the twentieth question.
The father and son duo said that torture is wrong because it fails to uphold human dignity.
By torturing and destroying the dignity of one, they argued, we undermine the dignity of all humans.
“Torture is a denial of the respect and reverence that people owe to each other,” Charles Fried said.
They also argued that torture is an action not befitting a free, democratic republic. “Torture is a habit completely inimical to the habits of free democracies,” Gregory Fried said.
One topic the questioners and speakers touched upon frequently was the idea of prosecution of those officials responsible for torture. While Gregory Fried said he supports prosecution of torturers, Charles Fried said he did not totally support it, although he did say the current administration was wrong for not denouncing the last administration’s actions.
Some audience members said they agreed with the Frieds’ perspective.
“I would have liked to see more pursuit of the question of prosecution, not just of Bush, but also of some of the minor characters, like John Yoo,” said Bentley University Associate Professor of English and Media Studies Samir Dayal, who attended the event.
Joining the Frieds onstage as moderator was Professor Homi K. Bhabha. The questioners included Harvard Professors Nancy F. Cott, Thomas M. Scanlon Jr., Elaine Scarry, Carol S. Steiker ’82 and University Advisor on Human Rights Education Jacqueline Bhabha.
Past “20 Questions” events have featured University President Drew G. Faust and Professor of Government Michael J. Sandel, among others.

A man was the victim of an attempted armed robbery on Massachusetts Avenue near Sacramento Street right outside of the Dudley Co-op on Saturday at 12:45 a.m., according to the Cambridge Police Department.
The victim, a resident of Erie Street near MIT, was not a Harvard affiliate, according to e-mails from Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano and Cambridge Police Department spokesman Daniel M. Riviello.
According to Riviello, two suspects approached the victim and asked for his money. When the victim said that he did not have any, the suspects “sliced him twice in the face” with a pocket knife before fleeing the scene.
After the robbery, the victim went to a friend’s house before taking a taxi to a hospital, the name of which Riviello declined to disclose.
“After consulting with CPD, we made a determination that there was not a continuing threat to the community, hence no advisory,” Catalano wrote in reference to why a community advisory has not been released.
This was the fourth armed robbery close to the Harvard campus in just over a week. Last Tuesday night, a Somerville resident was robbed on Shepard Street near Walker Street, right outside of the Quad. A day earlier, two Harvard affiliates were robbed at knifepoint separately in the vicinity of Kirkland and Irving Streets and Harvard Divinity School.
While the Cambridge Police Department believed the first three robberies were committed by the same two suspects, they do not think the most recent crime is connected to the series of robberies that has taken place over the past few weeks.
“We have no reason to believe that this [most recent] incident is related to the string of recent street robberies in Cambridge as one suspect in those incidents is currently in custody,” Riviello wrote.

As a slide show of African-American history rolled in the background, images of slavery, beatings, and homelessness enhanced a vocal performance by Larry Watson about continuing social injustice last night in Ames Courtroom at Harvard Law School.
Watson’s performance supplemented a panel discussion titled “An Evening with the Cast of The Wire”—featuring actors Michael K. Williams and Jamie Hector, as well as Baltimore resident Donnie Andrews, and Dorchester-based activist Reverend Eugene F. Rivers ’83—intended to introduce Law Professor Charles J. Ogletree’s new spring course on urban poverty, which will draw heavily on the television series “The Wire.”
The course, Race and Justice: The Wire, will analyze the causes of urban poverty and how effective city governments and police departments have been in combating it.
Professor William Julius Wilson, who teaches an African and African American Studies course on The Wire for undergraduates, said he chose to analyze the show because it “integrates the range of topics necessary for a thorough understanding of urban inequality.”
Most of the discussion last night centered on the show, which premiered on HBO in 2002 and explored different facets of social strife in Baltimore, Maryland.
Andrews, the real life inspiration for a character who robs gang members, said that the series actually downplayed the constant struggles he faced. “What you see on ‘The Wire,’ you add that up three-fold,” Andrews said. “What you see is watered down.”
Audience member Setareh J. Yelle, a student at Simmons College, said that she appreciated the show’s realism. “I think that realism wouldn’t be possible without a cast that truly understands the issues that are affecting the city,” she said.
Ogletree said he hoped the course would provide a “rich and nourishing exercise to see what effect ‘The Wire’ has had on our communities.”

Joining a chain of Harvard alumni stretching back 220 years, 48 seniors were elected yesterday to the academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa.
The newly selected students, known as the “Senior 48,” will be honored at a ceremony in December and will be officially inducted into the society in May, along with 24 other members of the Class of 2011 who were elected last spring. About 96 additional members of the senior class will be chosen this spring in the final round of acceptances.
Seniors whose grade point averages were the highest in each academic division were invited in October to apply for inclusion in the society. Applicants, who were then judged based on their transcripts and a letter of recommendation from a professor, were notified yesterday of their acceptance or rejection.
"I've truly enjoyed the work I've done, and it's an honor to get this recognition," said honoree Alexandra M. T. Lu ’11, a Social Studies concentrator.
Two of Lu’s blockmates, Kevin Liu ’11 and Nicolas J. Roth ’11, were also among those elected yesterday.
Roth, who said that his GPA is 3.98, said that the distinction of being a member of Phi Beta Kappa “makes [his GPA] mean sort of a little bit more than a number on paper.”
An joint concentrator in Sanskrit and Indian Studies and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations who enjoys reading texts in Arabic, Hindi, and Urdu, Roth said, “My interest has always been very academic.”
“I view this award not so much as a personal achievement but as a reflection of all the academic support I’ve received over the years from parents, teachers, and friends,” said honoree Johnny H. Hu ’11, who concentrates in Chemical and Physical Biology. “They have given me an environment in which to do well.”
The 48 elected seniors are Samuel J. Barr, Grace K. Baumgartner, Peter J. Bernard, Keru Cai, Eric S. Dong, Davida Fernandez-Barkan, Courtney A. Fiske, Zachary M. Frankel, David B. Gootenberg, Sarah J. Hallett, Tess M. Hellgren, Johnny H. Hu, Joseph M. Jampel, Cameron D. Kirk-Giannini, Jennifer N. Kurdyla, Richard L. Kwant, Daniel E. Lage, Benjamin A.

Nietzsche, Weber, and former Harvard faculty members are among many thinkers who led Barack Obama to favor debates and compromises in his policy making in Washington, History Professor James T. Kloppenberg said last night in Boylston Hall.
According to Kloppenberg, the work of scholars such as Clifford J. Geertz, who earned his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1956, and John B. Rawls, a former professor of philosophy at Harvard, brought Obama to recognize that there is no universal truth, and that the best way to approach politics is to attempt to reconcile various points of view.
Kloppenberg presented his new book, “Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Political Tradition,” as part of the Harvard Writers at Work Lecture Series organized by the College’s Writing Program.
To write his book, Kloppenberg interviewed, among others, former colleagues and teachers of Obama at Columbia and Harvard. He studied Obama’s writings and examined the material he taught when he was a professor at the University of Chicago.
“His course syllabi are fascinating,” Kloppenberg said, explaining that as a law professor Obama encouraged his students to read authors such as Nietzsche and Weber. He would then ask them to use the social theories they had read about to try to come up with different ways of thinking about cases, Kloppenberg said.
“He was encouraging his students not to explore just one point of view but to see all the different arguments in a legal controversy,” Kloppenberg said.
Even though he was writing a book about Obama, Kloppenberg chose not to interview the President.
Kloppenberg said Obama would probably have to deny many of the book’s claims about his aversions to absolutes, adding that it would put Obama in an uncomfortable political position if he admitted the influence many works had on him.
Emma S. Winer ’09, who attended the event, said she was enrolled in Kloppenberg’s class when Obama’s popularity began to rise. She said she thought it was interesting to see how what had been discussed about Obama’s pragmatism in class was now translating into reality.
According to Kloppenberg, last week’s midterm elections’ results and Obama’s recent drop in popularity can be attributed to his penchant for discussion and compromises.
“He, unlike true-believing conservative and radicals, doesn’t think he has the truth. He thinks the truth will emerge from continuing conversations and experiments in policy,” Kloppenberg said. He added that this taste for compromises is often interpreted as a lack of leadership by the American population.
“It can be a frustrating, but that’s the way democracy works,” Kloppenberg concluded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A member of the Phoenix S.K. Club—one of Harvard’s eight male final clubs—reported the club’s flag stolen last week, an act which the member who reported the crime speculated may be related to the clubs’ recruitment season, or its recent wave of publicity from being featured in “The Social Network.”
The member told the Cambridge Police Department that he hung the flag on the pole outside the building, which is located on 72 Mount Auburn Street, at 1:30 a.m. on Monday. Its disappearance was noticed around 3:00 p.m., according to the police report filed on Wednesday. The rope had been cut.
The member estimated the flag, which has a white Phoenix on a solid black background, was valued between $400 and $500.
According to the club member who reported the theft, whose name was redacted in the police report, the theft may be related to the final club’s prominence in the film “The Social Network,” since Eduardo L. Saverin ’05, the co-founder of Facebook and one of the main characters, was a member of the Phoenix.
In “The Social Network,” Mark E. Zuckerberg, a former member of the class of 2006, was jealous of Saverin’s membership in the Phoenix. The film portrays Saverin attempting to join the Phoenix and shows parties taking place at the club.
Even though the filming was done at the Spee Club, and not the Phoenix, the publicity of the Phoenix may have prompted someone to steal the club flag as a souvenir or Halloween prank, according to the police report.
Another possible reason for the theft is that the Phoenix, as well as the seven other male final clubs and five female final clubs, were recruiting members. The recruitment, commonly referred to as “punch,” ended in the early morning of Nov. 1 when new members were notified of their acceptance.
The theft of the flag may have been “associated with these recruitment activities,” according to the police report. The club member who reported the theft did not want to blame any specific clubs without further proof, the report said.
The president of the Phoenix declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The journey started as a trip to the other land down under.
It ended with the US women's 8+ at the top of the world.
Winning both of its races with open water, the U.S. squad proved to be peerless at the World Rowing Championships in Lake Karapiro, New Zealand.
The U.S. women's heat-winning time of 6:00.52 was a little over a second faster than the 6:01.71 time Canada posted to win its heat. The narrowness between the two crews suggested a tense fight for the gold.
Instead the U.S. took the lead in the first 500 and never looked back. The Canadians were able to stay within a second of the U.S. for the first 1000, but the U.S. used its superior stamina to walk on its continental neighbors in the third 500, finishing that frame with a lead of nearly four seconds, a margin that the U.S. would hold to the finish.
The race gave Radcliffe alum and U.S. five-seat Esther Lofgren '07-'09 her first senior world championship.
Follow the jump to read more about the men's events.
MEN'S 4-
Henrik Rummel '09 may not have added another gold to his already-full trophy case, but the former Harvard rower still proved himself to be among the world's best.
Competing in the 4- for the U.S. men's national team, Rummel placed fifth in the A final. The straight four qualified for the A Final by route of a win in the Repechage, in which the U.S. beat the Italian entry by less than a second.
In the finals, the U.S. once again beat the Italian squad, this time by almost six seconds.
France took gold in the event.
MEN'S 1x
The top Crimson alum heading into the World Championships, Canadian Malcolm Howard '05 was the only one not to make the A Final. The 2008 Gold Medalist finished fifth in the C Final in a time of 7:22.19.
Howard was relegated to the C Final following a fifth place finish in heats and a fourth place finish in the Repechage.
It was a disappointing trip for a rower who was seemingly invincible rowing in eights. But with the London Olympics two years away, Howard has plenty of time to perfect his skills in the single—or to return to his old trade, the 8+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its most important regattas of the fall season scheduled for next weekend, the Harvard sailing team took a break from its normal fleet-racing competition to participate in team racing this past weekend. Team racing is a format of racing in which three boats from each school compete and a school’s cumulative score is added up to determine the winner.
“Team racing is more prevalent in the spring,” senior skipper Colin Santangelo said, “but we used the two regattas this weekend to get people ready for the spring and to just get in the mindset. Team racing is all about how well a team competes together, and it is about being able to both slow down your opponents and help your teammates.”
The Crimson co-eds sent two groups out on the water over the weekend, and each brought home similar results. One squad claimed fourth place at the Hap Moore Trophy Team Race at Coast Guard, while the other finished fourth at the Michael Horn Trophy hosted by Harvard on the Charles River.
“It was nice to get some team-racing practice in early this weekend,” Santangelo said, “as it is a lot better to make mistakes now than in the spring.”
HAP MOORE TROPHY TEAM RACE
Harvard had its top group of sailors finish fourth at the Hap Moore Trophy Team Race over the weekend. The event was hosted by Coast Guard on the Thames River, which provided the 12-team field with some great racing conditions.
“We were hoping to do a little better than fourth,” senior skipper John Stokes said, “as we have been having a good fall and are a pretty deep team, which is important for team racing.”
The Crimson were represented by a trio of seniors as skippers, co-captain Tedd Himler, Alan Palmer, and John Stokes, along with third-year skipper Brendan Kopp. Three juniors, Marie Appel, Quincy Bock, and William White, who is also a Crimson news editor, and sophomore Alma Lafler took care of the crewing duties for Harvard over the weekend.
“There are some races we would like to have back” Stokes said, “but it was an alright effort overall. We really only started to practice team racing last week and will focus more on it in the spring.”
MICHAEL HORN TROPHY
The Crimson co-ed squad also had a contingent stay close to home this past weekend and finish fourth out of five teams at the Michael Horn Trophy on the Charles River. Fellow Ancient Eight member, Brown, took home the top team honors at the Harvard-hosted regatta.
“We had more experience last year and were able to win this event,” Santangelo said, “but I think we competed well this year and showed that we are able to compete at the top level of team racing.”
Santangelo was the lone senior representing the Crimson at this event over the weekend, while co-captain Emily Lambert and Alex Jumper served as the only third-years competing for Harvard.
Ryan Byrne and Sarah McCuskee paired up as the only Crimson sophomores competing at the event, while freshmen Caitlin Watson, Louisa French, Morgan Russom, Isabel Ruane, and Margaret Fulham rounded out the competitors for Harvard.
“Morgan did a great job out there competing in her first team race as a freshman,” Santangelo said. “Her performance bodes well for the future of this team.”
With the only team racing regattas of the fall season now complete, the Crimson turns its attention to the Atlantic Coast Championships, the most important regatta of the fall, next weekend.
“Harvard is currently ranked first in New England,” Santangelo said, “but ACC’s will give us a good chance to compete against some of the best schools from other divisions and see how we stack up nationally.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the prime benefits of playing fantasy football is the exposure to emerging players throughout the National Football League. Any dedicated sports fan might be able to list off the rookies, injuries and upsets relevant to his/her preferred team, but dedicating time to a fantasy league develops a broader understanding of the game, the players and their statistics.
(Let’s not talk about the disadvantages of fantasy football, which is just about as addicting and dangerous for your social life as Four Loko.)
My Saturday night activities aside, one rising player affiliated with a team to which I have no ties comes to mind. Tracking Yahoo! draft trends and staying up-to-date on Michael “PETA Pal” Vick’s injuries have yet to translate into a post-graduate job (big deal) for me, but playing fantasy football did direct my attention to the rise of Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.
No longer is it only Harvard’s closet sports fans cheering on the Bills’ QB and 2005 Ivy League Player of the Year, but sports nerds throughout the nation.
Fitzpatrick first turned some heads this season after stepping in for an ailing Trent Edwards in Week 3 against the Patriots, nearly upending the division rivals with 247 yards and two touchdowns in a 38-30 loss. Going 5-0 in touchdowns to interceptions over the next two winless (and Edward-less) weeks, Fitzpatrick elicited more notice in Week 7 when he delivered the most touchdown passes (4) against the Baltimore Ravens since Peyton Manning’s riotous December 2007 performance. Despite Fitzy’s 382 yards and four TD’s, an overtime mistake from tight end Shawn Nelson cost Fitzpatrick’s team the 37-34 loss. On Sunday, the first victory of the season seemed imminent until a fourth quarter interception (perhaps Fitzpatrick’s biggest mistake yet) set up the visiting Bears for the go-ahead score.
Okay, so you might sense a theme here: the Bills (0-8), as a team, are terrible.
In general, Buffalo is failing worse than Democratic House candidates did last Tuesday. The Bills’ D has coughed up more points (29.1) and rushing yards (178.2) per game than any other team in the league. And although the Bills’ offense (304.6 yards/game) isn’t exactly as menacing as House Minority Leader John Boehner, we cannot simply look to the team’s proverbial leader as the sole indicator for its outcomes despite mounting losses.
In fact, Fitzpatrick’s statistics of late suggest the opposite is true.
So far Fitzpatrick has produced an 85.8 passer rating for the year–just about average for the league but still ahead of nearly-certain Hall of Famers (Brett Favre, Donovan McNabb) and highly-touted young talent (Mark Sanchez). Over six games Buffalo’s former second-string QB passed for 13 scores and only seven interceptions. With upcoming matchups against the inexperienced Lions, disappointing Bengals and bizarre Browns, Fitzpatrick and the Bills might just win a game this season.
Wins and losses aside, Fitzpatrick’s ascension to a starting QB position in the NFL must be considered a success story relative to most other recent Harvard athletes turned pro.
Fitzpatrick has far exceeded his former gridiron go-to, Clifton Dawson ’07. Dawson, holder of the all-time Ivy League rushing record, left a storied career at Harvard end entered the NFL with limited success. After brief appearances on the Indianapolis Colts and Cincinnati Bengals, a season-ending injury led to Dawson’s most recent parting with the Houston Texans in 2009.
Moving to the NBA, Jeremy Lin ’10 currently faces the immense growing pains of adjusting to professional-grade competition. After leaving his own giant mark on the Ivy League, it is strange but nonetheless correct to call Lin a rookie, as the small guard appeared in only two games for the Golden State Warriors so far and contributes one point and 1.5 assists per game.
Relative to Lin, Dawson and the majority of Harvard athletes, Fitzpatrick’s accomplishments should be carefully traced in seasons to come. He may not be the next Drew Brees, but he is certainly worth a second look–regardless if you play fantasy football or not.
A good friend of mine and Buffalo native frequently (and correctly) reminds me, “It’s tough to be a Bills fan.”
After starting Fitzpatrick in fantasy football, though, I can say that it’s becoming very easy to be a Fitzpatrick fan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its loss against Dartmouth on Oct. 30, the Harvard women’s soccer team’s dreams of a third consecutive Ivy League title were effectively dashed. With nothing left on the line, it would have only been easy for the Crimson to see last Saturday’s matchup against Columbia—its conference finale—as an inconsequential game.
But that proved not to be the case, as co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh led her team to a conference victory for the last time in her career with a goal—her Ivy-League leading ninth goal of the season—in the second half of play.
With emotions running high for the players and fans, the seniors on the team took the field on Senior Day at Ohiri Field for what was their final home game in Harvard jerseys. The Lions, on the other hand, were eager to upstage the Crimson and rob Harvard’s seniors of a final home victory.
After accidentally gifting the Crimson with an own goal early in the first half, Columbia was determined to claw its way back. But by taking things into her own hands, the Harvard co-captain placed the game out of the Lions’ reach to lead her team to a 2-0 win.
In the 80th minute of play, junior forward Melanie Baskind threaded a pass from the midfield to the top of the box where the awaiting Sheeleigh slid down to blast a shot into the left portion of the net away from the Lion keeper. With Sheeleigh’s final career goal at Ohiri Field, the win was sealed for the Crimson.
“[The goal] felt really special,” Sheeleigh said. “It was the last game that we are going to play at Ohiri as a senior class, so it was just a really nice way to go out, especially with our parents and friends there…. Beating Columbia meant a lot to me and to the team, so I think that just to be a part of that was really awesome.”
In addition to her athletic aptitude, another skill of Sheeleigh’s that has caught the eye of countless individuals—including Harvard coach Ray Leone—was her ability to control her emotions and direct them towards her play.
“I think it was an emotional game for all the seniors,” Leone said. “I knew that a lot of memories were going through their heads while they were playing in the game, but I was really proud that Katherine was able to keep those emotions in check and play well.”
With her goal against Columbia, Sheeleigh secured her position at fifth on the Crimson’s all-time scoring list, a record that will only serve as a cherry on top of what has already become an illustrious career.
With two consecutive Ancient Eight titles, three All-Ivy First Team awards, and an Ivy League Rookie of the Year award already to her name, the Adams House resident ended last season as one of the most decorated players in the program’s history. And the performance of the Harvard co-captain this season has proven to be no different.
“For four years, Katherine has just been amazing,” Leone said. “She is such an incredible and competitive person. She has been determined since the first day that she got here, and she has never shied away from the highest level of competition. She gave everything that she had for the last four years.”
As the Ivy League’s goals and points season leader, Sheeleigh has been a tremendous asset to the Crimson. As a result, over the course of her athletic career, Sheeleigh has not only garnered the respect of numerous individuals in the Harvard and the Ancient Eight communities, she has also caught the eye of the NCAA. Earlier this year, Sheeleigh was nominated as a finalist for the 2010 Lowe’s Senior Class Award—a national award that honors one deserving Division-I senior student-athlete in each sport for their achievements during competition as well as in their collegiate community.
But despite all of these accolades, emotions, and memories from the past, Sheeleigh is only looking towards her final game in crimson at Fairfield on Thursday.
“I’m really excited for the next game where I can just have fun and just have a game where the pressure is off, and we can just play a game as a group of friends,” Sheeleigh said. “But at the same time, it is sad knowing that it will be the last time I will be putting on a Crimson jersey. But I’m glad that I can really look back and say that I’ve had the most amazing four years, and I realize that that is what matters the most.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten savvier—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
With two big weeks looming ahead of it, Harvard had every reason to look past Columbia last Saturday on the gridiron. But the Crimson showed up to play at Harvard Stadium, handing the Lions a 23-7 loss and frustrating Columbia coach Norries Wilson. Particularly irritating to the Lions’ head coach was the number of miscues in what could have otherwise been a close game. Wilson vents some of his disappointment in this week’s edition of Sound Off.
What Wilson said: “You’re going to tell the kid not to compete? It’s fourth and 10. He picked the ball off. I’m sure there’s some coach somewhere saying, ‘Hey, know the situation, and bat the ball down.’ So next time he gets a chance to pick a ball off, and he doesn’t know the situation, and he bats the ball down, and they score a touchdown if he does it on third down.”
What Wilson means: In perhaps the biggest turning point of the game, Harvard went for it on fourth and 10 in Columbia territory, and junior quarterback Collier Winters threw an interception to Lions defensive back Craig Hamilton. But senior receiver Mike Cook quickly stripped Hamilton, leading to a first-down fumble recovery for the Crimson. Here, Wilson is trying to be a supportive coach and support his playmaker in the secondary, but at the end of the day Hamilton’s mistake is inexcusable.
Last Saturday’s play marked the second week in a row that a defensive player picked off a pass on fourth down, with Harvard junior linebacker Bobby Schneider making the same error against Dartmouth a week before. On that play, Schneider didn’t even make it back to the original line of scrimmage, basically “losing yardage” on the pick. Coaches can preach competitiveness all they want, but at the end of the day, this is the Ivy League, and these most academic of defenders can probably do a decent job of distinguishing third and fourth down. Wilson may have been right to protect his athlete’s confidence, but it wouldn’t be a surprise if an assistant sidled up to Hamilton in the locker room and told him to bat down the next one.
What Wilson said: “The officials have a very hard job, and my job is to coach the football team. It’s their job to officiate the football game.”
What Wilson means: Ah, the classic response of a frustrated coach. In another crucial turnover for Columbia, receiver Kurt Williams hauled in a deep reception, only to have junior safety Jonathan Mason jar the ball loose with a colossal hit. Mason fell on the fumble to give Harvard possession, but some argued that Williams was down by contact.
But Wilson, who is in his fifth year at the helm of the Lions, is too smart to say anything inflammatory about the referees. This stock response didn’t even address the question, a perfect stonewalling that told the rest of the media, “I’m not saying another word about the play.”
Of course, Wilson probably had good reason to keep his opinions on the referees to himself—in this instance the receiver clearly fumbled the ball, and the reporter was just trying to get a spicy quote from an otherwise dull Lions performance.

An e-mail circulating the Kirkland House list reports that several students, and even Kirkland’s building manager, Resident Dean, and House Masters, were unfortunate victims of Kirland’s belatedly installed card access system, rendering them unable to enter the Dining Hall.
According to Kirkland’s building manager Scott Haywood, a private security consultant team conducted a review of House security this past summer, recommending that all House doors and dining hall entrances convert to card access.
For most Houses, the new card readers were installed during the summer; however, Kirkland was the last house to have all of its entry doors converted to card access. “We re-evaluated the security system and we didn’t have card access for the dining hall before,” said Haywood. According to the email, MAC System installers accidentally activated the system in Kirkland, prohibiting students from other Houses from entering the dining hall because the company had not yet installed Universal Door Clearance.
Universal Door Clearance was installed last Monday but Kirkland’s JCR card reader will continue to accept only Kirkland students’ IDs. In the past, Kirkland’s security guard locked the dining hall and JCR at midnight. Now, the lock will be automated and the automated door schedule will be modified to accommodate special events. Haywood said there have been “no more issues” so students need not worry about being locked out from Kirkland House.

While this year marks the 135th anniversary of The Game, it also marks Yale’s continuing tradition of poorly themed H-Y swag (remember last year’s mildly offensive but mostly bizzare "Sissy" tees?).
Displaying that famous blue background and white type, this year’s Yale T-shirt mocks Harvard through the lens of “The Social Network” by titling it "Harvard, the anti-social network." Clever, we must say (or not).
Designed by Yale’s Freshman Class Council, the shirts read on the back “because you don't get to Harvard without being a(n) ____” and encourages students to fill in the blank.
Yale gets brownie points for word play. But, we revoke those points in looking at the slogan of “The Social Network”—"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies." What are they trying to say? You can’t get to Harvard without being awesome/perfect/the best? We think so too. Keep the praise coming!
So, fellow Harvardians, prepare to rock far superior, better, and all around more clever Crimson apparel. There are already five designs available, and probably more in the making.
With only ten days left until The Game, we hope Yale has enough time to produce a shirt we can call fair competition.

Like some prophet of Holy Writ, Seth A. Riddley ’12 woke from his sleep early a few nights ago with a vision. It was not of angels climbing up and down ladders, or of cattle rising from the River Nile. It was something rather more modest, but equally inspired—the thought of Harvard students, strangers to each other but eager to meet new people, having lunch together. At 1 a.m. that night, after researching some website mechanics, Riddley created harvardlunch.com.
On the website, Harvard students who wish to make a new friend, or at least an interesting one-off lunch partner, may provide their name, house, and Harvard e-mail address. They will then be randomly paired with another user of the site, and the twain will receive each other’s names by email. The hope is that they will then arrange a lunch-date (“not romantic,” clarifies Riddley) with each other at a House dining hall.
The inspiration for Riddley came from the unfortunate fact that many students become so entrenched in their social groups by sophomore year—student organizations, or teams, or blocking groups—that they sometimes close themselves off from the opportunity to meet new people. A darn shame, says Riddley, as there are “so many awesome people at the College.” He does not fancy himself a nouveau Zuckerberg, and admits readily that his programming skills are scant. He invented HarvardLunch merely because he thinks it “would be cool to see who you might meet”.
Evidently, many others think so, too. Within hours of Riddley sending word of the website to his native Mather, it had quickly spread throughout the College, and over 50 students had submitted their names and received a name in return. Two of those randomly paired did happen to be boyfriend and girlfriend, but all was sorted quickly, and both received new lunch-buddies.
Our friends are nice. But ever wonder who else might be lurking out there, just as nice as they, and just as suitable a meal companion? Let us learn their names and their stories, over a cup of tomato-ravioli soup and a ranger cookie or five!

Can you feel it—it’s in the air at Harvard. The epic scenes that will be Harvard-Yale weekend quickly approach. Did you get your ticket?
According to Kurt K. Svoboda, the assistant director of athletics, over 5,000 undergrads claimed their free ticket that were distributed at the Murr Center, as well as various dining halls last week. That number was a significant increase over the 2008 game. The feedback from students was “extremely positive,” said Svoboda in an e-mailed statement. “Many were impressed at how little time it took to obtain their tickets.”
“The strong turnout speaks for itself as a successful venture. We look forward to everyone enjoying The Game on Nov. 20 and taking part in the history and pageantry of this great sports rivalry,” said Svoboda.
The tickets are anticipated to sell out by next weekend, so if you were one of the unlucky students who missed the deadline for the complimentary tickets, a limited number will be available for purchase at the athletic ticket office on a first-come, first-serve basis.
