After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Sunday, I arrived in Ballroom B of the Courtyard Marriott, where Hilltop, the local Christian church I attend, holds its weekly services. A congregation of about a hundred people squeeze together in a sterile, beige conference room to consider the character of the Divine. This two hour service begins with an hour of singing. Vocals are loud. There is dancing in the aisles. A few people kneel in corners, weeping tears of conviction and of joy. The music is a massive swell of harmony, cascading in waves from three vocalists, a violin, two guitars, a keyboard, a bass, and a drumset. The timbres are thick with warm, sustained tones, saturating the room. Synthesizers sustain long, formless pads in open chords. Guitars are adorned with echo, reverb, and compression effects. Reverb and compression effects are applied over the vocals and violin as well. There is never a moment of musical silence, only the swelling of an ever-present set of diatonic sonorities, shepherding listeners into spiritual encounters with the Lord.
The spiritual aspect of music has always been central to my personal experience as a listener and musician. Spirituality is a nebulous term that can mean different things for different people. The balance involved between emotion, intellect, symbolism, and physical sensation is one that has challenged and transformed me throughout my 21 years of life.
In tenth grade, a few friends invited me to a night of prayer and praise music at church. I had never been to one of these before. The vibe was similar to Hilltop church on a Sunday morning. I ran into a woman I had never met before. She asked to pray for me. With rock-concert loud music in the background, she laid her hands on my shoulders, leaned close to my left ear and prayed. She prayed that I would know God not just as a ruler, but also as a close friend. And though I had never told anyone, especially this stranger, just how deeply I resented myself because of my shy nature, non-athleticism, and pudgy physical appearance, she prayed specifically into this resentment, declaring how the Lord created me, and saw me with awe and wonder. In that moment I became very hot, as if a fire was very close to my body. I wept. We hugged. The music continued to swell and swirl. Leaving that night, amidst this powerful spiritual encounter, I decided I would become close with this God, who seemed to have an extraordinary power to deliver people from darkness.
I went weekly to these nights of praise music. I also studied scripture, sought out spiritual mentors, joined the praise music band, and even started my own. I had a strong sense that my life had a purpose, and that my experiences were ineffable and undeniably real. Leaving California for college, making new friends, and going to a new church recontextualized my experiences, taking me for a rollercoaster ride of confusion. I met religious and nonreligious people who had had powerful spiritual experiences like mine, completely outside of a Christian theology. I met Christians who had never had these experiences, and even thought them irrelevant, given that they were not particular to Christianity. The big question that loomed over me through this was, “Was that night in tenth grade real? Or was it just emotions?” I began to resent my spiritual background, feeling as though American-brand Christianity had fooled me, through hype and emotion, to ascribe to their lifestyle. For a time, emotions took a backseat in my spiritual journey, This bore some good fruit. I began to see the absolutely necessary importance of having an outward-facing, un-indulgent practice of religion, one that orients itself towards community, relationship and service to other people, not just the self. I gained perspective towards subjectivity, and how complicated it is to consider a God-of-the-universe when the act of universalizing beliefs and behaviors has such a tragic, hurtful, imperial history. Disempowering my emotional experiences from such a lofty, authorial position brought a lot of good to me, and the people around me with whom I shared my faith.
Emotion is real, and to discount it completely is to refuse an integral aspect to human identity. Music is emotional, yet are we to say it is meaningless if it can’t be intellectually explained? Even more so, how could I possibly understand that night in tenth grade the great breadth of thought surrounding God’s character? If I took to heart only that spiritual encounter six years ago and nothing else, indeed, I would be at a loss. It was emotion that struck me to the core that night, and it is what called me to a lifelong journey towards God, one full of both intellectual and emotional encounters.
I have been coming back to terms with the emotional side of living, understanding that even in a prestigious school like Harvard, intellect is empty if it cannot invite in the experiences that surpass our current human understanding. The value given to emotion, intellect, symbolism, and physical sensation: these are balances that always differ among communities. Though that balance still fluctuates in me, I have confidence in what it was for me in those past seasons. Ultimately, the journey began with that woman’s prayer, reminding me that I was fearfully and wonderfully made. If such a word about my identity is true, than those balances of emotion and intellect that shaped me are not ones I have to refuse.

When we consider what the components of music are, the answer we often give is melody, harmony, and rhythm. However, it’s apparent that these means of description are not useful for all types of music. In the case of Sam Smith’s “Too Good at Goodbyes,” the chordal harmony is actually a banal feature of the music. It is more illuminating to point out the track’s gospel chorus feature, jaded lyrics, and the cathedral-like reverberations that bloom around Smith’s voice as he lets out long, high notes. Acoustical reverberation, or “reverb,” is a component to this Smith track that is particularly worth noticing as a listener. Before recording technology advanced to its modern capability, the acoustics of a piece of music would be fixed to whatever space it was performed in. With the modern capabilities of processing audio through a digital reverb software, however, producers are able to modulate the “space” surrounding the music just as flexibly as they may choose melodies, harmonies, instrumentation, and lyrics. Such a tool allows reverb to form the musical narrative of a song. In Smith’s “Too Good at Goodbyes,” the expanding and contracting of reverb from section to section amplifies the track’s themes of loneliness and relationship, as well as the lines between sacred and secular.
Reverb is a physical phenomenon present in all spaces. When a sound is emitted, like when somebody claps in a large empty room, the sound of the clap travels all around the space, bouncing off of the walls, ceiling and floor, until its energy dissipates. When you hear that clap, you are receiving the sound waves once directly from the colliding hands, a second time from sound waves that bounce from one surface of the room and then to your ear, a third time bouncing from surface to other surface to ear, and so on. This is why a large room carries a longer reverberation of the voice than a small room. The sound waves take longer to travel from surface to surface to ear drum. Physiologically, this is one way the human body is led by the ear. We enter a space, and by hearing any sound inside it, we comprehend the nature of the space, its size, material, even how crowded it is. Poetically, it is powerful to understand how the environment we inhabit literally takes part in amplifying and silencing certain voices.
In Smith’s “Too Good at Goodbyes,” the presence of reverb swells with the energy of the lyrics and density of instrumentation. The song opens with a lonely pairing of a piano and Smith’s voice. I picture Smith standing very closely in front of me, his quiet voice singing into my ear. No reverberations are heard, only sound directly entering my eardrum. The entrances of finger-snaps and a cello in the pre-chorus recalibrate my imagined listening space. It becomes a little bit larger, making space for the person playing the cello. Notice Smith’s treatment of the word “mean” here. He gives it a slight volume swell, very slightly activating a larger acoustic reverberation, foreshadowing the expansiveness to come. As Smith leads into the chorus, jumping to the upper octave of his range, a bass enters as well, expanding the low register of the frequency space. Reverb blooms around Smith’s voice. This sense of a soaring vocal, paired with the lowness of the bass, dramatically expands my imagined frame of listening. We are no longer in a small room, but something much larger and reverberant. The chorus climaxes with Smith’s title drop: “I’m way too good at goodbyes.” Simultaneously, a gospel choir enters with an orchestra, singing that same line, acting as human reverberators, echoing Smith’s words over and over again. What began as a small cocktail lounge of piano and solo voice has revealed itself to be a huge cathedral full of singing, musical bodies.
This reverb-trip engages my imagination not just in the physical realm, but also the poetic. Music with such instrumentation and reverb is most often heard for me in church. The gradual transition from a cocktail lounge piano bar to a cathedral full of gospel musicians prompts me to think about the boundary lines perceived between the “sacred” and “secular,” and how such a dichotomy is not so black-and-white for Smith. I find these themes present all over Smith’s music. The lyrics in his newest album speak on devotion, love, and disillusionment, often keeping the mode of address ambiguously fitting to either a romantic partner or a god.
When we hear a sound and its reverberations, we are also hearing the space that sound inhabits. In the case of Smith, that space is not just a large one. The physical expansiveness connotes themes of loneliness as well as of religious and romantic devotion. Chord sequences don’t convey such meaning. And as the relevance of classical music shrinks, the ability to perceive such harmonic activity becomes less relevant to experiencing pop music. Reverberation, however, is a physical phenomenon, felt by all. Its use in music production, as well as our perception of it as listeners, unlocks potential expressions where there were none before.

George S. Abrams ’57 is a Harvard alumnus and Crimson trustee who recently donated 330 Dutch Old Master drawings to the Harvard Art Museums. The Crimson spoke with Abrams to discuss his gift, his Dutch artwork experience, and his hopes for the field.
The Harvard Crimson: So a lot has been going on recently—you’ve just been knighted by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, correct?
George S. Abrams: Yes, there’s been a lot of activity in the last ten days. There was a dinner on Friday, where there were 150 people from all over. I was there, essentially, to make public that I was giving 330 additional pieces to the Harvard Art Museums. I surprised some people by the announcement, and they surprised me when the Dutch Consul General stood up and made me a knight.
But what’s important is that I gave an additional gift, which I felt Harvard was the appropriate place for. It’s 330 Dutch 17th century drawings to go along with the 140 that my wife and I had previously given in 1999. It’s a good home for art because Harvard has been the center of interest in Old Master drawings since the early 20th century in the United States. There are great scholars and teachers and curators—it’s one of the major places in the world for Old Master drawings.
THC: Tell me about the very first Dutch drawing you ever acquired.
GSA: My wife and I went to a little auction in Boston, where a drawing of an old man—a watercolor—was sold. It was by a Dutch artist named Dusart, and the piece was a lovely little caricature. I looked at it, and I studied it—and what amazed me was that this delicate work on paper had survived for over 350 years. It was in good shape. It seemed to me amazing that a little work could survive and be cherished by people for all those years. We acquired it—it wasn’t expensive—at that auction, and we still have it. That was the beginning of a number of drawings. We shortly thereafter went to Europe, and my wife and I went to many dealers and looked at drawings. And then we started studying. We went to libraries; we had a large library of our own. We began acquiring books to study. We went to the major museums in Europe. We built our library, and we slowly built our collection.
THC: So you still have that first piece?
GSA: Yes.
THC: Do you have any other pieces that you’ll never give away?
GSA:  Well, I have given away some drawings that I never thought I would, as part of the groups we gave to Harvard. There’s a problem in that you can’t take a drawing with you, so you have to find a good home for it. My wife died a number of years ago. I’ve been continuing to collect, but we’d been thinking about what a good home would be—and for Old Master drawings, Harvard is the place. It’s got the history, the tradition, the teachers, the collection. The students use it. It seemed to be the appropriate place to give most of our drawings. The total now is 140 plus 330 (or 470). I’ll give more, as time goes on. We’re trying to improve the group and add to it regularly.
THC: When you were collecting heavily, did you enjoy the daily process of acquiring art?
GSA: It’s a wonderful way to spend time. The chase for drawings and the looking—the whole process is an adventure. For the years my wife did it with me, we went off and had an adventure every time we went looking. Every time we went to Europe, we visited other collectors and went to auctions. It was just a very exciting thing. Not for everybody, but for us.
THC: What do you hope for the future study of Dutch artwork—what would you like to see in the field?
GSA: I think it’s a field that’s continually in the drawing area, producing new information about 17th century artists. There are scholars in Europe and the United States who are working now, every day, on interesting aspects of Dutch 17th century art. This Dutch period in the 17th century was a breakthrough change from prior activities. When the Dutch broke away from the Catholic Church, the artists were able—and did—turn to life around them: the people, the landscapes, the still lifes, the food, the events. And they drew about what they saw. That was a period when extraordinary geniuses sprang up and produced these wonderful works of art. Their paper had a magical spell to it. The period lasted for perhaps one hundred years, but it changed the way we perceive art. Somehow or other, these pieces of paper were loved and preserved by people over the centuries, and they were passed on. They come down to us today. That’s part of the excitement of collecting in the Old Master field.

“Theories,” presented by the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company, drew inspiration and guidance from scientific and sociological theories, connecting the written word with abstract movement. Directed by Gabe S. Martinez ’18 and produced by Sarah E. Coady ’19, the production embodied the essence of the liberal arts ideal.
HRMDC’s production incorporated technology and abstraction into the viewing experience from the get-go. The first visual on stage was a projection of falling snow made into a three-dimensional experience by the use of two layers of screens: one transparent and one opaque. The lighting design was also used to intensify the visual and emotional impact of the dances themselves; the location of the show at Farkas Hall made this possible. Coady remarked on how helpful the staff at Farkas proved to be for the show. “We’ve also been very fortunate to be working with John Malinowski, who is our lighting designer,” she said. Harvard’s Office for the Arts subsidized the hiring of Malinoski for “Theories.” The professional quality of the lighting design at the show was clear, with schemes shifting from apricot to sunset to crimson to deep blue and magenta hues.
All thirteen pieces were choreographed by a student with a particular theory in mind. “Each choreographer was given the opportunity to choose any scientific theory or sociological theory that they were interested in exploring through dance, so we were pretty hands-off on the process of that. Each piece is definitely each choreographer's own making,” said Martinez.
Each piece was prefaced by a brief introduction of the foundational theory. A montage of graphics illustrating the concept as well as the definition of the theory itself projected on the screen made for a clear communication of the idea that inspired the choreographer.
The show opened with “But What Do You Think?” created by guest choreographer Oona Wong-Danders. The piece played with the theory of collective effervescence (when a community comes together to simultaneously communicate the same thought). Wong-Danders depicted the act of coming together through teamwork and choreography that highlighted the physical dependence of the dancers on one another.
Following this piece was “On The Phenomenology of the Suburban Antiseptic” by Sunah Chang ’20, inspired by the theory of mob psychology and danced to a remixed version of Doris Day’s “Que Sera, Sera.” Chang’s piece spoke to the conformity in suburban America during the ‘50s and ‘60s. “I really wanted to explore that idea of how people find collectivity in strange and dangerous ways and lose their individuality in the process,” she said. Her dancers wore flowing dresses with floral patterns, reminiscent of suburban housewife outfits in the mid-twentieth century. While some of the pieces such as this one used costumes, many did not, placing the dancers in plain garments instead.
“Theories” maximized the space of Farkas Hall for an immersive experience. Dancers used the side aisles and ventured into the seating rows in several pieces, most prominently in “[ . k . i . k . i . ]” by Tiffany Y. Lau ’19.
“There’s some thematic overlap between theories,” said Martinez on the ideas upon which the pieces were based. “Theories” made these overlaps apparent using unconventional methods. What resulted was an uncommon perspective crafted by student choreographers that demonstrated a living relationship between scientific concepts and artistic expression.

Matthew Weiner’s debut novella “Heather, The Totality” is a book about an animalistic, all-consuming hunger. One of the book’s main characters is Bobby Klasky, a troubled kid who devolves into psychopathy. Weiner repeatedly describes how his eyes flash ravenously. His movements have a constant thrum of unhinged sexuality. In a scene after Bobby visits a prison psychologist, Weiner writes “What the Doctor said was all true to Bobby; he was so damn smart that people bored him and he was a bright light among them with all the power in heaven, and he could rape them and kill them anytime he wanted because that’s why they were on earth.”
“Heather, The Totality” is also a book about hunger’s suppression. The novella’s remaining protagonists are Mark and Karen Breakstone—a wealthy couple living in New York City with their daughter Heather (the “totality” of the title). The Breakstones are gratingly, painfully dull. They do not feel or act strongly. Anything resembling an emotion must be immediately repressed. The only light in their claustrophobic, isolated existence is Heather—the golden child, the picture of empathy and charisma. Weiner does not care to question Heather’s perfection: Despite her role as the title character, she is given no agency.  She is more object than subject.
The Breakstones’ one great mission in life is to preserve Heather’s childhood. If Heather is a desirable artifact, she is so primarily for her purity. Innocence, therefore, must be maintained at all costs. Mark Breakstone is shadowed by an earlier brush with teenage-girl maturation: his sister died of anorexia at age 17, in an attempt to literally suppress hunger. Heather, it is clear, will suffer no such fate. Weiner writes “Mark knew that unlike his Sister, who had starved to avoid breasts and menstruation and men, Heather would be a normal teenage girl, and that was no comfort either.” By having the audacity to age, to feel hunger of a more adult variety, Heather throws her parents’ illusions into doubt.
This is Weiner’s full cast: a deranged young man from a drug-torn background and a repressed family from New York City’s elite. They are hunger, felt and not felt. This fact is established within the first chapter. The remainder of the book, then, is a grueling, gripping death march towards the inescapable collision of Weiner’s plotlines. There is no chance of salvation; there is no hint of a happy ending. In “Heather,” Weiner has written a weird subversion of a noir thriller. The villains lurk solely within the protagonists. The “jump scares” occur when a character’s darker nature overcomes him—an event that Weiner renders unexpected and jarring. The question is not what will happen, but when, how, and above all, why.
In “Heather, The Totality,” Weiner’s writing style is terse and minimalist. With only 145 pages to work with, Weiner lets the reader’s imagination fill in the gaps. There is no dialogue. The author—who created the TV show “Mad Men”—takes much the same approach in print form that he has in TV: His work is founded on the belief that if you just stare at something long enough, it will start to get weird. “Heather, The Totality” reads like the countless “Mad Men” scenes where Jon Hamm stares ambiguously off into the horizon. “What is he thinking?” Weiner seems to demand. Similarly, what is going on inside the blank-faced characters of “Heather, The Totality?” True to form, Weiner isn’t spilling easy answers. In light of a recent sexual harassment allegation, such ambiguity may reflect badly on his character; as a literary technique, it will likely prove polarizing. Weiner lets suspense build in the spaces between the book’s controlled vignettes. There is always something dark and primal just around the corner, waiting to come out of the subtext and pounce.
And oh, does it pounce. Weiner writes of Bobby, “His urges had been denied so long that they now grew into a low hum of need, constant in his body like a spring was being stretched through his limbs.” Such animalistic desires—real desires, ones that Weiner does not belittle—must be felt. If they cannot be experienced normally, as in “Heather, The Totality,” then the ensuing explosion is as inevitable as it is wrenching. Weiner sets up an obvious dichotomy between the Breakstones and Bobby. They are of different classes. They are of different worlds. But everyone in “Heather” is governed by the same primality; everyone pulsates with the same hunger. The only remaining question is which hunger will prove stronger—and, as Weiner concludes his strange and compelling debut, the ending feels exactly as it should be. Weiner’s answer is definitive. The result is “Heather, the Totality,” in its totality: a noir bildungsroman with a statement to make about class, objectification, and what it means to grow up.

“... Ready For It?”, the first song on Taylor Swift’s new album “Reputation,” leads an album that is much less aggressive than such a dramatic manifestation of her cyber-punk fantasies would suggest. It’s jarring to listen to her attempt this soft-rap, spoken-word performance, especially when compared to the guitar-wringing love ballads of yesteryear. Since her self-titled debut in 2006, Swift has transformed from America’s girl-next-door to a woman scorned, hashing out her discontent in pure pop. And in those eleven years, she’s been peppered with scandal after scandal, from a feud in which Kanye West referred to her as a “bitch” in his song “Famous,” to her recent legal confrontation with a blogger over an article that linked her to white supremacy.
It’s clear that these events are taking a toll on her carefully constructed narrative, something that manifests in “Reputation,” a 15-song letter to the scandal-watchers. Swift restlessly experiments with her sound in her latest album. There are its generic, electro-pop, dance-floor songs, with synthesizers thrumming, echoing, and splicing through pieces like “So it Goes…” or “Dancing With Our Hands Tied.” There are also songs made for hazy summer days, like “End Game,” a Future and Ed Sheeran collab with breathy R&B tones. Swift gets whimsical in “Gorgeous” and “This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” mediating the former with a triangle and the latter with her trademark snarkiness and a flighty melody. Swift also borrows from historically black music with moments of rap and gospel, raising an unanswered question of where boundaries are in music.
In its worst moments, Swift’s sixth album is a self-absorbed display of theatrics. But at its best, “Reputation” is breathlessly honest, a documentation of budding and faltering love against the backdrop of a burning limelight.
One of the first honest reckonings on “Reputation” is the dark and confessional “Don’t Blame Me.” She leans into the tempo with constant purpose, creating a sound that feels both violent and self-contained while singing about love’s extremities, and the paranoid undercurrent she lives through: “I would lose my mind / They say, ‘She's gone too far this time.’” It’s clear that dealing with the pressures of having a relationship under the public eye requires more than just rain metaphors and guitar-strumming. The heavier undertone of “Don’t Blame Me” is proof of that.
“Reputation” can also be interpreted as a full display of Swift’s spectrum of coping. Sometimes she’s unnervingly upbeat, doling out sarcastic pushbacks with a smirk like in “This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” when she sings “And here's to you / ‘Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do.” Swift then dissolves into exaggerated laughter. “I can't even say it with a straight face,” she adds. And sometimes, she’s unexpectedly vulnerable. In “Delicate,” she sings “My reputation's never been worse, so / You must like me for me…,” while her voice is run through a vocoder and split into threads. Swift’s reputation isn’t always touched upon in these songs, but that somehow makes the theme so much more compelling. It dots through the album, a constant, subtle reminder of the paranoia that comes with being such a high-profile musician.
“Reputation” swings from a self-aggrandizing rejection of blame to the complicated assessment of a relationship’s inevitable end. In cases like the lead single “Look What You Made Me Do,” the album falters because it feels shallow to the point of dishonesty. It’s solely rooted in its spite, and not much else. But then there are cases like “Getaway Car,” a song that is paradoxically both melancholic and fast-paced. It’s expertly textured with flaring beats straight from the ’80s and personal regret. It sounds like a song that belongs on “1989,” but this is less a case of “Old Taylor” versus “New Taylor” and more that when Swift is practicing her signature move—disclosing pieces of her heart to her audience—she shines brightest. When she moves into cliches, though, her writing grows clumsy, the prime example of this being “Gorgeous”: “You're so gorgeous / I can't say anything to your face / ’Cause look at your face.”
The perfect antithesis to this lazy songwriting—and the highlight of “Reputation”—would be “New Year’s Day.” It’s the only acoustic song on the album, and her voice is wonderfully bright and bare. “I want your midnights / But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day,” she quietly sings. This song is the last on the album—Swift has a habit of ending each one with an emotional punch. But it’s luminously soft and honest, as she remembers the candle wax on hardwood floors, the leftover glitter, and the girls holding their shoes in hand as they walk back home.
You can argue that Swift doesn’t have much to cope with—that at the end of the day, she still stands levels above everyone else in terms of power and wealth. Yet her problems are clearly urgent and real to her. “Reputation” tries to distill the aftermath of her feuds and drama into understandable terms. And while the album can be bogged down with self-indulgent snark and lazy songwriting, it glows brightly when Swift is herself.

“Up.” “Wall-E.” “Toy Story.” Without a doubt, Pixar’s animation quality, sound design, and attention to detail stands bar none. But beyond technical considerations, Pixar’s emotional intelligence and commitment to genuine storytelling make their productions transcend the realm of “wacky kid’s film” and become something more. They stand as memorable meditations on those experiences that have been explored in story for time immemorial— family, love, friendship—tropes which could easily make for a cheesy production in lesser talented hands. “Coco,” the latest addition to Pixar’s incredible repertoire, once again combines powerful storytelling, attention to detail, and technical mastery to deliver a memorable movie experience.
The film follows the story of Miguel, an aspiring musician who must deal with the conflict between the pursuit of his passion and the demands of his family. His interest in music provokes great opposition from his family, as his great-great grandfather abandoned his wife and young daughter to pursue a musical career. During an episode of family drama over whether he should participate in the town’s Dia de los Muertos music contest, Miguel is accidentally transported to the land of the dead, and so his adventure begins.
The tension between aspiration and familial duty is explored throughout the film through a variety of characters, each expressing different views on the matter. As the film progresses, Miguel’s perspective on the matter becomes more nuanced, and he hears compelling arguments on the merits of both tensions. Instead of offering a heavy-handed and definite “solution” to this moral quandary, Pixar presents a moderate solution, and ultimately allows the viewer to decide what they see as the right balance.
Though Pixar suggests a balance between personal ambition and domestic responsibilities, the film very forcefully portrays unchecked ambition in a negative light. The “do whatever it takes to succeed” mentality has been the subject of scorn in many Disney/Pixar movies before, and has arguably been tackled best in “The Lion King.” In “Coco,” this dynamic is explored with a little less tact and emotional nuance, but nevertheless succeeds as a cautionary portrayal.
Being a Pixar movie, the technical direction of “Coco” astounds. Minute details such as hair, flower petals, and guitar strings are delicately animated, with each fine detail visible. Lighting falls naturally, in a hue and dimension that is somehow faithful to and surpasses the way light falls in the real world. To portray Dia de los Muertos, the color palette for “Coco” pops out of the screen in hues of deep blue, bright pink, and brilliant purple. All this attention to detail and beauty makes “Coco” a treat to look at.
This dedication to accuracy extends beyond the technical. According to a July interview with co-director of the film Adrian Molina, Pixar employees travelled down to Mexico to experience Dia de Los Muertos and speak with those who celebrate the holiday in order to assure nuance and accuracy of portrayal.  From the marigold flowers, to the pan de muerto, to the ofrendas and more, the film makes a genuine effort to both faithfully portray the holiday and provide enough context so that audience members unfamiliar with Dia de Muertos may learn.
Beyond simply telling the beautiful story of a boy caught between family and ambition, “Coco” showcases the richness of a culture that has been all-too-maligned in recent years. More often than not in popular discourse, Mexican is equated with phrases such as “illegal” or “undocumented.” The actions of this current administration in particular have put the lives of many Mexican-Americans in jeopardy, and a productive discussion on immigration cannot occur if one side sees a group as more of a problem than a people. Popular media portrayals of Mexican and broader Latinx culture are one way to combat the ignorance and hate which has permeated American society, and “Coco” is a great contribution to that effort.
While “Coco” is by no means the best Pixar movie, its representation of, focus on, and care for a culture is admirable. It is worth mentioning that “Coco” came out on October 27th in Mexico, a full month earlier than in the US, and just in time for Dia de los Muertos. Movies like “Coco” move society closer to the day when a minority child can look up to the big screen and expect to see a hero that looks a lot like them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After long days running back and forth from classes to libraries, work, extracurriculars, and more, students should be able to return to a dorm room in which their identities don’t continue to be challenged. The transition to college often comes with more freedom to explore and express one’s own identity. Students should be supported by Harvard in the difficult process of finding housing that best meets their needs.
Although a push for gender-neutral housing is not a recent development, there is still a long way to go. While gender-neutral housing options are available in upperclassmen housing, this is an issue that affects the daily lives of first-year students as well. The College should ensure there is a well-rounded approach to supporting non-binary students on campus, as well as to making well-trained students accessible and approachable.
We do not believe that we have an answer for the best solution in terms of gender-neutral housing. However, we advise the administration to take proactive measures to reach out to students who are questioning gender or students who identify as transgender to offer housing options that would be best for them personally. We ask that they take into account that comfort level in housing can mean different things for different people. Instead of lumping people who request gender-neutral housing into just one category or one physical space, Harvard should make better efforts to offer many options to fit the requests of individual students.
We recognize that the housing questionnaire has limitations and non-binary students may be reluctant to share that on the questionnaire. It might be difficult for students to talk about gender identity so we ask that the administrative process to get the housing they need be less bureaucratic.
Nevertheless, we’re glad to see that Harvard has been grappling with these issues by having Yard Deans reach out to students and encourage them to look for solutions that specifically address the potential for student’s gender identity to change after that initial conversation takes place. Flexibility for housing should be available in such cases.
Lastly, we commend programs such as the First-Year Urban Program that give people a platform to discuss these ideas, bring them to the surface, and then allow the College to take them into consideration. Gender-neutral housing is made available through this pre-orientation program—even for freshmen. We would like to see Harvard as a whole taking initiative to do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A couple of years ago, in the golden age of answering the age-old query of “How are you?” with a dismissive “Fine” or an emphatic “Great!”, I challenged Harvard to ask a new question: “How are you, actually?” Since then, I’ve noticed my own development has been most profound when I’ve given myself permission to tussle with this difficult question.
However, eliciting an honest answer from others, especially without prying or prodding, has proven to be a trial in itself. There seems to be continued aversion to vulnerability on this campus—as if revealing our own struggles somehow makes us inadequate. In my personal experience, though, I’ve realized that I’ve connected most with others when I’ve been my most vulnerable, when I’ve been authentic in owning that things aren’t always easy, and that I could use some support.
Harvard is a goal-centric, high-achieving environment—one in which it feels intolerable to falter, for fear of what stumbling might mean about our characters and intrinsic worth. We constantly berate ourselves for tiny imperfections when we could instead connect with each other over the things that aren’t so easy. In our solo quests to be the greatest we can be, we lose sight of the actual experiences that will make us our best selves: connection, exchange, and honest interaction. We’ve woven a false narrative in our minds that our successes are measured by effusive descriptions to others of how well we’re doing.
This outlook is destructive because of the high premium it places on external validation and pretending that things are going better than they are. It’s time to tell ourselves a new story: the story that struggling is acceptable, and that our issues deserve to be heard.
Instead of going to war with ourselves, let’s work together to cherish our qualities, both good and bad. I’ve made the most progress when I’ve welcomed the things I don’t like about myself. I notice them. I acknowledge them. Then, I hug them closer, and accept that I have aspects that aren’t flawless. For example, I struggle to embrace how I can be uptight, especially when it comes to cancelled plans.  I used to stew over postponed dinner dates and called-off study breaks and turn my disappointment inwards.  I told myself that a friend’s decision to reschedule on me was somehow indicative of my being unworthy or undesirable. Eventually, I began to talk to others about my insecurities; only then was I able to combat the voice that undermined my self-esteem.
This isn’t easy, but it’s worth the work; reaching out to others to accept the love that will make us grow is much more impactful than speaking to ourselves in a judgmental and damaging way. The choice to present an edited version of ourselves to others rather than acknowledging and accepting our insecurities is alienating and secretive.  If we can’t offer our authentic selves in our day-to-day interactions, we can’t truly expect to engage meaningfully in any of our relationships.
Many of us are conditioned to strive to maximize our successes, and avoid any mention of things that didn’t go quite as planned.  This mindset can make the concept of talking about our struggles frightening. This calls for courage, though—not fearlessness.  I’m not telling you not to be afraid. I’m inviting you to notice the things that scare you the most, and do them anyway.
After all, we weren’t put on Earth to be stoic and detached. We were put here to let the world affect us, to allow life to crack us open and have an impact on us. When we live passionately, not apathetically, we make space for our most formative experiences.
These are the types of lifestyle choices that can transform Harvard’s campus. I believe that a true change in the type of environment that Harvard fosters will come only when we collectively decide to eschew the idea that “fine” is the baseline, and instead normalize an atmosphere where reaching out is the norm when times are hard.
Authenticity in acknowledging our shortcomings is, unfortunately, a revolutionary idea today. I challenge Harvard to join me in ascribing to the radical notion that we can love ourselves, own our faults, and still find fulfillment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, I visited San Francisco’s Castro District, one of the most famous queer neighborhoods in the world. While there, I stumbled upon the GLBT History Museum and spent the afternoon looking through the exhibits, completely enraptured in an unfamiliar history that somehow still felt like home.
LGBTQ+ people have existed for the entirety of human history; in the last few centuries, many have lived their lives unnoticed or forced to hide. Others who spoke out or lived openly faced discrimination, violence, and even death. Visiting this museum allowed me to get a closer look at this often unrecognized history. I gained a greater appreciation for the work that trailblazers did so that I, as well as future generations of LGBTQ+ people, can have an easier life in a more accepting society.
A key moment in LGBTQ+ history is the Stonewall protests in June 1969, which were a response to police raiding the Stonewall Inn, a gay club in Greenwich Village, New York City. Many people view the subsequent six days of protest as a major catalyst for the LGBTQ+ rights movement.
In 1977, Harvey Milk became one of the first openly gay people elected to public office in the United States.  He spent less than a year in office, as he was assassinated by Dan White in November 1978. In his will, Milk included his now famous wish: “If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.”
The AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s was devastating for the LGBTQ+ community. In response, organizations such as Act Up protested the US government’s inaction and hostility towards those infected with the then untreatable disease, most of whom were gay men.
A landmark Supreme Court case for LGBTQ+ equality was Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, which overturned anti-sodomy laws that only affected queer people. Exactly 12 years after Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that marriage is a constitutional right guaranteed to LGBTQ+ couples.
Our community has come a long way in our fight for equality, but we still have a long way to go. Many of the prejudices that fueled discriminatory laws and actions in the last century exist today, just in different forms. I’m thankful that society is more accepting today than it was before, but it’s far from perfect.
Fifty years after Stonewall, police harassment and brutality toward queer people, especially transgender people, are still a huge problem in our country. Twenty-two percent of transgender people who had interacted with police reported police harassment, and 6 percent reported that they experienced bias-motivated assault by officers. Black transgender people reported around double the rates of biased harassment and assault, at 38 percent and 15 percent respectively.
Forty years after Harvey Milk’s election, Andrea Jenkins just became the first openly transgender black woman elected to public office. While this is a historic win for our community, we can’t just celebrate and forget the continued violence against transgender women of color. In 2016 alone, 27 transgender people were murdered, most of whom were transgender women of color.
Thirty-five years after the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, more research still needs to be done on HIV/AIDS. Today, HIV is the third leading cause of death for black women, ages 25 to 44.
Fourteen years after Lawrence v. Texas, no one can be imprisoned for being gay, but queer people can be fired simply for being queer in 28 states, and 3 states even have laws prohibiting local anti-discrimination laws. There’s still no federal workplace anti-discrimination laws for LGBTQ+ people; instead, we have a patchwork of state laws that vary widely in their protections.
Two years after Obergefell v. Hodges, many think our fight for equality is over. While nationwide marriage equality was a huge win for our community, that wasn’t the end goal. We still face anti-transgender bathroom bills that would require people to use the bathroom that matches the sex listed on legal documentations. And even when we finally remove all possibility of these bathroom bills, there will still be another issue to address, another cause we must fight for, until all LGBTQ+ people gain true equality. This fight must center around intersectionality, as other forms of oppression like racism, sexism, classism, and ableism also harm LGBTQ+ people. True equality means the freedom for everyone in our community  to live lives free from all forms of oppression.
We can’t know where we’re going unless we know where we’ve been.  Sadly, a lot of LGBTQ+ history has been erased or ignored in favor of more mainstream, heteronormative, and cisnormative narratives of history, especially in school curriculums. Moreover, gentrification of historically queer neighborhoods is erasing physical spaces for queer communities to thrive.
What can we do? One way to help is visiting and supporting LGBTQ+ museums and archives around the world. You can also donate to organizations that preserve LGBTQ+ history, such as the GLBT Historical Society and the History Project in Boston. Another way to help is supporting the ongoing efforts to advance LGBTQ+ equality through organizations like GLAAD, Human Rights Campaign, The Trevor Project, and Lambda Legal.
Beyond financial support, get involved with activism. LGBTQ+ history is being made every day. Decades from now, future generations will look back at our present time and see the change we’ve created. There may even be museum exhibits on the groundbreaking work done in 2017. What role will you play in this? How will you help write LGBTQ+ history?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to gauge the stances of this year’s three Undergraduate Council presidential tickets campus-wide and national politics, a coalition of 28 “activist and identity-based” student organizations created a voter guide for the election.
The guide asks the presidential tickets 18 questions about their support for initiatives like gender-neutral housing for freshmen and more widespread wheelchair accessibility. It also shows their stances on recent Harvard policies, such as the sanctions on unrecognized social organizations—which, starting with the Class of 2021 bar students from holding campus leadership positions and receiving College endorsement for some fellowships—and Harvard’s legal appeal to the National Labor Relations Board’s decision to invalidate a 2016 student unionization election.
Noah R. Wagner '18, a member of the Harvard Trans Task Force—the group that originally crafted the idea for a voter guide—hopes to turn the attention of candidates and voters in the election toward concerns facing marginalized communities.
“This came initially out of conversations with Trans Task Force, which we quickly brought to the...other student groups,” Wagner said. “We felt that discussions around campus politics consistently neglect some of the concerns of marginalized communities and we wanted to change the conversation.”
On all but two of the 18 questions, the three tickets answered affirmatively, differing only on their stances on sanctions against Harvard's unrecognized social organizations and whether or not Harvard should drop its appeal to the NLRB.
Cabot House representative Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and UC Treasurer Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 broke with their two competitors by supporting penalties against single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations. The other two tickets did not support imposing these penalties.
On the issue of Harvard’s graduate student unionization appeal, two tickets—Dunster House representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 and Kirkland House resident Michael K. Bervell ’19 together with Zhang and Boucher—support calls for Harvard to drop its appeal to the NLRB. Mather House resident Conor Healy ’19 and Kirkland House representative Parth C. Thakker ’18-19 said they will not advocate for Harvard to drop the appeal.
Despite finding a “surprisingly widespread consensus,” Wagner said there is still value in a guide that reflects general agreement between all of the tickets.
“No matter who is elected the next UC president, we are now able to hold them accountable for those commitments, which we think is really valuable,” they said.
The voter guide will be distributed across House email lists. The UC recently agreed to fund $125 to pay for candy and campaign literature at voting booths within the houses. After some difficulties with the voting interface, voting commenced Monday and will end on Nov. 16 at noon.

Though Michael D. Smith said he was not aware of the possibility of his own candidacy to be Harvard’s president, he has spoken informally with members of the committee tasked with choosing the next president in his capacity as Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“I have no insider knowledge of what the search committee is doing,” Smith said. “I’m sure they’re looking at lots and lots of people.”
Last month, Michael T. Kerr ’81, one of the co-chairs of the Harvard College Fund Executive Committee who said he knows many search committee members “very well,” said Smith was one of the strongest internal candidates to replace University President Drew G. Faust when she steps down in June. The other possible internal candidates include Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Government professor Danielle S. Allen, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Smith said he has been in contact with members of the search committee, which consists of 12 members of the Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers.
“I have talked to members of the search committee when they’ve asked for my opinion about what qualities in a candidate and what opportunities face the institution and how might they think about identifying a fantastic next president for us,” Smith said.
Smith said he has not formally met with the faculty advisory committee for the presidential search, which includes five members of FAS and is chaired by Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin Kelsey.
Many alumni, donors and experts have said that dealing with the University’s finances will be a major task for the next President. As Dean of FAS, Smith has worked to fund major projects like undergraduate House renewal and the expansion of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus into Allston. Recently, Smith announced that he had restructured FAS’s debt to the University to allow for more financial flexibility in the coming years.
Smith said that he expects Harvard’s next president to have experience in financial management. He said that Faust’s efforts to stop various Congressional policy proposals, including a tax on endowment returns and cuts to federal research funding, is “an ongoing battle.”
“The next president is going to be facing the same set of questions because of the issues that we’re facing at the national level today,” he said.

Harvard will partner with the non-profit Service to School to assist U.S. combat veterans applying to higher education, partnering with a dozen other universities in the initiative.
The Service to School program, known as VetLink, gives veteran applicants an "enhanced opportunity to showcase their military experience" to prestigious universities interested in admitting them, according to its website. The program started in 2015 with six original university partners, including Yale University and Williams College, and its preliminary partnership with Harvard will last for three years.
Everett Spain, a colonel in the U.S. Army and professor at the United States Military Academy, and Thomas Reardon ’68, director of the Harvard Veterans Alumni Organization, announced the partnership at a Veterans Day ceremony in Memorial Church Saturday. 
“This new partnership boosts our efforts to bring to Harvard College military veterans with talent and records of achievement,” William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, the College’s dean of admissions and financial aid, told the University-run Gazette:
Service to School provides mentoring and free application assistance to veterans, and aims “to help veterans win admission to the best universities possible and to help them maximize their education benefits,” according to the non-profit’s website. 
While Harvard does not currently offer formal programs to assist its own incoming student veterans in their adjustment to university life, both Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—another VetLink partner—have previously collaborated with a non-profit known as the Warrior-Scholar Program to host academic “boot-camps” for veterans interested in attending college.
This move builds on Harvard’s previous commitments to the U.S. Armed Forces. Currently, Harvard trails only the United States Military Academy and the United States Naval Academy in the number of alumni who have won the Medal of Honor.
Last spring, University President Drew G. Faust welcomed back the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program to Harvard’s campus after cutting ties roughly 40 years prior during the Vietnam War. Faust also reaffirmed the Navy and Army ROTC programs in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Adams House staff have seen a decline in students’ use of two House party spaces—“the Molotov” and “K Space”—after a temporary ban on alcohol in the rooms went into effect this semester.
Adam Muri-Rosenthal, Adams's resident dean, said the new policy came after problems with the cleanliness of the spaces and a lack of clear expectations regarding the use and cleaning of the rooms.
“We have tried a number of different things to make those spaces useful for parties, and for a number of different reasons, it's proven more difficult than we expected, and the policies we've tried putting in place haven't really worked,” Muri-Rosenthal said.
He added that the ban seeks to encourage residents to still use the rooms, "but also in a way that respects the spaces."
The alcohol ban will not be permanent, but is intended to serve as a placeholder while Adams House staff work out a long-term plan, according to Muri-Rosenthal.
“What we decided to do was to put things on hold, allow students to continue to use the spaces just without alcohol while we figure out something that's more effective,” he said.
The Molotov, renovated in 2015, re-opened amidst a push to re-center social life in the Houses and away from private and off-campus social spaces. Following the popularity of the Molotov, the K Space opened, responding to ongoing student demand for more social spaces on campus. Both spaces have historically allowed alcohol consumption by students of legal drinking age.
Since the temporary policy has been in place, use of the two rooms has seen a decline, but Muri-Rosenthal said he hoped the rooms will become more popular again after the implementation of a permanent policy regarding alcohol consumption.
While administrators discuss a permanent solution, Adams residents have been left frustrated with the change. Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 said she was unable to throw a 21st birthday party for a friend in the Adams party spaces because of the temporary alcohol ban.
“I have spoken to a number of friends who have felt like it has limited our choices for how we can socialize,” she said.
Muri-Rosenthal said that the new policy regarding alcohol use is close to being completed and released to the Adams House community.  While he did not give an explicit date for the new policy, Muri-Rosenthal said that it will likely go into effect next semester.

As leaves fall from the trees and temperatures drop across Cambridge, Mass., Harvard students have begun to emerge in puffy coats and layers bundled against the colder weather.
“I generally wear around three to four jackets depending on if it’s raining or not. If it’s raining then I add another one,” Jasper W. Fu ’21 said. “I wear two pairs of socks with my boots unless all my socks are in the laundry.”
For many Harvard freshman from warmer climes, this will mark the first time they see snow or experience temperatures below freezing.
Raissa Chughtai ’21, who is from Pakistan, said she recently ordered a winter coat. She said she wants to be prepared for the lower temperatures and all the snow to come in future months.
“Mentally, I knew it was going to happen, but physically, I was not prepared for it,” Chughtai said. “I even got some boots now after it got so cold.”
The lowest recorded temperature in Cambridge so far this school year occurred last Saturday, when the temperature dropped to 23 degrees. But the weekend was downright balmy compared to three years ago, when Harvard made the rare decision to cancel classes three times after historic blizzards.
Hawaii native Case McKinley ’21 said he is adjusting to the new climate, but misses the beaches of his home island.
“I was under the impression that wearing a jacket made you not as cold, but it’s not true. It still sucks,” McKinley said. “I miss the sun too. It’s harder to be as happy without it.”
As autumn continues, the change in weather is a shock to the systems of many students from warmer climates. But some, like Paul J. Yanez ’20 of California, aren't bothered: “It’s not bad. I’m used to it from last year,” Yanez said. “I kind of like the cold. The worst part is the lack of sunlight."
The College’s Financial Aid Office administers a Winter Coat Fund to qualifying low-income students through the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote an email to students eligible for the grant in late October informing them about the opportunity.
“The late Clara B. Kimball made a generous gift to Harvard to help students with financial needs that were not covered by ordinary aid,” Khurana wrote. “With winter fast approaching, I am pleased to inform you that you will be receiving a grant from the Bertram Kimball Fund to help you stock up on necessary items to keep you warm in the months ahead.”

UPDATED: November 15, 2017 at 4:49 p.m.
Members of Harvard’s new "Table Talk" initiative spent upwards of an hour in extensive conversations sparked by the question "how are you?" Monday evening.
Founded by students at Emory University, Table Talk is an initiative with branches at several colleges whose mission is to bring people together in innovative ways, according to the group’s website.
Amitai B. Abouzaglo ’20, one of the founders of Table Talk at Harvard, explained that he and Salma Abdelrahman ’20 started the chapter last year in the wake of the divisive presidential election, seeking to foster camaraderie on campus.
“We were thinking about this idea for giving people spaces for listening to one another and converging on shared interests and having a space where people could feel welcomed,” Abouzaglo said in an interview.
On Monday night, the topics ranged from the best time of day to take naps to a lack of fulfilling interpersonal relationships on campus, with freshmen and returning members mixed together around square tables.
Last spring, the group held two social functions that, like Monday’s event, were designed for students to engage in substantive dialogue. They focused on transitioning from home to campus and was hosted in partnership learning to cope with Harvard’s high-stress environment.
“How are you?” was Table Talk’s first event of this school year. Abouzaglo said it was designed to open up the way students address each other, breaking the “icy” barrier between students on a campus where an “atmosphere of doing” permeates everyday life.
“When you're rushing from one place to the next, you can't get a real conversation in,” he said.
Students ate pizza in the Memorial Church Oasis as Abouzaglo and his co-organizer Shireen Younus ’20 moved from table to table, joining small groups and taking in the conversations. Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis also participated in one of the discussions.
Younus, an active Crimson editorial editor, said that the deep, meaningful conversations at events like “How are you?” show that Table Talk is accomplishing its mission.
“You can see that we have a really specific framework on how we want to achieve this,” Younus said. “It is very simple, it is really doable: bringing people together around a meal, around food, around a table, to talk about something that matters to them.”
In the future, Abouzaglo says he aims to spread Table Talk’s initiatives across campus and unite students, faculty, and offices that share similar goals with the organization. Specifically, he hopes that Table Talk can form a strong collaborative relationship with the Freshman Dean’s Office, a process that Table Talk organizers say they have already begun.
For now, they are starting with a simple introduction. One participant, Alden E.J. Fossett ’21, said the conversations on Monday night were both enjoyable and constructive.
“I think that it’s a great idea, and I’m happy to support Amitai in his endeavors to create a more inclusive social space at Harvard,” Fossett said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 15, 2017
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that Table Talk was founded at the University of Pennsylvania. In fact, it was founded at Emory University.

UPDATED: November 14, 2017 at 2:42 p.m.
Taxes for Harvard graduate students could increase almost four-fold under a Republican tax plan presented in the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month, according to a tax law expert.
The recently-proposed House tax reform bill repeals the tax-exempt status of  the “qualified tuition reduction”—tuition lowered by a university for its employees and paid graduate students.
Harvard currently provides full tuition support to all Ph.D. students and some Master’s students, giving roughly $45,000 per year to each student, though that amount decreases to roughly $12,000 after the first two years of a Ph.D program. Depending on how the House proposal is interpreted, these tuition grants could be counted along with graduate students’ stipends as taxable income, a change which would push students into a higher tax bracket.
Patrick W. Thomas, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, wrote in an email that Harvard graduate students earning a typical stipend of roughly $35,000 could see their federal income taxes increase almost four-fold—from around $3,300 to $12,000 per year under the proposed plan.
“In general, the effects at Harvard, as well as other private institutions, will be more harmful to graduate students than at public universities, to the extent that Harvard and its peers charge higher tuition than other institutions,” Thomas wrote in an email.
According to Thomas, when including Massachusetts state taxes, Harvard’s Ph.D. students would owe almost half of their annual stipend in taxes.
Thomas noted, however, that it is still unclear whether all types of tuition support from universities would be affected.  The House bill specifically does not revoke the non-tax status of “qualified scholarships,” or tuition aid for any degree-seeking student.
In an email to graduate students last Thursday, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Interim Dean Emma Dench wrote the University is still studying the House proposal and “carefully watching” developments in Congress.
“We, too, are trying to understand the implications of this proposal, and we share your concern about the potential impact it could have on you as graduate students,” Dench wrote in the email.
Dench’s remarks follow statements made by graduate school administrators at other universities on the GOP bill.
Earlier last week, Yale’s GSAS Dean Lynn Cooley emailed students expressing her opposition to the tax plan, but did not confirm how Yale students would be impacted, according to the Yale Daily News. In contrast, according to the Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell’s Vice Provost and Graduate School Dean Barbara Knuth wrote that Cornell considers its tuition aid to graduate students as a qualified scholarship, and it would remain untaxed by the House plan.
“It’s very alarming for graduate students,” said Colleen Golja, a graduate student in engineering. “I can’t imagine paying more taxes than I already do.”
Austin Garner, a graduate student in biology, said the financial burden of taxing graduate students’ tuition grants could discourage them from less-lucrative careers outside the private sector, such as government or academia, after graduation.
“The proposal will have a significant impact on the United States’ ability to contribute to global science efforts,” Garner said.
In response to the House bill, graduate students from the Harvard Graduate Students Union- United Auto Workers and the GSAS Action Coalition organized phone banks last Friday to lobby legislators to oppose the House plan.
“Even if it’s not totally clear how it’s going to impact us at Harvard yet, it’s clearly a big deal for other schools,” said Joseph Cronin, a graduate student in anthropology who helped organize the phone bank.  “Other people are taking it seriously, so we are too.”
“It’s a little scary that even the University doesn’t know how this would impact us,” said Jack M. Nicoludis, a graduate student in chemistry and organizer with HGSU-UAW.
Participants made as many as 200 phone calls to legislators, according to a Facebook post from the unionization effort.
The Senate’s proposal, released last Thursday, does not repeal the tuition reduction exemption.  A vote on the House’s bill is anticipated in the coming weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, the Harvard cross country teams traveled to the University of Buffalo to compete against 39 women’s teams and 38 men’s teams at the 2017 NCAA Northeast Regional Championships.
Continuing his record-setting breakout season, freshman Hugo Milner placed 10th, the second-best finish by a Harvard freshman since Timothy Galebach in 2003. With temperatures dipping well below freezing, the team battled both the frigid cold and many of the nation’s top runners.
On the women’s side, Harvard was unable to repeat its second-place overall finish from 2016. Instead, the team landed in 12th place overall against a large and competitive field. Junior Kathryn Gillespie was Harvard’s top finisher, coming in 43rd place with a time of 22:43.5 on the 6k course. All finishing within a minute of Gillespie, Elianna Shwayder in 58th place, freshman Anna Juul in 69th, senior Fiona Davis, and sophomore Gillian Meeks rounded out the top five for the Harvard women.
In the men’s 10K, Hugo Milner led Harvard to 16th place overall. Individually coming in 10th place with a time of 32:26.1 on the Audubon Golf Course, Milner was the third-fastest freshman at the meet. Adding to his season accomplishments, Milner is the 11th runner in the history of Harvard men’s cross country to earn NCAA All-Regional honors.
“The race at Buffalo was extremely tough as temperatures got as low as 16 degrees Fahrenheit and included top competition,” Milner said. “Individually, to miss out on a place at the NCAA nationals by two places was frustrating, but I am pleased with the way the team and I gradually improved throughout the season to give our best efforts.”
Also scoring for the men’s team, senior Tyler Spear came in 43rd with a time of 33:10.0, senior Louis Colson finished in 67th, sophomore Will Battershill was 68th, and freshman Matthew Pereira crossed the finish line in 91st.
“The team ran really well, beating Yale and Dartmouth and narrowly missing Brown and Cornell,” Spear said. “This was the best race for the men’s team all season and a really solid sign of progress, especially since we closed the gap on Ivy League teams that beat us at Heps.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2014, Penn football finished the season 2-8, with a 2-5 mark in conference play, good for sixth place in the Ivy League. That year, Harvard coasted to an undefeated season and an Ancient Eight championship, outscoring its opponents by over 200 points over the course of the season.
Since then, the Crimson’s record has declined yearly, and so has its performance against the Quakers. In the most recent chapter, Harvard dropped a 23-6 contest against visiting Penn, which officially knocked the Crimson (5-4, 3-3 Ivy) out of title contention after Yale bested Princeton.
As the final score indicates, neither the Harvard offense nor the defense had a particularly good showing on Saturday afternoon. The Quakers (5-4, 3-3) tallied the most rushing yards of any Crimson opponent, and the Harvard offense scored single-digit points for the first time since 2009.
“At the end of the day, when you've got three trips to the red zone, you've got to come away with 21 points,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said.
FROZEN IN PLACE
Last Saturday, a long streak finally broke—Harvard scored fewer than 10 points for the first time since losing, 17-7, on Nov. 14, 2009.
Interestingly enough, that low-scoring loss also came against Penn. To add insult to injury, that 2009 game propelled the Quakers over the Crimson in the Ivy League standings, and Penn went on to win the league with one more win than Harvard.
In 2009, the Crimson had a chance to launch a comeback, and 2017 was no different. With 22 seconds remaining in the third quarter last Saturday, Quakers kicker Jack Soslow notched his second field goal of the day to make it a two-possession contest, 20-6.
However, Harvard made little progress on three full drives in the fourth quarter. The first looked promising, with a seven-yard end around to Justice Shelton-Mosley and a 14-yard completion to Adam Scott. On the next play, the drive collapsed when running back Charlie Booker fumbled and Penn’s Brody Graham recovered.
“So many opportunities, we got the ball away, and that’s something we’ve been lacking early in the season with getting those takeaways,” Quakers coach Ray Priore said. “That creates great energy and momentum, and our offense then capitalizes on it.”
The second and third pushes downfield looked equally promising, as quarterback Jake Smith and his halfback/tight end corps connected for big gains. Each drive eventually culminated with a series of incompletions. Neither possession would have made much of a difference, however, since Soslow had already extended Penn’s lead to 23-6 with his third field goal.
A TRE-MENDOUS OUTING
From the Quakers’ first snap of the game, it was clear the Crimson would have to contend with a force out of the backfield. Senior running back Tre Solomon took the handoff, blasted around the right edge, and coasted to the north end zone for a 77-yard touchdown.
By the end of the game, Solomon had amassed a season-high 181 yards on 15 carries, good for 12.1 yards per attempt. Sophomores Karekin Brooks and Abe Willows added 66 and 35 yards, respectively, which helped bump Penn’s total to 281 yards on the ground. This mark was the highest of the season against Harvard.
“I think it just all started up front with the offensive line,” Solomon said. “We were saying it all week—if we were going to have success, then they’re going to have to be the ones that make us successful.”
The Quakers’ rushing-heavy attack made up for uneven performances by quarterback Will Fischer-Colbrie and receiver Justin Watson.
The senior signal caller completed just over half of his passes, going 13-of-25 for 130 yards. He was intercepted twice, both times on the Crimson’s end of the field. His second pick proved more significant, as senior safety Tanner Lee jumped a route in the end zone to prevent a Penn touchdown as the first half expired.
Fischer-Colbrie’s sole touchdown of the game was reeled in by none other than Watson, who completed an over-the-shoulder snag in the end zone while draped in double coverage. Besides the impressive catch, Watson was relatively silent. The senior recorded his lowest receiving total of the season, gaining 48 yards on eight catches.
FUMBLED THEIR CHANCE
A four-play sequence in which each team lost a fumble made a rather lopsided contest interesting down the stretch.
After Smith was brought down on a sack and Zach Schmid punted the ball, Harvard received its big break. Solomon, who had imposed his will all afternoon, appeared to have broken away for another big gain, but Lee punched the ball out of his grasp. Senior Tim Haehl covered the loose ball, giving the Crimson new life with 12:24 left and a two-touchdown gap.
On first-and-10 at the Quakers 45, Booker took Smith’s handoff and immediately bounced into a group of Penn defenders. Harvard fans are accustomed to seeing Booker rebound from early contact, shrug off would-be tacklers, and drag others down with him. This time, however, the junior lost possession.
“I think the bottom line is that defensively we had some great takeaways, but we didn't match it by doing a good enough job on ball security offensively,” Murphy said.
The two turnovers happened in just 58 seconds of game action. On the ensuing Quakers drive, Soslow hit his third and final field goal to end the Crimson’s bid to stay afloat in the Ivy League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hard-working, resilient, and dedicated—members of the Harvard men’s soccer team (2-10-4, 1-4-2 Ivy League) displayed these qualities at times during a trying season. Yet despite the Crimson’s best effort, the team suffered results that it neither wanted nor necessarily deserved.
Last Saturday’s matchup with Penn epitomized the team’s travails. Tied 0-0 at halftime, Harvard watched as the Quakers scored an early goal and doubled that lead after a controversial referee decision. The sequence, combined with another late score, saddled the Crimson with a 3-0 defeat on senior day.
"It was not the season we hoped for, but we have a great group of guys on the team,” said co-captain and defender Justin Crichlow. “I'm optimistic for the future of the program.”
Perhaps many onlookers had expected Harvard to be similar to last year’s squad—and therefore believed an Ivy championship and a ticket to NCAAs were in the cards. True, the Crimson returned several playmakers and scorers from last year. Harvard had youth on its side, as underclassmen made up the majority of the roster. Several youngsters brought national, international, and professional experience.
Naturally, then, with a team this deep and riding off dominant performances in the past, the Crimson was expected to pick right back up from last year.
Yet Harvard found itself struggling throughout the season. The Crimson defense, led by Crichlow, fellow co-captain Eric Gylling, and goalie Kyle Parks, remained steadfast overall but had trouble defending set pieces. On the other end of the field, the offense went through growing pains of its own. For much of the season, opportunities on goal were few and far between, with players unable to find a rhythm and connect more than a few passes around opposing defenses.
After a slow start to the year, the team appeared to find its footing against Providence and Northeastern, but an unfortunate series of plays set the team back three more games. In each contest, the reason for loss was the same—untimely fouls and momentary breakdowns on set pieces that allowed the opponent to secure the decisive margin.
Though the season was nearly halfway over and the Crimson had only won once, there was still hope since Ivy League play had not yet started. When this phase of the season did begin, against Yale, Harvard stepped up and took down its rival, 2-1.
But just as the Crimson offense started to flow and the defense cleaned up its coverage of set pieces, opponents also stepped up. Each of the next six games went down as either a tie or one-goal loss, with the exception of one match.
Going into Saturday afternoon’s final game against Penn (4-12-1, 2-4-1), Harvard was not playing for a share of the Ivy title thanks to losses against Dartmouth and Columbia. Still, the team hoped to keep up a win streak against Penn, end the season on a high note, and give seniors a win in their last game donning a Crimson jersey.
As has been the case in the Crimson’s past few games, the two teams were evenly matched in the first half. The Harvard defense was tested from the onset, with the Quakers offense getting off a few shots and corner kicks in the first few minutes. The home team shut down Penn, though, with Parks making saves on the first two attempts at goal, including an acrobatic one to stop a breakaway, and the defense clearing the corner kick.
It wasn’t until the 16th minute that the Crimson responded with an offensive attack of its own, when sophomore midfielder Matthew Glass headed a ball towards goal that ended up high over the bar. This play ended up as Harvard’s sole attempt on goal in the first half, with the rest of the shots coming from the feet of Penn players.
Both teams had a comparably slow start to the second half, perhaps because the cold had set in during halftime, but within minutes Harvard was warmed up. Gylling took the first shot of the half. Like Glass’s effort, that attempt also went over the crossbar.
Penn’s response came seven minutes later. Freshman defender Alex Touche connected on a corner kick to send his side into the lead. The Quakers would never trail again.
Harvard was not deterred, however, and mounted an offensive effort that led to senior midfielder Christian Sady lining up for a penalty kick to equalize the game. Just as he was about to take the kick, the referee reversed the call, claiming that the ball had gone out of bounds before the foul was committed, and awarded Penn a goal kick.
The call elicited strong responses from both players and spectators, with objections stemming from the fact that final decision was made by a referee who was standing several yards away from the play and had a poorer vantage point compared to the referee who had originally awarded Harvard the penalty kick.
Penn took advantage of the confusion as well as the Crimson defense’s decision to play high and scored off of a breakaway.
Harvard, now down by two, came back strong once again. Sophomore forward Philip Hausen and senior forward Nate Devine both ripped off shots within a minute of each other, but the netminder blocked both. Soon after, Penn scored again, and despite a last-minute effort by freshman midfielder Paolo Belloni-Urso, the Crimson was unable to put a point up on the board.
“The game against Penn was obviously a disappointing end to our season,” Glass said. “It’s been a bumpy season, to say the least. With that said, we’re going to take this season and learn as much as we can from it. We have to learn from it and use that information to make something positive out of it in the offseason and coming into next season.”
Harvard may not take any hardware away from the 2017 season, but the team hopes to spur future growth at both the individual and team levels. Neither the senior day game nor the season played out the way that the Crimson wanted. But if Glass is right, then the trials of the 2017 Harvard soccer squad may serve as a quiet foundation for success in upcoming seasons.

Before you get all hyped for this year’s Harvard-Yale game, there’s something each of us has to consider: after a crazy night of partying in New Haven, where are you going to stumble to in an attempt to catch a few hours of sleep before you’re up and at ‘em at the tailgate? Don’t worry—with our numerous options, you will not have to resort to staying in a cardboard box on Yale’s campus.
Hit up that  person you once had a conversation with during Visitas.
You know that one person you met at Visitas that was super chill despite the fact that they were conflicted between Harvard and Yale? Yeah, it was a bummer when they picked the wrong school, but look on the bright side. This could be mutually beneficial for all the Harvard-Yale games to come in your time here.
Reach out to that one kid from high school you kinda sorta knew that went to Yale (and try to make amends after you scoffed at their decision).
High school was a rough time, but you were all in it together, after all. Appeal to their nostalgia, and before you know it, you’ve gotten yourself a place to stay!
Book a hotel room with your squad.
If sleeping on the floor of a Yale dorm doesn’t appeal to you, why not spend some money for a comfy hotel room (that we all know you’ll barely spend any time in)? Hack: if a hotel room is too pricey, enlist more people to join. It could get cramped, but like we said, who’s really sleeping?
Join a club and mooch off its arrangements.
At this point in the year, it may be a little late to join any clubs. However, we’re sure that there are some campus organizations that would be more than happy to turn a blind eye to the fast-approaching Harvard-Yale game and accept your clearly pure intentions of joining the organization.
Meet someone when Yale plays at Harvard.
Yes, no Yale team plays at Harvard before The Game next weekend, but it’s never too early to plan for 2020. While we are not advocating scheming to get involved with a Yalie, what’s the harm in befriending one and in doing so scoring yourself a floor (or if you’re lucky, an air mattress or couch) to crash on for the night? Be proactive!
Hope that your sister College comes through. 
If none of the above options work out, look into finding a place to stay through Harvard and Yale’s sister House/College system. For freshmen, there are spots open in the common rooms of Yale’s Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin Colleges. If you want to score a spot though, you should act fast—there is a limit of 20 students per Yard. Check out this link for the form to sign up.
If you manage to make one of the above options work, get ready for a weekend of fun...just make sure you remember how to get back to your chosen place of rest at the end of the night.

Harvard-Yale is rapidly approaching. Because New Havenites have no class, tickets won’t be free for Harvard students. But don’t let this annoying detail stress you out or prevent you from seeing the game—we’re here to fill you in on key ticketing info so you don’t have to miss out on the fun.
Every undergraduate can purchase one ticket for $25. Don’t forget to bring your valid HUID; you won’t be able to buy a ticket without it (boo). Tickets are to be purchased and sold on a first-come, first-served basis—we’re not sure if that means they could run out, but we wouldn’t take the risk.
To purchase on-campus:
You can stop by the Harvard Athletic Ticket Office, located in Murr Center, 65 North Harvard Street (aka in the athletics complex) Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. But if you’re too lazy to cross the river, you can also grab your ticket at House dining halls or the Berg throughout the week. See the schedule below:
Tuesday, November 14th
Lehman Hall/Dudley (1 p.m. to 3 p.m.)
Pforzheimer Dining Hall (5 p.m. to 7 p.m.)
Wednesday, November 15th 
Kirkland Dining Hall (Noon to 2 p.m.)
Adams Dining Hall (5 p.m. to 7 p.m.)
Thursday, November 16th 
Lowell Dining Hall (5 p.m. to 7 p.m.)
Annenberg (5 p.m. to 7 p.m.)
Try and have cash on hand because those pesky card readers have been giving the athletics staff some trouble. And a word to the wise: don’t wait until the last day to buy your tickets on-campus, especially not at the Berg. Imagine 1,700 frenzied freshmen scrambling to get a ticket at once…
To purchase off-campus:
If you messed up and hardcore procrastinated buying the tickets in-person at Harvard, or you want to purchase additional tickets, you can always get them online at this link via Harvard Athletics or directly at this link. Prices vary with premium tickets selling for $75, adult tickets for $55, and youth tickets for $45. You also will have the opportunity to purchase tickets in-person at the Yale Athletics Ticket Office, located at 20 Tower Pkwy, New Haven, but you will probably have to wait in line for hours. Plus, if you order online, you save $1-$2 per ticket.
Financial assistance:
If you require financial assistance to purchase your ticket, consult the Freshman Dean’s Office or the Financial Aid Office. There was a form circulating where you could request a free ticket, but the deadline was Tuesday, November 7th. Even if you missed that, it never hurts to directly contact the FDO or FAO.
So mark your calendars and make sure you get a ticket early—we need all Crimson hands on deck to show Yale who’s boss.

Let's set the scene. Harvard v. Yale, 55 years ago. Richard P. Bissell '36 decides to pen the instant classic You Can Always Tell a Harvard Man. The novel discusses what apparently distinguishes a Harvard man from a Yale man, among other things. You can check it out for yourself in Widener if you want a couple of choice insults to carry with you into New Haven. However, if you’re like most students and don’t have time to be perusing the stacks in your free time, here are just a few highlights:
“When a Yale man is sick, the authorities immediately assume he is drunk. When a Harvard man is drunk, the authorities assume that he is sick.”
Today, the authorities know they’re both drunk.
“‘Did you go to Harvard?’ is the first question your average royalty asks on meeting an American...This attitude is a source of irritation to Yale men and causes them to recite in loud voices many very naughty jokes at Harvard’s expense.”
The question, “Did you go to Harvard?” still upsets Yale grads as much as it excites Harvard grads. In previous generations, they could “recite in loud voices many very naughty jokes at Harvard’s expense,” but now they apparently repeat the same joke.
A Harvard grad and Yale grad met in the bathroom during halftime of The Game. The Harvard graduate said, "Didn't they teach you to wash your hands at Yale?" The Yale grad responded, "They taught us not to piss on our hands."
Hey, if it’s on Comedy Central, it’s legit, right?
“If you live in Bridgeport you can save a lot of carfare by going to Yale instead of Harvard.”
Saving money on transportation was the principal reason way back when why someone would go to Yale instead of Harvard. The jury’s still out on what the principal reason is in 2017.
“In fact non-Harvard people have even been known to take what might be interpreted as an unfriendly attitude toward America’s Greatest University.”
Once again, Yale falls short of Harvard. It’s only the second-most arrogant school in the country.
