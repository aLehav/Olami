After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is no doubt that important conversations are being had about the fate of next semester. Group chats, Zoom calls, and office hours are abuzz with speculations about what Harvard will look like in the fall.
Until now, I, like many students, have felt powerless in the wake of the administration’s decisions about our education and the future of our college experience. We were simply told when to leave, what grades will look like, and how to continue learning. Amid the chaos of the crisis, I was not only willing, but happy to accept this guidance and certainty. Now, however, as I have gained my bearings and as my next semester comes under attack, I can no longer passively accept the administration’s best judgment. It is time for Harvard to listen to its students.
During this time of reflection, I have come to three realizations: First, students should have been consulted about the fall from the beginning. Second, the college cannot go online for an official semester. And third, Harvard must make a decision sooner rather than later.
First off, I am baffled at the fact that we, the students, are not being broadly consulted about the future of our education. As the fate of next semester weighs heavily on our minds, it is imperative that we are given a voice. Harvard, after all, is an academic institution created to cultivate the minds of students. How, then, can it make a decision about the fate of students without their input?
When we were dismissed in March, there was a sense of urgency that excused the administration’s lack of student outreach. Things were bad — there was no time for surveys or panels. Now, after sitting at home for a month staring at a computer for hours a day, I am still waiting for an email that asks what I want out of next semester, let alone if I want a next semester at all.
I call on the administration to seek student opinions through focus groups, discussions, or perhaps, even a vote. They must do whatever it takes to incorporate the student voice into a decision that alters the lives, future careers, and finances of students. I applaud the professors that have taken time out of their courses to ask their students how they are doing and what they would like to see out of next semester. Though this is a step in the right direction, it is not enough. The administration must reach out to the students directly.
And if they don’t, I urge all my fellow Harvard students to redirect your opinions from student-only discussions towards the administration. I too find myself venting in group chats only to realize that the complaints and feasible suggestions are not being presented to the decision-makers. Email and attend office hours with the administration, your professors, and your House faculty deans with thoughtful suggestions. Write public pieces, suggest different scenarios — do whatever you can to present solutions that best benefit Harvard students, employees, faculty, and staff.
Second, I do not, under any circumstances, want to waste a semester at Harvard online. And frankly, it seems that nobody does. This is a viewpoint that has already been endorsed by students. Its implications, however, are so important that it must be repeated.
Given the articulated risks of going back to “normal” in the fall, to me, the most logical solution is for Harvard to suspend the fall semester and start anew in the spring, maybe adding a semester in the summer to make up the time. At the very least, the fall semester should be flexible — perhaps there could be an option to take a couple of classes online. But should this be a full-fledged semester? I certainly hope not.
Let’s face it — if we go online, a huge portion of the student population will seek time off. Can Harvard stop them? Can Harvard accommodate the influx of students when things go back to normal? By pushing off the semester, these difficult questions do not need to be answered. Moreover, students will not have to spend a semester of their Harvard experience online. Harvard will not face the backlash from students and their families that would certainly accompany the shift to an online education.
Going online is not the only terrible idea; going back to campus without a social life will not suffice either. In each of my classes, professors and students alike spend a moment each class lamenting the loss of the in-person authenticity that is undoubtedly a highlight of our education. What’s more, social events, athletics, extracurriculars, and more would be put to the side for another semester. These in-person activities, however, are crucial components of the college experience. I struggle to believe that Harvard students would passively accept yet another semester without these opportunities. A decision must be made that preserves both the education and social integrity of our Harvard experiences.
And finally, if or when this decision is made, it must be made sooner rather than later. As one of the first colleges in the country to vacate students and transfer courses online, our decision carried weight.
If we decide to move our semester or postpone our start to spring, it is almost certain that other academic institutions will follow our mark. This means that for this year, there could be a unified timeline off of which job recruiting, athletics, and graduations could potentially adjust.
I feel now, more than ever, I have to be clear about what I want and what I think is best for my peers: the administration must take student suggestions, they must not go online in the fall for a traditional semester, and they must choose quickly. This is my effort to shape my future at Harvard. I hope other students come forward as well. We have logical answers as we are the ones being affected. We must ensure that an institution built for us, listens to us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every night back on campus, usually after dark, when I find myself departing some study spot on the river to walk back to my house in the Quad, I invariably hear someone say: “Are you sure you want to walk back alone? You know, as a woman…”
I would never suggest that there aren’t real risks to women, but more relevantly to anyone, who chooses to walk across our campus at nighttime. I have heard stories of friends getting mugged or harassed, and have even experienced moments myself of feeling slightly frightened or concerned while making that nightly trek.
But, I do feel confident in saying that reducing or equating this concern to my womanhood is entirely unproductive. More times than I care to count I have been told about some experience that I must understand because I, myself, am a woman. Whether they are tales of catcalling or fearing for one’s safety after dark or feeling threatened by a male colleague, I have noticed that people can be quick to generalize the female experience. But, what does that mean then for those of us women who may not have experienced some of those events that are repeatedly treated as a rite of passage?
I can’t recount a specific instance of being catcalled, for example. It’s entirely possible it has happened, especially considering the volume at which I listen to my music when I stroll down city streets, but I can honestly say I have never felt objectified by a passerby. And, besides the occasional volunteers asking for signatures for a petition on the sidewalk, no one had ever propositioned me or approached inappropriately. Even when working over my gap year, I never had to brush off sexual comments or innuendos from male co-workers. Yet, when I talk to my girlfriends about their experiences, it’ll often seem like these kinds of encounters are assumed, just part and parcel of being a woman. Am I not a woman then?
On the other hand, media, and film often portray women as being pitted against one another. The celebrity world is often plagued with questions of which actress wore an outfit better. Tabloids are full of dramatic, overblown “catfights” between musicians. The popular narrative on womanhood either overgeneralizes by assuming universal experiences that are not always shared, or it does the extreme opposite by actively dividing women between the jealous and the coveted, the beautiful and the not so much, the haves and the have-nots. Either way, women are divided, demarcated, and disassociated, at a time when true unity is needed the most with emerging conversations in feminism and the Time’s Up movement.
Indeed, women will often try to generate such universal definitions of womanhood in order to engender solidarity, but in reality, it only further divides us. There is no singular, common experience. Surviving sexual assault does not make me any more a woman than one who, thankfully, has not had to. Choosing to dress up in frilly frocks and glide across the ice rink as a figure skater every morning before school for 14 years certainly does not make me any more a woman than my sisters who played on their schools’ field hockey teams or any less of one than my best friend who played no sports whatsoever. Having many guy friends, not being particularly “girly,” and preferring the color blue to pink are not demerits in some kind of tally on my female experience.
In the age of feminism, a conversation has emerged not only on what is required to be a proper advocate for gender equality but also on what it means to be a woman, period. One approach has been to universalize the female experience, but that inevitably leaves some women feeling alienated; another has been to actively divide women along arbitrary categorizations. However, the best approach would be to recognize and embrace the multidimensionality of womanhood. Instead of speaking for all women, let’s speak for ourselves and encourage other women to add nuance to the conversation by doing the same. Even though the term ‘womanhood’ implies a singularity to the experience, women everywhere today prove how multifaceted the female experience really can be — even in mundane instances like walking home, alone, in the dark, to the Quad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School affiliates are circulating a petition calling for the Law School Administrative Board to stop investigating three students involved in an October 26 silent protest organized by the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, a campus activist group.
The protest took place during the Law School’s 45th Annual Fall Reunion. Student organizers distributed flyers and silently held up signs calling on Harvard to divest its endowment from companies tied to the prison industry while Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 spoke at an alumni event.
The Administrative Board subsequently opened an investigation on student protestors Amanda T. Chan, Felipe D. Hernández, and Anna L. Nathanson for alleged violations of the Law School’s Protest and Dissent Guidelines, according to the petition.
“During that event, the Student Dissenters followed the Protest Guidelines by displaying signs peacefully, silently, expressing their free speech, and not interrupting the speaker in an open event,” the petition reads. “We are gravely concerned by the Board’s opaque and unfair process as well as the threat of severe punitive consequences, including delayed graduation, suspension, and expulsion.”
According to the Law School’s guidelines, students may stand or display signs noiselessly so long as they do not interfere with the audience’s view or ability to pay attention to the speaker. The guidelines also restrict signs and prolonged standing to the back of the room where the protest occurs.
The petition — which calls on the Administrative Board to drop the investigation — is addressed to Manning, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, and various law school professors and administrators, including the members of the Harvard Law School Administrative Board.
Specific recipients the letter names include acting Administrative Board chair and Law School professor Ruth L. Okediji, Law School professor Richard J. Lazarus, Law School professor Andy L. Kaufman ’51, Assistant Dean and Registrar Lisa Burns, Associate Dean N. Catherine Claypoole, Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells, and Associate Dean and Dean for Development and Alumni Relations Steven Oliveira.
As of Sunday morning, the petition has accumulated more than 1,050 signatures, according to Chan.
Law School spokesperson Jeff A. Neal declined to comment on individual students’ administrative board cases due to federal privacy law. University spokesperson Jason A. Newton also declined to comment.
The petition states the Administrative Board did not conduct its investigation promptly and has not yet allowed the students under investigation to examine the evidence against them.
“It has been 182 days since the protest,” the petition reads. “The Ad Board’s unreasonable delays have added tremendous uncertainty to the lives, graduation, bar passage, and career prospects of the student protestors.”
Chan, one of the three “student dissenters” named in the Administrative Board investigation, said the Administrative Board first notified her of the investigation on Feb. 5 — months after the Oct. 26 incident. She said she studied the protest and dissent guidelines at the Law School “very carefully” before engaging in the silent protest.
“To this day, not a single administrator, a single professor, a single disciplinarian has ever stated what action exactly that I have taken that may have violated the guidelines,” Chan said. “Yet here I am 182 days later, still under investigation, still unsure if I'm going to be able to graduate on time, still unsure if I'll even be charged in the matter.”
She also said that she wished Harvard expended more resources on helping students and workers instead of conducting the Administrative Board investigation.
“I wish that Harvard could expend its resources and time on a million different things that include helping the community, instead of finding different ways to suppress speech, especially the speech of people who care about racial justice,” she said.
The petition also took issue with the fact that the Administrative Board’s investigation into the protest focused on three students of color.
Hernández, a student protestor, said he has personally faced challenges during the coronavirus pandemic, which he said disproportionately impacts people of color. He said  he believes the continued investigation demonstrates a lack of compassion from the University while the petition denotes support from his peers.
“There's a community out there who cares about us and is ready to organize and mobilize in support of us, particularly when we're facing an institution like Harvard Law School that for months has not cared about my family or my community, at least given that appearance,” Hernández said.
Nathanson, the third student in the investigation, agreed that Harvard should not dedicate its resources to pursuing the investigation in light of the ongoing pandemic. She also said the Law School’s decision to investigate without “a lot of grounding” could endanger free speech on campus.
HPDC alumni organizer Amber A. James ’11 echoed similar concerns about free speech within the Law School’s mission to teach about constitutional rights.
“The idea that they're taking action against students who are exercising those rights in the least disruptive way possible is a pretty scary and dangerous prospect,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the ongoing coronavirus pandemic forces postponements, cancellations, and the possibility of online exams, higher education experts say colleges and universities should adopt flexible standardized testing policies for prospective students.
Harvard College’s Admissions and Financial Aid Office informed high school juniors that they would not be penalized for not submitting scores from Advanced Placement tests or SAT subject tests in late March. Harvard still requires ACT or SAT test scores from all applicants, but acknowledges that students may be unable to retake the exams given cancelled and postponed test dates.
The College Board announced on April 15 that it would cancel the June 6 SAT date due to the virus, marking the third cancelled test day this year. The June 13 ACT testing date is still scheduled as planned, though the April 4 date was cancelled.
Some schools in the Boston area, such as Boston University, Northeastern University, and Tufts University, have made ACT and SAT scores optional for current high school juniors. Cornell University is the only Ivy League school to have made the tests optional for applicants to the Class of 2025.
Jay R. Rosner, executive director of the Princeton Review Foundation, a non-profit college consulting service for low-income and minority students, said test date changes could negatively affect applicants who are already impacted most by the coronavirus.
“These kids are getting hit from all directions,” Rosner said. “I cannot understand why universities have not already said, ‘we want to put the minds and mental states and concerns of all juniors at rest. We are test-optional for your cycle.’”
“I think colleges and universities owe that to the junior class,” Rosner said.
If the coronavirus pandemic derails the next SAT date, slated for August 29, the College Board announced plans to provide online tests from home.
“In the unlikely event that schools do not reopen this fall, the College Board will provide a digital SAT for home use,” the College Board wrote on its website. “As with at-home AP exams, the College Board would ensure that at-home SAT testing is simple; secure and fair; accessible to all; and valid for use in college admissions.”
Rosner, however, said he fears online versions of the tests could perpetuate existing inequalities students face because of their varying home environments.
“Even if you discount all the inequities involved — bandwidth, computer access, computer capability, internet access — and assume that somehow every low-income kid can sit there with reasonable bandwidth and a computer that’s adequate to the task, there still will be significant glitches,” Rosner said. “So, it’s inconceivable to me that this can run well.”
Phil Trout, former president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, said he believes schools that consider becoming test-optional in the long run have empirical backing for doing so.
“College and university admission offices, as they've done their validity studies, have seen time-and-again that the test score is not the greatest predictor of success,” Trout said. “So, I think that gives credence to the growing number of institutions that are, in fact, going test-score optional in their holistic review and admissions.”
Dennis Y. Yim, director of academics at Kaplan Test Prep, said he hopes students continue to see value in standardized testing even if those tests are not mandatory.
“What we also remind juniors is that when colleges waive test requirements, they're not saying ‘we don't care about them.’ They're saying, you don't need them to apply,” Yim said. “For students who have an opportunity to really change their standing in the admissions process by differentiating themselves with a higher score in one of these exams, there still may be an opportunity left at the end of the year to be able to do that.”
Despite an increasing number of schools deciding to make testing optional for applicants to the Class of 2025, Trout said that — like many other factors dependent on the outcomes of the pandemic — the future of standardized testing remains unclear.
“It is yet another example of something in the coronavirus pandemic where the only legitimate answer is ‘we don't know,’” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School-affiliated physicians working at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center saw their bonuses and employer contributions for retirement plans reduced or eliminated as of the end of March, according to the Boston Globe.
All physicians at Beth Israel, a Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital in Boston, are part of the Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians group practice. HMFP and an affiliated group — the Associated Physicians of Harvard Medical Faculty Physicians at BIDMC, who work in other hospitals around Massachusetts — together employ more than 1,600 providers.
The two practices suspended employer contributions to retirement plans effective April 1, which affected the majority of the 1,600 physicians, the Globe reported.
They also withheld bonuses for the first quarter, which ended March 30, except for emergency room physicians, who received half of their accrued bonuses. Those bonuses amounted to tens of thousands of dollars for some physicians.
The groups’ President and CEO, Alexandra B. “Alexa” Kimball, wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that the compensation changes come as the field grapples with uncertainty amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
“Like hospitals, physician groups are battling on two fronts: facing severe financial issues and a public health crisis on the front lines,” Kimball, who is also a professor of dermatology at the Medical School, wrote. “Federal and state relief supporting our doctors and health care workers who are selflessly caring for patients is essential to our success in battling this pandemic.”
As the United States comes to terms with stay-at-home orders and a shortage of personal protective equipment, medical workers also have also dealt with longer hours and more demanding working conditions.
At the same time, hospitals and health care providers are facing financial difficulties from the deferral of nonessential medical care. In March, Massachusetts ordered hospitals to halt “nonessential” medical procedures — a major source of hospital revenue — until the public health crisis improves.
Most research labs at the Medical School, Harvard’s School of Dental Medicine, Harvard’s School of Public Health, and Boston Children’s Hospital closed last month due to the pandemic.
In response to the need for medical workers to treat coronavirus patients, the Medical School began to explore the option of allowing fourth-year students to graduate early. The Medical School has also asked students to volunteer at the Boston Hope medical center, but drew criticism for not offering to compensate student volunteers.
As part of the $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress in late March, $100 billion was allocated to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will distribute the money to hospitals and other health care providers facing severe financial losses as a result of the pandemic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Class of 2024 sent an open letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow Thursday urging Harvard to postpone its fall semester rather than holding classes entirely online if the coronavirus pandemic precludes in-person classes.
The letter argues an online semester would create disadvantages for first-generation and low-income students, contribute negatively to students’ mental health, and make adjusting to college-level coursework difficult for the incoming class.
“As first-year students, we have yet to establish meaningful in-person relationships with classmates, faculty, advisors, and other mentors who will facilitate the transition to Harvard,” the letter reads.
“We fear that beginning instruction online would exacerbate inequalities existing among members of our class and may have long-lasting effects. In contrast, Harvard’s on-campus resources help level the playing field, allowing all students to fully engage in the learning process,” it adds.
At the time of the open letter’s submission to President Bacow, 271 students identified as prospective members of the Class of 2024 — along with 84 who signed on as current College students — had added their names to the petition.
Kendall I. Shields, a prospective member of the Class of 2024 who organized the effort behind the open letter, said she and other prospective members of her class first became interested in reaching out to President Bacow after connecting through a Class of 2024 GroupMe.
“I think the initial interest in postponing the semester was really just because, obviously, none of us want to miss out on the freshman experience. But as you begin to delve deeper into the different issues, you realize that there are actually a lot of complications with having an online semester, particularly for freshmen,” Shields said.
Angela Dela Cruz, another potential incoming freshman who contributed to the letter, said the process of drafting the open letter presented challenges as the admitted students attempted to work together to set the correct tone and present compelling points.
“We did not want the letter to be too long, and we wanted to make our message as clear and concise as possible,” she said. “There was also the other problem of making sure that the wording was more positively connotated rather than negatively connotated.”
Laila A. Nasher, another admitted student, said she felt it was important to voice her opinion as a low-income student.
“There's obviously going to be things about Harvard's freshman experience that we'll all miss. But we're willing to sacrifice those luxuries,” Nasher said. “It’d be especially tough on low-income students, especially people who don't really come from stable home environments, live with a large family where everyone is talking, live in unsafe environments, and don't have stable internet connection or access to technology.”
“Even right now, doing online school is extremely tough for me, and I can only imagine what it would be like if I was doing Harvard online,” she added.
The open letter also encourages administrators to be especially mindful of University employees as they make decisions about the fall semester.
“We hope that, regardless of what academic schedule is ultimately chosen, the administration takes measures to continue prioritizing the financial security of its faculty and staff,” the open letter states.
Ryan D. Nguyen, another prospective student, said he valued the opportunity to voice his opinion in itself, regardless of the effort’s outcome.
“To the Harvard community at large, even if our letter doesn’t enact any change, we’re just grateful to be heard and grateful that Harvard is a place that you can voice your opinion without repercussions,” Nguyen said. “That's something that I've always looked forward to — being able to speak out and have a voice.”
The letter concludes by noting the students “trust that Harvard’s administration will act in our best interests,” and that they will support whatever final decision administrators make about the fall semester.
Shields, however, added she ultimately hopes that President Bacow heeds the open letter and fully considers the opinions of some of the College’s newest students.
“I do think that he should really value our perspective, because we are the future of Harvard, and we are part of the members of the community,” she said.

Cambridge City Council members Alanna M. Mallon, Marc C. McGovern, and Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler say shifting the Council’s priorities toward the coronavirus pandemic has been frustrating, but necessary.
The City of Cambridge declared the pandemic a public health emergency on March 12, shortly after Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 declared a statewide state of emergency on March 10.
Since then, the City Council’s agenda has largely focused on dealing with the immediate effects of the outbreak, including measures to support front-line workers and small businesses. Moreover, Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale have worked to open an emergency housing shelter, activate the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund, and implement testing in nursing homes.
Council committee meetings, however, have been cancelled and issues such as the Affordable Housing Overlay — which aims to streamline permitting processes for affordable housing developers — have been put on hold.
Sobrinho-Wheeler said this shift in priorities is disappointing but necessary in an interview Friday.
“We have priorities like housing, like transit, and they're gonna continue to be issues in Cambridge,” he said. “It's disappointing to have to put them aside for a minute, but this emergency and responding to the outbreak in cases has absolutely been the number one priority.”
McGovern also said other issues must “play second fiddle to this crisis” so city councilors can spend more time working on keeping residents safe and healthy. For McGovern, this has included engaging in “a lot more constituent work,” such as checking in with senior citizens, buying and delivering food, and referring residents to city support services.
McGovern said canceled meetings, along with measures to support businesses and tenants, will have come “first and foremost” when the city regains a sense of normalcy.
Sobrinho-Wheeler, who has filed a proposal to use video conferencing for City Council committee meetings, said the additional meetings are an important part of discussing issues exacerbated by the pandemic.
“We should think about having them again to talk about housing, to talk about transit, to talk about municipal broadband issues that aren't separate from the pandemic — they're really related when we talk about the city's response,” he added.
The Cambridge Public Health Department has reported 706 residents have tested positive for coronavirus since the outbreak began, and has confirmed 42 related deaths.
In an interview Sunday, Mallon, the city’s vice mayor, said she thinks it is “really hard” to consider reopening the city because of a lack of available testing kits.
“I would like for us, as a city, to be able to test all of our front-line employees to make sure that they are not asymptomatically carrying the virus,” Mallon said. “And we simply do not have that testing capability right now.”
“I don't think that there's a universe where we ever are going to flip the light switch and everything goes back to the way it was,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the coronavirus threatens to disrupt juniors’ preliminary thesis research this summer, departments are working to develop contingency plans and modify expectations for their concentrators’ capstone College projects.
Almost half of Harvard students undertake theses — independent, original research projects — over the course of their senior year. The College also uses performance on senior theses as a metric of mastery when assigning Latin honors.
Dominic M. Mao, assistant director for Undergraduate Studies for Chemical and Physical Biology and Molecular and Cellular Biology, wrote in an email that MCB and CPB theses require scientific research that is either wet lab-based, computational, or a combination of the two. Because much of this research typically occurs over the summer, University-wide cancellations have foiled students’ plans.
“Many of our students are facing the challenge of adjusting their planned projects because they will have much less time than they originally planned to collect their own experimental data,” he wrote.
The concentrations will also encourage students to communicate with their labs about online data sources that could be “productively mined,” including literature, public databases, and published datasets. CPB and MCB will host a town hall online with prospective thesis writers to discuss general contingency plans, followed by one-on-one meetings to discuss individual situations.
Thesis-related logistical difficulties will likely extend beyond the sciences, though. Humanities and social science concentrators also said the coronavirus pandemic has forced them to shift their plans.
Most undergraduates in the Art, Film, and Visual Studies department, for example, undertake creative theses that involve either filmmaking or studio art, according to director of undergraduate studies Matt Saunders ’97.
While on campus, concentrators use studio spaces, equipment, materials, and editing suites with all costs covered by the AFVS department. They can also solicit help from fellow students, who serve as cast and crew members.
Saunders said he believes the department will be able to accommodate most students on the studio art track by shipping necessary materials. This semester, Saunders said he successfully ordered and shipped roughly 70 basic painting kits to the students in his course. The AFVS department also sent cameras home with students who have slowly begun shipping them back to campus via FedEx.
The roughly half a dozen students producing film theses face additional obstacles since they now lack access to student crew members and actors on campus.
“We had some people who were still shooting this semester when the governor’s orders came in, and we had to reach out to them and reassert the idea that there couldn't be more than three people in the room at a time, and it definitely changed some projects,” Saunders said.
As the AFVS department reviews proposals, Saunders said the department will note if students proposed ambitious theses such as feature films with large casts or large welded steel sculptures and advise them on how to modify their projects.
Even for students who are conducting their research alone, global travel restrictions have hampered their ability to plan research projects.
George Soroka, the assistant director of undergraduate studies in the Government department, said many concentrators spend the summer before their senior year traveling to administer experiments, run surveys, and conduct interviews across the globe. But a University-wide moratorium on Harvard-sponsored travel has thwarted those plans.
“I wish we had some well laid out way forward for our students. But to be perfectly blunt, we're adapting to circumstances just like they are,” he said. “Having said that, the department is trying to make every effort to be proactive.”
Soroka said his department is working to free up funds so they will be available to students if travel becomes possible in the fall, or even over winter break. He added that the department would consider making the thesis deadline more flexible for students who are obliged to conduct research later than anticipated.
“One thing we always tell students is that the research you conduct for your thesis never ends up looking the way you think it will when you approach it. And that's a good thing because that means that research is a living, breathing thing,” he said.
Anya B. Bassett, director of undergraduate studies in the Social Studies department, wrote in an email that the University’s travel ban has precluded concentrators from doing some “in-person” thesis research, for which they typically “spread out across the world.”
She noted that the department is collaborating “one-on-one” with students whose plans have been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus crisis.
“We’ve been encouraging them to identify their core questions and helping them to re-think how they might be able to answer those questions in different ways,” she wrote.
One student who initially planned to conduct in-person interviews is now administering an online survey, Bassett wrote. Another who planned to conduct research in an international archive has shifted their focus to a local archive that has been partly digitized. Harvard research librarian Susan M. “Sue” Gilroy recently curated a digital “primary source field guide” for social studies concentrators as they embark on their thesis research.
Justin Tseng ’21, a joint concentrator in History and the Classics, said the coronavirus has disrupted his plans to visit archaeological sites for thesis research. Tseng added that though many requisite library resources are available digitally, the databases are “clunky to navigate.”
“I guess it's not thought of as much as thesis writers who are going to do it on science,” he said. “But without a lot of these print resources, it's really difficult to do research.”
McKynzie R. Romer ’21, a concentrator in Romance Studies, also said she expects conducting thesis research will be difficult without access to Harvard’s libraries.
“I'll have to find everything online, or order books myself,” she said. “Time constraints are different because I won't be able to find things as easily if they end up being less popular.”
Romer added that she was grateful for the small size of her concentration cohort, which ensured that she could talk to her advisor about adjusting her plans within just two weeks of vacating campus.
As departments guide students through these unprecedented challenges in completing their theses, Soroka said an ethos of “transparency” is essential.
“I know it's not always satisfying to have someone say, ‘We don't know,’” he said. “But we've at least committed to, ‘If we say we don't know, we say we'll try to find out as soon as we can.’”

Results:
Mostly As: The Zoomer
The best and worst part about Zoom is that you can hide behind the screen, so you’ve been thriving during this time. Instead of spending an hour to get ready, you can wake up at 8:58 a.m. to join a 9 a.m. call, without ever changing out of your sweatpants. Also, you’ve spent so long staring at that cutie whose thumbnail video you’ve pinned that, even though you two have never exchanged Zoom chats, you’re really feeling a connection with them.
Mostly Bs: The TikTok Star
Your biggest achievement is having your TikTok reposted on Harvard College’s Instagram page. At this point, the only words you know are ‘Savage,’ ‘Renegade,’ and ‘The Box.’ Your dance videos have been scouted by every dance club on campus, and the improv and stand-up clubs are already trying to recruit you after watching your skits.
Mostly Cs: The Obsessive Facebook and Groupme Texter
As the creator of that Google Sheet where everybody puts in their personal information — their Instagram username, their hometown, and their SAT score — you already feel deeply connected to the Harvard community. By the time you get to campus, you’ll basically be a household name.
Mostly Ds: The Tinder Master
You haven’t gotten out of bed for days, but Tinder has been your savior. There’s no need to get ready when the only work you need to do is scroll through your camera roll and find your best personality pictures. Now that you’ll finally have access to Tinder U, the possibilities are endless.
