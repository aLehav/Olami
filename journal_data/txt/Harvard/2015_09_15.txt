After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When I was in Crimson Key, I used to tell people that there is a closed book in the original Harvard coat of arms to encourage you to explore outside of the classroom,” Michael S. Roiff ’01 said to a packed crowd at the American Repertory Theater’s Loeb Drama Center on Sept. 11. Despite concentrating in economics, Roiff was heavily involved in theater at Harvard—an extracurricular activity that eventually inspired him to become a film producer. As the musical adaptation of his 2007 movie “Waitress” began its run at the A.R.T., Roiff returned to Cambridge to share his experience.
At the talk, Roiff described his beginnings in film: After moving to Los Angeles, he founded Night & Day Pictures and started looking for scripts with potential. When he read Adrienne Shelly’s screenplay for “Waitress,” he immediately realized it could be the opportunity he was looking for. Despite lacking both resources and prior experience in filmmaking, Roiff went to great lengths with Shelly to turn the story into a film; in one instance, he waited six months for lead actress Keri Russell to finish another film. “For these six months I just talked to Adrienne about nothing for a long time every day, because we both had nothing else to do,” Roiff said. However, it was a time that would ultimately prove crucial to “Waitress”—as Roiff and Shelly chatted about the details of the project in the intervening period, they came up with numerous new possibilities for their film.
Until “Waitress” was accepted to show at Sundance, Roiff said that he and his collaborators felt unsure about the future of the film. Immediately after its debut, though, “Waitress” received great reviews at the festival and offers from the likes of MGM Studios and Fox Searchlight Pictures. “At that time we didn’t have an office, and we had to go to an ice cream shop to make the call…. We were kicked out because it was midnight and the shop was closing,” Roiff recalled.
The distribution rights of “Waitress” were eventually sold to Fox Searchlight, and based on this success, Roiff went on to produce Neil Abramson’s “American Son,” Cheryl Hines’s “Serious Moonlight,” and many other independent films. Now well known for his independent movies, Roiff has branched out to adapt “Waitress” into a musical alongside director Diane Paulus. The show premiered at the A.R.T. on Aug. 2 and is scheduled to run through Sept. 27, after which it will move to Broadway.
Given his success in the industry, when asked in an interview what he would tell aspiring filmmakers, Roiff had some words of advice to offer. “When you first come to Hollywood, you feel everyone has the same last name and everyone is connected,” Roiff says. “It is like a party where everyone knows each other and you are left alone…but every day there are new people who join this party.” Roiff attests that while the film industry is very competitive, it is also very open; talented and hardworking people will always have a shot, he says.
It was not only budding producers who found value in Roiff’s talk. Claire Frederiksen, a first-year student at the A.R.T. Institute, felt that Roiff’s talk was informative for undergraduate students who may be artistically inclined but not necessarily familiar with the entertainment industry, since Roiff is more an entrepreneur than an artist himself. “I’m not so much interested in going the producing side, but I think it’s very interesting to hear from somebody who’s involved. It’s very helpful for any career,” she says.

Spanish-Argentine writer Andrés Neuman’s latest collection of short fiction, “The Things We Don’t Do,” can indeed be said to concern itself with “not doing.” The conditional tense—“would’ve could’ve should’ve”—is the main aesthetic program undergirding the stories. Plots are given their pattern not by achievement or definition so much as frustration and self-contradiction. A shy adolescent believes he is about to get “lucky” with his fantasy girl at a beach, but his amorous dream soon becomes a watery terror; a man recalls how his dying grandfather, unaware of the surprise that awaits him at the last, sank to an intended death in his bathtub; a widower tries to forgive his enemies, only to feel unnerved by the actual difficulty of making amends. Each piece seeks to enlighten by disorientation. Sometimes this repeated administration of electro-shocks works well: stories snap and purr felicitously around staged disruptions of familiar experience in a way that recalls the rousing tactics of Brechtian theater. But in general, Neuman’s promising enthusiasm is too roundly spent upon his insistence on whimsy in his tales. They aim so often at provocation alone, that a sense of balance or fullness chronically eludes the work.
The strength of the best pieces lies in Neuman’s adeptness at psychological documentation of the ways people change their minds or how they get lost in good intentions and never make it to their destinations—whether in a conversation that missed its goal of reconciliation, in a physical journey, or in life. In “a line in the sand,” a married couple on vacation find themselves physically at odds with each other when the discontented wife, seized by a fit of anger, draws a line in the sand and dares her outraged husband not to cross it. The husband is hurt that she is “playing silly games” with him, and goes along with it “halting,” fumbling, trying to get through to her. But is he such a saint? “There isn’t one line,” the wife says at last. “There are two, do you understand? There are always two. I see yours. Or at least I try to see it. I know it’s there, somewhere.” It is hard to conceive of an image that more humorously or helplessly conveys the concept of personal boundaries, nor one that could be more brilliantly turned on its head by Neuman’s whip-fast revelation of who has really shut out whom. Yet even this, one of the more relatable episodes, has some less credible moments. Take the exchange between the spouses, at their argument’s climax: “‘All I’d love is for you to look a little bit beyond your own territory.’ ‘All I’d love is for you to love me,’ he replied.” Such dialogue is weary, cardboard, and unjustified.
As illustrated by this case, Neuman’s stories don’t quite stand up to comparison with Borges, who he has been paired with by some critics. There is less arabesque in the former’s style, less erudition, less a Shakespearean sense of ripeness. Granted, here as in other places Neuman is still entertaining on his own terms; his writing is erratic yet vigorous. There is an unsettling coldness to his prose, a sharpness of cut that proves refreshing in some moments but is, in many others, unfulfilling. In particular, his descriptions of objects and physical features are consistently hit or miss. At the beginning of “secondhand,” for instance, Neuman introduces a woman who is about have her period: “her period was going to start: an insistent dagger below her navel and a feeling of irritation at everything were signs.” Doubtful metaphors like the “insistent dagger,” or elsewhere, descriptions like “the rushing sound of his own blood, the pounding of his veins, the electric buzz of the lamps trained on him” prove just a little too blunt to be convincing.
It is an additional and concomitant disappointment that often the point behind a story—neither wholly didactic nor purely formal—seems too much to order its progression, and the turns feel exaggerated. The so-called twist behind “how to swim with her,” a narrative about a boy who wants to awe his male friends by swimming out to sea with an attractive girl, is unimpressive even as it startles, for example. The greater logic that holds together most of the improbable visions seems to be a feeling of karmic retribution which has likely been earned by Neuman’s unfortunates for not having said or done “the things,” those invisible but ineluctably important deeds, of the book’s title. If this logic were allowed more space to wander in the stories, they might linger in the mind, but as it is, Neuman fails to crystallize an environment specific enough to harbor deeply evocative ambiguities and real tragedy.
Perhaps a fairer standard by which to judge this work is that of stand-up comedy. Neuman tells a good joke. He waits for laughter. He tells another: not so good. Eh. Toss that, try again. And again. Such authorial relentlessness is surely stirring, just as the ingenious energy of an accomplished comedian’s sheer personality may always command genuine applause, independently of the success of any one wise-crack. Neuman’s dynamism in these attempts does seem to have its own inspirational virtue, and it illustrates bravely—if self-consciously—the heroism that Samuel Beckett famously conferred upon writers when he coined the stoic mantra “Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the thunderous applause, high-strung Q&A session, and gravitas of any such meeting of two immensely successful people, the conversation between Stephen King and Lee Child was a relaxed, low-volume meeting between friends. The two came together at Sanders Theatre on Wednesday night to discuss Child’s “Make Me,” the 20th book in his lucrative Jack Reacher action thriller series. The event was sponsored by the Harvard Book Store. King, the iconic suspense novelist, stopped through Cambridge on his way to Washington, D.C., where he received the National Medal of Arts on Thursday, and New York, where he appeared on Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” on Friday. A self-professed Reacher groupie who even included a laudatory reference to the character in his 2010 novel “Under the Dome,” King asked most of the questions while still leaving space for his trademark wit and a few surreal stories. By leaving space for Child, King helped the British author to reveal both his varied biography and his secrets to keeping fresh the continuing travails of Reacher’s messy world.
King didn’t take long before establishing the light mood of the evening. “Just a couple of white guys, sitting around talking,” he said, chuckling. King’s self-effacement underlies the surreal reality that both he and Child have become the elder statesmen of their respective genres. Ten of the 20 Reacher books, which concern a renegade ex-Army Policeman, have reached #1 on the New York Times bestsellers list. To summarize King’s accolades and accomplishments in horror, suspense, and fantasy writing in a short article would be a Herculean task. Instead of getting bogged down in their own significance, the two quickly turned to humor, offering jokes about Tom Cruise—who plays the supposedly 6 foot 5 inch Reacher in the film adaptation—and their own youths.
In a particularly salient bit, Child offered a surprisingly personal response to King’s questioning of how the British author knew so much of America. “I met this American girl at college in Britain,” Child said casually. “It was 1974. So we went to a party together on a Friday night,” he said. Momentarily, Child appeared to veer into crude territory. “I thought, ‘Well, I’ll try this one and the other one next. This could be a couple of weeks of good fun. That couple of weeks just last month turned into 40 years,” Child said. The author finally made the move across the pond with his wife Jane in 1998, a year after the first Reacher novel appeared.
King also asked Child how he amassed such broad-based knowledge of the military. Child revealed that he has been developing a team of FBI and Army consultants who help him check the realism of his plots. “There was a book called ‘A Wanted Man’ where I invented a kind of motel…it was for quarantining inconvenient witnesses, like an involuntary witness protection,” Child said. “So I wrote my friend.”
While King mostly took a backseat to Child’s clever storytelling, he stepped in when the audience began booing Tom Cruise’s casting as Jack Reacher. King offered a maxim from the 1999 film “The Green Mile,” based on his 1996 serial novel of the same name. “They cast a relatively unknown actor named Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. In the book John Coffey is supposed to be an African-American preacher who is a very, very big man,” King said. “Michael Clarke Duncan, God rest his soul—he was the gentlest, sweetest man you could ever want to meet—he was amazingly buffed up…but he was short. And you don’t know that he’s short in the film because he’s shot from up angles and because he’s standing on an apple box, or Tom Hanks sometimes was actually standing in a hole.” Both King and Child offered defenses of Cruise’s casting in the role, arguing that he had the charisma to make up for his lack of physical stature. “I think there’s been a conflation when it comes to Tom Cruise between his acting and some of his personal beliefs…he is a tremendously able physical actor,” King said.
While most topics of conversation stayed squarely within the realm of accessible pop culture or Late Night fodder, King offered a technical topic near the end of the discourse: “I have a more writerly question. In the early books, they’re all third person, and then there are a number of books where Reacher narrates, and now we’re back in the third person. Was that a conscious decision?” King asked, before adding, “probably nobody gives a shit about this but me!” “A writer can be stereotyped much as an actor can—I thought I’d do the second book as different as possible as the first while keeping the same character,” Child replied. It didn’t take Child saying this to recognize the staggeringly prolific careers of the two “white guys” on the stage, but the seriousness and vulnerability with which he acknowledged his desire to stay fresh was a powerful reminder.

Ariana L. Chaivaranon ’18 is a painter and VES concentrator in Adams House whose works of art have included cover art for the books "Hello Able Five" and “Metropolis” and paintings in “Renegade,” a Harvard magazine focusing on art and advocacy. After graduating from college, she plans to begin a career in the art world after graduation. She sat down with The Crimson this last week to talk about her past creations and her thoughts about the subject in general.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get into art?
Ariana L. Chaivaranon: Ever since I can remember, I’ve wanted to be an artist…. But it was really when I got a little bit older, between the ages of 10 and 15, [when] my grandmother wanted to take me to all the art galleries in the D.C. area…. I can still remember the way specific [pieces] looked and the emotions they gave me. That was when I realized, “Wow, art can make people feel intense things.” As a 12-year-old, what I was making wasn’t necessarily doing that, but I realized that it was a possibility.
THC: What’s the story behind your cover art for “Hello Able Five”?
ALC: During high school, [the author of “Hello Able Five”] Kerstin Trimble was publishing a biography]...[and] asked me to do [the cover art]. I actually went through two different versions. In one of them, you could see the faces of the main character and his wife. I re-did another version where you couldn’t see the faces because the families of the two were still alive, so showing faces that didn’t perfectly match…was a little controversial.
THC: Are there differences for you between producing art based on your own inspiration and based on someone else’s vision?
ALC: I did some commissions the summer of senior year in high school. It was nice to be able to help someone with their vision...but I was definitely not as invested in the process. I was putting off doing the artwork and felt like it was kind of a chore sometimes...whereas usually art is something that I can go to.... I know there are all kinds of controversies about this in the art world. I was in Prague this summer, and my final paper looked at the differences between graffiti art that’s done on the streets, commissioned works of street art, and then works of high art in museum[s] and how the graffiti style has kind of been appropriated by organizations and corporations… [This] beautifies the city...but on the other hand if the artist is being paid...it might not arise entirely organically.
THC: Do you prefer self-driven work to art done on demand?
ALC: There are artists all over the world who do both, and I don’t think doing one or the other legitimizes or delegitimizes the other…. [Y]ou have to make a living for yourself somehow, and whether you choose to do that through selling your art or through another outlet shouldn’t make you more or less respectable. I think part of art definitely does come from the artist...so as long as that isn’t lost in the commercial process. I think it’s still legitimate art.
THC: What is a piece of [your] art that brings you pride?
ALC: There’s a series that I made senior year of portraits of people around me.… [T]hey use similar palettes; they’re all on unstretched canvas...rather than being stretched over stretchers or a board...to convey a sense of immediacy to the viewer…. [It’s] ultimately getting at how I think people pay less and less attention to the things around them. As you become more absorbed in your phone and whatever you’re doing on there, you’re missing more of the things that go on around you. So by creating a work of art with speed…[I was] trying to evoke a bit of that sense of the here and now.
THC: What impact do you want to have on viewers of your art?
ALC: I think it’s easy to say you want to bring out the best in people, but I think sometimes the way to do that is not necessarily a positive feeling. I find a lot of times my work tends toward a darker, more neutral palette that doesn’t necessarily make people feel happy…. I think one of the things conducive to change is a state of discomfort. When people are comfortable, they tend to want to stay the way they are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About this time a year ago, Elizabeth Pattyn, then a sophomore at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, was standing, a bit nervously by her own account, in the Agassiz Theater’s Horner Room. She was at the first production meeting of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ upcoming production of “The Gondoliers.” During her freshman year at MassArt, she attended the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ production of “Patience” and left impressed with the polish of the production. She sent an email to one of the producers, asking if there was any way she could help with their next show. Now she was at Agassiz, about to start her first gig as a set painter. When it was her turn to introduce herself, Pattyn stood up, gave her name and year, mentioned she didn’t go to Harvard. Suddenly, everyone started applauding. “I didn’t know anyone on the production staff and had no prior technical theater experience,” Pattyn wrote in an email. “But [the applause] made me feel incredibly welcomed and valued as a member of the team.”
Pattyn is now a junior, and she has only become more involved in Harvard’s theater scene, working on three different shows this semester alone. Her experience isn’t singular: There are quite a few non-Harvard affiliated individuals who participate in Harvard’s theater scene in roles ranging from actors to musicians to set designers to choreographers.
Harvard’s theater community is, for the most part, overseen by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, which acts as the umbrella organization for Harvard theater. The group is responsible for holding Common Casting, the weeklong event through which the vast majority of Harvard productions are cast. Common Casting, though itself a fairly complex procedure, allows prospective actors to audition for as many or as few shows as they would like to make sure that directors’ final cast lists don’t have any troublesome conflicts, such as two productions independently casting the same actress as lead. Common Casting is something of a logistical feat, to be sure, but it is also in some ways the lifeblood of the HRDC, because it provides the organization with its membership. The criteria for HRDC membership are simple: Any Harvard-affiliated person who works on a Common Casted show is a member of the HRDC, with membership suspended only in the case of prolonged inactivity. Because Common Casting is seen as vital to a smooth casting process and is therefore widely used, the HRDC actually encompasses a pretty wide swath of Harvard’s theater community.
Common Casting is not only for Harvard students, however—students from other schools, as well as other individuals from the larger Boston area, consistently audition for parts during Common Casting week. “In my institutional memory, it’s always been a policy of HRDC to open up auditions to anyone in the community, whether that be someone from Emerson or Tufts or a doctor in Somerville,” HRDC President Magdalene M. Zier ’16 says. The HRDC’s official policy, according to their constitution, is that auditions are open to the public, but all else equal, “preference will be given to Harvard undergraduates.”
Still, it is difficult to ascertain exactly how much, if at all, this HRDC policy ends up affecting final casting decisions. The HRDC clause only comes into effect if the two performers are extremely similar in acting skill, which is a corner case that does not occur terribly often. “No two performers are ever really exactly equal. It’s rarely a thing where we have exactly the same amount of desire to cast these two people, but one of them goes here and the other goes there,” HRDC Vice President Daniel J. Prosky ’16 says. “It’s usually a much clearer distinction.”
However, the very existence of this policy could easily act as a slight deterrent to casting people from outside Harvard. “Even though we frequently have a lot [of outside actors] audition, there aren’t always as many cast as audition, because of that system we have in place,” says Emily E. Bergquist ’18, a theater-maker who has been involved in multiple shows on campus.
Perhaps due in part to this policy, shows differ wildly in the proportion of non-Harvard students they employ. Some shows have relatively large non-Harvard contingents involved—according to Zier, “Assassins,” an Oberon show she produced last year, had an orchestra that was almost halfway composed of non-Harvard students. But many other shows have very little, if any, non-Harvard presence. “This year there were a few [individuals unaffiliated with Harvard], here or there. I probably saw like three or five or something like that,” Prosky says. “I would say that it’s never really a sizeable portion of people participating in Common Casting.”
Some of this discrepancy might be because only actors go through the Common Casting system; directors usually find technicians, set designers, and other members of the crew. But even taking this into account, production staff members are often predominantly composed of Harvard students. “I’ve often been the only non-Harvard affiliate in the shows I’ve worked on,” Pattyn writes.
This underrepresentation could stem from a lack of outreach. “I don’t see us spending resources putting up posters in Porter Square,” Zier says. It’s difficult to fault the HRDC for not doing more, however, given that actively recruiting actors from outside Harvard might be outside the organization’s mission and scope as Harvard’s general-purpose, umbrella theater organization.
“We’re not really looking to reach out to find other opportunities and share them. They’re fantastic opportunities and if people want to submit them we’re happy to publicize them,” Prosky says. “But it’s not part of our stated goals.” If a production, HRDC or otherwise, wants to access a wider base of theater-makers, that production has to do its own publicity.
Much of the responsibility of casting a wider net lies with individual directors and producers. “We just publicized our auditions online, we had a Facebook event, we generated a lot of word of mouth, and personal emails to people,” Bergquist says, regarding “OSCAR at The Crown and the love that dare not speak its name,” a production for which she served as associate producer. “A majority of that cast was non-Harvard students.” The effort individual directors put into non-Harvard outreach seems to pay off. Individuals unaffiliated with Harvard can add a new sense of perspective to a production, especially since Harvard’s theater community is fairly close knit. “We frequently work with the same people over and over again—we do that for a reason, we do that because we like them—but also, just having a fresh set of eyes and new voice in the mix is always helpful,” Bergquist says. “Everyone that I have ended up working with I’ve had just a wonderful time with, whether it be in the cast or even on the staff. They just bring like a really good new energy.”
Apart from the particular camaraderie that a diverse team affords a production, can often provide a wide range of expertise to a production. “It’s really awesome to engage with students who study art full time and it’s just amazing to have their skill set with us,” says Kathleen C. Zhou ’18, a board member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players. Having a cast and crew with a wide variety of theatrical skills and backgrounds can greatly expand the horizons of a production, and allow it to tap into a deep pool of traditions and ideas.
Despite the benefits of working with non-Harvard students, the exchange is not particularly two-sided. “The Harvard theater community and the shows and organizations that we have here are all of a pretty high caliber and produce a lot of really good productions every semester,” Prosky says. “You really don’t see a lot of—or I haven’t seen a lot of—people branching and going to Emerson or BU or BC and participating in their auditions or their shows or anything like that.”
Harvard does enjoy a comparatively large amount of institutional support for its productions, a factor that draws outsiders to Harvard, rather than the opposite. “There is a small theater group among the consortium of colleges to which MassArt belongs,” Pattyn writes. “But it simply doesn’t have the resources that Harvard is able to provide in terms of production materials, performance space, budgeting, etc.”
When Harvard students seek theater shows outside of Harvard, they tend to gravitate more heavily towards professional productions, especially students who intend to pursue theater as a career. “What’s really exciting about a lot of members of the Harvard community who do theater here is that they do intend to pursue that in a professional capacity at some point,” Prosky says. “So when you have actors who are really committed to being actors, they, in addition to going through Common Casting and trying to do shows here, also look around and go out and audition for professional productions. And they’ve been cast.”
Given the number of Harvard students who aspire to a career in theater, it might seem strange that there is not a well-known, formal system expressly designed to help Harvard thespians find opportunities to participate in professional shows, especially given the abundance of networking events and on-campus interview opportunities in the fields of technology, consulting, and entrepreneurship. Though Harvard’s Office of Career Services does offer guidance for individual seniors trying to find spots in professional shows and otherwise advance their theater careers, and the American Repertory Theater is a close-by community resource, there isn’t a popular equivalent to the business on-campus interview program for theater.
If Harvard students want to make forays into professional theater, they often have to venture in independently, without the help of major recruiting and advising events like those offered by the OCS’s On-Campus Interview program. “If you want to do it, you kind of go out and you do it,” Prosky says. “There’s absolutely no framework. It’s really just a person-to-person thing, if it happens.” There are informal mechanisms in place to help inform others about professional theater opportunities—friends will often pass along roles and opportunities that may be outside their own areas of expertise. In addition, the HRDC’s newsletter does contain a section which lists potential gigs, but that section relies entirely on submissions—the HRDC itself does not seek out productions beyond Harvard’s campus. Beyond Harvard’s own efforts, there are Boston-wide Facebook groups where directors and producers will post information about shows. But the predominant method for finding productions is still one-to-one interpersonal outreach. “Similarly to how we do it with other schools, people will send individual emails or text messages,” Bergquist says. “In the same way that we see success reaching out to individual people, they see the same success reaching out to us.”
Of course, an acting career cannot be wantonly compared to a career in a tech firm, and networking tools that work well in other fields would not necessarily beperfect fits for Harvard’s theater community. “I think part of it is also the difference in the structure of the theater industry versus these STEM things, where you can work for a company and get retained,” Zhou says. “Most of the time, [in theater] you’re just trying to get gigs.” Since most productions, except at fairly professional levels, are relatively self-contained affairs, burgeoning theater-practitioners have to search for new productions over and over.
Due to this pattern, students think that it could be utile to develop a more visible framework for support in that search, if only so that each prospective theater-maker’s foray into the professional [world might feels a little bit less isolated, a bit more communal. “I’m sure it would be helpful to have these network opportunities, these events where you have representatives from a bunch of companies or labs or whatever industry it might be coming in and talking about what they do to students,” Prosky says. “Certainly that sort of thing would be beneficial to the arts communities as well.”
For now, in the absence of a well-known and well-attended formal system for finding gigs, undergrads, at Harvard and elsewhere, are still finding success in expanding beyond their campuses. “Not only is Boston just a very cool, very artsy city with a lot of really exciting, interesting things happening, we also have so many universities around—so many colleges, so many schools,” Bergquist says. “You have a city that’s not only got such an investment in making good art, but also has so many young people and so many students who are freer to take risks and be creative, I think it’s really exciting what we get to be able to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was a student at Gainesville High School, a public city school in Northeast Georgia, I took a lot for granted. School pride, in particular, is something I should have appreciated more.
Last month, I spent just my second week back home since starting college two years ago, and I made sure to visit my high school, see my teachers and attend a Gainesville football game for the first time since graduating in 2013. That night, I gazed in awe as thousands of roaring fans cheered on our football team for the first game of the year. In that moment, I realized why I am so proud of my high school—why I am still so proud to be a Gainesville Red Elephant.
It is hard to be proud of Harvard. Not the idea of Harvard. I believe this is the best school on Earth. Not the students of Harvard. Folks here are among the brightest, most genuine, passionate people that I have ever met. No, it is hard for me to be proud of how Harvard is being run by our administration. Indeed, with all of Harvard’s name recognition, its academic resources, its funding, its powerful alumni, during my first two years here it was tough for me to understand why people at my public high-school seemed so much happier than people here. Why, after getting into the school of my dreams, did I feel such discontent? It just didn’t make sense.
This sense of discontent, of malaise, has been even more intense since the controversy erupted between Harvard’s administration and final clubs in the last few months. I have come to realize that, through its recent action (and decades of inaction), Harvard’s administration has let us down as a student body by failing to provide us with safe, accessible social avenues.
Now that student complaints have finally started to gain momentum, the administration is attempting to shift all of the blame onto unrecognized organizations, instead of taking responsibility for its own failures. Few will deny that the Spee's recent decision to make its organization co-ed is a form of progress, but this still fails to create social spaces on campus that are accessible to everyone. For the sake of our university’s culture and climate, Harvard’s administration must realize that it has shirked its responsibility.
Unlike many universities, Harvard refuses to recognize single-sex organizations such as fraternities, sororities, male final clubs, and female final clubs, and therefore prohibits them from being on campus. Some of these organizations still exist, but without any form of official oversight, parties here have legitimate safety concerns.
I am not a member of a final club. In all honesty, this article is not even really about final clubs. Rather, this is an article about how we as a student body must demand change from Harvard. If the administration is going to remove social spaces that fail to meet Harvard’s standards for inclusivity and safety, then it is the administration’s job to help create new spaces. We must remind our administration that its duty is to protect the social and mental well-being of all students on campus.
Further compounding this issue are the prices of real estate in the area. In Harvard Square, real estate prices are astronomically high, with an average sale price for homes of close to a million dollars. Even if a group of students wanted to create a new, safe social space with university oversight, this would be nearly impossible from a financial standpoint without active help from the administration.
Why not dorms? Over 97 percent of students live on campus all four years, so it might seem that there are plenty of on campus social spaces for us to gather. But as any undergraduate will unhappily tell you, that is simply not the case. Freshmen are not allowed to have any alcohol in their room, period, even if it just means sitting around drinking a beer. Designated “party rooms” such as the Currier Ten Man and the Pforzheimer Belltower are nice, but there is simply not enough space or University funding for these rooms to accommodate the hoards of students yearning for social release every weekend. Who here hasn’t experienced the freshmen wander, or hasn’t gotten used to parties with extremely imbalanced gender ratios, regardless of location? Who hasn’t, even once, wished they had gone to a school with a regular social scene?
Now that we have talked about our administration’s long history of inaction, let’s talk about the sweeping steps it has taken recently. After decades of near-silence, the administration has made the decision to adopt an outspoken stance against the clubs and to restrict their social activities. Having spoken with friends who have had negative experiences at organizations’ events, I do not doubt that many of the administration’s critiques are accurate. But, try as it might to distance itself from unaffiliated organizations, thereby avoiding legal liability, the mere fact that our administration is now heavily pressuring clubs from hosting parties shows that this separation is merely a façade. The administration must understand that it has been a major cause of, and thus is largely responsible for, the campus's current—shattered—state of social opportunities and student mental health.
Undergraduates, alumni, faculty, potential applicants and donors to Harvard University, it is time for all of us to put Harvard’s administration “on notice.”
It is time for the administration to publicly acknowledge its decades-long failure to act. It is time for them to take immediate steps to provide readily available and safe social spaces on campus. It is time for us to remind them that if our administration does not provide or encourage the establishment of safe avenues for students to enjoy themselves, it hinders our mental, social and physical well-being. It is time for them to know that we are young. That we are stressed. That we need some way to unwind after endless all-nighters, papers, and psets. That we yearn for some approximation of “actual college" life in this notoriously intense environment.
We are students. We are human. We are not just numbers on John Harvard’s stock portfolio. Let them know that it is time for John Harvard to invest just a tiny fraction of his 33 billion dollar endowment into students' social and mental wellbeing.
After we let the administration know all of this, let’s sit down and talk with them, work with them. Let’s talk about ways we can improve our time here. Let’s talk about how other institutions, such as the more robust college system at Yale and co-ed eating clubs at Princeton, do a better job with their social spaces. Let’s talk about ways that we can create spaces for students across campus to ease the intensity of the academic and professional pressure that we all feel here.
Harvard was founded in 1636 and will likely be around for many more centuries. But we are only here for four years. With this in mind, we must urge the administration to act now to provide us with new social spaces. It is time for them to stop talking about creating a new culture of inclusivity and acceptance and to start taking real steps towards getting us there.
Harvard is ours. Let’s work with the administration to help make our college balance the pressures of grades, papers, and GPA with safe down-time. Most of all, let’s work with the administration to help us make our school an institution that is worthy of our pride.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Grueling practice. High-stakes games. 40-plus hour weeks. But no pay. This leaves little doubt about the “amateur” quality that the NCAA, fans, and college administrators insist college athletes have. Their efforts lead to almost $11 billion in annual revenue for the college athletics industry—like engineers who make a successful product, but do not receive any compensation for their work. Athletes are the main reason the revenue comes in: It is their work ethic, determination, and talent that leads their teams to victory.
Arguments for paying athletes have traditionally focused on male football and basketball teams, and it is essential that those players receive a salary. The time they spend practicing compromises their academics; graduating debt free with a paper does not equate to a job post-graduation. Even scholarships can be revoked if a player is injured or decides to stop playing. Players can also get lifelong injuries that colleges may do nothing to compensate for.
Some argue Division I players receive a full scholarship plus access to top facilities and resources to make them superstars. But what percentage of college athletes go on to the pros? The NBA Draft only takes 60 players a year, and there are thousands of college players who do not have the opportunity to participate.
College athletics departments often weep about the lack of money they have to pay their players, generally because college football and basketball coaches have huge paychecks. In 39 states, the highest paid public employee is either a college football or basketball coach. These coaches earn more than governors and university presidents. Overall, the college football coaches at the top 32 football schools in the country are paid a greater proportion of their college football programs' revenue than NFL coaches are paid of their franchises'.
Colleges often argue that revenue comes in because coaches do an effective job recruiting top athletes, and that coaches serve as general managers and support systems for their players (NFL coaches do not). But the argument comes back to the athletes: They are the ones fans see on the field, not NCAA officials or college coaches.
If the revenues generated by each team are taken out of the argument, and only due compensation is considered, then all college athletes should be paid proportional to the amount of time and effort they put into the game.
Of course, this raises some difficult questions. For one thing, there are discrepancies in revenue generated and viewership between men’s and women’s sports. Over 28 million viewers tuned into watch the 2015 men’s NCAA Division I championship game, compared to 3.1 million who tuned in for the women’s championship. There's no doubt that women work just as much as men do, but because of the popularity of men’s sports, they do not experience the same success or popularity, and thus do not generate as much revenue. Where would the money to compensate them come from? What about Division II and III teams? Or any sport other than men’s basketball and football, where most proponents of paying college athletes focus their attention?
Then there is the issue of understanding athletics in the context of an extracurricular commitment. Conceivably, a recruited athlete can drop off the team, and athletes do, to an extent, understand what they are getting into when they sign up to play sports at a college. If we extend compensation beyond revenue, why not keep going for the violist who spends 40 hours a week practicing and performing, or the student who spends 40 hours volunteering, rather than the athlete who spends 40 hours on the field?
Spreading the revenue to other extracurriculars is a long shot, something that may never be achieved. But because of all the money that goes into sports, paying varsity athletes who put in significant time and effort should be a serious consideration for college athletic departments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I bought a record the other day with a price as insignificant as the name on the disk.
I started out by walking down the stairs in a blank corner of Mount Auburn Street. The walls smelled more like piss than the rest of Cambridge. I noticed good speakers, the kind that makes music more intimate than lust. Noticed what came out of them too—a liquid-smooth kind of rhythm, an uninviting and reckless shift of beats—though I couldn’t name the band. Spent a good half hour in the store. Kept trying to find something that would look pretty and simple on red brick walls. Settled on “Can’t Stop the Prophet” by Jeru the Damaja, not because I liked him or I had heard the song before. Liked, instead, the crisp white of the paper, the red sticker on the black record. Didn’t know much about Jeru the Damaja or the song on the disc. Only saw him two years ago in a video on Youtube arguing with Lauryn Hill, the only rapper I knew from the time period, and figured if he was sick enough to chill with L Boogie he’d be pretty enough to put on my wall. Didn’t think about it much after that, even when someone saw the vinyl gummed next to its cover on my red wall and asked about his albums, and I had next to nothing to say.
There are more examples to list, especially having to do with hip-hop, especially having to do with culture, especially having to do with art and the consumption of art. Like the men I sat next to in the theater for “Straight Outta Compton” who fist-pumped and bobbed their heads drunkenly to the music as if it were a concert, who replied to every part of the movie, regardless of emotional weight, with “isn’t this awesome” and “I loooooove this shiiiit.” Like non-black girls who wear dreadlocks for how it looks and how it feels. Like me, an Asian-American girl from middle-class suburban New Jersey, blasting Tupac while doing calculus homework or doodling “death is my sect guess my religion” when the closest encounter I had with the police was a “good morning” in the parking lot. Like all those self-proclaimed OGs in prestigious college campuses, white-as-cream suburbs, movie theaters, nightclubs, and libraries.
There is appropriation involved, but somehow that word seems too accusatory and defensive to be functional. It leaves you, and me, convinced that innocence needs a defense and there are few ways to claim it.
I won’t point out those aesthetic incongruities; they speak for themselves. I won’t point out repeated arguments that often sound liberal-biased, “ism”d and incomprehensible unless an appropriator has an extraordinary capacity for empathy, but more importantly, a good, liberal education. I will, instead, point out the intention of art, which becomes the main communicative device of culture.
There is a belief that art is for everybody to consume, which makes appropriation a topic that seems superficially sticky. Why limit the influence of art? Why limit a consumer? The belief is true, to some extent. Art supposedly has the ability to speak to the inner workings of the soul. It supposedly erases nuances, although momentarily, of race or gender or social class, to reveal what is the most critical, what is the most essential. And when art is for everybody to consume, art becomes profitable.
But art is not for everybody to consume. Art is meant to be understood more than consumed. And it’s to be understood in a human reality where “there is no greater pain than to be misunderstood” and “there is no greater pain than to be completely understood,” where “even internationally recognized artists can be invalidated with just one, ‘um…OK,’” where people scoff at blank canvases, where chewed-up wads of gum on Guggenheim floors are skirted around and observed as pieces of art because art no longer seems to exist with a nametag, where “[music] turned up in sterile bullshit clubs in LA, separated from the spirit we made it in."
Art is meant to be analyzed, but it is so hard to understand on a personal, emotional level. It requires an Avatar-like transformation where empathy becomes visceral. So it is so much easier for some art forms to be elite. It is so much easier to steal the flash and bang of aesthetics from Makavelli than Machiavelli; to scribble “Thug Life” on a desk than to look up all the political and social references in a song like “Thugz Mansion”; to use the description OG instead of making up one for yourself. But art doesn’t exist for people to like it.
Art is created to be understood. It is meant to be consumed by people who want to respect it. And perhaps a lack of this relationship is what resonates with me most in cases of appropriation—a lack of respect manifesting in a refusal to admit that some types of art should be treated as art.
I notice how subtly acts of appropriation occur, and I wish interests, preferences, and attractions were not so political. However, when the vinyl gets taped on my wall, when another rap album rolls through my speakers, when I bob my head to a beat, I’ll notice more. How the groove lays intentionally in the crevices of noise. How spoken word can stick to the mind. How lyrics seem careful in their careless construction or careless in their careful construction. How beautiful it is to admire the work of a person I can never be, in a culture I can never claim.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The current conflict in Syria—between the government forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and various rebel groups—has displaced over four million refugees, most of whom have fled into neighboring countries; in particular, Turkey and Lebanon have borne the brunt of the crisis, with over a million refugees in various camps within those countries. News coverage of this crisis in the West has heightened in recent weeks and months due to a series of tragic incidents and the decisions by various European countries to open their borders to Syrian refugees. In the face of mounting pressure, the White House announced last Thursday that the United States would welcome at least 10,000 more Syrian refugees.
This is clearly insufficient—10,000 refugees is a mere fraction of those displaced by the conflict, many of whom are currently living in destitute conditions in refugee camps. It is incumbent on Western nations and Gulf states to relocate the Syrian refugees, both because it is the right thing to do and because of the risk in keeping four million people in permanent state of poverty and lack of access to resources.
Even with last week’s announcement, the United States could still play a more proactive role in combating the current crisis by admitting more refugees into the country and by cooperating with its allies in the region to make living conditions in the existing camps less harsh. There have been various calls for the U.S. to accept more refugees—with numbers ranging from 65,000 to 100,000. Other nations—in Western Europe and in the Middle East—should take similar steps as well if they have not already done so, and especially if they have the wealth and resources to handle an influx of refugees. The dire situation in existing camps puts a moral imperative on the West and the wealthier Arab states to address the crisis in a humanitarian way.
It is, of course, not a simple solution, for the U.S. or for other nations: Resettling such a large number of refugees presents a difficult problem. A state willing to provide shelter also needs to bear the cost of providing housing, employment and social benefits. Similarly, an influx of a large number of migrants may be followed by ethnic tensions fueled by anti-immigrant sentiment.
Nevertheless, the consequences and potential risks of not lending aid far outweigh the costs. Leaving four million refugees to suffer in the poor living conditions of refugee camps with little in the way of resource or recourse is not an option.
Resettlement, however, would not provide a long-term solution to the Syrian crisis; the flood of refugees out of that region will likely only escalate as conflicts in Syria and Iraq continue. Ideally, any solution for the relocation of refugees would be coupled with more comprehensive, more aggressive, and less reactive strategy for dealing with violence in the region.
The risks that Syrian refugees are taking to flee from that violence reflect the gravity of their situation. Leaving the displaced in impoverished conditions is certain to pose further complications to the already volatile situation in the Middle East. The onus is on the United States and European and Arab countries to help solve this crisis.

The College will fund small groups of students and faculty members to dine together at restaurants throughout Harvard Square as part of a new effort to develop stronger relationships between students and professors.
The new pilot program, dubbed “Classroom to Table," provides funding for students and faculty members to dine at one of several Harvard Square eateries: Grafton Street, Park Restaurant, Russell House Tavern, and Uno Pizzeria & Grill. The Office of Undergraduate Education will cover the cost of the meal up to $20 per person and independently receives a charge from restaurant management.
"The opportunity is to help students and their professors engage outside of the classroom on topics that might come up in the class in which they encounter each other or might be related or might be quite different, but fosters the possibility of a further discussion in any number of directions," said Noel Bisson, the College's associate dean of undergraduate education.
The program brings together a series of ideas proposed by several faculty members and students in recent months, Bisson said.
Sharon Zhou ’15 presented one such proposal last May to Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 along with the support of Eliot House Master Douglas A. Melton. Zhou’s idea came from her own experience connecting faculty members in different departments, she said.
“Freshman year, one of my Classics professors and one of my Linguistics professors both were really interested in Slavic languages, but they didn't know each other even though they were both in Boylston and only one floor apart. So I connected them at a tea event,” Zhou said.
Although administrators at the Office of Undergraduate Education expect that students will begin using the program to engage with a singular professor, they will provide flexibility for other arrangements, according to a College-wide email about the program from Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. Faculty members might also host students across a variety of courses, or a group of students might bring together two different faculty members, as Zhou suggested.
“We’re at Harvard, and we have all this knowledge everywhere, and if it’s all siloed, we’re not tapping into all of the interdisciplinary, creative, innovative ideas,” Zhou said.
For now, administrators are publicizing the program as an experiment, and the Office of Undergraduate Education is still considering ways to measure its success, acknowledging the possibility of expansion.
“We are testing it right now with the belief and some expectation that there will be real benefit to having this kind of conversation fostered between students and faculty. We can only imagine that it would be beneficial,” Bisson said.

Donning hard hats, Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 and Samuel G. Greenberg ’14 showed off the vacant space in the basement of First Parish Church that will soon house Y2Y Harvard Square, the nation’s first student-run shelter for homeless youth. 
Much demolition and construction work remained to be done, but Rosenkrantz and Greenberg said that Y2Y Harvard Square will be fully operational by November.
The anticipated November start date falls roughly a year and a half after Rosenkrantz and Greenberg first launched the youth shelter initiative. By November, the two co-directors plan not only to open the youth shelter but also hope to reach their $1.25 million capital fundraising goal.
Co-directors Greenberg and Rosenkrantz are working with Essex Newbury North contracting company, Skanska USA, and Studio G architects to manage construction and complete the design model. A total of 10 contractors and subcontractors have made significant donations, of both material and labor, to contribute to the renovation of the shelter.
According to the design model, the shelter will be equipped with a welcome desk, 25 beds, single-stall bathrooms, a kitchen, a medical room, and a common space.
“What we thought about prioritizing were safety, dignity, and affirmation and… we thought it was critical that we have a large, flexible multi-use space,” Greenberg said.
When the shelter is officially open to the public, guests will be given beds on a lottery based system similar to that of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
“There are only 12 beds for young adults in Greater Boston and many more people who need those beds, and we felt that making a judgment call on vulnerability or putting a hierarchy on need wasn’t something we wanted to do,” Rosenkrantz said.
Greenberg and Rosenkrantz are in the process of completing a 30-person staff in the next few weeks. Currently, staff positions are occupied by Harvard students, although the positions are open to all students in the Cambridge area. 
Rosencrantz said that she and Greenberg are beginning to step back in order to give students working at the shelter leadership experience, in preparation for when the two co-directors leave.
“We want to make sure that things are running smoothly and to make sure that they feel ready and prepared to take ownership of the shelter,” Rosenkrantz said.

UPDATED: September 14, 2015, at 10:09 p.m.
The Harvard Square location of Yogurtland, a self-service frozen yogurt store, has shuttered its doors after two years of operation. A small but passionate and vocal group of longtime student-patrons who frequented Yogurtland while it was in business described themselves as heartbroken over the closure. 
“I was actually devastated. I was genuinely devastated. Yogurtland for me as a freshman, was a place of solace,” said Lulu S. Chua-Rubenfeld ’18.
Unlike other frozen yogurt options near Harvard Square, Yogurtland was self-service style and featured a wall displaying 16 flavors and a bar with more than 60 options for toppings.
“Pinkberry is not self-serve, you've got all these complications of lines, you don't get immediate access to the yogurt, it's hard to sample,” Jon D. Young '16 said. “The same issues plague the Berryline, the J.P. Licks, and what have you.”
Young is a platinum level member of the rewards program, a distinction he earned after consuming more than 240 ounces of frozen yogurt over the course of his frequent visits to the store.
“Yogurtland was the holy place for me,” Young said. “My temple, if you will.”
The affordable price and wide range of flavors was particularly appealing for college students, some students said.
“There is really no price point that excludes the consumer from walking into Yogurtland and enjoying a tasty treat,” Young said. “There's a flavor for everyone...It is far more egalitarian than any other framework of yogurt service in Cambridge at the moment."
Chua-Rubenfeld agreed, saying, “I was really upset when I heard it closed because Berryline and Pinkberry are very expensive and not self-serve.”
Other students praised Yogurtland’s quick service and various amenities.
“I didn’t want to wait forever,” said Patrick H. Pan ’18, which he said was a common experience at the “super crowded” Pinkberry located on Massachusetts Avenue. He also added that he was a fan of the berry water offered for free.
The chain, which opened its first store in 2006, is based in Irvine, Calif. Amidst high growth in the popularity of frozen yogurt, Yogurtland expanded to locations throughout the United States and internationally, although its presence is still strongest on the West Coast.
To Derek E. Ponce ’18, who is from California, Yogurtland’s frozen yogurt options were a sweet reminder of home.
“We have a lot of [Yogurtlands] out there, so that was kind of like a nice way to like keep some California here,” he said.
Despite the closure of the Harvard Square location, some students managed to find a silver lining in the situation.
“I may have lost Yogurtland in Cambridge, but I know that it's out there representing around the country,” Young said. “I pray for its corporate success.”

On the heels of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ rollout of the new my.harvard portal, students who failed to turn in their study cards on time last week will not have to pay the $40 late fee.
Based on initial enrollment data, about 1 percent of undergraduates did not submit their study cards by last Thursday’s deadline, a number that FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said is “right in line with prior semesters.” 
For the first time, undergraduates enrolled in their courses online this fall through the recently overhauled my.harvard website, a departure from the Registrar’s previous method of collecting of paper study cards. The new system automatically registers whether or not students have enrolled and charges them accordingly, Burke said.
The new portal, which includes a course catalog, has several new features, but some students struggled to use it during shopping period.
For now, following the new site’s rollout, the Registrar’s Office has removed the feature that automatically sends students bills for not submitting their study cards on time.
“We’re leaning towards maximum lenience at this point until we fully understand what’s making some students late,” Burke said
The new my.harvard system has frustrated some undergraduates, who complained about technical challenges and the need to wait for virtual approval from advisers and course instructors before enrolling in classes and submitting a final study card.
Madison M. Dildine ’16, who did not submit her study card on time, said she ran into issues with the website when she went to enroll. My.harvard took her in loops, she said, prompting her to miss the submission deadline. She still is waiting for three professors to “approve” her course plans before she can enroll for the semester.
“It mostly overall was kind of confusing and has not worked with my internet,” Dildine said. “It was just kind of annoying… I can’t section for my classes yet, because I’m not officially enrolled in the classes.”
The add/drop period, when students can change their course schedules, starts this week and continues through Sept. 21. After that date, students will be charged a fee for enrolling in new courses or dropping old ones from their schedules.
“That fee will persist this semester, but again, we’re going to be deliberate about it to make sure that there’s not something preventing students from getting work done,” Burke said.

Stanley Hoffmann, an iconic voice in international relations who taught generations of top scholars in his more than half century at Harvard, died in his sleep on Saturday night. He was 86. 
“Stanley was above all, in his heart and soul, a teacher—one of the most devoted and influential teachers in Harvard’s modern history," Government professor Michael J. Sandel, a longtime colleague and friend of Hoffmann, wrote in an email.
The founding chair of the Center for European Studies who published 19 books, Hoffmann was known for his interdisciplinary approach to political science and his role in helping to create the Social Studies concentration in 1960.
“He was one of a kind; he will be missed by everyone in the Harvard community who was lucky enough to know him,” History professor James T. Kloppenberg, the current chair of the Committee for Degrees on Social Studies, wrote in an email.
Hoffmann’s academic legacy lives on through the many students and colleagues who were influenced by his work. According to History professor Charles S. Maier ’60, a former Crimson editorial chair, most of the top scholars in European affairs of his generation came through Hoffmann’s CES at some point in their careers.
Hoffmann’s voice still answers the main line of the Center for European Studies, his polished, slightly accented English telling callers that they can dial the extension of the person they are calling if they know it.
At a party to commemorate his retirement in 2013, Suzanne Berger, a professor of political science at MIT, also drew attention to the continuity of his voice.
“Hoffmann’s lectures taught me that the real teacher is the voice one hears for life. When I’m doing my own work today, I still hear the voice of that teacher wondering, challenging, posing the hardest questions. I always will,” she said.
His colleagues remember him for his generosity. Government professor Peter A. Hall recalled that during his days as a graduate student, Hoffmann’s CES served as an “oasis of egalitarianism” in an otherwise stratified Harvard.
Though he taught at Harvard from 1955 until his retirement in 2013, “history had slapped him around quite a bit beforehand,” in the words of one of his many former students, Dartmouth history professor Anne Sa’adah.
Born in Vienna on Nov. 27, 1928, Hoffmann soon moved to France where he lived through the Nazi occupation before collecting a degree from Institut d’Etudes Politiques in 1948 and spending a year as a visiting scholar at Harvard.
“He was equal parts political scientist and humanist,” said Sa’adah, remembering his advice to students hoping understand the revolutions of 1848 to read Gustave Flaubert.
Hoffmann also famously assigned the entirety of Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” for a class on war. According to Maier, who was a teaching fellow for that course, the logic behind such lengthy readings was that while students assigned 200 pages would actually complete 100, those assigned 1000 pages would read 600.
One of Hoffmann’s most persistent vocal idiosyncrasies, according to Sa’adah, was his tendency to connect two different ideas using “on the one hand…, but on the other hand…” His students often joked that were his hands tied behind his back, he would be unable to say anything.
This tendency to see both sides was not limited to his scholarship. In the aftermath of the occupation of University Hall in 1969, according to Maier and reports from the time, Hoffmann disagreed with both the students’ tactics and the administration’s decision to call in the police.
“Stanley was always in the middle. And it’s uncomfortable in the middle,” Maier said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Students briefly evacuated Kirkland and Eliot Houses on Monday evening after a small electrical fire broke out in a walk-in refrigerator between the Houses’ dining halls, according to Sergeant Daniel Brown of Harvard police.
The fire broke out around 6:45 p.m., triggering fire alarms in Kirkland. Shortly after, students were evacuated from both houses.
Dawn Loggins ’16, an Eliot resident who was in the dining hall at the time of the evacuation, said the fire alarm was initially met with uncertainty. Students had gathered there eating dinner, she said, when a kitchen staff member called for them to leave.
“On the way out you could see smoke coming from the kitchens,” Loggins said.
The Cambridge Fire Department responded “within five minutes,” according to Aditya N. Prasad ’17, a Kirkland resident.
For some students, the fire posed a temporary distraction to Monday night plans.
“I have a problem set that I have to get done,” Shaan K. Erickson ’17 said. 
“So do I. I ran up and got my work,” Prasad added.
Colin D. Criss ’17, who was sitting on the porch in the Eliot courtyard, said he enjoyed watching the fire trucks at work.
“I love fire trucks,” said Criss, who added that he frequently watches firefighters at work in his home state of New York. “Hopefully the kitchen is okay.”
Students could re-enter Kirkland and Eliot at about 7:50 p.m., when they could briefly return to the dining halls.
Both affected dining halls, however, will be closed Tuesday for cleaning, according to Winthrop House administrator Heather Grant, who emailed Winthrop residents warning them that their dining hall might be more crowded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 15, 2015, at 10:38 p.m.
Applicants to colleges and universities may apply for federal financial aid starting Oct. 1 next year, meaning students will have access to information about financial aid possibilities more than two months earlier than under the old system.
In previous years, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, was available starting Jan. 1, when many schools’ regular decision applications are due. The new availability date will “allow students and families to apply for financial aid earlier—starting in October as the college application process gets underway—rather than in January,” the White House said in a statement released Sunday.
An additional change to FAFSA includes a feature for high school students to fill out the application using information provided electronically by the Internal Revenue Service several months after their families file for tax returns.
According to a press release, federal government officials seek to give families information about their children’s financial aid possibilities sooner while also simplifying the application process. Throughout his tenure, President Barack Obama has prioritized simplifying FAFSA.
In early 2014, officials from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform alleged that Harvard was misleading its applicants by encouraging them to fill out forms in addition to FAFSA. The College currently uses CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, a system under purview of the College Board, to determine financial aid from Harvard alone.
FAFSA remains the only tool for students looking to receive federal aid. While the government’s application is free, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE costs up to $25 per school. Members of the House committee criticized Harvard for persuading students to fill out both applications “without any explanation of use or purpose.”
University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in 2014 that because nearly every student filling out the forms is eligible for both federal and Harvard-specific financial aid, it is “important that nearly every aid applicant completes both forms.”
According to Parke P. Muth, a college admissions counselor and a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia, a large number of educators see the changes to FAFSA as a positive step.
“Some of these forms are daunting for tax lawyers, let alone other people,” Muth said. “Simplifying the process so that people can fill them out and receive the aid they’re eligible for seems like, to many people, a very wise thing to do.”
While Muth lauded the White House for the changes, he added that the next step needs to be a comprehensive look at raw data.
In the case of an increase in the number of students filling out FAFSA, he said, “in one sense that’s a triumph,” but in another, it could possibly decrease the amount of aid that each individual student receives, as schools have a limited amount of money allotted for financial aid purposes.

Finance experts say that despite both domestic and international market volatility, the Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s $35.9 billion endowment, should stay its course and not make drastic changes to investment portfolio.
Steven N. Kaplan ’81, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said that in times with rapidly changing prices and unexpected turns, it would be unwise for a large-scale financial institution to change course.
“The worst thing you can do when there is volatility is panic and change what you are doing,” Kaplan said. “So I would basically just ignore what has happened over the last couple of months as long as I was confident that I had the right asset allocation and the right amount of diversification. Just ignore it.”
David L. Yermack ’85, professor of finance at the New York University Stern School of Business, echoed Kaplan’s comments, emphasizing the importance of minimizing risk in all possible forms for the guaranteed long-term health of the University.
“It’s inevitable that you will have volatility in the market, but an investor as large as HMC should really be a buy-and-hold investor, not try to trade around that,” Yermack said. “There is no real strategy to outrun something that is just in the nature of investing in stocks and bonds.”
In its current model, HMC, led by CEO Stephen Blyth, manages risk through what it calls its Policy Portfolio, or a defined allocation of where the Company will invest. Every year in September, the Management Company announces the Policy Portfolio for the upcoming fiscal year, with changes to the asset allocation breakdown explained by CEO of HMC.
The upcoming report from HMC will be Blyth’s first as CEO. He took over in January from Jane L. Mendillo, who led HMC through the crisis but struggled to return the fund’s returns to the top of the pack.
Kaplan suggested that HMC has overreacted to volatility in the past, particularly during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
“If you go back to the financial crisis in late 2008 and early 2009? They panicked and sold equity,” Kaplan added. “That was the worst time to sell equity because the equity markets have done extremely well since then.”
When the markets fell off, HMC was unable to provide enough liquidity to give full support to all of Harvard’s budgets. Even despite the emergency cost-cutting measures undertaken by Harvard deans, HMC’s liquid assets—or assets that can quickly be exchanged for cash—were insufficient. This forced HMC to start selling off some of its long-term illiquid assets, such as private equity and real estate investments, at the bottom of the market. In 2009, HMC saw endowment returns of negative 27.3 percent, a value of roughly $11 billion.
Five years removed from the crisis, HMC is still a player in private equity, and its place in the portfolio has only increased. Its fiscal 2015 allocation to the asset class was 18 percent, up from 16 percent in fiscal 2014 and 11 percent in fiscal 2008, on the eve of the crisis.
“We believe that targeted and judicious exposure to [private equity] can lead to higher returns; and ... while the portfolio experienced liquidity constraints over the past five to six years, the liquidity profile of the endowment is now improved, allowing us to strategically increase our position in illiquid assets,” Mendillo wrote in the September 2014 annual endowment report, her last in charge.
While Kaplan, a private equity expert himself, said that the private equity market is healthy if somewhat saturated, Yermack expressed concern about the increased commitment to private equity investments and the heightened risk that goes along with it.
“I think that private equity is something of a racket. Managers do very well in terms of the fees that they collect but their ability to choose good investments is not particularly impressive,” Yermack said. “So I don’t think HMC or any other endowment should be giving money to private equity, if any.”
With the September 2015 endowment report due for release soon, Blyth will put his firmest public stamp yet on HMC’s direction, determining its plan for the upcoming year and addressing not only private equity but also the lingering speculation over when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 70 students and faculty gathered on Monday evening for the kick-off event for Gender Inclusivity in Mathematics, a new organization devoted to discussing issues facing women and other underrepresented groups studying mathematics. 
Inspired by the large attendance at a similar event hosted by the Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association in April, three students co-founded the group to continue confronting gender-based challenges in the field.
“We just felt like we had to do something, because so many people were rallied around this issue,” said Meena K. Boppana ’16, one of the founders, who started the group following work on a final project for a Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality course. Vikram Sundar ’18 and Amanda K. Glazer ’18 also helped found the group.
Two Harvard-educated mathematicians spoke at Monday’s event, the first in a bi-weekly series hosted by the group.
Cathy O’Neil, a former Barnard College professor who earned a Ph.D. from Harvard, and Moon Duchin ’97, a former math and women’s studies concentrator who is now an associate professor at Tufts, gave advice to aspiring mathematicians during their talk.
“Women-in-math support groups can be good because they get you thinking about the issues, but also a problem because they get you thinking about the issues,” Duchin said, comparing the dilemma to looking at your feet when walking on a tightrope and getting caught up in the difficulty of the task.
Having worked in academia, they also discussed the how giving awards or grants to underrepresented minorities in math may aggravate the gender gap.
“At the [University of] Chicago, they give a best dissertation prize, and they give a best dissertation by a woman prize. Does anyone see how that’s a little problematic?” Duchin asked. Both speakers suggested that such distinctions set aside the regular position for the “white man,” but also allow minorities to more proportional representation.
The speakers further recounted various experiences that had taught them lessons about not being afraid of voicing their thoughts despite the risk of humiliation.
“You learn more when you ask questions, because you’re putting yourself at risk. Not just because you might look stupid, but because you’re actually responsible for understanding the explanation,” O’Neil said.

This past weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team kicked off its fall season by hosting the UTR Boston Open, which brought together local college players, top Boston-area juniors, as well as current and former ATP professionals.
The entire Crimson roster competed in the tournament, except for freshman Christopher Morrow and sophomores Kenny Tao and Grant Solomon, who sat with minor injuries.
The Harvard players performed well against a strong field, placing five in the quarterfinals. Two team members—co-captain Nicky Hu and junior Sebastian Beltrameadvancing as far as the semifinals.
The UTR Boston Open represented not only an opportunity for the Crimson to tune up for its fall campaign, but also served as a new, more inclusive model of tennis tournament, according to Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72, who is entering his 40th season of coaching the Crimson.
The tournament was organized around the Universal Tennis Rating system, a scale analogous to a golf handicap, that allows professionals, college competitors, juniors, and women alike to compete in the same “open” tournament.
“This tournament puts players together independent of age, but rather based on skill level,” Fish said. “Now all compete in the same competitive format. It lets less experienced players compete in the early rounds, and professionals can come in the later rounds and play for prize money. At each level, the carrot is appropriate, and the goal is to make tennis more accessible, affordable, and to have better competition for all.”
In this “open” format, Harvard placed well, as Hu and Beltrame were seeded third and fourth, respectively, in a field that included top seed, an ATP pro, and second-seeded Harshana Godamanna, who used to compete for the Sri Lankan Davis Cup squad.
“It was a pretty good weekend, especially considering how strong the number one and two seeds were,” junior Brian Yeung said. “The whole team got some good matches in.”
The Crimson, which finished second in the Ivy League, has only just begun its fall season, as it kicked off captains’ practices this past Thursday in advance of the weekend tournament.
Next weekend, Harvard will send some of the team to the Connecticut Open, and the rest will compete at the Ivy Plus Tournament at Princeton.
These early fall tournaments, and especially the Ivy Plus Tournament, where the Crimson will get its first look at its Ancient Eight competition, are primarily intended as a “freshman showcase,” according to Yeung.
Thus far, the returns for the team’s four freshmen are impressive, with Yeung singling out St. Louis, Mo., native Michael Peters as having a particularly good weekend.
Fish echoed Yeung’s sentiments about the freshman class.
“They won a lot of good matches and competed well,” Fish said. “But mostly, they got flooded early and got a taste of competition. It was a great low-key event and they will all continue to get better, but right now they’re drinking from the fire hydrant, so we don’t expect too much from them.”

Tom Purnell, a co-captain of the Harvard men’s cross country team, opened up his last season as a member of the Crimson by pulling out a first-place finish in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet on home turf at Franklin Park in Boston this past Friday.
Purnell beat out Princeton rival William Bertrand in the last 100 meters of the men’s 8K race and finished with a final time of 24 minutes, 48 seconds, just one second ahead of the Tiger.
Overall, the men’s cross country team tied for second place at the meet, while the women’s squad took home the championship by a one-point margin.
Although he placed third overall at the same HYP meet as a sophomore, Purnell failed to crack the top 20 in his junior season, finishing fifth out of all Crimson runners in the race.
But the Gloucestershire, U.K., native’s new winning habits are not just the work of skill.
Purnell’s co-captain, Chris Allen, praised Purnell’s work ethic and noted that he is the first one to practice and the last to leave.
“Tom is a very good role model,” Allen said. “He is definitely someone that the [under]classmen look up to, especially [since] that we don’t have a lot of upperclassmen right now. Everyone looks up to him as one of the best runners on the team. We have a lot of young blood, and a lot of emotion and excitement.”
The Norfolk, Mass., native noted how Purnell shows a level of dedication that his teammates should emulate.
“As someone who’s lived with Tom for the past couple of years, he is very dedicated to his sport,” Allen said. “He eats well, gets his sleep, and is always ready to go at practice.”
In 2014, Purnell was a lone bright spot for the Crimson team.
In the Battle of Beantown, the senior finished 13th of 185 runners. At last year’s Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, Purnell stood in second place at the 3K split, ultimately finishing eighth overall.
At the NCAA Regional Championships in Riverdale, N.Y., the captain finished 17th overall, good enough for a spot at the NCAA National Championships in Terre Haute, Ind.
As a co-captain with experience on the national scale — the senior finished 170th as the only Crimson runner to qualify for the NCAA National Championships last season — Purnell sets the tone for a promising team with a lot of young blood.
As a team, the Harvard men’s side boast 17 underclassmen and just four seniors.
Last season was a disappointment for the Crimson team, with the men finishing seventh of eight at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships and having only one runner reaching the National Championships. In 2013, the squad qualified for the NCAA Championships as a team,finishing 30th in the country.
“Last year, myself and the team ran pretty badly,” Purnell said. “I knew how important it was to run well this week. We’ve got a much better feel to the team this year, a much better attitude. I’m looking forward to qualifying for Nationals and getting a shot at All-American.”
Knowing this will be his final year running for Harvard, Purnell is taking it on himself to help rebuild a team that disappointed for most of last season.
For the senior, there is no better time than now to ensure that he and his teammates have their sights set on the same goals.
The team is set to build upon its first meet and to continue to improve, and the Crimson know that its success will depend heavily on Purnell.
“I’ve been the number one guy for two years now,” said Purnell. “I never skip out on anything or take anything easy at practice. It’s on me to be a low scorer in all of our meets.”
With Purnell at the forefront, Harvard cross country is looking to make waves in the Ivy League and ultimately to compete at the national level.
“He is a gifted athlete who has really taken his training and dedication to another level,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “He is a great example of what it takes to compete against the nation’s best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 15, 2015, at 12:23 pm
When Stony Brook senior Martin Giordano’s 77th minute shot pulled the Seawolves even with the Harvard men’s soccer team Sunday evening, it appeared as though yet another chapter had been added to a familiar Crimson narrative.
For the fourth time in as many tries to open the year, Harvard found itself on the verge of conceding the game’s final goal, watching another potential victory begin to slip away. But five minutes later, the Crimson finally managed to turn the page.
After receiving a pass on a counter-attack from freshman forward Cesar Farias, senior forward Jake Freeman stared down his defender from the edge of the 18-yard box.
Then with one quick step to his left, the Long Island native gained enough separation to send a long shot sliding across the wet turf and into the lower left corner of the net, lifting Harvard (1-2-1) to its first victory of 2015.
“I thought we responded really well,” Freeman said. “We were definitely a little shocked, but at the same time, we all came together like we do after every goal that’s scored against us and we just said, ‘Nothing changes. We’re going to go out the same way. Let’s just try to get our chances to take over the game like we know we can.’ And in the end, it worked out.”
With the 2-1 win, the Crimson has now beaten Stony Brook (1-3-1) in consecutive seasons.
Last year, Harvard upended the Seawolves at home by a score of 2-0 behind two goals from then-junior defender Philip Fleischman, one of which was assisted by Freeman.
Fleischman had not scored since that contest last Oct. 28—that is, until Sunday. Finding just enough space to work with inside the box, the senior put the Crimson in front in the 27th minute, redirecting a long throw-in from senior midfielder Michael Klain with his head past junior goalkeeper Jason Orban.
The goal marked the first time Harvard had struck first in a game all season, but it also represented one of the few bright spots in a half largely controlled by the hosts.
Stony Brook outshot the Crimson, 7-2, in the frame, generating dangerous scoring chances inside the box on multiple occasions. However, the Seawolves could only keep one of their seven shots on target, leaving the door open for Harvard to capitalize.
Stony Brook continued to struggle with its shooting accuracy in the second half, missing the net on four out of its five attempts.
But the Seawolves were not missing by much. Sophomore Danny Espinoza nearly came up with an equalizer in the 62nd minute, but his dipping shot from 24 yards out bounced off the post.
The hosts’ efforts finally came to fruition in the 77th minute, when Giordano produced a highlight-reel caliber goal to even things up at one.
With sophomore Thibault Duval’s cross dipping into the box, Giordano ran left towards the ball before lunging at it with his right foot. Then with his back to Crimson goaltender Evan Mendez in the midst of a 360 degree spin, Giordano squeezed a shot just inside the near post to bring the score to 1-1.
Giordano’s goal put the Seawolves in a position to extend their unbeaten streak at home to three games, but Freeman had other ideas. His 82nd minute winner was his second goal of the season.
“Jake’s a fantastic finisher,” Fleischman said. “He’s definitely a guy who’s had a good, fast start to the season, and hopefully he can use that through the rest of the season because he has the ability to.”
Freeman nearly got on the board in the first half as well. With the game still scoreless, the senior generated his side’s first shot on goal, forcing Orban to make a diving stop to his left from inside the box.
Orban’s initial save sent the ball spinning into the air in the direction of the goal a second time, but the keeper made another sprawling save, this time to his right, to keep the Crimson off the scoreboard.
Nonetheless, behind the two goals that followed, Harvard earned its first win of the season in its fourth attempt for the second year in a row.
Fleischman pointed to the way Harvard’s nonconference opponents kick off their seasons earlier than Ivy League squads as a potential explanation.
“It’s always a challenge for us as an Ivy League team to start the season [at] a fast pace winning a bunch of games,” Fleischman said. “So I guess it’s been a trend that it takes us a couple games to find our groove, but I’m definitely excited at the prospect of getting out of this week and really charging through the early part of the season here.”

Today, the senior class will begin electing the senior Class Marshals. If you happen to use a little something called Facebook, you’ve probably received about a dozen or so invitations to vote for various senior leaders, who all boast similar platforms of making events for the graduating class and making this, if you are a senior in the Class of 2016, the best! year! yet! The question remains however, what exactly is a senior class marshal? Why is the position so coveted? Why should we care? Luckily, Flyby has done some research into the topic and has you covered:
According to the Harvard Alumni website, eight class marshals are elected every year. These marshals include the First and Second Marshals, who earn the most votes respectively and serve as essentially "class president" and "vice president," as well as six Program Marshals. The group's goal, along with the rest of the Senior Class Committee, is to "bring the Class together as a whole, connecting members of the Class of 2016 to each other and Harvard College by modeling and facilitating communication, participation, volunteerism, and giving among classmates." Their tasks among other things include organizing senior year events, such as all of the senior week activities, Class Day, the senior soiree, and class reunions (which if choosing a class marshal applies to you, probably makes you feel old). Basically, it appears that class marshals are responsible for a lot of the fun senior-specific events. It’s a little bit like what the Crimson Key is for freshmen, except also not.
Class marshals appear to have a lot of influence over the series of fun events for seniors' last moments here as well as post-grad get-togethers, so if you’re graduating this year, vote today for the First and Second Class Marshals! 
P.S. Oh yeah, last year’s First Class Marshal was Sietse K. Goffard '15, and there is currently a small movement on Facebook to re-elect him again, because “nothing broke last time.”
