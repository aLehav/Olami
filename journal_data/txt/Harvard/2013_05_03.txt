After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The whispers get stronger. The rumors fly. The internet posts are getting even more ridiculously speculative. The question remains: Will she or won’t she?
I refer, of course, to the question everyone is asking: Will Hillary Clinton run for President of the United States or not? Is Hillary 2016 going to happen? Unfortunately, I have no insight into what Clinton is thinking right now, especially since she never responded to my text. However, I do know that if she decides to run, she will have an army of women and girls supporting her who are ready for this next step. I campaigned for Clinton for the 2008 election and while I felt a lot of support at the time, it is nothing compared to the palpable and fervent energy in the air already surrounding 2016. Almost every time Clinton comes up in conversation these days around young women, it is completely common to hear “I’ll drop everything if she runs in 2016. Nothing will stop me from working on that campaign.” This type of enamored dedication was missing from her last campaign, and this is precisely why she needs to run.
There are many other reasons why Clinton should go for it. She has the experience to know what works and what doesn’t. She has earned it more than anyone else out there right now. Most recently, she was a fantastic Secretary of State. From establishing diplomatic ties with Burma to supporting crucial air strikes in Libya, and including her constant and unending work to champion and improve the rights of women around the world, Clinton did an extraordinary job. She strove to make sure that the U.S. was engaged throughout the world, and set a strong example herself—she is the only Secretary of State to have ever travelled to over a hundred countries in her tenure.
Clinton was impressive before she was Secretary of State, as well—formidable first lady, exceptional senator, charismatic leader—but it is her tenure as America’s top diplomat that has made people realize how much they both like and respect her. It was an unfortunately common thing to hear during the 2008 campaign that Clinton was simply not as likable as Obama. Even though she stood out incredibly in her own right, she was still associated with her husband. Although Bill Clinton’s record as president was admirable, many saw him as a negative element to her run. Now, times have changed. People are embracing Hillary’s badassitude. Forget Sheryl Sandberg—Clinton’s been leaning in for decades. Women I talk to on Harvard’s campus gush about her role as the ultimate power woman. This type of adoration was missing the first time she ran. She had her dedicated fan base but now it seems as though she is literally a rock star. And in the words of Tina Fey, Bill Clinton is now only exciting because, oh my god, he’s “Hillary Clinton’s husband!” Finally, the spotlight is all hers.
From James Carville’s support of a pro-Hillary Super PAC, “Ready for Hillary,” to the social media fan pages popping up every day, the excitement continues to build. “Ready For Hillary” is a perfect name to describe this movement. The younger generation that I found so hesitant to campaign for Clinton in 2008 has no qualms now—Clinton is suddenly cool. And yet, we must not let this momentum drop. If many members of this country are proclaiming that we are ready for Hillary, then we must prove it. We cannot just say we’ll drop everything to campaign; when the time comes, we must do it. We cannot merely refer to Clinton as a power woman; we must shout it and write it on signs across the country. We must not be afraid to defend her, especially if people insist on criticizing her pantsuits or her makeup. If we are ready for Hillary, then we must be ready to fight against the misogynistic blather that so disfigured the mainstream media last time.
I want an exceptional, innovative president in 2016. For me, this means that I want Hillary Clinton. (The fact that she’s a woman is merely a cherry on top of a delicious cake). For everyone else who feels the same way, when the time comes, let’s not take no for an answer. If we’re ready for Hillary, we need to let her know now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When protestors at Dartmouth loudly disrupted an event for admitted students almost two weeks ago, they probably believed that they could draw attention to and begin to resolve recent incidents of homophobia, sexual assault, and racism on Dartmouth’s campus. Instead, their actions seem to have driven Dartmouth’s campus further apart, precipitating anonymous threats against the protestors on the student website, Bored at Baker. Dartmouth’s response—to replace classes with diversity programming for a day—was not effective, either. One day of discussion cannot resolve the problem that sparked the protests and responses to them. To make matters worse, Dartmouth has yet to announce how they will improve campus dialogue on diversity in the long run. Dartmouth should proactively promote campus discourse that stretches beyond just one day, instead of limping along from one reactionary response to the next.
While the tactics of the protestors were inappropriate, the issues they raised are very real. From the racist graffiti found in a dormitory in January to an alleged culture of sexual assault to the rabidly intolerant online responses to the protests, it is abundantly clear that Dartmouth is not always a safe place for every member of its community. A campus marked by division and mutual recrimination is a poor place for students to live and learn.
Dartmouth’s administration correctly realized that they needed to take action, but the decision to cancel classes sends the wrong message. Tolerance and celebration of diversity need to be reinforced and fostered throughout the year, but administrators have been silent on their plans for the future. The Dartmouth, the campus newspaper, has even speculated that the decision to cancel classes was an attempt to manage public relations more than it was a genuine effort to inspire reflection. Messages of togetherness cannot be neatly contained to a single day and then forgotten. If mutual respect cannot exist in the course of normal university operations, then these efforts are pointless. Dartmouth’s faculty, staff, and students need to be able to go about their daily lives and be accepting at the same time.
Students should seek to constructively engage with administrators and create ongoing programming that encourages an inclusive community. Shouting at admitted students, as the protestors did, fuels an atmosphere of mutual recrimination. It adds another difficulty to the already challenging task of addressing intolerance and hatred. Passionate but respectful student voices can help map out a way forward. The administration’s apparent reticence to create a comprehensive plan to promote diversity in light of these events needs to be met with a resolute effort to change policies, promote diversity, and encourage inclusion.
The recent events at Dartmouth should also inspire reflection at other universities—including Harvard. At this moment, the acrimony and division in Hanover may be far away from Cambridge, but the incidents at Dartmouth should remind Harvard of the value of community, inclusion, and student voice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a slow news week that pales in comparison to its marathon predecessors, yesterday’s big news came from the White House—namely, that President Obama had filled the position of Secretary of Commerce with affluent campaign donor (and Chicago scion) Penny Pritzker. The position had been vacant since the summer imbroglio in which Secretary John Bryson fell victim to inexplicable seizures while operating a vehicle. The major headlines from earlier in the week focused on Anthony Foxx, the Charlotte mayor tapped to head the Department of Transportation in the second Obama administration. Even The Onion joined the Cabinet action, publishing a fictitious tale of the newly appointed Secretary of the Interior’s rapid ascent to the White House, after her antecessors in the line of succession succumbed to a calamitous and inexplicable hot-air balloon accident.
Three and a half months into Obama’s second term, it is newsworthy that so many of these positions still need filling. While Senator John Kerry’s quick appointment led to an easy way out of the effervescing Susan Rice entanglement, both the White House and the Senate are finding that stalling replacements for executive posts is a great way to play politics well after the November election. There are, of course, some benefits to this—was any American business really stifled by the 10-month vacancy in the Department of Commerce, a bureau with responsibilities so nebulous that it deals with not only business programs, but also with oceans policy, weather forecasting, and tourism? But, as much as it pains to me to utter, we do have a government for a reason; our elected leaders should be able to make sure it functions in the fashion it was designed.
As The New York Times reported yesterday, the executive branch is suffering from a near unprecedented amount of vacancies, and this problem is not relegated solely to the inconsequential departments. While Kerry has held his perch at Foggy Bottom for months, nearly a quarter of the top positions at State remained unfilled. Perhaps Bolivia wouldn’t be kicking us out of the country if there were someone (anyone) around the office to tell Kerry that referring to Latin America as the U.S.’s “backyard” wasn’t a very good idea. The Department of Homeland Security is missing its two top cybersecurity officials—even as the White House argues for a more extensive approach to what is become the rather substantial threat of Chinese cyber attacks.
While one would have to respect the White House if it buckled down and admitted the inefficiencies within the federal government—as Rick Perry said, we need to eliminate the Departments of Commerce, Education, and Oops—funding agencies that lack the requisite personnel to perform their duties is a pointless operation. Obviously, the blame for this situation rests with both Obama and the advisers and consenters on Capitol Hill. Yet, while the White House has reproached the Republican Party for going to “extraordinary lengths…to obstruct the confirmation process,” it should not go unnoticed that Obama’s choices for a majority of these positions have remained unannounced, leading to little progress toward the return of an efficacious government (or at least a government as efficacious as such a naturally inefficient organ could possibly be).
Blaming the GOP has gotten the president pretty far, so it is understandable that he would want to throw some more animadversion their way. But in this case, it is not the job of the Senate to come up with its own solutions to these problems. Only Obama has the authority to “appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United State.” That these appointments require approval of the Senate is not sufficient reason for the president to shirk one of the legitimate powers the Constitution actually bestows upon the nation’s chief executive.
The president may be correct when he claims that the advent of a polarized Washington has created a hypercritical Congress. Still, that doesn’t mean he can just give up, muttering a feeble “I tried my hardest.” When you are the President of the United States, you have to do more than try—you must lead. That may mean that nominees that would have previously passed with flying colors, such as Department of Labor pick Tom Perez, will have to be preemptively borked (or, more accurately but less eloquently, “Miersed”). So be it. If the president wanted a better hand with which to work, maybe he should have been a better surrogate on his Democratic allies’ campaigns. At this point, Obama needs to assess the situation and put forth the best nominees he can come up with. And he has to do it with some celerity, at least nodding at the fable that these appointments have real, meaningful work to do.
Even with the surfeit of vacant posts, the government must go on. Unfortunately, that means making a broken system even more defective. There is only so much an acting deputy can do in lieu of his nonexistent capo, and as The New York Times reports, that authority stops short at making actual decisions. While Cicero assured us that “a nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious,” we now get to see if a nation can survive with nobody at the helm. If not, it might be time for Obama and the GOP to come to an accord and let a couple of fools and czars take the reins for the time being.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Viral content has essentially drowned within itself. It used to signify a particular image or video that represented a particular cultural marker. It was impossible to imitate. Part of the phenomenon’s allure came from the fact that no knew why exactly it was a phenomenon.
Then, over time, more content started to become viral. Sites like Reddit provided an easy medium to view all of the available viral content at any given time. Soon memes allowed for the personalization of viral content. And then came Buzzfeed, which turned viral content into an incredibly successful business model.
At this point, viral content changes every day. Each piece of content simply represents a wave in the ocean of the internet, crashing onto the shore one day before the tide slides it back into virtual oblivion.
Viral content is an endless list of funny gifs and cat videos, strange images and witty lists, but sometimes it can be much more significant.
A video surfaced yesterday that, by all the traditional metrics, has gone viral. People shared it on Facebook. It hit the front page of Reddit. And it played more than three million times in the first twenty-four hours. It also received coverage on the major news networks.
The video shows a plane crash at Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan. Like many of the similar videos that depict such destruction, it is mesmerizing, terrifying, and hauntingly surreal.
A plane ascends and then it tips on its side. And then it falls. Smoothly and silently and almost slowly, it falls. You think of a word to describe it and you want to say a word like “gliding” or “controlled” but both seem terribly wrong.
And then the ground absorbs it and it disappears. No sound, just an expanding fireball and a plume of smoke and seven people killed.
It almost reminds you of a movie (the Atlantic Wire compared it to sequences in The Dark Knight Rises and Flight) but it not quite. It may be the lack of sound or the fact it was shot on the dashboard cam. It may just be the knowledge that it is real.
But even then it does not quite seem real. We comprehend the visual destruction and the death and we tell ourselves that it is real. But it is still a video that went viral on the internet and it still does not seem completely real.
It is a continuing testament to the power of the internet in an age when the internet can start revolutions. But it should also be a caution about the viral spread of a human tragedy.
The fact is that the video, while a stark reminder about the dangers of flight, represents nothing more than a brief diversion for the majority of viewers. It is a spectacle, not a memorial. It gives people a virtual sense of reality’s dangers while they remain safe from the actual fear of those dangers.
Of course, the idea of human tragedy as a spectacle is nothing new, even for the internet. The proliferation of helmet cameras in Afghanistan and Iraq has created extensive footage of firefights on sites like Youtube. Quite a few have gone viral, with millions of views each. One channel has specifically documented firefights. In five years, it has had more than 132 million views.
Like all technological phenomena, the proliferation of these videos has both negative and positive consequences. In the future, it will provide an immense and unprecedented archival record for historians. It also allows civilians to appreciate the dangers and sacrifices of being a soldier in a completely new way.
But it also transforms war into another form of entertainment media, one regularly watched and consumed by viewers entranced by these video game-like sequences. And it also lends to a glamorization of war that denies its human elements for one of visual spectacle.
At the same time, the internet has dramatically accelerated the proliferation of these videos to a mass audience. The fact that these videos can go viral means that the people can die one day and their deaths can go viral on the internet, seen by millions, by the time their families find out.
This gets at the true problem of tragic videos in the land of viral content. As observers, the millions who have seen the video will never mourn for those who died except in the most abstract sense. They will not comprehend the grief that those families are experiencing while watching the very document and symbol of that grief.
And tomorrow will come and another video will emerge and the pain of their loss will simply slide out to sea like all of the other lost content on the internet.

What struck me the most about my first robbery was its normality. It occurred on a sunny afternoon, in a botanical garden through which citizens passed regularly. One of the thieves carried a wooden log, the other a knife. They were silent. They didn’t harm us. They took our things and left.
It was the second day of our trip from Mérida, in Venezuela’s western mountains, to Angel Falls, in its eastern jungle, and we had arrived in Ciudad Bolívar with some extra time before our plane departed for a national park. After it happened, all three of us sat stunned for a while near the coconut trees and counted our losses: two cameras, our phones, our money. Then my friend Kelsey,gasped—inside her backpack, which they had taken, had been her passport.
We considered going to the police station later that day, but our tour guide discouraged us: It would soon close and would provide little help. Our best option would be to continue with the trip to Angel Falls, which we had already paid for, and then head to the US Embassy in Caracas.
There was no internet reception at Angel Falls: I returned to Ciudad Bolívar to several frantic emails from my parents. “We keep calling your phone and some strange Venezuelan answers! What’s going on?” As I explained my situation to them, I got an idea. If this robber would answer the phone when my parents called, might he return the passport?
I borrowed my friend Will’s phone and sent a text message: “Hello. You robbed me on Saturday. I haven’t told anyone, and don’t plan to. But there’s one passport you have that you don’t need; if you can just drop it off somewhere, wherever you want, I would be very grateful.” I added, “May God bless you.”
Five hours later, as we sat on our bus, I received a response. “Look,” he said. “I’m going to give you the passport. Don’t worry. It’s late, and I need to take care of my sick daughter, but I’m going to call you at 10 a.m. tomorrow and we’ll figure this out. I’m in Caracas.”
***
It was my third time in the country’s capital, and the election campaign to replace late president Hugo Chávez had switched into full gear. Graffiti along street walls depicted the late president with his selected heir, Nicolás Maduro. In the streets of the more secure, wealthier neighborhoods where we stayed, graffiti celebrated the opposition candidate Henrique Capriles, the governor of Miranda state who had lost to Chávez in elections held last October.
We went directly to an institute run by an acquaintance of mine and learned that the Embassy would be closed for the remainder of the week due to Easter. We counted our money: a total of 500 bolívares—about $85 at the official exchange rate—and $40 American dollars, which could be exchanged for about 880 bolívares on the black market. Caracas has one of the world’s highest costs of living; we figured we could make it through one, maybe two days. Then my acquaintance offered us a deal: With a delegation arriving next weekend for the presidential elections, there was a good deal of housework to complete. If we spent our days helping, we could stay for free with room and board.
As we got to work painting, around 11 a.m., our robber sent a text message. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m too busy to call. My daughter is very sick, and I can’t think about anything else. I’ll get you the passport tomorrow.” A few hours later, he did call: “You’re the ones from the botanical garden, right?” Though he had gone from Caracas to be with his daughter, he told us, he had left the passport with his sister. He hung up, and sent a text message with her phone number. When I called, a stern woman asked for half an hour to check for the passport. We never heard from her again.
***
The Embassy approved Kelsey’s emergency passport request, but they refused to accept payment via credit card. We paid in cash: 875 bolívares in processing fees; 100 for shipping. With the 25 bolívares left over, we returned in public transportation to the institute, where we had left another 300.
It was less than half the necessary money to buy standard tickets back to Mérida, and now our only option would be on a bus run by SITSSA, a transportation company created by the Chávez government. It was affordable, its fares much lower than those of private companies, but not necessarily reliable: Only one bus to Mérida left per day, and without enough passengers, it simply wouldn’t run.
When we arrived at the bus terminal, the ticket vendor told me that workers at the information desk might be able to help. Indeed, they reacted with great sympathy. Those robbers, they assured us, did not reflect the generosity of the citizens of Venezuela; they themselves would do all they could to help. One woman told me that the private bus companies offered special tickets to those with government benefits, which one of her friends had. “Wait for my friend to come,” she told me, “and we’ll get the tickets.”
As the afternoon wore on, and the woman disappeared, I realized that I’d better return to the institute. I left the terminal, thinking again of the robbery and how fortunate it was that I had packed a wallet back in January to use in the event that I was robbed, including a college ID, old gift cards, and some Venezuelan and American money to make it look real. And then I stopped: There was money in that wallet! If it contained at least 400 bolívares, we would have enough to travel without help. I called Kelsey back at the institute, and directed her to the backpack in my room. In the wallet, she counted 400 bolívares.
I raced back to the ticket vendors to tell them to hold three tickets, but they informed me that I had to pay directly. Ticket sales ended in two hours, at 5 p.m. The institute was an hour away, which made it tight, but we successfully sprinted back to the bus terminal, money and luggage in hand, by 4:45 p.m.
***
As we sat in the waiting area to board our bus, leaving at 5:30 p.m., we congratulated ourselves at having made it through the ordeal after all. With a sense of relief, we noticed members of the National Guard loading their bags onto our bus. “Now we’re safe,” Kelsey whispered.
A National Guardsman checked our tickets and passports. When it came to Kelsey, we explained that her passport had been stolen. We showed our papers from the Embassy, and he shook his head: “Where’s the police report? If you don’t have the police report, you can’t travel.” The bus employee standing next to him nodded. Our situation seemed desperate. I wasn’t even sure if we had enough money to get back to the institute.
After the last passenger boarded, the officer pulled me aside. “Let’s talk,” he said. I explained that we had been told by our Venezuelan tour guide to simply go to the Embassy without a police report. He gave me a blank stare. I remembered the American dollars in my wallet.
“What if we pay a fine?” I asked. He nodded. I grabbed every bill I had and placed them on the ground in front of the National Guardsman. He counted. “You can pass,” he finally said with a faint smile.
The bus employee was directing passengers to their seats when we got on, and as I passed her she turned toward me. “Why in the world did you do that?” she said. “You really didn’t need to bribe him with that much money.”
I sensed that she expected to placate me, a foreigner robbed by a member of the National Guard, but we were our way home at last and all I could do was laugh.

Models gyrate on stage, bodies moving in complicated circles. The sexual energy is as palpable as the throbbing bass of the hip-hop soundtrack or the audience members’ collective cloud of perfume. The models, miming a James Bond storyline, bounce down the runway. Their movements are sharp, combative. By the second act, everyone in the VIP section presses against the stage in a mass of sequins and silky hair, dancing even though they’ve been told not to. Sitting in the audience of Eleganza feels like drinking vodka-spiked, carbonated red bull.
The largest, oldest, and perhaps most renowned fashion show on Harvard’s campus, Eleganza has long been known for its glamorous ethos. Yet Eleganza’s mission, according to its website, is “focused on diversity and charity, celebrating different cultures, backgrounds, and forms of expression.” It donates its proceeds to Teen Empowerment, a Boston-based program seeking to empower youths to address social issues in their communities.
Founded in 1994 under the umbrella organization Harvard Black C.A.S.T., a student theater group dedicated to the performing arts of the black diaspora, Eleganza is a high-budget and highly-organized production. Its roots in a cultural and arts organization are still apparent, however, in the ethnic diversity of its models and highly theatrical style of its performance—an aesthetic which has gained the show both criticism and accolades over the years.
“It’s a spectacle,” says Thomas M. Dai ’14, who worked as a fashion director for Eleganza his freshman year, and has since been heavily involved in the Harvard fashion scene. “Confident, definitely sexy, definitely in a way provocative—that sort of theatrical element to it,” he says.
In past years, this element of provocation has sometimes led to controversy, largely surrounding the show’s portrayals of racialized and sexualized beauty. As early as 1998, reported The Crimson, some students were criticizing the overt sexuality of the performance, alleging that Eleganza’s sexy aesthetic objectified female models. Back in 2004, an advisor for the Association of Black Harvard Women sent an open letter over an email list wherein she criticized the production for what she believed to be its stereotypical portrayal of African Americans. In 2009, a Crimson editorial writer lodged another complaint: Eleganza had not fulfilled its professed charity obligation. Last year, the alleged photoshopping of models’ bodies in posters sparked discussion over what some saw as the disparity between the show’s mission and its practices in terms of the promotion of diverse beauty standards. This year, the show’s official Facebook features a notice under one of its promotional albums alluding to that controversy. The disclaimer reads, “Note: Eleganza does NOT photoshop the bodies of its models. They’re naturally this beautiful.”
But for students like Dai, it’s not the history of controversy or even the clothing that truly marks Eleganza, but its fast-paced glitz. “It’s a night where people can dress up, people can have fun,” he says. “It does have this sort of Social Network-y feeling. ‘Oh, we’re going to go out and see these beautiful people on the runway.’” Yet, says Dai, the show goes far beyond Harvard prep.
For Macarena M. Arias ’14, who modelled in Eleganza for the first time this year, working on the show helped break some of these stereotypes. “I think there is this expectation, the stereotype that final clubs have: white, rich, whatever. But I definitely see diversity when it comes to that, in terms of ethnicity,” Arias says. Arias, who lives in the Dudley Co-op and modelled in menswear, says that she tried out on a whim. When Arias modeled, she swaggered across the stage along with the other menswear models, posed and added a pelvic-thrust at the end.
One side of Arias’s hair is shorn to her scalp, the other wavy to her chin. She indicates her own look as proof of the diversity of models in the show. “I’m not a model. I never try to wear preppy,” says Arias. “And I’m in it.”
While it is a fashion show, Eleganza’s main draw is not necessarily the clothes. “Anyone can tell going to the show that the clothes are not the stars,” says Meisha B. Brooks ’14, a professional model who has worked on the production end of Eleganza in the past and who is familiar with Harvard’s fashion scene. “What makes Eleganza so attractive is that it is more for everyone, everyone can enjoy it and be entertained by it.”
As models strut to the thrum of the music and the roar of the crowd, it’s easy to see why, for students like Dai, Eleganza is, at heart, a fantasy. It’s “escapist,” he says. “With these fashion shows, there’s the impulse to give a different world."

When Alex C. Boota ’15 learned that his freshman year roommate, Dario Guerrero-Meneses ’15 was an undocumented immigrant, he was shocked. “It just blew my mind that there were undocumented people at Harvard,” says Boota. He adds quickly, “Coming from South Carolina, I’m probably a little sheltered.”
Today, a year and a half after Boota and Guerrero-Meneses ended up in the same dorm room, the two have just finished editing the final, 40-minute cut of the documentary film they co-directed, shot, and edited, “A Dream Deferred.” The film follows three undocumented Harvard students around campus and to their hometowns.
One scene features a student checking the status of his immigration case from his standard-issue desk in Wigglesworth, his hand hovering over an American flag mouse pad. In another student’s dorm, across campus, the camera sweeps from the student’s face to pictures of Led Zeppelin and Emma Watson, poster-gummed to the walls. A junior walks around the southern California city where she grew up, pointing out landmarks of her childhood.
Boota became interested in making the documentary, he says, because of his roommate. He explains that Guerrero-Meneses was unable to accept an offer of a research assistantship because his immigration status prevented him from working, and the law prevented the University from letting him work for free. “He was shut out of a lot of the opportunities that other students just take for granted,” Boota says.
“When you first come here, you really feel a sense of belonging, because for the first time, you were accepted. Harvard knew that I was undocumented,” says Enrique Ramírez ’16, an undocumented student who was featured in “A Dream Deferred.” Ramírez, a freshman, serves as co-chair of the IOP’s Immigration Policy Group and as the Legislative Director of Act on a Dream at Harvard College, a student-run organization that advocates for immigrant rights.
“You meet people [at Harvard] that come from all sorts of issues,” says Ramírez. “I’m undocumented, and that’s kind of been an obstacle, but other people have more obstacles, or obstacles that I hear about and think, ‘Okay, I’d rather be undocumented. It’s not so bad.’”
Deferring Action
Ramírez’s testimony signals a significant change in the Harvard community’s attitude towards issues of immigration. Melissa V. Pérez ’13, who formerly served as Act on a Dream’s co-director, says that graduates of the Class of 2009 found it difficult to openly talk about their status as undocumented students. They told her of instances when they would be overwhelmed by what they felt was an ongoing crisis: the uncertainty that loomed around their futures. At times, they said, they would reach out to proctors and tutors only to be blatantly ignored or pushed away because their undocumented status turned them into a potential liability.
Pérez believes that Act on a Dream has gradually allowed for some of those muted conversations to take place on campus. When the organization started, it did not have members that self-identified as undocumented students.
“Many of us were affected by this issue personally, but none of us were necessarily undocumented,” Pérez says. “Slowly, the organization has grown as a presence on campus and these students know they have a source of support.”
Even those who have not joined Act on a Dream seem to find a home at Harvard. One undocumented student, Gary Castellanos ’16, mentions, “At Harvard, as an undocumented student, I really don’t have any issues, you know. It feels completely normal.”
Yet navigating Harvard as an undocumented student certainly comes with its difficulties. Castellanos admits that he is unable to obtain jobs or internships because he has been waiting to hear back on his deferred action status for more than seven months. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive order passed by the Obama administration last year, “protects undocumented students from deportation,” according to Act on a Dream’s website. Under DACA, undocumented students can also apply for two-year work permits.
“I can’t emphasize this enough,” Ramírez says, “DACA has completely changed everything.”
Yet DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for undocumented young people, and does not represent the comprehensive immigration reform envisioned in the DREAM Act.
“Even with DACA, there’s still issues with students ‘coming out’—you have to admit you’re undocumented,” Ramírez adds. “There’s still people who are really uncomfortable with doing that. There are no specific safe spaces—and where would a student like that go?”
Searching for Resources
Despite Harvard’s admittance of several undocumented students every year, the University has yet to specifically designate an administrator or body to provide resources for this community. Student initiatives like Act on a Dream then end up serving as intermediaries between undocumented students and the administration.
Ramírez maintains that such an arrangement is simply not enough to meet all undocumented students’ needs.
“The way that [undocumented students] get help from Act on a Dream is that they admit they’re undocumented to the University,” Ramírez says. “The University itself doesn’t have an accurate count of how many undocumented students are here. There’s nothing that the University does directly.”
Guerrero-Meneses says that he believes the University should play a more active role in providing resources to undocumented students.
“I feel as if the school has a certain responsibility to do that, because it provides resources for students from so many legal and socioeconomic situations,” says Guerrero-Meneses. “It provides the guidance networks for them. It would only make sense for the school to do the same for this other group of students. It just doesn’t seem right.”
Guerrero-Meneses says two law professors he interviewed for “A Dream Deferred” later asked him to cut the footage. He speculates that the professors were concerned that the University would face repercussions for its acceptance of undocumented students.
“That sort of let me see what Harvard’s attitude really was,” says Guerrero-Meneses. “It’s friendly, but at the same time, it’s trying to hide that fact that there are students like this at Harvard.”
Flight, Interrupted
Eric Balderas ’14, another undocumented Harvard student, has a more positive assessment of the University’s approach. “It’s really just a matter of putting yourself out there to a few, key individuals, persons that you trust,” says Balderas. “I think it’s a tricky situation for the administration, but they’re there, and I feel like they offer a lot of support.”
The summer after his freshman year at Harvard, in June of 2010, Balderas was flying from his home in Texas back to Cambridge to do research at MIT when he was detained at the airport. He was let go, he says, after about eight hours, and allowed to travel on to Boston. But his case remained pending. He faced deportation to Mexico, a country he had left at the age of four.
When he landed in Boston, Balderas launched a campaign with friends involved in migrant activism in the area. When the case began to receive media attention, Balderas said, Harvard came to him and offered to help.
Students from Act on a Dream contacted the Immigration and Refugee Clinic at the Harvard Law School and put Balderas in contact with its director, Professor Deborah Anker. Professor Anker helped Balderas receive prosecutorial discretion, which de-prioritized him for deportation.
That fall, Univeristy President Drew G. Faust accompanied Balderas to Washington D.C. to meet with Senator Richard Durbin (D) of Illinois, one of the original proponents of the DREAM Act, to draw further attention to the case.
“When I was threatened with deportation, it resolved itself pretty quickly,” says Balderas. “I’ve felt very protected after that.”
Forging a Future 
On April 17, a bipartisan group of eight senators, known as the “gang of eight,” presented an immigration bill meant to overhaul what many see as the nation’s broken immigration system. While critics claim the new bill leaves much to be desired, activists at Harvard feel the bill presents yet another opportunity for the University and its students to increase awareness about immigration on campus.
“There’s been a growing, more enthusiastic movement nationally that has made the campus a lot more receptive to issues of immigration,” says Pérez, recalling when legislators reintroduced the DREAM Act in 2009.
“When the DREAM Act came up to a vote, we thought the bill wouldn’t fly,” Pérez says, “But we worked with Harvard to lobby with senators anyway.”
Harvard itself has played a role in the wider immigration debate: in 2009, Faust officially endorsed the DREAM Act. María Romero, co-director of the IOP’s Immigration Policy Group, says that Faust’s support marked a huge change not only in the culture of the College, but in the national dialogue surrounding immigration.
“That was when the DREAM Act was really a hot button issue, so there was a lot of pressure from the outside to make a statement about it,” Romero says. “It was one that there were few precedents for, so it definitely was one that required a lot of proactive movement on her part and the part of the administration.”
For undocumented students, even small steps toward more comprehensive reform can have a big impact. Before DACA, Ramírez says, he had no idea what life after college would bring. While his peers would be vying for scholarships, spots in graduate schools, and prestigious jobs, he feared he would have no choice but to engage in manual labor because of his undocumented status.
“It was something I was constantly thinking about, ‘what if,’” he says. “Here, it’s a totally different world. I feel like I can do a lot of things, especially being around very accomplished people. I feel like it’s possible.”

Compline: root, Latin: complentorium; the completion of a working day. The chapel opens its mouth to believers, flinging open its cavernous sanctuary to usher in the night and its children for worship. And the children come: faces glowing and slanted down, boots knocking on the wooden floor with each step.
"All having assembled in one place, let them say Compline," Saint Benedict decreed in the sixth century, his white beard frothy around his neck. And then Compline became ritual: a time of contemplation and meditation before sleep. It continued through the years. Through the invention of playing cards, the compass, eyeglasses, and moveable type, pious monks would come together at night, all over the world, for reflective observation before “the great silence” of rest. Leaving Compline, they would not speak until Lauds, the early morning worship service.
Compline is a twilight ritual, the final service in the Christian canonical hours. Though the ritual is ancient, Harvard’s Compline worshippers are young, students fleshy and wide-eyed; even the minister has an acne-scarred chin and bouncy bobbed hair.
“The Lord Almighty grant us a quiet night and a perfect end,” she reads. Then the choir sings across the room’s hush. Their mouths are round as they release pure, folding, floating song up into the night, letting it reverberate and circulate like convection currents below the high ceiling.
Compline service is for singing and psalms, one short reading, a response. Twelve University Choir members face each other in opposing pews as they sing, tall candles elucidating the spiny notes of their score. The candles lean into the singers so that the flames flutter with each gasp of breath. My own candle, teetering in my closed fist, wears a cardboard tutu to protect my fingers from droplets of wax. Its tiny speck of light illuminates the church’s darkness: the mahogany paneling, the wide pulpit, the white plaster and rectangle molding of the ceiling.
Appleton Chapel, tucked in the back of Memorial Church, was constructed in 1932. Even though Harvard was founded before Newton derived his laws of motion, before French commoners stormed the Bastille, its iconic church steeple is younger than my grandfather. We worshippers are children playing at games for grown ups, questioning the spirit, mortality, and cosmic time—or, at least, trying to. “Love is strong as death,” the choir sings. “Many waters cannot quench love; neither can the floods drown it.”
I hold the narrow candle I was given when I entered the chapel and watch a dab of plasma dance on its comma-shaped wick. As it grooves and jumps, I wonder: What makes a flame flicker, even when the universe is still? Plasma has a particular energy, an inspired one. Its movement must come from somewhere.
“Lord, please give them the grace to know what is worth knowing, give them wisdom to see beneath the surface of things,” the minister whistles, blinking down on our bowed heads. Her voice is fresh and vulnerable. Beside the pulpit, white lilies branch from their necks, opening their petals in cone-shaped attention.
She reads the names of friends of Harvard who have died in the past week: a professor, an alumna. I imagine the names that have fallen from lips here through the decades, the ones that the curve of lips will utter in future months and years and years.
Lips swirl in calculated, beautiful motion on the faces of the choir singers, on my own face as I mouth along to the hymn “Abide with Me, Fast Falls the Eventide.”
The Lord be with you, and with thy spirit. "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest in your souls."

As a student in Adams House, Becky A. Cooper ’10 hand-printed blank maps of Manhattan at Bow and Arrow Press. In the summer of 2009, Cooper walked down Broadway handing them out to strangers and asking them to “map their memories” and mail the finished product back to her. The resulting project, labeled a “PostSecret-style tribute to Manhattan,” features maps filled in by post-docs, senior citizens, and a handful of celebrity New Yorkers, among many others. A former Crimson Arts editor, Cooper compiled these maps into her first book “Mapping Manhattan: A Love (And Sometimes Hate) Story in Maps by 75 New Yorkers,”which was published this April. She is currently expanding the project to Harvard Square.
Fifteen Minutes: How did you come up with the idea for the project?
Becky Cooper: I was accidentally hired the summer after my freshman year to make a map of all the public art in Manhattan. Because I had basically no graphic design experience and definitely no cartography experience, I was hyper-aware of the decisions I was making and of questions like whether a carousel is art, or whether the art in public schools or hospitals is public. [My boss’s]  goal was to create a thorough map of Manhattan. She wanted it to have 1,500 pieces of artwork and cross-references to the artwork’s provenance on the back, along with a thumbnail image of each. But no matter how much we were printing on this map, it was never going to be thorough. It was necessarily going to be a subjective, filtered view of Manhattan and of public art in general.That realization came in concert with seeing these napkins pile up next to my desk of where I was heading on a given night. It was before I had a smartphone, so I would draw myself these little maps. I realized that those maps, in series, told an interesting story about my life that summer. They told an interesting story of the city. In some ways, it was a more honest story than the one I was building [for my boss] because it was celebrating the subjectivity of the mapmaker. Those two realizations, coupled with my having read Italo Calvino’s “Invisible Cities” the year before, grew into this: I wanted to give really small, limited maps to as many New Yorkers as possible and have them map their New Yorks. And then, in series, have a New York emerge from there.
FM: How do you see the relationship between maps and memory differing between Cambridge and New York?
BC: In Cambridge, you have really different populations. You have the students whose relationship to the area is acute but ephemeral, but you also have the Cambridge personalities who are so much of what this city is. [For students] you get a lot of introspection, and you get it focused in a really small area. [For example,] memory is ascribed to particular rooms in buildings.The way that I went about doing Cambridge differently was that I had a lot of anonymous students do it, but I also reached out specifically to business owners. Because I think more than in New York, their businesses, or their personalities, or their names are part of what makes Cambridge what it is. And having them identified added a layer of understanding to Harvard Square. Like the shoe repair guy: What is his Cambridge? Or the guy in the comic store, what’s his? Or the almost- banned bookseller?
FM: In your book, you included your own map of Manhattan. In Harvard Square, where would you begin?
BC: I think my map would necessarily be a love story. I haven’t drawn it yet, but what’s interesting about these maps is that what you initially think you’re going to draw is not what you end up drawing. I think I would draw Bow Street and Arrow Street as the cupid bow that they form, and then put in particular spots where my flashes of memory are really vivid, and then the walks in between them. Obviously the Bow and Arrow Press is where I printed the maps, and I lived in Adams House. But also, I love that there’s this romance built into the geography of the area, and I think that thematically plays well with the spirit of the project.

When Virginia Tech senior Seung-Hui Cho threatened self-harm in his undergraduate residence hall in winter 2005, the police took him to the hospital for an overnight stay. Cho was released the next morning, the last day of the fall semester, and attended a follow-up appointment at the campus counseling center before heading home for winter break. He never returned to counseling.
Eighteen months later, Cho killed 32 people and wounded 17 more before killing himself. The massacre at Virginia Tech in 2007 was the deadliest shooting incident by a single gunman in United States history.
“Everyone at the university was devastated,” remembers Christopher Flynn, the Director of Virginia Tech’s Cook Counseling Center. “When [Cho] came in, the counseling center was relatively understaffed. There were nine counselors on the staff; there was one psychiatrist, and maybe a part-time nurse practitioner, but they were clearly under-resourced for the size of the university.”
It took a tragedy that reverberated across the nation to expedite the improvement of mental health resources at Virginia Tech. Grants from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice helped the university expand its counseling programs—the administration quickly added counselors, case managers, and a wide array of resources for students. “Over the past six years, we’ve effectively doubled the attendance of the counseling center,” says Flynn. “It’s hard to say that anything good or positive came out of the tragedy, except that we have much better resources in place for the students now.”
Virginia Tech is not the only university to have responded to its worst tragedies by proposing and implementing an overhaul of its mental health services. In 2003-2004, six students at NYU jumped to their deaths. Since then, the school has created a 24/7 hotline, a walk-in clinic, and a two-question mental health screening survey to be administered before any general health appointment, among other initiatives. Closer to home, MIT also expanded its mental health resources in response to a spiked suicide rate in the 1990s.
In recent years, Harvard has also had reason to reevaluate its mental health policies. Two undergraduate students have committed suicide in the past year. In 2011, an anonymous Crimson article entitled “I Am Fine,” written by a student with suicidal thoughts, sparked a debate on the stigma behind mental health as well as on mental health services offered by Harvard. Another anonymous article published in February, by a student suffering from schizophrenia reinvigorated the conversation. From mental health rallies and national coverage of Harvard’s services to student-initiated Tumblr and video projects amid campus-wide outrage, Harvard students seem to have reached a critical mass in wanting to talk about mental health support.
Colleges across the country are dealing with some of the same mental health issues that have prompted heated debate on Harvard’s campus. Yet many heads of mental health programs note that a deeper engagement with these issues is often missing from these kinds of discussions. “It’s often really easy for students to criticize a counseling service,” says Greg Eells, the Director of Counseling and Psychological Services at Cornell. “It’s harder to go back and say, ‘What kind of service do we want? What is the level of care we want to provide to students?’”
Responding effectively to such questions necessitates an in-depth, comparative approach. Programs and policies implemented at peer schools, in addition to input from mental health experts across the nation, can shed light on the status of Harvard’s own mental health practices. Indeed, while Harvard can certainly improve its services—particularly regarding wait times—the main obstacles to overcome are, rather, misinformation and lack of information concerning existing resources, along with ignorance regarding the rationale behind Harvard’s mental health treatment philosophy. Clarifying these matters is the first step to understanding where Harvard currently stands, and how it can continue to do better.
 A University Issue?
Some question whether institutions of higher education should be responsible for providing mental health resources and care to students, given that their primary purpose is education. However, many others insist that campus-supported mental health programs are essential for maintaining student well-being.
Eells of Cornell argues that strong mental health underlies the mission of higher education—according to him, the growth and development of the mind. “One of our guiding principles is to focus on the foundational nature of the health of the mind,” says Eells. “Our institution is really dedicated to expanding the life of the mind, growth of the mind, growth of the intellect, and realizing that for that to happen, the foundation, the healthy mind, has to be there first.”
Promoting a “healthy mind” becomes increasingly challenging and relevant for the college age population. The percentage of 18-24 year olds who seriously considered committing suicide anytime in the past year varies from 7 percent to 11.4 percent, depending on the study—rates significantly higher than those listed for the over-25 age bracket.
According to national surveys, the pressures of college, both academic and social, place additional strains on an already vulnerable population. A poll by the American College Health Association reveals that almost half of college students have reported feeling “hopeless” anytime in the past 12 months. About a third reported feeling that they were “so depressed it was difficult to function.” Mental health issues are not limited to depression: The decade between ages 15 and 25 is the most common period for the onset of schizophrenia, while late adolescence and early adulthood are also peak years for the onset of bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa.
Victor Schwartz, the medical director of the Jed Foundation, claims that if colleges want to see higher percentages of students reach graduation, adequate mental health support is necessary. “The U.S. has many students who start college but we’re pretty dismal at making sure they finish,” he says. “The biggest problem [they face in finishing] is probably financial—but the next largest challenge is probably social, emotional, psychological factors.”
Laurie Martinelli, Executive Director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Massachusetts believes there should be parity between the physical and mental health services that colleges offer. Martinelli considers it unjust that many schools require a higher co-pay for mental health issues than they do for physical health concerns.
“If [the college] pays 100 percent of hospital coverage for someone with diabetes it should pay for 100 percent of hospital coverage with someone with bipolar,” she explains. “If it pays for unlimited physical therapy appointments for someone with a broken arm, it should pay for unlimited appointments with one therapist.”
For the most part, the mental health offerings at Harvard University Health Services seem to match its physical health offerings. Student Mental Health Services at Harvard does not require a co-pay for internal treatment, and if patients request outside treatment they must contribute $35 per appointment, with Harvard subsidizing the additional cost. Harvard students are not restricted to a certain number of counseling appointments as students at Brown and other colleges are, but the frequency of their appointments is at the discretion of Harvard clinicians. If a student wants to have psychotherapy appointments every week, for example, but a clinician thinks that monthly appointments will suffice for treatment, the student will have to find an outside doctor and pay him or her out of pocket.
Achievable Goals
Though they are limited in what they can achieve, experts say that college counseling and psychological services groups are uniquely qualified to assist students in several concrete ways. Beyond providing therapy, college counseling centers can work with administrations to increase the physical safety of campus, as well as to educate, counteract stigma, and minimize accessibility barriers.
Campuses should manage their built environments, according to these professionals, so as to minimize opportunities for self-harm. This can involve securing dangerous bridges and windows, and keeping poisonous lab chemicals under lock and key. For example, features like gorges at Cornell or NYU’s high-rise library pose a safety concern within a mental health framework. Such features can often be modified: After a Harvard student attempted to commit suicide by jumping from Leverett Towers in the 1940s, Harvard sealed shut certain large windows in the building and instead designed a smaller, less-hazardous window that could be cranked open for air.
Counseling and mental health centers can also work to increase accessibility for their own mental health resources by ensuring that their centers have multiple points of entry, from drop-in offices to hotlines to confidential email addresses. Such mental health support should be fully integrated into the campus structure so that students can be quickly and seamlessly directed to the resources they need, no matter where they begin asking. At Harvard, the Bureau of Study Counsel, the Wellness Center, Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response are all trained to identify signs of mental illness and help collaborate with Student Mental Health Services to direct students to appropriate resources.
Another part of improving mental health accessibility is financial: making care affordable for students and ensuring that counseling centers themselves are receiving appropriate funding. Harvard offers both mandatory health insurance coverage and an optional Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan, though the majority of students at the College do not take advantage of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield option. Those who opt-out, then, may not be aware that this choice restricts their access to mental health care. The optional plan includes additional mental health coverage: visits to therapists outside the UHS system, inpatient admission to a general or psychiatric hospital, and access to emergency medical funding on a case-by-case basis.
A major complaint posed by many Harvard students, including those who attended a mental health rally in February, is that wait times for SMHS appointments are unreasonably long. According to the Student Mental Health Service Patient Satisfaction Survey of 2013, 41.2 percent of students surveyed said they had to wait between 1 and 2 weeks between calling the clinic and having an appointment with a clinician, while 16.4 percent said they had to wait between 2 and 3 weeks for care and 5 percent listed waiting over 3 weeks for an appointment. 42 percent of students responded that clinician availability was the main barrier they encountered to scheduling an appointment and therefore seeking help.
Paul J. Barreira, Director of Harvard University Health Services, and Katherine A. Lapierre, Chief of Student Mental Health Services, say they consider seeing 75 percent of students within two weeks of their calling the clinic to be an adequate standard of care. However, other schools make their services immediately accessible to students. Virginia Tech, for example, aims to give every student who calls the counseling center an appointment with a counselor within 48 hours.
Virginia Tech achieves a two-day wait objective even though its counselor to student ratio is 1:1500— right on the national accreditation rate. Harvard’s wait times are longer despite its much more accommodating counselor to student ratio of 1:750. Flynn of Virginia Tech offers one hypothesis for Harvard’s longer wait times. “I think the health centers at the smaller schools are used by a greater percentage of the population,” Flynn says. “A smaller school is more likely to be private, and more likely that a greater percentage of the student body will be trying to get services.”
Barreira and Lapierre say they recognize that sometimes Harvard students want more appointments than SMHS counselors can offer them, but they do not consider wait times to be among the most pressing problems that the clinic faces. “Most of the time most students feel like what’s being offered meets the needs,” says Barreira.
“We try very hard to not make people into chronic patients,” says Lapierre. “We want people to come in and get well and get back to life.” Lapierre says that some people who started in long-term weekly psychotherapy before college are used to that regularity of care. “But then you’ve got to ask: are they improving? Are they actually getting better?” says Lapierre. “There can be a patient request which may not be what anyone would consider best practice.”
Students frequently complain about the wait times and counselor availability at SMHS, but when asked what SMHS would do with unlimited funding and resources, Lapierre says she would want the clinic to put more focus on prevention work. “I would not suggest that we would ever want to do weekly ongoing therapy. There’s a very very small percentage of people for whom that’s really indicated,” she says. Lapierre’s claim is backed by several recent studies, including a 2008 article published in the Chronicle of Higher Education, which confirm that simply adding more therapists is not always the best way to ensure that students are getting the mental health resources they need.
Indeed, experts note, the number of therapists on call does little to address an underlying obstacle for those considering seeking help: the stigma surrounding mental health care. Drew Walther is the National Chapter Director of Active Minds, a mental health advocacy group with chapters on college campuses nationwide. Walther emphasises that eliminating stigma is key to increasing the accessibility of counseling services.“If stigma is preventing someone from seeking services,” says Walther, “then if there are any other barriers—if there are fees, for example—it’s so easy to put off mental health concerns.”
Campus officials can minimize stigma, he says, by educating all students about mental health and modeling how discussions on the topic can be productive and respectful. Harvard’s SMHS starts this process early by hosting mandatory mental health resource orientation sessions during Opening Days for undergraduates, and during orientation for graduate school students. Harvard SMHS also trains proctors and tutors to detect mental health issues. Nevertheless, as a Crimson series published last fall noted, stigma surrounding mental health continues to plague Harvard’s campus, along with many others.
Mental Health as Public Health
The implementation of significant changes to mental health policy requires a shift in attitudes concerning mental health. For many this implies treating mental health as a broader issue of public health.
According to a mental health action planning publication put out by the Jed Foundation, a national organization working to reduce emotional distress and prevent suicide among college students, a public health approach involves expanding from simply providing treatment services to working to prevent mental health issues from surfacing—ultimately promoting the mental health of all students on campus. This two-pronged approach—prevention and treatment—should operate on a continuum that encompasses the enhancement of students’ general health, early recognition and intervention, treatment, maintenance, and “postvention,” or follow up.
Walther of Active Minds points to recent studies demonstrating that students’ relationships with their peers are crucial to preventing mental health crises. “When someone is depressed,” Walther adds, “two-thirds of those people go to a friend before they go to a professional, a parent.” It is students, then, who need to know how to respond. “The friend needs to be able to talk about those issues, and know what to do, and know how to help,” Walther explains.
Survey results demonstrate that Harvard students who have friends they can confide in tend to have better mental health overall. Barreira says that an anonymous survey administered to Harvard freshmen at the beginning of school asks students to list how many people they have in their lives with whom they can share their most private thoughts, fears, desires, and ambitions. The average response is between 5 and 7, but every year some students say they have no one they can share with. Further analysis of the results confirmed that students who have nobody to talk to account for more than half of those who have depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts.
“If you have no one in your life, you have the highest risk of suicidal thoughts,” says Barreira of Harvard. “If you have even just one person in your life the risk goes down.” Barreira goes on to explain that response data from this one survey question really helps raise awareness of who is at risk for mental health concerns and how these people can be helped.
“We need to help people to not keep things to themselves,” Barreira asserts, since those who can share their thoughts with others generally have better mental health according to the survey. Harvard’s numerous peer response groups—Room 13, Response, ECHO, and Contact—and its peer education groups like DAPA, Student Mental Health Liaisons, Consent, Assault Awareness & Relationship Education, and Harvard Men Against Rape all provide safe spaces where Harvard students can confide in their peers in hopes that students will feel empowered to tell somebody about what’s troubling them.
Barreira believes that the common focus on health promotion, education, and early identification that each of the five Harvard behavior health services departments share epitomizes a public health approach to mental health. He lists the depression screenings, which occur in all of the house dining halls and Annenberg each fall, as another example of how Harvard SMHS is trying to prioritize a public health-type strategy.
“You’re raising people’s awareness about what depression anxiety looks like, you’re asking people to look out for themselves and everyone else, you’re telling them where the resources are, and you’re doing early identification, or identification of people who haven’t been treated yet,” he says of the depression screenings. “That’s all public health kinds of work.”
Barreira spotlights the anonymous survey released to all new Harvard freshmen as a public health approach to mental health because of how much it helps with awareness and early identification. The survey asks students about their medical history, particularly as it pertains to mental health, so that the University can determine the types of clinical conditions that people struggle with right from the start college.
Given the large percentage of students who enter Harvard with existing mental health conditions, Lapierre asks, “How do we help [these students] recognize that and come in?” The depression screening is one way, she and Barreira argue. They also list required freshman study breaks that educate students about identifying mental health issues as well as training tutors and proctors in early identification as resources that help with recognition.
Ultimately, as Schwartz notes, even the best resources do not guarantee that tragedies will not take place. “You have to think about it in the context of medicine,” he says. “You can have a cardiologist on every street corner, and there will still be people who die of heart attacks.” But the attacks can be reduced—and their effects eased—through the close collaboration of students, professionals, and campus administrators, grounding their efforts in concrete data and national comparisons, in pursuit of progress in mental health services among the country’s most vulnerable population.

Graduating FM executives share a few words of advice.
 
Sometime between your first Annenberg brunch and junior spring, most of the people you respect will start taking themselves very seriously. It happens slowly and subtly: People exaggerate and trip up, trying to establish themselves as the people they’re becoming before they’ve become them. They’ll buy bow ties and Barbours, quote Hegel and create a “Scene.” They’ll be moving a lot faster than you are, so it might seem like they’re winning some game that you didn’t even know you were playing. When that happens, this is what you should do: If someone is laughing at you, laugh at yourself. If you do something awkward, laugh at yourself. If you meet someone worth impressing, laugh at yourself. Everyone worth impressing can laugh at themselves, and most everyone sincerely laughing at themselves IS worth impressing.

Embrace Tasty Burger, just embrace it. Don’t sign up for 10 random clubs. Don’t be afraid to quit a club. Don’t bring your phone to Mather Lather. Don’t be that person who sets up lunch “appointments” three weeks in advance.

Stop thinking about what everyone else is doing. The only thing that matters is: What do I want to do? And sometimes figuring that out is hardest. But once you do (you will, I promise), go do it. Go teach kids, work in a lab, be King of IMs. Try something new. Learn to strum a ukulele, dance away on the Charles. Maybe it won’t make your resume look better, but it’ll make you happy. When you’re happy, you’ll know what you actually want to do with your life. It won’t matter what your type-A blockmate/pset buddy/teammate is doing. Sounds too simple, right? Perhaps it’s easier said than done. But the best part is, it’s a positive cycle. Just as long as you put your happiness first, everything follows.

We all talk indignantly about the “Harvard Bubble,” but few people do anything to pop it. My advice? Find an off-campus place to frequent, be it a small bar down Mt. Auburn Street or a fun café a few stops down the red line. A few hours away from Harvard Square can do a world of good, especially during exam period.
—Jose A. DelReal
Be OOC, not out of control. Make sure you and your roommates like to whine about the same things. Make up an alliterative theme for every day of the week, and pretend that it’s a real Thing. Pity people who don’t do Tartine Thursday. If you have a tendency to Google stalk, use caution when meeting “new” people. Don’t be too aloof, or everyone will think you hate them. Choose your favorite big word and use it excessively. Choose a new one. Sometimes you just need to have a craft day. Enjoy it.

I am about to say two things that have taken me four years to come to terms with and that will probably alienate every straight, single boy on campus:
I am a feminist, and I want to fall in love.
No less significantly, I want to be Meg Ryan. I recognize this as an aspiration that may be more difficult to realize than the former two, but I intend for that to change when I walk up to the hairdresser on Monday, hand her my card and say, “I want to be Meg Ryan,” or, maybe, “Please give me a shaggy bob to convey my bubbly but vulnerable personality.”
To clarify, the Meg Ryan in reference is not 51-year-old Meg Ryan, star of 2008 trainwreck “The Women,” ex-wife of Dennis Quaid through an affair with Russell Crowe, and adopted mother of a girl she named Charlotte until she realized, “I thought she was a Charlotte and she’s just not,” and renamed her Daisy True. I’m talking Nora Ephron’s Meg Ryan, star of “Sleepless in Seattle,” “You’ve Got Mail,” and, most importantly, “When Harry Met Sally”—the quality romantic comedies that, cultural critics and those with opinions about Katherine Heigl tell me, are dying.
In her commencement address to Wellesley College, Ephron famously said, “Above all, be the heroine of your life, not the victim.” Annie Reed, Kathleen Kelly, Sally Albright—Meg Ryan by several other names—are heroines. Wit being a primary symptom of heroism, it is notable that the current Meg Ryan, who is in a rather slimy relationship with John Mellencamp, is despairingly banter-deficient in comparison to the characters she portrays. The Meg Ryan I remember is the kind of heroine that, if she dies prematurely (à la Whitney Houston or Brittany Murphy), will inspire us all to say, “She's amazing, and the stagnation of her recent career is irrelevant given her earlier greatness, which we should all totally remember now.”
The heroines I admire—the funniest, most confident, well-traveled, and sassy—are considerably older. In middle school, I aspired to Diane Lane’s Tuscan romance. I dragged my mother to the theater to see Dustin Hoffman woo Emma Thompson through his daughter’s London wedding in “Last Chance Harvey.” Forgive me, future lovers, but winks will always be compared to the standards set by then 65-year-old Jack Nicholson in “Something’s Gotta Give.”
But in the past year critics have begun to loudly lament the end of “good” romantic comedies like “The African Queen,” “Annie Hall,” and “Jerry Maguire,” attributing their demise to the flaws and fickle desires of a younger generation with a penchant for instant and total gratification. Cue the emotional ignorance of YouTube-era youth and accompanying buzzwords: the end of romance (hook up culture!), men’s fear of women who want it all (feminism!), the breakdown of reasonable obstacles to courtship (the internet!), and a battle between the sexes that has become a war between the sexes that has become a pretty sad sexual standoff orbiting around some combination of empowerment, disappointment, and wine (SWUGs!).
“Dear Generation Y,” these conclusions seem to say, “men, sex, courtship, romance—they’re all over.” And whether your response is to invest box office dollars in alternative genres or to stay in on Friday to drink three bottles of Charles Shaw with your girlfriends after an unreciprocated text à la “heyyyyy,” you might as well admit it.
But giving up on romance at a young age is hardly Generation Y’s doing. Before Sally and Harry finally consummate their friendship, Sally voices the same anxiety felt by anyone who has ever confessed “being too quirky” as her biggest fear on a first date:
SALLY: But why didn’t he want to marry me? What’s the matter with me?
HARRY: Nothing.
SALLY: I’m difficult.
HARRY: You’re challenging.
SALLY: I’m too structured. I’m completely closed off…
HARRY: But in a good way.
SALLY: …And I’m going to be forty.
HARRY: When?
SALLY: Someday.
I’m 19 years to 40, but I’ll admit that my love life has not progressed very far since age 10, when I fell in love with Austin, who, within the span of a few fated weeks, played Zeus to my Hera in our Greek mythology presentations and Mr. Lou Who to my Mrs. Lou Who in our fifth grade production of “The Grinch.”
As I remember, in the weeks following the production, I spent hours sprawled across a couch with my best girlfriends, discussing whether or not he and I could be a Thing, and if we could, what kind of Thing we would be. We did all this while watching “Miss Congeniality” and eating fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies. Which, incidentally, and with the exception of preceding trips to Park, Russel, and the Owl, is exactly what I did last Saturday night.
So, as far as I’m concerned, the romantic comedy isn’t dead. The 90s are alive in Portland, and decades-old rom-coms are well-alive on my Netflix queue. And next weekend, shaggy bob a la tete, I’m going to go to Park, Russell, or the Owl, and I’m going to approach someone, and I’m going say something I think is funny and if he thinks it’s funny too (which won’t happen at the Owl), I’ll say something else. Maybe we’ll banter, and then, a few days later, we’ll go to coffee or, like, I don’t know, at least make out once during senior week. Because I’m a feminist, I want to fall in love, and if it means I’ll get to be anything like Meg Ryan or Diane Keaton, I’m pretty fucking stoked that I’m going to be forty…someday.

Here’s how the story goes: there was a guy and he wanted swans by the Charles so he asked the city and they let him put them there, right by the BU bridge. They were fed and visited regularly until construction started happening, but they didn’t have anywhere else to live. Most people didn’t know they were there, near the train tracks and men in hardhats working 9-5 days. The city tried to move them once, but somehow they always wound up back at the same place. That might not be how the story actually goes. That’s how it was told to me, anyways.
I can’t remember the name of the guy who told it to me, though I know he was a math type or a science type, a senior at BU. We met one day on a run during freshman year. It was still that gentle part of fall, a month before the cold grabs your breath as you inhale, pushing you back inside.
I used to wave to the runners I passed on the Charles, going the other way. It was the product of a small town—nod to everyone, even if you don’t recognize their face. Some gave confused glances, most were lost in the rhythms of their own pace. I stopped waving after mile three, on my first day.
By late September, I had become used to this kind of running: eyes straight, thoughts in another place. I didn’t pay much attention to the people around me, all of us trying to give in to the motions, lost completely, even though we knew the way.
But the math/science guy and I kept passing one another and, after three bridges, a joke had to be made. We talked for eight miles, though neither of us had planned to run for more than three. His bike was in the Square. We waved goodbye at the T.
We’d meet every Wednesday, at Harvard or BU. He was from the city, told me about the swans by the bridge and other places we passed through.
I ran with those stories after that semester, adding others over time. With my own, they make meaning of place. I think about them as I run along the Charles, time marked by bridges along the way.
I avoid Commonwealth Avenue completely, especially when it’s lit. Racing between Smoots to cross the river at MIT, I look for the apartments that were a church before being renovated. My Uncle lived in Central once, at the YMCA, where I pass but don’t go in. He and my dad bought beers at the “packie” on the corner; they walked, though the T was cheaper then. It was two years before I went back to the combination sushi-cellphone store in Chinatown, but I’m glad that we did. All of these places have mostly stayed the same, despite the changing perspective.
They’re not all stories I would choose to remember, though they provide the unconscious narrative to my walks and runs. I carry them with me into the city, and I can’t leave them behind on my return. I’ve gotten used to their company, though this has taken some time to learn.
I kick myself when I go running, scuff a heel on shin. I’m usually sore two days after, no matter the shape I’m in. But I know there is strength in stiff legs, my muscles getting torn down to be built again. Even the shortest runs can leave me aching; the longest are over too soon. I’ve run the same routes for eight semesters—with each, thought, muscle, and perspective are added. There is both newness and familiarity, each time I run through.
I guess that’s how stories and running work. At times uncomfortable, they can hurt like hell. But the route makes changes of its own, giving a kind of strength, and taking some as well. It leaves its marks, sure, but makes the next pain a little easier than the last.
I hadn’t been running by the river this spring—at least, not in the same direction as before. It had seemed time for new paths and stories, after three years of the same old turns. Still, I found myself along the Charles one day, returning to Harvard as I had many times before. Passing by BU, I tried to count the swans. They were dirty, among the construction. I counted 24.
I can’t remember the name of the boy. He couldn’t remember all of the facts. The story’s details matter less anyway. For me, they are only context. But it’s funny what we remember, what doesn’t come to mind so well, what we share, and what we keep to ourselves.
These stories are impermanent. We fit them into an inconstant landscape, while they themselves are bound to change. Legs become stronger and we forget where our scars were made. But the runs and the stories are what ground us, even when they remove us—temporarily—from a place. Blisters, callouses, narratives are what others see; what matters to us is our experience along the way.

 Fifteen Minutes: You just recently moved to Cambridge; what brought you here?
 Neil Gaiman: The original plan for this year: I was going to be living in England while my wife was going to be on tour for most of the year.… But then it all went wrong because her best friend Anthony came down with a horrible form of leukemia. I got a call from her saying, “Anthony has leukemia. I’m going to put off my tour. I should be in the Boston area. I’d like to live in Harvard Square, are you up for it?” And I said, “absolutely.” Originally we were just meant to be here until August, but we like it so much we asked the people whose house we are renting if they mind if we stay until December, and they don’t mind, so who knows? We may be here forever, just extending it in six months increments. But I do love it. I love the Harvardiness of things.
FM: Maurice Sendak once said, “I refuse to cater to the bullshit of innocence; I refuse to lie to children.” Your novels and stories tend to have a rather dark take on childhood, a grim account of being young. Do you feel it’s more truthful to tell it that way?
 NG: I do, but I don’t necessarily think it’s true that you need to tell children. I mean my new novel “The Ocean at the End of the Lane” begins with a quote from Maurice Sendak where he says, “I knew terrible things. But I knew I mustn’t let adults know. It would scare them.” It’s a novel in which the children know things that are much more terrible than the things the adults know. And at the end I had to decide, is this a children’s book or an adult’s book? I think it’s a book for anyone who’s ready for it, but I definitely wouldn’t hand it out to kids because it is a very dark book, and it doesn’t have much hope in it. A lot of what it’s about is childhood helplessness whereas I tend to look at something like “Coraline” and think it’s scary, it’s painful, it’s all of those things. It’s dark, but it’s fundamentally upbeat because it’s saying that dragons can be beaten. It’s saying, “yes, you can be brave, and brave does not mean you are not scared; it means you are absolutely scared and you do the right thing anyway.”
 FM: That’s G.K. Chesterton, isn’t it?
NG: That dragons can be beaten is. The bit about being brave anyway, I think, is me.
FM: Many of your stories are about looking back, be it echoing the terms history and mythology in “American Gods,” or your slantwise rendering of memory in “Sandman” and “The Ocean at the End of the Lane.” What do you think memory means for a child who’s especially young and in a way has less to remember?
NG: Kids remember their whole lives, just like adults. All you get to remember is your whole life. Do you remember how long a year was when you were a kid?
 FM: Very long.
NG: A very, very long time. You may not remember a year in the same way you remember it as an adult because you’ve only lived five of them, or seven of them, but they’re very long. It’s going to be a very long time until the next Christmas, the next birthday, and you’ll have changed so much. For adults, it’s a much faster, weirder kind of process, to the point where I can look around now…. But I think kids are really fascinated by memory. Kids are really fascinated by what they do and don’t remember. And the weirdest thing then becomes looking back at childhood memories and trying to remember if they’re really yours, or they’re just something that somebody told you. Do you remember this happening? Or were you simply told that this had happened and now your confabulating and putting some kind of memory together? I think memory is incredibly important. I think we are our memories. If you take away our memories we are nothing; we barely exist as human beings, so we have to start again.
FM: When you write from a child’s perspective, there’s often this tautology, this superficial but dulcet fascination in the way they think. How do you access that as a writer?
NG: You try and remember what it was like without—in Maurice Sendak’s words—“the bullshit.” The great thing for me about writing “Coraline” was that it was written when I had very young daughters around....As a parent you get to re-experience childhood from a different direction, which is really cool. I don’t think there’s anything mysterious about the fact that Charles Schultz’s work on “Peanuts” fell off after his kids grew up, and then when his grandchildren turned up it started getting interesting again toward the end. It’s not so much that you’re observing what they do; it’s much more that being around them puts you back in touch. My first graphic novel “Violent Cases” began with throwing my son Mike, who would have been three years old at the time, over my shoulder. He wouldn’t go to bed, so I threw him over my shoulder and I’m walking up the stairs with him banging on my back. And as I’m walking up the stairs I’m remembering being six years old and my dad doing the exact same thing to me and me going, “if I had kids I would never do this to them.” And yet, here I am. And that sort of became the key going into “Violent Cases,” which was the first thing for me that was an exploration of memory and of the weird intersections between memory and reality.
 FM: Speaking of your graphic novel work, I hear you’re working on a new “Sandman” series. What’s it like to return to something you haven’t written for 10 years?
NG: It’s not scary or troubling going back and working on it. That’s easy and fun. But it’s really scary and troubling feeling like a million people are looking over your shoulder. The world is waiting, and that’s horrible. That’s nerve-racking. It is so much more fun to write something that nobody is waiting for, nobody expects to be any good, nobody cares about, and then you give it to them and they go “this is wonderful!” That’s fun. “Sandman” so far there’s an awful lot of joy in it because I’m getting to write characters I haven’t written since 2002. …But there’s definitely, you know, does Death sounds like Death? Destiny sound like Destiny? Dream sound like Dream?
FM: What are you looking forward to most in life right now?
NG: Time. I really want more time. I’m looking forward to the giant summer promotional world tour being done. I’m looking forward to people not being mad at me anymore for being late on deadlines. I’m looking forward to a world in which I get to become really dull. I’m really looking forward to being duller. I’m having a great time saying no to things in 2014. And they’re amazing things! People say, “Do you want to come to Bali to a literary festival?” And I say, “No, I think I’ll stay home and write.”

By the relationships which [the Architect] creates he wakes profound echoes in us, he gives us the measure of an order which we feel to be in accordance with that of our world…. it is then that we experience the sense of beauty. —Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture.
On January 23, 1957, renowned architect and Dean of Harvard’s Graduate School of Design Josep Lluís Sert sat down to write a letter. Its mission: Convince the controversial modernist sensation Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier, to make his first visit to Cambridge. “Is there any chance of getting you to come here sometime next fall or spring?” he wrote. “Both MIT and this School are willing to do their best to get you to come here.”
Sert attempted to lure Le Corbusier with enticingly vague prospects. “If you can, in your very busy schedule, manage to spend two weeks here, we can guarantee a grand reception, and from that there are chances that other things may develop.”
The letter accomplished its task, and in November 1959, the then-72-year-old architect descended upon the red-brick low-lying textures of Harvard Square. Sert’s hints were soon made clear: During this trip, he would convince Le Corbusier to design a landmark new center for design and other arts at Harvard—what would become the Carpenter Center.
For several years Harvard administrators had discussed the merits of a single locus point for the arts at Harvard. In 1956, the authors of the Report of the Committee on the Visual Arts at Harvard University, also called “the Brown report” after its chair, John Nicholas Brown, wrote, “The time has come for a new sense of direction and renewed purpose if the study of art at Harvard is to flourish in the coming years.” A single building that would house all the arts was an integral part of this vision.
The project, then known as the Visual Arts Center, was financed by a $1.5 million donation by Alfred St. Vrain Carpenter, Class of 1905, and his wife, Helen Bundy. Even after the funds were secured, the question of who would design the building lingered and Le Corbusier was far from a given.
The Swiss-born architect had spent his formative years traveling around Europe, eventually settling in Paris in 1917. When he left for Cambridge in 1957, he still lived in the headquarters he had occupied since 1922, in a former Jesuit monastery at 35 Rue de Sèvres, on Paris’ Left Bank.
Central to Le Corbusier’s conception of architecture was the belief that modern design could perform a social function, improving living conditions and therefore society. By employing industrial advancements in the construction of geometrical towers and grids, Le Corbusier believed that these structures would better modulate inhabitants’ interactions with each other amid an inspiring environment. He used steel and glass materials, supported above the ground by pilotis, or concrete stilts—along with an open façade and floor plan, and a “Modulor” ratio system—in support of this framework. Le Corbusier’s most famous projects included Marseille’s Unité d’Habitation and Chandigarh, India’s first planned city. Yet many objected to his stout high-rises and “charmless” blocks of concrete—Bloomberg’s Colin Amery even once called him an “evil genius.”
But Sert, whose studio would design Harvard’s Holyoke Center and Science Center, along with the Fundació Miró museum in Barcelona, was eager to attract someone he considered to be forward-thinking. “Students who come here from every country in the world will work and study in this building,” he wrote to Le Corbusier, “and architectural design will be for them a constant source of inspiration and encouragement.”
He continued, “We feel you will be able to set a new pattern for this type of university building in the United States”—even though the Carpenter Center would be Le Corbusier’s only project in North America.
While many of the Center’s attributes would be consistent with Le Corbusier’s general oeuvre, several of its features derived from the architect’s first 1959 visit to Cambridge. He apparently found the hourly flurry of students in Harvard Yard striking, as they darted through intersecting pathways from one class to another. The distinctive ramp of today’s Carpenter Center is a legacy of that inspiration. This “climbing street” would also signal a nod to and link with Harvard’s architectural past along the Yard.
Nevertheless, many objected to the Center’s modern look, finding it jarring against the steady brick tradition of the rest of the Square. But Le Corbusier insisted that freedom, innovation, and creativity must define a building devoted to the arts. At several points he balked at suggestions made to him, spraying his letters to Sert with exclamation points and irony in his characteristic obstinacy from his home base of Paris.
“I absolutely refuse the ‘cement blocks’ inside the building—it’s awful!”
“Your builder coldly proposes getting rid of the mosquito nets. Is he going insane?”
Clashes between architect and critics continued through the opening of the Carpenter Center, on May 27, 1963, as Harvard administrators showered champagne onto the barely dried concrete. Fifty years later, the Center is no longer the only building in Harvard Square to contrast the College’s longstanding red-brick tradition. It continues to be a relic of a certain vision sprinkled throughout Le Corbusier’s designs around the world. The Center’s glass walls, for example, can be traced to the architect’s Paris Salvation Army project from 1920; its glass blocks find an echo in Paris’ 1930 Cité Universitaire. Le Corbusier’s interest in sun and light, consistent throughout his architectural projects, can be seen in the Carpenter Center through the shadows that changed depending on the time of day.
Recently, architectural historian Eduard F. Sekler spoke at the GSD’s Gund Hall to honor the fiftieth anniversary of the Carpenter Center. Sekler, the Center’s first director, recalled, “A lot of the traditional professors thought it was a disgrace.” Le Corbusier’s obstinate response came in the form of the Carpenter Center itself—and despite the initial outcry, and the continued criticism, the building signaled at least the momentary triumph of modernism in the arts at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent study at Harvard Medical School found that young adults in the United States between the ages of 18 and 25 utilized less health insurance coverage for their chronic asthma than adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 did.
“As a pediatrician, I knew that many adolescents with chronic diseases ‘slip through the cracks’ as they transition into young adulthood,” said Kao-Ping Chua, the leader of the study and a clinical fellow at HMS. “I wanted to find out how much of this was due to lack of health insurance.”
Chua, along with co-authors Mark A. Schuster and J. Michael McWilliams, found that while adolescents were more likely to use preemptive and primary care, young adults more frequently were treated in emergency rooms.
But though young adults with asthma were less likely to have health care than adolescents, this did not explain all of the variation in treatment.
The study, which was published by the science journal “Pediatrics” on April 22, found that differences in insurance coverage accounted for 32 percent of young adults’ decrease in use of primary care. It also found that between 47 and 61 percent of problems that occur as a result of lack of access to medicine or medical care were explained by the differences in insurance coverage, leaving a significant amount of the difference to be explained by other means.
“I was surprised by how strongly some of the social factors predicted changes in the health care utilization patterns of young adults with asthma,” Chua said.
Chua added that young adults who do not live with their parents, attend school, or have coverage through employment, are more likely to lack proper coverage for their chronic conditions. The study showed that this pattern is correlated with age.
With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, which requires that insurance plans allow young adults to stay covered by their families’ plans until the age of 26, there may be a change in the pattern of coverage and the effect of socioeconomic factors.
“It would be interesting to examine whether these insurance expansions help improve the care that young adults with asthma receive,” Chua said.
In the analysis, however, Chua says that this study raises more questions than it answers.
“Asthma care for young adults deteriorates in young adulthood and [there are] a few potential mediators for this deterioration,” Chua said. “We don’t know exactly what we can do about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Because of the work done by Olenka M. Polak ’15, non-English speakers will be able to go to the movie theater and enjoy blockbusters in their native tongues. myLINGO, the mobile application developed by Polak and her team, allows users to sync non-English dubs to movies in theaters in real time.
Polak and her team were among the winners of the Harvard College Innovation Challenge which seeks to reward students pursuing entrepreneurship on campus.
Polak and her brother, Adam Polak, first imagined the idea of dubbing in real time in July of 2012, when they noticed that their parents never joined them on trips to the movie theater. Polak’s parents, who primarily speak Polish, said there was no point if they could not understand the language spoken.
After this conversation, Polak and her brother searched for a way to share the movie theater experience with their parents.
“We were astounded that there wasn’t already a technology [like this],” Polak said.
Realizing they had a potentially marketable idea, Polak dove into the world of entrepreneurship, making use of research and office space at the Harvard Innovation Lab to develop what has become myLINGO.
“I had no idea what entrepreneurship was. I just thought [myLINGO] was a really good idea,” she said.
The Polaks have two patents pending on the technology that was finished in December, and plan to apply to distribute their application on the Mac App Store in two weeks.
Polak said that the resources she has had access to at the i-lab have been invaluable.
Describing the experts the i-lab brings in, Polak said, “They send a few emails and magic happens. I would not have my demo today if it were not for them.”
I-lab director Jodi Goldstein said that these resources are exactly the benefits that the i-lab can offer developing projects like myLINGO.
These resources include work space, workshops put on by experts in the field, mentorship by a current entrepreneur in residence, and immersion events into “entrepreneurial ecosystems,” among others.
myLINGO is one of over 100 ventures currently in residence at the i-lab, about 25 of which include undergraduates.
Goldstein said she was impressed by Polak’s project, especially given Polak’s young age. “[myLINGO] is such a simple, elegant solution to such a large problem,” she said.
Though Polak, whose brother currently works on the project full time, is considering taking time off from school to focus more on myLINGO, ultimately she said that she is committed to completing her studies.
While Goldstein said that she understands this dilemma faced by student entrepreneurs, she said she hopes the i-lab offers a way for students to continue their projects while staying in school.
“We want to support entrepreneurs at the University so students don’t have to drop out to pursue their dreams,” Goldstein said.

Speaking to an audience of professors and graduate students, Yale Law School dean Robert C. Post ’69 presented his case for a constitutional basis for campaign finance reform and argued against the Supreme Court’s controversial Citizens United decision which allows a certain degree of corporate participation in political campaigns based on the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
Post, speaking at a Tanner Lecture on Human Values in Lowell Lecture Hall on Thursday, made his case based on a theory of discursive democracy, in which all citizens have the right to a government which is “responsive” to their own electoral preferences—a goal he described as “electoral integrity.”
“Electoral integrity is necessary for the very First Amendment rights the courts and Citizen’s United are trying to protect,” he said.
Indeed, he argued, what the First Amendment ensures is the right of all citizens to have the “subjective experience” of engaging with their democracy to whatever degree they see fit.
“Corporations do not have the subjective experience of individuals,” Post said. “Corporations are things.”
Therefore, Post argued, they should not be treated as persons by the Constitution.
In addition to offering his own theory, Post presented the three arguments used more often in support of campaign finance reform in a representative democracy. To begin, he offered the ideas that the application of funds upsets the equality of democratic participation by all citizens, that those applications can distort public opinion, and that those funds can lead to a corruption of elected officials.
Predicting some counterarguments, Post further claimed that corporations also cannot be constitutionally protected “expressive associations,” whose purpose is to promote a point of view, but rather as “commercial associations” concerned with making a profit.
If corporations were in fact “expressive associations,” all corporate law would necessarily resort to First Amendment debate. As a result, corporate groups are considered qualitatively different from other political or expressive groups.
A response was given by Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig. Lessig, who is also director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, drew attention to the difficulty Post had in defining corruption, making a lighthearted jab at the Yale professor by implying that Harvard faculty might be less shy about confronting such a problem.
The discussion concluded with a question-and-answer session between the two speakers, moderated by Homi Bhabha, an English professor and director of the Mahindra Humanities Center.

Award-winning broadcast journalist Soledad M. O’Brien ’88-’00 visited the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Thursday for a discussion on her career and experiences in journalism.
The conversation covered many different issues, but focused on her coverage of race relations in CNN documentaries, “Black in America” and “Latino in America.”
O’Brien, a member of both the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, also reflected on her personal experiences and her mother’s strong influence on her developing identity when she was younger.
She said that her mother always instructed her, “Don’t let anyone tell you that you aren’t black or Latina,” she said. “[My mother] did a great job in helping me define who I was,”
O’Brien also discussed that society needs to change the discourse surrounding race and poverty.
“When we talk about people in poverty, we make them a collection of dysfunctions of their families,” she said.”
O’Brien proposed that people speak about those in poverty as individuals and not merely as products of their environments.
O’Brien described that some of her most memorable experiences in journalism were during reporting on Hurricane Katrina. She described her experience living in an RV for a week with the rest of the film crew after just giving birth to twins.
“It is the stuff like this that really matters,” O’Brien said. “That is what I want to spend my time on.”
Shaquilla T. Harrigan ’16 said she was impressed with O’Brien, adding that she also enjoyed how O’Brien kept “in contact with the human side of journalism, while keeping in contact with the story aspect as well.”
O’Brien—who is also one of next year’s visiting fellows for the Graduate School of Education—shared her enthusiasm for returning to Harvard for the first time in over a decade.
“I am so excited to be a part of what is a great experience academically,” she said. “What I felt tonight—people want to push, challenge, ask good questions, hold you accountable, and be part of the debate…that’s what great education is about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Philosophy Department at San Jose State University condemned Harvard government professor Michael J. Sandel’s teaching of the edX course ER22x: “Justice” in an open letter sent this week.
“We regard such courses as a serious compromise of quality of education and, ironically for a social justice course, a case of social injustice,” the letter read.
As edX approaches the first anniversary of its founding, it has received criticism from faculty members at several institutions of higher learning across the country.
Most recently, faculty members at Amherst College voted against participating in edX, describing MOOCs—massive open online courses—as unaligned with their commitment to a “purposefully small residential community.”
SJSU’s president pressured the dean of its College of Humanities of Arts to have JusticeX taught at the college following an April 10 announcement that SJSU would integrate edX into its lesson plans, according to SJSU’s philosophy department chair Peter J. Hadreas.
Hadreas said that because the philosophy department refused to use JusticeX in a flipped classroom approach, in which students watch video sequences and complete online exercises at home while class-time is then used to review difficult concepts, JusticeX will now be taught by SJSU’s English department.
“That is exactly the fear that we expressed. Eventually, you will only have facilitators for those courses. There will be no need for professors or even graduate students,” said Karin Brown, an SJSU associate philosophy professor.
“The English department is essentially teaching a course with absolutely no expertise—no philosophy master’s, not even a philosophy major, to teach an upper division class about philosophy,” she added.
Recently, MOOCs have been considered as potential solutions to funding shortages facing public universities, including in California where proposed legislation would grant credit for some online courses.
“It’s a very cheap way to solve the budget problem of public universities, but you are creating a university without professors,” Brown said.
In addition to citing concerns that JusticeX would replace professors, dismantle departments, and provide a diminished education for students in public universities, many SJSU philosophy professors said they were unsettled by the implicit message of having SJSU students watch the course as homework and then discuss it in class.
“The message is that students at Harvard deserve to have a live professor lecturing in front of them. They can make comments, ask questions, and have discussions with that professor, but San Jose students don’t,” said S. D. Noam Cook, an SJSU philosophy professor. “That seems to be quite inappropriate for any department in any university.”
Professors also said that Sandel’s targeting of Harvard students might not be applicable to SJSU students because of differences in experiences and demographics.
“Some of our students are first generation, undocumented, or wake up in the morning asking whether they belong in a university at all,” said Rita C. Manning, an SJSU philosophy professor. “Their experience is going to be central to what we teach here.”
SJSU philosophy associate professor Janet D. Stemwedel said that the refusal to integrate JusticeX into the classroom is not a rejection of online learning.
“We’re actually a department that has developed a number of online and blended courses,” she said. “We are prepared to use all kinds of tools to engage our students, but we want to engage our students.”
In a letter responding to the concerns, Sandel acknowledged issues inherent in online courses replacing traditional classroom courses, but wrote that his goal was “simply to make an educational resource freely available.”
“The worry that the widespread use of online courses will damage departments in public universities facing budgetary pressures is a legitimate concern that deserves serious debate,” he wrote. “The last thing I want is for my online lectures to be used to undermine faculty colleagues at other institutions.”
Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, defended edX in a statement approved by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
“While Harvard students are fortunate to be able to attend Professor Sandel’s courses on campus, we expect that learners beyond our campus will continue to benefit from the ability to view them online, whether individually or as part of coursework at another educational institution,” he wrote.
But SJSU philosophy professors remain steadfast.
“I could retire tomorrow. I don’t need this job, but our students need us,” Manning said.

Part Five of a five-part series on Harvard's approaching capital campaign. Part One was published on April 29, Part Two on April 30, Part Three on May 1, and Part Four on May 2.
The last time Harvard launched a full-fledged capital campaign, it was 1994 and Drew G. Faust was still teaching history at the University of Pennsylvania. That fundraising drive, guided by then-University President Neil L. Rudenstine, surpassed its initial goals to raise a total of $2.6 billion by the time it concluded in 1999.
Today, Harvard is preparing for the September launch of a new capital campaign that looks to raise a sum that could be triple the haul accumulated in the 1990s.
To fund ambitious projects like House Renewal and the growth of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard must raise more money from an increasingly diverse pool of alumni in a more competitive marketplace for charitable donations.
To meet these new challenges, Harvard may look back to lessons learned from its 1990s campaign. It may also turn an eye toward its peer institutions, like Stanford and MIT, who have recently run successful capital campaigns in the 21st century.
A BIGGER PRICETAG
The number of multi-billion dollar capital campaigns has been on the rise since 2000, according to Rae Goldsmith, a vice president at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education.
Currently there are over 30 such campaigns taking place at universities across the country.
And with universities looking to fund the new technologies necessary to pursue cutting edge research, the pricetags on these campaigns are rising too.
Between 2006 and 2011, Stanford ran a capital campaign, entitled The Stanford Challenge, which raised $6.23 billion—the most of any university campaign ever, according to school officials.
For these schools, deciding how much money to raise is an important preliminary step.
Senior Harvard administrators have said that the upcoming campaign will likely look to raise at least $6 billion—a figure that could soar even higher.
Faust, the University President, said that Harvard will gauge the appropriate fundraising goal in part by taking into account the recent campaigns at peer institutions.
“If you look at other university campaigns and you look at us in comparison to their size, you get a sense of the ballpark, but we’ll come up with a number when we’re a little closer to the launch,” Faust said in an interview in early March.
Harvard may also look back to its previous campaigns and consider the success of its current two-year “quiet phase” of fundraising to help set a target for the public campaign.
“You have a lot of guidance based on past history of giving, what you’re able [to raise] in the so-called quiet phase of the campaign, while you’re collecting commitments and gifts but not yet declaring a goal,” said Harvey V. Fineberg ’67, who was University provost and one of the most prominent fundraisers during Harvard’s last capital campaign. “That gives you a sense whether a given goal is a proper stretch but not so outrageous to be unlikely to be met.”
MORE DIVERSE DONORS
As it looks to raise more money than ever before, Harvard must appeal to a different kind of donor.
The University has traditionally turned to a homogeneous alumni base when raising money. These past fundraising efforts drew from “fewer international students, fewer people of color, fewer women, for that matter, who were in the alumni ranks,” according to Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for alumni affairs and development.
But since then, the demographics of the Harvard student body have shifted dramatically, as financial aid programs have expanded, minority recruiting has been introduced, and the international student population has grown—in turn resulting in a more diverse alumni base.
Rogers said that this altered pool of donors requires more complex networking on behalf of her development office, as alumni live in more diverse locations and navigate in a wider variety of social circles.
“You just have to be much broader in your outreach and more thoughtful,” Rogers said. “It’s not the case that everyone is concentrated in one or two areas, or the case that everyone knew each other, so to speak, in college.”
This new heterogeneity can also create new opportunities for schools like Harvard, opening the door to a wealth of untapped pockets of patrons.
“As institutions have grown their base of international students, that base can then translate into potential donors from all over the world,” Goldsmith said.
Rob Scott, campaign director at MIT’s Office of Campaign Planning, said that globalization has been a boon for university fundraising. MIT wrapped up a $2 billion campaign in 2004, and is in the beginning stages of another major fundraising drive.
“The fact that we live in a world that is increasingly seen as deeply connected throughout networks and that things that happen on different continents have an impact on each other helps with talking with international alumni,” Scott said.”
A MORE COMPETITIVE FIELD
In courting this increasingly diverse pool of alumni, Harvard must employ new messaging strategies to win over donors whose attention—and checkbooks—are pulled in multiple directions.
Scott said that universities must compete with a wider array of charitable causes.
“For a long time, higher education institutions were the only organizations that attracted such philanthropic support,” Scott said. “Now there’s just such a rich variety of ways for people to get involved.”
This proliferation of philanthropic organizations has made it more difficult for universities to stake their claims in fundraising, Scott said.
By way of solution, Fineberg said, universities are pitching broad, multidisciplinary priorities to diverse donors to attract their support.
“You’re finding more of the [priorities] about the University fundraising effort relating to topics that do cut across a variety of faculties,” Fineberg said. “That’s a strong development that I think will both strengthen the University and make the fundraising more interesting.”
The Stanford Challenge, for instance, outlined eight initiatives that included broad priorities like “human health” and “engaging in the arts and creativity.”
Universities have given their recent capital campaigns sweeping titles like “The Stanford Challenge” and “Cornell Now” to communicate a central inclusive theme that unites their diverse priorities.
At Harvard, this central campaign theme, which has yet to be announced, may look to do something similar as it tells what Rogers described as “a big, compelling story” about the University.

Calling for comprehensive solutions to the water crisis in the West Bank, Tufts professor Annette Huber-Lee and Palestinian refugee Nidal al-Azraq presented work on improving Palestinian access to adequate safe water at an event hosted Thursday evening by the Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy.
Though the Israeli-Palestinian Joint-Water Committee is responsible for water allocation in the West Bank, Huber-Lee said that in practice, Israel controls most of the water and severely restricts Palestinian access.
She said that 80 percent of water in the Mountain Aquifer, one of the most important sources of water for both Israelis and Palestinians, goes to Israel, while only 20 percent goes to Palestine.
“This illustrates how problematic the current allocation is,” she said. “Technically, the JWC operates by consensus...the reality is [that] Israel pretty much has veto power.”
For their part, Israelis argue that they provide more water to Palestinians than the Oslo Accords agreement requires them to give, according to the Christian Science Monitor.
Huber-Lee’s research project in the West Bank, which seeks to answer the question of how water allocation in the area could be modified, takes an economic approach to the water crisis.
“The project was thinking about water value, rather than strict water quality,” she said. “I dispute the idea that water should be regulated by the free market.”
Huber-Lee stated that an unregulated market allowed Israel to exercise excessive control over water in the West Bank. She added that a few concessions on Israel’s part would greatly improve the lives of Palestinians at little to no economic cost to Israel.
“I’ve never seen a more intense system of water control anywhere,” she said. “Palestinians pay 10 times more for water than Israelis.”
Nidal al-Azraq, a researcher and Palestinian refugee who assisted Huber-Lee, described the Aida Refugee Camp—where he grew up—as an area that exemplifies the dearth of Palestinian access to water.
“The whole camp is a sad joke,” al-Azraq said.
He stated that water comes by sporadically and that there are sometimes months of drought during the summers, when people store water in tanks on their rooftops.
al-Azraq called Israeli control of water in the West Bank a human rights issue, calling the current state of water allocation a “crime against humanity.”
Israelis, however, argue that the Palestinian water shortage is a product of Palestinians’ poor management, maintenance, and pricing of their existing resources, according to the Christian Science Monitor.

UPDATED: May 6, 2013, at 1:03 a.m.
Harvard College students have received eight of the thirty 2013 Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans, which offer financial assistance to first- and second-generation immigrants pursuing graduate studies.
The program aims “to honor the American Immigrant Tradition—to remind people of the contributions immigrants have historically made—and to honor individuals who are clearly well-positioned to continue in that tradition,” Soros program director Stanley J. Heginbotham said.
The fellowship program seeks to identify students who show creativity, initiative, and innovation.
“Our view is that past is prologue,” said Heginbotham. “We look for students whose prior accomplishments demonstrate these qualities—students who have that spark, if you will.”
Students’ personal histories, families, opportunities, and challenges also factor into the selection process.
This year’s fellows were selected from a pool of over 1,050 applicants. Each Fellow will receive up to $90,000 in tuition and stipend assistance for graduate education in the United States.
Recipient Amrapali Maitra ’10 will use the fellowship to continue working towards an M.D. and a Ph.D. in anthropology at Stanford University. Maitra said she hopes to “mobilize her education and privilege” to help South Asian women facing violence in their homes and communities.
Fellow Vivek Viswanathan ’09, who will use the award to continue pursuing joint J.D. and M.B.A. degrees at Stanford University, said he aspires to make a difference in politics and to one day run for public office.
Viswanathan expressed gratitude for the support he received from Harvard professors and staff after graduating, citing recommendations from government professor Roger B. Porter, who supervised his thesis, and Kris Locke, a former program manager at the Harvard Bridge Center for his fellowship application.
Both Maitra and Viswanathan said they appreciate the way in which the program unites fellows.
“One of the primary reasons I applied for the fellowship was to meet a community of scholars similarly shaped by immigrant experiences,” said Maitra.
Viswanathan, who “is very excited to be part of the community,” said he is looking forward to convening with the 2012 and 2013 fellows in the fall.
Amar Bakshi ’06, Sangu J. Delle ’10, Senan Ebrahim ’12, Mariam O. Fofana ‘06, Ryaan Ahmed ’11 and Dayan “Jack” Li ’11 were the other recipients of the Soros fellowship from the College. Additionally, current Harvard law student Eva Bitran and medical school students Omar Abudayyeh, Dana Im, Wilfredo Matias, and Samsiya Ona were also named Soros fellows.

A team of Harvard researchers have created what they say is the smallest robotic insect capable of flight—a nickel-sized prototype called RoboBee—that could one day be deployed in swarms for tasks, including environmental monitoring and search-and-rescue operations.
In August, the researchers’ device lifted off for the first time and flew through a sequence of patterns in the air.
“This is the first time that we’ve gotten a robot this small to be controlled in stable flight,” said Kevin Y. Ma, a lead co-author of the paper. “It was a huge relief that all of the effort we put in...finally paid off with a stable controlled flight.”
Principal investigator Robert J. Wood, a professor of engineering and applied sciences, has been working to create robotic insects for the past 12 years.
His team has been flying RoboBees since 2007, but previous models were limited because the motion of flight was constrained.
In order to achieve a full range of motion in three dimensions, the latest model required the RoboBee to have independent control over its two wings, Ma said.
The device weighs only 80 milligrams, which is slightly less than an average honeybee.
“We have to minimize the mass of the structure while adding functionality, and so that required a lot of thinking into how you efficiently utilize the very limited space that you have on the robot,” Ma said.
The RoboBee collaboration includes nine Harvard faculty members, a professor at Northeastern University, and industry partner Centeye, according to its website.
While Wood and his team are focused on manufacturing individual RoboBees with the capabilities of flight, other researchers are designing systems that allow the RoboBees to communicate with each other.
Eventually, the researchers hope to equip these miniature robots with sensors and use them to solve complex tasks as a swarm.
For instance, RoboBees with heat and carbon dioxide sensors could be used to detect human bodies in the aftermath of a natural disaster.
Currently, the lab’s prototype is attached to a wire, which provides electrical power and control. Ma said that future research would involve placing all of this functionality onboard the RoboBee, while maintaining a lightweight design.
“The next steps for us are to make the robot fully wireless,” Ma said. “That will involve a lot more research in the miniaturization of batteries, electronics, and sensors.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The path to becoming a rower is different for every person. Rowing is Harvard’s oldest sport but it is not widely practiced in high schools and requires significant dedication from a young age, so for the budding athlete it may not always be the obvious choice.
But for lightweight co-captain Matt O’Leary, rowing has always been a part of his life.
His mother, Liz O’Leary, is the current women’s heavyweight coach at Harvard and has been coaching rowing since before Matt was born. The Westwood, Mass., native has been running around the Harvard boathouse since he was two years old.
“You can’t grow up not knowing about the sport if you grow up in the boathouse,” Matt said. “I started rowing in seventh grade.”
Liz had a distinguished career as a rower, competing for the U.S. national team at the Olympic Games in 1976 and 1980, and then coaching the team itself in 1988.
Perhaps surprisingly then, both mother and son agree it was not his familial ties to rowing which led him to where he is today.
“I never thought [it was inevitable],” Matt said. “I always wanted to be a hockey player.”
Liz too recalled Matt trying a number of sports. As a kid he played baseball, soccer, and hockey at various times, and even had his dad coach him in lacrosse.
“He certainly knew he wanted to play something,” Liz said. “He was a hockey goalie. That was his primary sport when he was younger.”
While Matt cannot remember what drew him to rowing in the first place, his mother offered up one explanation.
“The thing about Matt is [that] he likes to do things just a little bit differently,” Liz said. “If he’s on the hockey team, he wants to be the goalie, and of all the sports you could choose for a spring sport, [he thought], ‘what would be the most off the beaten track?’ That will be [rowing] in most high school environments, [so] that’s what he did…. I don’t think it had much to do with me.”
Whatever his reasons for starting out, as he moved through high school, Matt was still competing in a number of sports as a talented athlete, with crew simply comprising the spring portion of his athletic year.
As in the case of many athletes, though, it was the arrival of a coach which changed Matt’s path permanently.
“[High school crew coach Gavin Grant] is the reason I’m here,” Matt said. “If he hadn’t showed up, we would have stayed as a pretty average team, and I probably wouldn’t have kept rowing in college. But he showed us how to train hard, how to win races. That pretty much transformed what I wanted to do in college and afterwards."
Grant came to Noble and Greenough School as a coach at the beginning of Matt’s junior year and rapidly created a culture of success.
In his senior year, Matt rowed as part of the varsity four that won the national championship in 2009. It was a remarkable turnaround for a team which Matt himself described as fairly average up to that point.
“Between Matt and a couple of the other guys on the team, there was some great leadership and great potential there,” Grant said. “A number of the guys that were in that boat went to row in college at quite successful programs so I think there was a lot of potential in the group. Once the leadership showed, it helped them get their speed [and] get some of that competitive instinct that maybe they didn’t have as underclassmen.”
Grant did not shape Matt into a rower, but rather revealed a talent which had been there all along.
Matt cited two reasons for why he will be training with the USRowing team in Oklahoma City this summer rather than trying to get drafted in the NHL as he originally dreamed. He improved much more at crew than he ever did at hockey, and the sport of rowing rewards the skill Matt has most in abundance—diligence.
“I think the most rewarding part about [rowing] is that how good you end up being is directly correlated to how hard you work,” Matt said. “If you want to put in the time to go fast, you can do it. I know you can’t be successful if you don’t have the drive to push yourself beyond where you are comfortable. That’s how everyone on the team here ends up here.”
Matt acknowledges that practice improves one’s hockey performance as well, but not to the same degree as with rowing. There was always an element of chance involved, which was on some level frustrating for the extremely disciplined Matt.
“[Matt] is a pretty determined individual and he has worked hard to be where he is,” Liz said. “He’s put in the time and the focus that you need to do what he has done, or rather, what he is doing.”
Matt’s discipline and commitment to hard work has certainly reaped benefits in his career thus far.
Through four years of collegiate rowing, O’Leary’s boats have never lost a single dual meet.
Standing as co-captain on the No.1 ranked boat in the nation, he will be heading to EARC Sprints and then most likely to the IRA National Championships for one last time in the coming weeks.
While the Crimson record books will note down the four years of remarkable accomplishments of his senior class, the reason behind Matt’s success will be left out.
There is no box score, just as there is no replacement for strong commitment.
“You never have to wonder if O’Leary is pulling his weight,” sophomore lightweight rower Rob Hawthorne said. “He’s often the first person in the boathouse in the morning and one of the last ones to leave. He invests a lot of time and energy making sure he’s getting faster and he expects the same of everyone else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard track and field team will no longer be divided up and spread out at meets across the country. No longer will the team be up against the likes of LSU and Florida, nor will it be racing in front of the Penn Relays’ 50,000 spectators.
Although the powerhouse teams will be absent and the crowd more modest, this is the most important weekend of competition for the Crimson to date. Harvard will travel to Princeton’s Weaver Stadium to square off against its seven Ivy League rivals in the Outdoor Heptagonal Championships. The oft-divided squad will be united for one of the few times this season with its runners, jumpers, and throwers all in pursuit of a singular goal: to bring an Ivy title back to Cambridge.
“A lot of what we do is to get ready for this competition and beyond,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We really gear things toward the championship part of our season, which starts this weekend.”
The Crimson women will look to replicate its somewhat-surprising championship at February’s Indoor Heps. Despite falling to Princeton just two weeks before the competition, Harvard put together a complete team effort to nab its first Ancient Eight crown in 13 years.
“[Winning Indoor Heps] has certainly given them some confidence, but I think it’s also made them hungry for more,” Saretsky said. “I think they’re really looking forward to getting after it again this weekend.”
If the Crimson hopes to knock off Cornell, Columbia, and Princeton again, it will need stellar showings from its top competitors, like freshman sprinter Autumne Franklin.
The first-year has run the top times in the Ivies in both the 100 and 400-meter hurdles this season. If she is in top form this weekend, she can rack up 20 points for the Harvard women in the two events alone, more than one-sixth of the team’s total of 117 points at Indoor Heps.
Also key to the Crimson’s success will be the performance of sophomore Erika Veidis, who is currently ranked No. 1 in the Ivy League in the 800-meter run.  Right behind the sophomore in the rankings is Princeton’s Greta Feldman, who narrowly edged Veidis for first in the event last year.
“[Feldman] is an incredible athlete,” Veidis said. “She’s coming off a really strong performance at Penn Relays…so it could come down to us two battling it out in the home stretch.”
In recent meets, Veidis and Franklin have teamed up—along with freshman Gabrielle Scott and sophomore Christi Scott—in the 4x400-meter relay. The squad set a school record two weekends ago, and their performance could have major implications for Harvard’s final place in the standings this weekend.
At Indoor Heps, the Crimson held a slight lead over the Big Red going into the 4x400, the meet’s final race. If the Harvard foursome had faltered, the Big Red would have walked away with the Ivy crown.
While the Crimson women are seeking to defend their title, the men’s squad will be looking to build upon its best finish at Heps since 1985. Propelled by the dominance of its throwers, the men’s team took third place behind Princeton and Cornell.
While being competitive with the Tigers and Big Red is an unrealistic goal for Harvard, as both teams nearly doubled its point total at Indoor Heps, the Crimson will once again rely on its throwing corps to have an edge on its other five opponents.
Senior Edward Brucker, junior Dustin Brode, and sophomores Ben Glauser and Igor Liokumovich have been strong contributors for Harvard all season. Brode, who won the shot put at Indoor Heps with a throw of 18.18 meters, will face heavy competition from Cornell sophomore Stephen Mozia, who has the top-ranked throw of the season in the Ancient Eight. Mozia’s mark is the third best all-time in the conference, and he is the only Ivy athlete to surpass 60 feet this season.
“The men’s throwers have been our rock bed for a number of years now,” Saretsky said. “It’s a very talented group, definitely one of the strongest in the Ivy League, possibly in the history of the League.”
Junior distance runners Maksim Korolev and James Leakos, who have been climbing the school record board this season, will have square off against strong competition in their events. Leakos and Korolev are ranked second in the 5k and 10k runs, respectively.
“The season’s gone really well so far, we’ve basically rewritten the record books with some of the all-time [best] performances  throughout the season,” Saretsky said. “This is arguably one of the best groups that’s come through Harvard in a long, long time. I’m excited to see how we match up against the rest of the Ivy League.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s hockey team takes to the ice this upcoming October, something will be different.
Crimson coach Katey Stone, the winningest coach in Division I history, is headed overseas. She will take with her the 402 Division I wins, six ECAC championships, and one national championship she has earned in 19 seasons at the helm for the Crimson when she goes.
“It’s hard to imagine Harvard hockey without coach,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “She’s the best at what she does."
With Dempsey graduating this spring, a whole new crop will usher in the new era in Harvard hockey.
“One of the main reasons I came to this school to play is because [Stone] is an awesome coach,” freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer said of her coach. “But I am extremely confident in [interim head coach Maura] Crowell and [assistant coach Haley] Moore.”
Crowell was announced as the interim coach this week after Stone’s decision  to coach the U.S. Olympic Squad next year.
“It’s a great opportunity for her,” Stone said. “She has earned it and I think she will do a great job."
After Crowell got a job with her prep school out of college, she landed at UMass Boston, where she became the winningest coach in the Division III school’s history.
While there, Crowell set a program record for wins in a season, ranked second among all ECAC East coaches in winning percentage, and had several successful playoff campaigns including a pair of semifinals appearances.
The newly named interim head coach arrived at Harvard in 2009 as an assistant after attending a coaching symposium that brought her and coach Stone’s staffs together.
In her capacity as an assistant, Crowell has maintained a strong connection with both the head coach and the players.
“[Coach Stone] has been a great mentor for the past 30 years,” Crowell said. “She allows me to do a lot within the program and learn a lot.”
In Crowell’s mind these connections are facilitated by shared beliefs.
“Part of the reason we work so well together is that we value very similar things,” Crowell said. “Hard work is always going to be at the heart of Harvard hockey.”
The concept of team has been made especially salient for this season’s group of girls. On road trips, Stone would always have her squad bring signs reading “Team First.”
“You realize how much of a mentality and mindset it is,” Dempsey said. “There is no other program in the country that has that team aspect.”
This past season the Crimson reached the NCAA quarterfinals, falling just short of its fourth Frozen Four under Stone’s direction. Crowell hopes to continue the Crimson’s current trajectory.
“I know how Katie would want things to go and I just plan to continue it,” Crowell said.
But assuming Stone’s place behind the bench will be no easy task.
Stone always had a knack for leading. By the time her senior year rolled around, the Connecticut native was captain of both the hockey and lacrosse teams at the University of New Hampshire.
At Harvard, Stone jumped right into the mix learning the head coaching position with no experience with college hockey whatsoever.
After a couple of losing seasons, Stone shocked the women’s college hockey world, going 33-1 with a team that recorded a losing record just a season earlier.
Thirteen seasons later, the Crimson has yet to register another losing season.
But it wasn’t Stone’s impressive pedigree, wealth of experience, or tactical decision-making that made her special in the eyes of her players.
“What sticks out to me is coach at the board during practice drawing up drills,” Dempsey said. “It’s those type of everyday moments. She is always excited to be there."
“She protects us and will do anything for every one of us,” Maschmeyer added. “So it’s a pretty great feeling having a coach like that.”
When Stone coaches in 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, she will make history, becoming the first woman to hold the post since women’s hockey became an Olympic sport in 1998.
“It’s pretty amazing,” Dempsey said. “I think it is a big step forward for a woman to hold a leadership position like that.”
Stone will also be among a small contingent of Harvard coaches to travel with Olympic teams at one point in time.
“It’s hard to imagine that our coach here at Harvard is going to be the Olympic coach,” Dempsey said. “But they definitely have the right person for the job.”
This winter should be a fun one in Cambridge as Stone enters the next phase of her career and the Crimson attempts to navigate uncharted territories.
“It’s going to be weird,” Stone said when asked if it has hit her that she is not going to be back next year. “But it’s going to be great. I am looking forward to [coach Crowell]’s taking the job.”
