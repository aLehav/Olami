After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among President Obama’s numerous declarations during the State of the Union last week, one of the more noteworthy commitments he made was to increasing the affordability of higher education. In reference to the ballooning costs of attending college, Obama highlighted one of the central problems that face America’s young adult population—the increasing cost of a college degree in a society increasingly demanding one. While this is the unfortunate result of a myriad of factors, the current federal aid system is insufficient to ameliorate these issues and must be improved.
Ultimately, a federal solution is necessary to combat the outsized costs of an education; the government must take the initiative to dramatically increase the federal aid it provides to universities, particularly public universities. These institutions currently offer some of the most economical options to the largest number of people. By providing these institutions and their students more financial support, the government will not only encourage more individuals to pursue a college degree using the route that is already the most common, but it will also make it more financially palatable for those who have already decided to do so.
Nevertheless, there are other immediate steps the government can take to help prospective students achieve long-term financial success. One of the administration’s primary goals should be to demystify the confusion surrounding the benefits of a college education. High school seniors are currently fed copious amounts of information about the merits of a bachelor’s or master’s degree from a plethora of (often self-interested) sources. This marketing instills the erroneous belief that an expensive degree is tantamount to an assurance of future prosperity, regardless of the skills actually acquired as a student. This is patently false. For reasons beyond anyone’s control, the market for graduates with degrees outside the realms of math and science is smaller than the market for those with more quantitative skills. As such, students should be encouraged at least to explore options in fields whose skills are likely to be the most relevant after college.
This is not to diminish the academic, cultural, or social value of any academic field. In a perfect world, everyone would have the luxury of studying whatever one wished without it affecting his or her future salary. However, to pretend it is acceptable to bet hundreds of thousands of dollars on a degree without regards to its content ignores reality, The government should push back against the myth that all degrees are equally marketable and strive to educate students on the different opportunities different degrees confer.
Another measure the federal government can take to decrease student debt would be engaging in a widespread crackdown on for-profit colleges. In the struggle to increase college affordability, some of the most shameful offenders are these institutions. Many of these colleges violate not only the spirit, but also the letter of the law, engaging in practices such as accepting fraudulent high school credentials and plagiarized coursework, lying about the cost of degrees, and allegedly paying admissions officers to increase enrollment. Many are guilty of bait-and-switch tactics to entice students to matriculate. Recently, bureaucratic progress had been made towards properly regulating the for-profit college industry. However, as a result of heavy lobbying, many of these changes have been scaled back. This is wholly unacceptable. The goals of turning a profit and providing an education are incompatible and should not intersect.
That said, for-profit institutions are by no means the sole culprit. A host of schools, many of which receive taxpayer dollars (through either Pell Grants or direct funding), report what many would consider unacceptably low graduation rates. For example, the ten schools with the lowest federally reported graduation rates in the Washington D.C. area include nonprofit as well as for-profit institutions. The department of education needs to reevaluate its financial relationship with schools that consistently fail to graduate students, regardless of profit or nonprofit status. While it may seem harsh, the government should not continue to spend money on failed or failing institutions that could be used elsewhere unless those schools can provide a credible means to improve performance. Such measures are reasonable as families are not bound by location to a specific college like they would be to a high school or elementary school, removing any obligation the government has to provide educational opportunity based on proximity. Committing funds to one school instead of another is a mutually exclusive activity; such money should not be wasted.
The United States government has many tools at its disposal to reduce student debt, but it must begin with increasing federal aid to schools that could use it most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at Harvard do not often discuss failure seriously. We sometimes speak ironically about failure, but we won’t talk about it earnestly. We deploy it self-mockingly, which leaves us neither vulnerable nor more self-aware. I wonder if there isn’t something unfortunate about this habit, something that could be gained by talking more earnestly about failure—what it means, if it matters, or what we might learn from it that could serve us well in the future.
Last week I experienced a bout of self-styled failure of the type that seems only possible for seniors on the cusp of “the real world” and all of its discontents. In the span of a few short days, I was rejected by three post-graduate fellowships, my thesis writing stalled in a pool of senseless intellectual muddle, and I realized that I would need to find a job in the coming months. I imagined that my job search would involve marketing myself with catchphrases like “critical thinker” and “well-versed in conceptual analysis and contextualization,” lest I end up back at my parents’ house come September.
What struck me most about all of this was the difficulty in talking about it with people at Harvard—even close friends. I don’t mean that I felt uncomfortable sharing it, about exposing my own ineptitude or disappointment: in fact, I almost always feel more comfortable sharing my failures than I do sharing my successes. Instead, I found that people at Harvard have difficulty holding a serious discussion about failure in the lives of our friends and classmates.
Our immediate response upon hearing about the failures of our friends is dismissal. We explain to them why it was a mistake, a fluke, an error that someone else made, anyone’s fault but theirs. We tell them, “You got passed over for that job/fellowship/law school spot? Impossible. You’re the most qualified person I know. Someone clearly made a mistake.” Or we immediately point to some possible future success and expound upon its inevitability: “What? You didn’t get the Brumblehall Fellowship for the Study of Medieval Armory? Well, you will definitely get the Pumpernickle Fellowship—I have no doubt in my mind.”
When my friends attempt to reassure me in this way, I always want to yell back, “Well, I do have doubt in my mind! In fact, I’m seriously doubting my chances right now, as I should be, since 100 people applied for the same spot as I did!” But I can’t yell that, and instead I inevitably shrug my shoulders and mumble something about odds and back-up plans. Of course, this is partially because exuberant praise embarrasses those of us brought up to value modesty.  However, it is also because such extreme faith often seems misplaced, refusing as it does the possibility that we might just not be as successful as we had hoped.
I don’t mean to demonize this behavior; it is natural. Harvard is a stressful place, and we all hope that by dismissing failures and extolling the virtues of future glory we can make our friends’ lives less stressful. But I wonder if we sometimes miss an important moment of growth and development by denying failure. As a senior—while my classmates are continuously (and deservingly) winning fellowships, medical school offers, and jobs at McKinsey and Co—I can’t help but feel that it might be beneficial to sit down and talk seriously about failure.
­Many Harvard students have never seriously failed at anything in their life, and many feel understandably uncomfortable talking about disappointment with their own parents. Failure exposes our weakness, brings out our insecurities, and clouds our vision of the future—but it is a permanent fixture of human experience, both inevitable and perhaps invaluable to the real richness of life. By dismissing it, we risk missing its lessons and overlooking its centrality to our own self-improvement. We ought to struggle with failure, to think about what it means for our expectations and our goals. It provides an opportunity to learn a lesson about our own limitations and capabilities sooner, rather than later—at a time when opportunities to begin anew are not so difficult to come by.
This does not mean that we should stop cheering up our friends, nor does it mean that we should avoid contextualizing failure by pointing out how well situated most of us truly are, with the force of the Harvard name on our diploma and the wealth of its resources at our disposal Talking about failure can be difficult; I suspect that such discussions will always be uncomfortable. But the challenge is worth undertaking. Failure today may be the loss of a relationship, the sting of a bad grade, or the inability to find post-collegiate employment, but life often brings more weighty difficulties—infidelity, financial trouble, and death. Learning to talk about these experiences and learn from them is a process worth embarking upon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What is an unmet promise called? Per our colloquial phrasing, a promise not kept is deemed “broken,” a subtle linguistic reminder of our reverence for the oath. That esteem for the promise exists throughout our culture. In the Bible, Moses exhorts, “When a man… binds himself under oath to a pledge, he shall not violate his word.” In the legal arena, common law long prohibited “breach of promise,” holding would-be husbands accountable for unfulfilled ring-giving (a practice that, be advised, still sits on the books in some states). And at the edge of the great abyss, Robert Frost, that great American poet, famously reminded himself, “But I have promises to keep.”
Incidentally, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., partial to that ethos of promise-keeping, borrowed Robert Frost’s words for his autobiography, titled “Promises to Keep.” Support or opposition for Mr. Biden aside, that emphasis on keeping promises seems absurd when fused with the sphere of politics. Because politicians are liars. That is evident. Disenchanted voters recall a history littered with broken campaign promises. They remember the elder Bush’s infamous illiteracy with respect to his own lips. And they recall not only ignored but impossible promises too, like the 1987 vow from Bob J. L. Hawke, ex-P.M. Down Under, to end Australian child poverty by 1990. (Today, one in seven Australian children lives in poverty; Mr. Hawke has since publicly regretted the promise.) A truism: politicians break their promises.
That pattern, unlike the style of men’s basketball shorts, does not seem to have improved since the late 1980s. According to PolitiFact.com’s “Obameter,” President Barack Obama and the veracity-minded Mr. Biden have met their 506 campaign promises (yes, 506) at a paltry 31 percent clip, with a mere 6-for-25 record on “Top Promises.” Similarly, the corresponding “G.O.P Pledge-O-Meter” lists a 29 percent “Promise Kept” rate for the 2010 Republican class in Congress. Those wavering records seem logical. Politicians, for one, have an incentive to exaggerate, with the intent of wooing potential voters. And on top of that, different constituencies for primary versus general elections can encourage insouciant flip-flopping. But just how malleable, exactly, is a politician’s word?
About one-third malleable, to be precise. At least, that follows the findings of a 1985 book-length study by Jeff Fishel, professor emeritus at American University. In examining U.S. presidents from Kennedy to Reagan, Fishel found a promise-keeping rate of 66 percent, if—importantly—a stymied but real attempt to keep a promise counts as a success. (Other work has confirmed and extended this record, to 70 percent or even three-fourths.) In line with that “A for effort” approach, PolitiFact’s scores for Mr. Obama and the G.O.P. rise to 66 percent and 77 percent, respectively, when “in the works” legislation counts positively. Two-thirds is far from perfect. But, as Rutgers political scientist Gerald M. Pomper points out, compared to America’s one-in-two divorce rate, those scores are “pretty good.”
And, besides, 100 percent may be less than desirable. Mr. Bush’s lip-reading and his successor’s “most ethical administration in history” do not constitute the only reneged presidential assurances. The 1940 Roosevelt campaign promised a refrain from entry into war, a promise wisely revoked after December 7th, a year later. Lincoln promised to preserve slavery in the Southern states, and even endorsed an amendment to accomplish just that (“I have no objection to [such an amendment’s] being made express and irrevocable” —Abraham Lincoln, first inaugural address). That fell away in an 1863 proclamation. Thomas Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans unwound their small-government, Constitutionalist promises long enough to acquire the Louisiana Territory. In 1844, James K. Polk promised a reduced tariff, a resolution of Oregon’s borders, and the annexation of California. And, well, James K. Polk actually delivered on all three. But the most famous James Polk memorial is in Pineville, North Carolina. Not Washington, D.C.
So, we have a few helpful—at least, palliative—lessons. Yes, sometimes politicians break promises. Sometimes they shatter them in a memorable, sharded frenzy. But, more often than not, they do their best—or do something, at a minimum—to follow through on those promises. Despite a world of ephemeral, present-minded concerns, of shifting, archipelagic interest-groups, and of often depthless media flaring, politicians generally stand by their word. And in times when they do not, it may even prove for the better.
The longtime politician Nikita S. Khrushchev (who, perhaps not via promise-keeping, regularly secured a 90 to 100 percent vote for his party) warned, “Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are no rivers.” The latter sentence seems wittily instructive, but the first might not be true. Politicians are not “the same all over.” One glance at the 2012 field, for both parties, shows a wide gamut not just of policy options, but of personalities and of values. A glance at history yields the same. Some politicians are more malleable, more inconsistent. Some are reliable rocks. Many politicians fall somewhere in between. And some, no matter what they promise you, will still roll the Red Army into Hungary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking before a crowd Sunday afternoon at the city of Cambridge’s 37th annual celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds recalled an experience in which she and a professor overcame their differences in pursuit of science.
She was one of six black students working toward an engineering degree at the Georgia Institute of Technology, as well as the first African-American student and the first woman with whom her professor had worked.
“We had absolutely nothing in common, and our first interactions were very, very tentative,” she said. “I didn’t know if I was going to make it through the term.”
But Hammonds persevered, and on Sunday, she said that their mutual passion for their work on laser technology broke down barriers.
“We recognized that the only thing we had in common was that laser,” she said.
Hammonds added later that “over the years, I’ve learned how to find that common ground in every institution that I’ve worked in.”
Hammonds was the keynote speaker at the event, which was held at the Central Square branch of the Cambridge Public Library and included a wreath-laying ceremony commemorating the civil rights activist.
Hammonds’ speech came two weeks after the University announced a donation to the Cambridge Public Library. As part of Harvard’s 375th anniversary celebration, the University said it would give 400 books to the city’s two branches, paralleling John Harvard’s gift to the fledgling college in 1638.
In her speech, Hammonds used her personal experience to explain the importance of overcoming differences through collaborative learning. She lauded King’s message of establishing a “beloved community” based on brotherhood, love, and justice—values that she said she hopes to foster at Harvard.
Hammonds added that Harvard is one of the most diverse communities in the world, forcing students to encounter differences in race, class, and sexual orientation.
“We have to make explicit that we value difference, and we respect it,” Hammonds said, while adding that Harvard also values “the freedom to dissent.”
As an example, Hammonds said that “the student who is an evangelical Christian may have a really hard time accepting an out homosexual student as a roommate or a classmate and vice versa.”
Hammonds said it is the College’s responsibility to teach students “how to respectfully disagree while they learn to think critically about their differences.”
In an interview with The Crimson after her speech, Hammonds cited the Sustained Dialogue program—a year-old initiative that brings together undergraduates to discuss issues such as class, race, religion, gender, and sexuality—as an example of steps the College is taking to foster King’s values at Harvard.
“We believe that students should talk about community, values and differences, and we realize that it’s not so easy to do so,” she said.

Although few students attended the first two events of the Undergraduate Council’s new program “UC Outings,” UC representatives said they hope to further develop the program.
The program aims to create a better sense of community at the College by holding events in the greater Boston area.
Last weekend, the UC sponsored ice skating at Frog Pond and a tour of the Taza Chocolate factory, its first two UC Outings events.
“The UC has been really dedicated to improving social life on campus, and this is a great effort to have Harvard students meet each other, create new experiences, and form new relationships elsewhere in the Boston community,” said UC Cabot House representative Akshay M. Sharma ’14.
The new program was inspired by the “Through the Gates,” a series of trips the Freshman Dean’s Office sponsors to encourage freshmen to explore Boston.
A total of 68 students entered the lottery for the ice-skating event, while the Taza Chocolate factory tour lottery drew 90 students.
UC representatives said that these numbers were larger than expected given the hectic nature of shopping week.
Although ten students won the lottery for each event, only five attended the ice skating event and four toured the Taza Chocolate factory.
Sharma and Jen Q.Y. Zhu ’14, who led the ice skating trip, said that they felt the event was a success.
“It was a beautiful day, the pond was packed, and the Zamboni machine had just been on the ice,” said Sharma.
Nicholas S. S. Pomata ’13 said low attendance did not prevent him from enjoying the afternoon.
“I certainly fell down a few more times than I intended,” he said, “but it was a lot of fun.”
UC representatives attributed low attendance to being in the program’s beginning stage.
“It’s a start, and we’ll definitely keep moving forward,” said UC freshman representative Salena Cui ’15, who led the trip to Taza Chocolate Factory.
UC representatives hope to improve attendance by adding new incentives for invited students to participate in the outings.
Though members of the UC Student Initiatives Committee said that they hope to see the program grow in the coming months, they also said that the success of their new initiative rests on students attending events.
“We want to take it slow so we can really develop a program that’s worthwhile for the students,” said Sharma. “We encourage students to let us know what they want out of UC Outings.”
Possible UC Outings in the future include a paintball event, a visit to Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park, and a trip to Salem during Halloween in the fall.

Wielding cell phones and markers, nearly 70 Harvard students helped to launch on Sunday night the first major on-campus event on behalf of Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s campaign for U.S. Senate.
While the crowd of mostly law students mingled, debated, and made posters, the majority eventually took to the phones on behalf of the candidate who just a few months ago was at the blackboard.
The joint phone bank and information session was organized by “HLS for Elizabeth Warren” and was the first time a student group on campus held a large event on Warren’s behalf.
The roughly 70 volunteers made about 2400 phone calls to residents of Cambridge and Newton, gauging interest and offering information about Warren and her upcoming campaign events.
Warren’s husband, Harvard Law School professor Bruce H. Mann, and a friend, Law School colleague Jody Freeman, spoke briefly to the volunteers about Warren and her goals in between calls.
“This is probably the marquee election in the country,” Freeman told the crowd. “The Senate is a place that often finds itself stuck.... Elizabeth is a person who can really be a game-changer.”
As a nonprofit, the Law School cannot endorse a political candidate or issue, but many law professors have rallied around Warren with moral and financial support, Mann said.
“She’s taught here a long time,” Mann said. “To know that she has the support of her students means a great deal to her.”
That the event should be hosted by Law School students came as little surprise to most students at the event.
The group’s size—roughly 350 members—and its prominence on the Harvard campus points to the unique relationship the Law School has with the woman who was an active professor last semester.
Students in the College have formed their own group in support of Warren, and mainstay Democratic groups on both campuses are likely to endorse her. But the law students in support of Warren have positioned themselves as the leaders on campus, based primarily on their familiarity with the longtime law professor.
“I do know a lot of people who might not support Professor Warren if they didn’t know her,” said Law School student Ben Cluchey, an “HLS for Elizabeth Warren” organizers who had Warren as a professor last fall. “But she commands an enormous amount of respect if you do know her.”
Volunteers said that Warren’s personal appeal among law students is underscored by the universality of her message and her work as an academic and an advocate of the middle class.
“I definitely think [support] crosses party lines. I think part of that is that she’s a professor here, but also just attributable to her,” said Law School student Alyssa Martin, one of the event’s organizers.

Tourists have often commented upon stepping into a Harvard dining hall that they feel like they’ve walked into the magical world of Harry Potter.
On Sunday, the twelve House dining halls and Annenberg evoked less fantasy and more France.
With white tablecloths, fresh flowers, beret-clad dining hall staff, and Parisian tunes rather than the usual Top 40 hits in the servery, Harvard University Dining Services offered a thematic brunch reminiscent of the City of Lights.
The array of special entrées made some students say “ooh la la”: Crepes, baguettes, brie, potatoes au gratin, niçoise salad, and other concoctions rarely seen in Harvard dining halls filled the serveries.
According to Crista Martin, the HUDS spokesperson, HUDS offers one themed brunch at the beginning of each spring semester.
French food was a popular choice in the student survey that HUDS conducted at the end of the fall semester, Martin said, leading to this year’s theme choice.
Though some Houses sent emails inviting students to the special brunch, many students said they were unaware of the French meal in advance and were surprised to find their dining halls specially decorated.
“Sundays are usually bad days since I’m thinking about work, so it’s a nice surprise,” Linda Zhang ’15 said upon walking into Annenberg.
Kenia N. Lucey ’15 agreed: “It brightened me up—Harvard being classy.”
Another freshman, Christina M. Rodriguez ’15, said, “I wasn’t originally going to eat brunch, but my roommates came back ranting and raving about how good lunch was.”
Many pointed to their favorite details.
“The roses are real. That’s a very nice touch,” Tai Boon Ding ’15 said. “I will come for breakfast more if every breakfast is like this.”
Even the food delighted.
“The crepes were wonderful and not too sweet,” Alexander M. Willis ’14 said.
Chanel E. Washington ’15 observed, “The brie is a more pricey food item.”
But while Sabrina M. Castenfelt ’15, who is part French, said she appreciated the efforts of HUDS, she also pointed out inaccuracies in Harvard’s spin on a French bistro, from a sign that spelled “cordon bleu” as “cordon blue” in Annenberg to a Provençal sandwich that was not crisp enough.
“The crepes were really light, pale and like tortillas,” Castenfelt said. “But the mustard in the sandwich Provençal was a nice touch, and the baguettes were good.... There was a great ambiance and it really was a valiant effort.”
Even Annenberg’s youngest diners noticed the difference. Freshman proctor Benjamin L. Castleman and his wife Celia Castleman brought their four-year-old daughter Lila to brunch. According to Celia, Lila observed, “It doesn’t seem like Harvard at all because it’s so fancy.”

In a report released this month, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE)—a Philadelphia-based organization that rates free speech policies at American colleges and universities—gave Harvard a “red light” rating.
FIRE deemed Harvard a “red light” offender for four out of the six policies that it assessed, condemning those policies for “both clearly and substantially restricting freedom of speech.”
FIRE criticized sexual, racial, and religious harassment rules stated in the Handbook for Students, Faculty of Arts and Sciences policies, and a set of free speech guidelines adopted in 1990.
FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal defended Harvard’s commitment to free speech and said Harvard administrators were not bothered by the critical ranking.
“Free speech is a fundamental value of the Harvard community—and the larger academic and educational enterprise—and we therefore take issue with any assertion to the contrary,” Neal wrote in an email.
He added, “We have not reviewed and therefore cannot comment on the material on FIRE’s blog.”
Among the policies which FIRE cited was a line from Harvard’s guidelines which states: “Racial, sexual, and intense personal harassment not only show grave disrespect for the dignity of others, but also prevent rational discourse.... Such grave disrespect for the dignity of others can be punished.”
Another clause that FIRE found objectionable reads: “The determination of what constitutes sexual harassment will vary with the particular circumstances, but it may be described generally as unwanted sexual behavior, such as physical contact or verbal comments, jokes, questions, or suggestions.”
Samantha Harris, FIRE’s director of speech code research, said that such sentences leave students and faculty vulnerable to being penalized for harassment when in fact they were attempting to conduct legitimate academic discussion.
Harris said that Harvard’s codes “mandate” rather than “encourage” respectful behavior.
On its blog, FIRE has recently criticized the kindness pledge which elicited harsh responses when it was posted in Harvard freshman dorms last semester as well as the cancellation of summer school instructor Subramanian Swamy’s courses after he published an inflammatory op-ed.
However, Harris said that FIRE’s “red light” ranking considered only Harvard’s written free speech policies, not its recent actions.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, who was sharply critical of the freshman values pledge in August, wrote in an email that “the free-speech cases that have troubled me lately...had nothing to do with these policies [which FIRE condemns].”
Lewis wrote that he “can’t blame Harvard for writing its regulations in ways that its lawyers believe are necessary to stay compliant with Title IX regulations or other such edicts that govern the affairs of higher education.”
But Harvey A. Silverglate, who is co-founder and chairman of FIRE as well as a 1967 Law School graduate and longtime critic of the University, said that Harvard offers “such a vague and broad definition [of harassment] that it’s actually very easy to be convicted for behavior that would be protected in the real world.”
Silverglate added, “You could say things in Harvard Square that you could be punished for saying in Harvard Yard.”
FIRE’s 2012 report rated 392 colleges and universities, stamping 65 percent of those schools with a “red light” rating and only 14 schools with a positive “green light” score.
FIRE has given Harvard a “red light” for the past five years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council met with members of the College administration Saturday at a Leadership Intensive Program in an effort to improve communication and build deeper relationships between the two groups.
The event, which UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 had been planning since last semester, is part of the UC’s continued effort to increase student voice on campus and give undergraduates a larger stake in the University’s governance.
In the Governance Panel portion of the program, UC representatives spoke directly to heads of the administration including Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson. Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and Secretary of the Faculty Susan L. Lively were also in attendance.
UC representatives said that the event helped establish a good rapport with Harvard’s leaders and taught them how to best use channels of communication to speak on behalf of students at the College.
Bicknell and UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 emphasized bridging the student-administration gap in last semester’s UC elections.
“We’re really trying to find ways to incorporate the students and have them bring up the issues that they’re passionate about,” Bicknell said.
UC freshman representative Ting-Ting H.T. Liu ’15 stressed the importance of strong student-administrator relationships in completing UC projects.
“We now know that the administration is willing to work with us and that we’re all working towards the same goal,” Liu said.
UC Quincy House representative Jen Q.Y. Zhu ’14 said that the meetings were a great opportunity to interact directly with the administrators and to let them know what the UC has done.
“Most students are unaware that both the UC and the administration are open to them,” Zhu said. “They can just email the UC committee chairs and come to a meeting if they want to talk about an issue. Even Dean Hammonds has office hours.”
The Leadership Intensive Program also acted as a kick-off for the Task Force on Student Voice, an initiative started by former UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12.
The Task Force, which will begin in late February, will give students a direct way of offering feedback and suggestions to the administration in order to maximize efficiency and productivity.
“Hopefully, the task force will be the most comprehensive analysis and examination of the decision-making process that the college has ever had,” said Bicknell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As they watched their opponents toss away another pass into the stands Friday evening, the No. 23 Harvard men’s basketball team could have spared the host Bulldogs an ounce of sympathy. Two years ago, the Crimson had found itself in an eerily similar set of circumstances: an upstart team hoping to rely on an Ivy Player of the Year candidate to upset the league favorite.
But just as a youthful Harvard squad did against the 2009-10 edition of the Big Red—which eventually reached the Sweet 16—Yale wilted under the spotlight.
Entering Friday’s contest riding a four-game winning streak, the Bulldogs looked nothing like a team that tied for second in the league’s preseason poll and even received the one first-place vote that did not go to the Crimson.
In falling to Harvard by a score of 65-35, Yale struggled to take care of the ball in front of a vocal sold-out crowd, the school’s first in four seasons. On its opening possession of the night, Bulldogs star center Greg Mangano pulled down an offensive rebound but then lost the ball out of bounds. Yale spent the rest of the half accumulating 13 more turnovers, losing the ball in the post or committing backcourt and traveling violations before heading into intermission down by 11.
Looking confident and composed in the face of a hostile atmosphere, the now-veteran Crimson was the aggressor on defense, pressuring the ball on the perimeter and down low.
“They’re a very solid defensive team,” Mangano said. “I don’t think we were ready for how physical they were going to be. We haven’t seen that much this year. It was eye-opening.”
The Bulldogs’ season-high 22 turnovers led to 26 points for Harvard, which had just 10 giveaways on the night.
BENCH WORK
Though its veteran leadership proved invaluable in battling a raucous road environment, Harvard did not rely on its typical big names in sending the Bulldogs to their first Ivy loss.
The Crimson’s offense struggled in the early going—big men Kyle Casey and Keith Wright combined for two points in the opening half—but found success once Amaker sent in his backups six minutes in.
Rookie Wesley Saunders had all of his four points in seven first-half minutes, taking advantage of his ability to create his own shot off the dribble. His jumper with 11:34 remaining opened up a two-point Harvard lead, which was followed by two straight baskets from classmate Steve Moundou-Missi.
Mondou-Missi, who had 10 points, five rebounds, and three steals in another strong performance off the pine, has gone a total of 18 of 25 from the field in his last four games. Though the starters returned to the floor and hit a pair of three-pointers, it was Moundou-Missi, Saunders, and classmate Corbin Miller who had the Crimson’s final three baskets of the half to open up the squad’s first double-digit advantage of the contest.
Although its reliance on bench scoring was nothing like the previous weekend at Dartmouth—where the Crimson’s reserves outscored its starters by 10 points—15 of Harvard’s 30 first-half points came from non-starters Friday.
“What Tommy has amassed is a group of players where everybody’s equal for the most part,” Yale coach Joe Jones said. “He’s got 10 guys, and probably nine of them are interchangeable in the sense that it doesn’t make a difference who’s in for the most part. With them last year, Keith wright was a main cog, Kyle Casey was a main cog. You could concentrate on those guys, as we did in those games here. When you’ve got a number of different guys that can score on you, it makes it harder.”
MANGY BULLDOG
Much of the Bulldogs’ upset hopes lay on the shoulders of Mangano, who had a team-high 17 points and scored the 1,000th point of his career on a three-pointer with 12:40 left in the first half. The senior, who represented the United States in the World University Games in China in August, became the 24th player in school history to reach the mark. But milestones aside, he was never dominant against the Crimson, which rotated Casey, Wright, and Moundou-Missi on him and generally seemed content to allow him his points and focus its efforts on his teammates.
Mangano, who notched four rebounds and two blocks in 31 minutes, was five of seven from the field in the second half but could not lead a squad-wide comeback after his team went down by 20 midway through the final period. He appeared frustrated with officiating all night, and the inability of his teammates to hold onto the ball could not have helped.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—Predicted to challenge for a spot among the top half of the Ancient Eight after being picked fifth in the preseason media poll and leading the league in scoring offense last year, Brown men’s basketball has so far played a season to forget.
Forward Rafael Maia, a highly touted freshman from Brazil, was ruled ineligible to play in November. A month later, all-Ivy forward Tucker Halpern and freshman guard Joe Sharkey were also sidelined for the entire season due to mononucleosis and a preseason injury, respectively.
Since then, Bears coach Jesse Agel has been at the helm of a squad that lost earlier this month to a Division-III school and boasts a frontcourt rotation consisting of Andrew McCarthy, Dockery Walker, and Tyler Ponticelli, who made a total of 27 starts last season.
So heading into Saturday evening’s game at Brown, the No. 23 Crimson’s big men must have been hungry to take on an undersized and relatively inexperienced frontcourt after battling Yale’s sizeable forwards the night before.
Feast offensively they did, as the Crimson’s trio of co-captain Keith Wright, junior Kyle Casey, and rookie Steve Moundou-Missi totaled 35 points and 29 rebounds. Freshman Jonah Travis added six points in seven minutes off the bench.
In total, Harvard had a 34-20 advantage in points in the paint and outrebounded its hosts, 39-25.
Casey’s 20 points and eight boards represented his best statistical performance since he picked up 26 and 10 in a 74-69 win over Saint Joseph’s on New Year’s Eve.
But the Bears were not pushed completely out of the interior, as McCarthy had seven points on three-of-six shooting in the first half.
“[Our big men] played with basically no rest, and they just battled and battled,” Agel said. “I was really impressed.”
Walker, who went scoreless in the first half, gathered confidence in the early portion of the second period. After a short baseline bucket with 12:41 left, he followed up with a short hook to cut the Harvard advantage to 45-37. A breakaway dunk with five minutes to play meant that Walker finished with 10 points on five-of-five shooting in 34 minutes of play.
“I thought he played very well,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly he had a lot of energy around the basket and did a nice job of finishing.”
CATCH AND SHOOT
Its current roster situation dictates that the Bears take to the perimeter; the portion of their scoring that comes from three-pointers is among the largest in the nation. Saturday’s contest proved to be no exception, as the hosts went eight of 22 beyond the arc, while the Crimson was just two of eight.
“We needed to do a decent job of guarding the three-point line, and I thought we did that.” Amaker said.
Guards Matt Sullivan, Stephen Albrecht, and Sean McGonagill each took at least 10 field goal attempts on the night and totaled 36 points.
A highly-regarded transfer from Toledo, Albrecht hit his first three shots—all three-pointers from far beyond the arc, leaving his defender, Harvard co-captain Oliver McNally, incredulous—but went scoreless in the second half. That was when McGonagill, the reigning unanimous Ivy Rookie of the Year, took over, collecting all 11 of his points.
While Brown reached the free throw line 14 times after halftime, it was unable to take advantage, going 11 of 20 on the night. Walker and McCarthy missed four free throw attempts each, as the Crimson was again helped by its opposition’s struggles at the line. Harvard currently sits at No. 2 in the nation in opponent free-throw percentage.
PUSH TO START
Just as the Bears had a nearly non-existent bench effort Saturday—all five Brown starters reached double-figures, while no other player scored—Harvard began to rely more on its starters against the Bears after a series of games in which its reserves were needed to provide an offensive spark. The Crimson received 13 points on the night from its bench, the fewest since a 70-61 win over Monmouth on Jan. 10.
Along with Casey’s offensive explosion, junior point guard Brandyn Curry had 15 points, tying a season-high. Averaging just four points a game over his past five games, Curry was able to take his defender off the dribble and draw contact, getting to the line nine times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suffering back-to-back narrow losses, the Harvard women’s basketball team never trailed against Brown Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion. Despite a series of late-game scares, the Crimson (9-8, 2-1 Ivy) moved back above .500 with a 65-57 victory.
Harvard flew out of the gates thanks to strong defensive pressure and offensive efficiency. Fifteen minutes into the contest, the Crimson had forced nine turnovers off of five steals and grabbed a 32-13 lead and sophomore Christine Clark had as many points as the entire Bears team.
“We came out in the first half with one of the strongest halves we’ve had in the second half of the season,” said co-captain Brogan Berry, whose team led 34-20 at the break. “Our focus was there; our intensity was there.”
The dynamic of the game changed 30 seconds into the second half when Clark was poked in the eye and forced to sit out the remainder of the match. For a while, the offense continued to click as Harvard extended its lead to 46-30 five minutes into the period.
But the attack stagnated. Over the next 10 minutes, the team mustered only five points while Brown stormed back.
“Clark was huge for us in this kind of a game, so that was an unfortunate loss,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think if we had Clark we would have cleaned up this team.”
Clark’s absence forced the Crimson to rely on Berry and junior Victoria Lippert for extended minutes two days after a tight loss to Yale.
“When you play back to back, you actually lose your legs,” Delaney-Smith said. “The first thing that goes is your threes. We had some great shots, and the fact that we were missing our foul shots was no legs.”
A key to the Bears’ run was strong defensive pressure. Without Clark, Harvard was forced to try to break the press with one fewer strong ball handler.
“Generally people don’t press us because you can’t. We are very good against it,” Delaney-Smith said. “In that particular time, we got very conservative and standstill.”
With 4:30 remaining, Brown sophomore Lauren Clarke capped off a 24-8 Bears’ run with her only made field goal of the night, a deep three-pointer from three feet behind the arc to tie the game at 54. The Bears’ run was fueled by 15 trips to the free-throw line, where Brown knocked down all but one of its attempts.
“The refereeing was good until that stretch where all of the sudden there was banging that they were calling at that end,” Delaney-Smith said. “The same thing was happening at our end, but we weren’t getting the call, and that’s what I didn’t like.”
Berry quickly responded to Clarke’s game-tying triple with a three of her own to put the Crimson back in the lead. After Brown answered with another three, Delaney-Smith’s strategy was limited by the absence of Clark.
After the game, the coach said she wanted to give Berry another open look but wasn’t comfortable with the ball in any other player’s hands to advance it up the court. Lippert stepped up by knocking down a trey of her own.
The back-and-forth offensive game stopped when Clarke missed a three-point attempt after four straight had fallen for the two teams combined. On the ensuing possession, Missy Mullins stepped to the line after being fouled in the paint but couldn’t convert either attempt.
But with less than a minute remaining, Mullins was let off the hook as the Bears failed to capitalize on the opportunity to thin the lead when Clarke missed a layup chance. Berry sealed the win, converting five of six free-throw attempts in the final minute.
“Brogan was huge in the end hitting those free throws to put us back in the lead,” Lippert said. “We were able to step up our defense at the end to get stops and hit our free throws to get the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of back-to-back losses to top-five opponents, the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team (11-2, 2-1 Ivy) looked rejuvenated Saturday afternoon at Barnaby Courts, as the Crimson ended its skid with a commanding, 7-2 upset of No. 4 Rochester.
“It was great to get back to winning ways,” rookie Nick Hopcroft said. “We were coming off of losses to Princeton and Trinity, and those losses really motivated us to come back strong. We showed our bounce-back ability and came back with the best performance of the season.”
The No. 4 Yellowjackets (6-3, 4-0 Liberty League) picked up the first individual match of the day, as Rochester junior Juan Pablo Gaviria topped sophomore Tommy Mullaney in three games at the No. 9 spot, 11-9, 11-9, 11-8. But Harvard rebounded in its other first-cycle matches, with sophomore Nigel Koh and Hopcroft earning wins for the Crimson.
“It’s interesting with squash that you play the individual, [not the team],” co-captain Will Ahmed said. “[Saturday’s] match was a good example of us not letting other people’s matches affect how we play. We saw that against Trinity when we went down, 3-0. Yesterday, everyone was focused on their own match…and that’s what it takes to win.”
Koh, who is also a Crimson business editor, tied it up for Harvard with an impressive showing at the No. 6 spot. Despite dropping his second game by a margin of eight points, the sophomore came back strong to take the match, 3-1.
Hopcroft followed suit, taking down Rochester’s Joe Chapman in four games as well.
Harvard did not relinquish its 2-1 advantage. The Yellowjackets mustered just one more individual victory over the Crimson at the No. 8 spot, as junior Zeke Scherl lost in four games.
“We were very confident going into the match because we’re a strong team, but Rochester is a very, very good team,” Hopcroft said. “They beat us 9-0 last year, and to be able to avenge that was brilliant. Everyone is extremely excited.”
After that, it was all Harvard. The Crimson claimed wins in the top seven spots to seal its first upset of the year.
“[This win] was crucial, the result as much as finding that edge and team chemistry to come together and find a way to have a dominant win,” Ahmed said. “We showed a lot of mental toughness that we were lacking against Trinity, and it’s refreshing to see that back in the program. We had a lot of tough, hard-fought matches went our way, and that speaks volumes to our preparation.”
Sophomore Ali Farag made quick work of Rochester junior Andres Duany—a second-team All American last season—in the fourth match of his college career, taking down his opponent in three games, 11-8, 11-6, 11-3. Farag is currently undefeated at the No. 1 spot for Harvard.
It was the middle of the ladder that provided closest competition on Saturday. At the No. 4 spot, sophomore Gary Power found himself down, 2-1, in games. But the reigning first-team All-American took the fourth in dramatic fashion, 14-12, before securing the final game, 11-7.
“[Coming up with wins in four and five-game matches] is something we’ve been working on from the beginning of the season,” Hopcroft said. “When it gets close, we have to have the mental strength to come through in those games.”
Freshman Tyler Olson and senior Matt Domenick battled to five-game Harvard victories as well. The pair traded games, with Olson taking the first and third and his opponent claiming the second and fourth. But the Harvard rookie earned the win with an 11-6 effort in the final game.
“We have a very young team, but were not going to use that as an excuse,” Hopcroft said. “We’ve been called a talented team, but talent doesn’t win matches. You have to put in the hard work....We’re working on maturing now rather than later, and everyone on the team gels really well.”
Sophomore Brandon McLaughlin won his third straight matchup at the No. 2 spot for Harvard, taking down Rochester senior Benjamin Fischer in four games. And freshman Julian Kirby rounded out the Crimson’s victory, contributing a four-game win of his own at the No. 7 spot.
“It’s a great confidence booster,” Hopcroft said. “We need to keep working hard and moving forward. We can enjoy [the win] for the moment, but we need to make sure we don’t dwell on the past.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In spite of numerous strong individual showings at Saturday’s Armory Invitational, the Harvard track and field team found itself looking up at a pair of familiar foes in the final standings.
The invitational, which was held at the Armory Track and Field Center in New York, N.Y., featured 17 teams, including Harvard’s conference rivals Princeton, Columbia, and Cornell. The Crimson men’s team finished third overall at the meet, scoring 98.5 points, while the women’s squad earned fourth place with 99 points.
Behind a strong outing by their distance runners, the Tigers captured the men’s team title. The Big Red ran away with the women’s competition, outscoring second-place Princeton by 25 points.
“I think our student-athletes performed really well.” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Given the added stress of study card week, I was pleased with how both of our squads competed.”
Harvard’s middle distance runners rose to the occasion on Saturday. Co-captain Meghan Looney won the 800m run, finishing 0.29 seconds ahead of Cornell’s Molly Giantz. Though one second slower than her personal best, the senior’s time of 2:10.02 meets the ECAC championship-qualifying standard for the women’s 800.
“[Looney] led right from the gun,” Saretsky said. “She went out there and pushed the pace. It was great to see such a gutsy performance from her.”
Sophomore middle distance runner Alaina Murphy also turned in an ECAC-qualifying race for the Crimson. Murphy took home first place in the women’s mile run, finishing in 4:53.84. Classmate Morgan Kelly ran a sub-five mile, as well. Her time, 4:58.95, was good for fifth place and four points for Harvard.
In one of the closest races of the day, senior Kailyn Kuzmuk fell to Princeton’s Abby Levene in the women’s 3000m run. Levene edged out Kuzmuk by a tenth of a second to earn the victory in 9:43.61. Kuzmuk’s time bests the ECAC qualifying standard by over 15 seconds.
On the men’s side, the Crimson’s major contributors were the squad’s throwers, jumpers, and pole vaulters.
Junior pole vaulter Nico Weiler won the team’s only individual title, clearing 16’4.75”, five inches higher than the second-place vaulter. Weiler, who holds Harvard’s all-time record in the pole vault, earned 10 points for the Crimson with his ECAC-qualifying mark.
“Nico Weiler is a special athlete,” Saretsky said. “He’s been adjusting to a new coach, and I expect even bigger things from him moving forward.”
The Crimson’s highly-touted freshman class continued to impress on Saturday. Freshman Ben Glauser nearly broke a 43-year old school record at the meet. His mark in the shot put, 59’3.5”, earned him the No. 2 spot in Harvard history in the event. But the impressive mark also only earned him the number No. 2 spot at the invitational. Another freshman, Cornell’s Stephen Mozia, beat Glauser by 5.5 inches to earn the victory.
“I’m pretty happy with how I performed,” Glauser said. “I’m in a good position to do what I want to do in about a month, when Heps and Ivy Championships come around.”
But Mozia will continue to challenge Glauser down the stretch this season.
“It’s going to be a dog fight when it comes to Heps,” Saretsky said.
In spite of his competition with Mozia, Glauser indicated that his overall goal for the season is to throw 19 meters—roughly 62.34 feet—a mark well better than the Harvard record.
“[The record] is a little over 40 years old,” Glauser said. “It’s about time that goes down.”
But his performance in the shot put wasn’t Glauser’s only contribution. He also competed in the weight throw event with sophomore Dustin Brode and junior Matthew Polega. Brode, Glauser, and Polega scored a combined 17 points for Harvard in the event, finishing in second, third, and sixth place, respectively.
Harvard will need to continue to improve down the stretch if it hopes to compete with the likes of Princeton and Cornell.
“Our training is geared toward the end of the season,” Saretsky said. “That’s when we want to be firing on all cylinders. [Princeton and Cornell] have been the perennial powers in our conference for number of years, but I’m happy with the way that we’ve been able to close the gap a bit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team opened its dual match season in winning fashion this weekend at the Harvard Kick Off Invitational, defeating Denver on Friday and besting Drake and DePaul Saturday at the Murr Tennis Center.
The Crimson (3-0) opened the weekend by shutting out Denver (4-1) on Friday, going 2-0 in doubles and 3-0 in singles.
The No. 70 Harvard team continued its winning streak on Saturday, defeating Drake (2-1), 4-1, in the morning and then toppling No. 68 DePaul (5-2), 4-0.
Crimson coach Dave Fish ’72 has a history of winning the season opener in his 34 years of coaching men’s tennis at Harvard. This weekend’s victory against Denver marked Fish’s 30th win in season openers.
Harvard started the invitational with doubles play against the Denver Pioneers, who were playing without their leading scorer, Eneg Bonin, who was recovering from a wrist injury.
But the Pioneers were not the only squad battling injury. Harvard junior Andy Nguyen—who is currently 4-4 in singles play this season—was forced to sit out much of the weekend's action with a sprained ankle he sustained on Wednesday.
“It just couldn’t have been worse timing,” Fish said. “But we sort of taken an attitude like the [New England] Patriots: when one guy goes down you got to have another guy ready to go in there.”
With Crimson players on the mend, some underclassmen had the opportunity to gain court experience.
Freshmen Henry Steer and Alexander Steinroeder moved up in the lineup to take part in doubles play this weekend.
“Steer has been having more and more success in doubles,” Fish said. “He is potentially a very fine doubles player, but, up until this point, he hasn’t had a lot of experience in it.”
The 45th-ranked duo of sophomore Casey MacMaster and co-captain Alistair Felton trumped the Pioneers’ Jens Vorkefeld and Othar Kordschia, 8-4. Senior Jonathan Pearlman and sophomore Christo Schultz added another notch to the doubles score, defeating Denver pair Yannick Weihs and Alex Clinkenbeard, 9-8.
After gaining the doubles point, Harvard swept singles play against the Pioneers. Freshman Shaun Chaudhuri handily defeated Clinkenbeard, 6-2, 6-4.
Steinroeder and Shultz logged two more points for the Crimson, giving Harvard a decisive 4-0 win over Denver.
Later that evening, Harvard continued its run of success in doubles play against Drake.
“I would say that Drake was the strongest team we faced all weekend,” Fish said.
The Bulldogs entered the weekend coming off a prolific outing at the State Farm MVC Individuals, where they earned a total of eight titles.
Despite the strength of the Drake squad, all three of the Crimson double pairings beat their opponents, 8-4, to give Harvard the doubles point.
Facing off in singles action, the Crimson resumed play against the Bulldogs Saturday morning and fell behind early.
“At one point, it looked like [Drake was] going to take five out of six singles [matches],” Fish said.
But despite the slow start, it was Harvard that came out victorious, taking five of the six matches.
The Crimson rounded out the weekend with a third win against DePaul, edging out the Blue Demons in both doubles and single play.
Harvard’s duo of MacCaster and Felton topped DePaul’s Chanturia and Dzanko, 8-4, in the first court, while Steer and Schultz bested Palinic and Chaffee, 8-3, to secure the doubles point for the Crimson.
Harvard then beat the Blue Demons in singles play, gaining its third victory of the weekend.
The Crimson’s campaign was furthered by several strong rookie performances. Both Steinroeder and Chaudhuri went 3-0 in singles play, while Steer logged three singles and two doubles wins and freshman Denis Nguyen notched three doubles and one singles victories.
“It is really great having the freshmen do so well,” Chaudhuri said. “It shows that we are really hungry, and we want to have an impact on the team and steer the team towards an Ivy title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Within minutes of the start of singles play, all six players suiting up for the No. 63 Harvard women’s tennis team were winning their first sets, 1-0.
The scene was representative of what the day brought for the Crimson, which soundly defeated the University of Massachusetts Amherst on Sunday afternoon, 6-1. After sweeping all three doubles contests, five of Harvard’s six singles players won in two sets, giving the Crimson (1-0) its first win of the spring season.
“We knew that all the players [on UMass] were great fighters,” junior co-captain Kristin Norton said. “They came to our Harvard Invitational in the fall, and a couple of us played them and knew they had some strong singles and doubles players.”
Norton and fellow junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana kicked off the day with a doubles win at the No. 1 position, handily beating their opponents, 8-2. Norton and Tachibana, who are ranked No. 25 in the nation in doubles play, were in control throughout the match, going up 6-1. UMass (1-3, 0-1 A10) captured the eighth game, battling back in the tiebreaker to nab the win.
But Norton and Tachibana responded, holding UMass scoreless in the next game before closing out the match in the tenth.
“I think the key thing is our chemistry,” Norton said of her partnership with Tachibana. “We’ve been working really hard together as a doubles team, and we just know where each other is going to be on the court at all times.”
Meanwhile, sophomores Natalie Blosser and Hannah Morrill teamed up and turned in a convincing 8-1 win at the No. 2 spot.
With the first two doubles matches finished, the match at No. 3 carried on. After getting off to a 6-2 start, senior Sam Gridley and junior Camille Jania allowed the Minutewomen to take the next two games, which brought the visitors within two.
But Gridley and Jania were not ready to give the match to their foe. With the scoreboard showing 7-5 overall and 30-30 in the game, the duo rallied until Gridley hit a shot that landed just over the net and spun backwards, moving just out of reach of the UMass returner.
The match ended on an error from the Minutewomen, and the Crimson team swept doubles play.
Harvard rode the momentum into singles play, as each player on the home team claimed its first match.
Norton sped through her match at the No. 2 spot, winning 6-0, 6-1.
On the No. 1 court, Tachibana had a slightly tougher time with UMass sophomore Sonia Bokhari. Despite winning her first set, 6-1, the co-captain saw much closer play in the second.
Bokhari stayed close, relying on long rallies that seemed to tire the athletes on both sides of the net. But Tachibana closed out the match with a number of aces to grab the 7-5 win.
“What helped me a lot was maintaining a positive attitude through it all,” Tachibana said. “It’s really easy to get fazed by your opponent when things aren’t necessarily going your way, and I think at the end there I really just kind of pushed down and battled it out.”
Tachibana’s victory over Bakhari ensured a Harvard victory after Jania finished her opponent, 6-0, 6-2, at the No. 3 position minutes before.
No. 4 Gridley and freshman Sylvia Li, playing at No. 6, also earned a team point each for the Crimson, winning 7-5, 6-2, and 6-3, 6-4, respectively.
“It was a great way to gauge where we are in terms of the overall Northeast,” Tachibana said. “Our entire team played really well...and it’s a great start for better things to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard men’s volleyball team went up against Rivier, the Raiders battled the Crimson squad to a fourth game, nearly matching Harvard in both kills and hitting percentage, before falling, 3-1.
This year, the Crimson (2-0, 0-0 EIVA) only needed three games to take down Rivier (1-1, 1-0 GNAC), sweeping the visitors (25-13, 25-21, 25-21) at the Muldoon Fitness Center on Friday night in Nashua, N.H.
Not only did Harvard end the match with 40 kills—almost double the Raiders’ 25 kills—but the team also boasted a hitting percentage of .463 compared to Rivier’s .049.
“We played really well on Friday,” freshman Caleb Zimmick said. “We were really aggressive with our serving, which paid off a lot. It got the other team on the defensive, and we were really able to take advantage of that. We also passed very well which opened things up for the offense. ”
Sophomore Nick Madden recorded 12 kills and Jones had 11 of his own to lead the Crimson to the shutout victory. White and sophomore Michael Owen also put up solid showings, posting seven and six kills, respectively.
Harvard dominated the opening set, grabbing a convincing 25-13 to start the match.
But led by senior Tajh Stokes, who finished with 10 kills, and junior Steve Visentin, who tallied 24 assists, the Raiders rebounded in the second set, keeping it close until a late run gave the Crimson a 25-21 win.
Harvard closed out the match in the third, winning 3-1.
“Offensively, I really think we dominated this match, and ironed out some of the errors we were committing on Tuesday [against Endicott] to put together a more consistent attack,” junior Rob Lothman said.
On defense, Harvard was led by Gibbons, who posted seven digs, and Lothman, who finished with two digs and two blocked assists.
The freshmen also made their mark defensively, as Zimmick contributed one dig and two blocked assists, and White topped the Crimson squad with three blocked shots.
“Caleb and DJ have both been playing really well,” Jones said. “And DJ actually sparked a really big run for us on Friday by blocking a player on the other team two or three times in a row.…The freshmen work very hard, and it’s great to have them with the team.”
Though Harvard boasts a young squad featuring a combination of four freshmen sophomores in its starting lineup, the squad’s youth has not appeared to be a detriment early on, as the Crimson is off to a 3-0 start.
“The freshmen have done a phenomenal job so far,” Lothman said. “They’re both hitting for very high percentages and coming up with the right kills at the right time, while dealing with injuries at the same time. The sophomores, a year older and a year wiser, are also playing really well, especially considering that some of them are playing different positions from the ones that they played last year.”
“We’ve all been getting along really well,” Zimmick said. “I think everyone is fitting into their roles, and the captains are doing a great job of leading us and keeping us together as a unit.”
The win marks the Crimson’s second straight victory against Rivier and its second consecutive season with a pair of wins to open the year.
“I think it’s really important to start the season with a few wins,” Zimmick said. “We’ve established our confidence now and know that we’re a team that can compete with other teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, Chris Stock was a promising freshman Nordic skier. On Friday, he fulfilled that promise, placing as one of the top skiers in the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association. The sophomore’s fourth-place finish in the men’s classic sprint event highlighted Harvard’s ninth-place finish this past weekend at the University of New Hampshire Carnival.
For both the men and women, the classic sprint event, which took place at Jackson Ski Touring Center, was run in tournament style, beginning with an opening heat in which only the top 36 skiers advanced.
Stock and juniors Alena Tofte and Esther Kennedy of the Crimson women’s Nordic team all placed among the top 36 to advance to the quarterfinals.
That was as far as Tofte would go. The junior tripped on a competitor’s ski and was able to rally to place third in the heat, but only the top two advanced to semis. Tofte would finish 16th in the event.
Kennedy, meanwhile, charged to the semifinals with a strong sprint in the last 200 meters. Kennedy wouldn’t advance to the A final, but her finish in the B final gave her a 12th-place overall finish that marked her strongest collegiate result.
“She did a good job of summer training,” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94. “She’s a very easygoing person outside of skiing, and so it’s kind of fun to see her...competitive fire coming out....It was just exciting to see her keep advancing.”
Stock, meanwhile, was able to fight his way to the A final. The sophomore led the final for the first kilometer but was out-double poled on the final stretch and finished fourth.
“He’s a good sprinter, and we kept talking all day about no expectations, just talking about ‘let’s see how far you can go,’” City said. “He has a knack for it, and he’s in good shape.”
Stock’s finish was the highest any Harvard Nordic male skier has placed since at least 1994, the earliest year in City’s records. Additionally, it was the highest any Nordic skier had placed since the carnival-winning finishes of Anna McLoon ’04.
Stock’s finish led the men’s Nordic team to a seventh-place finish in the event, while the women’s Nordic team took fifth. The women’s finish was the highest of any Crimson squad this weekend.
Tofte led the charge on Saturday, with an 11th-place finish in the 15k free race to help Harvard take sixth as a team in the event. The men’s Nordic team took 11th in Saturday’s 20k free.
While Stock was making Crimson history on Friday, the EISA alpine skiers were taking the day off. Weather conditions forced the cancellation of Friday’s giant slalom event.
“There was too much snow, and there were really unsafe conditions,” alpine coach Tim Mitchell said. “They couldn’t move all of the new snow out of the way so they just double [counted] the results from today so that [the alpine skiers] could have the same number of results as the Nordic skiers did.”
While it was safe to ski on Saturday, the conditions were still affected by the snow that had proved perilous the day before. Because of the snow’s difficulty, Harvard’s skiers were forced to make a choice: Go for speed, or ski conservatively. They all took the first option.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, its daring didn’t pay off.
Captain Caroline McHugh, junior Catherine Sheils, and freshman Liz Strong all hit ruts in the middle of the course that threw them out of synch. But Sheils was able to rally to finish 16th. Meanwhile, for sophomore Rebecca Nadler, who finished 21st, the course may have been too easy.
“She’s a much better skier on hard, difficult hills,” Mitchell said.
But while the results were not what the women’s alpine team wanted, Mitchell was happy with the way they approached the course.
“The girls really attacked,” he said. “They skied really aggressively. You have to take some risks....I’d rather have them skiing fast and making mistakes....It was a calculated risk, and unfortunately it didn’t work out.”
Meanwhile, the men’s alpine skiers were not able to qualify for the second round and thus did not post a result. Mitchell noted that junior captain Andrew Spielvogel was close to qualifying for the second run, and senior Kevin McNamara had a first half of a run that was derailed close to the end.
“He’s getting really, really close,” Mitchell said of McNamara.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
Over the weekend, we revealed the winners of the women's quarterfinals, and we now turn to the seminfinals, where lacrosse’s Jennifer VanderMeulen takes on Melanie Baskind of the soccer and lacrosse teams. We round it out with skier Rebecca Nadler against fencer Alexandra Kiefer.
Mel Baskind vs. Jennifer VanderMeulen
The Baskind-VanderMeulen matchup pits two of the Ivy League’s most fearsome offensive threats against each other. VanderMeulen, who led the Ivy League in scoring on the lacrosse pitch, earned All-Ivy honors for the second straight year.
But the winner of this matchup is VanderMeulen’s captain. Baskind not only led the Ivy League in scoring on the soccer field, she was also All-Ivy in lacrosse.
Winner: Mel Baskind
Alexandra Kiefer vs. Rebecca Nadler
Nadler set out on a unique path for her team in 2011, becoming the program's first NCAA qualifier. Considering only two Ivy League schools were represented, that is an impressive feat in itself. Add her international performances for Canada, and it was a wonderful start to a Harvard career for the sophomore
But Kiefer won an individual national title in addition to other impressive tournament victories throughout her rookie season. Nadler is the best on her team, but Kiefer’s the best in the country. That gives the fencer the edge.
Winner: Alexandra Kiefer

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They are some of the Crimson’s biggest sports fans, yet they don’t even attend Harvard. In fact, they go to one of the Crimson’s cross-town rivals. But the Harvard Hoochies—a group of self-proclaimed “BU biddies, hooching and husband hunting at Harvard Final Clubs” known for their presence on campus and on Twitter—stay on top of Crimson athletics.
We caught up with the Hoochies via email to hear their thoughts on all things Harvard sports. Check out their unedited responses below to find out what they have to say about Harvard’s female athletes, Crimson basketball, Harvard’s uniforms, and much more.
The Harvard Crimson: Which is your favorite Harvard sports team and why?
Harvard Hoochies: We don’t discriminate. If he’s a Harvard athlete, he’s sexual meat by default.
THC: Who is your favorite Harvard athlete and why?
HH: Here are a few by club:
The Delphic: J.T. Tomes - Harvard Baseball - Most genuine guy at Harvard
The Fly: Andrew Fulham - Squash Team - Straight out of a Vineyard Vines ad
The Fly: Max Campion - Golf Team - Also straight out of a Vineyard Vines ad
The Owl: Dan DiMaria - Harvard Lacrosse - Stereotypical bro who loves himself and has great hair. What more could you want?
The Owl: Ryan Cutter - Harvard Swimming - 1 word: Speedo
The Fox: Austin Taylor – Harvard Football - Complete gentleman, not to mention he’s active on Twitter
The Spee: Devin Saxon - Harvard Football - Why? Because he’s a man-god, that’s why
THC: What is the hottest position in sports?
HH: Dirty question. Wrestling gets pretty steamy…but those tight spandex pants the Football players wear are nice to stare at no matter what the position.
THC: How much time do you spend on gocrimson.com looking at the rosters to find your future husband?
HH: Let’s just say that gocrimson.com comes up in the URL bar before Google. Not sorry.
THC: What is your take on female athletes at Harvard? Do you feel threatened by them at all?
HH: We can’t believe you’re even asking this question.
THC: Do you have any favorite Harvard women's teams or athletes?
HH: Stop it.

Harvard Football
Love the tight uniforms
Came through at Harvard-Yale yet again

THC: What were your thoughts on the Harvard-BU men's basketball game in December?
HH: We went to support our team (as in Harvard). We knew we’d win. At the end of the day there’s no real comparison between the 2 teams.
THC: If you could make any changes to the Harvard basketball uniforms, what would they be?
HH: Have their Twitter handles on the back of each player’s jersey. That whole team is on Twitter. But if it was truly up to us, they wouldn’t be wearing anything at all…
THC: On a scale of golfers to football players, where do sportswriters fit in?
HH: I mean if you go to Harvard and are in a final club, who cares whether or not you play a sport?
THC: Which teams would you like to see more of?
HH: Harvard Crew, Harvard Hockey (AD?), Harvard Wrestling

New York Times correspondent Jodi Kantor left Harvard Law School to pursue a career in journalism, but this Tuesday evening she returns to Cambridge to discuss and sign copies of her recently released book, "The Obamas," at an event hosted by the Harvard Book Store.
"Even though I left Harvard, I keep circling back to it," Kantor said.
"The Obamas," according to Kantor, is unique in that it focuses on the president and the first lady equally, as well as on their relationship. "The book brings people deep inside the White House. It's a discussion of how the White House can be a strange place to make a living," she said. The book considers themes such as the effects power can have and the pressures of being a role model.
The release of "The Obamas" was a controversial one—the White House issued an official statement in early January calling the book an "over-dramatization of old news."
Harvard Law School professor John G. Palfrey '94 will moderate tomorrow's discussion. The event begins at 7 p.m. and is not ticketed, although space is limited. Guests are welcome to bring their own copy of the book or purchase one at the Harvard Book Store for Kantor to sign.
