In the age of Instagram and Facetune, “Dollface” is trying to reach the pinnacle of female solidarity. Hulu, along with executive producer Margot Robbie, brings the modern American woman a show that speaks to the importance of female friendships. But for a show all about women, the amount of stereotyping that spills into sexism is disappointing, if not regressive.
The show follows a traditional 21st century sit-com set-up: The protagonist, Jules (Kat Dennings), has just been dumped by her boyfriend of five years, Jeremy (Connor Hines), and now has to find her own place in the world. Her process of finding herself focuses on one thing: reforming her female friendships.
In the pilot, “Dollface” suffers from a case of “tell, don’t show,” where the audience is drilled with exposition about how long Jules and Jeremy have been together and how much they’ve been through as a couple. It’s hard to immediately develop empathy for Jules for losing a relationship, given that the audience sees none of it. To make matters worse, Jeremy appears to be nothing more than a jerk, such that it is difficult for the audience to mourn with Jules for the loss of the relationship.
What does set this show apart from others is its unique, surrealist elements of storytelling. The show exaggerates many features of the female experience into indulgent metaphors. In the first episode, for example, immediately after being dumped by her boyfriend, Jules boards a bus driven by a “Cat Lady” (Beth Grant), who becomes her spiritual guide throughout the rest of the season. The bus is full of crying women who have all also just been similarly dumped. Cat Lady tells Jules that she has to reconnect with her female friends and that if she doesn’t she may end up like a “guy’s girl.” The bus then passes a group of women in football jerseys yelling fractional “manly phrases” like “Who wants to chug a beer?” or “Does anyone wanna get wings?” And therein lies the issue with this show: It propagates the idea that men and women are entirely different species that can only get along when in romantic relationships.
While not every conversation in “Dollface” centers around men, they all do center around how women should act. Jules’ friends Madison (Brenda Song), Stella (Shay Mitchell), and Izzy (Esther Povitsky) spend much of the show trying to educate Jules about how the modern woman should behave in all elements of life. While there are clear character differences between the three friends, they all subscribe to the same stereotypes of modern womanhood. Even their habits are the same: they all use Instagram religiously, they love parties, and they’re passive aggressive in arguments.
Jules is supposed to be the “relatable” character for the audience, but in every episode she is told she has to be more like her other friends. According to “Dollface,” there are only a few select personalities women are allowed to have, and the same goes for men. The undeniable presentation of “Dollface” is that straight men and straight women should be apart except in relationships, a view that is an unrealistic depiction of modern society and also inherently sexist and old-fashioned.
However, the show does make some witty jokes at the expense of this concept of modern womanhood. Jules works at a company called “Woom,” a clear play on Gwyneth Paltrow’s “lifestyle” company “Goop” for women with too much money and time on their hands. The show jokes about women having to go to the bathroom together or being superficially nice all while Jules rolls her eyes. But in the show’s world, Jules is still the outsider because she behaves the opposite way of what she’s told to live, and what is most disappointing is that she seems to agree.
The show’s stylistic choices are actually well-thought out, and may be acknowledging the skewed gender dynamic. The show creates a ‘50s aesthetic in its font, title music, and eventually Jules’ new home, which is complete with an entirely pink tiled retro bathroom. Kat Dennings’ casting is also very well thought-out. While she does do a surprisingly good job at playing the ‘relatable girl,’ she is also the closest thing Hollywood has to a living pin-up model, particularly with the styling in the show. She has pale skin, jet-black hair that is styled into soft curls, and bright red lipstick and intense winged eyeliner. Even the title “Dollface” is a play on a mid-century catcalling term that Jules’ ex used for her. So while the show acknowledges the gender roles it is trying to break, it imposes its own as well.
It’s clear that Jules should’ve maintained friendships while in a long-term relationship. As she says to Jeremy in the first episode, “We’ve hung out together like every day for half a decade. I don’t really know what to do now,” it’s important to value relationships outside of romantic partners so you don’t lose yourself as an individual. But the means she takes to “find herself” cause her to desire to be a stereotype of a modern woman. While the show is a lot of fun, packed with some genuinely good performances and stylistic choices, it exaggerates a rift between the sexes and perpetuates gender stereotyping — the exact opposite of what a show like this should do.

K is woken hours later by a cursing F, crashing into the bureau on his way to the bathroom. He raises a finger to his lips and mouths the word quiet. He urinates loudly and — she is listening — does not wash his hands. He stumbles out of the bathroom — his belt is unbuckled and his trousers are around his ankles — and toward her.
You’re here, F says. K turns on her side and does not respond. I’ve never been happier to see you, he says. She sees his hand slowly stroke her cheek in the bureau mirror. He kneels to the floor and waits by her side. I knew you wouldn’t do it, he says. She sees him lean closer to place his lips on her cheek. We’re fine, babe, we always have been. He runs his hands through her hair. Trust me. She turns to face him and says, How can I? He does not respond. She asks again. How can I? He does not respond.
K sees F kiss her cheek, her nose, her forehead, her lips, pushing the question back into her mouth. He turns her back on her side. She catches the reflection of his tongue in motion. She feels another wet kiss on her skin. He spreads her wings apart. She pushes him away. Breathing heavily, he bends down to whisper in her ear, But I love you, and continues.
K searches the mirror for strength, but the weight of the world and all its discontents pin her down. F is too heavy to peel off. She is still. Behind him, she can see the reflected moon, the wide and languorous shores of darkness surrounding it, broken only by pinpricks of diffused light. What she sees — solitary glimmerings in the distance — are stars still in the past. In the millions of miles between them and her, time has aged, transformed from past to present. She learned this in high school. She is looking into the night of before. What might the stars see tonight, sitting there at the back of time?
The stars could still be looking down upon the world decades ago, on a night when K sat at home, only a child with her head in her mother’s lap. On a night when the room fills with the sound of a small television, a movie that her mother likes. The images are grainy, the colors are bright and gaudy, and spread outward in a cone of light. The television remote is encased in tattered plastic. All the room’s lights have been dimmed and outside, thunderous rain falls in fast, oblique sheets. Her head is heavy with drowsiness and she drifts in and out of sleep. She feels the rise and fall of her mother’s breath, rolling gently forward like waves.
K’s eyes suddenly flutter open sometime later. Her mother has covered her in a thin blanket — dark purple with a silky magenta border. She turns her head to look at her and, is it the glow of the television? the grace with which her face is at ease with itself?, feels love. You are so beautiful! she thinks. I want to be you. I want to keep you from the rest of the world. She does not say anything. Her mother, as if to tell her that she knows, strokes her hair and puts a playful palm across K’s eyes.
F finishes within minutes; he falls to the side and, though his grunts hang fixedly in the sky above the fishing village for days, is snoring within seconds. K does not sleep that night.
The next day, the couple spends the afternoon at the beach. F plays volleyball with teenagers from a nearby college. K sits on a towel and stares out at the sea: Its glimmerings reveal nothing of the deep world below, only dance mindlessly beneath the sunlight. Waves run after their white-frothed crests and crash against the sand; they turn in circles like chariot wheels. Along the beach, children build sandcastles and chase and flee the tide, and families picnic on the sand, away from the salty spray of the sea. The whole world performs their roles for her to see. She watches them, but from a distance, as if from behind a mirror.
On the horizon, K sees a ship, a beehive, sailing away from the mainland. It is golden beneath the sun, with a mast and sails sewn from threads of sweet honey, lighter than air. Even from a distance, she can tell that the bees aboard do not waste time with words; each breath, each sidelong glance at another sailor is a look of pure meaning. Some are reeling in the anchor to gain speed, some are sweeping the deck and rigging the sails. And though the sun shines brightly down, there is not a shadow in sight. Nothing obscures the light. The bees beat with one heart and are set in motion to the song of their own fluttering wings, which hugs the sails and pushes the ship forward, forward.
K remembers reading a book by Zora Neale Hurston in high school, which opens, “Ships at a distance have every man’s wish on board.” She can feel the absence of wishing, of wanting — of thinking wants possible — in her soul. She wonders, nervously, when exactly they boarded a ship and left for brighter ports. She wonders if she can catch the tail end of a passing wind and reach the ship before it is on the open and endless sea. She wonders if she is out there, somewhere, waiting to be found again.
K hawks back some saliva with great performance and spits it as far as she can. She loses sight of where it goes. Maybe it carries part of her off, floating along currents of air to that honeycombed ship in the distance; maybe it lands on the volleyball that F spikes across the net.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine you’re alone in one of those liminal, reality-meets-reverie spaces after a certain hour of the night — think IHOP, Denny’s, or any other 24/7 fast-food establishment with eerie fluorescent lighting — when a voice behind you utters two fateful words:
“Vibe check!”
Your heart skips a beat as you freeze, bracing for what’s to come: either a friendly emotional check-in or a vicious blow to the head. The catch? You have no idea which. What gives?
Such is the Schrödinger-esque reality of life in a world where “vibe check,” the Lernaean Hydra of 21st century vernacular, has developed more shades of meaning than there are hues of healing crystals, essential oils, and other purported recipes for good vibes. From compassionate to violent to purely bizarre, the phrase’s dizzying array of connotations merits analysis. Put simply, “vibe check” needs its vibes checked.
Urban Dictionary’s original 2011 definition of “vibe check,” though gently critical of bohemian pseudoscience, is innocuous enough: “A process by which a group or individual obtains a subjective assessment of the mental and emotional state of another person, place or thing. Not anchored in or limited to science, psychology or sociology. Grounded in a belief in pachouli [sic], sage, or karma and sometimes veggie burgers.”
Over eight years later, a viral Tumblr comic redefined the process in question, depicting one stick figure yelling “vibe check!” to another before whacking its companion over the head with a baseball bat. The post garnered over 30,000 notes and inspired a bevy of spinoffs linking “vibe check” to scenes of violence from (simulated) medieval warfare, Greek mythology, and famous assassinations, to name a few.
This recent interpretation of “vibe check” marks an undeniable shift from selflessness to self-interest. A term born out of genuine care for loved ones’ emotional well-being has evolved to represent an unsettling endorsement of physical aggression as a way to eliminate bad vibes.
Given society’s current political and social polarization, negative feelings are hard to escape. It’s no wonder people are all too eager to get rid of them by embracing a tool unique to our generation: social media. But is resorting to violence, if only in memes, the best solution? Will the proliferation of ironic “vibe check” images ultimately generate more bad vibes, trapping us in a hellish feedback loop of vibe checks?
On the other hand, it’s also possible to view the phrase not literally but as a metaphor for catharsis and empowerment. A figurative “vibe check” enables its proponents to concretize their fears in the form of a meme and vanquish them with a single swing of a baseball bat. Instead of silently enduring an onslaught of bad vibes, people are taking matters into their own hands.
ShindanMaker, which describes itself as “a site to post fun fortune-telling tests,” offers a test titled, simply, “Vibe Check.” After a user enters their name, the website displays the text “Vibe check passed” along with randomly generated values from zero to 10 for six traits: “Soft,” “Baby,” “Cursed,” “Feral,” “Clown,” and “Gremlin.” (Ah, yes, the six fundamental components of the human personality.) Despite — or because of — its nonsensical outcome, over a million people have taken the test. The masses seeking meaning in their results’ complete lack thereof have reached the pinnacle of surrealist escapism.
Maybe it’s best to treat the conflicting definitions of “vibe check” like yin and yang: opposing principles that coexist in harmony. So why not get the best of both? Extend love and empathy to those near your heart, but don’t hesitate to forcefully banish any negative thoughts that are getting you down. And, of course, enjoy the ensuing good vibes.

Remember My Chemical Romance? Is your go-to holiday jam their cover of “All I Want for Christmas Is You”? Does the faintest echo of a high G on the piano activate a primal urge to belt the lyrics to “Welcome to the Black Parade”? Did you once consider frontman Gerard Way’s flaming red hair the height of fashion? Do you like D&D, Audrey Hepburn, Fangoria, Harry Houdini, and croquet? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, you may be entitled to compensation for the emotional distress their 2013 breakup inevitably caused you.
Many MCR enthusiasts will find solace in the upcoming ninth anniversary of the release of “Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys,” the band’s final studio album. After the success of their 2006 rock opera “The Black Parade,” Way and his bandmates swapped their trademark marching band uniforms for futuristic motorbikes and neon ray guns. Their sound also changed as they channeled the dramatic flamboyance of their early days into focused, energetic bursts of power pop.
This anniversary’s significance lies in the album’s rich lore: Like its predecessor, “Danger Days” adheres to an intricate narrative. Its 15 tracks tell the story of four renegades — the titular “Killjoys,” portrayed by the band members in the accompanying music videos — who use art to oppose an authoritarian government in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland with the help of a mysterious orphan known as the “Girl.” The setting of their imagined dystopia? California, 2019.
With the year of “Danger Days” finally upon us, the anniversary of its release invites comparison between its reality and ours. The album’s promotional materials, including simulated propaganda posters and news broadcasts, reveal state-enforced conformity and global warming as the causes of the Killjoys’ rebellion and their dismal surroundings. Although government agents in vampire masks aren’t chasing musicians through pools of acid rain (yet), the uncanny similarities to our 2019 are hard to miss. Inequality and discrimination persist, fueled by those who view our differences as a danger to their tenuous hold on power. Climate change threatens to destroy the world that has sustained life for millennia. Dogmatism and ignorance call truth itself into question.
And, just like their “Danger Days” counterparts, artists continue to confront these injustices in their work. The album opens with a fictional radio announcement by underground DJ Dr. Death Defying, who urges his listeners to “do it now and do it loud!” over a spirited guitar riff that leads into the first single, “Na Na Na.” The accompanying music video depicts the Killjoys’ life on the run from their enemies, literal corporate warriors in sleek tailored suits and mind-controlling masks. The Killjoys hurtle through the California desert at breakneck speed in a decked-out Trans Am, reveling in stolen weapons, salvaged cans of dog food, and — most importantly — music. As the Killjoys prepare for a decisive confrontation, the Girl holds up a stereo. Even though the encounter ends in the Killjoys’ defeat and the Girl’s capture, the lyrics’ menacing defiance shows that the fight is far from over: “Make no apology / It’s death or victory / On my authority.”
The Killjoys’ story continues in “SING,” a brazen anthem to music’s potential as an agent of rebellion. Over swirling synths and propulsive percussion, Way embarks on an impassioned diatribe against “Cleaned-up corporation progress,” asking his audience to “raise your voice / Every single time they try and shut your mouth.” In the video for “SING,” the Killjoys meet their end while trying to smuggle the Girl to safety. In the wake of her protectors’ deaths, the Girl escapes determined to carry on their legacy, representing the inexhaustible endurance of art.
“Danger Days”’s political undertones, though prominent, coexist alongside moments of extraordinary tenderness and nostalgia. My Chemical Romance never let listeners forget that the Killjoys’ fight for social upheaval stemmed from love, not spite. Unlike the dreamy sentimentality of most pop ballads, a sense of urgency hovers over the album’s love songs. “Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you,” Way sings on “Bulletproof Heart,” an uptempo track that grows out of an unassuming keyboard motif into an arena-worthy cry for freedom. “Run away like it was yesterday,” he urges in the chorus. “Summertime,” whose ingenuously simple guitar intro elicits surprising melancholy, also explores the concept of love as a motive for escape. “How long until we find our way / In the dark and out of harm?” Way asks. “You can run away with me anytime you want.” On “The Only Hope for Me Is You,” he marvels at love’s ability to inspire courage in the face of adversity, while “The Kids from Yesterday” is a wistful reflection on youth.
Most of all, the Killjoys never let their revolutionary fervor get in the way of having fun. The spoken Japanese intro to “Party Poison” summarizes their carpe-diem mindset: “Life is short / And there are many dangers on the road we travel / So let’s dance!” Whether or not you plan on dancing, the unbridled energy of the album’s faster tracks — “Party Poison,” “Na Na Na,” and “Planetary (GO!)” among them — will have you on your feet in no time.
As 2019 draws to a close, it’s time to make sure that our future is better than the Killjoys’ present. It’s time to follow their lead and harness art as a weapon against evil. In the words of Dr. Death Defying, it’s time to do it now and do it loud. Killjoys, make some noise.

On Nov. 14, Lowell House hosted an event with Waad al-Kateab and Edward Watts, the directors of “For Sama,” which won L'Œil d'or, the Best Documentary award, at the Cannes Film Festival this year. Hamza al-Kateab, Waad’s husband and protagonist in the film, was also in attendance. The film has won no fewer than 20 different awards across several film festivals around the world, including the SXSW 2019 Film Festival and the Nantucket Film Festival, and has given worldwide attention to the ongoing Syrian crisis. A Q&A session followed the screening of the snippet of the film. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Waad al-Kateab and Edward Watts to discuss their experience producing their documentary about the ongoing Syrian crisis through the five years Waad and Hamza spent living in Aleppo.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you start filming? What was the first thing you filmed in Aleppo?
Waad al-Kateab: So, in 2011 when the revolution started, I joined the protests. And it was so easy in Syria to distinguish with which side you want to be because there were normal people protesting, and there was the regime trying to make these people not ask for their human rights. So, it was so obvious that what we needed to do is to record and film these things because the regime was denying everything that was happening on the state media. Like when we were in one protest, you could see the security forces coming, beating people in the street, and killing them sometimes. And then you see the official camera of the state media coming and filming [as if to say,] “Oh, there's nothing happening here. All the videos you've seen were fake.” I started with my mobile phone, as many other activists in the university, and with time, things became bigger and bigger. Every time, there was more violence. We felt that we needed to go through to the background of these things and why they happened. Like, beyond everybody you see. There's family, memories, people, life. You need to capture the full perspective.
THC: When did it come to you mind that this footage could become a film?
WAK: It's never come to my mind! Really, for the full five years — I was just capturing as much as I could. I've worked sometimes in the news, sometimes in small, short documentaries, and all the time we were trying to do our best in very specific symbol things. I couldn't see the full picture when I was inside. So, I was just capturing, and I was pretty sure that — not just me, I think everyone who lived in those circumstances — we were feeling that we could be killed at any moment. We've never planned something for the future. Everything we were trying to do was just for today, maximum tomorrow, but nothing more. I was just like, capture this material every day put it in one hard drive, and just try to continue. If I could have sent three minutes for one of the news programs around the world, that would be amazing. But I never thought, “Oh, I want to do a film about five years, or three years, or whatever.”
Hamza al-Kateab: I think the best thing — and I’ve been, as a doctor there, filmed by several films or long reports news — and it doesn't feel real when there's a script. Like when the cameraman came with the script like, “I want you doctor to walk in the corridor. I want to check the patient. I want you to do this.” What was great about what Waad has done is that she filmed everything and then [tried] to build a story. There is no script written [demanding], “I want a child crying with his mother or something,” but when they wanted to build the story it was like, “Oh, do we have a shot of this? Do we have a clip of that? Do you want to tell another family story?"
EW: I think that is so true. And that's one of the things that makes it so real and authentic. And one of the incredible things about working with Waad was that because she wasn’t necessarily thinking “Okay, this scene is going to go here and this is going to go there,” she filmed so much. You know, so all of this richness of their lives, and of the story of what happened in Syria was gathered together. So, you know, so much of it was there, and there were so many options that we had to bring out different aspects of humanity.
THC: Two types of footage exist in the documentary, journalistic recordings of the conditions and personal videos. For example, you include videos of your daughter and videos of your wedding. How did you feel about merging those two kinds of footage?
WAK: In many places when I start filming, I was like, “Okay, I'm now here, Waad who’s trying to be a filmmaker [strictly] to document.” But in some places, I felt that the camera became part of my life and my body. For example, in the poster itself, there is me, Sama, and the camera. I felt like these three elements changed the whole of my perspectives. And so far, I still see everything as a frame. It was all the time like I was trying to live my life normally as Waad, the mother of Sama, sometimes just the wife, sometimes just the young woman. And then trying to capture these amazing minutes in my life. Which means, for me, that if I couldn't really survive, this is will be protected and no one can deny this. But at the same time, I was trying to be Waad, the journalist, trying to capture real stories. And when we were trying to do the film, it was so obvious that to give people the full perspective, it needed to be a mix between Waad the journalist and Waad the mom. That's what we try to reflect in the film.
THC: When did you start putting these different clips together? When did it become the film?
WAK: So, when the film finishes, the last thing is when we left Aleppo. So, after I left, I was filming the whole five years. I was working in 2016 at Channel Four News in the UK. They have a program every day, and I was sending them some small stories which worked for the news. Because I have a good relationship with them, I went to the UK in February 2017 — it was just one or two months after we left Aleppo. And we were speaking more about doing longer news reports. Then I showed them some of the material that I have — I’ve done with them around 25 reports. We put them all in one website called “Inside Aleppo,” like a series of news reports — so at that time when we felt that this could be a very big project, they introduced me to Edward who worked with them before. I couldn't do the story by myself. I was just left so emotional. I don't have the good experience to do that big project alone.
EW: You know, people — because of the scale of Waad's archive and what they lived through — I think everyone was thinking, “This feels like it should be a bigger piece.” That was one of the reasons they called me. But no one knew what it would be. Would it be on TV? You know, how long would it be? But I think we certainly felt from minute one — I definitely did — that it should be a piece of cinema, that it should be a long film because — just the stuff she captured and what she lived through — it felt that that was the appropriate platform, that it should be as long a film as possible to tell the story properly.
THC: Now that you have been able to share your film with the world, what’s next?
WAK: So, for the situation itself: This is still happening now. And I'm so happy to be a filmmaker and to do more films. But for me, I’m here just because of what I went through, because of a cause which I truly believe in. So I will try in my personal future — and with the experience that I have now, and with lots of good things which I'm now getting — to continue to do more stuff about Syria, because there are thousands of hundreds of stories to be told. The film itself now is doing very well around the world. So, what we are trying to do is to use it as a tool to shed light on what's happening in Syria right now. The impact campaign we're trying to do, which is “Action for Sama,” is focusing on the situation right now in Syria, about the attacks on hospitals and health facilities, which is happening a lot now. So, we work with many partners located in the U.S. and in the U.K. — one of them is Physicians for Human Rights. So, I think I still feel that there's a lot of work to do — all the details of what's happening in Syria, for accountability, for justice.
Lowell House is planning to have a full screening of “For Sama” before the end of this semester so that students can watch the documentary in its entirety.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The currents of change in all its forms were palpable everywhere three decades ago, sweeping the globe on a massive scale. Politically, the thirst for revolution reached its peak. The Tiananmen Square democracy protests captured the world’s attention. The Communist regimes in Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Hungary dissolved, and the end was just months away for regimes in Poland and the other Soviet bloc countries. On Nov. 9, the Berlin Wall came down, leading the way to German reunification. Away from the world of revolution, Japanese emperor Hirohito died, as did the Ayatollah Khomeini, leader and founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
But change was not limited to political spheres. The first commercial internet service providers, for example, launched in 1989. And the arts, of course, were not oblivious to the times. In fact, they took on a central role as symbols of, responses to, or celebrations of the moment. Today, they are monuments to their time. Now, 30 years later, there are just a few examples that reflect this year of change:
“Goddess of Democracy”
On May 30, 1989, a group of 15 art students unveiled their 33-foot styrofoam and plaster creation to the massive crowd of protesters at Tiananmen Square and to the watching world. They dubbed the statue “Goddess of Democracy.” Her stance radiated dignity and confidence: eyes fixed straight ahead, head held high, both hands holding her torch aloft, one foot striding forward. Her placement, too, added to her grandeur. The goddess stood directly in the middle of monstrous Tiananmen Square, standing face to face with the colossal portrait of Mao Zedong, who hovered over the square as the embodiment of everything the protesters sought to end. She closely resembled the Statue of Liberty and yet was distinctly her own. Within her lay the zeitgeist of the moment, and so it is solemnly fitting that she met the same end as the protestors she represented. On June 4, just days after the statue’s unveiling, the Chinese military violently put an end to the protests. Amid the death and destruction lay the fragmented remains of the goddess, crushed by a tank like so many others –– a symbol, now as it was then, of Tiananmen’s hope and despair.
“Ode to Freedom”
On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day of 1989, the legendary Leonard Bernstein conducted two concerts, one in West Germany and the other in East Germany, to celebrate the holiday season with an extraordinary amount to celebrate. The concerts centered around one great work of German art: Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Bernstein made one major change, though. In the final movement of the Symphony is the famous “Ode to Joy,” set to Friderich Schiller’s poem of the same name. Bernstein, however, substituted “joy” (“Freude”) with “freedom” (“Freiheit”). The result, behind Bernstein’s practiced baton and an orchestra that included members from both sides of Germany and indeed across the world, is soaring and triumphant. Bernstein’s masterful rendering, the orchestra’s skillful execution, and the overall atmosphere elevated Beethoven’s symphony into a symbol — an ode, indeed, to the joy and freedom of the moment.
“Looking for Freedom”
American actor-singer David Hasselhoff found himself more than a star in Germany in 1989. The reason? His song “Looking for Freedom,” released as a single in 1988. The uptempo song, characteristic of the decade’s pop, is about a young man on a long and continuous search for freedom. “I’ve been looking for freedom / still it can’t be found,” Hasselhoff sings.
It was a theme that resonated with restless and frustrated Germans –– the song held the top spot on the West German charts for two months in the summer of 1989. And as the wall was on its way down on New Year’s Eve 1989, Hasselhoff was at the Brandenburg Gate in decidedly American rock star fashion, belting his hit song atop a crane platform for an adoring and jubilant crowd. His song, with its simple message, had come to represent the moment for Germans –– first their anxious longing for change, then their euphoria at having achieved it.
Posters for the Revolution
Art also reflected the historical moment in subtler, but just as significant ways. There is perhaps no better example than the posters artists created to support the revolutionary movements in Soviet bloc countries. The posters are incredible examples of using art and design to communicate to an audience. They are stark, sometimes shocking; they are sometimes metaphorical; they all are rendered with carefully chosen colors and bold contrasts. One famous poster by Tomasz Sarnecki encouraged people to vote in Poland’s 1989 legislative elections. Gary Cooper, in character for “High Noon,” strides forward behind the logo of Poland’s pro-democracy party Solidarność, ballot (rather than pistol) in hand. Posters like these were visible reminders that called on people to sustain and grow the movements they had fostered. They stand now as relics to the spirit of that moment.

When most people think of opera, they think of pieces like “La Traviata” or “Carmen,” written hundreds of years ago and performed in another language. This is just one of the reasons “Fellow Travelers” — an American love story between two gay government employees in the 1950s, is such a bold new experience, entrenched in McCarthyism and the Lavender Scare. Gregory Spears’ opera “Fellow Travelers,” based on the eponymous novel by Thomas Mallon, premiered in the U.S. with the Boston Lyric Opera, from Nov. 13 to 17. In the story, Timothy Laughlin (Jesse Darden), a young man beginning his career on the Hill, initiates a passionate love affair with an official in the State Department, Hawkins Fuller (Jesse Blumberg), while Senator McCarthy (David McFerrin) tries to identify and expel gay and lesbian government employees.
Effectively utilizing the DC backdrop, the opera deftly weaves fact and fiction, personifying the suspicion and mayhem of that political era through a deeply compelling love story. The Lavender Scare, in parallel with the more broadly known Red Scare, rooted out gay and lesbian people with the presumption that “sexual deviants” would be more susceptible to bribery and corruption from outside forces. In a contemporary moment similarly marked by unrest around gay rights and the suspicion of foreign influence, the story feels incredibly relevant. That said, the opera does assume a certain degree of familiarity with figures and events from the time, constantly referencing Roy Cohn, McCarthy’s attorney, Senate consultant David Schine, and McCarthy’s conflict with the army. This backdrop may not be widely accessible, particularly to younger audiences.
The romance at the heart of the opera is, for the most part, gripping and heartbreaking. Laughlin and Fuller have a connection from their first chance encounter, but as their relationship unfolds they’re persistently plagued by Laughlin’s struggle with his faith, the imperative of keeping their relationship a secret, and the knowledge that they can’t have a real future together. Both characters are deeply flawed, making the heartbreak unfold realistically. Yet, the relationship is also based on a slightly uncomfortable power imbalance, in which it seems that Hawk holds the reins the whole time. From their first encounter, Hawk makes fun of Timothy for drinking milk, calling him a “growing boy.” Later Hawk also helps Timothy get a job, and when he pursues Timothy and guesses he’s the first man the younger man has been with, claims that he now owns him. The relationship and the hurdles it confronts are complicated enough by the myriad environmental factors around then, but Hawk’s dominating role and repeated instances of emotionally hurting Timothy can range from frustrating to unsettling, even if they’re realistic. Still, the audience finds itself desperately rooting for the two until it becomes obvious that their relationship only brings pain to both of them.
In terms of the music, each member of the cast delivers an incredible vocal performance. Blumberg and Dardens’ voices blend together wonderfully, and several members of the supporting cast including Vincent Turregano and Michelle Trainor are real scene stealers. Overall, the non-stop score successfully captures the show’s overt and repressed emotions. However, there are some conversations and lines for which the opera treatment feels slightly odd, particularly mundane, relatively emotionless phrases delivered with passionate singing or repeated several times. In some scenes, the combination of characters and the lines they’re singing at once on stage are also curious — for instance, it’s unclear why a supporting character Mary sings on stage in a different setting yet simultaneous moment as a critical encounter between the two main characters. The experience of constant music also brings to mind the critical emotional potential in silence, letting the aftermath and consequences of a moment speak for themselves. That said, the operatic music seamlessly combines with the modern dialogue, and lyrics provided on the screen help the audience follow along easily.
“Fellow Travelers” also shines in its set design and staging. The stage is framed by an arc of six marble columns, reflecting both DC’s monuments and a sense of the enclosure the social setting imposes. From the opening scene, a tree branch’s shadow across the whole stage captivates and sets the stage beautifully. Each different scene has several different pieces and unique decorations, efficiently distinguishing each space and the emotions within it. Reflective of the production as a whole, the design is carefully-thought out, complex, and communicates its message with warmth and depth.

“The White Man’s Guide to the White Male Writers of the Western Canon” delivers just about exactly what one would expect. Of course, the target audience isn’t exactly “the white man,” but then, you probably could’ve guessed as much from the title as well. Dana Schwartz’s humorous introduction to prominent white male writers, inspired by her twitter account @GuyInYourMFA, briefly glimpses at the lives and seminal works of many literary greats while peppering in drink recipes and questionable life advice for the aspiring (white male) author of the next great American novel.
The main dilemma this book presents is what to do with it. With no hint of narrative, the book leans heavily on its distinctive, ironic voice throughout, but it’s unclear why readers would read straight through more than 30 brief rundowns of featured members of the Western canon. While little known fun facts about these authors and their often ridiculous lives are interesting, the descriptions of their work are often too short to get a meaningful understanding of their importance to actually “navigate every dinner party you attend...with grace and aplomb.” They’re more effective as inside jokes for people who’ve already read them. And, going quickly from one writer to another, it’s unlikely you’ll actually remember much without really trying. Perhaps the book will be a blessing to cheeky academic quiz team competitors or will serve as a self-indulgent quick break for MFA students in between literary classics, but the book isn’t particularly well suited for anyone genuinely seeking education on the canon, as the bulk of the jokes are meant for those already entrenched in the world of lit mags and fiction workshops.
The humor in “The White Man’s Guide” ranges from successful parody to mockery to excessive bitterness. Schwartz seeks to critique the stereotype of an elitist, privileged young white man horrifyingly confident in his own literary genius, a character that’s easy enough to imagine if not necessarily someone we can all think of in real life. The humor works best when it calls out the absurdity of this culture, these authors, and their texts, like “Byron died at thirty-six in battle because the alternative was turning thirty-seven, which is basically dying anyway”  and “Even though he was technically born in Canada like some sort of weak-minded doughnut-eating idiot, Saul Bellows is still one of America’s most important writers.” Yet, other jokes are more on the nose (and occasionally a tad cringe-inducing), striking the reader as too obvious and exaggerated, such as, “my prose poem titled ‘Yes I Am White, But I Still Understand Racism Better Than Anyone Else,’” which ultimately produces a somewhat inconsistent tone experience.
The book continuously highlights the pervasive role of sexism in literature, yet it’s unclear to what effect. As the bios unfold, the trend of famous authors using, abandoning, and mistreating women is blatantly obvious; the number of the literary greats who preyed on women half their age is also stunning. Yet, the book hardly implies this should distract from the work these authors produced (although those too are often critiqued for their portrayal of women). The book’s whole premise critiques the amplification of white male voices in “the Western canon” and a tendency to disregard works by and for women. The introduction explains this premise by stating “[white men] are the most widely read, the most celebrated, the most influential, and, if I’m going to be blunt, the most talented.” The phrasing is clearly callous and somewhat ironic, but save for “the most talented,” those attributes are hard to refute. Besides perhaps Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters, most people would be hard pressed to name “classic” female authors, while Shakespeare, Dickens, Hemingway, and Fitzgerald (or at least several of their works) are household names.
Ultimately, a book highlighting the lives, successes, and most influential works of white male authors only broadens their exposure, celebration, and impact, and while readers walk away feeling the gaping lack of women in the collection, they don’t get any exposure to new female writers either. With chuckle-inducing, if not hilarious, writing, Schwartz presents an unextraordinary but entertaining experience. Thus, “The White Man’s Guide to the White Male Writers of the Western Canon” can provide a quick, fascinating read for a literary geek or anyone curious to learn more about this supposed world of MFAs and black coffee, but it tends to fall short in its more ambitious goals in criticism.

Carmen Maria Machado depicts the complexity and surreptitious truth of the abuse of queer women through the mosaic portraiture of her own past self in her memoir “In the Dream House.” Machado, the author of the short story collection “Her Body and Other Parties” and a finalist for the National Book Award, employs original methods of storytelling and teaching in her latest work, recounting her past through a string of vignettes all written within the confines of various narrative tropes, such as haunted house or choose your own adventure. These vignettes, read on their own, range from masterfully crafted, poetic lines of introspection to descriptions of Machado’s past relationship with abuse.
By chronicling her own experience with abuse, Machado informs the history, or lack thereof, in literature about abuse in queer relationships. The point isn’t to document the history of the abusers and the abused, as Machado points out, “The abused woman has been certainly been around as long as human beings have been capable of psychological manipulation and interpersonal violence.” Machado keeps returning to this central idea within the memoir: Stories of abused women have been silenced, and even more so, the stories of abused queer women have barely had a chance to be told.
Machado’s fragmentation of her own story into many storytelling archetypes seems ambitious and unexpected for a book centered around such a serious topic. Ripping apart and piecing together the narrative actually reflects how Machado was feeling during her time “at the Dream House,” a phrase Machado uses to reference the times she was in her abusive relationship. She explains that during her time in the “Dream House,” she began to experiment with fragmentation in her writing: “Every narrative you write is smashed into pieces and shoved into a constraint,” she writes. This memoir has been split into dozens of different anecdotal stories told through many tones and styles, rather than focusing on on one linear narrative. Machado, employing this fragmentation, was able to portray simply through form how her ordeal in the “Dream House,” disrupted the way she thought. The stories, however, are not quite as fragmented as she describes. In fact, the stories blend together with beautiful synergy, completely separate in motive and form, but strung together narratively and emotionally.
Machado vacillates between first person and second person perspectives. These alterations are not at random: Clearly the two beings, the “I” of her present and the “you” of her past, are distinctly different characters in the narrative arc as a whole. One is within the circular devastation of the “Dream House,” and the other is finally outside of it reflecting back on the pained and suffering girl that is, for the purpose of the story, wholly different from Machado’s present self. This use of “you” even subconsciously, places the reader into Machado’s perspective in the "Dream House.”
There is a chapter entitled “‘Dream House’ as Choose Your Own Adventure®” where Machado places the choice of action on the reader. There are places in this chapter that the reader can’t reach by following the adventure set out by Machado, and they read like a variation of this: “You flipped here because you’re sick of the cycle. You wanted to get out. You’re smarter than me.” And toward the end of the chapter, the choices start narrowing down to one page, where the cycle of the adventure begins again, repeating until the reader is forced to read pages they shouldn’t read to break the cycle that Machado was trapped in. Somehow, Machado was able to use structure and form to convey a message that doesn’t translate without the experience itself. The idea that stories of abuse are circular and seemingly unending doesn’t necessarily attach to the reader until they are making the choices and they get lost in this loop themselves. Machado masterfully plays with structure to convey wordless emotions that carry much more weight than can be merely described.
Machado slips between the voices of numerous narrative tropes so effortlessly, conveying an overall tone of dissonance that, done poorly, could have been misinterpreted as incoherent but is actually artistically masterful. Machado is able to resuscitate the buried history of abuse in queer relationships with a mix of her own story and the stories of past battered queer women whose stories were suppressed, untold, or trapped in a faraway "Dream House.”

It is at once overwhelming, heart-wrenching, and empowering. It is the feeling of being thrown into battle and of transcending the status quo of climate inaction. It is the crescendo of humanity itself. The piece ends on an alarming note: There is a world to save and it is up to you to save it. That was what I first felt when I heard COPUS’s performance of “What If We…?” — a jazz-spoken word hybrid composed by the ClimateMusic Project based on climate data — at the WorldBank’s Art of Resilience exhibition last October. This work does not stand alone; rather, it complements a growing number of pieces composed from interpretations of the sounds of rising sea levels and soaring temperatures. In this way, music provides an innovative medium to bridge the conventional communication gap between the public and the often inaccessible world of research science. By turning science into symphony, they convey the statistics behind the stark reality of climate change with an evocative and uniquely human experience to galvanize climate action.
“What if We…?” is one among many pieces produced by the ClimateMusic Project founded by San Francisco-based artist Stephan Crawford, which aims to “harness this universal language [of music] to tell the urgent story of climate change to broad and diverse audiences in a way that resonates, educates, and motivates.” The works implore listeners to imagine the potential for a transformed future, a what-if scenario in which we achieve a more sustainable system. At other times, they strike a more somber tone, suggesting a what-if scenario in which the intransigence to serious climate action seen today persists, dooming us to a planet of depleted natural wonders and destroyed communities. They do so through overlaying techno beats and instrumental blends with audio snippets of startling facts about the stark reality of climate change.
This correspondence between the music’s tonality and the Earth’s condition also manifests in the concepts of other climate-data-inspired composers. Szymon Weiss and Szymon Sutor’s composition “The Lost Seasons,” first performed at the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change COP24 in December 2018, inteprets climate research data through a discordant blend of instrumental and technical sounds. It represents how Antonio Vivaldi’s “The Four Seasons” would change if composed today, amid the climate crisis. Such reconceptualization conveys a sense of radical intergenerational change — an alarming disharmony and urgency in 21st-century life. Meanwhile, the composition of seismologist Lucy Jones’ piece “In the Name of a Warming Earth,” performed earlier this year in Los Angeles, reflects changing surface temperatures, while its fuller blend of softer high notes with intense chords cultivates a sense of wonder in its audience. It invites nostalgia for the world before the intensifying effects of climate change, gently prompting listeners to mobilize against further sorrow.
As they turn science into symphony, these composers are united by the fundamentally and radically experimental nature of their projects. Though science is critical to understanding the urgency of the climate crisis, scientists often face criticism for struggling to communicate their findings in publicly accessible terms. Yet music creates a shared tongue between listeners of diverse levels of scientific understanding — a language of ecological loss and common struggle in the face of the climate crisis. Mixing sound media creates an overwhelming sense of immersion for both the scientific artists and their listeners in their one dying world, with their unity representing a promise for its salvation. In this way, climate-data-driven pieces not only strike a deep chord with their audience to sound the alarm about climate change, but inspire their audience to sound the alarm themselves.
As the climate crisis accelerates, this science-to-sound movement may play an increasingly valuable role: Music can offer scientists, vital authorities on climate change, a new pathway for public expression. It creates harmony in place of the former discordance between academia and the sphere beyond it. As compositions like “What if We…?” become more common, scientists are not only transcending this divide, but carving out an entirely new role for themselves as climate artists and activists to catapult their unique understanding of the stark reality of climate change into public consciousness. The question that remains is which what-if scenario the public will pursue.
— Contributing writer Ilana Cohen’s '22 column, “Expressions of the Climate Emergency,” is a nonfiction column that discusses artistic response and resistance to the climate crisis.

Unrelentingly sweet but surprisingly therapeutic, director Marielle Heller’s “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” transcends the genre norms that have defined uplifting, awards-friendly biopics for decades. Heller’s Thanksgiving drama is a remedial experience that thrives on cathartic character development, witty dialogue from a well-written script, and a memorable supporting performance from the ever-affable Tom Hanks.
“A Beautiful Day” follows cynical Esquire journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), who’s tasked with interviewing famed children’s television personality Fred Rogers (Tom Hanks). Lloyd's interactions with Mr. Rogers eventually lead him to embark on his own journey to forgive his estranged father (Chris Cooper) and reconcile with his wife Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson) and their newborn son.
Hanks’ Fred Rogers isn’t given as much screen time as one might expect (considering his prominence in the film’s promotional material), but Hanks gives a fittingly scene-stealing performance that flourishes in its subtleties. From Rogers’ careful voice to his aloof mannerisms, Hanks embodies the same impossible patience and steadfast understanding that made Rogers such an iconic role model for generations of children.
It’s easy to be cynical about “A Beautiful Day” — at first glance, its mere premise is a cheap exercise of the trite messages “kindness is all you need” and “tolerance will make the world a better place” that have assaulted theater screens and unfortunate moviegoers since the dawn of cinema. If one has so much as watched a movie, they would be capable of unearthing the film's plot within its first few minutes. For a film so steeped in genre norms, "A Beautiful Day" could have seemed as if all of these misdoings so endemic to the genre were rolled into one, but Heller makes her film about the process of healing rather than healing itself.
“A Beautiful Day” achieves its candid and transparent tone by inviting audiences to project themselves onto Lloyd. In doing so, Heller banks on some simple but indisputable truths: Everyone has regrets, everyone has felt pain, and everyone has, at some point, opted to bury such emotions to forget their pain. As Mr. Rogers begins to coax these feelings from the ever-suspicious Lloyd, the film does the same with its audience, granting viewers a thoroughly interactive experience. "A Beautiful Day" is never about watching two characters converse — it's about putting audiences in a position to heal themselves. Such audience identification marks a significant difference between passive sympathy, which has burdened similar films into feeling detached and insincere (including last year's otherwise well-polished "Green Book") and active empathy, which Heller fully evokes in her film. At times, this approach can feel blunt (when characters say what they're feeling), and at others disarmingly subtle, but it works so seamlessly that "A Beautiful Day" never feels forced or contrived.
Unfortunately, "A Beautiful Day" occasionally suffers from technical issues. The film shifts aspect ratios from the 4:3 grainy television scenes of Mr. Rogers' television show, to the high definition 1.85:1 theatrical format for its main narrative. This is a smart artistic choice in framing the film's plot — the whole story unfolds as Mr. Rogers tells Lloyd's story on his show. However, the film has problems with its aspect ratios even in its main timeline scenes (especially in the wedding scene that takes place in the opening sequence). These shifts aren't anywhere nearly as drastic as 4:3 to 1.85:1 (and could simply be an issue with the early print of the film), but they distract audiences from the experience at a time when they need to be hooked.
“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” manages to be a poignant celebration of Fred Rogers’ life, even if it doesn’t plot out his life story. Some fans might be disappointed that more isn't said about Rogers, who's often shrouded in mystery — one recurring question (which only goes partially answered) is how he can hold himself together when he gives so much hope and patience to everyone else despite his personal tribulations behind the scenes. However, that's not what Heller tries to accomplish; she underscores the importance of Rogers' indelible legacy as a man who sought to build sustainable emotional foundations for millions of youths. That bubbling inspiration is contagious.

“Meanwhile, in existential hell, I was facing the tyranny of a blank page,” narrates Jughead’s (Cole Sprouse) disembodied voice at the beginning of the episode. It seems likely that at some point in time the writers of “Riverdale” felt the same way, because this episode — like the past few — have brought very little to the table. At this point, “Riverdale” is a weird re-hashing of problems from previous seasons, with the added benefit of Jughead’s prep school experience and Archie’s (KJ Apa) ongoing battle with street thug Dodger (Juan Riedinger).
“Andrews, you asked us to be big brothers, not soldiers in a turf war,” Reggie (Charles Melton) yells at Archie, mad that he’s brought the football team into this dangerous back-and-forth with Dodger. As the episode unfolds, it becomes clear that the turf war is between Archie’s community center and Dodger’s Wipeout Arcade, and Dodger wins by giving kids free pizza and arcade coins. So not only are children joining a drug ring for free pizza, but Sheriff Jones (Skeet Ulrich) is also just now putting the dangerous part of town, where this ring runs its operations, on his route. This show can’t decide whether Riverdale is a cushy suburbia or a crime-ridden urban center.
To top it all off, Archie asks Hiram Lodge (Mark Consuelos) for help, which seems like a deep breach of trust. After all, Archie’s long-time girlfriend Veronica (Camila Mendes) is currently in an all-out war against her father and his crimes. It’s doubtful that Veronica would be happy to find out her boyfriend is asking her dad to commit… more crimes. This lack of communication probably has something to do with the fact that Archie and Veronica have had the bare minimum number of scenes together. Sometimes, it’s easy to forget the two are even dating.
In a general sense, the Lodge storyline is getting tired. “Speaking of secrets and lies, how many more secret children should we be expecting?” Veronica asks, and honestly, I’m wondering the same thing: Julian Blossom who died in the womb, Charles (Wyatt Nash) who is the half brother of both Betty (Lili Reinhart) and Jughead, and now, Veronica’s secret half-sister Hermosa (Mishel Prada). The secret sibling reveal has been done so many times on this show, it’s honestly shocking that the writers have decided to do it again, especially considering that the reveal does nothing but start a feud between Veronica and Hermosa as they fight over who is Hiram’s favorite daughter.
Usually “Riverdale” tries its best to have at least one unsolicited sex scene between teenagers, but this episode was an exception. This time, Hermione (Marisol Nichols) and Hiram have a steamy moment in a super problematic way. It involves references to murder, a slap in the face, and Hiram’s weird line: “Some couples, they tie each other up to spice things up, but you and me, we order hits.” Somehow, reminding Hermione that they’ve hired people to kill the other is hot, and they start making out.
Betty’s storyline is just a regurgitation of past seasons. She visits Chic (Hart Denton) in jail and accuses Charles of being sneaky. We’re reminded that Chic and Charles used to be together. There’s definitely something shady going on, because then Chic calls the police about the weird murder Betty and her mom committed back in the day. At the end of the episode, even though Betty has exonerated Charles from her suspicions, Charles is seen visiting Chic and calling him “babe.”
But the two weirdest things that happen in this episode are Cheryl’s (Madeline Petsch) continued insistence on keeping her brother’s corpse in the chapel, and Jughead’s conspiracy theory that his grandfather is the real author of the first book of the infamous Baxter Brother’s series, not Mr. Dupont (Malcolm Stewart). Cheryl’s plotline speaks for itself, except now there is a sentient doll that apparently represents the triplet, Julian, she ate in the womb. Cheryl tells Toni (Vanessa Morgan), “I had the most horrible phantasmagoria” (because Cheryl talks like a robot), and for whatever reason Toni hasn’t run for her life at this point. Cheryl’s extended family arrives and tries to convince her to sell the family business and house. When she refuses, they threaten to take away Cheryl’s power of attorney by proving she’s mentally unstable. While her family handles the situation poorly, they might have a point. She does have a many years’ old corpse hidden in her house.
Stonewall Prep has truly gone off the rails. Jughead has his conspiracy theory, and along with Betty and some help from the Riverdale High archives, it turns out to be true. When Jughead brings it up to the original author of the series, Mr. Dupont, the guy absolutely loses his mind and threatens to get Jughead expelled. This only makes Dupont seem more guilty, but honestly, what was Jughead expecting to happen after he accused him of plagiarism? Then, Jughead tells his teacher, Mr. Chipping (Sam Witwer), who agrees to help him bring the truth to light. Then the next day in class, Mr. Chipping starts to talk and then hurls himself out of the stained-glass window. At first, this seems like a nightmare sequence, but it becomes clear that viewers are meant to believe that Mr. Chipping actually jumped. And guess who’s the new teacher? Mr. Dupont!

29 years ago, a menacing theme droned in the background as the POV of some unknown “force” swept its way across a sprawling lake into the mountains of Colorado, setting its sights on a small, yellow Volkswagen Beetle, the occupants of which were heading towards certain doom. And with that scene, thousands of audience members in the ‘80s were introduced to Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining,” which quickly cemented its reputation as one of the best films the horror genre has to offer. Now, in 2019, writer-director Mike Flanagan has stepped in to take his shot at “Doctor Sleep,” Stephen King’s sequel to “The Shining.” With an impressive résumé of past projects behind him (“Oculus,” “Ouija: Origin of Evil,” and “The Haunting of Hill House”), hopes were high that Flanagan would be able to do “Doctor Sleep” justice. And he does not disappoint. Though the film suffers from a hefty length, some failings, and a heavy reliance on Kubrick’s original film, “Doctor Sleep” is a worthy addition to the King filmic canon and it succeeds in repairing many of the mistakes made by its predecessor.
Decades after surviving an attack by his crazed father at the Overlook Hotel, Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is haunted by the literal and metaphorical ghosts of his childhood. Struggling to subvert the violent, alcoholic nature that he has acquired from his father, Dan settles down in a small New Hampshire town while simultaneously burying his “magic” abilities which he has long called “the shining.” Yet his life is thrown back into chaos when he meets Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran), a teenager with extraordinarily powerful “shine” abilities, and learns of the True Knot, a cult of quasi-immortal beings who feed on Steam, a life-giving energy produced by torturing those who can “shine.” When the True Knot sets its sights on Abra, Dan must face his childhood ghosts to protect Abra from the evil that is coming her way.
Yes, that sounds absolutely ridiculous. However, the film takes itself very seriously and somehow manages to make this outlandish plot work surprisingly well. The True Knot is a terrifying force to be reckoned with, and the film makes it very clear how dangerous the members can be. While the prospect of harvesting Steam sounds silly in a quick summary, it is no laughing matter on the screen, and Flanagan makes that abundantly clear with one of the most disturbing scenes put to film in many years. The disturbing villains hold the plot together and create an atmosphere that oozes with suspense. Somehow, the stellar writing and acting make the ludicrous and scattered plot believable and engrossing.
On that same note, the narrative is bolstered by strong performances. McGregor does a great job shedding light on Dan Torrance’s demons and turning him into a believably flawed hero. The subtleties in his acting, from the kindness of a smile to the horror of a loss, are what make his portrayal so gripping. Rebecca Ferguson, who plays Rose the Hat, the leader of the True Knot, along with the actors who play the cult members, do a remarkable job of showcasing the terror that these characters inspire. Even those characters with little screen time give incredible performances. Alex Essoe plays Shelley Duvall playing Wendy Torrance, and gets everything right, down to the cadence of her voice. Jacob Tremblay, who plays Bradley Trevor, is only in the film for a short time, but his performance resonates with the viewer long after the credits roll.
“Doctor Sleep” also goes to great lengths to succeed where its predecessor failed. Though “The Shining” has secured its spot as a key staple of the horror genre, there are those (including Stephen King himself) who have been especially critical of the liberties taken on the original work. Additionally, Kubrick’s misogynistic attitudes towards actresses he has worked with, especially Shelley Duvall, have been condemned. “Doctor Sleep” manages to subvert and rectify many of these missteps. “Doctor Sleep” is, at its core, a film built on strong female characters and their performances. Though Dan Torrance can be considered the primary protagonist, it is the showdown between Abra Stone and Rose the Hat that takes center stage throughout most of the film. Furthermore, as “Doctor Sleep” is a direct sequel to “The Shining,” Flanagan is forced to accept and build on the narrative decisions made by Kubrick. That being said, “Doctor Sleep” adheres much more closely to King’s source material and rectifies the deviations in the original work wherever it can. Fans of the books will likely be happy with Flanagan’s creative direction and ultimate loyalty to King’s work.
However, while the film succeeds in differentiating itself from “The Shining,” it is hindered by its repetitive use of callbacks to Kubrick’s film. While some of these callbacks are used to great effect and should make fans happy, others are overused to the point of exhaustion. The first time the bathtub woman from Room 237 appeared was a horrifying and welcome surprise. The fifth time, not so much. Additionally, a lot of moments in the final act of the film play out more like fan tribute scenes than productive narrative development — they detract from the brilliance that came before.
Additionally, the movie drags on for too long. Once the conflict begins to develop and the wheels start turning, the movie moves along at a fairly brisk pace that does a good job of maintaining tension. However, it takes a while for the narrative to gain that momentum, and the beginning drags. Some scenes in the middle could also have used some trimming. There is a particularly lengthy segment that, ultimately, retreads topics that the film has already adequately covered and does not have nearly enough of an effect on the plot to warrant the time allocated to it.
Perhaps most critically, despite Flanagan’s strong writing and mesmerizing character performances, there are times where the façade comes down and it becomes readily apparent just how ridiculous parts of the narrative are. Though these moments are few and are often quickly remedied, they provide just enough of a peek behind the curtain for the suspension of belief to falter and for one to say, “Okay, that’s a bit of a stretch.”
Overall, there can be no denying that Flanagan has created a worthy successor to “The Shining.” Though the film suffers from a fair amount of overreliance on Kubrick’s film and several other notable pitfalls, it is another worthy entry in the library of Stephen King films.

Some people are natural car DJs. They identify the mood and skillfully ignore complaints from the backseats. Others, myself included, know the feeling of calling shotgun and immediately regretting it when the aux cord is handed to them. They are the nervous aux cord holders. With this playlist, there’s no more need to turn around and ask, “What is everyone feeling?” anymore.
“Walking On A Dream” by Empire of the Sun
This song is appropriate for any occasion. Riding in an Uber on your way to make bad decisions? Windows down, sunny day, appreciating life? This song is your hype man, your sunshine, or anything you want it to be.
“Kids” by MGMT
This is a classic car tune to prove your DJ skills. Everyone knows the build up to this song. The recognizable melody and banging drums will get everyone in the car to sing along to the only part they know “buh duh duh duh dadadadahdahhhhh dah.”
“Higher Love” by Kygo, Whitney Houston 
Whitney Houston is the woman to cure your aux cord anxiety. Everyone loves Whitney, and Kygo is a true artist. A slow muted beginning that crescendos into full vocals and a strong beat is a sure way to inspire flailing dance moves and stretched vocals trying to reach Whitney’s range.
“Little Talks” by Of Monsters and Men
This song is great fun with other people, even if it’s just you and your Uber driver, because it has two singing parts. It’s inclusive and interactive — your friends can’t complain if they’re singing along!
“Liquid Spirit - Claptone Remix” by Gregory Porter, Claptone
I would have never thought that Gregory Porter’s voice could do anything other than lull me to sleep, but in this remix, his sweet honey vocals are paired with a delicious beat that makes you want to stay up all night rolling to this song.
“Quarter Past Midnight” by Bastille 
A fairly new song from Bastille’s latest album “Doom Days,” this tune is perfect for an uber full of anxious night owls with lyrics like “It’s a quarter past midnight / And the speakers are blowing” and “we keep on running / Running through a red light / Like we’re trying to burn the night away.” Not everyone will be able to sing along, but who cares!
“Shotgun (The Wild Remix)” by George Ezra, The Wild
George Ezra’s “Shotgun” is a banger by itself, but this remix will guarantee some nods of approval and claustrophobic car dance moves when the beat drops.
“Alright” by Supergrass
This is a classic feel good, eyes closed, hand outside the window, sun on face, youthful song. No one really knows the words that our British friends Supergrass are saying, but all you need to know is “we are young” and “feel alright”.
“Riptide - FlicFlac Edit” by Vance Joy
There is a sure way to get groans from the passengers in a car: play overplayed songs. Riptide is definitely one of those songs, so I suggest you spice it up with a remix. This FlicFlac edit transforms this classic ukulele song into a work of art filled with drops, Vance Joy’s isolated vocals, and thumping beats.

I can’t remember seeing a bad Disney movie in the past several years. To some extent, they get some slack for being kids movies; “The Good Dinosaur,” “Big Hero 6,” and “Wreck-It Ralph” might not have been spectacular, but no one could seriously hate on them. As for the rest (think “Zootopia,” “Tangled,” “Moana,” “Coco”), they are almost universally loved, not only by kids. Whatever goes on at Disney Animation Studios seems to be working, because “Frozen 2” is yet another indomitable, enjoyable powerhouse of an animated movie, and joins the canon of Disney classics — and in some ways, redefines it.
We all knew this was coming. After “Frozen” (2013) won two Academy Awards; earned $1.26 billion in box office revenue; and spawned countless theme park rides TV adaptations, and a Broadway musical, the only real question was why the sequel took so long to make. The sequel picks up three years after the original left off, but not much has changed for the gang — Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) rule happily over the kingdom of Arendelle, Olaf (Josh Gad) pops in for a joke now and then, and Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) navigates a particularly dicey marriage proposal. One day, Elsa begins hearing sounds (four of them, to be exact, that form a convenient leitmotif for the songwriters) and, in her attempts to find their origin, the gang dives into a mystical enchanted forest — home of elemental spirits, feuding tribes, and a surprising number of waterfalls — where they try to figure out how all this magic stuff works.
To be fair, the magic is pretty confusing. Yes, Elsa can freeze things and make astonishingly intricate dresses, but she can also summon ice memories, quell spirits, and enter glittery dream sequences. The movie never really explains how it works, but, honestly, it doesn’t matter, because it’s absolutely gorgeous. The animation is unparalleled — realistic when it needs to be (rain scenes that probably exist just for Disney to show off its photorealistic water droplets) and equally beautiful when it isn’t (take the forests and glaciers and castles with vibrant color palettes, which have been designed with the signature Disney creative flair). The songs make wonderful use of this animated form, with flairs and accents that, when overlayed with the music, create dazzling, energized sequences that just wouldn’t be possible in live action.
The music is exactly what you’d expect — another polished, catchy set of Disney standards. There’s no “Let It Go”-level frontrunner, but there are plenty of opportunities for Menzel to show off her vocal range, as well as another bouncy existential exploration for Olaf, a surprisingly dark (the line “Hello darkness / I’m ready to succumb” ends the first verse) solo for Anna, and — the true gem of the soundtrack — a hilariously self-aware 1980s power ballad for Kristoff. Kristen Anderson-Lopez (“Frozen,” “Coco”) and Robert Lopez (in addition, “Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”) reprise their roles as co-songwriters, and their knack for writing catchy melodies seems to have carried over to this film, along with some of the motifs from “Frozen.” The piano intro from “Do You Wanna Build A Snowman,” the opening “Vuelie” theme, as well as the four-note siren call expertly tie together the songs and score, creating a sonic cohesion that isn’t achieved in most movies, let alone children’s movies.
As amazing as the music and animation are (a standard that Disney almost always meets), what truly distinguishes “Frozen 2” is its story. If “Frozen” is the movie equivalent of the Tower of Terror ride (a few shake-ups here and there, probably a big drop at the end, but generally predictable), the sequel is Space Mountain (long patches of smooth coasting and huge, sudden suspense-building drops). There are colossal action set pieces where Elsa goes full Iron Man with her energy beams, along with incredibly solemn, tender moments. There are moments of glaring self-awareness (Olaf, in a game of charades, fully turns into Mickey Mouse) and humor, but there are also moments that fully indulge in spirits and magics and physics-defying grandeur. There’s no villain, not even one disguised as a love interest, and there isn’t a concrete, linear plot. That isn’t to say that good won’t triumph, that love and sisterhood won’t prevail. There are, however, plenty of moments of suspense, where even adult viewers can revel in some open-ended mystery.
And, in some ways, that’s the key to the appeal of the film (and Disney, in general) — you don’t have to be a kid to enjoy it. For the adults in the room, it’s not the same cookie-cutter hour-and-a-half of predictable plotlines, unconvincing character development, and forced romances that they’re used to watching with their kids; it tries to be something else. It has humor that’s not just slapstick and fart jokes. It has moments of action and tension and giant ice walls that can’t help but elicit a “Damn, that’s cool.” Its characters grapple with grief, adulthood, colonialism, and reverse-midlife crises. And while it’s no Scorcese or Spielberg, it’s something — something unabashedly fun.
It’s discouraging, in a way, how successful Disney has been. It seems unfair that a single company can have such a monopoly on animated movies, unfair that they can do no wrong. Yet one can’t help but enjoy this movie. It is emotional and funny, the animation is beautiful, and the music is spectacular. As much as I hate to say it — Disney, you’ve done it again.

With the forthcoming 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage in 2020, local Cambridge author Nina MacLaughlin’s “Wake, Siren” joins the influx of works focused on feminism and female empowerment. The novel, which is a collection of the various myths found in Ovid’s “Metamorphoses” but reanimated in the voices of the female characters, seeks to “recover what is lost when the stories of women are told and translated by men.” Wildly original and creative in concept, the stories are nuanced feminist takes on classic Greek mythology, but they unfortunately suffer from major structural confusions that make the collection as a whole incohesive and disorganized, detracting from the overall message and reading experience of the novel.
There is no doubt that “Wake, Siren” is original and gripping. Retellings of classic Greek mythology abound, but a female-narrated “Metamorphoses” is a refreshingly new take. The story doesn’t mince words — if readers are expecting a soft, resigned telling of the stories by these women, they’re not going to get it. The stories are graphic, explicit, and raw in a gripping and terrifying way that forcefully shows the abuse and violence against women in these age-old stories. MacLaughlin’s take on these tales make glaringly obvious what the male handling of these stories missed — and it isn’t always pretty. Many of the stories in the book involve rape, and it is even more horrifying when pinpointed, drawn out, and placed next to each other in this collection. MacLaughlin gives these victims a voice by placing the focus of the story on them.
Structurally, the stories vary widely — each told in a different way. Formats vary between verse, normal first-person narrative, therapy session transcription, and dialogue — one chapter even contains emails. The use of so many different structures helps give shape to the widely different cast of characters in the novel, but unfortunately, it makes the book rather chaotic and muddled. The variance is a very creative and original strategy — however, the reader really gets the sense that this novel was no more than a creative exercise. In fact, MacLaughlin writes in the author’s note, “I thought it might be a good exercise…to rewrite the story [Callisto] in her voice,” in reference to the novel’s conception. Though it was a fruitful and ingenious endeavor, unfortunately, the book comes off as just “a good way to flex those writing muscles,” and not as a cohesive collection.
In her author’s note, MacLaughlin also writes, “Some of the figures called out with voices that seemed lodged in a time of gods, goddesses, nymphs, and satyrs; others seemed to speak in a language closer to our own time.” This too only confuses the overall cohesion of the novel. The flipping back and forth between the mystical, ancient time of Greek mythology and the modern world felt indecisive and made the book nearly incoherent and seemingly confused about its own contents. If the stories spoke to the author in the languages of different times, then perhaps, organizationally, the novel would have benefited from some sort of chronological order. Instead, MacLaughlin notes that she organized the stories in an “attempt to let the women’s voices be in better conversation with each other,” but unfortunately this venture fails.
Still, “Wake, Siren” is not a bad read by any means. It’s a truly entertaining, creative, original concept that does some important work by focusing on the female perspective in these classical, male dominated stories. Its raw language and bluntness brings attention to the horrifying female tales of “love, loss, rape, revenge, and change” that are often glossed over or lost in favor of the male story. Though chaotic and confusing, perhaps that is a side effect of pulling these threads from such a long and convoluted epic as Ovid’s “Metamorphoses.” Fans of Greek mythology will enjoy the familiar cast of characters and appreciate the way they are being represented in a new light, and the novel certainly has its place in the current political climate.

In April 2018, alternative artist Bishop Briggs released her debut album “Church of Scars, a work rife with metaphors, synthesizer-heavy choruses, and powerful belting. It exemplified Briggs’s attempt to find her place in the daunting world of the music industry. A year and a half and two headline tours later, the artist is finally finding her footing. On “Champion,” released Nov. 8, Briggs grapples with the aftermath of an unhealthy relationship. Despite what its name implies, “Champion”’s overall message is not one of victory. Its self-awareness and smooth instrumentation make it Briggs’s most vulnerable work yet.
Briggs begins the album feeling like anything but a champion. On the opening track “I Still Love You,” Briggs gives listeners their first peek into her post-breakup emotional state. Over minimalist piano notes, the artist sings in the first verse: “Harder than silence / Hard to see you with someone still smiling.” The track is one minute and 23 seconds of reminiscing over a lost love and recognizing that it is time to move on — feelings that anyone who has ever fallen in and out of love can understand. On the song’s final lyrics, “I knew I had to let it go, I had to let it go / I had to let go of you,” Briggs admits to herself that she always knew that the end was near and builds listeners’ anticipation for the rest of the album.
The album’s titular track and the first of its four singles, “Champion” is the most upbeat, optimistic song in Briggs’s repertoire. “Champion” is a feel good song, a musical pep talk from Briggs to Briggs. It is a song meant to be belted out loud when one is at their highest highs or their lowest lows. The pre-chorus embodies the phrase “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” before the chorus breaks into a mantra of “I’m a champion.” In her song “White Flag” she sings, “I would rather die than give up the fight.” In “Champion,” she celebrates her victory.
On many of her songs, Briggs reconciles the dark side of her relationship with authentic feelings of nostalgia. In "Tattooed On My Heart” she admits that, had she known how poorly her ex would have treated her, she would not have fallen in love with him in the first place. “Someone Else,” a piano-heavy ballad, broadcasts Briggs’s vocal range as she sings about wanting to disconnect from the rest of the world and heal. “Jekyll and Hide” — purposefully stylized as “Hide” not “Hyde” — is a haunting song through which Briggs accuses her ex-lover of being two-faced and deceitful. In these three songs, Briggs allows herself to grieve.
If the songs on “Champion” were to be categorized into the five stages of grief, “My Shine” would represent anger. Written alongside singer-songwriter K.Flay, “My Shine” is the musical equivalent of throwing a dart at a picture of your ex’s face. On the bridge, Briggs airs her grievances by shouting the lyrics, “God forbid I make cool shit / God forbid I got more cash than you / God forbid I'm independent / God forbid I talk like that to you.” Briggs identifies her ex’s insecurities and shuts them down. While “My Shine” expresses feelings of anger, the song also offers a needed breath of self-love and optimism on the otherwise intense album. Briggs is shining again, and no one can take that away from her.
“Champion” closes with “I Tried (Demo),” an acoustic ballad about admitting defeat and giving in to exhaustion. If “I Still Love You” represents the immediate aftermath of the breakup, “I Tried” is the final act of coming to terms with the outcome. On the most vulnerable song of the album, Briggs softly sings, “I got one tired heart and two tired eyes / I'm too tired now to cry.” It is obvious that she is worn out, which resonates in both her lyrics and her tone. “Champion” ends abruptly with a repetition of the phrase “I tried” six times, fading from enthusiastic exclamation to defeated muttering.
With only 18 months between her two album releases, Bishop Briggs avoids the infamous “sophomore slump” on “Champion.” Despite being on tour for large portions of 2018 and 2019, Briggs found time to write, record, produce, advertise, and release an album that exceeds every expectation set by her debut. In curating a perfect mix of upbeat, danceable songs and tear-jerking ballads, Briggs navigates recovery from a tumultuous breakup in a way that is genuine and vulnerable without disenchanting listeners.

The early 20th century was a time of divergent paths in classical music. As Romanticism reached its cultural and tonal peak, the turn of the century — with its Industrial Revolutions and its ideological transformations — heralded a new era of musical experimentation. It was these emergent sound worlds which would — tentatively, and painstakingly — come to unshackle a “classical” music identity from the confines of tonality. As early as 1908, the seeds were sown for the avant-garde that was to come. These four works below, all completed in 1908, capture the dynamism of an era of flux in both political and musical realms.
“The Unanswered Question” by Charles Ives
One of the most confounding musical figures in the early 20th century, Charles Ives broke compositional ground, tonally and thematically, decades before others would catch up. Arguably his magnum opus, “The Unanswered Question” is truly a masterwork of the 20th century. Catching the listener in a soft palm of dream-like strings, Ives forges new sonic possibilities, as winds and solo trumpet drift from dissonance to intermingle with an expanded tonal language. Whilst three independent layers each contain a universe unto themselves, through their careful juxtaposition, Ives unravels each self-contained world into an organic narrative, posing an essential, yet enigmatic “question” to composers for decades to come.
“Feu d'artifice” by Igor Stravinsky
A short orchestral work feverishly depicting fireworks, “Feu d’artifice,” in its florid opening passage, set the stage for the iconic orchestration which Stravinsky would become famous for. “The Firebird” in particular shares a similar textural fluidity to this miniature — indeed the ballet was commissioned by Diaghalev after hearing his orchestration skill in “Feu d’artifice.” As fleeting as the work is, “Feu d’artifice” offers a thrilling glimpse into Stravinsky’s expansive timbral imagination, with his expert orchestration — particularly in his writing for wind — resulting in a unified, yet timbrally diverse soundscape that overflows with light.
“Violin Concerto No. 1” by Béla Bartók
Bartok’s first Violin Concerto is the work of a composer in the throes of unrequited love. Written when he was only 26, the concerto — particularly the yearning solo opening to the first movement — is a tender profession of love to the young violinist Stefi Geyer, who, unable to reciprocate his feelings, rejected the piece. Following this rejection, the work wasn’t performed for almost 50 years. Whilst the concerto doesn’t possess the distinctive orchestral innovation and charisma Bartok would eventually become known for, a powerful earnestness prevails throughout. Indeed, the opening violin solo is as tender as it is tragic, capturing the audience coyly yet intimately — much like a first love.
“Le Poème de l'extase” by Alexander Scriabin
A work constantly on the brink, Scriabin’s orchestration in “Le Poème de l'extase” journeys from the lithe and sinewy to the addictively sumptuous. Teasing the listener over and over again with dense plumes of sound, rich string-heavy textures are counterbalanced elegantly with gleams of colour in the wind and brass. The work itself came at a time where Scriabin was deeply immersed in the practice of Theosophy, the ideology of a mysterious society that explored the cosmic through ancient Eastern wisdom. Scriabin’s intellectual interests are richly represented throughout the work, endlessly seeking ecstasy through relentless cycles of tension and release.

“I feel a bit like Trump — I have nothing prepared to say.”
With such improvisation started André Aciman’s Nov. 11 talk and reading of his new novel, “Find Me,” the sequel to “Call Me By Your Name,” at the Brattle Theater. The sold-out reading was organized by the Harvard Book Store as part of their author series.
A graduate of Harvard University, Aciman began his talk with stories of the places he frequented throughout his time in Cambridge, recounting the various “nostemes” — a word Aciman and his friends made up meaning “the smallest unit of return, from the Greek, ‘nostos,’ or ‘nostalgia’” — to which his heart is attached. Declaring this to be the true theme of the novel, he went on to read a passage from “Find Me,” in which Elio recounts to his father, Sami, the night he spent in Rome with Oliver and kissed against a wall, a scene all too familiar for fans of the original novel and the Oscar-winning 2017 movie adaptation.
While writing the novel, Aciman said he’d often try to draw out the inner motives of each character, forcing them to sit in a scene without any plot to push them one way or the other. “What is each person saying to the other that they’re not quite saying?” he would ask himself while writing.
Most of the evening entailed Aciman discussing various themes — the layering of identities, the passage and stagnation of time, and nostemes, to name a few — and then relating the themes to various passages in “Find Me.” Each passage brought up memories of Elio and Oliver’s romance in the summer of 1983 and was greeted by warm applause from the countless fans in the audience. Throughout, he spoke of “Find Me” as a way to become more intimate with his characters, while also providing Elio and Oliver the chance to finally live the “unlived life” between them.
Later in the talk, Aciman opened the space up for questions. When asked why he believed the story of “Call Me By Your Name” had captured so many audiences, his answer was blunt. “There is absolutely no plot,” he said, bringing up the idea his novels being those whose characters’ purposes are only to reevaluate themselves. He continued “It is about a boy desiring another person, and that’s it… and some little bike rides thrown in.” His goal with any of his novels, he told the audience, is simply for the reader to be able to get lost in the characters.
Many asked questions about “Call Me By Your Name,” rather than “Find Me.” Another audience member asked him if he liked the film, to which he jokingly said, “The ending of director Luca Guadagnino’s film is better than the ending of my book.”
Another audience member asked whether there were any passages in “Call Me By Your Name” which were almost wiped away, to which he responded a particularly memorable answer about the book’s inclusion of the peach scene. “I had written a scene I thought I should destroy and I asked my editor… that was the scene with the peach,” Aciman said. Though he thought the scene was “too embarrassing,” it did end up making its way into the book and its eventual movie adaptation.
For many at the event, their knowledge of Aciman began with Guadangino’s film.
“I first saw ‘Call Me By Your Name’ two years ago in theaters, and that was an exciting moment for me because I’m a queer man and I’ve always been afraid to talk about this and this movie inspired me to talk. So when I saw that the author was coming to Harvard, I thought to myself, ‘I might as well take this opportunity,” said Anthony J. Veneziano ‘23.
“It’s a beautiful book, and I’m excited to look at the sequel,” said Nicholas M. DiSabatino. “It’s a beautiful story. I think it resonates with so many people.”
The talk and reading concluded with a signing, in which Aciman signed new copies of “Find Me” as well as copies of “Call Me By Your Name.”

A teenage girl prepares to post on Instagram. She’s waited for the time that her Instagram analytics app tells her is optimal for posting, and after nervously clicking “share,” stares expectantly at her activity feed. A few seconds go by. Has no one liked it yet? Then a little red icon appears at the bottom of her screen, a white heart next to the number ten. She exhales; the photo can stay. For the rest of the day, she obsessively checks to make sure her post continues to get enough likes, each refresh a shot of dopamine.
This experience is relatable for millions of Instagram users, whose relationship with the app is largely defined by likes. But this could change soon, as Instagram recently announced its plans to hide likes for some users in the United States, expanding the test that has already been instituted in Canada, Australia, Ireland, and other countries. Starting this week, likes will be visible to the person who posted the photo, but not to other users. This test is a response to the growing worry that likes have a negative impact on users’ mental health. “While the feedback from early testing in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand has been positive,” Instagram stated, “this is a fundamental change to Instagram, and so we’re continuing our test to learn more from our global community.”
The idea of this new feature has been met with both criticism and praise. One looming question is, what will become of Instagram influencers who profit off of their like counts? Instagram has acknowledged this, writing, “We understand that like counts are important for many creators, and we are actively thinking through ways for creators to communicate value to their partners.” Rapper Rico Nasty tweeted, “Damn, they really gonna kill Instagram how they did MySpace… see y’all on the new app.” With similar sentiments, Nicki Minaj tweeted, “I’m not posting on IG after this week cuz they removing the likes. What should I get into now?” Negative reactions like these seem to come primarily from those with significant followings on the app, like celebrities and other influencers.
Some believe that it’s a positive change to the platform, as the existence of likes places more social pressure on users, fostering an unhealthy culture of comparison that allows self-worth to hinge on nothing more than an arbitrary number. Many Instagram users obsess over optimal posting times’ and are known to delete pictures that don’t meet their self-imposed minimum-like requirements. Chelsea Ritschel writes in The Independent, “Three years ago my older brother told me to delete my most-recent Instagram picture because it hadn’t gotten enough likes. I listened to him and removed the (apparently) shameful photo from my feed.” In 2016, Business Insider wrote about one teen who also “deletes photos when she doesn’t get a lot of likes...she says she has over 500 followers and most of her posts have around 100 likes.” These rules of Instagram are unwritten yet universally acknowledged; it goes without saying that a selfie or photo with friends will get more likes than a photo of nature. With this in mind, people curate a version of themselves that they know will encourage the most double-tapping from their followers.
In an era where likes have a strong correlation with defining both self-worth and the worth of others, what does a likeless Instagram mean? Perhaps it means promoting a less performative social media platform, where every image shared doesn’t have to showcase beauty or social life. By its very nature as a stage for highly curated online personas, Instagram struggles to serve as a reflection of the true self, but removing likes and the pressure attached to them will hopefully encourage the sharing of images that are more closely aligned with users’ genuine interests. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri said, “The idea is to try and depressurize Instagram, make it less of a competition, give people more space to focus on connecting with people that they love, things that inspire them.”
Even with all this in mind, there’s something to be said for the rush of dopamine that’s triggered when someone posts a photo and their phone is inundated with Instagram notifications, and their number of likes meets or surpasses expectations. It’s hard to get around the fact that this tangible validation — a literal, visible number quantifying one’s worth — feels invaluable to users. This is why so many people balk at the idea of removing likes; without the validation, and the necessary element that this validation be visible to others, what’s the point? Unfortunately, this argument can shift too easily in the opposite direction; when users don’t get enough likes, their self-esteem takes a heavy hit. Child psychologist Dr. Cheryl Ziegler said, “If [users] post something and it doesn’t get a lot of likes they literally beat themselves up...Having people a little less addicted to the ding, ding, you’ve got likes… will only do good.” Instagram is aware of this as well; at the tech event Wired25, Mosseri said, “We will make decisions that hurt the business if they help people's well-being and health.”
Ultimately, hiding likes seems to be the logical first step in detaching Instagram posts from self-worth, which right now are toxically intertwined. It’s not a cure-all for the inherently unhealthy nature of social media, but it will make posting photos a low-risk and enjoyable activity, and help turn Instagram into the positive medium for sharing and self-expression that it was originally intended to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


“BoJack Horseman” is now in its last half season, causing collective cries of anguish from fans — both because it’s the last one, but also because everyone will have to wait for Part 2 to be released on Jan. 31, 2020. And what a wait it will be, given that this semester forces BoJack (Will Arnett) to confront his depression and alcoholism head-on, as well as grapple with the death of Sarah Lynn (Kristen Schaal) from a past season.
The staff at IndieWire thought it was a little premature to call the series the best animated show of all time, after 5.5 seasons, but this claim is both arguable and correct. The season opens on BoJack in rehab, predictably deflecting this therapist’s probing questions about his first time drinking alcohol — BoJack goes back in time via flashback, because not even he knows — while subsequent episodes touch on the difficulties of being a single mother, Diane’s (Alison Brie) depression in the aftermath of her divorce and a budding relationship, and Hollywoo assistants protesting their work conditions.
Granted, some of the subplots are revived in strange ways that don’t feel entirely natural, though that’s perhaps because of the year’s gap between the release of every season. Diane’s depressive episodes seem to come from nowhere, though this may in fact be a realistic depiction of what depression is truly like. Also, the subplot about bringing in an investigation of Sara Lynn’s death seems to have been generated to simply provide plot fodder for one episode. That aside, both these plot points will almost certainly be revisited in the second half of the season.
One of the most refreshing components of this season is BoJack’s character arc: He finally begins to address his self-destructive psychological problems in a way that’s productive, even if it is tortured and slow. This process, of course, is infused with his regular deadpan delivery and black comedy.
People watch BoJack for the social commentary, and that’s what this season delivers. At one point, a law is changed allowing billionaires to kill people legally, essentially codifying what many Americans already believe to be true: namely, Amazon runs its people into the ground, while hundreds of other companies outsource their production to other countries, forcing those people into subpar working conditions that indirectly lead to their deaths. The assistant strike makes clear, for those not paying attention, that much of American labor goes unpaid and underappreciated — all the while providing the backbone for the services that people have come to take for granted. Both these issues, as well as that of what a working mother can reasonably do when childcare services do not exist or are unaffordable if they do, are handled with biting wit. It’s impossible not to squirm or relate to what’s onscreen.
Hollyhock (Aparna Nancherla), BoJack’s half-sister who came to stay in Season Five, finally gets more airtime. This is to say that most, if not all, of the main characters get their time in the spotlight and undergo change — with the exception of Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins). Yes, his character is supposed to be goofy and lighthearted, but amid the struggles of the others and their arcs, his story and personality become silly at best and grating at worst. Somehow, no one manages to tell him that he’s self-centered, arrogant, and incapable of listening to others. Though many people likely know someone like this in their own lives, after six seasons, it’s a wonder that he hasn’t shown any more depth at all. The result is a character who is so absurd that it borders on the infuriatingly ridiculous.
Despite Mr. Peanutbutter’s lack of character development, this season lives up to the audience’s high expectations and seems to show that the writers thought about where the characters will all end up. Of course it had to have an end, but judging by these initial eight episodes, it’s reasonable to assume that the show will end with the comedic bleakness and biting commentary that’s not only expected, but much needed.

“Picture a refugee,” Nigerian fashion designer Walé Oyéjidé said, standing at the front of Menschel Hall in Harvard Art Museums on Nov. 12. “Do you see someone who is covered in ash, sitting in the back of an ambulance?”
Oyéjidé prefaced a screening of his short documentary, “After Migration: Calabria,” by urging his audience to challenge their preconceptions of refugees, underscoring the mission of his overarching project “After Migration.” “After Migration” aims to humanize migrants and share aspects of their stories that are often left out. Oyéjidé discussed this project with creative writing Professor Teju Cole at the Harvard Art Museums event called “After Migration: In Defense of Using Beauty to Illustrate the Journey of Those Who Have Suffered.”
A former lawyer, Oyéjidé is now the creative director and founder of the fashion company Ikiré Jones. His designs featured prominently in the 2018 Marvel blockbuster “Black Panther.” The Ikiré Jones website describes its work as “intended to serve as a reminder that the luxury of birth should not dictate one’s capacity for compassion.”
The event began with the showing of “After Migration: Calabria,” which Oyéjidé co-directed. The documentary follows two young African migrants who move to Calabria, Italy to seek better lives and opportunities. One migrant is an 18-year-old boy from Gambia who wants to pursue soccer professionally. “I wish there was a way to make us physically closer or able to see each other more often,” he said to his family back home. The other migrant is a young woman from Nigeria, who brought her toddler with her to Calabria. “When she grows up, I have a lot to tell her,” she says, in reference to both her journey to Europe and her family that remains in Africa. According to Oyéjidé, the documentation of their lives in Calabria is intended to portray migration as multidimensional, focusing on the human element of their journeys.
The migrants in “After Migration: Calabria” were also paid to model Oyéjidé’s designs, which they showcase in the documentary. Against Italian vistas, they wear clothes from his line, which feature depictions of medieval, renaissance, and baroque European art.
“It’s taking the highest apex of beauty and injecting oneself into that,” he said. “We have been historically programmed, and I think rightly so, [to think] that a Michaelangelo or a Caravaggio are gorgeous works made by humankind. If you’re thinking about a population that is seen as less than, what [is the] most effective way to make them be treated otherwise, but to inject them within the most classically accepted form of beauty.”
Cole and Oyéjidé went on to discuss why the topic of migration, as well as the danger and incarceration it encompasses, are not topics of urgency in society the way that climate change is. They agreed that this omission can be explained by the fact that migrants usually don’t look like most Americans, and their experiences may feel far removed and unrelatable to some. Taking into consideration the reality that all Americans who are not indigenous to the land have immigrant ancestors, Cole suggested that the urgency of immigration is deliberately suppressed, and distance from borders encourages this suppression.
“[We have to] be infuriated by and just staunchly refuse any notion that our human responsibilities stop at arbitrarily drawn national borders,” Cole said.
The way that Oyéjidé and Cole encouraged people to consider immigration resonated with their audience. “The biggest thing that’s coming up for me is what we forefront when we talk about migrants and these narratives of migration, and how the different depictions of that not only affect the larger conversations but also how the individuals feel about themselves,'' audience member Molly Copeland said.
Audience members also drew broader, more universal lessons from the conversation.
“My biggest takeaway is that we all should endeavor to hold space for each other, as much as we can while still staying committed to what’s important to us — meaning carry our pain, honor our pain, but also realize that everyone does not walk with our experience,” Torya Beard said.
At the center of Oyéjidé’s After Migration project is storytelling.
“Storytelling is the lifeblood of migration itself,” Cole said. “That’s how you keep yourself alive through the desert. That’s how you keep yourself going through the water, and that’s how, when you arrive on the shores of people who think you’ve shown up empty handed, you have a sense of the wealth of your stories and how complex they are side by side with anybody’s stories anywhere.”

On Nov. 16 at the DoubleTree Suites Boston Cambridge Hotel, comedian Robert Klein performed a stand-up show as part of the annual Boston Comedy Festival, which is currently celebrating its 20th anniversary. As audience members filed in and took their seats for the event, they mingled with friends and sipped on cocktails.
Before Klein took the stage, the opening act, Bethany Van Delft, warmed up the crowd, making jokes about having children, smoking marijuana, and performing in front of an audience largely made up of baby boomers. (Van Delft was much younger than the majority of people in the crowd.) The audience laughed particularly hard when Van Delft talked about “goat yoga,” and how people are better off driving up to a farm, finding a goat, and getting into the downward facing dog pose right then and there.
“I feel like the best material is what I’m living through at the moment and having strong feelings about, and then, in time, hopefully they become well-crafted jokes. I think that’s how I generate material, it’s whatever I’m thinking about right now or really living through, and then I try to write jokes from that,” Van Delft said in an interview after the show.
Klein came on stage immediately after Van Delft, starting his almost two [-]hour comedy set with a rendition of his song, “Colonoscopy.” The song was nominated for a Primetime Emmy, but lost, because, as Klein claimed, “[It] was rigged by the deep state.” “Colonoscopy” was just a preview of the many, many jokes about getting older Klein, 77, would share throughout the night. Making fun of the audience, Klein joked about how he was, in fact, the junior in the room. Klein also mentioned how he had not yet joined the AARP, but he had friends in the AARP in Florida who were getting a killer steak early bird special for $6.99 at 8:00 in the morning.
Klein also touched upon his long and extensive career, talking about the shows he performed on Broadway and his more than 100 appearances on “The Tonight Show” and “Late Show.” These days, rather than playing the leading man in movies, Klein takes the role of the father in numerous films. Recently, Klein played the Mayor of New York City in two of the “Sharknado” films, a part that was originally supposed to go to President Donald Trump.
Even though Klein is a comedian, he is also a musical performer, and he sang for a good portion of his show. Klein sang “Tutti Frutti” by Little Richard and “Fallin’” from the Broadway musical, “They’re Playing Our Song,” which he starred in 1979. Klein additionally performed a few bits with a harmonica.
“[The show was] brilliant. I remember that Klein was a really smart comedian. I always thought he was really very brilliant, but I didn’t know or remember how talented he was, that he could sing, and then he did all that acting. Brilliant!” audience member Sharon Polk-Sadownik said.
“We feel as if it’s our best year yet,” Dean Dimarzio, Boston Comedy Festival organizer, said of the weekend. “We had some spectacular comedians, comedians that have been around for years and up-and-coming comedians — comedians such as Robert Klein, Emo Phillips, and Dana Gould. We feel we have one of the best comedy festivals in the world, never mind the country.”

Even in its 13th iteration at Harvard, “H.M.S Pinafore” can still make an audience burst into laughter with every joke. This year, the timeless comic opera is just as brilliantly performed and produced as ever. The operetta at the historic Agassiz Theater boasted not only great singing, but also tons of comedic entertainment.
“H.M.S. Pinafore” is a dramatic comedy telling the love story between Josephine (Chloe Saracco ’21), the daughter of Captain Corcoran (Nathan Robinson ’20), and Ralph Rackstraw (Henry Zumbrunnen Tufts ’20), the smartest sailor in the crew. Josephine, however, has an arranged marriage with a man she has not yet met, Sir Joseph Porter, KCB (Mike Shirek ’20), whom she certainly does not love. Impossible love, treason, and upending twists — the plot has it all.
The characters of Captain Corcoran and Sir Joseph Porter, true to their history, embodied the queer spirit that is essential to this work and to the tradition of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players. “Jeffrey Davies [as Sir Joseph] limp-wrists his way to great applause, mincing about the stage in white tights and giggling with the mannerisms of the stereotyped homosexual,” reads a 1973 Harvard Crimson review of “H.M.S. Pinafore” by Peter Y. Solmssen ’76. Solmssen’s words indicate a flippant, arguably irresponsible, examination of gender and sexuality, but it is true that “the sissy,” as a pillar of Camp aesthetic, has been present in representations of homosexuality in theater and film for ages. In this version “H.M.S Pinafore,” in contrast to works which have used the trope before, the other characters present do not express any disgust or mockery for the femininity expressed by these men. If anything, they celebrate it.
Our 2019 Sir Joseph, adorned with Victorian makeup, enters the scene with his sisters, cousins, and aunts and puts together a magnificent performance. His court (Nadine Jackson ’23, Sabrina Richert ’20, and Jamie Paterno-Ostmann ’21) helps set the stage for the subtle gender-bending to come. When Sir Joseph Porter bounces on his knees and holds his hands up in the air, his sisters and his cousins and his aunts they join him happily in his performance.
Before this triumphant entrance, there are already references to homosexuality with the use of the words “gay” and “queer” and the gender-bending performances of characters like Captain Corcoran. The melodramatic mannerisms of these characters that have long been a source of shame for some gay men — and still are for many straight men — stand center stage in “H.M.S Pinafore.” Add this to the plot of an exaggeratedly straight love story and you will have wonderful absurdity that can only make you laugh. Shirek’s performance is full of melodrama and refreshing humor — there is no moment that he appears on stage without causing a reaction from the audience. Robinson’s character, on the other hand, uses a subtler blend of wit and sarcastic humor to make the audience laugh. This stands in contrast with the plot which revolves around a straight love story. These male characters in “H.M.S. Pinafore” are unapologetically feminine, drawing on the older trope of a “sissy” character — but this time without any shame and degradation.
On the technical side, the show’s set created a perfect backdrop for the performance. Resembling an 18th century wooden ship, it featured raised platforms, the base of masts, and the cherry on top: a projection of the shadows of the missing parts of the ship. The orchestra delivered a performance at par with the amazing soprano, and each piece in the operetta was just charming.
The technique of its leads similarly stood out — Josephine and Buttercup (Rachel Share-Sapolsky ’21) were the obvious stars of the night. Saracco’s voice as a soprano is just impeccable and captivated the audience in an instant. Share-Sapolsky’s singing also had the same swooning effect on the audience, enchanting the patrons like the pied piper. Every time they began to sing, the audience fell quickly into silence, almost forgetting for a moment about all the humorous nature of the show. Impressively, their characters remained grounded, inciting as much laughter as Sir Joseph Porter, KCB. Share-Sapolsky and Saracco’s voices brought this production to the next level, making it as serious as a full-blown opera without letting go of the style of the operetta.
All in all, the latest production of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players attests to the decade-long history of the group. Melodramatic plot twists and all, this edition of “H.M.S Pinafore” by the HGSP is not one to miss this fall.

My high school English teacher once told my class about how she made the personal choice to not take her husband’s last name when she married, as she did not want any part of her identity or accomplishments under her old name to be erased. Nevertheless, at the conclusion of her wedding ceremony, the officiant of the wedding still introduced her and her new husband under his name only. Despite her best efforts to avoid it, her name seemed to vanish the very instant she became a wife. My teacher laughed it off, calling it ironic, but I think she experienced the perfect metaphor for a social phenomena I am only beginning to understand.
In the middle of October, three professors were awarded the Nobel Prize in economics: Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, professors at MIT, and Michael Kremer, a professor here at Harvard. Esther Duflo is the youngest person to win the Nobel Prize in economics, and only the second woman. Her laundry list of accomplishments include co-founding the Poverty Action Lab, directing the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s development economics program, and becoming one of the youngest faculty members to hold tenure at MIT. Duflo and Banerjee are married, only the sixth married couple to be awarded the Nobel prize. While a husband and wife duo winning the Nobel prize seems like an occasion to be celebrated, some media sources seemed to elevate one member of the couple more than the other.
After hearing of the couple’s receiving the prize, the Economic Times, the most read English-language business newspaper in India, and which claims to be among the world’s top three English business dailies, published a headline (that has since been changed) reading, “Indian-American MIT Prof Abhijit Banerjee and wife wins Nobel in Economics.” Duflo is left completely unnamed, reduced only to “wife.” The verb “wins” has not even been conjugated for a plural subject. To be fair, it makes sense that Banerjee’s Indian heritage would be a focus of an India-based newspaper. However, even with this in mind, reducing Duflo and her accomplishments entirely to “wife” is a huge oversight at best, and grossly misogynist at worst.
This phenomena of reducing powerful and accomplished women to “wife” or speaking of them only in relation to their marriage is a plague that pervades American media as well. When Amal Clooney, an accomplished human rights lawyer, gave a resounding speech at the United Nations, TIME Magazine seemed more inclined to focus on her baby bump, pregnancy, and outfit, rather than on her speech or her work combatting sexual violence in the Middle East. The introductory sentences ironically read, “Amal Clooney was all business on International Women’s Day. The mom-to-be (who also happens to be married to George Clooney) stepped outside the United Nations headquarters in New York City on Wednesday, showing off her baby bump in a dark gray pencil skirt and matching cropped blazer.”
Married female athletes are often described in the same manner, with the media coverage of athletes such as two-time Olympic medalist Corey Cogdell-Unrein, two-time World Cup champion Julie Ertz, and three-time Olympic gold medalist Katinka Hozzsu providing particularly egregious examples. Here, the women are either left unnamed, described as “wives,” or worse, ignored, their accomplishments having been attributed to their husbands.
Sometimes society seems to decide that married women are only wives, as if this is their sole important attribute. Their accomplishments seem to fade away, and they become the half of the pair whose professional success is deemed to be less important. Why are married women referred to as “wives,” but married men are CEOs, academics, athletes, politicians, etc. in the headlines?
A New York Times Upshot piece describes a study showing that women who earn more than their husbands are likely to perform more household duties, as if to apologize for not conforming to the societal standard that women should not be as successful as their husbands and compensate for their professional success. While this standard has certainly loosened over the past few decades, this study and these headlines show that there is much work to be done.
Women should never feel the need, consciously or unconsciously, to downgrade their professional lives or apologize for their success, and society and the media should certainly not do it for them, as we see with these headlines. My English teacher, Esther Duflo, and Amal Clooney are far more than just their husband’s wives, as are Corey Cogdell-Unrein, Julie Ertz, and Katinka Hozzsu.
Let us be aware of this bias, on our campus, in our media feeds, and in our futures. When the women of this campus leave Harvard, I hope that they will be remembered for the professional and personal accomplishments I know they will achieve, rather than just their marital status.
I hope that I will read headlines with their names written proudly in big, bold letters. They — we — are far more than someone’s future wife.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All College sophomores had to declare their concentrations Thursday, a milestone in their undergraduate academic journey. For some, the choice was likely clear long before they entered Harvard’s gates — less of a choice than a destiny. For others, the idea of selecting a concentration was probably more comparable to pulling teeth. Needless to say, however it felt, it’s now done — at least provisionally.
Many factors go into choosing a concentration: passions held since the earliest days of childhood, new interests discovered freshman year, big dreams for graduate school, ideal careers, and familial visions of success. Unfortunately and inevitably, employability often worms its way into the equation as well. In the reality of our economic system, some concentrations may lead more easily to employment than others, and some concentrations tend to be associated with higher incomes and greater tangible success — by which we mean some combination of wealth, social status, and security. We recognize that these pressures often override other motivations and criteria toward picking a concentration, and distributing our time more generally, as undergraduates.
That said, we believe that the extent to which people perceive that their employability is a function of their concentration is greater than its actual truth value. Most concentrations and the broad analytical skill sets they teach are applicable to a wide range of careers, especially here at Harvard where our academic paths will be centered around a liberal arts education.
We encourage students to strongly consider pursuing concentrations that will make them feel happy, engaged, and intellectually fulfilled during their time at the College. Choosing a certain concentration, with few exceptions, will not close doors to careers later in life, but will open opportunities for you to study material that fills you with excitement.
For those who fear declaring a concentration because they fear choosing one will mean missing out on another academic passion, we offer this piece of advice: Selecting a concentration is not so much picking the one subject you will study for the rest of your academic career as it is picking the pair of glasses through which you will view all of your other interests and puzzles.
Choosing physics is not at the expense of Social Studies; choosing English will not deprive you of neuroscience; and choosing Women, Gender, and Sexuality does not mean you can’t explore linguistics. When all of us get together with all our various pairs of glasses and all the many topics we use them to look at, we get the marvelously dynamic village of bespectacled scholars that is Harvard.
If all of this still sounds terrifying, we provide a friendly reminder that despite the Nov. 14 declaration deadline, you can still change your concentration for many weeks — even semesters — to come. Just as a concentration is not the end-all-be-all of your future, the declaration date is not the last chance to change your mind. While it may seem like a daunting step, we hope that this declaration day, and declaration days to come, is filled with the sort of nervous excitement that is more excitement than nerves, more pride than self-doubt, and more joy than misery.
Congratulations, Class of 2022! Welcome to your concentrations!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My first visit to Counseling and Mental Health Services, I sat across from my clinician on a lime sofa. I folded my legs and mustered up the courage to look my clinician in the eye, my chin perched on my upright arm. “I feel like I’m… behind. I feel like I’m doing so much here, and it’s never enough. And I’m tired. It always feels like everyone’s so ahead and figured out. I feel so unsatisfied, so aimless.” I sank into the sofa a little, folding my arms into my lap.
Ever since coming to Harvard, I’ve struggled with being my authentic self on a daily basis. During my time with CAMHS, I grappled a lot with the relationship between Harvard’s culture of exhaustion and the ever-present imposter syndrome, a localized manifestation of a problem existent at most elite educational institutions — that students might perform peace or even happiness in everyday life, but often experience a constant internal, silent struggle.
While not reflective of every experience students might have with CAMHS, my therapist was wonderful. But I noticed that the language my therapist employed to describe this self-curating instinct of Harvard students was often individualistic, not collective — the language suggested Harvard students might choose to project confidence was ultimately always a choice, one that might have been influenced by an overarching cultural norm but nonetheless individual. My therapist would say, You’re doing this to yourself — it’s a student culture that you don’t have to buy into.
The focus on student responsibility for this community problem is one I’ve found as common across the university. I’ve thought a lot about to what extent this discourse of individual, student-centric responsibility for this problem is an accurate one, and I’m inclined to say that there actually is some truth to our responsibility in perpetuating a culture of exhaustion and in stigmatizing struggle. We implicitly measure each others’ sleep schedules, or GPA, or the number of positions that we hold in student organizations, and collectively and constantly calculate about peoples’ social value based on those criteria and more. It’s a norm that ultimately has created exclusive comp processes and an implicitly toxic academic environment.
However, there’s another culprit here that often goes ignored: an institutional culture that actively encourages and promotes the accumulation of accolades and achievements and neglects mental and physical health.
This mentality begins before we come to college, driven by the college admissions process. Yes, some students got to Harvard by focusing on their passions, and perhaps by authentically being themselves. But when the Common Application has ten spaces for extracurriculars, it’s no longer a game of authenticity; rather, it’s a numbers game. And if a student manages to keep up with those many different activities in ways that might look good when applying to a place like Harvard, it’s inevitable that the student loses sleep, or neglects their mental health.
When we arrive as students at Harvard, we construct these false personas and suffer in silence not because we enjoy it, but because at Harvard, it works. Not that students shouldn’t be rewarded for hard work, or that competitive things shouldn’t exist; there’s just no strong effort on the part of the College to encourage academic exploration or social transformation, in a way that balks the expectations of achievement championed by fellowships, or job applications, or really any other form of conventional success. Ironically, Harvard’s most recent attempt to encourage academic exploration, the Transcript Project, is itself a competition.
When students feel encouraged to pursue such unhealthy understandings of success, we become more robotic than human. Instead of being intentional with our time at Harvard, we strive to mechanically fill check-boxes for whatever we perceive our next steps in life are; and when we don’t know the next steps, we pursue the default option available. It should come as no surprise, then, that the two most popular concentrations at Harvard in the past five years are Economics and Computer Science; or that a whopping 50 percent of Class of 2018 respondents to a Crimson survey reported that they would be entering jobs in consulting, finance, or tech immediately following their graduation. While the “recruiting” for these jobs can be exhausting, they fit the same sort of criteria that most focused and dispassionate Harvard students might seek: a straightforward application process, and the promise of a prestigious and comfortable position in society.
There are a few simple answers to this immense cultural problem. Students and the College need to work together to eliminate competitive comps where we can, and make all non-academic spaces inclusive. Faculty must learn how to be more encouraging of students of all proficiency levels in the classroom, and need to acknowledge that mental health is not only important, but a priority. Small things like mental health statements on syllabi and notes at the beginning of class go a long way.
Ultimately, students need to understand that it’s okay to not be okay. Harvard University Health Services should continue to make CAMHS more accessible to students of all backgrounds and all identities. We also need to learn that pursuing a passion need not be mutually exclusive with success. Only through academic and non-academic risks, through exploration and discomfort and failure, can we find a pure passion, a happiness that surpasses the cheap thrills of conventional achievement, and shed our mechanical instincts for a pursuit that is more real, more satisfying, more human.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The managing editor of the Harvard Political Review resigned last week, citing conflicts with other organization leaders over instances he described as racist.
Chimaoge C. Ibenwuku ’20 announced his resignation in a public letter posted to several social media platforms Wednesday. Ibenwuku, who wrote that he was the only non-white member of HPR’s Executive Board, cited “longstanding organizational problems relating to race and racism” as his reason for stepping down.
“I have not taken this decision lightly as I have been a part of and devoted to the HPR for the entirety of my time at Harvard before this point, as anyone who knows me well can attest,” he wrote. “I have faced many instances of discrimination and witnessed many racist things that made me uncomfortable in my time as part of the HPR.”
In his letter, Ibenwuku cited several instances when he allegedly faced discriminatory treatment. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment on his account.
The HPR’s Executive Board — which includes President Russell H. Reed ’20, Publisher Wyatt W. Hurt ’21, Associate Managing Editors Katie A. Weiner ’20 and Jessica A. Boutchie ’21, and Staff Director Alexis M. Mealey ’21 — wrote in an emailed statement that they dispute Ibenwuku’s account of his experience at the publication.
“While we disagree with the account presented on social media, we believe it is inappropriate to publicly discuss internal editorial or staffing disagreements,” they wrote.
In his letter, Ibenwuku specifically referenced a Nov. 3 HPR story titled “Renaissance for Rwanda’s Dogs,” which he said argues that the “supposed change in Rwanda’s treatment of dogs was a sign of development, cultural advancement, and nationwide post-genocidal healing.”
“[The article] was poorly sourced and logically unsound. Additionally, it trafficked heavily in anti-Black and anti-African tropes and false narratives,” he wrote. “As an African (although I was born and raised in the US, both of my parents are Nigerian immigrants), I was horrified at the thought of the HPR publishing such a low quality and frankly racist article.”
The HPR Executive Board wrote in their statement that they have taken steps this year to make the organization more diverse and inclusive.
“We are committed to continuing this work under the leadership of our 52nd Masthead, which was elected on November 10, and remain dedicated to making the HPR a more inclusive, equitable, and representative voice for all Harvard students,” they wrote.
A day after Ibenwuku posted his resignation letter, Reed sent an email signed by the Executive Board to HPR members apologizing for the letter’s “impact” on the organization. The email outlines measures HPR has taken in recent years to foreground diversity. The organization has created two commissions — one on race and ethnicity and one on gender and sexuality — and codified Title IX reporting procedures for its staff.
“His letter of resignation expressed concerns that are serious and important, and we do not take them lightly,” Reed wrote. “We want to take a moment to reaffirm that the values of inclusion, diversity, and representation have been fundamental to the spirit of Masthead this year.”
Former HPR member Henry N. Brooks ’19 said he thinks Ibenwuku’s letter clearly explained his reasons for resigning.
“It's a complex issue,” he said. “There's a wide gulf between a Facebook tirade and a thoughtful sort of explanation of reasoning. And I thought that Chimaoge’s piece was very thoughtful, and it clearly outlined every measure he had taken before going to Facebook and basically going to the public sphere.”
Brooks said that during his time at the HPR, he participated in conversations about making the publication more diverse and inclusive. He said he thinks HPR spearheaded those efforts to improve the publication’s quality.
“Foregrounding that again is a big issue because it has implications for a lot of other big issues,” he said. “The HPR, like most reputable publications, is ostensibly nonpartisan. And you can't have a nonpartisan journal if it's also kind of monoracial, right?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students sought to use laundry and vending machines across campus this past weekend, they were met with a surprise: Crimson Cash use was disabled.
Crimson Cash is a payment system that students add value to and use to make purchases at locations on and off campus. Students can use the account for campus printing and laundry services, and spend it at University restaurants, vending machines, and some business in Harvard Square.
Arnav A. Srivastava ’23 said he first experienced issues with Crimson Cash Saturday night, when he was unable to use it to wash clothes. The only sign that the machines were not working was the text at the top of the payment terminal that read “Card Use Disabled.”
“I was trying to do my laundry Saturday night and I loaded my clothes into all of the washers, and I went to swipe, and I realized that none of the machines could be accessed because Crimson Cash use was disabled. I had to take all of the clothes back out,” Srivastava said.
While the system was down, students could only use quarters to pay for laundry — the machines charge $1.50 per wash cycle and $1.50 per dry cycle, meaning that a load of laundry required 12 quarters in total. As a result, some freshmen laundry rooms were empty Sunday night, and students roamed Harvard Square looking for change throughout the outage.
Campus Services spokesperson Michael D. Conner confirmed that Crimson Cash had been down for laundry and vending machines, and said the malfunction was fixed Monday.
“I can confirm there were some issues reported over the weekend that impacted laundry and vending machines, but those issues have been largely resolved. We apologize for any inconvenience this might have created,” Conner wrote in an emailed statement.
James Chen '23 said that it was a "hassle" to collect the quarters he needed to do laundry.
“I had to get a bunch of quarters to do my laundry today because I was worried the machines would be broken,” Chen said.
Though the University did not send any campus-wide notifications about the issue, Dunster House residents were notified by building manager Lucia Baldock Monday morning that laundry machines were not accepting Crimson Cash and that Leverett and Mather Houses were experiencing similar issues. Baldock added that Harvard University Information Technology was “aware and working on repairs.”
Some students said they were displeased with the consequences of the Crimson Cash outage.
“I think it’s pretty irritating, just because you use Crimson Cash so much, and because it interrupted my laundry schedule, but hopefully it’s fixed,” Allison K. T. Tu ’23 said.
Others took to their House email lists to complain about the problem. In Lowell House, Faculty Dean David I. Laibson ’88 emailed residents offering to provide quarters for laundry machine use.
“I'll be in the dhall today starting at 12:30,” he wrote. “I will have quarters that I am happy to exchange for engraved green paper.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaves on a ventilation grate outside of Quincy House’s New Residence Hall caught fire Monday afternoon, sending plumes of smoke into the air and triggering a multi-engine response from the Cambridge Fire Department.
The fire occurred outside of the building’s Junior Common Room. Cambridge Fire Department tweeted that it was responding to a structural fire on Plympton Street, where Quincy is located, at 1:19 p.m.
The fire was put out by 1:40 p.m. University staff members were removing several filled plastic bags from the site while firefighters were leaving the scene. Officers from the Harvard University Police Department were also on the scene.
While the fire was initially treated as a structural fire according to the fire department’s tweet, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that it was not serious.
“There was a small contained fire of leaves and debris in a ventilation grate that was most likely caused by a discarded cigarette. It was extinguished by CFD,” Catalano wrote.
Cambridge Fire Department did not respond to a request for comment.
Smoke from the fire could be seen from Quincy’s dining hall, which is located above the House’s Junior Common Room, according to Quincy resident Mason G. Meyer ’20. Meyer was sitting in the dining hall at the time of the fire.
“There was a group of students. We began to smell the smoke, looked outside the window. You could see the just, like, plumes of smoke, ash piling up, which was interesting to say the least,” Meyer said. “It was small, just large enough to get attention.”
Students started leaving the area after discovering the smoke, according to Meyer. He said he went to the Junior Common Room, which smelled like smoke.
“I went into the JCR to check it out and it was not super fun in there,” he said. “It was really just filled with smoke.”

Former Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. accused Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay of repeatedly lying about their reasons for dismissing him last semester at an event held Friday.
Sullivan and former co-faculty dean Stephanie R. Robinson left Winthrop this summer after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced he would not renew their contract. The decision came after months of student protests, open letters, and petitions calling on the College to remove him because he joined Harvey Weinstein’s legal team as the film producer faced rape charges.
“The actions were cowardly and craven and Dean Gay and Dean Khurana just consistently and repeatedly lied to the student body and they know better,” he said on Friday at an event held by the Harvard Undergraduate Constitutional Law Society.
Roughly ten people attended the talk. Sullivan, who remains a professor at Harvard Law School, spent much of the event speaking about his career as a criminal defense lawyer. His comments about Gay and Khurana came toward the end of the event in response to questions about his leadership of Winthrop House.
The Crimson reported in May that a dozen current and former Winthrop staff alleged he and Robinson fostered a hostile work environment for more than a decade, prompting more than half of the tutor staff to threaten to quit at one point. Khurana announced he would not renew Sullivan and Robinson a day after The Crimson published its report.
Sullivan made his comments about Gay and Khurana in response to a question about the College’s handling of the situation in Winthrop. He said he believes that Gay and Khurana lied to the student body “about everything.”
“Their problem was that I represented an unpopular person,” he said. “They said it to my face and other senior members said it to my face and then they turned around and lied to the student body.”
College administrators have repeatedly stated that the decision to let Sullivan and Robinson go was unrelated to Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein. Khurana wrote in his May email that the decision to not renew the pair was because the climate in Winthrop became “untenable” under their leadership.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane pointed to previous College statements in response to Sullivan’s criticism of Gay and Khurana at the event.
“The decision not to renew Ronald Sullivan and Stephanie Robinson was not directly related to the Weinstein representation, but rather due to their failure to fulfill their responsibilities as Faculty Deans of Winthrop House,” Dane wrote in an emailed statement.
Sullivan and Robinson have previously criticized Harvard’s decision to not renew them, noting that they plan to use the experience to advocate for academic freedom at universities nationwide. The controversy has also drawn federal lawmakers’ attention — United States Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in early October seeking additional information about the decision.
HUCLS President Thaddeus J. Kennedy ’21 separately stated during the event that his organization had faced pushback for their decision to invite Sullivan. He said the group moved the event, which was originally planned to be in Leverett House, to an auditorium in the Center for Government and International Studies at the request of Leverett Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras.
“We were approached by the Leverett faculty deans and they told us that we could not even have this event in Leverett House,” Kennedy said.
Farrell and Ferreras did not respond to a request for comment on whether they declined to host the event.
At the end of the event, Sullivan said he planned to return for a larger event with HUCLS in early December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview last week that Harvard’s review of its gift policies is a “more substantial review” than has been previously conducted in light of a simultaneous inquiry into billionaire and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s donations to the University.
Bacow said last week that the school’s gift policies are reviewed regularly, but this review differs from a typical review.
“The gift policies are routinely reviewed and undergo update all the time,” Bacow said. “This is a more searching review.”
Harvard has come under fire in recent years for its ties to controversial donors like Epstein, philanthropist and drug marketer Arthur M. Sackler, and the Saudi Arabian government.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 — who chairs the University Gift Policy Committee — said in an October interview that Harvard has to take a “principled approach” in deciding when to return gifts.
In the interview, Bacow stressed that the gift policy review is ongoing.
“It's a more substantial review than what we've had in the past, and it's not yet complete,” Bacow said.
In addition to these policy considerations, Bacow announced a formal review into Epstein’s multi-million dollar donations in September. Vice President and General Counsel Diane E. Lopez announced weeks later that the Office of the General Counsel would lead the investigation.
In August, Epstein died by apparent suicide in a Manhattan jail cell while facing multiple allegations of sexual abuse of underage girls. The Miami Herald reported in December 2018 that roughly 80 women have accused Epstein of molesting or sexually abusing them before 2006.
Though he never attended Harvard, Epstein has long-standing ties to the University. In addition to donating millions of dollars to the University’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, Epstein developed close relationships with administrators like former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky.
In his email announcing the review, Bacow wrote that the investigation already found that Epstein made several gifts to the University between 1998 and 2007. The largest gift during that time was a $6.5 million donation to Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. The investigation also uncovered roughly $2.4 million in additional gifts from Epstein.
In last week’s interview, Bacow did not give a date for when the Office of the General Counsel would complete the review, nor did he explicitly say whether or not the findings would be made public.
“I'm not going to put an artificial date on the completion,” he said last week. “I'm sure I'll have something to say once the investigation is complete, but until it's complete, I can't say.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty-two percent of surveyed voters between the ages of 18 to 29 and 58 percent of general election voters under 30 support the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump, according to an Institute of Politics poll released Monday.
The biannual Harvard Youth Poll garnered more than 2,000 responses nationwide.
“There is high support among most demographics for impeachment and removal; however, we can see that young voters are decided and divided,” said Justin Y. Tseng ’22, a member of Harvard Public Opinion Project, the group that conducted the poll. “If they support impeachment and removal, they are likely to stay in that position. If they don’t, they are likely to stay in that position as well.”
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said on a press call that the fall 2019 iteration of the poll analyzed opinions of the 18-29 voting bloc regarding “incremental and structural change, specific policies, and how they engage with politics more broadly.”
Of those surveyed, 40 percent of young voters favored policies that “stand a good chance of being achieved as opposed to sweeping changes that will be difficult to carry out.” On the other hand, 34 percent of those surveyed preferred “big structural policy changes that address the urgency of the problems that we are facing, even if they will not be easy to carry out.”
John Della Volpe, the IOP’s director of polling, said he believes this trend is indicative of young people’s shifting preference for pragmatism over progressivism.
“In a race of progressive change and pragmatic change, when we look at the entire electorate likely to vote in November, we see that pragmatism is winning,” Della Volpe said.
The poll also asked surveyees questions about the 2020 election.
HPOP used generalized statements from the campaign platforms of the leading Democratic candidates and Trump to gauge support for each ticket.
Among those surveyed who said they were likely to vote in the general election, the campaign messages of Senator Bernie Sanders (D–Vt.) were the most popular, with 24 percent of those surveyed supporting the language of his ticket. Messages from Senator Elizabeth A. Warren (D–Mass.) and former Vice President Joe Biden each had 21 percent support; 19 percent of those surveyed indicated that they supported the language of Trump’s campaign.
The poll also asked young voters about five structural reforms: replacing private health insurance with government-sponsored coverage, eliminating the electoral college, implementing universal background checks, banning the sale of assault weapons, and instituting a mandatory buyback program of assault weapons.
The data showed each of these changes garnered majority support among young voters who said they were likely to vote in the Democratic primary. Background checks, in particular, had “overwhelming bipartisan support,” according to HPOP co-chair Richard M. Sweeney ’21.
Sweeney said reform surrounding the mandatory buyback program, medicare-for-all, and electoral college reform failed to gather majority support among those who said they were likely to vote in the general election because young voters are unsure where they stand on these policies.
Sweeney said he believes politicians need to seriously consider the policy interests of the 18 to 29 voting bloc if they want to succeed in their respective elections.
“Young people are seriously considering these policies. These are the policies the older generation has written off,” Sweeney said. “Candidates need to continue to explore and discuss each one of these because we are listening and we are voting.”
Gearan said he believes the results of the IOP Youth Poll become more important each year, given the growing size and influence of the 18 to 29 voting bloc.
“By election day in 2020, the Millennial and Gen Z generations will represent more than a third of the eligible voters,” Gearan said. “When you combine the high turnout and the sustained voter interest from the midterms and beyond, this is a significant cohort of an emerging voter bloc.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lech Walesa, the former president of Poland and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, discussed European politics since the fall of the Berlin Wall at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Monday night.
Moderated by Grzegorz Ekiert, director of Harvard’s Center for European Studies, the talk — which drew a full crowd — covered a range of topics, from the role of education in political discourse to the geopolitical influence of China and Russia.
Mark C. Elliott, the vice provost for international affairs, opened the event by introducing Walesa, and contrasting the current global political climate with the one in which Walesa became a pro-democracy activist.
“We live today in an age of the need to build new walls, bigger walls, higher walls,” Elliott said. “But many here can still remember the time when our leaders called for the tearing down of walls.”
During his talk — which he delivered in Polish and was interpreted in real time — Walesa said he wanted to inspire members of the younger generation to address the changing world around them. In his view, the Cold War era of “deep divisions” has given way to a modern age of “deep global uncertainty” spurred by globalization and technology.
“I want to encourage you young people to contribute to constructing the new era, this new world,” Walesa said.
Walesa also discussed the hostilities that separated the world into two different blocs in the late 20th century, which he described as the “good empire” of the United States and the “evil empire” of the Soviet Union, respectively.
“Wherever people have problems, felt oppression, and were oppressed, they could count on the U.S. to come to the rescue,” Walesa said. “Now once the ‘evil empire’ has collapsed, what should the role of the U.S. be?”
Later in his address, Walesa spoke about the difficulties of integrating Europe, which he said he believes is especially challenging when each country has its own culture.
“The major question that Europe needs to answer is, ‘What should serve as the true foundation for this new integrated structure we are establishing?’” Walesa said. “Each country has its own history, has its own development.”
Responding to a question about public political participation, Walesa raised his doubts about the efficacy of democracy if citizens do not participate.
“I was taught that democracy was wherever there was majority,” Walesa said. “And now, in many countries, the turnout of the election is suddenly not with the majority – the majority do not vote. So where is democracy if the majority do not go to vote?”
Florian Bochert ’23, who attended the talk, said he found Walesa’s point about the United States's role as a world leader to be particularly interesting.
“I did not expect him as a Polish person to that obviously state that the United States should be a world leader,” Bochert said.
Matej Cerman ’23 said he was excited to see the former Polish president speak at the Forum.
“I know all about him and as an Eastern European just like him, there were similar freedom fighters like him in my country,” Cerman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s impressive start to the season belied the team’s inexperienced roster. The Crimson’s initial play featured two double digit victories and one hard-fought comeback. The team’s undefeated record, however, proved short-lived.
On the road this past weekend, Harvard lost both of its contests, blowing a 14 point lead against the La Salle Explorers on Friday and falling to the Rutgers Scarlet Knights by more than twenty-points on Sunday. Though the Crimson staked out leads early on in both contests, Harvard was ultimately unable to weather the storm of vengeful competitors who turned up their defensive pressure against the young team.
RUTGERS 74, HARVARD 46
To start the game, the Crimson put on a blazing hot offensive performance, connecting in the paint and from the perimeter alike. Harvard’s dominant offense, paired with a slew of early turnovers by the Scarlet Knights, propelled the Crimson to a 16-8 lead.
Harvard’s offense, however, was ultimately no match to Rutgers’s defense, currently the fourth best in the nation.
The Scarlet Knights went into a full court press to stymie the Crimson’s momentum. As soon as Rutgers upped its defensive pressure, the Crimson crumbled. Taller and more athletic than the Crimson, Rutgers forced Harvard to commit numerous turnovers attempting to break the press. The Scarlet Knights translated these steals on defense into effortless fast break layups.
Much of the game looked like a broken record. A Harvard turnover in the backcourt followed by a fastbreak layup by Rutgers occurred on loop throughout the game. Harvard was not able to comfortably break the press until the fourth quarter. By then, it was too little too late.
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith did not blame her players, who she said were “giant underdogs” going up against a highly athletic team of veterans.
“I was proud at how we competed and went at them,” Delaney-Smith said. “But we turned the ball over way too many times against that pressure. We just didn’t have enough experience under those pressure situations to feel a little more comfortable.”
Harvard never found the offensive rhythm that it lost in the first quarter. Though Harvard’s success on offense in its first games stemmed from good ball movement, most of the team’s points against Rutgers came from isolated offensive plays. Freshman guard Lola Mullaney, who returned to the starting lineup on Sunday after missing two games due to an ankle injury, kept Harvard’s deficit from ballooning. Mullaney led scoring for Harvard with 17 points, including five triples.
Junior forward and co-captain Rachel Levy welcomed Mullaney’s return.
“It’s awesome that she got to come in and immediately contribute to the team, which is what we needed,” Levy said. “She’s a great player. We need her confidence and we love her confidence on the court. It’s good to have her in the game.”
LA SALLE 75, HARVARD 69
Slow starts are not one of Harvard’s problems. Against La Salle on Friday night, the Crimson ended the first ten minute quarter with 26 points, while the Explorers only scored 18.
Levy fueled Harvard’s offense, contributing nine points in the first quarter en route to a career-high, 20-point performance. Levy’s points came from all over the court: in the paint, mid range, and behind the arc. The Boca Raton, Fla. native also grabbed 13 boards.
“Before every game, [I am] learning to get excited for the sake of playing the sport that I love,” Levy said. “[I keep] in mind every time I step onto the court that this could be the last game I ever play, so I want to make sure I give it my all...It felt awesome.”
Senior guard Mackenzie Barta complemented her fellow captain’s performance in the second quarter. Barta scored half of the Crimson’s points in that quarter, including back-to-back three pointers. A three pointer by Levy at the buzzer signalling halftime put Harvard up by 14 points, its biggest lead of the night.
Harvard did not hold onto its lead for long. To start the second half, La Salle went on a 12-0 run to bring the game within one basket.
Newfound intensity on defense motivated La Salle’s comeback. By double teaming the ball, the Explorers frazzled Harvard players and forced them to commit turnovers. In the second half alone, the Crimson committed 18 turnovers. When La Salle players got possession of the ball, they stepped on the gas and raced up the court, sending Harvard players backpedalling hopelessly as the Explorers scored points in transition.
La Salle’s strength in numbers allowed the team to maintain this level of intensity that Harvard’s limited lineup proved unable to match. Only six Crimson players logged playing time exceeding ten minutes, in contrast, to the Explorer’s ten players. La Salle capitalized on substitutions, at times replacing its entire lineup on the floor with reserves. The Explorers’s bench contributed 49 points to the team’s winning effort. In contrast, only two of Harvard’s points came from the bench.
One takeaway from Friday’s loss for Harvard is that players must focus more of their attention on transition defense.
“We were falling asleep on our transition defense,” Levy said. “I wouldn’t blame it on our lungs. We were just losing our girls in transition…It cost us a lot of points [but] that’s an easy fix. We just have to keep it in mind.”
The young Crimson team hopes to turn this pair of losses into learning opportunities. It will return home to face off against Hartford at 6 p.m. on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pieter Lehrer, The Virginia B. and James O. Welch '52 Head Coach for Harvard Men's Soccer, will not be returning to coach the Crimson next fall. Lehrer spent seven seasons at Harvard, accumulating a 42-58-13 record during that period.
Bob Scalise, The John D. Nichols '53 Family Director of Athletics, announced the news Monday in a letter to the Friends of Harvard Soccer.
“In order to be good stewards of the program, we believe it is in the best long-term interest of soccer at Harvard to look broadly and to do a full and thorough search for the next head coach.” Scalise said in the letter.
The search for Lehrer’s successor will be headed by Assistant Director of Business Development Erin West, and include Scalise, Associate Director of Athletics Duane Reeves, and The Branca Family Head Coach for Harvard Women’s Soccer Chris Hamblin. The committee aims to find a candidate that will “maintain the competitive excellence we have all come to expect of our athletic programs” and “honor the commitments of the athletes to academic excellence”.
Lehrer’s departure comes at a time of continued adversity for Harvard men’s soccer. The Crimson failed to win a single game in 2019, scoring just eight goals on the way to finishing 0-14-1. Harvard has won just five games in the past three seasons, going 5-37-5.
Lehrer took the helm of the Crimson in 2013, joining a team which had not won an Ivy League game in two years. In his first season, he went 7-8-2 and led Harvard to a 5-2-0 Ivy League record, good enough for second place in the Ancient Eight. The team finished 11-4-2 overall in his second season before going 9-6-2 in 2015, both times tabling second in the Ivy League.
The 2016 season made national headlines after The Crimson reported that the 2012 team produced a “scouting report” which ranked members of the Harvard women’s soccer team based on their appearances. After an Office of General Counsel review found that the reports continued into 2016, Scalise cancelled the remainder of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby team was named the NIRA National Champions for the first time in program history this past weekend. The Crimson defeated Army West Point, 18-7, at Mignone Field in front of Harvard’s home crowd.
“The team and program could not be more excited and proud,” junior Gabrielle Fernandopulle said. “We talked all season about hitting our peak at Nationals, and it was incredible to see it all come together.”
The Crimson fell to Army West Point in September, 34-10, which would turn out to be the team’s only loss of the regular season.
“We knew that they were going to be a really tough team physically and have some really strong runners,” senior captain Emily Prentice said. “But I think that we were really confident in our ability to manage the game and stay mentally strong the whole time, regardless of what might happen.”
The Black Knights came out aggressive and scored first, taking the lead 7-0. After many defensive stops by Army West Point, sophomore Sofie Fella was finally able to breakthrough the opposing defense with a dodging run toward the end zone. Right before crossing the line, she passed the ball off to Beese who dove into the end zone, making the score 7-5. The first half was a defensive battle as both teams were unable to break into the endzones once more; the score remained 7-5 until the break.
At halftime, Harvard’s focus was on minor technical adjustments and increasing the intensity level in the second half. Although the Crimson was down two points, its confidence remained high.
 “Even though we needed to make a few changes, such as getting a bit more depth, attacking the ball more and getting into space, we were feeling pretty loose and ready at halftime,” Prentice said. “We felt good; we play our best rugby when we are loose and we are just playing for each other.”
Harvard scored first in the second period with first-year Brogan Mior’s penalty kick to secure the Crimson’s first lead, 8-7. Mior ended the season leading Harvard’s team in total points, with six tries, 17 conversions and one penalty kick, for a grand total of 67 points. After this crucial penalty kick, the Black Knights never regained the lead; Harvard scored 18 consecutive points following Army West Point’s first try of the game.
“The penalty kick was definitely a turning point because it showed us that we were able to get ahead. We finally trusted that we could be in control for the rest of the game,” Prentice said. “It gave us the confidence to take a breath and just focus on playing our game. We really kept adding on pressure after that.”
First-year Achele Agada scored with about eight minutes left to extend Harvard’s lead, 13-7. With time winding down, the Crimson managed to hold of all of Army West Point’s attacks. Dominique Cantave scored a try with almost no time left, making the final score 18-7.
“This championship was built by more than just this team, but by the generations of Radcliffe Rugby before us that brought our team to this level through their hard work and example,” said Fernandopulle. “We are most proud that we won together, as a family.”
The miserable, snowy weather did not deter the attendance of Harvard fans and thus, the team was able to really experience a home field advantage. Its stadium was filled with energetic Harvard fans, providing extra support and encouragement to secure the win.
“The crowd we had was amazing; having fans who showed up even in the weather created such an incredibly unique experience for all of us,” Prentice said. “Having all of that support from the department, the student body, other teams and our friends made all the difference. It meant so much for us to win the National Championship in front of everyone.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a strong performance by at the Ivy League Championships with a pair of second place finishes, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams did one better at the regionals meet, breaking Crimson records along the way.
Both teams placed first in their respective regional meets, upsetting multiple ranked opponents. This performance from the program as a whole marked the first time either team has won NCAA regionals and the first time both teams have qualified for NCAA nationals in the same year.
However, no upset victory is without a little bit of luck. The races were initially slated to take place on a golf course in Buffalo, New York, setting up for a very traditional cross country race.
Earlier last week, however, nine inches of heavy snow fell. This snowfall set a 77-year record for the most all-time on November 11th in Buffalo. As a result, the meet changed locations just days before the race to a road course on the campus of Buffalo University, altering the outlook of the race dramatically.
Traditionally, cross country racers wear very thin shoes with long metal spikes on the sole called racing spikes. These spikes allow the runner to gain traction on rough terrain while also being light and flexible enough to maximize speed. Runners are often very used to racing in these shoes as most courses are on some variation of grass and dirt. However, racing spikes cannot be used on the road as the spikes themselves cannot penetrate the concrete.
“I think the move to the roads due to unrunnable golf course conditions, ice boulders in the grass, and ice sheets all over rattled a lot of other teams, but everyone on our team approached the change really well and were actually excited about it,” commented co-captain Gillian Meeks on the change of venue. “It got rid of a lot of variables with a really tough course and we could just go out there and show our fitness.”
On the men’s side, senior and second place finisher Kieran Tuntivate echoed a similar sentiment about the course change.
“It was a lot of fun when they changed to the roads in my opinion,” Tuntivate said, “It was a spectacle that we’ll probably never get to experience again.”
The Harvard women entered the meet projected in fifth, coming off an upset finish through a sixth-runner tiebreak in the Ivy League Championships to capture second place. The first place finisher in that meet, No. 21 Columbia, and a fellow ranked opponent, No. 29 Syracuse, were projected to finish higher than the Crimson women.
Led by a stellar solo effort by junior Anna Juul who placed second with a time of 19:31.3 in a race of over 266 competitors, the Harvard women surprised again on the 6k course.
As has been the tale for most of the season, the Crimson had a strong pack of four behind its front-runner Anna Juul who were key in keeping point totals low in a meet with over 37 schools. Behind Juul, Meeks placed 18th, junior Judy Pendergast placed 22nd, first-year Isabell Sagar placed 24th, and junior Brooke Starn placed 26th. This pack was separated by a mere 17 seconds.
“The girls were all super assertive getting out at the start of the race,” said Meeks about the race strategy. “The top five were all right together right in the front pack. We just hung on to the front pack while being blocked from the wind and then gutted it out the last 2k.”
As a result, the Harvard point total stood at 92 points, blowing second-place Cornell out of the water by over 34 points. The ranked Lions and Orange finished in fourth and fifth respectively, and only Columbia ended up qualifying for nationals.
For their strong efforts, the Crimson women had four selections for all-regional performers. These four were Juul, Meeks, Pendergast, and Sagar with Starn just missing the top-25 cut at 26th. As the meets grow even bigger in size, this cohesive Harvard pack is proving to be a tough out, a huge asset for the team come nationals.
On the men’s side there was arguably even greater dominance. Coming into the race, the Crimson men were projected in fourth. They were facing off against No. 18 Syracuse and No. 8 Iona, both very strong teams that were near guarantees for nationals. 
Healthy and coming off a strong week of training, the men finally had the legs under them to run their best race, and the results showed. The Harvard men captured three of the top five spots.
In the 10k race, Tuntivate placed second with a time of 28:51.1 and fellow senior Will Battershill finished right behind him in third with a time of 28:51.2. To round out the top five, standout rookie Colin Baker placed in fifth with a stellar time of 28:55.4, good for the best freshman performance at regionals.
“I’ve never seen a Harvard team pull it together like that at regionals since I’ve been here. It was inspiring,” Tuntivate said. “Especially when I had Bill [Battershill] next to me at the finish line and Colin [Baker] in 5th. Having Harvard finish 2-3-5 was wild. Bill and I are both seniors now and I’m glad we have one more race together in the Crimson uniform.”
To finish out the scorers for the Crimson, junior Matthew Pereira continued his steady scoring season placing in 20th with a time of 29:20.6. This placement beat the third place runner for runner-up Iona, a huge win for the Harvard men. Lastly, junior Hugo Milner placed in 29th followed close behind by sophomore David Melville in 31st. This total of 59 points put the Havard men comfortably in front of the ranked Syracuse and Iona squads.
The Crimson men also had four all-Regional performers as Tuntivate, Battershill, Baker and Pereira were all selected. This brought the Harvard cross-program total to eight, the most out of any program on Friday.
As a result of these performances, both the Harvard men and women qualified for nationals in the same year for the first time in the program’s history. This also marks the first time the men and women have both been nationally ranked in program history at the same time.
The now No. 23 Harvard men’s team and No. 25 Harvard women’s team will have the chance to compete in the nationals meet of 31 schools in Terre Haute, Indiana next Saturday, Nov. 23.
Competing against some of the best runners in the country, the Crimson will have yet another opportunity to prove the rankings wrong and bookend its highly successful season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fans of Harvard men’s basketball might have hoped that a return from No. 11 would spark the Crimson to victory at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario.
But despite the first appearance of the season for senior guard Bryce Aiken, Harvard was swept away by a second half barrage from beyond the arc by the Buffalo Bulls. The Crimson (3-2) eventually fell by an 88-76 score after surrendering 48 second-half points.
Despite Harvard dominating most of the first-half, a buzzer-beating three-pointer from nearly half-court by Jayvon Graves gave Buffalo (2-1) a 40-38 lead entering the half, proving to be a harbinger of things to come after the intermission. In the second half, the Bulls drilled triple after triple on kick-out passes and behind screens.
Saturday afternoon’s defeat was particularly disheartening for an Amaker-coached team which hangs its hat on defensive ferocity. Coming out of halftime, Buffalo knocked down 57 percent of its three-pointers in the final 20 minutes, led by an outstanding effort by sophomore guard Ronaldo Segu.
The Orlando, FL., native had an ultra-efficient 6-of-7 afternoon from the floor, converting on all three of his three-point attempts, and hitting all six of his free-throws in the building that Toronto natives still call the “ACC”. Segu finished with 21 points, along with five rebounds and six assists, out-dueling Aiken in his return to the old Air Canada Centre court.
The Randolph, N.J., native’s return to the floor was a welcome sight for Crimson fans and Coach Amaker. Despite playing only 20 minutes, Aiken led the team with 18 points, drilling 2-of-4 three-pointers, but turned the ball over five times in his first taste of live action of the 2019-2020 campaign. Despite any rust that he had to shake off, Aiken was the most explosive player on the court for Harvard.
In the first ever regular season Division I basketball game played in the province of Ontario, Amaker started his three Ontarians, with freshman Luka Sakota, sophomore Noah Kirkwood, and junior Danilo Djuricic all taking the court at tip-off. Kirkwood played 36 minutes in his return to the lineup after missing the game against Siena with an illness. The Ottawa, Ontario native scored 10 points but mis-fired on all three of his triples.
Djuricic, a native of Brampton, also scored 10 points and secured nine rebounds in 20 minutes of action. Djuricic and Kirkwood were amongst five Harvard players to score in double figures, but ultimately the outcome of the game was determined by Buffalo’s three-point shooting and the team from Western New York’s opportunistic points off of turnovers.
The Bulls were able to convert 17 Crimson turnovers into 27 points, outscoring Harvard by 12 points in that department, matching the margin of victory for Buffalo. Turnovers are a problem that have frequently plagued the Crimson early in the past few seasons, an issue that proved to be one of the differences at Scotiabank Arena.
Coach Amaker acknowledged the team has to adjust to who they’ll be now that Aiken is back, given how the dynamic has been different without him in the rotation.
“We all have to give of ourselves a little bit more, including him, of course, to figure out how our team can become better...certainly he’s a dynamic scorer,” Amaker said post-game. “We also have to learn how to play with him and he's going to learn how to play with us because it's his first game...so we’re not in sync, and hopefully we’ll find the rhythm that we need going forward.”
The Crimson are slated to play Texas A&M in the first round of bracket play on November 28. The winner will face the victor of Maryland and Temple in the semifinal the next day. USC, Davidson, Fairfield, and Marquette round out the rest of the eight programs competing.
This next week of practice will be important for the team to regroup and rest after several players went into the game “banged up” according to Amaker.
“I’m hopeful that our leadership will show up at this time to right the ship for our team after tonight,” Amaker said.
The Crimson’s next home game will be on December 7 against Massachusetts after their stint of away matchups.

The one weekend when Harvard students have school spirit is nearly upon us, folks, and this time, The Game is at Yale. Despite the widely held belief that Harvard-Yale is more fun when Yale hosts, it’s without a doubt more complicated logistically. Assuming you actually find a way to New Haven (buses, Razor Scooters, Heelys, etc), it’s time to find a place to crash.
Sister Housing
Yay for inter-university partnerships! Each Harvard House and freshman dorm is paired to one of Yale’s residential colleges, so you should have a place to stay for free on-campus guaranteed!
Pros: You’re a simple Google form away from acquiring free housing on Yale’s campus. No haggling or money required.
Cons: Chances are, deadlines may have passed. Make some phone calls and hope for the best.
Desperate DMing
Remember that one person you kind of talked to during Bulldog Days? Or maybe your sort-of friend from a summer program a few years ago? Or that one high school classmate who you promised to keep in touch with after graduation but never really did? Welp, time to work those halfway connections for all they’re worth. Offer a place for them to stay next year or a free coffee or the naming rights to your first born, but just make sure you secure the deal in writing.
Pros: Free place to stay!
Cons: That feeling of guilty awkwardness of only remembering to interact with someone when you need a favor; increased chances of having to host them next year.
Tinder for Days
Set your location to Yale University and get to swiping so you can land a couch to stay for the night.
Pros: You have a zero percent chance of seeing this Tinder match in your dhall; no money required.
Cons: You might catch feelings (disgusting); you have to act interested in a Yale student.
Airbnb
You snooze, you lose. RIP to all the procrastinators out there, but if you can’t snag some free housing by now, it might be time to shell out. Grab your blockmates and pool your funds for a rental.
Pros: You don’t have to sleep on someone’s floor; you get to take a break from dorm life for a night!
Cons: MONEY; having to find transport from your Airbnb to the tailgate/game (MORE MONEY).
Sleep is for the Weak
Can’t make any of the above work? No worries! You only need a place to stay if you intend on sleeping. Channel your inner midterm stamina and just stay awake for, like, 30 hours.
Pros: Cost effective; no planning or coordination required.
Cons: Have to be conscious in the land of Gothic architecture, will probably fall asleep mid-tailgate, might hit on a Yale student in a moment of sleep-deprived stupor. Seriously, don’t do this.
Even though securing a place to sleep for The Game is daunting, you’ve got options. Good luck and good yard to all!
