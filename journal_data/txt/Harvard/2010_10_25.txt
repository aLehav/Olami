After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am not a cartoon aficionado, but one of my favorite political cartoons, drawn by syndicated “Bizarro” cartoonist Dan Piraro, depicts former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove conversing with Plato. Rove, sitting down in a classical setting, turns to Plato and says, “But surely you agree that truth can be created by the repetition of a lie.” Perhaps cable news should take Rove’s place.
Whether or not you believe in Rove’s agenda or his politics, the statement makes a poignant argument about human nature. How many times do people have to hear a lie in order to believe that it is actually the truth? Increasingly, it seems as if cable news has been trying to figure out the answer to that question. The production of opinion shows cloaked as newscasts has morphed cable news into a platform not for informing the public but rather for persuading the public that their version of the facts is more accurate than a rival network’s version. The programs on the cable networks do not exist to tell the news but rather to interpret the news. Although opinion is an important and vital part of the media industry, the business of running a cable network has pitted these “news” programs against each other in a way that fosters derisive and ignorant bigotry rather than intelligent discussion. The battle among cable networks threatens to divide America into two groups, with the supporters of each political party only listening to their preferred cable network. In order to confront this threat, the American people must be aware that their favorite newscast may not be the news at all but rather a pre-engineered news interpretation designed for a targeted audience.
There is no doubt that these opinion programs are shockingly effective at morphing an opinion into a fact. A Newsweek poll that found that 24 percent of Americans believe President Obama is a Muslim proves this. In that same Newsweek cover story, Newsweek senior editor Jonathan Alter argues that those who believe that President Obama is a Muslim genuinely dislike the President and thus will latch onto any fact, no matter how ridiculous, so long as it paints Obama in a negative light. Believing that their favorite cable news anchor can only be telling the truth, the audience of the cable news program also takes the opinions of their favorite anchor as the truth, propagating personal beliefs and turning one person’s ignorance into a “credible” fact. The networks are particularly efficient at disseminating this opinion news to their other programs, rebroadcasting the same fallacy throughout the infinite news cycle. It is hard to blame the audience for falling into this trap; after being constantly reminded of the same information all day, it is tempting to just accept the original opinion as fact.
It is clear that opinion news programs are deceiving their audiences. It is also clear that this same audience needs to be made aware of the fact that their favorite news program is not news but rather an opinion program. This could be accomplished by implementing a network-wide rating system, much like the Motion Picture Association of America’s film rating system, which would make their viewers more aware of what is an opinion show and what is a newscast. Such a rating system would remind and explain to viewers what they are really watching. Before a program starts, a network should display this rating system, indicating the variety of content it offers and what each rating means. Most importantly, the network should also display that rating so that the audience is aware of what type of content they are watching. For example, if they are watching a true newscast, a letter or a symbol should appear before the program begins in order to indicate to the audience that the program they are watching meets a stringent set of guidelines that ensures its news integrity. The guidelines for this rating system would be established by an independent entity such as the Associated Press, the Society of Professional Journalists, or a new media organization comprising members of the journalism community. Ensuring that an independent authority conducts the ratings guidelines is vitally important. An unclear ratings system, especially one that has been influenced by special interest groups, would completely destroy the purpose of the ratings system in the first place. These guidelines would be implemented across all networks and newscasts and force programs on news networks to adhere to these stringent guidelines. A more educated public would then be able to make intelligent decisions about the content that they watch, and, more importantly, the content that they believe.
There certainly exists a place for both news and opinion programming on cable news networks. These same networks, however, must become more aware of their power to influence the public. Abusing this power by falsely labeling opinion programs as news programs is a detriment to society that fosters division and exclusion rather than inclusion. By forcing news networks to implement a ratings system for their content, we would keep the news networks honest about what kind of content they create and how they share that content.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
National Public Radio recently terminated the contract of longtime news analyst Juan Williams for his remarks on The O’Reilly Factor that, according to NPR, “undermined his credibility as a news analyst.” After asserting that he is a proponent of civil rights, Williams said, “But when I get on the plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous.” Despite his provocative statements, Williams should not have been fired—he was well within his rights to express his personal opinion when he was speaking outside his home news organization. It is impractical to claim that news reporting is independent of bias, and, in this case, it seems that Williams’ remarks were viewed as a problem particularly because they seemed to stand contrary to NPR’s own editorial views. News organizations must realize that every employee harbors personal beliefs.
In making these remarks, Williams seemed to be admitting a personal emotional reaction rather than a conscious intolerance toward Muslims, although we see how viewers and listeners could easily have interpreted his comments as being bigoted. Instead, his statements further highlight the uncontrollable emotional response that many individuals feel despite their intellectual stance on certain issues. As Williams’ comments suggest, unfortunately, people’s conscious views do not always influence their unconscious attitudes. In this light, we do not believe that Williams’ comments were necessarily bigoted or intended as such; rather, they were an honest admission about his own rote reactions.
NPR’s immediate decision to fire Williams is an inappropriately strong reaction to the situation and to the interpretation that his remarks were directly targeted toward Muslims. The media’s hypersensitivity to issues of race and religion likely influenced NPR’s assessment of the situation and its ultimate conclusion, however poor the decision. In this sense, firing Williams was a form of instantly satisfying those who would exhibit a similarly sensitive reaction.
This, in fact, could easily have been another factor in NPR’s decision—that the organization could have lost listeners who interpreted Williams’ comments to be prejudiced. Ultimately, NPR’s potential loss of patronage may have mattered more to the organization than keeping Williams employed as a testament to its journalistic integrity and discretion. As a business, it is within NPR’s interest to retain as many listeners as possible, but that is not worth sacrificing its contributors’ right to free speech.
This is not to say, however, that there are no bigoted remarks against Muslims being made on air or in the media today. But labeling all statements as such is ineffective when there are many more unambiguously offensive statements to be countered. A statement that warrants such attention, for example, could likely be written off as one of the many that are undeservedly brought to the national spotlight, and remarks that are truly bigoted could thus go unaddressed.
In addition, the media’s association of Williams’ remarks with those that Bill O’Reilly made on The View only adds to the false belief that Williams’ statements were as intolerant as O’Reilly’s. In justifying an opinion poll he cited where 70 percent of respondents opposed the construction of Park51, a Muslim community center located two blocks from Ground Zero, O’Reilly caused the show’s co-hosts to walk off the set by saying, “Muslims killed us on 9/11.” O’Reilly’s comments were inexcusable, unlike Williams’, and a comparison between the two is unfair and inaccurate.
In firing Williams, NPR has silenced someone who was, in fact, implicitly encouraging others to fight their initial fears about Muslims and to refrain from jumping to conclusions about people of any faith. NPR should have carefully considered the true intent of Williams’ words before quickly assuming that any sensitive comment about Muslims must necessarily result in termination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, I was glad to see my president and secretary of state both join the masses of people expressing solidarity with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender youth of America, as part of Dan Savage’s “It Gets Better” campaign. Beyond the sheer joy derived from watching the president follow in the footsteps of a sex blogger, Obama’s emphasis on tolerance and being true to oneself gave crucial support to the LGBT community. But, like many, I was left wondering—when will this support be actuated? How can Obama simultaneously speak of daily improvement while failing to make necessary moves to ensure recent hard-earned progress toward equality is not undermined?
Indeed, this past week also brought mixed developments in the fate of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Though federal judge Virginia A. Phillips originally rejected the Department of Justice’s request for a stay on her ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay, effectively reviving the policy. It is unclear how the Pentagon will react, particularly as it announced earlier this week that the military will start accepting openly gay recruits. Gay-rights activist Lieutenant Dan Choi has reenlisted in the army as an openly gay man.
This week, Obama’s press secretary emphasized in an interview that DADT will “end under this president,” but that the president believes the responsibility for this lies with Congress. But hopes for a legislative appeal at this point, particularly with the looming midterm elections, look bleak. As it stands, Obama’s words and moves seem contradictory; while he promises to end DADT, his Department of Justice moves for its continuation. Just when a decisive advocate is needed, Obama has displayed passivity.
However, if Obama is as strong an advocate as he claims, he should embrace one of the many paths that exist for facilitating the end of DADT outside of the legislative branch. For an extreme example, he could end the policy the same way former President Harry S. Truman ended segregation in the army—by executive order. This option, though the most direct, could be perceived by many as an abuse of presidential power. He could also prevent the Department of Justice from appealing the law, causing Phillips decision to remain intact. However, merely telling the Department of Justice not to repeal Justice Phillips’ decision is unwise as it will not definitively remove the policy.
The other option—and perhaps the best one—is for Obama to send a clear message to the Court of Appeals, and thus the Supreme Court, that he believes DADT to be unconstitutional. As Walter Dellinger, a former head of legal counsel for the Department of Justice, argued in a New York Times article, this option would likely improve the chances of the Court’s overturning the policy.
Additionally, of all the moves Obama could be making at this crucial pre-election period time, taking action to end DADT is one of the least controversial. A February Washington Post poll found that 75 percent of surveyed Americans supported overturning the measure—a percentage much greater than that which won Obama the presidency. Indeed, in a presidency that has been clouded by a sense of false hope and failed promises, taking a more active role on an issue he claims to feel so strongly about could do Obama some good.
Indeed, what we need now is for Obama to start delivering change we can see, not just believe in. Now is not the time to flip-flop and waver. DADT is an archaic and discriminatory policy that should not be resuscitated. The benefits to be gained by allowing citizens to serve our country equally are tremendous. In a position of such power, it is not enough for Obama to promise things will improve. He must start making things better now.

There are two ways of thinking about citizenship in the United States. One school of thought takes its motto from Emma Lazarus’ “The New Colossus,” recorded inside the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Essentially, it maintains that the United States, as part of its democratic obligations, should embrace all those who desire entry into the nation, openly accepting immigrants who seek out its advantages. But the second view of American citizenship demands something greater from immigrants seeking access to the United States. It calls on them not only to exhibit a desire to participate in the benefits of American life but also to assimilate into the conditions of this life.
Under this second view, America should still be the land sought out by refugees, by those searching for economic and political opportunities, and by those who admire the nation’s ideals. But just as the United States provides immigrants with benefits they desire, so, too, should these immigrants contribute to national life in America—by learning English, by acknowledging the values embodied in our Constitution, and by embracing the culture they have left their homeland to enjoy. Nowhere is the need for this second view of citizenship more evident than in the debate over illegal immigration, specifically as it applies to the education of the children of illegal immigrants.
In the 1982 case of Plyler v. Doe, the Supreme Court required states to provide for the public education of illegal immigrants living in the United States. The Court claimed that these children were entitled to the “equal protection of the laws” guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court’s argument is a compelling one because it appeals to what is best in the American tradition—its desire to extend constitutional values and apply our nation’s civic morality on a universal scale. Furthermore, it seems unfair on some fundamental level to penalize school-age children who were taken into this country illegally by their parents. Because these children had no control over their movements or migrations, they should not be punished through the denial of educational opportunities.
Unfortunately, the current state of illegal immigration in this country has placed us in a position where this reasoning no longer holds. In order to develop any long-term solution to the problem of illegal immigration, Americans need to stop incentivizing it. Right now, those incentives include free public education for those who have no legal right to be here, employment in a system that ignores citizenship status in the hiring process, and broader rights like immediate citizenship for any child born on U.S. territory. The way to prevent illegal immigrants from entering this country is to provide them with no reason to come—to send the message that those who enter this nation illegally are not entitled to the rights of its citizens.
This, of course, leaves the question of the children. Certainly, all children have a right to receive an adequate public education; however, not all children have a right to receive this education in the United States. While it is unfortunate that the children of illegal aliens should have to suffer for their parents’ actions, it is a necessary consequence of the crisis state of illegal immigration in this country. Too often, those who support measures like amnesty or the education of illegal aliens focus only on the rights of those entering the United States illegally, ignoring the consequences of their actions for citizens. When illegal immigrants are admitted to public schools, class sizes increase and enrolled citizens receive less attention than they deserve. The federal and state governments spend nearly $52 billion a year to provide for the education of the children of illegal aliens, and only about one-third of federal expenditures on undocumented immigrants are compensated by the taxes these immigrants pay. The rights of illegal immigrants and their children are undoubtedly important, but the rights of American citizens must be considered in the balance as well.
The children of illegal immigrants should not be left without options. For this reason, measures like the DREAM Act, which provides qualified students pursuing a college degree or serving in the military with an avenue to citizenship, are necessary if we are to make any long-term progress with regard to illegal immigration. More comprehensive enactments should provide paths to citizenship for younger children who were brought to the United States illegally, regardless of their college attendance or military service, but no one should be exempt from the citizenship process completely. In the meantime, America needs to adapt its policies to avoid creating the culture of entitlement that has led illegal immigrants to expect rights and benefits to which they have no legal claim. In bringing the two conceptions of citizenship together, the United States can create a culture of legal immigration that both broadens the nation’s melting pot and heightens its national unity. We need to adopt the motto of the first conception—“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses”—and add an important qualifier: as long as you’re legal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson field hockey team has made a habit of sticking with good teams lately, but on Saturday, it simply ran into a juggernaut. No. 5 Princeton remained undefeated in the Ivy League, handing Harvard a 4-0 loss at the Class of ’52 Stadium this past weekend and sending the Crimson (3-11, 1-4 Ivy) to its fourth straight defeat.
But, for a team that has struggled to score goals, the loss against the Tigers (11-3, 5-0) was far from a disappointment.
“The whole team was really, really happy with the way we played,” sophomore forward Emma Keller said. “Princeton is a top-five team right now in the nation—they’re great—but we executed our game plan just the way we wanted to.”
That game plan included a more aggressive press for the Crimson, which helped to throw off the Tigers’ offense early on.
“I think the defense did a great job of stopping play up high, and we have to credit our forwards and midfielders who made the press work really well,” sophomore goaltender Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “When Princeton’s defense was trying to work it out [of their zone], our mids and forwards marked their girls well and were able to come up with some intercepts.”
And for much of the first half, when the Tigers did manage to break through, Tassopoulos was there to stop them. The sophomore netminder tied her season high with 11 saves in the contest, keeping the game scoreless for the first 15 minutes.
“Cynthia has been…such a savior for our team this year and last year,” Keller said. “She’s a wonderful, wonderful goalie, and she comes up with amazing saves every game.”
Tassopoulos certainly had plenty of opportunities, as Princeton built up a 21-6 shot differential over the contest. But it was not until junior Kathleen Sharkey buried a shot in the 15th minute that the Tigers could break through. Sharkey, who has twice as many goals and points as the next-best Princeton player, took a pass from classmate Rachel Neufeld and sent the shot past Tassopoulos for her first of three scores on the day.
“We were a little bit back on our heels [late in the first half],” Tassopoulos said. “We were probably a little tired there at the end, and they just placed some really pretty shots. They were able to get shots off and put them in corners.”
Once Sharkey got going, the junior—who logged a Princeton-record six goals in a game earlier this year against Richmond—proved to be unstoppable. In a span of three minutes, she buried another two goals to turn a close game into a 3-0 advantage by halftime.
Harvard did its best to answer in the second half, but the squad could not keep pace with the perennial Ivy powerhouse. Senior Chloe Keating and freshmen Christy Haughey and Mariah Pewarski each notched a pair of shots in the contest, but Princeton goalies Christina Maida and Jennifer King were up to the challenge in split duty.
Tassopoulos noted, though, that the team showed promise, despite coming up empty.
“Now we’ve had almost a full season of experience, and our freshmen and sophomores are getting really nice touches,” she said. “I’m confident that we can get great corners. The next few games, our focus is going to be on more attacks.”
Harvard got a few of those good penalty corners in the second half against Princeton, as each team earned three. Unfortunately for the Crimson, only the Tigers would capitalize, as Amanda Bird fed Michelle Cesan, whose long shot caromed off the post and into the back of the cage.
Still, Harvard ensured that even a big loss on paper would help the team to improve. Two weeks removed from a trip to California that pitted the Crimson against a pair of the strongest teams in the country, Tassopoulos has begun to see the benefit of taking on top opponents.
“Stanford and Cal showed us what level we needed to be at,” the goalie said, “so [against Princeton] we were ready at the first minute to play at that level.”
After a 1-4 start in Ivy League play, it may be too late for Harvard to keep pace in the Ancient Eight. But if it can build on its improving performance, the end of the season may see the end of the Crimson’s lopsided defeats.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard men’s water polo team and MIT faced off, the Crimson played convincingly, leading during most of the game and overcoming a late Engineer comeback to win. 10-8.
There was a complete role reversal when Harvard and MIT met again this Friday.
Despite a late surge, the Crimson (8-14, 2-5 CWPA) never held a lead in a 10-6 loss to the Engineers (9-7, 5-2) in the last regular-season CWPA match of the year. By defeating Harvard, MIT took the season series, 2-1, and the four-goal difference was the largest margin of victory in a match between the two teams since 2006.
“We never really came together,” senior Jeff Lee said. “Offensively and defensively we just weren’t clicking, [and] we just weren’t on the same page today.”
After winning the sprint at the start of the first period, the Engineers unloaded a number of shots on the Crimson until MIT’s Brian Gardiner found the back of the net a little over three minutes into the contest.
Harvard kept it close early on, answering shortly after with a score from junior Mike Katzer. But the 1-1 tie did not last for long the Crimson, as the Engineers scored again at the two-minute mark.
“We came out strong—usually we go down pretty quickly in the first two minutes,” junior Alexandre Popp said.
But in the ensuing two periods, the home team pulled away, scoring six goals while only allowing two.
“It just got out of hand,” Popp said.
Cheered on by the crowd, MIT took advantage of Harvard’s lackluster defensive effort, passing the ball with relative ease and taking a large number of shots.
“I think we were just playing lazy,” Lee said. “The defense just broke down a lot, and from that we got frustrated, so it just didn’t really come together.”
On the offensive side, things didn’t go much better for the Crimson, which was only able to muster three goals in the first three periods.  The stifling play of the Engineer defense aggravated Harvard’s offensive woes and kept the squad from getting good shots.
“We just never really got any clean looks,” Lee said.
Popp blamed a part of the team’s troubles on himself. Though he saved a number of MIT shots, he didn’t—in his eyes—do enough.
“The mantra is every game make the blocks you should have and the couple extra to change momentum, and I don’t think I had the shots to change momentum,” Popp said. “That’s my bad as a goalie. You got to go above and beyond sometimes, and I don’t think I did that well today.”
The Crimson’s play began to pick up in the fourth quarter. After winning the sprint for the first time in the game, Harvard scored within the first two minutes and eventually added two more scores in the period.
“We talked about coming out in the fourth quarter and getting a goal a minute and trying to get back in this thing,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “I think the seniors were a little more motivated because it was their last league game here at MIT.”
The late Crimson charge was not enough, though, as the Engineers added two goals in the final frame to secure a 10-6 victory.
One of the few bright spots for Harvard was the play of Katzer, who along with Lee notched two scores for the Crimson.
The match marks the continuation of Katzer’s progress throughout the season. In the first 11 matches, the junior scored just twice, but in the ensuing 12 games he tallied 21 goals. He has scored in 10 of his last 12 games, including the last five in a row.
“[Katzer] stopped pressing and trying to make the game come to him...[and now is] taking what the defense is giving him,” Minnis said. “I think that’s helped him a lot this year, so I’m really proud of the way he’s playing.”
Despite the loss, the team remains optimistic as it looks towards the Ivy League Championships next week at Princeton and, more importantly, the CWPA Northern Division Championships the following week at MIT.
“I think we’re doing a lot of things better than we did two months ago,” Popp said. “There are still some things we can work on, but going into Northerns...I think we have a really good chance of upsetting a team and moving on.”

Senior Thomas Hutchison earned a top-30 finish in the Mayor’s Cup 5K yesterday morning, competing in a field of about 150 runners on the Franklin Park course in Boston.
Hutchison, who is also a Crimson sports editor, raced in his first event since his sophomore year and crossed the finish line with a time of 17:20.
In his last race for Harvard, Hutchison placed third among Crimson runners and 102nd overall in the UAlbany Invitational in 2008. He is a native of Corona Del Mar, Calif.
“In his four years at Harvard, he’s battled injuries, been an incredibly hard worker, and stuck with it through all the adversity,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was great to be able to see him get out there and compete.”
The Mayor’s Cup, which is sponsored by the Boston Athletic Association, is one of the most competitive open events in the Northeast.
It encompasses a full morning slate of events, including everything from kids’ 1.1-mile races to a men’s championship 8K.
With the result, Hutchinson hopes to make a bid into Harvard’s lineup for the Heptagonal Championships this Friday.
The Crimson men’s team is coming off of a 17th-place finish at the NCAA Pre-National meet and will look for a big showing against the other Ivy League squads at Heps this weekend.
The men’s squad was sixth at Heps last year, propelled by the first-place finish of captain Dan Chenoweth.
Columbia took the Ancient Eight title at the event last fall, while Princeton placed second.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Birthdays, ironically enough, can turn out to be one of the more depressing days of the year. Birthday fun can never quite seem to live up to over-heightened expectations, leading to the so-called birthday blues.
Luckily, that wasn’t the case Saturday night, as Harvard (6-14, 3-5 Ivy) earned a convincing victory over Brown (7-13, 1-7) on the day of co-captain Miyoko Pettit’s birthday. The Crimson went 1-1 in its pair of home matches, losing to Yale (12-7, 6-2) on Friday night.
“We took away some things that we want to work on,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We know what we need to work on to be better and to capitalize on our strengths. For example, we know we are going to work on our defense.”
“Especially scouting out opponents,” Weiss added. “We’re going to see them both again, so we are going to scout them both again to see what their tendencies are [and] to try and stop their strong hitters.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
In the final match of the weekend, Harvard put forth a strong showing at the MAC, downing the Bears in four sets, 26-24, 22-25, 25-17, 25-13. Sticking to its offensive system and power hitting were keys to the Crimson’s success.
“We knew that when Brown came in after they beat Dartmouth that they could be scrappy and that they would serve well,” Weiss said. “The goal was to stay in our system, and really attack them quick, and you saw that tonight we were overpowering them. They are really good defensively, but we kind of broke down their defenses.”
The Crimson stormed out to a 19-11 lead to open the first frame, but Brown would respond, going on a 13-5 run, tying the game at 24 apiece. Weiss called two key timeouts during that span, in an effort to stifle the Bears’ comeback attempt.
“Sometimes when you play against Brown, and they take time serving, and they start controlling the momentum—it’s a momentum game—you have to continue to go at them and run what we run,” Weiss said. “The [second] timeout we really just had to take a little stress off of ourselves and just run what we know how to do.”
The timeouts worked, as Harvard was able to secure the next two points to close out the game.
Junior co-captain Anne Ingersoll led all competitors with 16 kills, six blocks, and four digs. Senior Mikaelle Comrie and junior Sandra Lynne Fryhofer added 11 and 10 kills, respectively. Junior libero Christine Wu added a game-high 23 digs.
Brown carried its momentum from a strong first frame run into the second frame, winning at 25-22.
“We all recognized [the second game] was just sort of a hiccup in terms of mental focus,” Pettit said. “We just knew we had to come out stronger in the beginning and every little point from there on.”
With renewed focus, Harvard was resurgent in the final two games, racing out to a 15-9 lead in the third. Sophomore reserve Jennifer Martin provided a spark off the bench, serving out the third frame to win at 25-17.
“Jenny did a wonderful job,” Weiss said. “She has been working hard every day in practice, and that’s what she does—she serves like that every day in practice. [Tonight] she had an opportunity and she did awesome.”
The Crimson cruised through the fourth game, jumping out to a 10-4 lead, eventually winning at 25-13.
YALE 3, HARVARD 1
In the opening match of the weekend, a Harvard comeback attempt fell short, as the squad lost to Yale, 25-23, 20-25, 25-22, 25-12.
After exchanging points to start out the first frame, the Crimson was tied with the Bulldogs at 15 all and again at 19 apiece. But Yale’s strong hitting proved to be too much, and the visitors won the first frame.
Harvard would come back, using a 5-1 run to break open a close second frame, going ahead 20-13. A well-timed kill from freshman Teresa Skelly earned the Crimson the second.
The third game saw the teams tied at 15 all, but the Bulldogs used a 4-0 run to pull away and capture a 2-1 overall lead.
Unforced errors and lack of focus proved to be problems for Harvard in the fourth game, as the Crimson could not keep pace in a 25-12 setback.
“We battled in the first 3 games,” Weiss said. “We did a nice job, and I think that Yale’s defense kind of kicked up a bit, and we just didn’t make that last game. We had a lot of unforced errors.”
“The first three games I think we played really well,” Petitt said. “The first and third set we just had trouble closing it out, the second set was, very, very good volleyball, but the fourth set, again, we just lost focus, and [we] recognize that we have to come out and start every set strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard Varsity Club presented Harry Parker with its highest honor, the Varsity Club Award, on Friday night, it probably suspected that Parker would add to his coaching lore before the weekend was finished.
And with some help from his lightweight counterpart, Charley Butt, Parker didn’t disappoint. In the 46th Head of the Charles Regatta, the Crimson won the MacMahon Regatta Cup Trophy, which is annually awarded to the school or club that wins the most total points at the regatta.
The two Harvard squads tend to trade places as the higher-ranked team, but it was the heavyweights that led the way this weekend. The Crimson heavyweights’ first varsity eight raced its way to a second-place finish in the Championship Eight event, and the heavyweights also secured a win in the Club Eight event.
Harvard’s top varsity eight finished less than two seconds behind the winning crew from the University of Washington, despite clashing oars with a Penn Athletic Club crew right in front of Newell Boat House.
“I had mixed feelings,” said junior Nick Jordan, six seat of the first varsity boat. “I was very excited about how we did but also fairly frustrated with not winning it, because we were so close.”
The Crimson had been assigned bow No. 15 but ended up starting 13th, right behind Penn AC. Harvard continued to pick up seats on the Penn AC boat throughout the first half of the race, but the squad from Philadelphia hadn’t allowed the Crimson to take the lead before passing its own boathouse. After having taken the outside of the Anderson Bridge turn, though, Harvard had put itself in good position to pass Penn AC before Eliot Bridge. Positioned on the Boston side of its Pennsylvania counterpart, the Crimson thought it had secured the inside of the turn. But Penn AC refused to yield.
“They were trying to cut it as tight as possible,” Jordan said. “We were being pushed into the buoy. We were getting dangerously close to over the buoys. That’s why we ended up clashing oars.”
When it finally had space, Harvard quickly moved through its opponent, finishing two or three lengths ahead. But the clashing of oars may have cost the Crimson its title.
“This isn’t the end-all, be-all,” Jordan said. “It’s a good yard stick to see if we’re on pace, on course. From what we saw, it was encouraging to see that we can hang with the best crews in the country. We sort of need to keep working, keep on it, see what the spring brings. But I did really want to win it. We were so close.”
The club eight event had no such controversy; Harvard won the event by nearly 25 seconds.
“I thought the team’s performance was really impressive overall,” said senior Ben French, who rowed in the six-seat of the winning Club Eight. “Pretty much every boat had a really good race, and I was very happy to see such strong results across the board. The champ eight today had a really awesome race, and my boat on Saturday had a great race as well. It was incredible and a lot of fun.”
Not to be left out of the fun, the lightweight squad also found its way to the medal dock.
The team’s top two eights finished third and fourth among lightweight eights, while its four took ninth in the lightweight four event. The lightweights’ club eight entry took 25th in the heavyweight event.
“Although our boat didn’t do quite as well as we wanted—I thought we had the strength to win it going in, and that was our goal—I think that we had a great showing overall that reflected the depth of our team,” said captain Will Newell, who stroked the Crimson’s top lightweight eight. “Our top two eights performed well, as did our varsity four and our eight that competed in the club event [Saturday].
“All in all, we had a very deep performance from the team overall,” he added. “Harvard as a whole won the men’s overall points trophy, so even though our performance wasn’t exactly where we wanted it, we are going to go back to training really hard, and right now we are in a great position in that our top two eights are faster than any other eight in the league except Princeton and Cornell’s top eights. So, although we didn’t perform on the top end necessarily where we wanted to be, we are at a really great place going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of thousands of spectators made their way to Cambridge this past weekend to watch the 46th annual Head of the Charles Regatta.
In what has become one of the largest rowing events in the world, both the Radcliffe heavyweight and lightweight crews failed to disappoint on their home course. In particular, the 1V boat for the lightweights turned in an impressive third-place finish in the lightweight eights event, while the priority boat for the heavyweights–the fours–finished fourth in a race that featured over 20 boats.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
It has been a solid fall season so far for the Black and White heavyweights. After taking a first-place finish in the pair and a second-place finish in the collegiate eight at the Head of the Housatonic regatta three weeks ago, the heavyweights returned to familiar waters hoping some of that momentum would carry over.
“It’s always an exciting time to be in Cambridge and the Charles with members of the rowing world,” sophomore coxswain Andrea Rickey said.
Radcliffe fielded four boats–three eights and one four–for competition, enabling all members of the heavyweight team to row in the regatta.
In its first event on Saturday afternoon, the Black and White took an eighth-place ranking in the Club Eight event with a time of 18:43.437. Fordham, UConn, and Yale were the only collegiate crews to finish above Radcliffe.
Yesterday, the Black and White took the water once again for its priority event–the Championship Four. Led by sophomores Celia Kohl and Shelley Pearson as well as co-captain Olivia Coffey and junior Liz Soutter, Radcliffe completed the course in a time of 18:00.008. After initially facing interference from other crews on the course, the Black and White settled down and paced its way to a fourth-place finish. Cornell took first in the event with a 17:48.071 finish.
Radcliffe finished the day by fielding two boats for the women’s Championship Eight, traditionally the priority event for the heavyweights in the spring season. The two boats–the 1V and 2V–completed the course in times of 16:54.651 and 17:12.115, garnering 17th- and 22nd-place finishes, respectively.
“We placed in the middle of the pack, and while it wasn’t quite exactly where we wanted to be, it was still a strong effort,” Rickey said. “The Championship Eight is the most competitive event, but [there are] no excuses. We just have to go out to practice on Wednesday and get after it.”
As the heavyweights prepare for the upcoming Foot of the Charles regatta and the spring season, the rowers will look to improve from their performance in this weekend’s regatta.
“We know that the [Head of the Charles] isn’t the be-all, end-all of the season, but we still want to get stronger as we head into the spring. All in all, [yesterday] was very much a learning day, becoming aware of the things that we need to change and the things we did well and how to bring those things together.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Despite fielding only two boats and participating in just one event–the Lightweight Eight–the Black and White lightweight crew fared just as well as its heavyweight counterpart.
After a successful dual season last spring in which every boat medaled at Eastern Sprints, Radcliffe picked up where it left off, dominating its competition in the Lightweight Eight event. With times of 16:33.524 and 17:13.904, the 1V and 2V boats took home third- and seventh-place finishes, respectively.
“Both boats had really great races,” co-captain Natalie Wong said. “We felt like we were really aggressive at the start, and we were able to hold that up during the race.”
Even though the weather was at times rainy and cloudy, the rowers had favorable rowing conditions, facing little headwinds and benefiting from the flat water.
“This was one of the fastest Head of the Charles races I’ve ever been in,” Wong said. “The water was perfect. It was amazing conditions to row in, and it definitely helped us to row fast.”
Traditional powerhouse Wisconsin led all boats with a time of 16:06.102, while Radcliffe rival Princeton finished as the runner-up in the event.
“In the [1V] boat, we kept going back and forth with Princeton, trying to pass them on the course,” Wong said.
Though the Black and White fell short in attempting to pass the Tigers, the regatta provided the rowers with a first glimpse at its competition for the upcoming spring season.
“The Head of the Charles is a great race, because it’s the first race of the season where we really see our competition and compare ourselves against those top teams,” Wong said.

Against one the most potent front lines in the Ivy League and on the road, the Harvard men’s soccer team fared well by scoring first on national television.
Then, in a matter of minutes, the lead turned into a deficit.
The Crimson (4-5-5, 1-1-2 Ivy) went into halftime yesterday with a 1-0 lead thanks to a goal by sophomore Scott Prozeller off a free kick in the 27th minute.
But Harvard quickly fell behind after the break, as No. 23 Princeton (9-3-1, 4-0-0 Ivy) returned the favor. The Tigers also scored off a set piece, and three minutes later, a redirected shot on goal got past junior goalkeeper Austin Harms to make the final score 2-1.
Harvard made a concerted effort to tie the score, but several wide shots did not help the Crimson’s cause in the final minutes of the game.
“I think that [yesterday’s] game went like most college games,” senior midfielder Alex Chi said. “Long throw-ins, corner kicks, it was basically a set-piece battle, and [Princeton] just happened to put away two set pieces.”
All of the action was aired on ESPNU, the second televised game of the season for Harvard.
After starting out its Ivy campaign with a win and two draws, the Crimson needed a win to gain momentum, and by the end of the first half Harvard seemed to have some hope.
Princeton’s Benjamin Burton was the first to test Harms, getting off a shot two minutes after the whistle blew the start of the game that the junior goalkeeper ultimately saved.
At 8:33, sophomore forward Brian Rogers responded with a shot of his own that was blocked by Burton. The block led to a shot by Josh Walburn that didn’t bother Harms and sailed high.
Three minutes later, the Tigers’ Antoine Hoppenot was close to putting his name on the score sheet, when one of his two shots on goal hit the crossbar.
The pace of the game then settled until 27:19, when Prozeller took advantage of two fouls called on Princeton to score the lone goal of the match for Harvard. The sophomore successfully bent the ball to the left to put it past goalkeeper Sean Lynch.
This was the first time in exactly a month that the Tigers fell behind on the scoreboard, but Princeton also came back to win that game—against Richmond—by a larger margin, 3-1.
The first half ended quietly, with both sides vying for possession of the ball and fouling each other. Both teams had seven fouls to end the period, and Princeton outshot the Crimson, 7-5.
The second half belonged to the Tigers, as the home team came out looking for the equalizer.
Princeton was awarded a free kick from 45 yards out in the 54th minute, and Teddy Schneider used the opportunity to send a long pass to Walburn, who put the ball into the left bottom corner of the net.
It didn’t take long for the winning goal to come. Less than three minutes later, a bicycle kick by Hoppenot sailed wide before Matt Sanner redirected the shot into the goal.
“I don’t know if that was a lack of pressure on our part or inspiration on their part, playing in front of a home crowd,” sophomore forward Zack Wolfenzon said. “But they just brought it, and you could really see some of their intensity.”
Freshman forward Connor McCarthy had the only shot on goal for Harvard in the second half, with 17 minutes to play—a ball that Lynch had no problem saving.
Harvard managed to get eight shots off in the second half, but the Tigers doubled that figure to end up with 16 shots in the period. Overall, Princeton outshot the Crimson, 23-10.
In the final nine minutes, co-captain Robert Millock and sophomore defender Richard Smith provided some of the offense, attempting a total of four shots. Nothing went in for Harvard, though, as the visiting side couldn’t come up with a comeback on national television.
“The last 35 minutes, we were playing catch-up, and no soccer team likes to do that,” Wolfenzon said.
Yesterday’s game was the first loss for the Crimson in Ivy League play, but it knocks Harvard down from third to fourth place in the standings, making its chances to defend its title very difficult.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted last night to allocate $10,000 for the spring semester to help student groups sponsor more events in large on- and off-campus venues, green-lighting a pilot program that will remove some of the largest financial barriers to hosting campus-wide events.
According to UC Finance Committee Chair Luis A. Martinez ’12, the Council hopes to fund about 10 events next semester.
But he added that the policies regulating the new fund will be flexible and depend on the nature of the events groups propose.
The UC will prioritize collaborations between different student organizations proposing non-traditional events open to the entire campus, Martinez said.
The Council does not normally fund off-campus events and provides a maximum of $200 to help groups cover the cost of renting locations on campus, such as dining halls or Sanders Theatre. Martinez said that many student group leaders have pointed to the financial burden of increased rent, deposits, and security fees as major deterrents from throwing large-scale parties.
“In the past, if we’ve wanted to throw large events by ourselves, we would bear all the financial costs,” Chinese Student Association Co-President Allen Yang ’11 said. “One easy way for us to deal with this is to charge, but the problem is that it puts us at risk because we don’t know how many tickets we can sell.”
UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said the UC wants to encourage student groups to create original programs that may be too expensive to fund through normal UC policies.
“They were either not holding these events or were scaling them down,” Hysen said. “It was hurting student life and it was hurting student groups.”
The policies for the new large-venue grants will be available by Nov. 15, and student groups will be able to submit proposals until Feb. 1.
Also at last night’s meeting, the Council approved the second half of the new “Hack Harvard” initiative to encourage innovative campus web applications and other new services for students. Last week, the UC voted to allocate $1,000 to create an “incubator program” to develop promising Computer Science 50 final projects into web applications.
This legislation will set aside an additional $4,000 to add a new set of prizes to the I3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge—an entrepreneurship competition that helps fund new independent ventures and Harvard Student Agencies businesses—for new campus programs or web applications that benefit Harvard students but do not fit the existing criteria for I3 prizes.

With its back against the wall and its Ivy League title hopes in jeopardy, the Harvard women’s soccer team made a statement Saturday night.
One loss away from being eliminated from title contention and taking on second-place Princeton on the road, the Crimson (6-6-1, 3-2 Ivy) had its strongest offensive performance of the season, blanking the Tigers (8-6, 3-2), 4-0, at Roberts Stadium.
“They did everything well,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said of his team. “They just did it completely for the whole game. They put two halves together against a great team.”
Junior Melanie Baskind had a career performance in leading the Crimson to victory, netting two goals and two assists for a career-high six points.
Sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro and co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh added one goal apiece, while sophomore goalkeeper AJ Millet anchored the Harvard defense, deflecting all five of the shots she faced.
“[Saturday] was awesome,” Baskind said. “Everyone stepped up big time. It was really exciting to put it together finally.”
Coming off of two consecutive losses, the Crimson was determined to get off to a strong start early in Saturday’s matchup. The squad opened the contest with two early shots on goal, but Princeton goalie Kristin Watson kept the visitors off the board, denying Harvard’s first two attempts.
But on the Crimson’s third shot on goal, Baskind was able to beat Watson. The junior received a pass from Conigliaro behind the defense and fired the ball past the keeper to give her team the 1-0 lead in the 19th minute.
The teams traded shots until late in the first half when Princeton rallied in an attempt to even the score before the break.
Millet came up with a crucial save for Harvard in the final minutes of the period, making a diving stop to preserve her team’s one-goal lead.
“They were really putting the pressure on at the end of the first half,” Baskind said. “AJ stepped up huge...We definitely felt her presence.”
After withstanding the late surge to close out the half, the Crimson broke the game open in the second, notching three goals in less than six minutes midway through the period to seal the victory.
Sheeleigh got the scoring started, hammering home a ball in the 61st minute for her 29th career goal, putting her in sole possession of fifth place on the Crimson’s all-time scoring list.
Baskind followed suit four minutes later with her second goal of the game, finishing a pass from sophomore Aisha Price for her seventh score of the year.
Price found Baskind as she cut up the middle of the field in the 65th minute. Baskind controlled the pass, and then fired a shot from 15 yards out into the net to put Harvard up, 3-0.
“[Baskind] was feeling it,” Leone said. “She had a fantastic night. It was kind of a whole team effort, but Mel had a career night.”
Baskind finished off her night with an assist two minutes later, firing a ball off the goalie that Conigliaro recovered and sent past Watson for the Crimson’s third goal in just 5:22 of play.
“We just got a good flow going and went along with it,” Baskind said. “We were hungry for goals.”
Millet and the rest of the Harvard defense preserved the lead for the remainder of the contest.
The Tigers—who entered the contest averaging 1.29 goals per game—were limited to just five shots on goal over the course of the match. Millet denied each of the attempts, picking up the second shutout of her career, while holding Princeton to zero goals for the fourth time this season.
“The defense was unbelievable,” Baskind said. “I think we’re finally putting it together. We just kind of clicked [on Saturday].”
With the win, the Crimson keeps its hopes of an Ancient Eight championship alive.
With two Ivy games left on its schedule, Harvard currently sits in a tie with Princeton for third place in the conference standings with nine points—one point behind Columbia and Penn, which share the top spot.
“We’ve got to keep that hope alive, and the only way we can do that is by playing well,” Leone said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recognition of her work with Kids for Peace, Danielle M. Gram ’11 was honored earlier this month by the World of Children with the 2010 Founder’s Youth Award.
Gram’s non-profit, Kids for Peace—which she co-founded in her hometown of Carlsbad, Calif., as a high school junior—will receive a $20,000 grant.
Since its founding in 2006, Kids for Peace has expanded from a small neighborhood group to a 501(c)(3) non-profit that comprises more than 75 chapters and works on six continents.
Describing herself as “politically active and engaged,” Gram said she and Jill R. McManigal, executive director of Kids for Peace, developed the idea for the organization when they realized at a neighborhood party that they shared a common desire for community change.
“[Kids for Peace] kind of quickly expanded to more than my vision,” Gram said.
After going on a local radio show, someone from Los Angeles contacted her, wanting to bring Kids for Peace to Compton, Calif. From there, Kids for Peace continued to expand throughout the world.
The organization facilitates non-violent communication and peace-building through meetings organized around the Kids for Peace Pledge. Children participate in activities like Peace Packs, in which they send toys and essential items with a personal note of friendship to children abroad.
McManigal said she could see the positive impact of Kids for Peace in diverse communities.
“I’m in awe of the children on a daily basis,” she said.
According to Gram, the World of Children Awards Program looks all over the world for grant recipients.
Less than a year ago, a family tragedy made Gram’s longtime mission more personal. When her brother was murdered in Annapolis, Md. last year, Gram said non-violence was no longer merely “theoretical.”
“It is a commitment to the cause,” she said. “I am much more able to serve and commune and relate to people impacted with violence.”
In the future, Gram said she hopes to work with children in refugee camps who need affirmation that violence is not a solution.
“Traditionally, the cycle of violence repeats itself, and those intimately impacted have no way to change that,” Gram added.
The ceremony for grant recipients will take place Nov. 4 at the UNICEF house of the United Nations, where UNICEF’s president will present Gram with the award.
“We are thrilled to have Danielle honored,” McManigal said. “She is a huge gift to the world.”
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 25, 2010
An  earlier version of the Oct. 25 news article "Senior Wins Service Award  for Work with Children" incorrectly stated that the brother of Danielle  M. Gram ’11 was murdered in Baltimore. In fact, the incident occurred in  Annapolis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—With Princeton quarterback Tommy Wornham injured during last week’s game against Brown, the Tigers knew they would need to get creative on offense. But they probably did not expect that their offense wrinkles would be so successful.
“We prepared for a lot of [trick plays], but we didn’t prepare for enough of them,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They did a great job scheming up some plays. My hat [goes] off to them.”
On the first drive of the game, Princeton worked the ball down to the 22-yard line and then turned over the quarterbacking duties to an unlikely candidate. Senior signal-caller Andrew Dixon took the snap, rolled to his right, and then threw the ball back across the field to tight end Harry Flaherty in what amounted to a long lateral. The 250-pound senior received the pass and looked to the endzone, where he found a wide-open Andrew Kerr, who caught the pass to give the Tigers an early 7-0 lead.
Princeton delved into its bag of tricks once again in the third quarter. Trailing 28-14 midway through the frame, the Tigers drove down to the 33-yard line and lined up with three linemen on the line of scrimmage, three players wide on each side of the field, and the running back beside quarterback.
Freshman quarterback Conner Kelley took the snap in the shotgun and faked a pass to the right, holding the ball behind his back in his left hand. Senior running back Jordan Culbreath took the ball and ran to the left sideline. As the Crimson defense ran forward to stop the run, Tigers wide receiver Trey Peacock released down the left sideline. Culbreath lobbed a pass over the defense to the senior, who caught it in stride and waltzed into the endzone.
“I’ve seen [those plays before],” Murphy said, “just not in about 10 years.”
JUS DOING HIS THING
Over his last three games, sophomore tight end Kyle Juszczyk has increased his production from one catch against Lafayette to three against Cornell and then five against Lehigh.
This wave of success continued against Princeton, as the sophomore racked up a team-high six catches for 81 yards, including two touchdowns.
“He’s extremely versatile,” Murphy said. “He reminds me of [Indianapolis Colts tight end] Dallas Clark.”
The first touchdown grab came on the opening drive of the second half. On his first pass of the season, senior quarterback Collier Winters threw a screen to Juszczyk just outside the left hash mark. The sophomore took off towards the left pylon and dove across the goal line for a 26-yard touchdown.
With less than two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Winters and Juszczyk hooked up again. In the red zone, Winters faked a handoff and rolled to his right, hitting the tight end in stride. Juszczyk did the rest, lowering his shoulder and barreling into the endzone for an eight-yard score.
“He can do a lot of different things,” Murphy said. “He’s a very good blocker, he’s obviously an excellent receiver, and he’s one of those guys that you have to account for.”
GIVE AND TAKE
Late in the first half, a touchback gave Harvard possession at the 20-yard line with a 21-14 lead. On the first play of the drive, a pass attempt by senior quarterback Andrew Hatch was batted into the air by Tigers defensive end Matt Landry. With the ball descending, Princeton linebacker Jason Ray dove and caught it, but the referee ruled the ball had hit the ground.
Though sore over the call, the Tigers picked off the very next pass on the ensuing play. Again, Landry got his hand on a ball at the line, deflecting it to linebacker Andrew Starks at the 27-yard line.
Down a score with 1:39 remaining in the half, Princeton was looking to tie the game, but on the first play of the drive, Dixon threw a pass down the left sideline that sophomore linebacker Alexander Norman snagged with one hand.
“To tell you the truth I was a little out of position at first,” Norman said. “I was scrambling back, and I saw the ball up there. I just had to make the grab.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—In my three-plus years of covering sports for The Crimson, I’ve been surprised plenty of times. Like when Harvard students started believing that men’s basketball could win last winter, or when men’s lacrosse upended Duke in Durham in 2009. But never have I been quite as baffled as I was during Saturday’s football game at Princeton.
I expected the Crimson to come in and pick up a big road win. I expected Andrew Hatch to make his return under center. Did I expect to see a game that featured six different passers, a pair of position players completing their first career touchdown passes, and the return of a quarterback whose season was supposedly over before it began?
Hell no.
But when all was said and done, the Tigers had scored half their points off electrifying trick plays, and junior Collier Winters—showing no sign of the hip injury that was supposed to sideline him for the season—stepped back into the quarterback role with ease.
When Winters came out to start the second half, the entire press box was shocked. The first play was officially marked as a rush by Hatch—who had played the entire first half—and after Winters capped his first drive with a touchdown strike, a Princeton staffer had to come down and confirm with the Harvard communications director that it wasn’t some jersey-swapping that put No. 16 back on the field.
It’s easy to understand the surprise. After all, Crimson coach Tim Murphy said in a Sept. 9 interview that “it would be miraculous to see [Winters] again this season.”
Winters himself didn’t even know that he’d be asked to play until halftime.
“I was told to go warm up,” he said. “I prepared all week as if I was going to play, so if I got that opportunity—which I did, fortunately—then I was going to be ready.”
The All-Ivy signal-caller is back, and with his return, the outlook for the rest of Harvard’s season just got a little brighter. Instead of having just one healthy quarterback, the Crimson now has three.
Hatch was not as sparkling in his return from the concussion that sidelined him for the last three games. In one half of play, the senior completed just nine of 21 pass attempts for 98 yards while throwing a pair of picks.
Winters was asked to throw the ball less, but he finished 8-of-12 with two touchdowns and one interception.
“I just thank God for the opportunity,” he said. “Being able to play football is the funnest thing in the world for me.”
Judging solely by Saturday’s performance, it seems that Winters just might have his old job back. But there are certainly questions remaining—most critically, whether or not Winters can stay healthy and keep up the level of conditioning required to excel in the Ivy League.
But whoever gets the start at Dartmouth next weekend, Harvard’s got its first legitimate midseason quarterback competition since the days of Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 and Liam O’Hagan ’08-’09, and that can only be a good thing.
Hatch and Winters both bring different strengths to the table. Hatch has still only played two and a half games at the varsity level for the Crimson, while Winters has a whole season of starting experience under his belt.
Hatch is more of a pure passer, while Winters relies more on his scrappy athleticism to move the ball up the field.
Will Murphy ultimately choose one of the two to be his starter, or will he try to devise a rotation to play to both men’s strengths? It’s too soon to tell, but this is one dilemma Murphy is only too happy to have.
“I guarantee you this: I’ll sleep a little better at night,” the coach said after the game. “But it’s great. We go from a little bit of an adverse position to a position where we feel like we’ve got some leadership, got some experience, and we can probably diversify our offense a little more.”
To surprise Penn—which cemented its role as Ivy favorite Saturday with a 27-20 win over Yale—Harvard’s going to need to be at the top of its game. But with both Hatch and Winters back in the mix, the Crimson is a big step closer to achieving just that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many political pundits continue to emphasize the public’s frustration with taxation, Vanessa S. Williamson—a graduate student in government and social policy—started a website last August to take the conversation in a new direction.
The website, dubbed “I Heart Taxes,” was created as a way for individuals to showcase their pride in the “patriotic pro-tax movement,” according to Williamson.
“[If you are] proud to be a taxpayer, you could really show your pride,” Williamson said.
“I Heart Taxes” is a combination of a blog providing tax-related commentary with an online store selling merchandise that highlights how tax dollars are used to support government programs.
Williamson, who launched the website on the anniversary of Social Security’s creation this past summer, said that her inspiration sprung from her friends’ Facebook status updates around Tax Day that praised their monetary contributions to government programs.
Williamson said she wanted to create a site where people would be able to show similar enthusiasm.
The site’s merchandise is branded with sayings such as “Taxes Fight Fires” and “Taxes Feed Kids.” Williamson’s next product line will tout “Taxes Put Man on the Moon.”
“Our government is something we can all contribute to,” says Williamson, who added that she chose to donate all profits from the site to the Treasury as a way to support a variety of government projects.
For Williamson, the political debates about taxation often mask the real concerns of Americans.
“The focus on taxes is an absolute red herring,” she said. “This election and the next election are about jobs...unemployed people would be really excited to pay some taxes because they would have a job.”
Williamson said the response to her website has been “universally positive.” Government and Sociology Professor Theda R. Skocpol—who is Williamson’s academic advisor—praised the creativity of “I Heart Taxes,” which she said “takes on the tax issue in a humorous way.”
Skocpol and Williamson are currently collaborating on a book that will examine the Tea Party movement, with a focus on the movement’s views on taxation.
Skocpol and Williamson’s research has shown that Tea Party members are not as opposed to government benefit programs as is commonly thought, but instead are angry about people they view as less-deserving receiving those benefits.
Prior to her work as a graduate student, Williamson served as policy director for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a non-profit advocacy organization.
“There is a lot of opportunity right now to shape policy in a lot of arenas, and taxes are just one of them,” Williamson said. “If I thought everything were going right politically, I would study medieval French poetry.”

Speaking at the “Bridging the Gap” forum last Saturday night, David Rosenberg likened the relationship between poverty and sub-standard education to the circular debate over which came first—the chicken or the egg?
“It doesn’t matter,” said Rosenberg, vice president of Insights and Digital Media for Teach For America, “because at the end of the day, this argument doesn’t do anything to help the kids in this situation.”
Rosenberg was one of nine speakers at the forum, which was organized by Students Taking On Poverty in recognition of the United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.
One by one, the speakers took the stage at Sanders Theatre, sharing how they have taken action against poverty through their interests and careers in education, politics, and gender issues.
“By hearing these speakers, we want people to realize they can integrate whatever they  are passionate about with fighting poverty,” said Erica K.  Senat ’12, a co-president of STOP.
Senat and Alexandra L. Almore ’12, STOP’s other co-president, began planning for the event last summer. Almore said she was inspired after attending “Harvard Thinks Big”—a student-organized discussion that featured 10 Harvard professors talking for 10 minutes on topics of their choice—last February.
“It was very difficult choosing the panelists,” Almore said. “We wanted to have a wide spectrum of speakers.”
Professor William Julius Wilson, STOP faculty adviser, said in the welcoming remarks that eradicating poverty “ought to be one of the most urgent and important goals of the 21st century.”
The panelists echoed that sentiment.
“Eradication of poverty is our ethical responsibility,” said former Haitian Prime Minister Michèle D. Pierre-Louis. “Get involved. Be bold.”
Pierre-Louis described how, despite their own dire living conditions, individuals in Haiti have coordinated community efforts to fight poverty. She said Haitian volunteers have invested in agriculture and environment, created jobs and parks, and funded child education.
Rosenberg focused his talk on the achievement gap in American education, which he said causes a continuous cycle of sustained poverty, lack of capacity, and poor performance. In order to decrease and ultimately eliminate the gap, Rosenberg stressed the need to create sustainable changes through immediate impact in the classroom and deeper understanding of issues around poverty.
“We see evidence every day that, given the right opportunities, all kids can succeed,” Rosenberg said.
A reception following the event in the Queen’s Head Pub gave the audience a chance to interact with the speakers and share their ideas on how to tackle poverty.
Stephanie R. Charles ’14, who grew up in Haiti, said she enjoyed hearing other people’s perspectives on poverty. Charles currently serves as a student liaison for Pierre-Louis, who is a resident fellow this semester at the Institute of Politics.
“We want people to leave the event with an ‘aha!’ moment,” Senat said.
The other speakers at the event included Timothy Nelson, lecturer of sociology and social policy at the Kennedy School; Dennis W. Archer, the first African American president of the American Bar Association and former mayor of Detroit; Donna Barry, director of policy and advocacy for Partners In Health; Joshua Bennett, spoken word artist; Chiwen Bao ’01, a Social Studies lecturer who teaches on Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality; Hugo Van Vuuren, 2010 TED Fellow and founding fellow of The Lab at Harvard; and Ronald F. Ferguson, an economist and lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

Highlighting an interdisciplinary approach to studying Africa, the Committee on African Studies last Friday held “Africa in Motion,” a day-long symposium that featured Harvard faculty, journalists, and current and former fellows.
Speakers pointed to positive developments in Africa’s trajectory throughout the day, while also critiquing outdated methods of looking at the continent.
Panelists from diverse fields of study—from history and anthropology to medicine and business—introduced themselves with short contextual lectures, then discussed the outlook on healthcare, the economy, and statehood in Africa. The event ended with a roundtable moderated by History Professor Caroline M. Elkins, chair of the Standing Committee on African Studies.
Kennedy School student Sagal M. Abshir, who asked one of the panels about the absence of a stable state in Somalia, said the speakers provided unique perspectives.
“They came at it from completely different angles, which was all very interesting and very rich,” she said.
The symposium, which was funded by the Provost’s Office, the Du Bois Institute, and other donors, also served to show Harvard’s commitment to liberal arts, according to Elizabeth Liao, who works with the Committee.
Speakers noted the historic nature of holding an interdisciplinary discussion on African issues.
“When I was in graduate school, we just didn’t study Africa,” said Monica D. Toft, an associate professor of public policy at the Kennedy School. “It was off the map, in a sense.”
Toft, who was also a panelist, added that, in the past, the continent was studied primarily in the context of comparative politics.
“This does mark a historic moment, not merely for Harvard, but for African studies [in the United States],” said John L. Comaroff, a professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago who chaired one of the panels.
Liao said that the event was indicative of the Committee’s increasing prominence since Elkins became chair.
Earlier this year, the Department of Education designated the Committee on African Studies as a National Resource Center, an honor that will bring with it $2.5 million in grants over the next four years.
“Harvard is extremely interested in expanding its engagement in Africa,” Liao said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—Halloween may be a week away, but the trickery started early at Princeton Stadium.
With the Harvard football team in town Saturday afternoon, the Tigers (1-5, 0-3 Ivy) pulled out all the stops—scoring twice off of trick plays—in an attempt to upset their visitors. But anchored by its strong rushing attack, the Crimson (4-2, 2-1) managed to overpower its opponent, coming away with the 45-28 win.
“We’re not the most beautiful team aesthetically, but we really play hard, and that was the key to victory [Saturday],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “The effort has been tremendous.”
Senior and sophomore running backs Gino Gordon and Treavor Scales led the Crimson attack, combining for 338 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. Gordon finished with a career-high 204 rushing yards on 20 attempts—averaging 10.2 yards per carry—while Scales chipped in with 134 yards.
“Both those running backs are good players,” Princeton coach Bob Surace said. “They make you miss.”
Harvard had less success in the air—passing for just 189 yards—despite the return of senior quarterback Andrew Hatch and junior quarterback Collier Winters.
Hatch—seeing his first action since sustaining a concussion in the second week of the season—started the game under center but was replaced by Winters at the half after throwing two interceptions and completing just nine of 21 attempts.
Winters fared better in his first game since a preseason hip injury, throwing two touchdown passes to help the Crimson to the 17-point victory.
But despite the lopsided outcome, Harvard had to play catch-up early on.
Princeton came out on tear, picking apart the Crimson defense on its opening drive and finding the endzone just 2:04 into the contest.
Using a series of short passes from senior quarterback Andrew Dixon and a 32-yard run from running back Jordan Culbreath, the Tigers advanced deep into their opponent’s territory.
Using the first of two trick plays, Princeton struck on just its sixth play from scrimmage.
On third down at the Harvard 22-yard line, Tiger tight end Harry Flaherty lofted a deep ball to the wide-open Andrew Kerr just in front of the endzone, and Kerr took it to the house to give Princeton the 7-0 lead.
“They schemed up some good plays on us,” said Harvard captain Collin Zych, who finished with a game-high 15 tackles.
The Crimson’s woes continued into its first offensive possession. Hatch and the rest of the Harvard offense got off to a slow start, going three-and-out on their first possession.
Princeton’s second drive got off to nearly as seamless a start as its first. Behind the direction of freshman signal caller Connor Kelley and Princeton’s Wildcat offense, the Tigers drove to the Crimson 31-yard line.
But just when it looked like the home team was poised to strike again, Harvard junior Dan Minamide picked off Kelley’s attempt for the endzone.
With momentum on its side, the Crimson marched down the field. Gordon led the charge, taking off for a 52-yard run on his first rushing attempt. Gordon took the handoff from Hatch, juked past one defender, made his way to the right sideline, and raced to the Princeton 42 before being brought down.
Gordon then capped off the drive three plays later, scoring from 22 yards out on a pitch to knot the score at 7-7 with 6:40 left in the first quarter.
It didn’t take long for Harvard to score again.
After the Harvard defense forced Princeton to punt on its next two possessions, the Crimson continued to rely on its ground game, moving the ball from its own 20 to the Tiger 46 on its first drive of the second quarter. This time, Scales was the Harvard rusher to find the end zone, breaking a tackle near midfield then sprinting down the left sideline for the 46-yard touchdown run, giving his team the 14-7 lead.
“We ran the ball hard,” Murphy said. “Since [week two] we’ve really re-established our mental and physical toughness running the football.”
But the Tigers answered on their next possession. Facing third-and-goal seven yards from the end zone, Princeton called on Kerr again. This time the wide receiver hauled in a pass from Dixon, catching the ball in the back corner of the endzone to even the score at 14 with 9:45 left in the half.
The Crimson regained the lead before the break, relying on third-string sophomore running back Rich Zajeski. After his first two rushes brought the squad to the Princeton nine, Zajeski punched the ball through for the score to put Harvard ahead, 21-14, heading into halftime.
The lead grew from there. Winters, who replaced Hatch to start the third quarter, extended the lead to 14 early in the quarter, connecting with sophomore tight end Kyle Juszczyk for a 26-yard score.
Princeton responded less than six minutes later, when Culbreath found wide receiver Trey Peacock in the endzone off a halfback toss to cut the Crimson’s lead to seven.
But that was as close as the Tigers would get.
After a 21-yard field goal from freshman David Mothander put Harvard up by 10 late in the third quarter, the visitors sealed the victory early in the fourth, blocking a punt deep in Princeton territory and recovering it in the endzone for a touchdown.
“The margin for error is so slim,” Surace said. “We can’t make those mistakes.”
Down 38-21 with 14:37 left on the clock, the Tigers scrambled to get back in the game, getting one last score from Peacock off a one-yard rush with less than five minutes to play. But the Crimson held firm from there, recovering the ensuing onside kick and then padding its lead with a late strike, putting the final score at 45-28.
With the win, Harvard remains one game behind Penn and Brown in the Ivy League standings heading into the heart of conference play.
“This was an important game for us,” Winters said. “It gives us a head of steam heading into these last four games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A white van rolled into the parking lot of Pound Hall last Friday afternoon and unloaded seven coolers of meat to kick off the third annual Meat Meet at the Harvard Law School.
About a dozen customers gathered around the coolers—filled to the brim with various cuts of beef, lamb, and pork—to dig through and grab as many pieces they could fit in their bags, and purchase by the pound.
JJ Gonson, a personal chef, said she was motivated to create the market to sell meat from a local provider—Stillman’s Farm—because there are no winter farmer’s markets locally. She added that this makes her job difficult since she often needs to buy large quantities of meat and is forced to drive “out to the middle of nowhere.”
“It’s shocking that in the Boston area we consider ourselves progressive,” Gonson said. “And here we are, still in a parking lot, and still lacking a year-round market.”
Gonson said her ultimate goal in creating the market was to reduce the miles and hands that people’s meat goes through.
“This way it is literally farmer to consumer, with no middleman,” said Gonson. “It’s pure, direct—farm to table.”
Gonson added that she sees the Meat Meets, which are held about once a month throughout the Boston area, as an opportunity to help build community. “I want this to be a gathering, a chance for people to come together, trade recipes, share their enthusiasm,” Gonson said.
Standing in line last Friday, customers shared Gonson’s excitement as they revealed their juiciest “meat secrets”—disclosing everything from their “secret ingredient” for the perfect homemade beef jerky to where to go to find organ meats for a dollar.
For others, the market offered a chance to support local farms.
“This is true sustainable agriculture and I want to encourage it,” said Mathieu P. Lalonde, who earned a doctorate in chemistry and chemical biology from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. “When you raise animals on open pastures, it’s completely sustainable.”
But Avalon C. S. Owens ’13—president of Vegitas, the Harvard College Vegetarian Society—called into question this view on “open pastures”.
“It’s easy for a farm to claim that they are a free-range farm, but in the end there is no oversight because they aren’t regulated by the [Food and Drug Administration],” Owens said.
Owens said it wasn’t the concept of a meat market that was the problem. Instead, she said she was concerned with the lack of information made available at such markets.
“It’s just really important that people understand where their meat is coming from because...they could really just be supporting one more factory farm,” she added.
Gonson said she hopes the concept of a winter market will gain momentum, adding that she wants to eventually add vegetables to the market.
Meat enthusiasts remain loyal, Gonson added, and customers even show up in freezing conditions in the dead of winter.
“I have seen incredible dedication in customers,” Gonson said.

Slanty Eyed Mama—a duo of female, Asian-American contemporary musicians—began its college tour last Saturday night at the New College Theatre Studio.
The group—consisting of Kate Rigg on vocal and Lyris Hung on electric violin—seeks to challenge stereotypes about race, gender, and sexuality through lyricism, rap, and freestyle.
Rigg and Hung have been collaborating since they met at the Juilliard School, where they were both students.
During the Saturday night show, Rigg poked fun at labels and preconceived notions, specifically those about Asian Americans—which include songs about the school-girl fetish and the familial push to attend medical school. Riggs said the examples were drawn from her own bi-racial heritage, as well as feedback she received from her previous show, Kate’s-Chink-O-Rama.
When asked about the motivation behind the show, Rigg cited the lack of Asian-American role models in the media—a trend that perpetuates stereotypes.
For Rigg, educating college students about this issue is crucial.
“Culture is an absolute luxury, which is why it’s up to the younger generation, the college-aged, to change the face of Asian-Americans in the media,” Rigg said.
Around 60 people attended the event, according to Athena L.M. Lao ’12, co-chair of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association (AAA).
“Her words trigger experiences I’ve definitely felt before,” said attendee Yvonne Ting, Director of Administrative Technology Services at Smith College.
Ting added that she watched Slanty Eyed Mama’s performance because the duo’s show at Smith had been cut short by a fire alarm.
The performance was co-sponsored by nine cultural, artistic, or sexuality-related student groups. According to Lao, the event reached AAA’s aim not only to collaborate with other communities while raising awareness, but also to give voice to subgroups.
The sponsoring organizations included the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, Radcliffe Union of Students, Girlspot, Asian American Women’s Association, and H-BOMB, and was assisted by the Office for the Arts, Harvard College Women’s Center, and American Repertory Theatre.
The duo’s tour continues Nov. 6 at DePaul University.

More than a year after his death in a car accident, Biostatistics Professor Stephen W. Lagakos was honored at an all-day memorial symposium last Friday.
The event was sponsored by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Department of Biostatistics, the Harvard University Center for AIDS Research, and The New England Journal of Medicine.
Attendees gathered at the Joseph B. Martin Conference Center on the Harvard Medical School campus to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Lagakos, the late international leader in biostatistics and AIDS research.
The day’s events included presentations from biostatisticians, physicians, and health scientists—many of whom were Lagakos’ Harvard colleagues—on the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, the future of quantitative sciences, and other topics in scientific research.
Lagakos died on Oct. 12, 2009, in Peterborough, N.H., after swerving his 2002 Toyota Highlander into oncoming traffic, hitting a Chevy Malibu. The collision also led to the death of Lagakos’ wife and mother, as well as the driver of the other car.
According to onlookers quoted in USA Today, Lagakos, who was 63 years old, had been “driving like a man on fire.”
After the crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigated whether the deaths were caused by the sudden acceleration problems attributed to alleged safety defects in Toyota cars, though the model that Lagakos was driving was not on the list of recalled vehicles.
Earlier this year, government investigators reported that in 58 field inspections of Toyota-manufactured vehicles, they found no safety defects that would cause out-of-control acceleration.
According to Biostatistics Professor Nan M. Laird, the memorial event was held more than a year after Lagakos’ death due to the logistics of organizing such a large event—not because of the controversy surrounding the fatal accident.
Laird added that the symposium enabled colleagues to “see many different sides of Steve Lagakos. I’d known Steve for 30 years, and I learned things about him I never knew.”
The symposium ended with a dinner in Lagakos’ honor, where about 100 of the late professor’s colleagues shared stories about Lagakos. A slide show picturing Lagakos played on a screen throughout the sentimental talk.
At the end of the night, Biostatistics Department Chair Victor De Gruttola said he found the symposium to be a fitting way to honor Lagakos’ memory. “I think that the symposium really has brought together a very strong and committed group of scientists who, in sharing their research interests and passions, evoke the very best of Steve’s legacy,” De Gruttola said.

Food Literacy Project representatives lent a green thumb and a helping hand yesterday at a local elementary school to CitySprouts, a Cambridge non-profit.
The Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services’ FLP members spent the afternoon at Graham and Parks Alternative Public School as part of a workday designed to prepare the school’s garden for winter.
The event was hosted by CitySprouts, an organization that provides “sustainable schoolyard gardens and related programs for the Cambridge public schools.”
FLP representatives, all of whom are undergraduates, used their time at Graham and Parks tending to strawberries, lemon balm, mint, and squash, in addition to composting plants that would not survive the winter and covering the garden with hay. Parent volunteers and middle school students were also in attendance.
FLP Director Dara B. Olmsted ’00 said that FLP had never done a workday with CitySprouts, but that it was in line with the project’s commitment to community service.
“It’s also a fun bonding experience for the reps,” Olmsted added.
“I’m pretty excited to be here. It’s a lot of fun to work in the dirt and nice to be in the community,” FLP representative Gary D.J. Gerbrandt ’14 said as he worked in the garden.
Adeline S. Rolnick ’12, a FLP member who is interested in the technological development of agriculture, said she enjoyed the opportunity to both educate peers and volunteer in the community.
E. Louise Forest, the CitySprouts Garden Coordinator for Graham and Parks, noted that the Harvard students were a valuable asset.
“The impact of students from Harvard is huge,” Forest said. “Rarely [do we] have that kind of quality of help.”
Forest also emphasized the importance of educating elementary school students about food.
“A lot of kids have never seen how carrots and garlic grow,” Forest said. “[CitySprouts] helps them understand where food comes from.”
CitySprouts was founded 10 years ago by Jane S. Hirschi, a Cambridge mother, who is now the current Executive Director. Today, CitySprouts has a garden in every public elementary school in Cambridge.
Forest said the Cambridge-based organization is also working with the Cambridge Public School District’s Science Department to integrate learning about CitySprouts into the science curriculum.
One of the garden spaces at Graham and Parks Alternative Public School that was transformed by CitySprouts cost $10,000 to make into a usable space for the entire school, according to Forest. Now the space hosts a number of raised-bed gardens.
“[It is] a peaceful and beautiful space that gives life for the whole school,” Forest said.
FLP plans to participate in another CitySprouts workday this spring.
