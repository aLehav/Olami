After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a rare treat when audience members can exit an avant-garde film screening without thinking, “What the hell was that?” At best, one might appreciate the film’s aesthetics, while never fully grasping the artist’s intentions.  However, this past weekend at the Harvard Film Archive, avant-garde cinema pioneer Ken Jacobs screened film after film, answering questions to help clarify his artistic objectives. The evening was an unexpected trip into the visionary brilliance, or insanity, of Jacobs.Jacobs, who has paved the way for avant-garde cinema since the early 1950s, backs up an abstract way of thinking with knowledge of and experience with the mediums of film, digital video, and even 3-D. His groundbreaking use of overlapping footage from an early 20th century film in his 1969 film “Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son” marked him as a genius in the world of avant-garde cinema. “I am a creature of impulse,” Jacobs said. “I believe in the subconscious—I think of things in my sleep, and, in keeping with what I want, I go for it.” Delivering on that promise, the films screened last weekend reflected an appreciation for spontaneity and innovation.  “I was amused by making a kind of ‘jazz’ film,” Jacobs said in reference to his 1964 work “Window.” “A film that was made in the camera. No editing—a truthful film.” The short film is 16 minutes of pure silence, made with an 8mm camera that shifts dramatically, zooms in and out, and never focuses on its subject, a window that overlooks the Brooklyn Bridge. While this film might normally leave viewers perplexed, the audience last weekend received full enlightenment from the artist himself. Jacobs identified “Window” as an example of the unedited “jazz” thinking, which results in a film based solely on its aesthetic qualities. Jacobs explained this focus on his vision, citing 20th century artists such as Picasso and Warhol as part of his inspiration. The 8mm used in “Window” flattens the screen and makes the image look like a grainy, flat canvas. He believes this piece emulates the medium of painting.“This film is supposed to be like an abstract impressionist painting,” Jacobs said. “Yet, it doesn’t superficially imitate it.” Another inspiration is his wife, Flo, who also appeared with him at Harvard last weekend. Flo is Jacobs’ creative partner, and he accredited much of his current success to her help. “She’s my star—even when she doesn’t appear,” mused Jacobs with a smile. “She substantiates me—I work because she’s around.” However, one day in 1964, when Jacobs brought home a pair of “See TV in 3-D” glasses that he had purchased for one dollar at a local drugstore, Flo’s confidence in her husband wavered for a moment.  “More magic beans, Ken?” she asked. But those glasses unlocked a whole new world of cinema for Jacobs, leading to the next masterpiece he revealed to the audience, a 1990 film entitled “Opening the 19th Century: 1896.” In this film, Jacobs manipulated a collection of footage that had been filmed from a moving train by the Lumière brothers in 1896, constructing an entirely different visual experience. By asking the audience to cover their right (and then left) eyes with a light filter, the world of 1896 transformed into 3-D. “Most films feel they need to tell stories, but almost in every case I feel disappointed,” Jacobs explained. “The power of 3-D is usually squandered.” The non-narrative discovery that Jacobs made in “Opening the 19th Century: 1896” ignited a new mission for him: creating the impression of a 3-D film without actually using the standard light filters.With this objective in mind, Jacobs designed what he calls his Nervous Magic Lantern. The lantern is comprised of two projectors with identical film strips shown out of sync by one or more frames. This allows the filmmaker to hold and manipulate one frame for as long as he wishes. With the addition of a spinning shutter before and between the projectors, there is a constant flicker that reveals an unclear image in the middle of a strobe-light blur. For the 2005 movie “Krypton is Doomed,” the final film screened, Jacobs explained that the Nervous Magic Lantern and a 3x3 inch photograph of a painting were his only tools in creating the 34-minute film. Although there was no computer-processing, the image on-screen clearly transcended both the second and third dimensions, just as the artist intended.Through his film, Jacobs strives to create new territory, new inventions. More than just an avant-garde filmmaker, he has defied expectations and created worlds from little pieces of reality. “This is a calling,” Jacobs said. “And one has an obligation to fulfill that gift.” —Staff writer Noël D.

n Sanders Theatre this past Friday, cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 showed off his exuberant stage presence—with and without his instrument. Ma was joined onstage by President Drew G. Faust, Humanities Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt, and Literature Professor Diana Sorensen, who heaped praise on Ma for his talent and character as they announced new Harvard initiatives in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on the Arts. Introduced by Faust as “the beautiful Yo-Yo Ma,” Ma performed an awe-inspiring rendition of the Sarabande from Bach’s first cello suite and animatedly discussed his life in the arts. Although he admitted that he can’t carry a tune without an instrument, he explained the value of sharing and communicating an emotional connection with music instead of teaching and learning notes in a strict one-way fashion.After closing with a call for global empathy, he even provided career advice for Harvard students who are passionate about the arts but fear they lack the intrinsic talent to make it in the art world: “I think the important thing is to never lose your passion,” Ma explained. “It’s a rare gift to have one, and every profession is competitive—keep doing it, keep it alive.”After the talk, Ma sat down with The Crimson for 10 minutes to discuss his time at Harvard, his passion for people, and the massive undertaking of the Task Force for the Arts.The Harvard Crimson: Why did you pick Harvard originally, and not a music school?Yo-Yo Ma: I had played cello for quite a long time. And I knew that I wasn’t ready for the profession. I knew I wasn’t mature enough to do anything in music. I knew nothing about the world, I knew I needed to learn stuff, and I needed time. So I thought, “Wow—a university, what a great thing to do, what a great opportunity.” So I came here and I was a music major, but my great passion was anthropology.THC: Did you ever consider not going into music full time? Maybe going into anthropology?YYM: Absolutely. I always thought that I should do something other than music, because I always did music, and it was part of my life. I have a good friend, Emanuel Ax, who said to me, “Yo-Yo, you’ve just got to stop thinking that your profession is an interruption of your life.” Music is part of my life, but there’s a life separate from my life as a musician, and that actually is more of my identity. It wasn’t until five years ago that I realized that my real passion is people.THC: So maybe you would have been a politician?YYM: No. No! I would not be a politician. I love people, but politicians deal with the outside measurements of people. I like to deal with the inside measurements of people. That’s the role of culture. I think I would have been involved in culture in some way, whether as a teacher, as a social worker, or as something, but not as a politician. THC: I think you’ve ended up incredibly involved in culture.YYM: In the end, yes, but it’s only in the last maybe five years that I’ve come to a certain realization that basically I should do the things that I care about the most. And music, I realized, was a wonderful way to be able to fulfill all the different ways that I’m curious about people, about habits, about why people act the way they do. It’s a form of study, and I believe greatly not so much in creativity, but in finding the preconditions of creativity. So what Harvard is starting to do in the arts is a substantial interest. Obviously the administration is really behind it, and now it’s up to all of you to pick it up and get the ball rolling.THC: Do you think that a passion for the arts can really be taught here?YYM: It’s not about teaching, it’s about creating the environment and getting a critical mass of interested people to create enough sparks that things start to happen. If you have 500 disparate groups, that’s not a commitment to arts. Yes, you let things happen, but how do we do that? That’s in discussion with the student body, with FAS, with the administration; all the stakeholders have to be there.THC: It’s hard to get everybody together around here.YYM: Absolutely. That’s the struggle. You need the will, you need the resources, you need the people to really do that. And it sounds like the administration has the will. In these challenging times, imagination is free, passion is free. So these are our resources—we might as well use them.—Staff writer Benjamin C. Burns can be reached at bcburns@fas.harvard.edu.

“I’m thinking,” schoolteacher Leon Tolchinsky says. Doctor Zubritsky, the hapless Kulyenchikov resident whose daughter Tolchinsky must educate, responds in earnest.“What’s it like?” he asks. Strange as it may seem, Zubritsky’s question is no joke. He inquires in all seriousness, with a note of wonder and curiosity, because he is incapable of thinking. In Neil Simon’s “Fools,” performed with great enthusiasm by The F.U.D.G.E. Theatre Company at The Factory Theatre in Boston, the residents of an old Russian village called Kulyenchikov are forever condemned to a life of stupidity. Thanks to a 200-year-old curse, Kulyenchikov is a place where flowers are known as fish and fourteen sheep equal two dozen until Tolchinsky arrives and attempts to reverse this affliction of idiocy. While “Fools” is certainly not Simon’s finest work, F.U.D.G.E.’s production balances the script’s failing attempt at humor with wonderful, nuanced performances, charming creative vision, and a healthy dose of lighthearted fun.Tolchinsky (Nate Johnson) must educate Sophia Zubritsky (Jamianne Devlin) in 24 hours or risk falling victim to the village’s curse of stupidity. Unfortunately for Tolchinsky, he falls in love with the beautiful, but extremely dim-witted, Sophia. The lack of chemistry between Johnson and Devlin makes the asinine love story feel even more implausible than originally written, but the individual performances of the two actors easily compensate for this weakness. Johnson is especially delightful, playing Tolchinsky with an endearing earnestness, a wry sense of humor, and a weary, yet acute awareness of his ludicrous situation. After his character fails his mission and becomes brainless, Johnson’s entire physicality changes, making for some of the funniest non-spoken moments of the show. As the straight-faced man, Johnson may have the most difficult job in a play otherwise filled with absurd, broadly-played comedic characters, but he handles the portrayal with ease and a unique brand of wit and ingenuity.Among the ridiculous and idiotic, Steven Dyer might have the flashier role with his over-the-top Count Gregor Yousekevitch, but it is the Zubritsky parents, Lenya (Dorothy Ahle) and the Doctor (Peter Cosmas Sofronas), who nearly steal the show. The two share an effortless rhythm and sharp comedic timing that help them pull off some of the more absurd one-liners and gags. All of the actors use convincing Russian accents throughout the show, transforming some throw-away lines into comedic gold based solely on delivery.Director Joe DeMita’s set design brings the audience into the Zubritsky’s living room, with its goofy floral couch—where young Sophia learns how to sit down before our very eyes—and a door that transitions the other half of the stage into Kulyenchikov’s marketplace. A balcony center stage allows for a comical sequence between Sophia and Tolchinsky that parodies “Romeo & Juliet.” DeMita makes the most of the theatre’s limited space, adding varying levels and colorful accents to keep the show visually dynamic. His lively directing takes advantage of the intimate, crammed stage, providing the audience with aesthetically appealing details from nearly every angle.Less varied than the set, the light design by James Petty is nevertheless successful when it departs from the typical bright yellow glow of day used throughout most of the show. Tolchinsky’s deadpan asides to the audience are lit by a single spotlight, later used to effectively highlight the lack of internal thought processes by the shepherdess Snetskaya (AnneMarie Alvarez). Rare moments of clarity or strong emotion—such as Sophia’s wish to break free or Tolchinsky’s recognition of his love for Sophia—are accentuated by soft blues and fiery reds.DeMita keeps the show quickly paced, throwing gag after gag at the audience and seeing what sticks. His direction is smart in this way, helping the more clunky jokes fall by the wayside rather than linger. The audience barely has time to figure out a character’s twisted logic or groan at a crude one-liner before the play races off to the next non sequitur. Despite a script that at times seems more like a silly Mel Brooks slapstick farce than a clever Neil Simon fable, F.U.D.G.E.’s “Fools” thrives in the other aspects of its production. The cast is joyous and energetic, but perhaps smarter material would give them an even better chance to demonstrate their many talents. —Staff writer Ali R.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andre the Giant, Barack Obama, Andy Warhol, Flavor Flav, Noam Chomsky, and the dollar bill have one thing in common: at different points in time they have all been made into a Shepard Fairey image. A street artist whose mixture of black, red, white, and, most recently, blue in stylized swaths makes his images instantly recognizable to the initiated, Fairey has peppered the walls of buildings, electrical boxes, and street signs for the past 20 years with stickers and posters. The text accompanying the images dares the observer to “obey,” seeking to prompt passersby to question the world, and especially the institutions, around him. 
Despite his pervasive presence on street signs around America, it wasn’t until the 2008 presidential election that Fairey slingshotted onto the national stage with his creation of the now iconic, red, white, and blue Obama poster. Yet as Shepard Fairey goes from underground to mainstream, and from street to gallery, is his message getting muddled?
THE BOMBING OF BOSTON
Over the course of the last few weeks, the red-bricked walls of Harvard Square—along with its shiny metal surfaces—have been hit. Plastered within an archway on an outside wall of The Garage, a Muslim woman totes a gun with a flower in its barrel. Next to The Gap on Brattle Street, a woman decked in roses stares. Variously themed red, white, and black stickers have also been cropping up in the Square, all adorned with Fairey’s signature image of Andre the Giant and all with the same imperative: Obey.
The works arrived in the Square in conjunction with the street artist’s first solo show, “Shepard Fairey: Supply and Demand,” at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, the first solo show of any street artist in a U.S. museum.
The exhibition, which opened last Saturday and runs through August 16, displays over 250 posters, stencils, stickers, rubyliths, and ephemera made by Fairey and members of his studio over the course of the past two decades. Divided into seven themed rooms—Propaganda, War and Peace, Stylized, Music, Portraiture, Hierarchies of Power, and Question Everything—the works trace the evolution of his experiment and its influences through punk rock disobedience, skate culture, pop art, politics, propaganda, and capitalism. A glossary of terms on the exhibition pamphlet, itself designed as a piece of advertising, includes words ranging from “Appropriate” to “Culture Jamming,” indicating the disparate backgrounds of visitors to the show, as well as the mixture of “fine art” and “street art” in Fairey’s work.
“A lot of people are much better than I am at making pretty pictures,” Fairey says. Instead of focusing on aesthetics alone, his work stems from a desire to make people think harder about the authority figures to which they submit and the systems in which they operate. “People tend to follow the path of least resistance,” Fairey says. “‘Obey’ is offensive to their sense of independence. It makes them question.” 
TOO LEGIT TO QUIT
Boston was the first city Fairey bombed (“to paint, sticker or post many surfaces in one area” according to the ICA’s “OBEY” brochure) while an undergraduate at the Rhode Island School of Design in the early 90s. His work was also brought onto the Harvard campus two years ago by Susan Dackerman, curator of prints at the Fogg Art Museum, in conjunction with the show “Dissent!,” which focused on the use of printing to express protest and subversive messages. Though none of Fairey’s works appeared within the museum’s galleries, it was part of advertising efforts on behalf of “Dissent!” The show’s organizers covered Harvard Yard and the surrounding area with posters for the exhibition emblazoned with Fairey’s Obey stickers. “We wanted to demonstrate that the street was an important part of the kind of work we were putting on in the galleries,” Dackerman says.
Fairey and the ICA’s choice to put up work in outdoor locations throughout the Greater Boston area as part of “Supply and Demand” points to a similarly rooted desire.
“You lose a lot of the elements of the dialogue that the work is in on the street, so the work is no longer in juxtaposition to graffiti and billboards and street signs and traffic signs that create either an harmonious or discordant environment,” Dackerman says. “When [Fairey] realized it was going to be in a gallery he had to complicate images....added] pieces of newspaper and advertisements to create a dialogue internal to the work that on the street is a much more public dialogue.”
[He added] pieces of newspaper and advertisements to create a dialogue internal to the work that on the street is a much more public dialogue.”
The image of the “Muslim Woman,” for example, pasted in a bricked-up eave of The Garage stands in close proximity to a graffitied iron gate and the faded, stained-glass windows of John Harvard’s. The juxtaposition is subtly ironic, as the antiquated windows adopt cultural figures of their own—John F. Kennedy’s head, for one, is cropped onto a saint’s body, with “Ask not what your country can brew for you, ask what you can brew for your country” below. The interplay between Fairey’s work and the preexisting environment reveals the complexities involved in the display of street art.
Within the ICA’s walls, Fairey used mixed media to preserve nuance as his art moved from street to gallery. Glimpses of newspaper and posters show through the paint, complicating the work’s more overt messages. Standing beneath his largest inside work to date, which the ICA commissioned for “Supply and Demand,” Fairey said, “It combines the scale and presence of street art with the depth of what I call fine art.” Countering questions with a humor that also contains a certain biting honesty, he says of the difference between “fine art” and street art, “When it’s on canvas, then it’s fine art, right? I think there are some brushstrokes and drips somewhere.”
This “more refined depth,” these brushstrokes and drips that Fairey says he adds to prints intended for sale in galleries, are the result of a freedom from the time constraints of the street, where Fairey runs the risk of arrest if he dallies too long. The artist has been arrested 15 times, most recently right as he was about to enter the ICA last Friday on his way to DJ part of their Experiment series. The outstanding warrants for vandalism on which he was arrested and his constant drive to bomb cities he visits have helped to maintain his street credibility as some of his original fans feel more and more distanced from his art. 
A number of these longtime fans now accuse Fairey of selling out as they feel less and less a part of a unique phenomenon. Over the course of the last 20 years, Fairey’s experiment has grown into Obey—a large company based out of Los Angeles that comprises a clothing line and a design studio. The clothing line has become more mainstream (it’s being sold locally in Urban Outfitters), and his design studio, Studio Number One, has contributed to advertising campaigns for Saks Fifth Avenue and Toyota. For these disenfranchised fans, Obey is taking on the unsavory glow of “radical chic.”
Michael C. Soto ’09 says that such a backlash is inevitable in the world of independent art. “There is a temptation to feel slighted in some way by people who have a high regard for street element. But it’s great for not only them but for art and people outside of art.” Soto continues, “I feel like it’s coming from people who feel like they were losing something that was special and only for them.”
Soto cites Fairey’s generosity to charities as being among the factors that save him from the same degree of condemnation with which other more avaricious artists have met. The sale of limited edition posters on his website for as little as $20, despite the fact that he could easily inflate prices to match going rates of his work on ebay, is another sign that he has made an effort not to lose touch with his roots. 
Dackerman also argues that Fairey’s commercial work should not necessarily be seen as detracting from his art. “I don’t think his commercial work undermines his other work; it supports it; it enables it to happen. The commercial work sometimes mirrors the street work but actually gets within the corporate structure.” 
Addressing the reason why corporations might want to take on the images of an artist who was best known for his subversive, anti-establishment stance prior to the Obama campaign, Dackerman says, “I don’t think that Saks actually loses anything by circulating that kind of subversive imagery, and it makes Saks look hipper and cooler than it usually does.”
WHO DID IT?
In 2008, Fairey made a series of prints depicting then presidential hopeful Barack Obama in shades of red, white, and blue with the word “Progress” printed below him as an expression of Fairey’s support for the candidate. Within days, posters had spread all over the internet and the streets. The Obama campaign soon contacted Fairey about making the image an official art of the campaign and changing its tagline from “PROGRESS” to “HOPE.”
“Wherever I went in little towns in Ohio, posters by Shepard Fairey, and other artists, were everywhere,” says Rose Styron, a political poet and current fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics who canvassed in the swing state during the campaign. According to Styron, the poster had a tangible, positive affect on her and on fellow campaigners. “It gave us conviction that Obama’s message could be conveyed to young people, a feeling that this was possible.”
The Obama poster was a key moment not only in the campaign, but in Fairey’s artistic oeuvre as well. It marked a transformation from political dissident to supporter of a constructive message—the volunteer creator of the presidential election’s most iconic image.
Ironically, Fairey’s work has itself become an instrument of political satire. The website Obamaicon.me, on which anyone can create an image in the mold of Obama’s poster, has increased the presence of his stylized imagery as students replace Fairey’s image with their own, appropriating his creation for humorous ends, decorations and House Council campaigns. However, most are unaware of the work’s provenance outside the presidential campaign.
Christi E. Morrissey ’10, whose “dark horse” Adam’s House Council campaign also played off of World War II era Uncle Sam posters geared towards recruiting, used the Obamaicon.me website to transform an image of herself in Naval ROTC gear. “My whole campaign was based off of spoofing iconic images,” Morrissey says.    
In the poster, she stands in full combat attire with gun raised, unknowingly evoking an image of Fairey’s own in which he depicts a combat-ready soldier. “I actually didn’t find out where [the Obama image] came from...until I tried to make it myself,” Morrissey says. “I actually don’t think that a lot of people know where it came from. I think a lot of people think that it was created by the campaign for the campaign. It’s the work of art that’s become famous, not necessarily the artist.” 
X’s and O’s
Outside the Tannery, the eyes of the mural have been X’ed out in marker; on an axle of the Obey symbol, someone has written “intentional?” with an arrow pointedly aimed at a misplaced seam, suggesting an ambiguous reception to the work. Even as the perpetrators express differing degrees of animosity towards Fairey’s work, they are caught in the catch-22 underlying all he does. Knowingly or not, they obey his command: they are questioning.—Staff writer Anna K. Barnet can be reached at abarnet@fas.harvard.edu.

The 26-year-old teacher of Harvard’s newest music class doesn’t notice students coming in as he discreetly dances to Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies.” Playing from his iPod, the song fills the room. When class starts, he stops dancing—for the most part, at least—but the iPod never goes away.The students of this music class are more likely to study Bob Dylan and Michael Jackson than Beethoven and Mozart. In fact, Backstreet Boys is on the syllabus too.“How Songs Work” is a non-credit seminar led for the first time this Spring by Adams House resident songwriter and tutor, Matthew J. Coriel ’05. The class meets every other Monday in the Coolidge Room of Adams House. Over the course of six seminars, Coriel hopes to give students the tools necessary to appreciate and understand popular music in a more analytical and nuanced way.“We don’t all go to the ballet. We don’t all go to the symphony,” he says. “But all of us have songs on our iTunes playlists. We all listen to music but know almost nothing about how it’s made.”This “modest little series,” as Coriel calls it, is designed for anyone—with or without a musical background—who wants to better understand the function of the various elements of a song. Although the first class included a fair number of aspiring student lyricists, the focus of the course will be on listening, rather than on writing.“Once you have an understanding of what goes into making these songs and how they reveal themselves, you get more out of it,” says Coriel. “Even the stuff on the radio.”To prove his point, Coriel plays “I Want it That Way” by the Backstreet Boys to open the class. As a handful of people sing along under their breath, Coriel explains its cyclical structure and demonstrates how listeners must project their own experiences onto the lyrics in order to connect with the song.In the eyes of the students, Coriel’s class fills a void in the current curricular offerings. “There’s no actual classes in songwriting or on popular music in the music department,” says Daniel A. Masterson ’12. “Just being able to do it with some advising is pretty cool.”Though the course is not affiliated with the Music Department or any other academic branch of the University, Coriel was inspired to create ”How Songs Work” in response to the proposals of the Task Force on the Arts. He decided to take the initiative to make a concrete step toward the goal of augmenting the arts at Harvard.This ambitious step has garnered much encouragement from members of the arts community. According to Coriel, he has received positive feedback from the Dramatic Arts and Literature Departments, as well as from Humanities Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt, chair of the Task Force on the Arts. Jack C. Megan, director of the Office for the Arts and a member of the Task Force, was especially pleased that Coriel decided to take action.“It’s exactly the kind of thing we were hoping for,” says Megan. “Our report was not the final declaration but in fact the beginning of a discussion of what the arts could be at Harvard. We were hoping it would spark creative thought in some of the most creative members of the community.”Especially at a time when Harvard’s financial standing is sure to delay some of the Task Force’s larger proposals, Coriel’s class proves that the University can still provide an innovative arts curriculum despite an economic downturn. “Of course the economy is impacting everything that this university is doing,” says Megan.  “But I think that continuing to seed new intensive, high impact engagements with teaching artists remains important.” Smaller initiatives like this seminar can maintain the momentum that the first report generated and provide students with new opportunities to interact with the art world.According to Megan, Harvard will host a number of artists in residence in the next few years. These professionals will take a page from Coriel’s book, teaching small seminars involving their craft. Executive director of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts and renowned double bassist, Edgar Meyer, will visit campus as early as this March. And last Friday President Faust announced that Harvard will also welcome Wynton Marsalis and John Adams as guests in coming years.Although “How Songs Work” signals a bright future for arts education at Harvard, the future of the class itself is still undetermined. Coriel would like to continue to offer it next year, perhaps even spreading it across two semesters. His real goal, however, is to inspire the introduction of a similar class into the Music Department.“If we can create a precedent for a course like this happening and people being interested then maybe we can get Harvard to get the real people to teach it,” he says.Although he was cautious about how soon a class like this might be created, Megan agrees. “Composition is already a significant part of what happens in the music department,” he says. “I would be optimistic that in time, the creation of lyrics could be as well.”“But I don’t know if that means we’ll ever have a Professor Beyoncé Knowles on the faculty,” he warned.Until then, we’ll just have to settle for the Matt Coriel version of the “Single Ladies” dance.—Staff writer Charlton A.

I have become something of an encyclopedia of sandwich knowledge. I can tell the difference between a standard French Dip and a double-dipped. I can order a Philly Cheesesteak the right way: “wit” or “wit-out” (onions). I know where the po-boy was invented (New Orleans 1929), and the most popular sandwich in America (the hamburger). The bad news is that classes have started again, so I don’t have time to watch a whole PBS documentary about sandwiches. The good news is that if I did, it’d be my third time. I don’t even particularly like sandwiches. I just wanted to settle, once and for all, the debate raging over the Adams House email list: Is a wrap a sandwich? The question, credited to Chinh Vo ’09, set off a heated, house-wide argument when Kathleen Chen ’09 unleashed it on the Schmooze at the beginning of exam period. Omar Abdelsamad ’09, the former House Committee Co-Chair, was the first to weigh in: “I’m going to open this up by saying absolutely not. A sandwich has strict criteria and a wrap meets neither the bread nor the positioning requirements (bread, filling, bread, top to bottom) that make up a sandwich.” As exam period delirium intensified, the list exploded and the house divided into sandwich radicals, liberals and purists. The purists accepted only the traditional two-slice model; they held the ‘wich up to the triangle test—if it could be cut into a triangle, it was good enough to be called a sandwich. The moderate liberals rejected the wrap and its cylindrical cousins (the burrito and the spring roll), but accepted the open-faced sandwich and the decidedly non-triangular bagel/rollwich. The radicals, on the other hand, accepted anything stuffed in carbs as a sandwich; in addition to wraps, burritos, quesadillas and hot dogs were welcomed into the fold.In the height of the battle, Adams awoke one morning to find itself plastered in Magritte-inspired signs—a picture of a wrap sliced in two, arranged like a pipe, with “Ceci n’est pas un sandwich,” scrawled below. Thank you, anonymous artist, for giving me the perfect response to, “So, what’s Harvard really like?”“O RLY” was the liberals’ appropriate, if snarky, reply. Over the next two weeks, the emails that flew over the list included a reference to the Supreme Court case Panera Bread Co. v. Qdoba Mexican Grill (2006); input from a house chef; a rick-roll’d link; repeated reminders to please don’t forget to study for your tests; talk of “genus” and “species” and “would a wrap and a sandwich have fertile offspring?”; a mock Bible passage; and a voting platform designed by a computer science concentrator. The results? 41 said no, a wrap is not a sandwich, 22 said yes.I had stayed uncharacteristically silent on the “Epic Argument” forum. Honestly, I found the whole argument entirely absurd. The lowly sandwich hardly seemed to merit this fervor. But as resident food columnist, I figured it was my duty to uncover the definition of “sandwich” and restore order to the residences on Plympton Street. The task seemed simple enough when I set out to Schlesinger Library, but I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Determining whether a wrap qualified as a sandwich was only the beginning. That mystery was solved in the first hour of scrolling through a mountain of Food Encyclopedias and American Food History books. I’m sorry purist friends, the wrap is in fact a sandwich. According to the definitive Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America, “During the 1990s, wraps became a popular new form of sandwich in the United States.” Sandwich was cross-referenced to “Wraps,” as wrap was cross-referenced to “Sandwiches.” Mystery solved. But the quest seemed incomplete; the answer seemed too easy to procure. If the definition was so easy to find, why did the original wrap v. sandwich question become so epic in the first place? Sure we Adamsians were bored because it was exam period and we neewwded an excuse to procrastinate, and sure there is an interesting semantic issue to be explored, but the explosion on the list spoke to a debate that was more than just a time-killer or an argument about definitions. Wrap v. sandwich called into question an entire culinary history as well as our own personal histories. We all have a favorite sandwich or a childhood memory at stake in the outcome. If a quesadilla can be considered a sandwich, what would that mean for our memories?  My lack of closure stemmed from the fact that knowing the definition didn’t compare to the satisfaction of biting into a juicy pastrami on rye. I spoke to everyone I knew to recover the charm missing from Oxford’s “sandwich (n.)”. Suddenly, I was in a world where everyone else was a secret sandwich expert and I would never possibly know enough. My friend from Long Island, a connoisseur of Boston’s roast beef sandwiches, gave me alarmingly detailed accounts of various sandwich shops. Another friend described the “Fat Bitch,” which far and away takes the prize for—I don’t know, something. Originating in a grease truck on Rutgers’ campus, it contains a hearty portion of Cheesesteak, chicken fingers, two sticks of string cheese, mayonnaise, ketchup, lettuce and tomato heaped onto Italian bread. Oh and French Fries too. The Fat Bitch fanboy later confessed that he was the one who had asked Widener to purchase the PBS sandwich documentary.Five sandwich-filled dreams later, I realized I had crossed over to the other side. My inability to control my research was like the Schmooze’s inability to contain itself on the forum. It was a testament to how integral the sandwich is to all our lives—whether or not we stop to think about it. What had started as a simple definitional question had sprawled into an epic exploration of our collective obsession with the sandwich. So, yes Adams, the wrap is a sandwich. And yes, an analysis so complicated for a dish so simple may seem ridiculous. But I dare you not to care about it. —Columnist Rebecca A. Cooper can be reached at cooper3@fas.harvard.edu.

As photographer Rosamond Purcell understands it, a common misconception plagues the relationship between scientists and artists: when these two fields interact, “an artist is regarded as a bull in a china shop,” Purcell says. However, two photography exhibits currently on display at the Harvard Museum of Natural History—Purcell’s “Egg and Nest” and Amanda Means’ “Looking at Leaves”—demonstrate the way that artists can reveal the aesthetics of the natural world, rather than simply record scientific data about it.“Each of the photography exhibitions that we have done has been designed to raise different questions about the way we see the world and to attract new audiences,” says Elisabeth Werby, the executive director of HMNH. “They are meant to be intriguing and provocative exhibitions.”Purcell, who has frequented natural history museums for years, also collaborated with the late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould on three books (including “Crossing Over Where Art and Science Meet”). She is living proof that interdisciplinary researchers not only exist, but can apply different insight to an object of study.Purcell believes that an artist and a scientist can make a “powerful team”; yet she makes the distinction between a scientist and a natural historian, the latter of which relies more on observation than experimentation to come to conclusions about the natural world.“There is a dialogue that can be had between an artist and a historian of science,” she says. “I don’t think [the two fields] should be conflicting. The angles of view that an artist can bring to bear are equally as valid as those that a scientist can bear.” However, Purcell admits that despite her frequent collaborations with natural historians, she has encountered difficulties in attempting to reconcile her approach with scientists’ when depicting biological collections.“Egg and Nest,” Purcell’s latest exhibition, opened yesterday. It will be on display through March 15. The exhibition features images of the eggs and nests of various bird species. Photographed from a collection of the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology in California, the pictures attempt to enhance the visual beauty of natural history collections. For example, they emphasize the aesthetic attributes of the eggs and nests, from their color to their architectural design.Though Werby believes that these photographs can be “windows into natural history,” she also admits that artists who depict objects in nature confront the unique challenge of distinguishing their works as art. Purcell says that once an artist has developed strategies to overcome this hurdle, she is then capable of bringing to life “visual, evocative qualities” in her subjects through artistic media. Thus she can illuminate aspects of an object in ways different from those achieved through scientific methodology.“I haven’t gone out to document what is just there,” Purcell says. “I photograph as an artist.”Her series is one of many examples that suggest the potential discourse between the arts and the sciences.Similarly, Amanda Means uses her photographs to aestheticize subject matter generally thought to reside only in the scientific realm. “Looking at Leaves” ended Feb. 8. The black and white photographs of the exhibit are products of scientific inquiry into the properties of leaves. Using her media, Means has enhanced nature to render it more visually striking; some of these dramatic and haunting photographs show leaves enlarged to the point of being unrecognizable. She also incorporated her subject matter into the artistic process, for example by placing the leaves in her camera and treating them as negatives.“These leaf images are at once very artistic and very scientific, but it is not something I consciously strive for,” writes Means in an email. “As a result of the... direction in my work, I have become very interested in learning more about the interactions of science and art.”“To put it another way, I am interested in the visual arts, and if something scientific is also visually very beautiful and intriguing, then it interests me.  The scientific realm is packed full of stunning and mysterious visual imagery,” Means writes.Werby notes that the creative liberties Means and other artists employ have introduced an alternative, yet equally valid interpretation of the natural world.“The point of Amanda Means is to make you think that this is not a leaf,” Werby says. “It’s fun to get artists looking at things that scientists might look at, and to see a different way of looking at them.”For Means, art and science coincide harmoniously; there is no true division between the two discourses. Referring to the anatomical drawings of Leonardo da Vinci, which she found at once artistic and scientific, Means says the study of both fields is essential to a more profound understanding of the intricacies that govern “the rhythms of nature.”“I don’t feel there is a conflict. [They] are all parts of the same thing,” she says. “But if people do feel a conflict, I think the more they can gain a deep understanding of both art and of science, the more they will understand the similarities between the two.”—Staff writer Eunice Y.

When he’s not acting in Hasty Pudding burlesques, you might find W. Brian Polk hanging out with his pals from the improv group On Thin Ice or performing in comic operas with the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players; he’s also been spotted performing in several Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club shows. Polk—actor, singer, writer—has contributed an enormous amount of his time at Harvard to the arts. For Polk, theater isn’t just a passion; it’s an incredible community. The San Diego native first found his passion for acting when he began to perform in his local youth theater group at age 10, and he’s still in touch with many of the friends he made in his early acting days. At Harvard, Polk says, the theater scene has allowed him to form “relationships and friendships with some of the most amazing people he’s ever met.” His love of performing has affected every layer of his college experience, and although he is intrigued by the idea of a career in politics down the line, he is hoping to pursue acting or score a job as a comedy writer after he graduates.Despite the race to finish his History and Literature thesis about 1850s fugitive slave court cases in Boston and final rehearsals for “Acropolis Now,” the 161st show of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, which opens tonight, Polk agreed to meet with The Crimson to share a little bit more about his three years with HPT. The Harvard Crimson: What first attracted you to the Hasty Pudding Theatricals?W. Brian Polk: I didn’t know much about it when I arrived on campus, but as I became a sophomore I realized that I knew a lot of the Pudding crew, had worked with them or seen them in shows, and I thought they were all pretty cool and talented. I wanted to try it out and see what it was all about. I’m sort of a ham—very loud and presentational—so the Pudding was luckily right up my alley, too!THC: What was it like to both act and write for HPT? Any preference?WBP: I’m glad I have some experience under my belt as a writer, but I think I’m more of a performer. Maybe I like attention too much! Last year I was in the show, as well as writing it, which was a crazy experience. When I wasn’t rehearsing a scene, I would be brainstorming with the director: adding this joke, fixing this joke, trying things out. Rehearsal was a really full day, and it kept you busy. It was a tough job, but it’s really rewarding to hear people laugh at jokes that you’ve written, and it never stops to surprise you. It’s always amazing when people laugh at jokes you wrote, especially those written very quickly at, like, two in the morning.THC: Are those the funniest ones?WBP: Sometimes they are! Jokes that you thought were filler turn out to work really well, because the guys in the Pudding are so versatile and always come up with different ways to deliver lines. The cast makes you look good. It’s a collaborative process.  THC: Tell us more about “Acropolis Now.”WBP: It’s really good, better than last year’s show, and I say that with complete honesty. The music is wonderful with some very catchy tunes, and the show is brilliant. It takes place in Ancient Greece, and it’s about the first Olympics ever. There’s a demigod named Hugh Bris who has to win an athletic competition in order to become a full God. Hilarity ensues, conflict begins, and soul-mates are found. I play this character Brometheus, a frat guy who’s really into Greek life...That’s the big joke. I’m constantly inviting Gods to give me a fist bump. It’s fun.THC: Very manly! And what was it like playing a woman last year?WBP: That was a huge trip. I had huge hips, huge boobs, and played a magic mirror. I was supposed to be this big disco queen and really just looked like a giant disco ball! There are some really terrifying pictures on Facebook that I’m sure will ruin my political career someday.THC: Besides the embarrassing pictures, what’s the single best thing about performing in a drag show?WBP: It’s good because in an all-male cast, I’m not going to get distracted and fall in love with one of my fellow cast members. That’s not true for everyone in our crew though!THC: It’s your last Pudding Premiere on Friday... Reactions?WBP: Obviously it’s very exciting. The Pudding is such a great experience, weighed down with a lot of history, and I love how Harvard can take tradition and let students make it completely their own. That which is old is new again. In some ways, opening night is the beginning of a new journey. It’s the first of 37 performances. At the end of that is when I’ll probably cry. You eventually have to get kicked out though; they don’t let you stick around. I’ve built a lot of amazing friendships and amazing relationships through the Pudding. I’m sure I’ll be nostalgic all of senior spring, but I’m also ready to go.

“Life in Vilnius is a giant poker game, played by madmen.” “Vilnius Poker,” a novel by late Lithuanian author Ricardas Gavelis, and recently translated into English by Elizabeth Novickas, sets up a metaphorical card game to puzzle even the most seasoned players. With four narrators at the table, each of whom bluffs, bets, and folds accordingly, Gavelis conducts a profound autopsy of Lithuanian identity garroted by Soviet rule.  This ambitious endeavor is admirably achieved. Gavelis’ writing is a paragon of surrealist creativity and an intensely interesting read, filled with effortlessly intelligent prose and a wryly macabre voice.  What’s at stake in “Vilnius Poker” is the namesake city, Lithuania’s capital, which is first introduced through the eyes of the most fractured player at the table, Vytautas Vargalas.   Vargalas, a labor camp survivor turned librarian, serves as a paradigm for post-Soviet interstice.  He sees life through a lens of feverish paranoia, which makes his observations abundantly surreal and vividly eroticized, simultaneously reminiscent of Kesey and Orwell.  Through his eyes, Vilnius is “a dead city, and above it hangs a fog of submissive, disgusting fear.”  It has become a landscape “where Russia’s expansionism and Europe’s spirit went to war,” and one that has anticlimatically subsided into an achromatic wasteland. To Vargalas, Vilnius is the worst kind of hell—an inferno devoid of flames and full instead of gray—made in the likeness of its own architects, “Them.” “They” are the silent, gray majority of shapeless shadow beings that are inexorably draining Lithuanian life and stuffing it with emptiness. “They” are perceived by Vargalas alone, a result of his deep pathology: “When discovered, ‘They’ immediately change tactics… It’s impossible to surround ‘Them,’ to trap ‘Them’ in a corner, to push ‘Them’ up against the wall—it’s ‘They’ who surround you, who hold you in a siege like a live castle, whose walls, alas, are pathetically weak.”In this city of walking dead, Vargalas endures a lone struggle for survival.  This struggle is manifested in a search for vital signs of Lithuanian identity—a quest that’s fruitless until Vargalas stumbles headfirst into a live pulse: Lolita, the determinedly unchaste daughter of a brutal KGB colonel. In typical tragic fashion, a love story unfolds between the pair, but it becomes clear that Lolita is, like the rest of Lithuania, damaged goods—corrupted as much by the sinister “Them” as by her own submissive will.  In encountering Lolita, Vargalas’ fragile paranoia is thrown into violent imbalance, and he too falls subject to the same designs “They” have exacted on Lithuania—a torture ritual of castration, evisceration, and sterilization.  The most lasting surreality Vargalas experiences is a frozen city through which he alone moves, caught in a stillness that, he believes, allowed “Them” inside. Their fated romance echoes  Vilnius’ last breath of air, before it’s shut beneath the gray exterior of a Soviet sarcophagus.   The remaining three narrators are peripheral characters in Vargalas’ life—Martinas, a pontificating computer(less) programmer, Stefanija, a jealous and infertile seductress, and Gediminias, a brilliant mathematician turned jazz artist.  There is no dialogue among these characters, only isolated observations.  This completes the author’s metaphor of a poker game in which “everyone hides his cards, raises and raises the bet, grimaces and makes faces, hoping to deceive the others, but no one ever finds out what his cards really are.”While Martinas, Stefanija, and Gediminias each provide a more normalized account of Vargalas’ fragmented story; their contradicting observations suggest that Vargalas’ malaise is endemic to all of Vilnius. At times, the threesome seem to act together to introduce “Them,” an invisible main character and a foil for Vargalas (or Vilnius itself), even though none of them share in Vargalas’ paranoia. In subtle fashion, they point out three cards in Vargalas’ hand: sterility, impotence, and humanity.  And although it’s never clear what cards “They” hold, it’s evident that Vargalas’ hand is not strong enough to win.Of the four narrators, Vargalas has the most interesting hand at the table.  His narrative spans the majority of the book, and trains the reader to see Vilnius with Vargalas’ self-purported “second sight,” which pays no heed to physical realities, but is acutely aware of the ethereal presence of “Them.”  “I had never known the ordinary world that everyone sees,” he says.  “Vilnius Poker” is reluctant to disclose itself.  Gavelis leaves the reader to comb through its cryptic geographies—not unlike Vargalas’ own task—for elusive traces of truth that, when lined up, still appear mismatched.  The hunt is a fascinating one, and winds through a phantasmagoric suspension of reality that tumbles along chaotically in one moment only to freeze in the next.  This halting flow is a product of Gavelis’ own vivid and organic style, which takes a simultaneously sexualized and ebullient look at the human condition in a city that is ultimately at fault for “Their” presence. In doing so, Gavelis holds a mirror to Lithuania’s historical emasculation and inconsequentiality, and the national disenchantment that follows in its wake. A task of this weight and ambition, however, is not met easily. Gavelis’ quicksand-like prose, while in and of itself an effective literary device in the surrealist tradition, constitutes a difficulty in reading which can distract from the author’s immense talent. However, Gavelis’ narcotic narrative flow still manages to render this story’s surreality seamless, and “Vilnius Poker” is a fascinating read. —Staff writer Erin F.

Jayne Anne Phillips’ latest book, “Lark and Termite,” opens with an epigram from William Faulkner’s “The Sound and the Fury.” “Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.” It is a fitting borrowing in a number of ways—both books use the time span of four key days to piece together the meaning of family through four different points of view; both extensively utilize stream-of-consciousness style in order to do so; and both feature sons with mental retardation that gives way to a type of clairvoyance. Phillips gives an explicit nod of acknowledgment to Faulkner and the inevitable parallels readers will draw between them. However, there is a key difference. While Faulkner’s characters are riddled with vice that brings them to ruin, Phillips’ characters are more hopeful. While this makes “Lark and Termite” a less distressing read, its grip upon the imagination is sure to fade in comparison to Faulkner’s classic.The narrators in “Lark and Termite” are all introverted, insightful, and observant. What’s more, they are uniformly and oppressively good. The novel opens with the perspective of Corporal Robert Leavitt, father of the as-yet-unborn Termite (the portions that feature Leavitt occur on the same days as the other perspectives, but nine years before). Leavitt is an American soldier in South Korea who is devoted to his wife (read: does not have sex with prostitutes), and, ultimately, gives his life to protect a young Korean mother and her blind child from American fire. Lark and Termite are half-siblings through their mother, who dies before the narrative begins. Though 17, and just discovering her own sexuality for the first time, Lark is completely devoted to Termite’s care. She decides not to go to college so that she can stay and be “Termite’s mother, one of them.” Termite can only parrot words, not speak them, and has never cried, but his section of the book’s narration is imbued with an otherworldly clairvoyance.The most interesting perspective is that of Lark and Termite’s aunt, Nonie, who has effectively raised them. Nonie has taken pains to cover over the memory of her sister, a woman whom it seems was always more beloved than she was. Her attitude toward the children is constantly shifting, and she dribbles out her emotion in jaded comments. “Don’t ever let a man inside you,” she tells Lark, starting when Lark is only about nine years old. If Nonie was jealous of her sister, her story would have a little more depth. But it becomes clear that, deep down, Nonie cannot be jealous of a selfless gift (that of children)from her sister. The narrators on a whole are nauseatingly blameless, and in another novel a compelling plot would pick up the slack. However, in 250 pages, the only real plot points are a melodramatic unfurling of family lineage and a rain storm.Another syrupy note in sharp contrast to “The Sound and the Fury,” is the perspective from the previous generation. Corporal Leavitt, Termite’s father, makes his account almost a decade before the rest of the events of the book, an ocean away. His story draws to a close in South Korea precisely as Termite is being born in America. He has been shot in the spine and is dying in an underground tunnel, and his final thoughts are beautiful in their own respect. But his story serves only to explain Termite’s condition, as Leavitt’s dying vision becomes the telepathic stimulus for the images Termite draws. Termite’s back story gives him a sort of religious aura, the potency of which is explicated (and thereby diminished) when Lark says straight out, “From the beginning, I confused him with an angel, a good part of me that didn’t speak and wouldn’t talk in plain language.” An albino Social Service worker, literally invisible to the rest of society, appears to him in times of desperation. With a voice of many whispering sounds, bearing gifts such as a wheelchair and flowers, the albino serves the role of a not-so-subtle angel. Phillips’ conceit to render a mentally handicapped boy in a Christ-like light plumbs, anemically, into the same well as Faulkner’s Benjy. What separates Benjy from Termite is that Termite’s transcendental nature is flat and incompatible with the greater story, while Benjy’s presence is one that illuminates religious allegory. Even the poetic prose of his section lends Termite an elevating sense of omniscience. “He sits by the window and hears the faint roots of the grass in the berm of the alley, long veiny threads that reach deep in the ground to drink where no one sees.” These elements fail to indicate any deeper, more enlightening reading of the story, and since they are not sufficiently integrated into the plot, they stand out glaringly. And, for a novel following in Faulkner’s footsteps to mimic the human mind as closely as possible, such flat goodwill and deeply poetic style undermines Phillips’ very premise. It stands, not as an exposition on the human psyche, but one of human ideals. And this isn’t anything new.—Staff writer Rebecca A. Schuetz can be reached at schuetz@fas.harvard.edu.

“You’re not the first person I ever tried to impress with my brilliant performance of not really being impressed with anything.” In “The First Person,” Ali Smith’s most recent anthology of short stories, she examines the link between her characters’ past and present, their imagination and reality. Wrapped in the familiar and seemingly plain events of day-to-day goings-on, Smith exposes deep insights into these aspects of the human experience. There are few fantastic or bold statements inside the stories, but their simplicity only intensifies their impact. Through an intimate and engaging examination of her characters, Smith ties the reader to their tales of humor, heartbreak, and change.The stories move through a variety of lives, seen through the eyes of female narrators, leading up to the novel’s centerpiece, “The First Person,” an intimate look at a couple’s relationship. Smith’s prose flows freely through their conversation, eliminating quotation marks and explanation from the author in favor of a strong emotional connection with the reader. The barriers between writer and reader, fact and fiction are broken down. As the conversation between the two women unfolds, dream, memory and pure fiction find equal footing in the recollection of experience—that of the superfluous. “Or how about this? How about we’re story-free? How about, there is no story as to how we met?” one of the lovers says, asking how the past will play a role in our experience of the present. Equally enticing are Smith’s descriptions of the implausible, written in such an honest and frank manner that one begins to believe that happening upon a curly-haired baby spewing obscenities or a fourteen year-old version of yourself are as routine as a couple discussing opera or a phone call to a sick friend. In “Writ,” Smith’s protagonist confronts her childhood self at the dinner table, and struggles with the question of whether or not to divulge the details of her future. “I want to tell her who to trust and who not to trust; who her real good friends are and who’s going to fuck her over; who to sleep with and who definitely not to…But I look at her sitting there, thin and insolent and complete, and I can’t say any of it.”The past and the way it returns to us is a recurring theme throughout the book, suturing the stories to one another and focusing the reader’s attention on the characters’ simultaneous divergence and cohesion of experience. All of Smith’s characters share a common search for a sense of identity—a sense which can only be arrived at by a reflection on the past.  Smith’s stories of life’s everyday occurrences are at once both introspective and universal. Her characters remain totally ambiguous—they are roles in which readers are free to cast themselves. At the same time, Smith writes in a strongly personal style, and her voice is channeled through each of her stories’ characters. The intimate conversations between figures in the story feel almost autobiographical in their spare, evocative detail. She entwines the reader and author rather than delineating a separate role for each. This innovative tactic forges a close connection, one which is essential in the limited frame of a short story. Smith’s writing in this collection is honest and open—even in the span of 10 pages, readers may find themselves sympathizing deeply with a character. As she describes a late night phone call or an encounter with a nostalgic man at an empty bar, Smith makes the reader feel almost interchangeable with the characters she creates. The whispered secrets or shared laughter at once engage the reader and make them coy to look in at such intimate moments. Smith’s resonating intimacy and the role of the onlooker she assigns the reader force an examination of the relationship between spectator and spectacle. Smith engages the question of how this relationship might shape the reader’s identity. Does the mere act of observing become a part of our experience? Can a narrative strategy effectively mimic such an experience?In posing these questions, Smith weaves together her collection of stories with an appeal to her readers’ common experiences. Exploring a compilation of everyday occurrences—from small conversations with someone sitting next to us to a misdelivered package on our doorstep—Smith’s candid style leads us to the intersection of our past and our present, forcing examination of how our experiences, real or imagined, shape both.—Staff writer April M.

Circa 2005 the Canadian music scene began to be stirred up and investigated by American indie lovers intrigued by discoveries of The Arcade Fire, The Dears, or Broken Social Scene, among others. Malajube has certainly benefited from the heightened interest, but unusually so, acquiring an international fan-base without catering to an English-speaking audience.Characterized by epic orchestration and multilayered instrumentation, Canadian indie rock bands have developed a cohesive sound that Malajube employs, but to an much brighter end overall. The band’s third release, “Labyrinthes,” is driven by poppy, upbeat, playful tunes without sacrificing this intricate quality.Opening with the grandiose, seven-minute “Ursuline,” which begins with a serene piano melody that descends into choppier guitar riffs, the album begins with an air of caution. This sentiment deteriorates as the album continues, making “Labyrinthes” a sonic journey marked by tranquil lows and exhilarating highs.Though the album is driven primarily by the classic rock band set-up of drums, guitar, and bass, “Labyrinthes” is also filled with interesting quirks that make it clear that the band has no problem with playful production and instrumental experimentation. Among the bells and whistles, tambourines add a cheerful feel to ”Le Tout-puissant,” and the echo effects on the vocals in “333” provide a mystifying sense of intrigue.Indie lovers have shown affinity for foreign acts in the past, but relatively few bands gain fame without singing at least partially in English. This is not entirely unexpected, as lyrical sophistication often functions as a draw to lesser-known music, giving listeners more than the mindless, bubblegum pop dribble heard on the radio. Malajube, however, have achieved surprising success all while being incomprehensible to a majority of American listeners. For those who don’t speak French, Malajube’s disinterest with singing in English may have removed one of the oft analyzed and praised portions of rock, but it has done so without diminishing their musical appeal.While an understanding of the lyrics might allow listeners to further appreciate Malajube’s talent, this is certainly not necessary to enjoy the music that the band has crafted. In fact, to non-francophone ears, the French lyrics add a heightened sense of mystery and intrigue to the album. To the common American listener, the focus on the vocals is no longer their meaning, but rather the manner in which they are expressed.Singer Julien Mineau’s vocals range from the drawn out and mysterious chants of “Christobald,” creating a contrast with the up-tempo rhythms that bracket the song, to the wistful and smooth vocals of “Casablanca.” It is with this variation that Malajube adds the complexity that their album title, “Labyrinthes,” implies. Malajube’s comspositions also rely heavily on keyboard. This prominent usage allows Malajube to highlight the intricacy of their songs and the range of their vocal expression, regardless of the subject matter of their lyrics, better than their guitar bass and drums alone could do. Simple keyboard lines mirror the vocals, swiftly changing from more fluid melodies during the soothing croons of “Dragon de Glace” to the blaring staccato and  raspy French interspersed throughout “Porte Disparu.”Many praises aside, “Labyrinthes” may not always be the most engaging album. However this does not diminish the band’s accomplishment. By focusing on upbeat and lighthearted melodies, Malajube has succeeded in crafting an album that will capture a broad audience appreciative of the spirited songs despite the potential language barrier.—Staff writer Erika P.

British singer-songwriter Lily Allen has a rather mellifluous name. She dresses in full skirts and dons a lot of bows. She wears her chocolate-brown hair in side bangs to accentuate her round face. Her melodies are simple and sweet. In short, she plays the part of a naïve little girl particularly well. It’s an impressive façade, and in her new album “It’s Not Me, It’s You,” she uses it to her great advantage.A boldly irreverent lyricist, Allen seems to have taken Mary Poppins’ advice about “a spoonful of sugar” to heart. While she delivers messages that are brash, defiant and sometimes painfully candid, she delivers them in poppy tunes, soft beats and simple harmonies. Her voice, too, is gentle and—at least to the American ear—charmingly accented. But the main appeal of her music lies in what she has to say, and she knows it functions as both the primary melodic element and rhythmic focus of her songs, drawing attention to her messages more than anything else. Her idiosyncratic combination of indulgently catchy tunes and witty, strong-willed lyrics—best exemplified in the 2006 hit single “Smile,” a song about cynicism and emotional independence in response to a whiny ex—define her unique persona.Allen has been on the scene for a few years (her first album “Alright, Still,” was released in 2006), developing her style while staying true to her original devil-in-disguise tactics. Although “It’s Not Me, It’s You” is only her second full album, the encouraging success of her earlier work—earning her a BMI songwriting award and a double-platinum record—has given Allen enough confidence to explore and experiment here. It’s refreshing to hear ska, jazz, and techno influences slipping into her pop beats. In one track on the new album, “Never Gonna Happen,” Allen uses folksy strings and an accordion, along with a handclap slowly building in tempo, to drill her message of rejection into the clueless head of an unwanted suitor. At the same time, though, she cleverly unravels admissions of ways in which she’s led the poor guy on, making her repeated question “How on earth could I be any more obvious?” an ironic one. The song mocks immaturity on several levels and comes off as one of the strongest on the album.Allen’s confrontational candor makes several appearances on “It’s Not Me, It’s You;” it is manifest even in the title of the album itself. In “Not Fair,” Allen sings frankly about how her boyfriend’s sexual shortcomings eclipse all his other virtues, and in “Fuck You” she bravely denounces some acquaintances for being “small-minded” and “racist,” claiming their “point of view is medieval.” In each, though, Allen again delivers some comic relief—the title of the latter, for instance, is repeated over and over in the manner of Alvin and the Chipmunks.While it’s easy to enjoy the seemingly innocuous Allen deliver poetic justice, she also demonstrates that she, too, can admit weaknesses and regrets. She includes an endearing number called “Who’d Have Known,” a cautious confession of the awkward anxieties of a nascent attraction, and a long apology called “Back to the Start” in which she repents the past pettiness she displayed towards a sibling. “Back to the Start” is oddly set to a techno beat, when it could have benefited from a slower, soulful pace, but this compositional decision does lend the piece a gushing, earnest and embarrassed tone below the overpowering background noise. The song does, however, boast a sincere moment of respite from the buzz in which Allen promises, “this is not just a song / I intend to put these words into action.” The singer displays more skill with techno influences in her criticism of drug culture, “Everyone’s At It.”While Allen’s new album could fairly be characterized by confrontation, she is not just contrary for the sake of contrariness. Not allowing herself to escape her own far-reaching criticisms, “The Fear” is a previously-released track about the seduction of show business and the ways Allen has compromised herself for it. She quips, nodding to the obsessions of contemporary politics, “I am a weapon of massive consumption; / It’s not my fault, it’s how I’m programmed to function.”There are, of course, songs less successful than others—for instance, “Chinese” tries to celebrate the comfortable and mundane in a relationship but comes off as a little monotonous, and the self-congratulation of “He Wasn’t There,” despite the song’s inspired beginning reminiscent of an old Billie Holiday record, feels a little flat. Still, Allen’s bittersweet lyrics echo long after the record has finished playing, and it’s a challenge to forget her infectious melodies. Don’t be fooled by her darling demeanor; in “It’s Not Me, It’s You,” she proves her mettle as both a musician and satirist.

The Pains of Being Pure At Heart: it demands ellipses, or at the very least, abbreviation. The Pains, TPOBPAH, perhaps PBPH, or, as their label Slumberland Records prefers, POBPAH. One verb short of a clause, it is arguably the most misguided decision in band-naming since the exclamation point in Panic! At the Disco. Thankfully, Kip, Kurt, Alex, and Peggy—who, in a seeming reversal on their word count policy, prefer to forego their surnames—are much better at making music than they were at christening themselves.On their self-titled debut album, they prove themselves to be unapologetically dedicated to crafting tight and wistful three-minute pop songs. Boy-girl, matchy-matchy harmonies are blissfully paired with jangling rhythms and mumbled chords.To say that POBPAH’s music is derived from Twee—that dainty, sweet style that emerged from mid-80s England, then-described by music critic Simon Reynolds as “a revolt into childhood”—would be an understatement. While the Twee sound longs for a greater, happier future, it is ever-wistful for lazy summers and bubblegum popsicles. POBPAH similarly builds upon the output of Shoegaze bands of the same period, marked by a distorted, almost atmospheric guitar sound.Pegging the album as a simple distillation of its influences would be reductive, and it would likewise be inaccurate to say that what they’ve made is wholly original. The quartet wear their influences proudly, at times almost offensively so. The album’s closer “Gentle Sons” has more than a passing resemblance to The Jesus & Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey.” One could continue the guessing game of which parts of which tracks were influenced by which bands. However such a deconstruction would not only be an exhibition of the worst kind of musical machismo; it would suggest that the band’s songs are more pastiche than product.They are not. Inspirations aside, theirs is a group of fully formed, self-sustaining songs that ultimately do not depend on the work of their forefathers to be realized. While its clear that they are devoted fans of pop music, they have more intensely studied the history of “The Perfect Three-Minute Pop Song.” They are proud scholars of this history but are determined to make their own.Given this devotion, it might be easy to dismiss the album as a series of stand-alone, mixtape-bound singles. But POBPAH shows signs of craftsmanship that, while not wholly successful this time around, are evocative of a strong sense of self and suggest future promise.The album could have opened with the driving guitars and “woo woo” vocals of “Come Saturday,” the record’s second track, starting the record off with the explosive energy for which many of POBAH’s influences are known. However, the band seems to be cognizant of two things: being professionally jubilant is tiring work, as is bopping your head along to 10 songs in a row. They wisely attempt to forestall this inevitable exhaustion, though not quite successfully, by opening with “Contender,” an airy, gorgeous tale of a hapless admirer of music and art, destined never to create, only to consume. It is, in a sense, the picture the band’s detractors might paint of them. They acknowledge the issue, and in doing so, seek to move above it, displaying a level of forethought that suggests they are more than a glorified cover band.On the whole, they manage to compensate for the exhaustion that can come from such a poppy record, and generally, they demonstrate the intentionality they strived for. The songs’ twee inclinations contrast with the distortion of guitars and vocals. The sweetness of the melodies contrast, at times, with the subtle and the plaintively morose lyrics. “A Teenager in Love” would be at home in any John Hughes movie, a fitting soundtrack to Molly Ringwald eyeing a love interest across the gymnasium at a crowded school dance. It comes as a surprise, to say the least, when the affected, muttered lyrics become clear: “And if you made a stand / I’d stand with you ’til the end / But you don’t need a friend when you’re a teenager in love with Christ and heroin.” And like that, Molly Ringwald is cast to the background in the mental picture, lingering to strike an evocative contrast to the song’s underpinnings. This is The Pains of Being Pure At Heart at their best, when they avoid the “aw shucks” puns that they can otherwise be drawn to, crafting excited, conflicted hymn-ditties for the “Pete and Pete” set.At times, they miss their mark, as not all listeners can share their tolerance for sticky-sweet synthesizer, ironic xylophone, and the aforementioned puns and clichés. The song “Young Adult Friction,” notably and unfortunately, is marred by the phrase “Don’t check me out!”In the battle between nostalgia and relevance, the latter ultimately wins out, due to little more than cunning, guile and a true gift for songwriting. The Pains’ debut album is wrought in broad, confident brushstrokes of song, making evocative, yet playful gestures toward tearing down the temple they so firmly occupy. Gamboling through these most wintry of times with summer glee, The Pains of Being Pure At Heart gives us a welcome first album—terrible puns, names, clichés, and all.—Staff writer Ruben L. Davis can be reached at rldavis@fas.harvard.edu.

The Black Keys, Dan Auerbach’s blues-rock duo, have always seemed to hold to their well-established sound. The two-man band has made four full-length albums since their debut, “The Big Come Up,” in 2002, hardly altering their spare, heavy blues between their first album and their latest, “Attack & Release.” Too unprocessed and deferential to have any place in the pop world; too no-nonsense and slow to really belong in the world of indie rock; and lacking a “Seven Nation Army”-style breakthrough hit, the Keys have been making their music for a scattered and diverse audience devoted to their remarkably consistent output. So it might come as something of a shock to hear Dan Auerbach altering his sound a bit on his new solo album “Keep It Hid.” One of that new brand of solo album that includes more instrumentation than on the band’s regular output, “Keep it Hid” finds guitarist Dan Auerbach attempting to push his sound outside of the usual boundaries of a Black Keys album. Part of this expansion involves experimenting with levels of diminished intensity outside of the Keys’ consistently heavy-handed work. The album crafts a clearer arc than anything previously released by the Keys, starting slowly and lifting up to a peak before settling down gently on the delicate Taj Mahal-like final track “Goin’ Home.” The album’s opener, “Trouble Weighs a Ton,” makes clear the new direction Auerbach is taking. He seems to be doing homage to an older, gentler side of the blues genre, keeping the volume low as he crows moodily over his minimal strumming. Auerbach is a skilled guitar player with a wistful voice, and “Trouble Weighs a Ton” is certainly an unobjectionable song, but as an album starter, it falls a bit short. Rather than moving in its gentle simplicity, the song feels generic and a bit boring, crawling rather than coasting slowly along. Perhaps more than anything, it feels like Auerbach, whose love of blues rock almost burst from his past albums, simply isn’t excited by the slower paced song.The album soon picks up with “I Want You More,” as Auerbach both moves into more familiar territory and expands his sound in interesting ways. With his guitar growling like a bass and his intense voice snarling coarsely on top of it, Auerbach creates a smoky, back-alley vibe very much like that of a Tom Waits song.The album continues its slow crescendo, building up the intensity through the driving rhythm of “Heartbroken, In Disrepair,” the moodier, organ-driven “Real Desire,” and the raspy, Creedence Clearwater Revival-sounding “Mean Monsoon,” before hitting the album’s drum-dominated peak, “The Prowl.” “The Prowl” is at once extremely similar to and strikingly different from the typical Black Keys song. While much of “Keep It Hid” seems to be aiming for a more organic, varied sound, “The Prowl,” the hardest-hitting song on the album, feels neater and more contained than any similarly heavy Keys track. Auerbach mans the drums on this song—as on the rest of the album—and here especially one can feel the difference between his drumming and Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney’s. Where Carney’s messy pounding would propel the songs forward, Auerbach’s careful, more articulated syncopation gives them a more polished feel. This distinction, not necessarily a positive or negative one, is one that applies to the album as a whole. “The Prowl,” and the album in which it is situated, is more measured and quiet than Black Keys works. “Keep It Hid” isn’t a flawless album, it doesn’t conform in every way to what we’ve come to expect from the artist who produced it, and it may disappoint hardcore fans. But listening to Auerbach tracing out new territory is certainly an engaging experience.

It’s hard to make fun of people who display immense earnestness. Hurling well-aimed boomerangs at themselves in an attempt to make others laugh with them rather than at them, Chester French pulls no punches in their premiere music video. Unfortunately, it seems like people will be laughing, heartily, at Chester French while watching their video.In “She Loves Everybody,” D.A. Wallach ’07 couldn’t possibly have looked nerdier—he sports a curly Jew-fro and bowtie—while singing about having safe sex with a cheating girl. Bandmate Maxwell C. Drummey ’07 seems to embody the rocker spirit with shoulder length hair and the stony, “I don’t give a damn” look. However, his style must have been too hip a statement as both Drummey and Wallach get brutally beaten in the music video by a girl half their size.As the song kicks into higher gear, the blows on the duo continue and Wallach, in particular, can’t seem to get enough. Looking hopelessly pathetic, Wallach smiles through the punches, helplessly devoted to his vicious attacker.The viewer can’t help but be reminded throughout the video of the turbulent and short-lived romance between the long-haired Drummey and his boo, Peaches Geldof. While the song was written before the rise and fall of their relationship, which was all of about half a year, the video vixen and her actions seem symbolic of how the 19-year-old Geldof walked all over Drummey’s heart. The song feels a bit too autobiographical, as even the protection bit seems plausible—honestly, would you have unprotected sex with a girl named Peaches?With their star on the rise, these guys should not feel the need to beat themselves up or brood over past losses. In the end, they’re too hip for their own good and their sound is much sleeker and smoother than their image intimates. So hopefully next time they’ll be able to think of something fresher than just getting walloped for four minutes.—Edward F. Coleman

In the world of hip-hop, where big egos are as common as sampled beats, Cameron “Cam’ron” Giles remains a shining beacon of arrogance in pastel paisley and a candy-colored Escalade. Still, it’s been over three years since the swaggering MC scored a mainstream hit, and a newfound modesty is on display in the video for his latest single, “I Hate My Job.” “Ain’t no money for no shoes or purses here,” Cam’ron raps about his meager paycheck. This presumably leaves little to no money for video production—it’s possible that the entire thing was recorded on a Handycam.A raucous piano riff kicks off a dull workday, narrated through the eyes of Cam’ron’s girlfriend with an almost Biz Markie-esque realism. The flashy whips and mansions have been traded for a mid-size sedan and cubicle, and with mounting bills to pay, “things are getting hectic.” Reclining in a canvas butterfly chair on a weedy hillside, Cam’ron knowingly details the trials and tribulations of “everyday working women”: early morning traffic jams, short lunch breaks, and lighting up in the parking lot.By the second verse, it seems the cocky kid who once called Jay-Z a “camel face” has had his share of humble pie. “I put on my pants, put on my shoes,” continues our detail-oriented narrator as he sets out on a job hunt, dressed for success in a black skull cap and puffer vest. For a man accustomed to rocking pink and purple furs, this ensemble is downright conservative, but his interviewers disagree. “You know we’re not hiring murderers, right?” one of them asks, following up with questions about his criminal record. “I’m working on my future, why you need to know my history?” Cam retorts, but to no avail. Heading home empty-handed, the day only gets worse when he finds out his “baby mom’s done changed locks.” Jobless, broke, and unlucky in love, our defeated hero sadly concludes, “Seems like I was born to lose,” leaving us to wonder how he’ll manage to keep his profession as a rapper, let alone an office job.—Roxanne J.

Abdel Kechiche’s “The Secret of the Grain” is a raw and unexaggerated snapshot of the tensions and experiences of a North African immigrant family living in the south of France. Writer-director Kechiche (“It’s Voltaire’s Fault,” “Games of Love and Chance”) employs his familiar documentary-style filmmaking to realistically expose the conflicts and betrayals, emotions and loyalties of this family, making no attempt to moralize or embellish. “The Secret of the Grain” exudes a rare genuineness that allows it to offer a fresh take on perhaps the most depicted subject in the arts: love.The tale lacks sensational dialogue, a rapidly moving plot, and easily recognizable actors. There is also a noticeable lack of interference on the part of Kechiche; the movie does not have a dramatic soundtrack, for instance, that would attempt to evoke specific reactions and emotions in the audience. These subtle directorial choices might fail to lure the average viewer, but those who open their hearts to the life of a man working at a fishing boat dock will likely find themselves steadily absorbed in his relationships and all their complications.The story revolves around Slimane (Habib Boufares), a tired 61-year-old shipyard worker who is laid off from his job after decades of faithful labor. His ensuing unemployment is marked by an absence of direction and purpose, and a hint of despair. “I’ve done nothing, left nothing to you,” he says, disillusioned, to his lover. Yet Slimane’s pride compels him to pull himself out of this dejection, and he decides to pursue an unexpected line of business, opening a family-run restaurant that specializes in serving couscous (a traditional North African dish of steamed semolina served with vegetables and meat). But drawing upon the resources of his family proves complicated, due to the strained relations between his ex-wife, his children, their spouses, and the two women he has come to love. In this way, what begins as a story of Slimane’s hardship grows into a narrative of the struggles of his entire family, even those on its very fringes.The strength of Kechiche’s film lies in his characters, and he literally focuses on them, using long close-up shots that emphasize both their nobler sentiments and their faults—the most visible of which are ingratitude, infidelity, and pride. The absence of overdramatized performances also helps in this regard, drawing attention to the characters’ pains and passions without amplifying them, and refusing to shy away from the harshness of reality sometimes revealed in their experiences. Kechiche’s film revolves around the subject of love but does not romanticize; rather, it reminds viewers of the extent to which love hurts as well as comforts.Kechiche’s skillful reeling in of his viewers is complemented by his abrupt release of them into the sea; the ending of “The Secret of the Grain” is vague and leaves the viewer wondering what became of those he felt he came to know so well. Though frustrating, this is emblematic of Kechiche’s storytelling power; the characters resonate with the viewer long after he has swum away. The short glimpse that is caught of these characters’ lives is retained, like the gash of a hook that leaves questions still burning.—Staff writer Anita B.

“There is no better time to be a film critic than now, because films have never been better,” joked Boston Phoenix writer Brett Michel at Sunday night’s Boston Society of Film Critics (BSFC) Awards Ceremony. “Tomorrow night I am reviewing the remake of ‘Friday the 13th,’ and it promises to be a real masterpiece.”But despite the presence of subpar horror film remakes, Boston’s critics, writers, and film theorists still found something to celebrate at their second annual awards ceremony. The event, held at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, honored the year’s cinematic offerings as well as several local film-related individuals. It was followed by a screening of James Marsh’s documentary “Man on Wire” and a question and answer session with its producer Maureen Ryan. The awards ceremony celebrated local film managers and coordinators, like Kelly Teer and Stefanie Lubkowski—who both recently left their positions at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts—as well as other unsung heroes of the film preservation community, like Steve Livernash of the Harvard Film Archive. Boston Phoenix columnist Gerald Peary described Livernash as “the Dean of Film Projectionists,” praising not only his knowledge of cinematic aesthetics but also his ethical drive to preserve the prints he screens. He credited Livernash for being one of the few projectionists who returns his prints in better condition after screening them.The evening’s final special commendation was awarded to Paul Sherman, who researched, authored, and distributed a book entitled “Big Screen Boston: From ‘Mystery Street’ to ‘The Departed’ and Beyond.” In his introduction, Boston Herald film critic James Verniere described the work as “a book that needed to be written...[it is] smart, funny, intensely detailed, and will never go out of style.”Directly following special commendations, Boston Phoenix contributor Tom Meek announced the fourteen film awards that were decided by the BSFC in December. These included a tie between “Wall-E” and “Slumdog Millionaire” for Best Picture.Another tie resulted in the ceremony’s sole video message, a joint acceptance speech by Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke, who were both chosen for best actor by the BSFC.Mickey Rourke clutched his small, sweater-clad dog to his chest as Penn expressed his gratitude for the award. “We want to thank you for being indecisive Irish men and women,” Penn said. “Discerning indecisiveness.” Following that surprise celebrity appearance was a screening of the BSFC’s Best Documentary of 2008, “Man on Wire.” Structured as a heist film of sorts, the movie follows Philippe Petit’s 1974 quest to cross the World Trade Center towers on a tightrope. In his introduction of the documentary, Boston Phoenix film editor Peter Keough praised the movie’s subtle restraint. “Some movies accomplish more by leaving things out than by putting them in,” he said.Anyone who has seen the film will know immediately what Keough refers to, for while there is plenty of footage concerning the building of the Twin Towers, there is nary a mention of their destruction on September 11th. As such, this absence was one of the first topics addressed by Ryan in the Q&A.“[Marsh] really felt strongly that we would never speak about it,” Ryan said, “because it was about reclaiming the towers for us, focusing on how the story began rather than how it ended.” Ryan also revealed how the star of the movie himself felt about watching his experiences play out on-screen. She recalled that Petit confessed his own nervousness to her: “I was on the edge of my seat thinking, ‘Is he going to make it?’” Ryan, formerly an undergraduate student at Boston College, expressed her joy at being back in Beantown, particularly at the Brattle, a former and frequent haunt of hers. “Second row, balcony center: I saw so many films from that vantage point.”—Staff writer Bram A.

In the late 1980s, an actor’s paycheck was directly proportionate to the height of his roundhouse kick, and Jean-Claude Van Damme stomped skull like he was trying to break the bank. But the era of the action star is long gone, and despite Van Damme’s prolific career over the last two decades, the Muscles from Brussels hasn’t made a memorable flick since his too-cool-to-be-cool turn as Guile in the movie version of popular 90s video game “Street Fighter.” “JCVD” is like nothing anyone could have expected from Van Damme. A brilliantly entertaining confessional, the movie is the self-deprecating, self-referential drama-comedy that Van Damme now seems to have been destined for. Filmmaker Mabrouk el Mechri writes and directs a sad, funny, perfect glimpse at the life of an aging action hero while still maintaining focus on the events of an engaging action film. “JCVD” is a pleasant surprise, honest and endearing without glossing over grittiness. Van Damme is known for being far from an impressive actor, but the opportunity to present a sincere portrayal of himself—rather than a convincing portrayal of an English-speaking caricature—has allowed him to finally flourish on-screen. Critics might argue that it is not difficult to play oneself, but in a movie that essentially lays his career before him, Van Damme lets his character emerge gradually, evolving continually until the final, defining monologue. Mechanically lifted above the set, he turns to face the camera and deliver the speech that has been slowly brewing throughout the movie. Van Damme leaves beneath him the heist situation in which he has become embroiled, reflecting on his troubled life up to that point: the custody battle for his daughter (in real life, his son), his long history of drug use and money troubles, the pains of getting old. Weathered and physically beaten, shot in the eye by one of the robbers, he gives his history; in doing so, he claims his identity, never asking the audience for their sympathy, only for their understanding.Naturally, Van Damme also does what he does best: kicks some ass. The plot of the movie takes a backseat to its biographical exploration, but it still helps to advance Van Damme’s character and dissect the fame that is slowly slipping away from him.  The film opens with Van Damme in mid-scene on the set of a low budget action film. He gets into it with the foreign director over an issue with the poor quality of the set, to which the director replies, “He still thinks we’re making Citizen Kane.”  As the movie unfolds we begin to see Van Damme’s difficulty getting roles (“They gave it to Steven Seagal....He promised to cut off his ponytail.”) and the repercussions for his personal life, where legal fees from his custody case are piling up.  All of this leads him to a post office in his native Belgium which gets held up while he’s inside. Van Damme manages to convince police, the media, and thousands of fans that he is the one burglarizing the post office.  As the heist goes on, two of the robbers argue over their situation, using Van Damme primarily as a bargaining chip, while a third makes more immediate use of the aging acting hero: having Van Damme kick cigarettes out of his fellow hostages’ mouths for his own enjoyment.Taking place for a short time in the United States, and then moving to Belgium for the remainder, the entire movie is shot in a striking amber tone. Aside from more clearly revealing the lines on Van Damme’s face, the hue also serves to make indoor scenes—like those filmed inside the post office—much darker, while adding color and brightness to the world outside. Complemented by a great soundtrack—especially the Curtis Mayfield-penned Baby Huey track “Hard Times”—the film has a good deal of quality aside from its sustained biographical portraiture.“JCVD” is about as far from “Bloodsport” as a film can get, but in the best way possible. If this doesn’t revitalize Van Damme’s career completely, it will have punctuated his career with an exclamation point more triumphant than the sum of everything else he has done.

In one particularly awkward scene of the Valentine’s Day chick flick, “He’s Just Not That Into You,” Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) sits on a sofa with her friend, Alex (Justin Long). Alex, yawning, announces that he is going to retire to bed, and Gigi immediately follows up with, “Is that an invitation?” Such cringe-inducing moments are not rare in the movie; however, unlike the typical chick flick, the film uses these episodes to translate genuine sentiment. Despite the ever-present threat of takeover by cliché, the film goes beyond one-dimensional characters and scenarios and into surprisingly complex psychological territory. Based on the book of the same name by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, “He’s Just Not That Into You” is both a close adaptation and wide interpretation of its original text. At its start, the film stays faithful to the book in both spirit and form, using endearing but direct humor and exaggerated cases to prove the authors’ points. Gigi is meant to represent the universal female voice—constantly worrying, obsessing, overanalyzing, and most of all, making excuses for men. Alex is the suave manager of a bar, who coolly rejects girls on a regular basis but nevertheless decides to take Gigi under his wing. He becomes the voice of co-author Greg Behrendt, talking women down from their high strung obsessions and telling them the painful, but necessary, truth: “If a guy doesn’t seem like he gives a shit, then he genuinely doesn’t give a shit.”On the other hand, “He’s Just Not That Into You” differs from the book in that it centers on the relationships of nine individuals rather than random cases or scenarios. The all-star cast members take on uncharacteristic roles and do better than expected. The typically nerdy Long is convincing as a wise and charming dating guru; Scarlett Johansson deftly handles her comedic moments just as well as her seductive ones; and the dynamic between Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck—a couple who’ve cohabitated for seven years—is more believable than we see in most comedies. The characters are all loosely connected to each other, and the plots weave in and out rapidly throughout the film. This can be distracting, but it also amplifies the surprise during some of even the most predictable plot points. What “He’s Just Not That Into You” does best is preserve and enrich the various voices from the book. It bares women’s insecurities without sacrificing a sense of empowerment. When Alex tells Gigi to stop seeing men who are clearly not interested in her, she replies in a small voice, “So I’m just supposed to run away from every guy that doesn’t like me?...Then there’ll be nobody left.” But despite her initial helplessness, Gigi avoids degenerating into sheer cynicism, and instead asserts her right to hope for love. Further, the film does not shy away from the more painful and awkward sides of relationships. In fact, watching people play out these relationships on screen, rather than reading about them in a book, makes the tension both more palpable and more relatable.While this may not be the ideal Valentine’s Day film to see with a significant other, “He’s Just Not That Into You” gives the boys a voice too. Not all the film’s men are vindicated or excused, nor are all its women victimized; thus, the film achieves a more balanced view of the sexes than its textual counterpart.  For a film based on such a simple concept—following several relationships with the most clichéd and common problems—“He’s Just Not That Into You” is surprisingly smart, touching, funny, and real. There are moments of genuine laugh-out-loud hilarity, and the film achieves it without resorting to crude jokes about sex or sexism. Even better, it resists the urge to end all of the subplots in happiness. Some of the characters change; some do not. Some relationships end predictably; the others take you so much by surprise that you may find yourself a little teary. Most of all, squeezed in amongst all the exaggerated lines—“Myspace is the new booty call,” says Drew Barrymore’s gay co-worker—there is a daring directness with which this film aims to reflect reality—even if it means putting Jennifer Aniston in a role where she is laughed at for being unmarried. —Staff writer Jenny J.

Like any other patriot, you celebrate Presidents Day each year with the same time-honored traditions: you chop down a cherry tree, hold a Presidents Day coloring contest in your place of business, and read the Gettysburg Address in the quiet of your home. But when you’ve exhausted all the super sales and “Lincoln was gay” jokes, keep the good times rolling by calling your friends over and getting drunk with the most badass president who ever set foot on Air Force One: Harrison Ford, a.k.a President James Marshall.  TAKE A SHOT…1. Every time the President ices a terrorist with gratuitous heroism.2. Every time the President smooches a woman who is not his wife.3. Three shots when you hear the Yale joke (it’s super clever). Optional “heyooo!”4. Every time passionate stares are exchanged between the terrorist captain—played by Gary Oldman—and his right-hand man, Andrei—played by Peter Parker’s grouchy landlord in the “Spider-Man” movies.5. Every time you find yourself thinking, “Barack would never do this.”6. Every time you find yourself thinking, “McCain might have done this in his younger days.” 7. Every time one of the sketchy Soviet terrorists sneaks a peek at a skirted woman climbing a ladder.8. Every time a decision of Vice President Glenn Close is ignored because she’s a woman. We’ve come so far since 1997. 9. Every time we are supposed to understand that the president is cool because he likes sports. These include numerous references to his precious baseball glove.10. Five shots when a mention of the baseball glove coincides with a testicle joke.11.  Mormons and pregnant women: drink every time the President kills a terrorist and feels sorry about it (Hint: this never happens).12. When the President takes a break from kicking ass to see if there are any tasty beverages in Air Force One’s cooler. Use this time to replenish your own drink supply and make sure the UHS emergency number is on your speed dial.					—William P. Hennrikus

“Common Casting can be daunting,” says Lei’La’ R. Bryant ’11, one of the directors of “The Vagina Monologues.” “In the fall of my freshman year, my roommates and I auditioned, and no one got callbacks. It was very stressful.” According to Bryant, “The Vagina Monologues,” which aims to celebrate female sexuality and promote female empowerment, also provides a welcoming atmosphere for women who are new to the theater scene at Harvard. The final showing of the production is at 8 pm tonight in the Agassiz Theater. The show was created by Eve Ensler and grew from an off-Broadway production to international fame. Ensler developed the piece in order to celebrate the vagina and to help stop violence against women. The proceeds from this year’s performance benefit groups dedicated to preventing sexual assault, including the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center and Rosie’s Place, a shelter for homeless women and those fleeing abusive relationships. In addition, Ensler’s V-Day movement, which aims to end violence against women and girls, has chosen the rape and abuse of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo as its 2009 spotlight campaign. During the current conflict the use of rape as a weapon of war has become prevalent and “Vagina Monologue” performances around the country will take part in raising awareness of the issue. The production—co-sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR) and the Harvard College Women’s Center—is showing for the eighth time at Harvard. Since the show operates outside of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) umbrella, it holds its own auditions outside of Common Casting. Everyone who auditioned was cast in the production. Bryant says the auditions do not have strict guidelines so that as many people can be involved as possible. “Because of the content, because of the way we do ‘The Vagina Monologues’ anyone who is passionate about this and wants to be involved can be, which I think is wonderful because you get a lot of the non-actresses, the non-theater people,” OSAPR director Sarah Rankin says. “I think it’s really empowering to get up on stage and perform your piece in front of hundreds of people.”For some, the show has served as a launching pad into theater at Harvard. Shannon E. Cleary ’12 decided to audition for the “The Vagina Monologues” and found it to be a welcoming introduction.“I did theater in high school, but I was kind of intimidated by Harvard,” Cleary says. “There are a lot of people here, and I was a freshman. I didn’t go to Common Casting in the fall. I was much too intimidated.”After directing the show for the first time last year, Bryant became involved in productions such as “The Goat” and “Lysistrata” based on relationships she made through “The Vagina Monologues.” Candice C. Smith ’11 participated in common casting for the first time as a result of the positive experience she had acting in this year’s production.“My experience with ‘The Vagina Monologues’ has really been inspiring and uplifting. So I just thought, ‘You know what? I should try out for Common Casting too,’” Smith says. “It reignited my love for theater. I’ve been working with a great group of people, a great group of girls. And it’s really made me want to do more.” The show provides opportunities for people of all levels of acting experience as it includes parts with fewer lines to memorize in addition to longer monologues. In addition, Cleary feels that the empowering message of the show makes it particularly meaningful. “OSAPR sponsors it every year, because it is a very effective way of raising issues such as sexual assault. It reaches a wide variety of folks,” Rankin says. “They want to be involved in the show, because there are few shows with only women in the cast.”Bryant’s favorite monologue is called “Reclaiming Cunt.” It involves the actress leading the audience in a chant of the word “cunt,” a term that is often used as an obscenity, in order to reclaim the beauty of the word. Some believe the word was derived from the goddess Cunina who guarded infants in their cradles. The new perspective given to the word is indicative of the goal of the play as a whole: to transform the way the female body and female sexuality is viewed.   While preparing for her audition, Smith was struck not only by the opportunity to become involved in theater, but by the significance of the show’s message. “I should be speaking this,” Smith says. “I need to speak this, because I feel so strongly about it. And I really feel that it’s important for women to get in touch with who they are and to be proud of who they are.” —Staff writer Melanie E. Long can be reached at long2@fas.harvard.edu.

“Last week, I felt like the Obama campaign,” fretted a young man in my Chinese 130 section this past Tuesday, bracing himself for the class’s unfathomably early first test. “But today...today just feels like the Obama administration,” he continued, as abounding hope and endless possibilities were subsumed by have-to’s and familiar realities.His is a common sentiment, not only at post-shopping period Harvard, but everywhere in the country.  With the President staging an aggressive, cross-country political capital spending spree to drum up support for his stimulus package (tentatively titled H.R. God, I Hope This Works) the rapture surrounding his anointment as Savior of America has been tempered by the emergence of a far less attractive mantra than Hope: Responsibility.That Pepsi has attempted to tie itself in recent months to the banner ideals of the former-Senator’s campaign, then, is both entirely logical and slightly confusing. While for decades the brand has touted itself as the “alternative” soda, the beverage of choice for whatever letter generation the day’s youth happens to have been prescribed, “responsibility” is not a word that comes to mind when one thinks of Pepsi.In response to a recent two to five percent drop in sales across different PepsiCo. properties, the Pepsi cans, bottles, and advertisements with which we are all familiar have been redesigned. The original white tilde has shifted into a sort of off-kilter, swirling “smile,” the size of which differs between Pepsi products. “A smile will characterize brand Pepsi, while a grin is used for Diet Pepsi and a laugh is used for Pepsi Max,” the trade paper Advertising Age noted late last year. Many industry journalists have noted a striking resemblance to the rising sun over red and white American plains on the formerly-ubiquitous “O” Obama logo. Though PepsiCo. Vice President of Marketing Frank Cooper has rejected such comparisons, his defense was nonetheless peppered with Obama-isms. Pepsi has historically been a “catalyst for change,” he stated, and the company believes that the world has reached a “critical moment again,” in which Pepsi’s “thirst for positive change” will be welcomed. Quite serendipitously, Pepsi has timed the re-redefinition of their classic brand with a political phenomenon, firmly clamping itself to the new president’s coattails in an effort to reinvigorate its image as “the forward thinker’s choice.”Historically, Pepsi has navigated the management of its image deftly. While the red, white, and blue graphic in question is now as recognizable as the name Pepsi itself, it was a relative late-comer to the brand’s image. Originally wrought in the 1940s as a show of patriotism and support for a nation at war, the Pepsi Globe stuck, though its message soon evolved from one of simple national encouragement to one that aimed to relate the brand to the hipper American ideals of ingenuity, newness and—yes—hope that characterized the American century. A commercial spot from the 1970s, with the motto “You’ve Got a Lot to Live, and Pepsi’s Got a Lot to Give,” for instance, showed clips of a young man pole-vaulting over a high bar, between rapid-fire shots of marquee lights, cabaret scenes and PYT’s playing the electric guitar. America will continue to reach new heights, said Pepsi, and you kids can have a rollicking time along the way.The climate into which the retooled brand has now entered, however, is markedly different from where it has been before. The concept of the American Dream is not only in the midst of a reevaluation, the morality of aspects of that Dream is in question. If, in coming years, the old unbridled pursuit of happiness (corporate greed, sub-prime mortgages) comes to be synonymous with a decaying economy and an injured American spirit, might this threaten the boundless optimism to which Pepsi has tied itself? Will the benefits of identifying the Pepsi brand so closely with Obama’s clarion call for a new era of hope carry over during a more tempered, less oratorical Obama administration?They seem to be confident that it will. The Super Bowl “MacGruber” ads, staring Kristen Wiig and Will Forte, were a clear effort to associate the beverage with Saturday Night Live, a show now enjoying a post-election bout of cultural relevance. Likewise, Will.i.am’s recent Grammy night performance was directly followed by a highly coordinated Pepsi advertising tie-in, in which the new slogan “Every generation refreshes the world. Now its your turn.” bookended a short video that both analogized our time to the 1960s and unashamedly compared Bob Dylan to Will.i.am, the YouTube star who occasionally raps.So today, as Pepsi gives us a new image and a new declaration, I’m moved to ask: our turn to what? Labor Department projections are simply not as attractive as efforts to build up a newly prosperous, post-Nazi-beating America. Nor will accounting for multiple misguided wars be as sexy as the race to send a man to the Moon. Previous generations were certainly faced with their own adversities, but historically, the youth consensus has been that the troubles were the result of poor leadership or malicious enemies abroad. President Obama has declared that the wars and troubles we face are in fact all of our wars and troubles, marking a new era in which Americans may not feel as free from the burden of responsibility for the state of the nation as they once were. The question then becomes, as more and more people find themselves without homes and jobs, will consumers come to hold Pepsi’s recent rebranding as a symbol of a promised hope that resulted in an all too real reality check?Probably not, if only for the reason that consumers will simply get used to the new can’s revamped globe and lower-case lettering; Pepsi has, miraculously, become pepsi. Soon the innumerable Photoshopped “O”bama logos that now grace a legion of Facebook profiles will be replaced. “O”bama lawn signs will be plucked, stickers will peel, and all the while pepsi will remain its newly diminutive self. But as a recently revealed internal branding document entitled “Breathtaking Design Strategy” claims, the new Pepsi logo is in fact based on the tried-and-true, God-given Golden Ratio; they call it “aesthetic geometry.” Or in AdSpeak, “We can’t believe you paid us that much money to move some lines around.”The biggest problem PepsiCo. faces, it seems, will be curbing vandalism–one can imagine how the new logos could easily be transformed into Pacmen, Pokèballs, or any number of other, more vulgar things. If you’ve seen the new look of pepsi, I think you’ll agree with me in wishing them good luck and Hoping for the best.—Columnist Ruben L. Davis can be reached at rldavis@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Within the narrow confines of the Neil L. and Angelica Zander Rudenstine Gallery, the scenes of rage, shame, and transcendence captured by late photographer Rotimi Fani-Kayode seek to overcome conventions. The provocative images of “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989)”, an exhibit hosted by the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, engulf and overwhelm with the impact of shamanic vision.Rotimi Fani-Kayode was a conflicted man. He describes himself as an “outsider on three counts: in matters of sexuality; in terms of geographical and cultural dislocation; and in the sense of not having become the sort of respectably married professional [his] parents might have hoped for.” Confronted by the conflict between his attempt to assert himself and the attempts of others who wanted to shape him into something else, Fani-Kayode used photography to defend his individuality. “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989)”, which catalogues Fani-Kayode’s photography from 1983 until his AIDS-related death in 1989, serves as a testament to that struggle. In embracing himself through photographic self-portraits, Fani-Kayode bares himself—everything from his homosexuality to his Yoruba tribal heritage to his life in the West.Fani-Kayode’s artwork was inspired by “techniques of ecstasy,” a material and ceremonial form of inspiration used by Yoruba tribesmen to escape the bounds of the physical world and break through to the spiritual world. Through his photography, Fani-Kayode hoped to find his true spirit by transcending the conventions of his environment—from the conservative social mores of Yoruba culture to the prejudices of Western society. The intent behind the photography of “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989)” is clearly honest, open, and noble. However, whether Fani-Kayode’s search for his identity is actually accessible to the viewer is more ambiguous.In fact, the uncompromising honesty of this collection of photographs and its brazen contempt for conventions is precisely what makes it a difficult exhibit to relate to. In many of the photographs of the exhibition, there appears one reoccurring form: the exposed male body. To the viewer unaccustomed to publicly-displayed nudity outside of designated beaches and Primal Scream, the mass of unclothed bodies is initially shocking. “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989)” may be galvanizing, but it is not content with merely assaulting the viewer’s expectations; instead, it seeks to form a pact with the viewer. For his part, Fani-Kayode exposes his deepest struggles on celluloid. The viewer must fulfill his end of the bargain by keeping an open mind to the content of the photographs; otherwise, he cannot relate meaningfully to the ideas Fani-Kayode presents.Fani-Kayode understood that his audiences would be unaccustomed to the often spiritually and sexually infused nature of his photographs. And in fact, it is far too easy to retreat to preconceived notions of appropriate cultural behavior. Because the explicit subject matter is distracting, the viewer loses the ability to view the photos holistically. If, however, viewers are able to strip away their prejudices, “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989)” presents perceptive and personal reflections on life that extend beyond the comforts of convention.Using symbolism and techniques of lighting as his instruments, Fani-Kayode carefully sculpts images of inner conflict. In one photograph left untitled, the concept of tribal masculinity is emphasized by the intense light that shines on Fani-Kayode’s chest, which is puffed up like that of a bird trying to impress a potential mate. In his outstretched hands, he carries colorfully painted tribal feathers that he fans towards the camera lens. Here, Fani-Kayode captures an aggressive figure who simultaneously offers the comfort of tradition through a symbolic image of culture. However, the photograph also reveals a cultural prudishness through its aversion to the open expression of sexuality. The region below the waist is darkened, and the only discernible forms are a golden phallus incorporated into a threatening horned visage drawn in tribal paint. In another photograph entitled “Black Friar,” Fani-Kayode is dressed in black religious garb and set against a dimly lit background. His face is lit from below, as if illuminated by ceremonial candlelight. Fani-Kayode looks uncomfortable in his friar’s robes. The lighting is just strong enough to capture his eyes, which avert downwards and away from the penetrating gaze of the camera and the viewer. Fani-Kayode’s attire seems to suggest conventional Western spirituality; the photographer’s apparent awkwardness in such garb intimates the discomfort of his relationship with these religious values, perhaps due to his homosexuality and his African heritage.Throughout “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989),” the audience is struck by similarly evocative and potent images that present an individual crashing against and through boundaries created by his circumstances. Akin to a subject placed under trance by Yoruba shamans, the viewer of “Rotimi Fani-Kayode (1955-1989)” can retain focus or be distracted, drawn astray by the explicit nature of the photographs. Disciplined viewers, however, are rewarded with a moving meditation of one man’s interpretation of what it means to be displaced.

With no titles to label them, the artwork featured in “Seven” serves as an invitation to journey into the lives of the unidentified people within them. The exhibit—presented by Harvard Real Estate Services in Holyoke Center Arcade through March 4—features pieces by Keina Davis Elswick from the past seven years.Elswick uses portraiture to add an element of the poetic to the everyday. The color blue, a color that Elswick likes for its ability to communicate melancholy, is used throughout her work. The emotion conveyed through the artwork transforms her paintings and their subjects—a woman standing on a winding road, a mother and a daughter, a man with his head in his hand—into melancholic songs. The lyricism emanates from the careful attention given to the eyes; the observer can see into the souls of the characters and enter into their journey. Portraiture has been the focus of Elswick’s work throughout her career. “I’ve always loved portraiture,” she says. “I wanted to focus on faces, because I wanted to focus on the eyes and capture a pivotal moment in a person’s journey in life.”Elswick’s attention to eyes serves as one of the strongest elements of the exhibit. Along with the absence of titles, the eyes encourage spectators to bring their own experiences to the painting while trying to discover what the character is experiencing and feeling at that moment. The ability to bring individual experiences to the work and create a unique vision of the piece allows the viewer to take on an authorial role in the construction of the characters represented.“I want people to be able to bring their own experience to a piece without me guiding them,” Elswick says. “I like the initial response from what somebody’s thinking. It can be something completely different from what I was trying to do.”In addition to the portraits, Elswick has included her recent multimedia pieces, which focus on the contemporary ties between African and Irish culture. One piece includes a picture from a newspaper article about the first school comprised of only African immigrants in Ireland cut into the shape of a shamrock and framed by a school shaped house. Another piece uses both fabric and paint to depict an African woman wearing a heart shaped necklace of the Irish flag. These works show how Ireland has become home to many people of African descent in recent years. While the multimedia pieces that include the use of paint, fabric, photography, and wood invite the spectator to share in the story it portrays, the portraits are the strong point of the exhibit. In the acrylic portraits the characters appear alive and present without any separation of distance or time. The placard accompanying the exhibit says that Elswick wants the work to inspire us to make connections between our ancestors and ourselves, between one culture and another, between the community and the individual.” The engaging portraits encourage the spectator to interpret an unknown world while coloring it with individual experience, creating both a private and communal connection to the artwork. —Staff writer Melanie E.

Three decades before attaining a coveted spot in the Obama administration, Christina “Tina” M. Tchen ’78 was at the helm of another political juggernaut: the Dunster House Committee. And though it may seem an unlikely breeding ground for public office, Tchen was not the only one preparing for a place in the limelight—she ran the HoCo with future Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78.In her role as the Director of Public Liaison for Obama, Tchen will oversee the “front door to the White House,” according to the administration’s Web site, something for which her undergraduates provided early preparation.In addition to serving as HoCo chair, Tchen, a sociology concentrator, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and edited the Arts section of The Harvard Independent. She also pursued her passion for politics as a “gopher” at the Institute of Politics.Though Tchen maintained a busy extracurricular schedule, she did not let it interfere with her social life, according to her blockmate Deborah A. Graham ’78. “She definitely knew how to have a good time as well as work hard,” Graham said. Despite her 4 a.m. work nights—which Graham said were “frequently accompanied by a box of doughnuts”—she said Tchen managed to attend her fair share of parties. If a particularly attractive event fell on a demanding work night, Graham said that Tchen managed to complete her studies and then attend the activity later. Tchen said that during her time at Harvard—in “the days when you could still drink at age 18”—she enjoyed attending athletic events and the post-game social opportunities they provided. “I always went to the games; no one ever didn’t go to the games,” she said. In addition to going to basketball and football games, Tchen said she also often supported her friends on the Harvard soccer team.Friends of Tchen say they are not surprised by her recent appointment to the Obama administration. “Tina was unbelievably hard-working in college,” Graham said. “She was an open person who really tried to relate to everyone and did.” Professor of Sociology Theda R. Skocpol advised Tchen on her thesis, “State Structure and Social Movements in the United States.” She referred to Tchen as “someone who lived out her values,” and who was “very engaged with thinking about social issues.”

The time was 5:45 am. Walking past a deserted Kennedy Center, it struck my group that in the past ten minutes we had seen several sets of blue-red police lights but not a single fellow civilian. Deserted shopping complexes and the occasional pack of home-bound partiers constituted the early morning scene at the riverbank. The light of a purring black helicopter scanned the fractured sheets coating the Potomac, while a hovercraft zipped over them, fissuring the fragile ice.  I imagined the FBI sweeping in and rounding us all up for trespassing. That would be a hell of a way to miss an inauguration. It turned out we had not trespassed. We emerged from under the Theodore Roosevelt bridge, tromped across Constitution Gardens, and reached the array of virgin portable toilets and as-yet-unmanned police barricades that marked the beginning of the viewing area behind the Washington monument. We were still over a mile from the Capitol steps on which the president-elect would take his oath. Here I broke off from my unticketed acquaintances. My older brother’s hard work on the New Hampshire senate campaign had left him with a purple standing room ticket, and his post-campaign travels in Cambodia left him unable to claim it. I made my way up parallel to Constitution Avenue, passing streets still populated by more police than civilians and eventually reaching the intersection at 7th Street.  The time was 6:35 am.  The gate for purple ticket-holders was at Constitution Avenue and 1st Street—just six blocks away. But national guard troops blocked the path, and none could suggest any way to bypass the inaugural parade route they guarded and reach the gate.Leaving the gate, I joined forces with Josh and Amy—a staffer for Rep. Robert Wexler (D-FL) and his behavioral science funding lobbyist wife—in search of an alternate route. On our first attempt we overheard a displeased Samuel L. Jackson working his cell phone over his own inability to make it through the barricade. At least we weren’t the only ones. Eventually, after a three-mile detour, around the White House and parade route, we made the six blocks along Constitution Avenue and reached the purple ticket entry gate. The time was 10:00 am, and 1st street was a mob scene.  Thousands of people—white, black, Hispanic; political professionals and church hat-donning locals beside families from Alaska—pressed against each other in the street in a “line” lacking order and forward movement.  Everybody had heard a different rumor: the section was full and even ticket-holders would no longer be admitted; the metal detectors had malfunctioned and each person was being screened by hand; someone had gone into cardiac arrest; all previous entrants had been re-checked once a series of counterfeit tickets were discovered. The only certainty in the throng lay in the fact that the ceremony could not be delayed, postponed, or rerun.  It had to happen exactly at twelve noon.  Always on time.  By the constitution.Josh and Amy abandoned the quest and elected to go watch the ceremony on TV, but I threw my lot in with the crowd. “Let us in,” we chanted as the moment neared.  By 11:30—the original closing time for security screening—I had advanced far enough to observe that slowly but surely ticket-holders were still making their way through the security point.  By 11:45 I had found my way to a region of the mass of people actually moving forward, albeit slowly. By 11:55 I was at the cusp of the row of metal detectors—at the front and center of the crowd—when the policewoman in charge announced “hold the line.”  Five minutes from the moment, and those around me knew we wouldn’t make it.  They really wouldn’t wait for us. I watched those on the other side of the barricade trickle through the metal detectors. I could hear occasional cheers from inside the secured area but had no indication as to exactly how the ceremony was progressing. At noon I heard, “open them up again.” I removed my coat, passed first in line through a metal detector, received a pat down, and sprinted around a corner to encounter a cheering crowd standing along 1st Street, with thousands in front and millions behind.  Finding a spot amongst the craning necks, I could just begin to focus on the dignitaries on the Capitol steps as Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) introduced the Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts, Jr. ’76 to conduct the swearing-in of the president-elect. The time was 12:03.

It was a radical idea. Everyone I knew at Harvard had always dated the same kinds of people: Classics concentrators, Hist & Lit boys, the occasional social theorist. My female friends had converged on an ideal type. Emaciated and elusive: the Humanities Heartbreak. By senior year, everyone was getting tired of this—even our parents. “The next time you see a skinny, neurotic boy,” my friend’s mother advised, “don’t date him.” Could people like us find love outside the humanities? To freshmen, this question may seem ludicrous. But wait until you actually have a concentration. You will be forced to learn the habits of your discipline: the code words, the inside jokes. You’ll still be able to talk to people from different disciplines, but it may be a struggle. Humanities concentrators have it the worst; sometimes it bothers them that they don’t study facts. Being in the humanities myself, I decided to investigate the question, “Should one date outside the humanities?” in the most rigorous possible way. I talked to some people I knew in order to draw broad conclusions about the human condition—or, at least, the human condition at Harvard. “They’re intimidating,” one of my historian friends said, when asked why he had never dated a scientist. There were the logistical issues, of course: their long hours in the lab, their multiple problem sets, all precluded the possibility of his getting to know girls in the sciences. And scientists get so uppity, he said, just because the questions they ask always had answers. “They think you’re full of crap,” he said. The English concentrator sitting with us was dating an engineer. “He doesn’t like books,” she said.It wasn’t that I couldn’t find examples of interdisciplinary dating at Harvard. But it was rare. Okay, the economists got around—but the social sciences were inherently promiscuous. They didn’t count. Love across real disciplinary boundaries, bringing together scientists and humanists: that was hard to find. And the phenomenon, I discovered, wasn’t limited to undergraduates. Harvard’s 12 residential houses are led by 12 academic couples, and there’s little interdisciplinary mixing among them. Kirkland House masters: both Romance Languages and Literatures. Lowell’s house masters: both Religion. Adams House masters Sean and Judith Palfrey: both doctors, both specializing in pediatrics. Sean Palfrey laughed at me when I asked him about love between disciplines, but he said there were definite advantages to a relationship with someone who really understands you. “I think it helped us in medical school,” he told me. “Out of 12 couples going into medical school, we were the only couple to survive.” Interdisciplinary love seemed doomed. What if you’re arguing with your biologist boyfriend, and you tell him, “Wait a minute. I think we’re trapped in an oppressive discourse”—and he has no idea that you’re talking about Foucault? Or what if your mathematician boyfriend slips his arm around your shoulders and says, “Hey, I think we need to reduce your genus by one?” Do you laugh, or do you dump him? Communication: kind of a bid deal. And yet I couldn’t stop thinking about that final leap: leaving the humanities dating pool forever. No more square glasses. No more jokes about Simone de Beauvoir. The  English major who was dating the engineer seemed cheerful. “I think in some ways dating outside the humanities fulfils the purpose of the Core Curriculum,” she told me. I started telling my friends to stop pining for awkward poets and start hanging out in the buildings we usually avoid. Which might or might not explain how I ended up at the Miracle of Science Bar & Grill. I was sitting across from a condensed matter theorist. Instead of gloves, he was wearing socks on his hands. I decided to ignore that. Our conversation was going okay. He didn’t compare me to a infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. It seemed almost normal. Then he grabbed my coffee cup. “It’s a caustic,” he said, peering into it. “A what?” I said. “It kind of looks like a butt,” he told me.He was pointing to a faint pattern on the surface of the coffee—a double curve where light hit the liquid.“Has that always been there?” I said. How had I missed it? I was a writer. I was supposed to notice things. “Yup,” he said. He moved the cup around. “See? It’s still there.” I looked at him, bemused. I looked back down at the coffee. “What’s it called?” I asked. “That shape?” “Nephroid,” he said. I tiled the cup and watched the pattern change. “Huh,” I said. I was thinking, funny, it’s almost Valentine’s Day.

The next time you’re singing along to “Live Your Life” while piling up your plate, know that the cooks love Rihanna just as much as you do. The radio stations are chosen by the dining hall staff, and while you can count on hearing Top 40, classic rock, or oldies in most houses, not all d-hall music is created equal. Afternoons at Quincy are dominated by oldies, the bosses’ favorite, with classic rock coming on after 4:00 p.m. But when Mike L. Charles is working, expect to hear some rap up in Quincy House. “That’s usually played on Saturday nights when you’re getting ready to go to the club,” explained Charles, who likes Jay-Z and Mos Def. Quincy is also known for techno night, complete with flashing lights. It’s dinner time at Currier and a Celine Dion remix is pumping at the grill, courtesy of d-hall manager Amy Lester. “She plays so much garbage,” complained cook Nick F. Heron, who tries to alternate between eighties, rock, and country music to avoid dance mixes. “The constant beat drives me crazy after a while,” he explained.Kirkland varies its styles, with anything from seventies to Rage Against the Machine playing at the grill. But the true music aficionado of K-House is card swiper Tommy Hardy, a club bouncer with a Clash-inspired tommy gun tattoo and his own iPod dock stationed at his desk. Despite his diverse music tastes, he limits what he plays at work. “Obviously I’m not going to listen to Fitty or Slayer,” he said. “I’ll put on someone like Dylan.” If you need a reggae fix, Leverett’s dining hall manager is known to break out his iTunes collection, while Eliot offers live piano music at Sunday brunch. But some staffers still aren’t satisfied. “I want some B-52’s playing…you know, ‘Love Shack,’” said Adams cook William D. Nicolson. “That would be sweet.”

Shields ’09, ‘Petros’—Glitter assistant for all public appearances. Don’t think for a second that body glow occurs naturally.3. Reverend Peter J. Gomes—Personal religious counsel. Things weren’t working out with Jeremiah Wright.4. Marcyliena Morgan—White House D.J.5. Michael Sandel—Mediator in all family disputes/couples counselor.  Because, really, what is fairness anyway?6. Jeremy S. Lin ’10—Obama’s personal basketball trainer.  Dunking on Michelle gets old after a while.7. Steven Pinker—Hairdresser.8. Derek M. Flanzraich ’10 —Court jester. Hosts the official Obama Family YouTube videos.9. N. Gregory Mankiw—Obama’s charisma/public appearances coach.10. Matthew M. Di Pasquale ’09—Photographer.  Hoped to publish a monthly family newsletter, but everyone keeps claiming to be “too busy” or “too creeped out” to actually sit down for an interview.11. Matthew L. Sundquist ’09—Name-remember-er. Whispers them into Obama’s ear at important functions, but resorts to calling everyone “dude” if he forgets.12. Michael C. Koenigs ’09—Manager of the Obama YouTube channel. Trying to find a replacement for Flanzraich.13. Drew Gilpin Faust—Family historian/scrapbook maker.14. College Events Board—Party planning committee.  Malia and Sasha better be fans of Gavin.15.

Thanks to a friend with a clever CS50 project, we now have a computer program that will produce our column for the rest of the year. By allowing readers to choose their own jokes, we hope to finally have at least a few readers who think we’re funny. So grab your highlighter and get ready to choose your own adventure!Everyone knows that section is like (a rainy day/a bridge to Terabithia/a highway to Terabithia/a Nutri-Grain bar)—that is, really (easy/fiscally responsible/jumbo/not enough data to decide).Acing section requires preparing far ahead of time—to begin, show up early posing as your TF by wearing (a cardigan/a beret/a pinwheel hat/hipster glasses/a corduroy jacket/a cloak of invisibility/a cardigan made of berets). Start by asking if anyone has (“engaged with the text”/“at least watched the movie”/“been with an Asian”/”read the latest Marmaduke”/“read the latest Marmaduke as a Marxist critique of suburban angst”).When the real TF does show up, make sure you size him up quickly, and remark, (“Well, well, well…if it isn’t ol’ Hubert Humphrey”/“You can’t spell ‘grad student’ without ‘RAD student’!” [INSERT HIGH FIVE]/“You are surprisingly attractive. I will politely yield”.)If the TF angrily demands you sit down, remark, “TF equals teaching fellow? More like (tip-top friend/total fellator/titanic fellator/toothless fellator/tempestuous frigate/depressed and purposeless man in his early 30s).”Your TF will undoubtedly ask you to write your name on a 3x5 index card, but spice it up by (writing your name backwards and then directing him to a mirror/drawing a treasure map of the campus revealing the location where you hid the REAL 3x5 index card/writing the number of girls you’ve been with [for frequent readers of this column please use scientific notation]/folding the paper into an origami goose and then claiming that it is part of your “culture”).Now, it is time to introduce yourself. Everyone knows that first impressions count—so make a big one. If your TF asks for an interesting fact about you, claim to have (made out with Lady GaGa/been a contestant on Global Guts/gone to second base with Golda Meir/seen Tom Selleck in an airplane museum/lost your virginity to Lil’ Bow Wow…’s cousin).But you can’t rest on your laurels for long. Before you know it, you are going to have to make a cogent argument, like (Jurassic Park I is better than Jurassic Park III/snakes are friends/they’re not upperclass “houses”…they’re upperclass “homes”/being quadded is not punishment for sins in a past life/it’s not gay if you’re drunk).A lot of section is just about killing time. Everyone hates those awkward silences when TFs look for answers and no one wants to raise their hand. After ten seconds of silence, you should (start a slow clap/judge a book by its cover—with special reference to color and texture/live like you were dyin’/pretend the section is a crashing plane; choose whom you would rescue and explain why, without explaining the scenario/give the signal for Mariachi Veritas to take it away!).But not every section is a match made in heaven. Conflicts between students in section are more common than we would like to admit. When you have selected your section arch-nemesis, proceed to (picture them naked and leave illustrated notes criticizing their physique/learn a mellifluous ocarina dirge to play whenever they speak and then when they finish, exclaim, “As if!”/follow up on all their comments by saying, “Building off what this major league code-orange intergalactic dickswamp supreme just said…”).But not all conflicts are between students—sometimes, students and TF just can’t seem to get along. If your TF is a real asshole like (Registrar Barry S. Kane), at least take solace in the fact that he has been on “To Catch a Predator” (once/twice/three times/was caught but not apprehended by yelling “Punk’d!” and looking enough like Ashton Kutcher to pull it off). Most importantly, compared to this column, section could never be as (steamy/creamy/dreamy/dickswamp).

On the shelves of the Cabot Science Library sit a license plate, several action figures, ape skulls, and a television screen looping a cartoon video of Felix the Cat. The objects are part of an exhibition—the culmination of months’ work by the students of Professor Janet Browne’s History of Science 238: “Rethinking the Darwinian Revolution.”To celebrate the year of Charles R. Darwin’s 200th birthday, the course’s eight students conducted research and constructed a display on the English naturalist. Each of them tackled a specific aspect of his life and legacy for the project; among the exhibit’s offerings include a children’s book on the H.M.S. Beagle, a Japanese translation of “On the Origin of Species,” and finch and mockingbird specimens from the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.“The purpose of the class and the exhibit is to see how we take this mountain of scholarship about Darwin—the Darwin industry—and show how he, his life and times, and his contributions of science have been understood over the last 150 years,” said Jenna A. Tonn, a first-year graduate student in the History of Science Department and a member of the course. “It’s probably the only exhibit about Darwin where you see everything on Darwin paraphernalia and bobbleheads to original copies of important texts by Darwin.”Melissa M. Lo, also a first-year graduate student in the course, said that evolution did not achieve its status as universal knowledge until biologists years later expounded the idea. Her role in the exhibition involved showcasing the work and writings of one such chief scientist, Harvard Professor Ernst W. Mayr—otherwise known as the “Darwin of the 20th century.”The exhibit is to not only to “show just that Darwin was this bright guy, but how he has networked into so many cultural aspects and disciplines,” said Lo. “He’s traveled from a tiny little island in the Atlantic to a legacy of global impact.”The class’s display marks the beginning of the University’s commemoration of Darwin’s birthday. Starting at 10 a.m. today, a nine-hour Origin-a-thon will be held in five different locations throughout campus for a full reading of Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species.” Browne and Andrew Berry are teaching an “Understanding Darwinism” class open to the public, and Harvard scholars will discuss the scientist’s impact on their work in a “Darwin and Me” afternoon symposium. The Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub is hosting a birthday party from 8-10 p.m., featuring free drinks, live student music, and a Darwin trivia contest.Lo invites the general public to experience the class’s exhibit in the context of today’s Darwin Day celebration: “It might be interesting to someone coming from the reading of ‘On the Origin of the Species’ to go to the Cabot Library to see what people have done with it and the rest of Darwin’s legacy.”Browne, who is offering a talk at the symposium and a lecture titled “Darwin 200: Re-thinking the Revolution” at 6 p.m., extends a similar welcome. “Do make a detour to Cabot to see their work,” she said. “The exhibition explores why Darwin still packs such a punch today and how he has become a modern icon.”—Staff writer Victor W.

A California-based legal publication revealed Tuesday that Facebook.com paid $65 million to settle accusations that its founder Mark E. Zuckerberg ’07 stole elements from rival social networking site ConnectU to create his multi-billion dollar Web site.The Recorder obtained the information from an inadvertent disclosure in the January newsletter of Quinn, Emanuel, Urquhart, Oliver and Hedges, the law firm that represented ConnectU until it was fired last spring. In 2004, ConnectU founders Cameron S. H. Winklevoss ’04, Tyler O. H. Winklevoss, ’04, and Divya K. Narendra ’04, filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that Zuckerberg used their code to create his now well-recognized social networking Web site. He had worked for them as an undergraduate.The firms settled the case last April, intending to keep the figure confidential. In June, the Winklevoss brothers and Narendra appealed to a San Jose district judge, stating that they were mislead into accepting stocks worth less than Facebook purported. In a move characteristic of the secrecy surrounding the settlement, Judge James S. Ware asked reporters to leave the courtroom during the proceedings. Ultimately, he rejected ConnectU’s appeals.With the figure now out in the open, media sources continue to speculate on the reasons for the settlement, as well as the settlement itself.“Sixty-five million dollars is a significant sum—it’s certainly more than the cost of the defense,” Chris S. Graham, an intellectual property litigator, told The Recorder. “But it’s a very small percentage of [Facebook’s] valuation and therefore could be argued by Facebook to be a payment based on considerations other than the merits of the claims.” According to recent estimates by the Web site Silicon Alley Insider, Facebook, Inc. was valued at $4 billion. Harvard Law School Professor Phillip R. Malone ’81, the director of HLS’s Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Center, said that the settlement was smaller than ConnectU may be entitled to should their claims be true. He said parties often consider more than the just the odds of winning when deciding whether to settle.“[The situation] was becoming a taint on Zuckerberg’s reputation,” he said. “Sometimes businesses decide it’s best to settle this type of thing.”A spokesman from Quinn Emanuel declined to comment, citing the firm’s policy. Representatives from ConnectU and Facebook could not be reached yesterday.—Staff writer Sean R. Ouellette can be reached at soullet@fas.harvard.edu.

Students digging into the shrimp and peanut pad thai served by Harvard University Dining Services on Monday night may have noticed the lack of a central ingredient—diced peanuts. HUDS decided to eliminate peanut-based menu items due to the current peanut-borne salmonella outbreak that may have claimed nine lives and caused over 600 illnesses. In consultation with the University’s Environmental Health and Safety Department (EHS), which monitors food recall information, HUDS elected to remove certain foods in residential and retail operations as a precautionary measure. EHS Public Health Manager Valerie Nelson said that in light of the quickly growing recall list, the elimination of nearly all peanut-containing products is meant to protect students from foods that “may be thought to be safe one day, but which conceivably could be involved in the recall the next.” Although none of the ingredients have been formally implicated, HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin said that HUDS is attempting to “stay ahead of the recalls.” Dishes affected by the policy include peanut butter cookies—which are temporarily suspended—as well as the aforementioned pad thai. But the peanut butter served in dining halls will not be affected by the new policy. According to Nelson, the safety of the various peanut butters HUDS serves—Teddie Peanut Butter, the bulk residential dining peanut butter; Once Again Nut Butter, the organic peanut butter; and Smucker’s Peanut Butter personal packs, offered in retail locations and catering, was confirmed at the onset of the outbreak. The policy will be in place until EHS—which receives information daily from the Massachusetts Health and Homelands Alert Network and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration—advises HUDS that it is safe to return the items to its menu. Nelson said that decisions to reintroduce peanut-containing foods will be made on a case-by-case basis after the magnitude of the salmonella outbreak subsides, and the manufacturers used by HUDS can establish that their products are not linked with the tainted peanut butter produced by the Peanut Corporation of America. Students acknowledged that HUDS’ decision was reasonable from the perspective of safety. “If the threat is great enough, then HUDS should try to protect our health,” said Linda Zhang ’12. Others were more indifferent regarding the removal. “I won’t miss the peanut butter cookies,” said Madelaine D. Boyd ’12. “I’d rather have coconut congo bars.” —Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

Paul Farmer, the famed Harvard Medical School professor, has been named the Lois Pope LIFE International Achievement Award winner for his work in medicine and public service. The official presentation of the award will take place on Feb. 17 in Miami. 
Farmer, the Presley Professor of Medical Anthropology in the Department of Social Medicine at HMS, has devoted his life to the study of infectious diseases from a clinical and social perspective. 
A press release from the LIFE Foundation praised Farmer for his work in pioneering “novel, community-based treatment strategies for AIDS and tuberculosis in Haiti, Peru, Rwanda, Lesotho and Malawi, among other impoverished nations.”
Lois Pope—philanthropist and founder of the Lois Pope LIFE Foundation—said her foundation tries to give $100,000 every year “to a person who has made a tremendous difference in everyone’s life.”
“He is more than a doctor and a medical expert to me,” Pope said. “He is an advocate of the proposition that we can save lives, understand interrelations with politics, wealth, and disease.” 
In 1987, Farmer co-founded Partners in Health, which has since developed into a world-wide health organization that provides free treatment for those in developing countries neglected by their health care systems. 
Arthur Kleinman, Farmer’s former Ph.D. dissertation advisor, said Farmer uses his awards “for publicity for the organization and to increase funding,” as he did when he received the $100,000 Austin College Leadership Award in 2007. “Farmer proves that you can do serious research and advocacy as well as having deep values about social justice that inform your research and that also inform practical programme development and clinical work,” said Kleinman, a fellow faculty member in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine.
Anne E. Becker ’83, another faculty member in the department, said that “the wonderful thing about Paul and the Lois Pope award is that his research and work has been able to shine a light on problems that would have otherwise not have come to the attention of people who want to make a difference.”
The LIFE foundation award is just the most recent accolade for the Harvard Medical School graduate—Farmer received a “genius grant” from the MacArthur Foundation in 1993. 
Farmer could not be reached for comment yesterday.

Two experts on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict laid out contrasting approaches to resolving the situation in a panel discussion at the Institute of Politics yesterday evening.Shai Feldman, professor of politics and director of the Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis University, argued that Israelis need to be convinced that the road to peace and the two-state solution will not jeopardize their security. Rashid Khalidi, professor of Arab studies and director of the Middle East Institute at Columbia University, said that the world powers should focus on building Palestinian political unity rather than delegitimizing Hamas. The panel was moderated by Harvard Kennedy School Professor R. Nicholas Burns.While introducing the speakers, Burns emphasized the effects of the 61-year struggle on the Israeli and Palestinian people.“The Israeli people have not known a single day of peace, and the Palestinian people have not seen a single day of justice,” he said.Khalidi acknowledged the gravity of the situation, especially in light of the recent escalation in violence in Gaza, but said that he remained cautiously optimistic.“I actually think there is a glimmer of a possibility to break this gridlock,” said Khalidi.For Feldman, an important component of achieving peace is convincing Hamas to adopt nonviolent means.“There is no way Hamas can meet the expectations of their constituencies in a state of conflict,” said Feldman. Both panelists applauded President Barack H. Obama’s choice of former Senator George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East, but they also had reservations about Mitchell’s effectiveness.“The Senator has no chance in hell in achieving anything if he doesn’t have the full support of the President and the Secretary of State,” said Khalidi.“I would say that it’s okay to have Senator Mitchell go once or twice more for fact-finding missions,” said Feldman, arguing that excessive visits would decrease his legitimacy.Students in attendance expressed mixed opinions on the content of the panel.“I appreciate that there is a civil discourse taking place on this issue,” said Abdelnasser A. Rashid ’11, a member of the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee. Matt R. Cohen ’11, a co-president of Harvard Students for Israel, generally approved of Feldman’s statements but was skeptical of the effect that the friendship between the two panelists may have had on Feldman’s willingness to defend Israeli policies.“Coming from what appears to be a long-standing relationship with Professor Khalidi, I don’t believe he was the best representative of Israel,” he said.

Junior seminars in economics—the only small undergraduate courses taught by the department’s faculty—may become yet another victim of the University-wide strain borne of the financial crisis. With faculty departing and Harvard’s hiring slowdown hindering their replacement, the already stretched department does not have enough faculty members to teach the seminars, according to some department members. “We have a shrinking pool of faculty to teach the same pool of students,” said Economics Professor Claudia Goldin, who taught a seminar this fall. “How can we teach as effectively when our faculty is down so many people?”The decision to cancel junior seminars for the ’09-’10 academic year—which Goldin said has already been discussed by the department as a very likely option—will not be finalized until at least mid-March, when the first draft of the department’s list of offerings is due for the course catalogue, according to the department’s Academic Coordinator Clare MacLean.The economics department—which has one of the highest student-to-faculty ratios—introduced the 16-person courses three years ago as a result of a College-wide push to increase student interaction with faculty members. “The student-teacher ratio is well out of whack,” said Sendhil Mullainathan, an economics professor who also taught a seminar this fall.Recent departures have worsened the situation. In the past few weeks, the department has lost several faculty members to the Obama administration. Former University President Lawrence H. Summers, who was slated to co-teach a junior seminar this spring, left to head the President’s National Economic Council. Professor David M. Cutler ’87 departed to work with Obama on health care policy, and Professor Jeremy C. Stein joined Summers at the NEC. Visiting Professor Owen A. Lamont and Professor Raj Chetty have replaced Stein and Cutler, respectively, but department members said they are still anxious about the hiring slowdown.“If economics is going to remain as popular as it has been for the last 20 years, we need to have more faculty resources in order to provide the educational experience that would be more comparable to what other departments are able to,” said Economics Professor Benjamin M. Friedman.Next year, the department plans to open courses that were formerly seminars to a higher number of students. thus eliminating their 16-student caps and losing their seminar designation.Junior seminars are non-required courses “designed to introduce students to research in a particular field of economics,” according to the course catalogue. While only a fraction of the 238 current junior economics concentrators have elected to take the courses, enrollment is not guaranteed. This semester, 97 students lotteried for 48 slots, according to Jeana Lee, an undergraduate course assistant.“I thought it was one of the best experiences I had in the econ department,” said James S. Williams ’10. “There was tremendous opportunity for interaction with the professor.”—Staff writer Noah S. Rayman can be reached at nrayman@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Elyssa A.L.

Law School Professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Law School lecturer Stephanie Robinson have been chosen as the new masters of Winthrop House, and the first black House Masters in Harvard history, College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds announced yesterday afternoon.They will assume their new posts next fall, replacing Professor Stephen P. Rosen and Mandana Sassanfar, who called it quits after six years as the Winthrop House Masters, citing personal reasons for the decision.The pick comes as part of a recent push by Hammonds to foster greater diversity among House Masters, a group that contains few minority members.In an interview last December, the Dean said that she hopes to usher minority faculty into recently opened House Master positions.The selection fills one of two recent vacancies. In November, Pforzheimer House Masters Sue and James J. McCarthy announced their intention to step down after 13 years in the Quad. Even though the McCarthys announced their retirement about two months before Rosen and Sassanfar, their replacements have not yet been named.  As is typical among House Masters, both Sullivan and Robinson have earned distinctions in a wide range of academic and professional pursuits. Sullivan is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Morehouse College. He has worked in Kenya, documenting human rights violations, and served as the Director for the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia. Though he was a new faculty member at Yale Law School, Sullivan received the award for outstanding teaching in his first year. Currently, he directs the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute. Robinson, a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Maryland, was named one of Ebony Magazine’s 30 young African American leaders of the future in 1997. She presently serves as CEO of The Jamestown Project, a national think-tank compromised primarily of minorities and women that focuses on democracy.  The couple—both HLS graduates who also run the Robinson Sullivan consulting group—has one son, Ronald III. Though House Committee members are formally incorporated in the Master selection process, Winthrop HoCo Chair William C. Quinn ’10 said the extent of his involvement in Sullivan and Robinson’s selection was limited.He added that he looks forward to welcoming the couple into the Winthrop House community.“They have a similar laid-back style [to Rosen and Sassanfar],” Quinn said. “They seem very interested...in House life.”   Among the 24 sitting House Masters, at least one of the two Masters in each House has served as a professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. But neither Sullivan nor Robinson had taught at the College prior to their selection, a fact that reflects both the high selectivity of the process and the limited pool of minority candidates among College faculty. In an interview with The Crimson on Monday, Hammonds said a third set of House Masters would announce plans to step down during the next academic year. Sullivan and Robinson did not return requests for comment last night.—Staff writer Bita M.

This Valentine’s Day, thousands of Harvard students will discover their soulmate—or at least the ten likely soulmate candidates determined by Harvard Computer Society’s match-making service, Datamatch.Those looking for love or just a little amusement answer 30 questions about topics such as past relationships, current events, and which Harvard classroom most represents their sex life.“I logged onto Datamatch just because the questions were hilarious,” Winston S. Hill ’12, said. “I’m going to e-mail them to everyone I know.”HCS President Keito Uchiyama ’11, said that although the questions were not scored based on psychological science, the algorithm is effective in pairing compatible students. To match participants, members of the Harvard Computer Society score each question based on personality traits. The results are then run through a secret computer algorithm.“We use a very complex and mysterious algorithm that no one really knows anything about,” HCS Vice President of Communications Hanzi Zhang ’12, said. Datamatch 2009 marks the service’s 16th continuous year of operation. This year, HCS has launched new features that allow users to change their answers until the deadline, and also updated the Web site for a more modern look.Students who answer the questionnaire by February 13th at 11:59 p.m. will receive their top ten closest matches in an e-mail on Valentine’s Day.“We like that there is a sense of doubt about whether the people you’re matched with are really accurate...it could just be random,” Zhang said.Most students view Datamatch as innocent fun, and do not expect to find the perfect mate through the service. Jessica M. Righthand ’09 said she participated in Datamatch as a freshman and was contacted by one of her matches. “I think it’s entertaining…but I wouldn’t take it seriously,” she said.Righthand said she did not respond to the match that contacted her.Former HCS President Joshua A. Kroll ’09, said he has heard of love stories that blossomed from Datamatch. In fact, Kroll himself was matched with his then-girlfriend when he took the survey.“I would say the matches were a good validation that the program is running smoothly,” he said. “It’s always important to us that people are happy.”Some students, however, think that Datamatch contributes to the general societal trend of declining face-to-face interaction.“I think that for shy people, it’s okay [to use Datamatch]. But it might not be the right way morally—you’re not really showing people your real characteristics,” Nikola Ivica ’12 said. “Personally, I think it’s always better to meet in person.”

The No. 2 Harvard Women’s Squash team (8-1, 5-1 Ivy) put an exclamation point on an exemplary season with a 6-3 victory over rival No. 5 Yale (9-4, 3-4 Ivy) Wednesday evening at the Barnaby Courts to close out the regular season.The victory helped assuage a heartbreaking 5-4 defeat to No. 1 Princeton last weekend and restored positive momentum to the team as it prepares to host the Howe Cup Championship this weekend.With No. 1 sophomore June Tiong already out with an injury, Crimson Coach Satinder Bajwa took a risk resting No. 3 freshman Emily Park as a precaution heading into the championship weekend, but his coaching paid off.“It was tough to leave Emily out, but in the end I had to take responsibility and just say, ‘well, blame me,’” Bajwa said.“We keep telling ourselves that we have a team that anybody can be missing and we can still play well,” he added. “The girls have the ability and the belief to keep stepping up.”That is not to say that it was easy­­—six out of the nine matches went to a decisive fifth set.A thrilling 3-2 victory at No. 8 by junior Sandra Mumanachit was offset early by an equally heartbreaking defeat at the No. 3 spot. Junior Katherine O’Donnell had a 2-1 edge over the Bulldogs’ Alia Aziz and was on the cusp of closing out a 9-0 undefeated season. However, she was unable to put her talented opponent away, dropping the fourth game 4-9 and a marathon fifth 7-9.A 3-2 victory by No. 4 sophomore Bethan Williams was offset by a 3-2 defeat at No. 7 with sophomore Alexandra Zindman falling 8-10, 9-6, 7-9, 10-8, 9-2, to Tara Wadhwa of Yale. Playing three spots above her customary No. 7 flight, Williams’ performance is indicative of the depth and talent of the entire Harvard squad.“We have a very strong team. They proved that they are better than the position they play,” No. 1 freshman Nirasha Guruge said.No. 2 sophomore Alisha Mashruwala chalked another one up for the Crimson with a come-from-behind five-game nailbiter. After taking the first set in short order, 9-1, Mashruwala’s play turned shaky and she dropped the next two 9-5 and 9-6. However, excellent scrambling and fast reflexes in the front court earned her a 10-9 victory in the fourth set. The final set was no contest as Mashruwala pulled away 9-5 to take the match 3-2 and raise her career five-game match record to 4-0.Guruge capped the evening off at the No. 1 flight with an impressive five-game performance against the Bulldogs’ Logan Greer. After quickly falling behind 2-0, Guruge turned her match around in the final three sets.“I was just making too many mistakes in the first two sets and went into the third telling myself that I just can’t afford to make any more or I’ll lose the match,” she said. “I started playing deeper and safer, and it just came to me.”Opening the third set, Guruge came out swinging, pounding winners all across the court—and pounding her opponent with an errant forehand that left a golf-ball sized bruise. Guruge took a tight third game 9-8 and, against a dispirited Greer, ran away with the fourth and fifth games, 9-6 and 9-5, to take the match 3-2 and record her first career victory at the top flight.A one-sided 9-5, 9-0, 9-0 victory by rising star freshman Cece Cortes at the No. 6 spot and an efficient 3-1 win by No. 5 junior captain Johanna Snyder offset an early 3-0 loss by No. 9 freshman Elizabeth Shuman to turn the final score in the Crimson’s favor.With an 8-1 regular season record, a second place Ivy League finish, and home-court advantage, Harvard will likely be the team to beat in this weekend’s Howe Cup. The tournament opens Friday at the Barnaby Courts and runs through Sunday.The Crimson’s main competition this weekend will be Princeton, who narrowly defeated Harvard 4-5 at home on Sunday. “You could call [the loss to Princeton] just a bit of a hiccup,” Bajwa said. “I truly believe that if they carry on the way they played today that the National Title is within their grasp.”—Staff writer Barrett P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It might be hard to believe, but there is something better than the butternut squash soup served in the dining halls on Tuesdays. That’s the squash being served up by Harvard men’s squash star Colin West. With only one match remaining in the regular season—against rival Yale this Wednesday—the junior stands almost undefeated with an impressive 8-1 individual record.Last week, West defeated Trinity’s Gustav Detter in an exciting four-game battle. West—ranked fourth at the time—topped the nation’s second best player 3-1 (10-8, 9-4, 2-9, 9-2). Since that win, West has suffered his only loss of the season—3-0 (9-1, 9-2, 9-1) to Princeton’s Mauricio Sanchez.  The moment West stepped onto the court to face Detter, Harvard had already lost its first eight matches of the day to the Bantams, who hold the longest winning streak of any American college team in intercollegiate sports with 183 wins in a row. What factors contributed to West’s victory? Talent? Plenty. Determination? Ditto. But, most importantly, selflessness and humility—two qualities that are inversely related to the big egos (and high salaries) often found in athletics today. West is not new to success on the court. He was voted Ivy League Rookie of the Year as a freshman in 2007 and was an All-American in his sophomore season. This year, West has improved upon last year’s 8-3 record in the top spot. “It’s been a big season for me,” West admitted. “Last year, there was still a big gap between me and the top guys. This year, its finally closing, and I feel like I’m right up there with them.”Interpret “big gap” however you like, but West was ranked #6 in the nation last year.Even before arriving at Harvard, West was no stranger to intense competition. Like any good Canadian, the Toronto native was skating by age four. By age eight, West was juggling hockey practices and junior circuit squash tournaments. While he participated in both sports until he was 16, squash was always the more exciting of the two. “For some reason, in squash, the wins were bigger, the losses were worse, West said. “In hockey, I wasn’t quite as devastated by the losses. I think I’m more wired for an individual sport. I just felt so much more passion for it.” And his passion he followed. By age 13, West was competing in the U.S Junior Open. By 15, he was swinging his racquet at the World Juniors in New Zealand. Fast forward to the present, and the 20-year-old is just shy of the top collegiate ranking in the U.S. His win against Detter is one of the best of his life. “For me especially, getting a chance to play the second best player in the country, I knew I wouldn’t get that many shots. You have to perform,” West said of the victory. Though it was their first matchup, it wasn’t just about West and Detter that day. Nor was it solely a matter of winning and losing. While West probably has a trophy case that looks like King Midas’s G.I. Joe collection, he couldn’t stop talking about his team. “In college squash, you get few opportunities to make something big happen,” West said. “We’d been preparing for a long time for this match. It’s not just an individual thing.” Though the final outcome was already decided by the time he took the court, West said he was motivated to earn a win for his teammates, whom he repeatedly credits for his success. “College is the best of both worlds. I get to have the individual aspect, where it’s on me, but I still get to play for a team. There’s extra motivation: training with a team of guys, who are teammates, but also some of your best friends on campus.”Head Coach Santinder Bajwa spoke volumes of the maturity and cohesion of his team. His players create a supportive, positive atmosphere in which they all can blossom as people as well as athletes, he said. “Sometimes, great players bring a team together. Sometimes, twwwhe team makes a great player,” Bajwa said.It is valuable, he believes, for any athlete to experience an individual sport that is also a team sport. West in particular will benefit from his college experience. “Colin is one of those kids that you get every three or four years,” says Bajwa. “He enjoys not just performing for himself, but performing for a collective group of people that he cares for.” Bajwa also looks forward to West’s professional aspirations: “In the long run, he wants to play professionally for a year or two and see how he does. The team is going to make him whole.”With the CSA National Team Championships coming up next week and the CSA Individual Championships coming up in two, men’s squash as well as West have a lot to look forward to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite tenacious efforts up and down the lineup, the Crimson suffered back-to-back losses for the first time this year, falling to Yale 6-3.After a weekend split against Ivy rivals Princeton and Penn, the Harvard men’s squash team (6-4, 3-3 Ivy League) returned to the Barnaby Courts last night for its final regular-season match, hosting the third-ranked and archrival Bulldogs (13-2, 5-1). Yale promised to be a formidable opponent, showing energy and confidence as a result of winning five of their last six contests, and delivered with three matches in straight sets. However, the night began in high spirits for the Crimson, as it was Senior Day for Verdi DiSesa, Niko Hrdy and Ned Reeves.Hrdy—seeded at four this week—gave a very impressive showing in one of the three opening matches, swiftly beating his opponent, John Roberts, in three straight games 9-5, 9-4, 9-7. Hrdy, a stand-out this season for Harvard, continued to excite the fans with his skill and composure.Possibly the most exciting opening performance though, came from junior Richard Hill, seeded sixth for the match. Hill took his opponent to five sets 9-2, 4-9, 9-5, 6-9, 9-0, winning his first, third, and final game.“I was a little annoyed blowing a 5-0 lead” said Hill, “but before the final game I finally asked myself if I was going to win this.”Hill battled through his five games, proving to be a daunting opponent, not giving up one point in the final game.“I fought for every point up until the last point at 8-0. I saw my lead but still realized anything can happen.”Hill ended his regular-season with an overall record of 8-2.Not to be outdone, sophomore and fifth seed J. Reed Endresen lost no steam replacing Hill on court number two. The second-year player showed no fatigue after tough weekend matches, dominating the opening game en route to a 9-1 win, but faltered by dropping his next two. Faced with an uphill battle, Endresen claimed the fourth game, setting up a pivotal final frame. The sophomore stumbled to a 0-5 deficit before finding his rhythm and climbing back to a 10-8 victory.“It felt pretty good to win the game,” Endresen said. “Last year we played Yale at Nationals, and unfortunately I lost, so it was a very nice revenge for me. I played to win for the seniors today.”Despite the Senior Day festivities, some of the fourth-years fell on hard luck. Co-captain DiSesa was relentless and refused to let up during his own five-game match. After losing his first two games by a small margin, DiSesa battled back against Yale opponent Todd Ruth. Although his first successful game had to go to ten, he fought back to prove himself in the fourth game, getting nine straight points to tie the match at 2-2.In the decisive frame, both competitors battled fiercely, exchanging seemingly endless rallies with the score knotted at 5-5.In the end, Ruth was victorious, needing all ten points to overcome DiSesa.Trailing 2-4, the Crimson needed stellar efforts from the final three competitors, but came up short. Junior Frank Cohen and sophomore Eliot Buchanon fell in straight games 9-1, 9-4, 9-7, and 9-5, 9-5, 9-4 respectively sealing a win for the Bulldogs.Although the team came up short, junior top seed Colin West rebounded from a weekend loss to Princeton’s Mauricio Sanchez with a 3-0 victory.Yale’s John Fulham put up little resistance, as West dropped only three total points in a 9-2, 9-1, 9-0 drubbing of the Bulldogs top player. The third-year standout finished the season with a 9-1 record and looks to stand among the Nation’s best at Harvard’s helm as the post-season approaches.Despite a disappointing end to the regular season, the Crimson’s playoff prospects remain bright. Harvard will travel to Princeton, N.J. for the CSA National Team Championships as the fifth overall seed, looking to improve on their next trip to New Jersey.In order to gear up for the year’s final tournament, the Crimson will look to take advantage of well-deserved time off.Hill stressed the importance of recovery time, as the squad prepares for rigorous back-to-back matches in two weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The courtship has officially begun in Ivy League men’s basketball. The first Ivy Weekend is packed with exciting matchups for the Crimson (10-10, 2-4 Ivy). Harvard travels to Ithaca, New York today to face Cornell (15-7, 5-1 Ivy) in the two teams’ first meeting of the season. The Crimson then rounds out the Empire State road trip by traveling to New York City for a Valentine’s Day faceoff with Columbia (8-12, 3-3). 
The men’s squad heads into the trying weekend with momentum on its side. After suffering a four game losing streak Harvard was led by junior Jeremy Lin in a stunning last-second victory over the Brown Bears (6-14, 0-6 Ivy) on Saturday. With 22 second-half points and 27 overall, Lin drew a foul on a jump shot just before the buzzer. He then hit the game winning foul shot to give Harvard a 64-63 advantage and renewed life in Ivy league play. 
Harvard faces a significant challenge in facing Cornell. When Harvard dueled the Big Red at the end of last season, the Crimson was pummeled in a 33-point loss in Ithaca.
This year, Cornell is currently undefeated at home. To win in Ithaca, the Crimson will have to contain Big Red juniors Ryan Wittman and Louis Dale. The 6’6” Wittman averages 18.3 points per game this season and shoots almost 40% from beyond the arch. Dale is also dangerous from beyond the arch, averaging 14.4 points per game and shooting almost 47% from three point range.   
“Our focus is playing our brand of team defense—contest passes, make it tough for them to run the offense,” captain Andrew Pusar said. “Especially for [Wittman and Dale], we want to make it difficult for them.”
In addition to controlling Cornell’s offensive threats, Harvard will have to be effective in the paint and come down with some boards. To Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, presence and ball control are key.
“How can we scrap, claw, do a better job of boxing out?” Amaker said. “Can we be a little tougher defensively? Can we not allow the ball to get into the post? That’s both sides, that’s outside and inside players on defense.”
Making note of the team’s 6-4 road record, Amaker believes that the Crimson’s experience in winning away from Lavietes will be key in both games this weekend. He also believes that Harvard’s dramatic win this past weekend should be inspirational to the team. 
“We’re hopeful that it’s going to give us an opportunity to gain confidence,” Amaker said.
Pusar believes that road games are just what the team needs to light the fire.
“This is the first Ivy weekend, so the crowds will be hooting and hollering against us, and we want to feed off that.”
“It’s a test because Cornell is Cornell—one of the best teams in the league,” senior forward Evan Harris said. “But we love to play in the hostile environment…at Cornell, the fans are right on top of you, yelling, and it should make it a good game.”
Harris recently returned from a knee injury, putting up a double-double against Brown on Saturday. He feels confident in his preparedness for the weekend.
“My knee feels good,” Harris said. “I’ve had three days off, so hopefully I’ll be ready by Friday.”
Harris and the rest of the Squad will have to be ready as they prepare to enter the Newman Arena, which will likely be filled with more than 2000 rowdy Cornell fans.
Harvard will follow the same simple recipe against both opponents: execute. Lin will be key to putting points on the board. Harris, along with freshman Keith Wright, will have to continue to rebound well. Columbia has a consistent, deep bench and good inside presence, so Harvard must also focus on minimizing turnovers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, I predicted that things might become more clear in the Ivies—the best would rise to the top, the worst would show their true colors. 
I was wrong. The crap hit the proverbial fan last weekend in Ivy League men’s basketball, and out of the rubble, three contenders remain: Princeton (9-8, 4-0 Ivy), Cornell (15-7, 5-1 Ivy), and Dartmouth (6-14, 4-2 Ivy).
That’s right, Princeton—which was picked last in the Ivy League Preseason poll—is now in first place. Dartmouth, the team picked just ahead of the Tigers at the beginning of the year, is in third. Normally, I would chuck the lack of a clear-cut number one in the league to poor research by the Ivy officials.
But at least the experts got Cornell right.
Harvard beat then-No.24 Boston College—after that team had taken out the No.1 team in the country, UNC.
Yale has some talented low post players, and Columbia is a good young team. Penn is young, but looked like a serious threat in the Ivies after some strong play early.
Those programs seemed like logical picks to round out the top of the Ivy standings, while the rest of the league looked to be suffering from youth or just lack of talent.
But junior Alex Barnett has been sensational for Dartmouth, and Princeton is just playing out of its mind. 
On Friday night, the Tigers did not just beat Cornell, they shellacked them, 61-41. And then on Saturday, against Columbia—the team I called the clear No.2 last week—it wasn’t even close, as Princeton held the Lions to 11 points, yes 11 points in the first half en route to a 63-35 beatdown.
Those aren’t just wins, those are big time season-changers.
Can you imagine the confidence the Tigers have, as they travel to Brown and Yale this weekend?
But then again, I’ve been wrong before. You know the drill, Friday’s games predicted first, followed by Saturday’s. 

HARVARD at CORNELL
The Crimson was lucky to get the monkey off its back and break its recent slide when it did—at home against measly Brown. To his credit, coach Tommy Amaker made a good call in switching to a more pressing defense in the second half, and he said he didn’t panic at halftime.
The result: Harvard shut down the Bear’s guards on the defensive end and the team started making shots on the other.
Check that, junior phenom Jeremy Lin scored 22 in the second half, including his free throw as time expired that sent the Crimson to a much-needed 64-63 win.
Now, Harvard is still in the race, but just barely. It’s desperation time now as the squad must sweep arguably its toughesroad trip of the season.
Don’t be fooled by the Big Red’s performance against Princeton. Look to the next night for the real deal, as the squad went to the Palestra and dominated Penn 88-73. Wittman posted a game-high 21 points, and the team is confident coming back home. 
Cornell 75, Harvard 63
DARTMOUTH at COLUMBIA
Now we’ll see what the Big Green is really made of. Dartmouth leaves the friendly confines of its small New Hampshire town for a heaping helping of the Big Apple. Columbia had an up-and-down weekend as it took down Penn (which is struggling mightily these days), but then choked at Princeton. Barnett has the capabilities to score 35 points, so the Lions better score on Friday. This is a toss-up, but I really expect Dartmouth to come down from its recent high against a good Lions squad. Let’s not forget—it’s on the road.
Columbia 58, Dartmouth, 54
PRINCETON at YALE
I really have no idea with this game. Last weekend, Princeton looked phenomenal, but can the team keep it up on the road?
Yale crushed Harvard, which played miserably, but then fell to Dartmouth in a game it needed to win to get into third place in the Ivies. Which Bulldog team will show up?  Yale will have the advantage at home, and I’m sticking to my guns: Princeton can’t be this good. Can it?
Yale 66, Princeton 62
PENN at BROWN
Look who’s on a tough three-game skid and sitting near the bottom of the Ivies? Your Penn Quakers! And you know what, it will not be getting any easier for sophomore Tyler Bernardini and company. Brown has two players—junior Matt Mullery and sophomore Peter Sullivan—who work a lethal one-two combination for the Bears. I think the squad can get a game this season—just not this one.
Penn 60, Brown 55
HARVARD at COLUMBIA
Columbia is going to be drained from a tough match-up against Dartmouth. Harvard most likely won’t be in the Cornell match for too long, so the Crimson may have more legs for this match-up.
Columbia doesn’t offer many match-up problems for Harvard down low, and if senior Evan Harris can keep it going, the team may pull out this game. Although I tell myself: never trust your instincts on Harvard, my gut says they got to win this one.
Harvard 72, Columbia 69
PENN at YALE
I’ll make it brief: this is a total tossup. I just flipped a coin—25 times. Winner: Yale.
Yale 13, Penn 12
PRINCETON at BROWN
If Princeton is undefeated by the time this weekend is out, I’m going crazy. But I already predicted Yale would beat them, so the squad can take care of the stinky Bears.
Princeton 54, Brown 45
DARTMOUTH at CORNELL
I will never pick anyone to beat Cornell. Tigers, prove me wrong in three weeks. I defy you!
Cornell 77, Dartmouth 55
RECORD LAST WEEK: 3-5-0  (To date: 3-5-0)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cornell and Columbia’s trips to Cambridge last year turned the Ivy League season on its head.
If this weekend’s games are anything like the ones in 2008, Friday and Saturday night will provide a whole lot of excitement for those who make it across the river to Lavietes.
Harvard (12-7, 4-1 Ivy) will face Cornell (7-11, 3-3) today and then Columbia (10-10, 3-3) tomorrow. The two teams are currently breathing down the Crimson’s neck in the league standings, and both games will be vital to the teams involved.
On February 29 last season, Harvard squeaked by a determined Columbia Lions team looking to play spoiler. The same night that the Crimson came away with the 71-70 victory, Dartmouth defeated then-league-leading Cornell, putting Harvard into a tie with the Big Red for first place in the Ivies.
The following night, the two teams met in a game that was essentially billed as the conference final. The Crimson pulled out another dramatic victory, winning 51-48 in front of a massive home crowd.
Harvard’s 2008 dreams of playing in the NCAA Tournament, however, were not to be, as the Crimson suffered a loss to Yale on the final day of the season, and were subsequently beaten by Dartmouth in the three-team playoff. Still, Harvard came out of the Columbia/Cornell weekend with two huge wins that seemed to set it up for an Ivy championship and a spot in the tournament.
In 2009, the rivals will come to Cambridge earlier in the season, but the games are just as important as those of last year.
The Crimson certainly has not forgotten the glory of 2008’s victories and the way it played in two games.
“We try to use the passion and emotion that we had from previous years’ games,” co-captain Niki Finelli said. “But it’s a new season and a new team, and you cannot rely on last year’s play for this years game.”
Harvard comes into the weekend riding a four-game win streak. Back-to-back weekend road trips did not trouble the Crimson, as the team responded positively after its opening home loss to Dartmouth.
In the latest victory, Harvard dominated Brown 71-46. Freshman point guard Brogan Berry led all scorers with 17 points the night after her 18-point performance against Yale. Her play in the two games earned her Ivy League Co-Player of the Week honors. Berry has also been named Ivy League Rookie of the week five times this season.
“She’s a really talented and poised point guard,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said of Berry. “She’s got a great court IQ, is able to penetrate, and is quite deceptive; she’s smart, strong, and quick, has a mid-range jumper, can shoot the three, and we often put her up against the toughest player on the other team.”
The Crimson will need her to be on her game against two very tough opponents.
One thing that remains the same from Harvard’s meeting with Cornell at the end of last season is that the Big Red will be playing without Jeomi Maduka. Maduka, perhaps the league’s best player in 2008, missed the March 1 matchup to participate in a track and field meet. This year, Maduka decided to give up her Big Red basketball career for good.
So far, Cornell has been able to cope without their star. But whether the team can continue to be the powerhouse that it has been in recent years remains to be seen.
The absence of Maduka might change the Crimson’s gameplan, but it certainly won’t change its attitude going into the contest. Harvard knows that the Big Red will still come prepared for a fight. Cornell leads the league in three-pointers made as well as three-point percentage, and also has some power down low with senior Shanna Scarselletta.
“It doesn’t change our mentality towards them,” Finelli said. “It’s going to be important to play to our strengths and use our inside game well.”
That inside game includes the team’s leading scorer, sophomore Emma Markley. Markley is averaging nearly 13 points and seven boards per game. And sophomore Claire Wheeler will look to help out her teammate on the glass down low.
Saturday night, the Crimson will face a much tougher Columbia team than it beat a year ago. The Lions have a very physical and athletic squad that loves to run. They could look to pressure Berry and co-captain Emily Tay in the backcourt, making it difficult for the Harvard guards when bringing the ball up the floor. 
The Crimson will get their first look at Columbia’s Julie Lomax, who transferred from Oregon State this year. The sophomore forward leads her team in scoring, averaging over 14 points per game.
While Harvard comes into the weekend with some momentum, the team is still struggling to put together complete games.
“I’m happy with the four wins on the road, but I think we can play better, especially from the start of games,” Delaney-Smith said.
They will need to if they want to extend their unbeaten streak to eight.
“It’s a matter of putting 40 minutes together, starting strong from the tip and continuing our play until the final buzzer,” Finelli said.
