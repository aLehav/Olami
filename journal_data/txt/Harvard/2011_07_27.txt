After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard students have started a petition calling on the University to sever ties with Subramanian Swamy, a Harvard Summer School economics instructor who wrote an op-ed against Islamic terrorism that many have called offensive and inflammatory.
In an article published July 16 in the Indian newspaper Daily News and Analysis, Swamy recommended demolishing hundreds of mosques, disenfranchising non-Hindus who do not acknowledge their alleged Hindu ancestry, and banning conversion from Hinduism.
The op-ed came in response to a series of bombings in Mumbai that killed 23 on July 13.
“The first lesson to be learnt from the recent history of Islamic terrorism against India and for tackling terrorism in India is that the Hindu is the target and that Muslims of India are being programmed by a slow reactive process to become radical and thus slide into suicide against Hindus,” Swamy wrote.
His op-ed spurred over 200 people to sign a petition condemning Swamy and calling on Harvard to end its relationship with him.
“These are statements you’d expect a demagogue on the extreme right to say,” Umang Kumar, a student at Harvard Divinity School, said, “but a professor who comes here, who got his Ph.D. from Harvard?”
Kumar and Sanjay J. Pinto, a Ph.D. candidate in sociology and social policy, organized the petition with a small group of peers and then emailed it out to an initial group of 80 students.
“Both of us decided we really needed to take action,” Pinto said. “His comments are wrong on many levels. They put forth a vision of Indian society in which not all religious groups are welcome, which is very different from the India that both of us know.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Swamy said that he is a religiously tolerant person.
“I can’t condemn all Muslims. I’m not against them,” Swamy said. “I never said Muslims as a whole are terrorists.”
However, the petition accuses Swamy of using the July 13 bombings to write a piece that is inflammatory towards Muslims.
“Swamy has exploited this event not only to promote a vision of Indian society based on Hindu supremacy, but to disparage and cast suspicion on the entire Muslim community in India,” the petition states.
At the Summer School, Swamy teaches Economics S-110: “Quantitative Methods in Economics and Business” and Economics S-1316: “Economic Development in India and East Asia.”
In a statement sent by a spokesperson, Donald H. Pfister, the dean of Harvard Summer School, said that the school will examine the issue.
“At this point we have only a basic awareness of the situation and have not been contacted by the organizations involved," Pfister said. "Professor Swamy is a long-time member of the Harvard Summer School faculty who previously was a member of the Department of Economics here. We will give this matter our serious attention."
Pinto and Kumar plan to deliver their petition to the Harvard administration early next week.
“Swamy draws a lot of prestige and legitimacy from his position at Harvard,” Pinto said. “If the Hindu right were to come into power in India, he could very well be someone who takes up a position in government, so I think it’s important for members of this community to play a part in discrediting him and saying, ‘No, he does not represent us.’”
In India, Swamy leads the Janata party, a political party that held the majority of India’s Parliament decades ago but has since fragmented. At Harvard, he earned his Ph.D. in economics in 1965 and has served as an assistant and associate professor.
Swamy said that the Indian response to his op-ed has been positive.
“I don’t think anyone in India, except the left wing, has been upset by my article,” he said. “There has been wholesale support.”
But the backers of the petition were hardly supportive of the piece.
“Not allowing Hindus to convert to any other religion, not allowing other groups to vote unless they proudly declare their Hindu ancestry—it’s honestly kind of absurd,” Pinto said.
Kumar and Pinto both said that while freedom of speech is an integral part of a thriving academic community like Harvard, Swamy’s comments crossed a line.
“They stereotype an entire population of people,” Pinto said. “How can this man who expresses these views, who’s basically saying that India should only be for Hindus and not for other people, and denigrating all Muslims, how can he teach students at Harvard?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professor Elizabeth Warren will return to Harvard Law School from Washington D.C. next month, the Treasury Department announced Tuesday.
News of Warren’s Harvard homecoming comes two weeks after President Obama announced that Warren had been passed over as the inaugural director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she is largely credited with creating.
Warren took leave from the Law School in 2010 to help create the bureau, which was drawn up by Congress in the wake of the economic crisis to more effectively regulate the financial industry.
“Professor Warren has done an extraordinary job standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her efforts to simplify mortgage and credit card disclosures, protect military families from abusive and deceptive financial practices, and bring aboard top talent like Richard Cordray and Raj Date have built a strong foundation for the Bureau’s future success,” Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said in a statement.
Warren may not be in Cambridge for long as Democratic Party leaders are trying to recruit Warren to run against Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown for his seat in the U.S. Senate in 2012.
Democrats say Warren could beat Brown because of her high-profile status and reputation as a fearless, straight-talking consumer rights' advocate. And as the leader of the effort to crack down on the financial industry, Warren has garnered high praise from Democrats and vehement criticism from Republicans.
Mere rumors of a Senate run has already led liberal groups to start stocking a political war chest; the Progressive Change Campaign Committee has raised more than $50,000 for Warren in the past few weeks.
In the meantime, Warren will join a plethora of Harvard professors and students who have served in the Obama Administration. Law School professors Laurence H. Tribe ’62 and Daniel J. Meltzer '72 returned to Harvard from the Obama Administration last year.
The announcement from the Treasury that Warren will return to Cambridge was part of an announcement regarding the transition process for the CFPB. According to the Treasury, Warren's deputy Raj Date will take over as special adviser to the bureau. Richard Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, has been tapped to lead the agency, but he is likely to face a tough confirmation fight in the Senate.
Republican Senators have said that they oppose the Obama administration's nominee unless the White House agrees to changes that would strip the bureau of some of its power.

CORRECTION: JULY 27, 2011
The July 27 article "Amid Senate Rumors, Warren Heads Back to Cambridge" incorrectly stated the Law School Professor Charles Fried worked in the Obama Administration. Fried was solicitor general during the Reagan administration.
