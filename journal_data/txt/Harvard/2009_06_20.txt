After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Joining a recent trend of schools endorsing open access scholarship, faculty at the Harvard Graduate School of Education voted overwhelmingly earlier this month to make their scholarly articles available to the public free of charge.Under the new policy, faculty articles will now be circulated through the online Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard repository now being developed by the Office for Scholarly Communication. Though currently in testing stages and available only within the University, the database is expected to opened to the general public by late summer or early fall. Faculty members will have the option of blocking public access to articles they write.This move at GSE follows similar policies already approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Law School, the Kennedy School, and a smattering of peer universities including MIT and the Stanford School of Education.According to John W. Collins III, GSE Librarian, allowing open access is universally beneficial. He said it will improve the quality of education worldwide, circulate faculty members’ works, and facilitate scholarly dialogue. He added that the decision has received a positive response from students and people outside the University.Professor Stuart M. Shieber, faculty director of the Office for Scholarly Communication, said he perceived no drawbacks to the new policy.“It is fundamental to the role of the university in society that access should be as broad as possible,” he said.But he added that some people believe open access is unviable because they think it could affect the business model of subscription-based journals, an idea he called “misguided” in a blog post on the topic.While some faculty members declined to comment because they said they did not feel knowledgeable enough about the new policy, Professor Paul K. Harris said he was pleased with the decision to allow open access.“I’m positive about it. I think it will allow faculty to make their publications more easily available,” he said.In a continuation of its efforts to disseminate faculty members’ scholarly work, the Office for Scholarly Communication has begun a dialogue with all Harvard schools to consider approving open access policies.—Staff writer Niha S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the American Medical Student Association flunked Harvard Medical School last year for failing to submit its conflict of interest policies for review, school officials hastened to turn in the paperwork this year—and got a B.Earlier this week, AMSA released its third annual PharmFree Scorecard, which evaluates conflict of interest policies against industry influence at U.S. medical schools. This year's report evaluated policies at 149 schools according to 11 categories, including gifts, free samples, and other compensation—all possible areas of conflict with pharmaceutical companies.Harvard Medical School also came under fire last year following allegations by U.S. Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, that psychiatrist Joseph Biederman of Harvard-affiliated Mass. General Hospital received $1.6 million in consulting and speaking fees from the makers of drugs he had used to treat children for bipolar disorder.This year, the Medical School sent in its existing policy—which is currently under review—as well as the conflict of interest policies at both Harvard-affiliate Children's Hospital Boston and at Partners Healthcare, a non-profit that owns Harvard-affiliates Mass. General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital.The school embarked on a review of its conflict of interest policy this January in conjunction with Harvard's ongoing efforts to develop University-wide recommendations and guidelines. The 19-member committee—which, unlike past review committees, includes students—is charged with reviewing current policy and revamping regulations for disclosing financial interests and industry ties. The last such review took place in 2004.Though this year's grade does not take into consideration the committee's ongoing efforts, Medical School spokesman David J. Cameron said that it "more accurately reflects" the school's commitment to holding its conflict of interest policies to high standards.Conflict of interest issues drew particular national spotlight over the last year as Grassley charged several prominent researchers at Stanford and Emory, among other instituitons, with failing to disclose millions in compensation from drug companies.The heightened attention prompted many medical schools nationwide to take a closer look at existing conflict of interest policies. Allan Coukell, director of the Pew Prescription Project, which co-created the Scorecard, credits both increased awareness and strong leadership at the schools with improving PharmFree scores this year. Of the 149 schools evaluated, 45 received A's or B's—which Coukell said reflected "good, serious policies"—16 up from last year."I do think that there are some medical school deans who realize the image of the profession has been tarnished," Coukell said. "There's a trend in the right direction, but there are still a lot of schools that have not addressed this issue."—Staff writer June Q. Wu can be reached at junewu@fas.harvard.edu.
