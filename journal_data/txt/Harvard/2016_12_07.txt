After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In two weeks, I will board a plane home to a country the leadership of this country has deemed a "very, very vital problem." At some point, I will be asked to retrieve my passport and present it to airport security for inspection. This time around, I will be more aware of how green it is. I will be more cognizant of the "Islamic Republic of Pakistan" branded onto it. When I return in January, if I am able to, the President-elect will have dropped the elect from his title and have unimaginable power at his disposal. The thought terrorizes me. I am angered that uncertainty and fear are once again uninvited guests in my life. While I was convinced I had successfully escaped the perils of unpredictability, the phrase “stay safe” has somehow managed to follow me. From marginalized minority to marginalized minority, I’m not quite impressed with the progress I’ve made. So, amidst times like these, a bubble is exactly where I want to be.
My father, an avid reader of my column, wrote to me last week. “Great job”, he complimented. “I have but one suggestion. Stay away from politics.” I smiled at his dad-like advice, albeit nervously. “I want to,” I thought to myself. In truth, however, it is the politics that refuses to stay away from me, much like everyone else. And, it’s always bad politics. The dirty kind. The inherently sad kind. The politics seeps into my skin and no amount of scrubbing removes it; its only emancipation comes through expression, though this requires bravery depending on what’s being expressed, where, and to whom. In the wake of intolerant atmospheres, policing myself comes naturally, for I am often on the periphery of what is deemed acceptable. It was at Harvard that I began unlearning that.
“Harvard’s such a bubble,” I hear all the time. “We need to break out of our echo chamber,” some utter. I nod to both statements with sincere agreement. But, I also cannot deny how indescribably grateful I am for this bubble. I know too well what uncertainty and unpredictability feel like, and what policing your thoughts, ideas, and opinions for a false sense of security tastes like.
In both America and Pakistan, I am somehow a minority. Within the Harvard enclosure, however, I leave in my drawer the minority label that hangs around my neck at home. I put on my Libertarian jacket that is sneered at for its “extremity” and deemed superfluous. While countries grapple with their inability to make their people feel safe, this bubble offers solace and security. It is here that in the Eliot Grille I can blast Sufi music that uses phrases demonized by Islamophobia, and not have people freak out or complain. I wonder if, at another American college, the act of playing music that doesn’t speak English would be endangering. It is here that I presuppose a degree of acceptance; I only fear that I’ll get accustomed to it, for I know the real world bears no resemblance to this liberal cocoon I revel in.
While I try hard not to take intellectualism for granted, I’m grateful for the like-minded people that surround me, the substantive conversations that arise at any moment, and how we coddle transformative ideas to fruition. It is here that I decide what kind of woman I want to be, and what values I want to embody without the sociocultural pressures and the expectations of my friends and family. It is here that I toss them anew every day into the Charles on my morning runs. It is here that I am told that my ideas matter, and it is on this campus that I have been able to exercise my voice that vicious intolerance exorcised out of me long ago. It is here that I can be a LGBTQ+ ally without question. It is here that my feminist identity is considered the norm. Harvard is at once my sanctuary and enabler. It is where I am most myself, intellectually, and physically. It is here that I feel free.
That is not to say that I absolve Harvard of its flaws. There are times it belongs more to some groups than others, the nuances of privilege forever informing how much space we can claim on campus. There is lots of work to be done, but I do take comfort in the fact that our college is at least attempting to be everyone’s.
As another semester draws to a close, I try to collect enough of Harvard to sustain myself over break. I take in the palette of autumn that streams through the Yard. I savor my HUDS meal without complaining. I graciously accept when tourists ask me to take their picture even if that means getting to class a couple of minutes late. I sit on the Widener steps and wait for the hour to arrive, engrossed in singing the language of the bells, while students hasten from class to class, exchanging pleasantries in the mere second they take to pass by each other, sputtering scripted responses, reinventing the efficacy of communication.
This place is too grand, too fast, too alive to keep up with, and I subconsciously concede that I will never be able to consume all it has to offer. But, I’ll be fine if I don’t get to meet every Nobel Laureate here and attend every talk that intrigues me as long as I have room to be my most genuine self.
When my plane lands in Boston at the end of January, I plan on unsheathing my armor and donning it with pride: the Harvard sweatshirt. My portable sanctuary. When I pass through border control, I plan on distracting skeptical eyes from the green with the crimson. Sure, I anticipate the bouts of privilege and guilt that I will experience, interchangeably, but, for once, I will not grimace about feeling protected: It is something everyone is entitled to but not everyone gets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I didn’t expect Donald Trump to be elected President of the United States. I hoped and prayed he would lose. Throughout the election cycle, I tried to remain detached from the endless fear and bigotry that seemed to spew out of the Trump political machine. For me, my parents, and my community, this election was too personal.
I am an undocumented immigrant, one of the many directly under threat in Donald Trump’s plan to deport all 11.5 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. In addition, I am a visa-overstayer—one of about 4.6 million that Trump has said he would prioritize in his deportation campaign. I’m terrified of my place in this country and am crippled by the seeming inevitability of the sweeping actions on immigration Trump has promised to the American people. He says he will cancel DACA, cancel funding to sanctuary cities, and deport me, my parents, and members of my community. But in the face of uncertainty and overwhelming despondency, I refuse to be silenced.
President-elect Trump directly threatens the physical and emotional wellbeing of me and all other undocumented people living in the US. His presidency is built on a fundamental misunderstanding of the immigration system, on the notion that the nation’s supposed vulnerability is the fault of undocumented immigrants, Muslims, and Latinos.
I don’t write to concede defeat in the face of bigotry—our community will not be silent as our families are separated and our livelihoods dismantled. Neither do I write to ask for Donald Trump’s pity or compassion when it comes to immigration. Rather, I write to make a case for how to move forward under President Trump. This is a call for action directed towards undocumented people, progressives, allies, and anyone else connected to our movement. I speak to my fellow undocumented Americans directly, but my message is for everyone:
Let us begin a dialogue with those who seek to suppress and deport us. I ask that we take on the difficult task of embracing those who wish to upend the lives we’ve built in this country. For many who celebrate Trump’s victory, this election is a reassertion of their belief that undocumented immigrants do not deserve a place in this country. Throughout the course of the election and the inflammatory rhetoric, these individuals have accepted these views as truth. It is counterproductive (and impossible) to insulate ourselves from these voices, especially now that their views have been legitimized by the President-elect himself. We must engage.
As undocumented immigrants, we don’t choose to be political; our lives are by definition political. Our immigration status is inextricably tied up in our identity, so that we cannot exist without drawing attention to the systems that define us, the systems on which this world—our world, the world we share with all those around us—is built. Just by living and breathing in America, we create pressure, we force reexamination, and therefore we are seen as a threat. Perhaps the hardest part of being undocumented is understanding that our futures depend on the worldviews and political leanings of other people. What are we to do when the abstract political rhetoric of others so dramatically shapes the reality of our lives, our very existence in this country?
We must begin by recognizing that now is not the time for comfortable conversation. Donald Trump has made immigration a toxic political flash point, rendering it near impossible to have a true and honest conversation about the issue. Nevertheless, we must face head-on the bigotry, the damaging language about our family members and neighbors, the xenophobia, and the proposals to build the wall. The answer is not to lash out in indignation or to make sweeping statements about the moral failures of others—Trump’s supporters use this as fuel to perpetuate their polluted narrative of the job-stealing, criminal immigrant. Instead, we must meet these sentiments with as much openness and respect as we can muster.
Let’s make this conversation our own again. Let’s make it about our families, their endurance, and their sacrifices. Let’s make it about our dreams, our hopes, and our aspirations—the real reasons we came to the United States. We must engage these voices and meet them where they are: Meet inaccuracy with truth, meet intolerance and prejudice with our lived experiences.
In her concession speech, Hillary Clinton asked us to “look to the future.” She said that “we owe [Donald Trump] an open mind and a chance to lead.” Keeping an open mind means something different for each of us. For me, it means not discounting the outcome of this election as the simple result of racism and xenophobia run wild. I will not turn away in disgust. Fear alone did not elect Donald Trump; uncomplicated ignorance cannot explain his success. I will engage with his electorate. I will seek to promote open, honest, compassionate conversation. We must pursue reciprocity—even if there seems to be no room for anything but intolerance. We must believe mutual understanding can be reached. This is not idealistic—it is the only way forward under the leadership of a President that may govern based on a platform of intolerance.
In his acceptance speech for the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, Martin Luther King Jr. argued that “unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality…[that] right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant.” What I’m asking for involves incredibly difficult conversations with people who don’t believe we have a place in this country. But we owe it to ourselves, to our families, and to our communities to elevate immigration and make it a more accessible conversation for everyone. Eventually, yes, love will trump hate. But only if we meet hatred—persistently, faithfully—with unarmed truth and relentless compassion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"Imagine." It was the best selling single of John Lennon's career.  That was 1971. Apollo 14 landed on the moon. At the same time, we were up to our necks in the morass of Vietnam. Lennon wrote, "You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us, and the world will be as one." We needed then, as now, an expansive imagination.  
The things we imagine and can't imagine change radically over the decades. For example, 45 years ago, in Lennon's time, no one at Harvard imagined women, let alone a gay couple, at the helm as Masters of Lowell House. Unimaginable. Not even in the realm of dreaming. There were no women Masters. Indeed, there was just an experimental sprinkling of women in the river houses.
As Dorothy Austin and I discuss the controversies of Harvard College with members of our Senior Common Room, especially the women, we hear of their experience of the unimaginable. Take Kitty Pechet, a renowned artist who is the widow of Maurice Pechet, one of the great Senior Tutors (now Resident Deans) of Lowell House. Kitty was the first woman to be allowed to sleep overnight (legally, she always adds) in Lowell House. That was in 1960. She and Maurice had eloped and after a few nights in a nearby hotel, she was invited by a reluctant House Master to live with her husband in his apartment in Lowell House. However, she was not allowed to eat with him in the Dining Hall, nor use the Library, nor walk around the courtyard, nor go in and out of the House unaccompanied except between 2 and 5 in the afternoon.
In 1963, Zeph Stewart, a Classics scholar, moved with his family into the Masters' residence of Lowell. His wife Diana was not allowed to eat in the Dining Hall, except on Friday evenings, Saturday lunch and dinner, and Sunday brunch. Of course, she did not accompany her husband to High Table, for there were no spouses at the High Table. Sometimes the wives of the Senior Common Room members had dinner with the wife of the Master in the Master's Residence, while their husbands dined in the Dining Hall, followed by cigars in the Senior Common Room.
When Kitty Pechet and Diana Stewart discuss these things today, students are astonished as if they were hearing the unimaginable tales of ancient times. They are equally astonished at the realization that women were not allowed to sit in Appleton Chapel in Memorial Church until 1955. And, of course, women were not allowed to study in Lamont Library; even Susan Sontag was excluded. This is the near past.
Going back a bit further, we recall that women's education began in what was called the "Annex" and, later, Radcliffe College, chartered in 1894 for women students, but with no faculty save the Harvard male faculty paid extra to teach women separately up the road. By 1970, there had been only five tenured women on the FAS faculty. After nearly a century, a merger of Harvard and Radcliffe began. In 1970, it was agreed there would be approximately 4 men admitted for every woman; then in 1972, 2.5 men for every woman, and finally in 1975 full parity.
Not until 1999 did they receive the same letter of admission and the same diploma.
Having assumed the previously unimaginable position of House Masters, now Faculty Deans, of Lowell House, we are next-door neighbors of two final clubs and a near neighbor two others. On weekends and other party evenings, I see the lines of young women standing outside the back gates of the clubs waiting to gain admission to these male bastions of parties and privilege. Who is on the list to get in? Are they dressed well enough, or scantily enough? Are they pretty enough? It's freezing outside. There's the gatekeeper with the clipboard and the list. The real estate is great, and it is thrilling to be admitted, crushing to be excluded. But I'm pretty sure the time will come when men and women alike will look back at how male clubs would regulate and monitor women’s entry and how they would let them into their paddocks through the back gate and say, “This is unimaginable.”
Harvard College has fundamentally changed during the past 50 years. It has changed with the deliberate and slow process of the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe. It has changed with the demographics of America as the sons and daughters of post-1965 immigration have come to college. It has changed as greater numbers of international students have enrolled. It has changed with ever-greater numbers of superb African American, Asian American and Latino students who qualify for admission. The Dining Hall at Lowell House is simply not the same place it was in 1960 or 1970. Students who live here today cannot imagine the all male and largely white world of the old Lowell, and do not yearn for it.
But despite all that has changed in the past decades, the final clubs have not fundamentally changed, even though they have attempted to be more racially and culturally inclusive. These clubs are the Throwback Thursdays of Harvard College, yet still holding the power and wealth to drive a significant part of the social scene.  Change is a challenge, and it is not mandatory. For a private club, it is a choice. But change is powered by imagination.
It is unclear to me what changes will be imagined as a result of the policies and principles articulated by President Drew Faust and Dean Rakesh Khurana. We could see it coming, though. Drew Faust said it nearly 15 years ago in addressing the incoming class of 2001, only the second class to be admitted in which women and men received the same letter of admission. Summarizing, as a historian, the long struggle at Harvard for the commitment to equality for all members of the community, she concluded, "I invoke the past today to remind you that such commitments are not deeply rooted in Harvard's history, and that they require a transformation, rather than an extension of tradition, and that such transformation requires work and attentiveness."
This is the imagination, the work, and the attentiveness that students today will surely undertake to create a club culture worthy of the vibrancy and diversity of the Harvard College student body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much has been made of observing the Twitter musings and rantings of our President-elect. But less thought has been given to the potential of using social media to prevent crime.
For privacy advocates and local officials, however, that debate is just beginning with the Boston Police Department’s recent decision to spend $1.4 million on software that will allow for large-scale social media monitoring.
Unfortunately, this initiative’s many problems make us strongly question the large sum of money that Boston Police Department will invest in it. For one, its efficacy is hamstrung by the fact that the technology can only look at information that is already publicly available, according to a statement to the Boston Globe from a police department spokesman.
Serious criminals are not plotting their crimes in public web forums. Many are using untraceable portions of the deep web. Others have simply set their Twitters to private. With the bar for thwarting the software so low, we are concerned that this large outlay will not yield a large dividend for the police department.
The Boston City Council is also concerned, and held a hearing Monday to discuss the issue. In the hearing, the Department did not name a vendor for the social media tracking software, missing a previously set December 5 deadline.
We hope that the Department missed the deadline because it is rethinking its decision to pursue the program in the first place. Beyond the fiscal concerns it raises, the idea of social media monitoring has also drawn the scrutiny of civil liberties groups like the American Civil Liberties Union. They rightly fear that such wide-reaching online surveillance will deter free speech, as people may not speak their minds as freely under the specter of surveillance. These consequences are not as minor as they may appear; in addition to representing an unnecessary government encroachment upon speech, the proposed program may unfairly target Bostonians living in certain neighborhoods. The ACLU also points to the difficulty of accurately deriving actionable information from large amounts of data.
Negative by themselves, these kinds of pseudo-intelligence programs are also part of the unfortunate trend of police militarization. If obtaining surplus equipment from the military has worsened the divide between police and communities, monitoring efforts will undoubtedly have a similar effect. Indeed, the ACLU has already shown that police departments in cities with troubled police-community relations like Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore have used social media to track social justice protests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 7, 2016, at 5:50 p.m.
A motion to oppose a College policy that penalizes members of final clubs and Greek organizations remains in limbo after a tense Faculty meeting Tuesday was adjourned without the expected vote. 
After former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 presented his motion, which states that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join,” the docket committee of the Faculty Council—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest elected body—recommended to postpone the motion indefinitely.
Before any vote on the motion—or its postponement—could take place, however, University President Drew G. Faust abruptly adjourned the meeting just after 5:30 p.m., the regular end time of meetings, per recommendation from the docket committee. She indicated the discussion of the motion was tabled until the next full meeting of the Faculty in February.
“I didn’t understand what just happened,” Lewis said immediately after the meeting adjourned.
In May, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced an unprecedented policy that, starting with the Class of 2021, bars members of finals clubs and Greek organizations from holding leadership positions in student organizations, becoming varsity captains, or receiving College endorsement for fellowships. After the announcement of the policy, Lewis and other 11 professors crafted the motion opposing it.
A vote on Lewis’s motion was on the agenda for Tuesday’s meeting, held in a Science Center lecture hall instead of the usual University Hall. Though Faculty votes are usually conducted by voice, professors eligible to vote were handed paper ballots as they entered the lecture hall.
At one point, however, it appeared there could be two possible votes at the meeting, after the docket committee introduced a motion to “postpone indefinitely” discussion of Lewis’s motion. Such a motion, according to Robert’s Rules of Order—the parliamentary procedure that governs Faculty meetings—would effectively kill the motion without an explicit ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote from the Faculty. Parimal G. Patil, a member of the docket committee and a professor of religion, said the motion would allow the Faculty to avoid the uncomfortable implications of a strict up or down vote.
“Neither a positive nor negative vote on the Lewis motion is in the interest of the FAS. A vote against the motion will appear as a vote in favor of discrimination,” Patil said. “A vote in support may also appear that way by implying that the Harvard faculty after much discussion, debate, and public spectacle voted against discrimination by voting to support those who discriminate.”
In advance of the meeting, the Faculty Council had declined to vote on Lewis’s motion, citing concerns over its wording. The motion does not explicitly mention the policy.
After Lewis and the docket committee presented their respective motions, several faculty members gave their own impassioned remarks about single gender social organizations and the College’s policy. English professor and member of a committee to implement the College’s policy Louis Menand gave an emphatic defense of the policy and its underlying logic.
“I am astonished that colleagues I like and respect have put their names to the motion before us. The motion is pure sophistry,” Menand said. “It basically says, ‘We cannot discriminate against people who discriminate because that would be a form of discrimination.’ Seriously? This is the kind of limits-of-tolerance hypothetical that you might be able to get away with in a freshman seminar, and it is unworthy of this Faculty.”
“Of course we can be intolerant of intolerance, and of course we can discriminate against people who discriminate,” Menand continued, raising his voice to applause.
When introducing his motion, Lewis argued that penalties levelled against members of single gender social organizations did constitute a form of discrimination on the part of the University.
“Of course such a punishment constitutes discrimination on the basis of club membership,” Lewis said, referring to the sanctions. “If Harvard refused to endorse black students for the Rhodes Scholarships, that would be racial discrimination. If Harvard refuses to endorse club members for Rhodes Scholarships, that will be discrimination on the basis of belonging to a club.”
Discussion at the packed meeting also raised issues of shared governance, with some professors sharply criticizing what they saw as parliamentary maneuvering and attempts to skirt Faculty input on the part of administrators. English professor James Engell, speaking neither in support of the motion nor the policy but rather in support of Faculty governance, sharply criticized administrators for forgoing Faculty input in crafting and unveiling the policy.
“What has happened since last spring, I believe, can be dangerous to the University and its Faculty. It is no understatement to say that it threatens a constitutional fabric,” Engell said. “This may not seem evident today, but in retrospect may be seen as a turning point in the governance of the University, and would not be seen as a good turning point.”
History professor James T. Kloppenberg, though, said in an interview after the meeting that to vote for Lewis’s motion and, in effect, against the sanctions, would be “an evasion of our responsibility as a Faculty.”
Two other Faculty members also defended the sanctions at the meeting. French Language and Literature and Comparative Literature professor Christie McDonald, who recently announced that she would resign as Mather House Faculty Dean in June 2017, thanked Faust and Khurana for taking steps to mitigate the “toxic atmosphere” of the clubs.
University Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. cited his positive experiences as a member of Book and Snake, a co-ed secret society at Yale, and excoriated the final clubs for remaining single-gender.
“Separate is not equal,” Gates said. “Given their long histories, and extensive networks among alumni, the final clubs have unique status and power on campus and in the broader Harvard world, and that status and power cannot be simulated by telling women they are free to create their own final clubs.”
Explaining the decision to adjourn the meeting, docket committee member David L. Howell cited a lengthy list of people who had not yet been given the opportunity to speak.
“Lots of faculty members have children that they have to pick up from daycare or other family responsibilities and we thought it was important to try to be as family friendly as possible,” Howell added.
Some professors, though, saw the decision to adjourn the meeting as a cynical attempt to curtail Lewis’s motion. In the past, Faculty have had the opportunity to vote to extend meetings in order to continue debate.
Mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid said he thought the decision to abruptly adjourn “was an attempt to stifle the discussion.”
University Professor Helen H. Vendler criticized the adjournment, as well as administrators’ lack of Faculty consultation in creating the policy.
“Doing diktats is not the way to govern. I mean, it’s a petty tyranny to not let us take the responsibility that is due us. I can’t believe any of this,” she said. “I don't know how they could do this in good conscience.”
Howell, who penned an op-ed last week on his decision to abstain from voting on Lewis’s motion, also expressed dissatisfaction at the delay caused by adjournment.
“I don’t think anyone’s happy to have this continue—the next meeting is February,” Howell said.
In an interview after the meeting, Faust said she was largely unsurprised by the points raised by the Faculty.
“I think I’ve heard most of the arguments in one form or another before, but there was a lot of energy and eloquence,” Faust said. “People obviously feel very passionate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 7, 2016, at 12:12 a.m.
University President Drew G. Faust said Harvard will not designate itself a “sanctuary campus” at a Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting held Tuesday afternoon in the Science Center.
Faust said she is worried calling Harvard a "sanctuary campus," a term she argued has no legal significance, could actually further endanger undocumented students at Harvard. She said she has met with members of Congress and other federal officials to discuss protections for undocumented students .
"It also risks drawing special attention to the students in ways that could put their status in greater jeopardy," Faust said. "I believe it would endanger, rather than protect, our students, and that is not something I am willing for this institution to do."
Faust spoke on the subject in response to questions history professor Walter Johnson raised during the meeting. He asked what steps the University will take to protect its undocumented students and other minority groups he said are threatened by President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed policies.
Johnson urged Faust to support labeling Harvard a sanctuary campus, citing the University’s global prominence and insisting the decision presented an opportunity for Harvard to demonstrate moral leadership.
“Given the importance of the word ‘sanctuary’ in the national discussion, the opportunity that Harvard has to take up moral leadership in that discussion, and the immense importance of the word to our students, [most] specifically to their sense that the University is willing to stand... by their side, why not use it,” Johnson said.
In her response, Faust noted initiatives the University has undertaken to support undocumented students in recent weeks, including hosting immigration experts and appointing Lars Madsen, Faust’s chief of staff, as a coordinator for advising efforts for undocumented students. Last month, Faust, in an email to Harvard affiliates, reiterated a message from Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. Riley indicating that the department will not ask about the immigration status of Harvard affiliates or enforce federal immigration laws.
At the meeting, Faust also discussed how the University would continue to lobby for federal research funding and a tax-exempt endowment under the Trump administration. She rejected the idea of sanctuary campus status, however, arguing that the name lacks a clear definition.
"Sanctuary campus status has no legal significance or even clear definition. It offers no actual protection to our students. I worry that in fact it offers false and misleading assurance," Faust said.
Faust’s statements came just minutes after students and faculty wrapped up a rally held in support of Johnson’s motion outside the building. Roughly 100 Harvard affiliates gathered in the Science Center Plaza to urge administrators to designate Harvard a sanctuary campus.
“I’m here to be a witness to your patriotism and to your love of this university,” Johnson said at the rally. “And I’m here to ask this nation and this university to fulfill the promise that you all represent.”
“Let America be America again,” he added, referencing both Trump’s famed campaign slogan and a poem by Langston Hughes that celebrates America’s immigrant history and diverse population.
Over the course of the hour-long rally, speakers from across campus—ranging from Harvard freshmen to tenured professors—discussed the pain and fear they said undocumented students have felt in the wake of the election.
Romance Languages and Literature associate professor Sergio Delgado said at the rally that designating Harvard a sanctuary campus would allow the University’s undocumented population to “thrive” again.
“When we as faculty and when we as administrators admit these students as our students, we make a fundamental commitment to support these students so that they can thrive,” Delgado said to cheers. “And whenever we fail at that commitment we’re not just failing those students, we’re failing this institution and we’re failing ourselves.”
Daishi Tanaka ’19, an undocumented student, echoed Delgado’s sentiments. He said his life on campus has “definitely” changed for the worse since Trump won the presidency, and that the idea of a sanctuary campus is “personally important” to him because it would grant him a “mental security” he now lacks.
As Delgado and others wrapped up their speeches and the assembled crowd chanted slogans like “No justice, no peace!”, Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors began to file into the Science Center ahead of the Faculty-wide meeting. Some stopped to listen, others hurried past.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana paused for a moment to watch the protesters before entering the building.
“We are committed to making an inclusive environment for our students,” he said. “We are looking forward to working with our students, and have been working with our students.”
As the rally neared its conclusion, Anastacia M. Valdespino ’18, one of the event’s organizers, grabbed the microphone and eyed the stream of professors entering the Science Center.
“I’ve seen multiple professors, some whom I’ve had, walking into the Science Center for their meeting,” she said. “We hope they know that Harvard needs to be a sanctuary campus.”
Faust’s decision not to name Harvard a sanctuary campus comes less than a month after Princeton University President Chris Eisgruber and Brown University President Christina Paxson both declined to adopt the label. The University of Pennsylvania remains the only Ivy League school to designate itself a sanctuary campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 8, 2016, at 3:52 p.m.
The Cambridge City Historical Commission did not reach a final decision last Thursday on whether to approve renovation plans for the historic Abbott Building in Harvard Square, after a previous iteration of developer Equity One’s plans was rejected by the Commission for being too disruptive to the surrounding neighborhood.
In the meeting, local lawyer James J. Rafferty,  Equity One Executive Vice President of Development William L. Brown and architect Mark Eclipse presented their plans for the building,  which currently houses the Curious George store, to a full audience. Local residents continued to raise concerns over the project after their presentation.
Equity One presented its original proposal at two meetings held last September and October, which included a large glass pavilion atop one of the buildings, but the commission recommended that it go back and re-work its design to include less glass.
The most prominent change made to the plans involved modifying the large glass pavilion that would sit on one of the buildings and extend over the Abbott building. The presenters said the company decided to modify this design after critical public comment.
“We recognize the challenges presented by this iconic location and we believe that having really listened and attempted to respond to the comments led the applicant to certain side decisions that are now presented this evening,” Rafferty said.
Other changes involved moving a mechanical well from on top of one of the buildings to make it less visible, lowering the roofline and removing the skylight, as well as pulling the stairs and the elevator away from the window of the proposed new building in order to preserve its initial designs.
Eclipse emphasized the blend of old and new that he believed the plans represented.
“We looked at some fairly recent buildings in [Harvard] Square to see what has been going on lately,” Eclipse said. He described the new plans as “both contextual and modern in terms of scale, material, the way the windows work.”
After the presentation, the floor opened to public comments, which were often critical of the redevelopment and even of real-estate developers themselves.
Cambridge resident Brad Bellows, along with several other audience members, indicated that the plans presented at the meeting did not seem to show the entire effect of the pavilion’s elevation.
“Isn’t the convention in showing elevations to show the whole elevation?” Bellows said. “The drawing should show the correct elevation.”
Local resident James Williamson also echoed the concern over the plans, expressing to the applicants a concern about whether they are “accurately delineating” their proposed changes.
Ultimately, the commission did not come to a final decision on the plans, instead recommending that the application make some modifications to their proposal. They resolved to address the matter once again at a future meeting.

CORRECTIONS: December 8, 2016, at 3:52 p.m.
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Cambridge City Historical Commission's hearing regarding the Abbott building's renovation plans was held on Friday, Dec. 2. In fact, it was held Thursday, Dec. 1. This article also misstated the name of resident and architect Brad Bellows as Brian Bellows. The article also misstated the name of Cambridge resident James Williamson as James Williams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With summer job and internship application deadlines approaching, many Harvard students are beginning the search for summer internships, research positions, and funding. An Office of Career Service fair Tuesday afternoon aimed to demystify the process and connect students with summer opportunities.

The fair, held at the SOCH, hosted over 50 different Harvard offices offering summer opportunities and funding for students.
Students said the breadth of information can pose difficulties for those unsure of what they want to do over summer break.
“I think you kind of have to come in with an idea and try to seek out information about that idea,” Catriona Barr ’20 said. “But if you don’t know where you’re starting it can be a little overwhelming.”
Timing presents another difficulty of applying for summer funding. Most funding application deadlines fall at the beginning of the spring semester, yet students may not have committed or received acceptance to  internships and programs at that point.
“It’s sort of a complicated process of trying to look for your internship or summer experience at the same time as potentially looking for ways to fund it,” said Deb Carroll, associate director of employer relations and operations at OCS. “It’s not simply [that] Harvard hands over funds, it’s an application process.”
According to Carroll, OCS primarily provides funding for international internships, jobs, and non-thesis research, although OCS also caters to requests for national funding. There are, however, several area studies institutes across the University that also provide funding for opportunities within their regions of interest.
“OCS is a large source of funding, but there’s actually many other sources of funding across Harvard as well as sources at internships,” Carroll said. “You know, there are departments or centers that are cultivating internships actually all around the U.S. and all around the world.”
The David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies offers funding for many students across the University. Last summer, DRCLAS provided 84 research and travel grants to students.
According to DRCLAS Program Manager Rachel Murray-Crawford, the center funds its structured programs, such as a summer internship program and study abroad opportunities in Latin American countries, as well as the DRCLAS Summer Travel Research Grant.
International funding is also available from the Harvard China Fund and the Center for European Studies. The Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships includes eight programs through which students can receive funding for pursuing academic research.
“We try to have as close as possible to have a one-stop shop for students to see all of their options,” said Carroll.
Simon Shen ’20 said the summer opportunities fair helped centralize and simplify information.
“It’s been helpful to actually see the faces of the people who are in charge of the programs,” he said. “It’s a much different experience than reading things online to get information, being able to ask questions.”
Carroll said she recommends students plan ahead of time and explore University resources for opportunities and funding.
“We say this all the time, but Harvard has so many resources, and that’s what makes it a challenge is how to navigate all of those different options,” said Carroll.

Harvard Square just got a little sweeter with the opening of pop-up chocolate shop Somerville on the Charles.
The chocolate store opened earlier this month in the storefront at 29 Church St., which is home to Lizzy’s Ice Cream shop. The pop-up shop is open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. through February.
Somerville on the Charles is the brainchild of Somerville chocolate shop owners Alexandra Whisnant, who owns Whisnant’s Gâté Comme des Filles, and Somerville Chocolate’s proprietor Eric Parkes.
Whisnant met the owner of Lizzy’s Ice Cream shop last year after purchasing a refrigerator on Craigslist that was owned by the store. As someone who grew up in Cambridge, Whisnant says she has always “dreamed” of having a shop in the Square.
“We felt that Harvard Square and chocolate went together,” Whisnant said. “Students need chocolate to study.”
Parkes also cited the holiday season as a big influence in the pair’s decision to set up shop.
Before opening its doors, Whisnant and Parkes redesigned the store by moving the front counter so people could walk around the back of the store, which is usually full of ice cream freezers. As a finishing touch, the duo added a mural of Harvard Square based on a map from the 1870s.
“I love it in there so much. I would stay there all day if I didn't need to make the chocolates back at the kitchen,” Whisnant said.
The chocolate store offers two basic chocolate options. One is the “bean-to-bar chocolate” that Somerville Chocolates specializes in, as well as hand dipped ganaches including truffles and bonbons courtesy of Gâté Comme des Filles.
According to Whisnant, her chocolates are made fresh everyday inside Aeronaut Brewery in Somerville and are meant to be eaten within the first week, describing the chocolates as more like a pastry or cake than a traditional chocolate. Parkes says his chocolate-making draws inspiration from around the world.
“I start with whole cacao from places around the world and take it all the way through to completion as craft chocolate bars,”  Parkes said.
The pop-up shop has also added chocolate mousse, brownies, and roasted cocoa nibs to their menu.
Harvard Square Business Association’s Executive Denise A. Jillson was “somewhat surprised” to learn of the chocolate shop’s arrival after happening upon an article online on the store’s opening.
“We are delighted that they are here and hope that they become a good community partner while in Harvard Square,”  Jillson said.
According to Jillson, the business association plans to visit the space and introduce themselves.
“We look forward to hopefully having them join our big chocolate festival in the middle of January,” Jillson said.
Emily Luu ’19 said she is excited to check out the new store.
“As a chocolate lover, I’m excited to go to somewhere else other than CVS to get my chocolate fix and treat myself,” Luu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The creation of a historic policy penalizing members of final clubs and Greek organizations without full Faculty consultation has prompted some professors to question administrators’ dedication to shared governance on major decisions about undergraduate social life.
During a contentious Faculty meeting Tuesday that adjourned without an expected vote on a motion against Harvard’s unprecedented social life policy, professors offered impassioned remarks about the lack of input members of the Faculty had in shaping the sanctions.
“The manner in which this policy was generated avoided coming to this Faculty,” English professor James Engell said. “It avoided discussion in the Faculty room. It avoided any Faculty vote. It avoided open voicing of Faculty dues consistent with past shared governance, especially regarding administration and discipline.”
In May, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the historic policy that, starting with the Class of 2021, prohibits members of the unrecognized single gender organizations from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, becoming varsity captains, or receiving College endorsement for fellowships. Administrators created the policy after a year of tense, behind-closed-doors meetings with leaders of single gender social organizations, primarily final clubs.
After the announcement of the policy, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and other 11 professors crafted the motion opposing it, writing that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
Faculty vote to approve changes to the student handbook, such as a new alcohol policy crafted in 2012 and the update of the College's gender neutral housing policy. As it stands now, the College’s policy on unrecognized single gender social organizations has not followed that procedure and is not included in the handbook.
During Tuesday’s meeting, which largely focused on the motion, Lewis said administrators’ announcement of the policy was an “alarm that went off.”
Although the full Faculty was slated to vote on Lewis’s motion Tuesday, discussion of the motion—and of the recommendation by the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest elected body, to postpone the motion indefinitely—has been tabled until the next full meeting of the Faculty in February.
Though some professors were critical of the policy itself, several other professors who spoke at the meeting affirmed their support for the College’s attempts to rectify a campus social climate they described as discriminatory and exclusionary.
In an interview last month, University President Drew G. Faust said administrators designed the policy to check the power that unrecognized single gender social organizations hold on campus. Faust also said she would “welcome the Faculty’s participation” in crafting a policy that best addresses the issues posed by single-gender clubs.
After Tuesday’s meeting adjourned, several professors echoed Engell’s critiques of administrative decisions, citing an absence of Faculty involvement in discussing and crafting sanctions.
University Professor Helen H. Vendler said she believed administrators have avoided addressing the role that the Faculty play in student discipline.
“I find the tactics of the administration loathsome, and I mean to have that word quoted,” Vendler said, adding that she had planned to present her views on their infringement of Faculty rights, including the responsibility to nominate fellowship candidates, had the meeting not been adjourned. “Never, in my 60 years of teaching, have I ever had the right to recommend a student taken away from me.”
In an interview after the meeting, mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid criticized the decision to postpone of the remaining discussion until the spring.
“Well, what can I say? I personally think that it was an attempt to stifle the discussion,” Schmid said. “It’s more faculty members being able to speak about the motion. That’s not going to be accomplished by keeping the meetings short.”
Docket committee member David L. Howell said at the meeting that “it was important” to postpone the discussion and accommodate faculty members with children or other family responsibilities.
History professor James T. Kloppenberg, who said he hoped to speak at the meeting, said he planned to vote to postpone Lewis’s motion indefinitely. He said Faculty members who want to voice their opinions on undergraduate social life should work with a committee charged with recommending how to implement the College’s policy.
That committee—comprised of undergraduates, 37 professors from across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Harvard administrators—was finalized earlier this fall.
“I do that because I care about, almost as passionately about, Faculty governance as Jim Engell does, but I think the thing for Faculty to do is to postpone this debate, and anyone who’s concerned should join the implementation committee,” Kloppenberg said, adding he thinks the Faculty generally share the opinion that the exclusionary clubs are detrimental to undergraduate social life.

Incoming Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 listed improving diversity, supporting the University’s capital campaign, and re-energizing faculty among his principal priorities when he takes charge of the school next month.
As of last week, Daley said in an interview with The Crimson that the school had raised just over $600 million—80 percent of the school’s capital campaign goal. The Medical School had the third highest goal out of Harvard’s individual schools: $750 million.
The new figure marks a roughly $70 million increase since last March, and Daley said the school is “slightly ahead of schedule.”
“I think we’re doing well, but I’m setting my sights on even higher goals in the future,” Daley said, adding that he plans to target the education and service fundraising categories moving forward.
Daley’s appointment came amid a year of activism around diversity and social justice issues at HMS. In February, before Daley’s appointment, the Racial Justice Coalition student group delivered a petition to Massachusetts Hall—where President Drew G. Faust’s office is located—demanding a dean who would address social justice issues.
In September, Daley attended an event at which over a hundred students crafted a “social justice agenda.”
“I continue to be very concerned about the relative lack of full diversity that we have, not just in our students but obviously in our faculty,” Daley said. “I think until our faculty and our student body reflect the diversity that we see in our patients whom we serve, we’re going to have more work to do.”
Daley said student activism around issues of social justice is “one of the things I’m most proud of about our medical students.”
“I’m not only expecting it, I’m celebrating it,” Daley said. “One of the defining features of our medical students is they come to medicine because it’s service-oriented, and that tends to select for a type of student who is in fact dedicated to helping others.”
“I expect them to be activists. I expect them to be holding me to a very high standard,” he added.
Daley said although the current University task force investigating issues of diversity includes Medical School faculty members, he plans to create a new diversity task force specifically for HMS.
“I think the University task force is going to do wonderful things across the entirety of our community, but we have unique issues that pertain to the Medical School,” Daley said. “When people of different colors come into a clinic, the data says that they get treated differently. And we need to understand that, and we need to remedy that.”
Daley added that he will also be taking a closer look at admissions.
“We’re finding that we’re losing some of our most outstanding underrepresented minorities because they’re being offered full scholarships at our peer institutions,” Daley said.
“We need to figure out a way to counterbalance that,” he added. “Think how amazing it would be if every student’s tuition was fully covered by some kind of endowment… but that’s a long term ambition.”
Among his other priorities, Daley said he wants to energize the faculty and continue innovating medical therapeutics. One method of energizing faculty will be to provide seed funding for new ideas, which Daley said he requested and “very generously” received from the University, but declined to disclose the exact sum.
Daley has spent the past few months “evolving” into his new role by engaging with HMS affiliates, from a visit last week to Mount Auburn Hospital, to talking to a security guard in Gordon Hall.
“This is a community where everybody has got to be working toward the greater vision of Harvard Medical School,” Daley said. “Whether they’re people who are running our IT program, serving our food in the cafeterias, or cleaning up the offices at night, I want people to feel part of this mission.”

UPDATED: December 7, 2016, at 12:10 a.m.
Freshman forward Seth Towns’s name may be splashed across the box score from Tuesday night’s 86-80 victory over Northeastern (4-5) for the Harvard men’s basketball team (3-4), but the win actually showed how dangerous Harvard’s depth can be.
Towns contributed a career-high 24 points in the contest, but when asked to describe his performance, he shifted the conversation to his teammate and captain, Siyani Chambers.
“Well honestly, it comes easy with the people that I’m playing with,” Towns said. “Especially with [Chambers] at point guard. He’s the best point guard I’ve ever played with.”
When the mic went to Chambers to respond, Chambers turned the attention away from himself and towards the rest of his teammates, nearly going through the whole roster of 20 names and pointing to the difference each player makes.
On Tuesday night, there were big individual performances. Towns’s career night. Sophomore guard Corey Johnson hit seven threes, a career-high, on just 10 attempts. Chambers and fellow senior Zena Edosomwan had double-doubles.
But there were also little performances that made an impact as the game remained close going into the waning minutes—blocks on a team that dominated the paint, ball-handling to help break a press, free throws to maintain a cushion down the stretch. Overall, 12 Harvard players saw the floor, which was equal to the number of heads on Northeastern’s entire roster.
“One to 20, everybody is important,” Chambers said. “It’s a team effort. It’s not one person, it’s not a couple people, it’s everybody, one to 20.”
The game put a young Harvard team in nearly every type of game situation, from being up by 20 to maintaining a two possession lead with under three minutes to go. Prior to Tuesday, the team had been on the opposite side of similar situations, but not yet on the positive side of both circumstances.
“We’re going through the ebbs and flows, and we did a lot of things today in order to win,” Chambers said. “We have to take this as a learning experience and try not to make those mistakes and not give up a 20-point lead where we believe we should have won a little more comfortably and not let it get all the way down. But on the other end of it, we’re really happy that we could pull it out.”
After going into the locker room with a 40-27 lead, Chambers was concerned with making sure his team came out in the second half with high energy. In past games, the team has struggled with complacency, allowing teams to get back in the game while Harvard relaxes rather than pushing the envelope.
The team did just that on Tuesday, eventually stretching the lead to 20. Up 59-41, freshman forward Chris Lewis laid a block on Northeastern’s Alex Murphy, while Miller corralled the rebound, brought the ball down the floor, and missed a layup. Lewis, however, was behind him to dunk the ball right back, bringing the crowd to its feet and forcing Huskies’ coach Bill Coen to call a timeout.
With seemingly all the momentum on its side, Harvard brought the ball back down the floor but struggled to find an open look. With the shot clock waning down, freshman guard Bryce Aiken drove to the hoop in traffic and lofted a layup as the buzzer rang. The shot fell, but the refs had to review the play to see if Aiken got it off in time. After several minutes of deliberation, the initial call of a made basket was reversed.
“I thought we were caught back on our heels in the second half even though we had close to a 20-point lead,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That play that we didn’t get the basket to count on Bryce really changed the whole momentum and dynamics of things.”
From there, Northeastern took the swing in momentum and went on a 12-0 run, with the Crimson going over four minutes without a made field goal. After the lead dropped to single digits, two free throws from Towns broke the ice for Harvard, then Johnson hit one of his seven threes on the next offensive possession.
Though the teams traded baskets for several minutes, the Huskies eventually pulled within four. At the under-four media timeout, Amaker pulled Edosomwan and put Miller in. Two possessions later, Miller hit his only shot of the game, a shot several feet behind the arc with a hand in his face that had the crowd and the Harvard bench on their feet. The trey put Harvard up 79-72 with 1:43 remaining and gave the team momentum it wouldn’t relinquish.
But the Crimson doesn’t have much time to celebrate. The team faces another local foe on Wednesday in Boston College.
At one point when Chambers was quiet in the press conference, he was asked what he was thinking about. Towns promptly responded, “tomorrow’s win.”

After leading the Harvard women’s soccer team through a championship-winning season, star senior Midge Purce recently garnered a pair of national accolades.
Last Tuesday, the National Soccer Coaches Association of America revealed its list of women’s semifinalists in consideration for the 2016 MAC Hermann Trophy, the most prestigious individual honor in collegiate soccer. Along with 14 of the best women’s soccer players across the nation this season, Purce made her way on to the list after an exceptional senior year.
A few days later, the NCSAA announced its 2016 Division I Women’s All-America Team—and once again, Purce’s name was on the list, this time on the All-America First Team. Purce is the first Harvard selection to the First Team since Emily Stauffer ’98-’99 and Naomi Miller ’99.
Both selections were made based on voting by NCAA Division I soccer coaches across the nation.
“To me, it means the work that I’ve done with my coaches in the past, and all the training days invested in me, and the time they’ve invested in me, you can actually see the results from them,” Purce said. “It’s just another way for me to verify that they have been so incredibly amazing. It’s another opportunity for me to say thank you.”
Purce also concludes her career leaving a host of marks on the record books. Her 42 career goals are seventh in Ivy League history. This year—a year in which the Ancient Eight was stacked with enough quality opposition to push defending 2015 champion Princeton down to fifth place—Purce paced the conference with 12 goals, four of which came in conference play. Her 28 total points also led the revamped Ivy League.
“She’s been a player that’s probably easy to notice in-game and in our oppositions’ scouting reports, for obvious reasons,” first-year head coach Chris Hamblin said. “Midge was a complete package this year. She’s defending very well from the front, she was able to beat people one-versus-one, she was able to get up near the crosses, she was able to create space—I think she was impossible really to contain.”
In addition to the two national awards, earlier this year, Purce was named the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year for the second time in her career, and unsurprisingly was named to the All-Ivy League First Team for the fourth straight season.
Hamblin, in his first year at the helm of the program, was also named Ivy League Coach of the Year after guiding the team to an unbeaten 5-0-2 Ivy League record. He noted that Purce’s success was also a product of her development as a player. Purce was named to the NCSAA All-America Third Team after her freshman season, and her senior accolades display her tremendous improvement over the years.
“She’s a very well-rounded player, which you could see with the success she had this year,” Hamblin said. “Midge wasn’t one dimension—she’s multi-dimensional in what she provided, and [she] had a phenomenal senior year. She’s been fun to watch grow as a person and as an impact player for the program.”
As Hamblin said, Purce wasn’t just a goal-scoring machine. Though it might’ve gone unnoticed in stat sheets, Purce defended well, created space, and opened up opportunities for her teammates by way of warranting constant attention from opposing teams.
Joining Purce on the All-Ivy First Team were teammates Carly Rotatori, a senior midfielder, and Dani Stollar, a junior defender.
Fellow senior forward Rachel Garcia also played an enormous role in pushing Harvard to the top of the Ivy table, with two clutch game-winning goals, one of which won the Crimson the Ivy title.
“Every member of our varsity contributed to our success year,” Hamblin said. “Midge would often draw some attention, and the rest of the front group were able to work in sync and play in combination together. It was a selfless approach from all the attacking players. Midge played a big role in that.”
Purce was especially selfless in describing her teammates this year.
“It was a very special group of girls that we had this year,” Purce said. “It’s easy to say that about every year, but this year it was really incredible the way our team came together and overcome a lot of hindrances on and off the field. It was a really special group, and I was honored to play with them and know them as teammates and friends.”
The banquet formally announcing the winner of the 2016 MAC Hermann Trophy will be held on January 6, 2017 at the Missouri Athletic Club in St. Louis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout the years, Alexander Kerfoot has regularly referred to himself as a “playmaker.” But never has his choice of vocabulary been more appropriate than now.
Remember that hypothesis predicting Harvard’s co-captain might see his production drop without the heroics of Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo? That’s now obsolete. Because Kerfoot looks to be on his way to the best season he’s ever had.
It was never Kerfoot who drew skeptics; it was his line. With Vesey and Criscuolo playing on opposite sides of him a season ago, Kerfoot had dished out a career-high 30 assists in 33 games—the sixth-best ratio in the nation. But there was cause to wonder whether a pair of sophomores, including one who had spent the bulk of his rookie campaign on the fourth line, would enable Kerfoot to produce at the same level.
Not anymore. That fourth-liner, Lewis Zerter-Gossage, has already doubled his goal total from a year ago. And the other second-year forward, Ryan Donato, has lived up to his high expectations, presenting the Crimson’s most dangerous scoring threat. The sophomore duo has combined for 13 goals in 11 games, and Kerfoot has assisted on more than half of them.
“We got off to a little bit of a slow start, but that’s expected when you’re playing with new guys,” Kerfoot said. “I think that as the games have gone on, we’ve figured it out as a line. I’m playing with two really good players again this year, so that’s always nice.”
Factor in the impact Kerfoot has had on the Crimson power play, and it becomes clear why the center from West Vancouver has been as valuable as ever. Kerfoot has grabbed a point on 40 percent of conversions by the Harvard power play, whose 31 percent success rate ranks first in the country.
Two of those points were earned Friday night in the first leg of what proved to be an outstanding road trip for both Kerfoot and the Crimson. Up against No. 19 St. Lawrence, the first-place team in the ECAC, the co-captain not only earned two points on the power play; he had a hand in all four Harvard scores. His two goals and two assists propelled the Crimson to a 4-2 road win.
The four-point showing would have been just the second of his career, that is, if he hadn’t achieved the same impressive feat just six days prior. The center logged a career-best four assists in a 5-2 home victory against Bentley over Thanksgiving break.
But Kerfoot wasn’t done. One night after his outburst against St. Lawrence, the co-captain earned another two helpers in a 7-3 win at Clarkson—solidifying his hold on The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week designation.
“It’s no secret to the coaching staff and the guys in that locker room that Alexander Kerfoot’s a hell of a player,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 after the win at St. Lawrence. “He plays in every situation, [and] he can really distribute the puck…. He’s certainly been there for us every night.”
Once again, Kerfoot’s name ranks right atop the list of college hockey’s top distributors. His 1.27 assists per game represent the second best rate in the country. Only Adam Fox, the freshman defenseman who works with Kerfoot on Harvard’s top-ranked power play unit, ranks higher.
But perhaps the most impressive element about Kerfoot’s game this year has been something he promised at the season’s outset that he would make a concerted effort to work on—getting his own shot.
Last year, Kerfoot scored four goals in 33 games, and he ranked ninth on the team in shots on goal. This fall, the co-captain has lit the lamp five times in just a third of the time. He also ranks fourth in shots on net.
“It’s a little bit easy to pass when you’re playing with Ryan and Lewis this year, who’ve got great shots and are really good goal-scorers,” Kerfoot said. “But I think just to improve my game in general, I want to be a little bit more aggressive.”
So far, it’s working; Kerfoot has even said it himself. In the slot this weekend, his rocket of a wrister flew by the league’s top goaltender. At No. 7 Boston University, his quick trigger on a breakaway lit the lamp. And working down low against No. 3 Boston College, his quick hands were what set off the siren.
The “playmaker” is making more plays than he ever has before. And Harvard looks all the more dangerous because of it.

This past June, Channing Tatum signed up to take Professor Anita Elberse’s HBS executive education course and came to campus to the immense delight of Harvard fans. Later this week, however, we'll have "anotha" one—that is, another esteemed celeb coming to campus.
DJ Khaled is scheduled to speak at “The Business of Entertainment, Media, and Sports,” where he will have a conversation with him moderated by Professor Elberse this Friday, December 9, from 4:30 to 5:30 in Aldrich 112. Following the conversation Khaled will be signing books in Aldrich 111 from 5:30 to 6:30.
Yes, it’s reading period, and yes, everyone has papers to finish and exams to study for. But, if you’re hesitant to take even a short break to witness a legend on campus, just remember that even though they don’t want you to take a break, they don’t want you to have fun, and they don’t want you to hear the wise words of DJ Khaled, you really, really should.
Maybe this will be the major key to reading period you've been looking for all along. Happy studies, #blessup.

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that DJ Khaled was enrolled in the course The Business of Entertainment, Media, and Sports.” In fact, he only spoke during the course event.
