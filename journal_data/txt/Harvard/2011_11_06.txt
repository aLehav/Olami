After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School Professor Emeritus Susumu Ito was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation’s most prestigious award that can be given to a civilian, last Wednesday for his service in World War II along with thousands of Japanese-American veterans.
“The thought of receiving this medal after so many years ... was somewhat of a surprise for me,” said Ito, 87.
Speaker of the House John A. Boehner presented the medal to members of the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and the Military Intelligence Service, units that were composed mostly of Japanese-Americans.
Coming so many years later, the awards were another marker of conciliation between the U.S. government and Japanese-Americans who faced injustices, including mass interments, during the Second World War.
Ito said that he “never felt much discrimination at all,” but expressed gratitude that he and his fellow veterans have finally received recognition.
“I feel very good ... that [our service] is finally being acknowledged as a significant contribution to the war effort,” Ito said.
Ito is now world-renowned for his research on the gastrointestinal tract, but his beginnings were unassuming as a son of a sharecropper in rural California.
After graduating from high school, Ito first went to junior college, but transferred to auto-mechanic school before being drafted into the military in 1940 immediately before Pearl Harbor. Assigned to the 442nd Regiment, Ito started out as a motor sergeant.
He then volunteered for the perilous position of forward observer, excited to get into the thick of the action.
“It was more like being in the war,” Ito recalled. “They told me it was the most dangerous position you can have, and the expectancy of being a casualty was amongst the highest.”
After his military service, Ito went on to earn a Ph.D. in biology, using the G.I. Bill to fund his education.
Colleagues said that Ito has been equally adventurous in his academic career.
“He would try things that other people would think was crazy,” said Morris J. Karnovsky, a fellow HMS professor emeritus.
Karnovsky recalled that when Ito needed a sample for his research, he “biopsied his own stomach” by forcing a tube down his throat.
Fellow scientists also emphasized Ito’s humility.
“He’s a completely unpretentious, but very accomplished person, who [goes] out of his way to be helpful to everyone around him,” said Thomas D. Pollard, who graduated from HMS in 1968 and is now a cell biology professor at Yale. Pollard worked in Ito’s lab as a medical student.
Ito said that the award symbolizes the recognition of his own service and his fellow soldiers.
“I take [the award] with pride and primarily for those that were killed in the war and the many that have passed on since then,” Ito said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and entrepreneurs headed to the Harvard Business School this weekend for “Cyberposium: 17, Sky’s the Limit?,” packing into rooms of Aldrich Hall to hear from industry leaders about the state of the booming tech industry.
The Business School’s TechMedia Club organized the seventeenth annual tech conference, the largest in the world held at a business school. This year, panelists focused on the industry’s prosperity and the field’s increasingly quantitative bend.
When discussing the industry’s growth trajectory, speakers emphasized that the technology field has undergone “a revolution, not an evolution.”
“There was no such thing as an ‘App Store’ four years ago,” Jim Cox of Microsoft said during the “Mobile Gaming” panel.
“Mobile Gaming” panelists included top dogs in the industry such as Chris Gibbs, EA Mobile executive producers, and Justin Cinicolo, a general manager at Zynga, which has designed prominent Facebook games such as FarmVille.
Gibbs, Cinicolo, and others discussed how mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet computers, have pushed companies to cater to the general public, an audience to which the gaming industry was once unaccustomed.
“The word ‘gamer’ is now defunct,” Cox said. “It used to be the group of hard-core guys taking head shots in Halo. Now the gamer is all of us.”
But, while the mobile games industry is becoming bigger and more profitable, the mobile platform does have some limitations, panelists said.
This platform limits designers in game complexity. In addition, mobile gaming also tends to be less social, putting the industry at a cross current with the growing tide of social media, as Harlan Crystal, CTO and co-founder of game developer Pocket Gems, pointed out.
Later in the day, “eBooks: From Print to Digital,” focused on how the publishing industry has made the transition to digital print.
The questions posed by the moderator and the students in attendance drove the conversation predominantly toward electronic textbooks and their role in the student book market.
“Spending $500 every semester on text books that you only read a few chapters of, I do not like it,” said one student in attendance, who raised her hand and stood up to make this remark in the middle of the panel.
Nathan Schultz, vice-president at Chegg, a digital book distributor, emphasized the need for publishers to adapt to the demands of students as they begin to push for more specialized content that may only be book excerpts instead of entire tomes.
Many panelists agreed on the vast potential for digital print to maximize the reading experience beyond words on a page.
Peter Coffee, vice-president and head of platform research at marketing company salesforce.com, said that though the popularity of the digital books has increased, the books would be even more successful if digital publishers moved away from models established by print publishers.
“At some point, you have to re-think instead of merely refining, and that’s what I hope will happen to the idea of what we used to call a ‘book,’” Coffee said.
“When I highlight a Kindle book, I can go to my Kindle account on the Web and I can review all of those highlights —or search them—or expand the context around any one of them—or make them public,” Coffee added in an email. “This is a lot more than merely changing the medium of expression; it creates new and valuable forms of expression, or rather it hugely lowers the cost of those forms—to the point that many more people will use them.”
While the prevalence of technology underlaid many of the classroom discussions, those in attendance illustrated the trend well, as students and entrepreneurs texted, tweeted, and browsed the Internet on pocket devices throughout the day.

Wish there was a better way to find out about parties and events going on at Harvard? Want something more concrete than hearing "Oh yeah, there's something going on in Quad"? Tired of the crushing loneliness that comes with a night in? Yasha S. Iravantchi '13 and Ryan A. Neff '13 have heard your cries for help, and they have the solution: a subreddit specifically about Harvard events, called HarvardTonight.
For those not in the know, or just for people that actually pay attention in class, Reddit is a social news website, comprised entirely of user-generated content. It is essentially a platform for users all over the internet to submit content, which can be anything from world news to silly pictures of cats. The Reddit community can then either "upvote" or "downvote" the content, with "upvotes" counting as positive votes and "downvotes" counting as negative votes. The most popular content is then pushed to the front page.
A "subreddit" is a specific sub-community on Reddit with its own page on Reddit to share content that is related to a specific topic. "HarvardTonight" was created by Iravantchi and Neff to serve as an aggregator for events at Harvard that. "We wanted to make a quick tool where people could post and find out about parties. You don't need a student group or organization to post about an event; it's very organic. You can just go on the site and tell people about a party in your room," Iravantchi said.
Iravantchi and Neff hope that the HarvardTonight subreddit will address with some of the problems other event calendars suffer from. "On other event pages, the events aren't sorted in a useful manner. This subreddit makes it a lot easier to see which events are the most popular," Neff said. The "upvote" system provides a simple sorting system for events based on user interest. The Reddit platform also allows for open discussion in the comments section of each event, something most other calendars do not offer.
So, the next time you're wondering what's going on at Harvard tonight, check out HarvardTonight.
