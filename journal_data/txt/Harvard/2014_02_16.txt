After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may have been Valentine’s Day, but the Harvard women’s basketball team did not show Columbia any love on Friday night.
The Crimson (16-5, 6-1 Ivy) opened up a four-game homestand at Lavietes Pavilion against the Lions (4-17, 1-6) and shot the lights out in the first half en route to a 99-64 win.
Two weeks ago, Harvard held a 14-point lead at Princeton and watched it dwindle to just one in late in the game. Against Columbia, the Crimson again jumped out to a sizeable lead before the break.  But this time, Harvard managed to maintain its defensive pressure throughout, forcing Columbia into a hole that proved too much for the visitors to climb out of.
The final score represented the team’s largest margin of victory this season and kept the squad atop the Ancient Eight, a half game ahead of Penn.
“We talk the talk all the time, but I thought we walked the walk a little bit better tonight,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It’s hard—sometimes you relax a little bit. We were scoring pretty easily—until the end, at least. I have to give [the Lions] credit; they didn’t stop playing. It’s hard to play that hard when you’re getting killed.”
The contest was Harvard’s first at home since its Jan. 25 matchup against Dartmouth, and the familiarity of Lavietes showed in the team’s play, according to Delaney-Smith. The Crimson shot 68 percent from the floor in the first half, including 70 percent from behind the arc, and 58.2 percent overall.
“I think we were happy to be home,” Delaney-Smith said. “We love to play here, and we’ve had the tougher [part] of the Ivy League schedule, so I know I’m thrilled to be home.”
Despite trailing by double digits throughout the majority of the night, the Lions refused to check out from the game. Midway through the second half, guard Sara Mead and forward Tori Oliver hit back-to-back treys to finish a 12-1 run that brought Columbia within 26.
But that was as close to a comeback as the Lions would be able to manage. Led by seven points within four minutes from sophomore forward AnnMarie Healy, the Crimson saw its lead surge to 42, its largest of the night. Healy finished with 17 points, second only behind co-captain Christine Clark’s 21. The sophomore also pulled down 10 rebounds for her first career double-double.
It was a banner night for others on the team, too, as the large lead allowed the bench to see some action—all but one player who suited up for the game contributed to the scoreboard for Harvard. Junior co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins tied her career-high with three points, and two freshmen—guard Grace Keane and forward Maggie Hartman—also received playing time.
Hartman, who had been sidelined for much of the year due to injury, made her collegiate debut against Columbia, hitting 7-of-8 from the charity stripe and finishing with nine points.
“We kind of live for that, I think,” Clark said. “We’re such a close-knit team, and it just makes everyone feel so good to see Dink out there, to see Maggie out there. You just live for these kinds of things.”
Six minutes elapsed in the game before the Lions managed to get on the scoreboard, and the double-digit lead that the Crimson built in the opening minutes never disappeared.
Seconds after Columbia hit its first bucket, junior guard Ali Curtis also sunk her first shot—a three-pointer. From there, sophomore guard Kit Metoyer joined the party, pouring in three treys on consecutive possessions. Mullins added in her own three-pointer to extend the lead to 15 halfway through the first period.
“Kit is our secret weapon,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a young guard who just needed to finish up some defensive skills, and she finally has. We’ve always known that she’s an incredible shooter…. I think she’ll be someone to be reckoned with.”
Behind a stifling 2-3 zone defense that held Columbia to 25.8 percent shooting and just two points in the paint before halftime, Harvard built a 26-point lead heading into the break.
The Crimson capitalized on the Lions’ foul trouble as well—Harvard took 40 attempts from the line, where Columbia tried just 16 foul shots.
“I think what we’ve been trying to accomplish is to be a better defensive team,” Delaney-Smith said. “They had 22 in the first half and we were trying to hold them to that in the second. I was pretty happy with our defense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the regular season winding down and postseason play looming on the horizon, the Harvard men’s hockey team (9-12-4, 5-9-4 ECAC) seems to have finally found its groove.
Traveling to New York for the weekend, the Crimson picked up three crucial points, defeating Clarkson (17-13-2, 10-8-0), 1-0, and tying St. Lawrence (11-15-4, 5-9-4), 2-2.
“I think the weekend went well,” freshman defenseman Victor Newell said. “The team is starting to get on a roll now at the right time. These points are big for the team.”
HARVARD 2, ST. LAWRENCE 2
With less than 80 seconds to play against St. Lawrence, Harvard looked poised to complete the weekend road sweep and gain momentum heading into the playoffs. But a power play goal by Saint forward Matt Carey—set up by brother Greg Carey—with 1:19 remaining in the contest knotted up the game and ended the Crimson’s hopes of extending its winning streak to four.
Harvard held the lead for the entire third period before the younger Carey’s equalizer. With less than a minute left in the second frame, sophomore forward Brian Hart broke a 1-1 tie with his fourth goal of the season, propelling the Crimson to a 2-1 advantage.
Newell opened the game’s scoring with a 5-on-3 power play goal with 8:08 remaining in the second period. Sophomore Jimmy Vesey continued his hot streak, contributing an assist on the opening score to extend his point total to a team-high 22.
St. Lawrence fought blow-for-blow with the Crimson, responding to each of Harvard’s scores. Less than seven minutes after Newell’s goal on the man advantage, Greg Carey took advantage of a holding penalty against the Crimson, managing to sneak the puck past sophomore goaltender Steve Michalek to knot the game at one apiece.
Despite giving up two goals, Michalek stopped 41 Saint shots on the night.
“He was huge,” McNally said. “We wouldn’t have won on Friday and tied on Saturday without him.”
HARVARD 1, CLARKSON 0 (OT)
Sixty minutes was not enough to separate Harvard and No. 21 Clarkson on Friday evening, as both goaltenders held clean sheets at the end of regulation.
But with 14 seconds remaining in overtime, Vesey finally put the scoreboard to use, netting the game-winner on a two-on-one break to give Harvard its third consecutive victory, 1-0.
Hart started the attack when he gained possession of the puck at his own blue line. He quickly fired a pass up the ice to freshman forward Sean Malone, who created the two-on-one advantage.
After drawing in the Golden Knight defenseman, Malone sent a pass to Vesey from the top of the right circle. The Crimson’s leading scorer then beat Clarkson goaltender Steve Perry stick-side, sending the Harvard bench into a frenzy.
“If you give [the puck] to a kid like Jimmy, he’s going to score that goal every time,” McNally said. “It’s nice to get an overtime win, which we really haven’t had this year.”
Prior to the goal, the Golden Knights had stifled the Harvard offense for most of the night, holding the team to just 17 shots. But Clarkson could not get any of its 31 attempts past Michalek. The goalkeeper had also stopped 31 Golden Knight shots in the teams’ first matchup earlier this season.
Michalek enabled Harvard to force overtime with a clutch performance in the final minutes of regulation. With 4:47 left in the third period, senior defenseman Danny Fick was whistled for making contact with an opponent’s head and issued a game misconduct, negating a Crimson power play and giving Clarkson a man advantage for the final 2:47 of the frame. But four saves from the Crimson goaltender led to the fifth successful kill of the night for the nation’s third-best penalty-killing unit.
Harvard’s three-game winning streak was its first such regular season run since the team won its last three contests in 2011. The victory also marks the Crimson’s fifth consecutive defeat of the Golden Knights at Cheel Arena.
Following the successful weekend, the squad looks to continue its hot streak and prepare for the upcoming postseason.
“We need to start getting points and moving up in the standings so that we can get home ice for the first round of the playoffs,” McNally said. “So every game we have to come out and get one or hopefully two points.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night, it took about 49 minutes of game time for the Harvard men’s basketball team (20-4, 7-1 Ivy) to seal its victory over Columbia (15-10, 4-4). On Saturday night at Cornell (2-20, 1-7) it took 17 minutes to lock away an eventual 67-44 victory.
With 3:08 remaining in the first half, a quick score by senior forward Kyle Casey gave the Crimson a double-digit lead that it would not relinquish. While it took over two and a half hours for the final buzzer to ring on Friday, the contest in Ithaca spanned only an hour and change.
And, while Friday night’s matchup came down to free throws, a clutch three-pointer, and a referee’s whistle, the outcome of Saturday’s game was settled before 9 p.m.
“[We] made sure we were going up to Ithaca without any thoughts of us being fatigued or tired,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It wasn’t going to be a thought in our minds. We made sure we talked to them this week [about how] it is natural for them to feel mental fatigue, as well…. We thought they wrapped their heads around it well.”
On a night where mental strength was key, the Crimson turned to co-captain Brandyn Curry to lead the way. The veteran made his first jump shot of the night less than five minutes into the contest and didn’t look back. He finished the game with a team-high 14 points, notching five assists—one more than the entire Cornell team combined.
Harvard broke away late in the first half, going on a 14-6 run to take command of the gaame. The spurt was started by none other than Curry.
After the Big Red’s Jake Matthews missed a shot from deep, Casey grabbed the board and threw the outlet pass to junior wing Wesley Saunders, who pushed the ball ahead to sophomore Agunwa Okolie. Okolie gave the rock right back to Saunders, who sent it to Curry in the right corner. Curry wasted no time, knocking down the three to extend Harvard’s lead to eight.
One Cornell free throw later, Curry ran a give-and-go with sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers, with Curry finishing the play on a two-dribble floater from the right baseline. Curry was up to nine points—Cornell was at 10.
“Brandyn is stepping forward for us and he is doing things that a senior guard must do,” Amaker said. “There is a confidence factor that he brings. He is playing an all around game where he is making shots, he is driving, [and] he is also defending. Brandyn is being Brandyn.”
And so it continued. Despite a 6-0 run from Cornell to cut the lead to 10, 28-18, back-to-back layups from Casey and Saunders, followed by consecutive three-pointers from co-captain Laurent Rivard and Chambers, gave the Crimson a 14-point lead heading into intermission.
Just as it only took a few minutes for the Crimson to jump out to a dominant lead in the first half, so it only took 1:12 of the second period for Harvard to carry out its trademark alley-oop, putting the game away with almost an entire half to play.
Following a Rivard rebound, Chambers took the ball on the left wing, waiting for a cut from Casey. On cue, Casey beat his man backdoor, streaked to the basket, and converted the pass to a decisive slam in the basket to give the Crimson its biggest lead of the night at 18. The dunk was the 94th of Casey’s collegiate career.
The Big Red would not come much closer the rest of the way, despite a solid stat line from guard Nolan Cressler. The sophomore had 17 points, sinking three pointers at a 71.4 clip on the night. Overall, however, he shot only 6-of-13 from the field.
“I thought we played really well defensively,” Amaker said. “You can see that with the numbers and we had good balance…. [Cressler] is a good player, he makes difficult shots and gets threes in transition. Those are the players we have to lock into.”
In addition to solid shooting efforts from its starters, Okolie had an efficient performance off the Crimson bench. At the 10:32 mark of the second period, the sophomore grabbed a loose ball on the right side of the paint. With the shot clock running down, Okolie put up a rainbow fade-away jumper, which swished into the basket with just one second in the possession left to spare.
Three minutes later, a mistake by Big Red center David Onuorah led to a Harvard fast break. Curry passed the ball ahead to Rivard, and the rock proceeded to swing from Rivard to Saunders, back to Curry, and then to junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi, who lobbed the ball across the paint to Okolie. Okolie caught the ball, gathered himself, and stuffed it home.
Overall, Okolie went 3-of-3 from the floor, one of five Crimson players to shoot at least 50 percent on the night, two of whom were off the bench.
“We thought coming into this weekend that we needed to go back to what made us good [in previous weekends]…and that was playing different bodies and different guys, and using our bench and our balance,” Amaker said. “We need [our bench] guys to play for us…[We need them to be] healthy and contributing off the bench for us. They did very well tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard wrestling team outpaced Brown from the very beginning this past Saturday afternoon, seizing control from the outset and holding on to claim the victory.  The Crimson (4-6, 3-6 EIWA) outlasted the Bears (3-8, 1-7) on the road for the second consecutive year, notching the win with a final score of 30-10. 
“Our start made a huge difference for us today,” sophomore Devon Gobbo said. “[Sophomore Jeff Ott] came out really strong at 133, and right after that [sophomore Todd Preston] had a really big technical fall.  They got the ball rolling for us, and the energy on our bench kept that mentality going the whole match.”
Following last week’s disappointment at the hands of Princeton and Penn, Harvard was focused on capturing its first Ivy League win of the season.
“It was a really great win for us, coming off two hard losses last weekend to teams that we felt we could’ve beaten,” Preston said. “It felt really good to be able to turn things around in our favor today.”
After an forfeit in the first matchup, the Crimson expanded its 6-0 lead to 9-0, with Ott registering a decision over Brown’s Anthony Finocchiaro. Preston matched this energy in the following round, outmaneuvering his opponent at the 141-pound weight class. These three straight victories gave Harvard a commanding 14 point lead, while the Bears remained scoreless.
“Today, we were the better team,” Preston said. “We had more energy on our side coming from the bench and our fans, and you could really see that in the way we wrestled.”
The Crimson’s hot start marked one of the best openings that Harvard has put up against an opponent all season, as the Crimson swept the opening three matches for the first time this year.
“We wanted to be the aggressive team in this match, and I think we really were,” Gobbo said.
Brown saw a slight shift in momentum in its favor towards the end of the day. Starting at the 174-pound weight class, Ricky McDonald kicked off a two round rally for the Bears.  McDonald had a decision over Harvard senior Ian Roy, and his teammate Ophir Bernstein followed up with a decision of his own over senior Cameron Croy at 184.
That scoring spree was the last the Bears saw of the scoreboard for the rest of the competition. The Crimson’s heavyweights managed to close out the day with the same intensity seen in the first few rounds, keeping Harvard in control at the end of the contest.
“As a team everyone wrestled really well, from top to bottom,” Gobbo said. “We all wrestled aggressively all seven minutes of every match, and no one took any time off.”
Sophomore Nick Gajdzik repeated last week’s standout performance in the final matchup of the day against Brown’s Ryder Cavey.  It took Gajdzik just a minute and 47 seconds to find his stride, as he managed to pin Cavey and register the fall for the Crimson.
Fellow heavyweight James Fox also contributed to the Crimson’s efforts. The junior kept his winning streak alive, beating Brown’s Augustus Marker, 12-3, at the 197-pound position.  This victory marked Fox’s sixth straight dual meet win for the Crimson this season.
Other crucial performances for the Crimson came from Gobbo and freshman Tyler Grimaldi, who each registered a decision over his opponent at the midway mark of the contest.
“Brown’s guys were getting tired at the end of the match,” Gobbo said. “And we were able to capitalize on that…. We scored a lot of points in the third period today. Being more aggressive and wrestling hard the whole time helped a lot.”
With this win in the books, the Crimson is looking forward to its upcoming matches in the coming weeks.
“As a team, we are just looking to take this one game at a time,” Preston said. “Right now, we want to be thinking about beating Lehigh, and beating Columbia after them.  Those are two teams that we were able to beat last year, so I really think we have it in us to take home the wins again.”
These two dual meets will mark the end of the team season for Harvard, and the squad looks to finish with the same mindset that it started the year with.
“We have two tough teams next weekend, but I think we’re wrestling really well as a team right now, and things are coming together for us,” Gobbo said. “We just have to keep the energy and positivity coming from the bench, stay aggressive, and wrestle tough.”
