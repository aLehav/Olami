After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"I brought my son to campus once, and it was clear he was not welcome," said a friend. "Why? Did they tell you he wasn't allowed in the department?" she was asked. "No," she replied, "but it was clear in my interactions that there was something unnatural about it. Why do I want to expose him to that toxicity?" 
As parents and graduate workers at Harvard, we knew we would face challenges balancing work and family. But challenges like this always turn out to be much more difficult than predicted. Now that we have spent some time here at Harvard, we see clearly that the lack of a robust set of family-friendly policies for graduate student employees often forces individuals to choose between an academic career and starting or continuing a family. To make matters worse, research has repeatedly shown that these challenges disproportionately impact women, and hamper the academic careers of mothers. These unnecessary barriers undermine accessibility to and completion of Harvard’s graduate programs and, in the process, weaken Harvard’s ability to be a leader in supporting academic families
This is one among many reasons for forming a union of graduate employees. We hope to address these types of barriers to the academic workforce by bargaining for access to childcare subsidies, a semester of paid family leave, and more affordable dependent healthcare coverage, all of which would make Harvard a more inclusive and family-friendly institution.
Let’s start with healthcare. Healthcare costs have risen at unsustainable rates. Healthcare for a dependent child through the Harvard plan costs roughly $2,868 per year, in addition to $3,432 for the primary subscriber, and $2,768 for the facilities fee (the latter two past the fourth year of study). These fees can add up to over three months of the 12-month compensation for many Harvard graduate employees, before even considering other family-related expenses, like childcare.
Childcare costs make this equation worse, since Massachusetts has higher costs than any other state in the country, especially for infants. Graduate students are ineligible for state-run childcare aid, and while Harvard employees (including lecturers, post-docs, etc.) can apply for childcare subsidies from the university, graduate students cannot. Even if we could win one of the few spots in Harvard’s childcare centers, full-time infant daycare costs for the lowest income range would be $2,232 per month, nearly the entire monthly salary of a typical graduate employee.  That’s if the daycare has a spot—many have wait lists.
Moreover, parental leave policies are not yet uniform across the Harvard schools, with some schools only now developing an official parental leave policy, and others with no leave policy at all. Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences currently offers grads either six weeks of paid leave or a check of six weeks pay at a two-section teaching load if they do not take leave after the birth of a child. Students only receive this check if they continue working and take no leave around childbirth, or if they are on stipend or fellowship during the semester their child is born. This is a significant improvement over nothing, but it is not on par with our peer institutions, like Princeton, which offer graduate student birth mothers and primary caregivers a full additional semester of stipend-level funding following the birth of a child.
We do not want to give the impression that Harvard graduate student parents are worse off than other parents, or that it is impossible to have children in graduate school, or impossible to do so without support from a high-earning partner. Many of us take on these challenges every day. However, we firmly believe that Harvard can do better.
We believe that with a recognized union and collective bargaining, we could make the kinds of improvements—as unions have done at New York University and more than 60 public universities across the United States—Harvard would be more accessible to graduate students of all genders with families.
Legally and ethically, a commitment to gender equality necessitates the equal access of parents and non-parents to graduate education. A union could help bring Harvard's resources for graduate student parents in line with those at our peer institutions, and in line with Harvard's own resources for other employee parents. It could also help foster a more humane and supportive atmosphere in the academy as a whole.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A certain cognitive dissonance defines my temporary stint in Seoul as a child. Seoul was a place where the sheer number of tall apartment buildings made their own concrete mountains, while a taller green serenity hummed in the background from every angle. Mountains cover 75 percent of the peninsula, though the detached image of the outdoors runs in stark contrast to South Korea’s general eagerness to succeed within the global system. Even as a child, I felt a stress to achieve in the fluorescent streets of Seoul, a mental cacophony that was assuaged by chong, the quintessentially Korean expression for human-to-human affinity.
Every Sunday, the family debate dealt with the pros and cons of using the remainder of the precious weekend to go out and hike. And when we did, boy was it an ordeal. In many ways, outdoor activity in Korea eagerly subscribed to the forces of capitalism. The hustle and bustle of the outside was allowed to seep in. Technical gear—moisture-wicking apparel, hiking poles, and sun protection, to name a few things—was a requirement, not a luxury, for hikes that lasted at most five hours and were half an hour away from home. Food and beverages—and portable gas stoves for especially ambitious trips—were divided evenly among the family’s small daypacks. We depleted the stock by eating or sharing everything before we’re even halfway there.
And so, hiking was Korean to me before it was White.
Hence my surprise when I came back to the United States at eight and gradually realized that hiking here seems to be grasped by a Thoreau-ian solitude and the desire to escape worldly forces. This is not to deny that the woods, to a certain degree, perform the same irresistible magic on everyone everywhere through creating spaces of self-reflection and genuine connections. But I also cannot deny that I initially felt uncomfortable and fake in my flannel shirts, a style that traces its way back to the white pastoral scene of Welsh farms and owes its popularity to L.L. Bean-esque lumberjacks. Eventually, the calls of assimilation and “fitting in” were just as alluring as the reflective serenity of the woods. Soon, what had been a quintessentially Korean family activity turned into an anxious self-reassurance of Americanization.
I dedicate the bulk of my last column this semester  to this lengthy reflection because it shows how little control we have over our identities, self-identities, and the factors that shape both of these things. We do indeed exercise choice in designing our lives; after all, we dress a certain way, associate with certain social circles, and take certain opinions because we make decisions to do so. However, we also owe thought to deconstructing the larger social context in which we make these choices and decisions. What are the social pressures and hierarchy of cultures that led me to let hiking serve as leverage for expressing my whitewashed American identity rather than a proud vestige of my Korean identity? How much agency do we really, ultimately have in shaping the person that we convince ourselves we are at the end of each day?
If I have been taught one thing at Harvard, it is that we must think critically about our surroundings. But questioning the world in relation to ourselves often comes in direct conflict with our urge to succeed, the external metrics of which are so tied to the world as it unfairly and unjustly remains. The world can sometimes seem to spin around you at a suppressing momentum, but we train ourselves to be okay with that in order to survive. Harvard Yard can sometimes be a suffocating place for the identities upon which its prestige was not built, but it’s also a place that people of precisely those identities are compelled to embrace in order to move forward in the world.
Contradictions on contradictions. That is the weight of this place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 13, 2015, 12:37 a.m.
Following a debate over the summer and fall, Massachusetts has abandoned the Common Core State Standards and instead will develop its own evaluations. The new evaluations will nonetheless be based partly on the Common Core, and Massachusetts Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education Mitchell D. Chester—who was a lead developer of Common Core—will have significant influence in drawing up them up. As Harvard students, we should care about standardized tests as a means of ensuring quality and equality in education, yielding more diverse college classes and better lives for students. In scrapping the Common Core, Massachusetts compromises this goal, turning back on its legacy as a pioneer in public education.
The Common Core is a set of education standards developed primarily by educators to establish basic benchmarks of what students in given grades should be learning. The Obama administration encouraged states to adopt the Common Core by tying it to Race to the Top funding. When Massachusetts first committed to the standards in 2010, the standards enjoyed bipartisan support in the Bay State—education reform advocates and the national affiliates of both major teachers unions initially lauded their adoption.
Since then, Common Core and testing in general have become fraught in Massachusetts and in other states. Conservatives argue that education should be local and that the standards overstep the federal government’s bounds; teachers unions have claimed that standardized testing leads to unfair judgments regarding school and teacher quality. Some critics say that the standards focus too much on critical thinking; others have seized on false reports of “common core worksheets” encouraging liberal values.
These concerns are misguided and troubling. At the heart of the Common Core—and of standardized testing in general—is the conviction that students should be assured a quality education regardless of zip code or income level. In practice, this maxim requires measurement of a given school’s success in teaching its students, even if it is possible for school districts with abundant resources to do well without testing. Without standards of some kind, we run the risk of graduating students from public high schools without giving them the education they deserve.
The state and federal governments have clear reason to work toward this goal, and anti-standard arguments based on federal overreach forget that the Common Core is encouraged with carrots, not sticks—the federal government is allowed to dole out its funds as it pleases. Moreover, these goals of improving American public schools are central to the mission of this University as well.
The Bay State knows well the value of thoughtfully implemented standardized tests. Since its 1993 adoption of MCAS—its first standardized test system—Massachusetts has become known as the national leader in public education. Standardized test data has been used to improve funding structure, fine-tune curriculum, and identify districts that need greater support and state involvement. And while it is true that raw test scores should not be the sole measure of a teacher’s performance, that has not been the case in Massachusetts. Testing has not been perfect, but its overall impact is positive.
Massachusetts has not decided to abandon testing or standards entirely, yet the rhetoric around the decision is nonetheless troubling. Molly Jackson in the Christian Science Monitor speculated that the decision “may hasten the end of a high-stakes national testing era.” If that is the case, the state will be worse off: The Common Core is a good policy that furthers Massachusetts’ long-held goal of equal education. The state’s decision to scrap its implementation is a grave disappointment.
This editorial has been changed to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: Dec. 13
This editorial has been updated to clarify the nature of Massachusetts' decision to scrap use of the Common Core-aligned PARCC exam. The state will not develop its own new standards, but rather its own new test, which will be a hybrid of the state's current MCAS test and the Common Core-aligned PARCC test.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s lunchtime at Annenberg, and a mass exodus of Economics 10 students streaming out of Sanders Theatre has swarmed the doors to the freshman dining hall. The line stretches beyond the doors to the sidewalk outside. Despite the grumbles from the back of the line, freshmen cheer up by the time they enter the dining hall and a friendly, boisterous voice greets them.
“Hey David. Hey Shankar. Hey Josh. Hey Daniel,” says John S. Martin, an ID checker in Annenberg.
The string of students respond with the same phrase, “Thanks, John!”
Students have handed their IDs to Martin for six years. He jokes with them, playfully swiping their ID cards and engaging in small talk. Martin, or simply “John” to the hundreds of freshman he sees everyday, has become somewhat of a celebrity for students at Harvard. He said the most important part of his job is connecting with students and making freshmen feel comfortable during their first year at the College.
A DAY IN THE LIFE
Martin usually spends his day in Annenberg swiping students in, as well as performing other tasks which include occasionally chasing tourists out. But the part of the job he likes most is interacting with the hundreds of freshmen that eat in Annenberg everyday.
“My favorite part about the job actually is getting to know students,” he said. “That’s most exciting for me.”

Above all, Martin says his goal is to make students feel comfortable in the dining hall through personal efforts such as memorizing students’ names. Davis Lazowski ’19 said he appreciated Martin’s efforts.
“I feel like all of the swiping staff, as a group, are some of the warmest people on campus, and John is especially so,” he said. “It’s amazing how he memorizes my name when there are [hundreds] of freshmen.”
Martin also said that he uses ID card tricks to entertain students.
“It’s something different to make everybody laugh and to make people feel comfortable,” he said. “You guys are coming from exams and stuff.”
The atmosphere in Annenberg that Martin creates has earned him praise from students and co-workers alike.
“He makes the students feel special and takes away the monotony of lining up for food everyday,” said Marina Wang ’19.
Laura N. Sanchez, a fellow ID checker in Annenberg, said Martin is a supportive colleague.
“He is a very nice guy and an easy-going person. It is very easy to work with him,” she said. “He was my trainer, when I became a checker, and he was very kind.”
While Martin does enjoy the community in Annenberg, he laments the short amount of time he has with freshmen each year.
“The only thing I don’t like is that we are only getting you guys for first year,” he said. “I mean it’s great because we get a new group in every year, but it would be better if we could see you guys for more than one year.”
Yet Martin also said he keeps up with many upperclassmen who come to Annenberg to eat breakfast.
During quieter periods of the day, Martin familiarizes himself with the history of Annenberg and Memorial Hall.
“I think we take it for granted when we are in here,” he said, while marveling at the busts on the walls. Martin also takes time to read the explanatory plaques below each statue. “Sometimes I’ll venture off and read a little bit of this or a little bit of that. I’ve been doing that more recently to try to get familiar with the building.”
FROM FENWAY PARK TO HARVARD YARD
Before arriving at Harvard, Martin worked around the Greater Boston area at some of the most famous sites in the city, including the home of the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park.
For nearly his entire life, Martin lived in nearby Somerville.
“Growing up in Somerville, Harvard was here,” he said. “Me and my friends would always travel here. We’d go to The Garage and buy some hacky sacks.”
Martin started working at the concessions stand in Fenway Park while studying at Bay State College, located in Boston’s Back Bay.
“It was like my second year, and I was working at Fenway Park while I was going to school and [working at] Star Market,” he said. Star Market is a grocery store chain based in the Greater Boston area.
When Martin was working at Fenway Park, the Red Sox had not won a World Series championship in decades. While other employees went home after the stand closed at the end of seventh inning, Martin, an avid Red Sox fan, stayed behind.
“The best part was after the seventh inning they would let us watch the rest of game,” he said. Martin would often go to the stands to watch the game.
“I would always sneak up,” he said as he laughed. Martin said he was thankful to have seen some important moments in Red Sox history, including Derek Lowe’s no-hitter in 2002.
After a few semesters of working part-time at Fenway while enrolled at Bay State, Martin began to look for full-time employment.
“I couldn't come up with the money for the next semester,” he said. “And I was like, ‘Alright I’ll just take a semester off, and I’ll go back.’ But I ended up applying for a job [at Harvard], and I never went back to school. I just started working full time.”
Martin first worked at Leverett House. “I was a pot washer for twenty hours a week, and gradually I kept applying for in-house jobs,” he said.
However, in 2009, Martin was reassigned to Annenberg after all Harvard University Dining Services workers had to rebid for their positions because of staff downsizing.
Martin says he has found a home at Annenberg since moving there. When asked whether he prefered Leverett House or Annenberg, Martin emphatically said, “Oh, Annenberg!”
LIFE OUTSIDE OF THE BERG
While Martin spends well over forty hours each week at Annenberg, outside Cambridge, Martin enjoys sports and spending time with his family.
“I love sports,” he said. “And I’m watching as much as I can .” Martin remains loyal to his Boston roots, cheering on the Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics, and Bruins.
Above all, Martin shows a deep commitment to his young family. He has a five-year-old daughter and a son who will turn three years old on Thursday.
“I love spending quality time with my family,” he said.
Martin’s daughter is a Girl Scout, and he takes his whole family on many of her scouting expeditions. “It’s great. A lot of the activities she has, we get to do them with her, and the whole family can enjoy it,” he said.
His family recently left his hometown of Somerville for Tewksbury, a town about 45 minutes away from campus. Because of the longer commute, when he works the breakfast shift, Martin is unable to see his children in the morning, which has been a difficult change for him.
Looking to the future, while moving has presented challenges, Martin said he would like to continue working in Annenberg because he has found a community among his co-workers and students.
“My kids are going to school where we live, so if I was to change [jobs] it would probably be because of that,” he said. “I feel comfortable here. I really enjoy working here, and I think I’ll stay.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After making a series of demands they say will improve Harvard Law School’s treatment of minority students, more than 100 students gathered on the campus’s Kumble Plaza on Monday to protest what they said was Law School Dean Martha L. Minow’s failure to adequately address their concerns.
Law School students presented a series of demands—ranging from changing the Law School’s controversial seal, which has ties to slavery, to establishing a critical race theory program at the school—at a meeting of hundreds of Law School affiliates on Friday, asking that Minow respond to them by 9 a.m. on Monday. Students said they had not heard from Minow by the deadline and decided to gather in protest.
Law students have become increasingly critical of the school’s treatment of minority students in recent weeks, after a controversy in November involving pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of black professors. The incident, which police are investigating as a hate crime, intensified broader discussions about racism at the school, prompting administrators to call a series of community meetings about race.
At these meetings, Minow has outlined proposals that she said address some student concerns and will improve the experience of minority students and staff at the Law School. Still, some students are unsatisfied, and after their demands on the Law School’s administration were not immediately met, some Law School students are taking to campus spaces and the internet to advocate for their goals.
According to Shay N. Johnson, one of the students who spoke at Monday’s rally, student representatives went to Minow’s office around 9 a.m. on Monday. They were met by the school’s dean of administration, Francis X. McCrossan, who informed them that Minow was in Chicago on business, Johnson said.
The students, Johnson said, left Minow a letter, containing another copy of their demands and informing her that “we will be following up,” and signed “Best, Reclaim Harvard Law.” By 10 a.m., they had finalized plans for the rally on Kumble Plaza.
After speeches from several students and staff in support of the demands, Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells, took to the megaphone to address the crowd, many of whom carried signs.
Calling Friday’s meeting “amazing and uplifting,” as well as “challenging,” Sells confirmed that Minow was in Chicago on previously scheduled business and that the administration was carefully considering a response.
“It’s important for us to really think through a response and to also make sure that we’re including the community,” said Sells, whose recent appointment was praised by members of Law student affinity groups. “A quick response to those issues would give them not the value...they deserve.”
Still, students reiterated the urgency of their demands and the need for a quick response on Monday.
“One thing we’ve been getting a lot is that we haven’t given the administration enough time,” said Rena T. Karefa-Johnson, a third-year Law student who spoke after Sells. “Students have been asking for these things for decades... We’re not going to stop.”
According to the president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, Leland S. Shelton, student activists had begun to formulate a response ahead of monday Morning in case Minow failed to respond to their demands by the deadline they set.
“I don’t think any students realistically expected her to in 48 hours give a really deep detailed response to those demands,” Shelton said. The aim of the demands, according to Shelton, was “forcing her to say something.”
In an email Monday afternoon, Minow wrote to all Law School affiliates, reiterating her commitment to “building a truly diverse community.”
“Some students and staff have presented a list of demands,” Minow wrote. “We are, however, a community of many voices and hopes, and we have an obligation to provide and protect the opportunity for all to participate, speak and be heard.”
On Tuesday, students from Reclaim Harvard Law School—a coalition of affinity groups at the school—sat and studied together in Wasserstein Hall. According to student Alexander J. Clayborne, they were there to discuss their demands.
“We’re going to make it clear to the administration and to the Law School community that we’re not going away until we force Harvard Law School to achieve the promise that it gave us when we got here,” Clayborne said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 10, 2015, at 11:55 p.m.
A group of Harvard workers from across several of the University’s unions announced the formation of a “coalition” of students and workers at a rally last week in light of Harvard University Dining Services workers’ contract renegotiations, set for the spring.
Students and workers aimed for the event to “make everyone on campus aware” of potential issues involved in the upcoming negotiations, like health care, said Noah R. Wagner ’18, a member of Student Labor Action Movement who participated in the rally.
Campus Services Vice President Meredith L. Weenick ’90 said in an emailed statement that, with negotiations set to commence in seven months, the University is prepared to “negotiate in good faith” with Local 26, the union that represents HUDS workers.
Students from across a variety of organizations including the Student Labor Action Movement, the Harvard Islamic Society, and the Palestine Solidarity Committee gathered inside the Phillips Brooks House last week to hear testimonials from HUDS workers, who expressed concerns over possible changes to health care, citing cost sharing as a major motivation for the speak-out. The students and workers then marched across the Yard to Massachusetts Hall.
Some Harvard security guards, who are organized under the Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards Union, as well as members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, were also present at the event, Wagner said, adding that organizers hope future rallies will include members of Harvard’s faculty, as well.
“We need to understand that it’s not just workers who are fighting for their own interests and students who are standing with them,” Wagner said, emphasizing the impact that changes to workers’ contracts can have on all members of the Harvard community.
“We have a lot of natural allies out there,” Adams House dining staff member and speak-out organizer Edward B. Childs said at the rally.
“We’re going to make this an issue,” he added. “That’s what we want to do with the students...help form this coalition that will not only build everything on campus but get the word out.”
Brian Lang, president of Local 26, said that potential changes to the union’s health care plans, which featured heavily among the comments at last week’s event, will be a “focal point” of the upcoming negotiations, adding that his goal is to prevent changes to health care plans that would result in cost shifting towards workers.
Lang’s concerns come in the wake of months of contentious health care debates at Harvard. In fall 2014, the University proposed a restructuring of health care benefits for non-union employees amidst backlash, and later added other benefits plan options. Health care is also a point of contention in the ongoing contract renegotiation between the University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, now more than two months past their deadline.
Lang said that he anticipates “a very difficult set of negotiations” if the union’s concerns about cost shifting are not addressed.
According to Weenick, the University will continue to work with the union to “achieve an agreement that ensures fair and competitive wages, health care and other benefits, while also supporting the University’s primary mission.”
Students and workers hope to host more joint demonstrations in the coming months as the negotiations approach, Wagner said.
“This is definitely a group that plans to demonstrate our shared interests and desires to see worker health and public health protected,” Wagner added. “This is just the very beginning of the effort to make everyone on campus aware of their connections to this issue.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: December 10, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard withdrew its originally proposed health care benefits plan amidst employee backlash. In fact, Harvard kept the plan and later created additional benefits plans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a four-hour open house hosted by the Office of Career Services in mid-November, freshmen steadily streamed into the quaint building at 54 Dunster St. and milled from station to station, toting bags full of flyers and candy. More than half a year in advance, these students were beginning to plan how they will spend their first summer in college.
At Harvard, students said they feel pressured to find summer experiences that make for substantive learning and professional opportunities.
“That’s always the question everyone asks after [summer] break,” Emily T. M. Trang ’16 said as a panelist for a First Generation Student Union summer opportunities event held last week. “They ask, ‘How’s your summer?’ But they really mean, ‘What did you do?’” Trang spent her freshman summer in Boston working for Fidelity Investments.
Laura A. DeFeo ’16,  a student adviser at the Office of International Education who traveled to Tanzania to educate locals about HIV prevention during her freshman summer, echoed Trang’s sentiment.
“For Harvard kids, we panic a lot,” DeFeo said. “‘I need to be in a lab! I need to be having an internship or something that’s going to look good on a resume!’”
As the newest members of the College who have not yet declared a concentration, freshmen face a limited pool of employers willing to consider them for paid summer internships, said Robin Mount, OCS director of career, research, and international opportunities.
“There aren’t a lot of paid positions for freshmen unless you can code or design apps,” Mount said. “Most of the skills that freshmen have aren’t ones employers are ready to pay for yet.”
As a result, for some freshmen, the upcoming three-month vacation provides an opportunity to cultivate new interests, serve their communities, conduct research, and travel rather than land a prestigious internship. Still, others view the break from academic responsibilities as a chance to build resumes and network. Yet, earning income and making summer affordable can be a limiting factor in choosing summer experiences.
CREEPING DEADLINES
OCS created Summer Planning for Freshmen, or SPF, events at the request of the Freshman Dean’s Office after reports that students missed application deadlines that largely fall early in the spring semester, Mount said.
“If you don’t think about [summer] until you get back in spring semester and deadlines are a week away, you don’t have time to ask for letters of recommendation and to put the pieces together that makes you competitive enough to get those opportunities,” Mount said.
Freshmen said this application timeline departs from their experiences planning their summers in high school and provides an additional challenge for students still transitioning to College life.
“On the sheet, it said that there are already deadlines that I missed or advisory things that I missed in September and October,” said Tynan Jackson ’19, an attendee at SPF-19, which was held in mid-November. “We’re thinking about if we’re going to survive college, not what we’re going to do during the summer.”
According to Mount, the academic calendar can complicate timely summer planning.
“You guys leave late December, and you don’t come back until almost the end of January,” she said. “So the deadline is quick once you get back on campus. You have to get started a little earlier.”
Gwen Thomas ’17 described herself as “totally lost” while trying to plan her freshman summer, beginning her search in March of that year. She ended up teaching through the CIVICS program at the Institute Of Politics.
“Everyone had it figured out,” she said. “It didn’t occur to me that people did stuff over the summer as freshmen.”
Similarly, DeFeo said she felt overwhelmed by the scramble to make summer plans after winter break.
“Everyone comes back from winter break and is kind of like, ‘Oh! We need to figure out our summers.’ And it’s Harvard, so everyone is really intense about it,” she said. “And I’m just this kid from New Jersey, like, ‘Oh god, what am I doing?’”
A TIME TO EXPLORE
With a vast array of options, from public service to research and study abroad, as well as a perception that future internships leading to full-time employment focus less on freshman summer experiences, freshmen said they aimed to invest in personal interests.
“Most employers say that what students did in their freshman summer typically isn’t the factor that got them the interview and the job,” said Deborah Carroll, OCS associate director of employer relations and operations.
With this in mind, many freshmen and upperclassmen described the summer after freshman year as a time of relaxation and exploration. Some freshmen pointed to academic research as an interest to be developed over the vacation.
According to Jeffrey Berg, an assistant director in the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships, the 2015 cohort of PRISE fellows, students who conducted research as part of the Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering, included 39 freshmen or 32 percent of the total group.
For other residential programs like the Behavioral Laboratory in the Social Sciences, the Program for Research in Markets and Organizations, the Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program, and the Summer Undergraduate Research in Global Health, freshmen represented 20 percent overall, ranging from 6 percent to 30 percent across the programs, he wrote in an email.
However, many freshmen say that they are still unsure of what opportunity they hope to pursue this summer.
“I really wanted to take the summer off and re-evaluate my year, see what exactly I was interested in and not jump into something thinking that I would like it,” Yong Dich ’19 said.
For her part, Anna M. Raheem ’19 said utilizing the time to explore can then lead to discovery of what students want to do in the future.
“Having fun and exploring can actually be very important in figuring out what you want to do,” Raheem said. “If you never try anything out, how will you know if you like it or not?”
Ashri Anurudran ’19 observed that many of her peers are looking for opportunities outside of the office.
“I’ve been talking to a lot of freshmen, and most of them say that they want to do something unique and not the typical internship in New York where you’re stuck in a cubicle all day,” she said.
Denise J. Kwong ’19, who said she hopes to spend her summer completing an internship abroad, said she wanted a non-classroom experience due to the her otherwise academic focus during the school year.
“I kind of want something that’s more hands-on, just kind of getting [my hands] dirty in the field,” she said. “I would prefer a more immersive experience rather than a classroom experience.”
Christi S. Balaki ’18, who conducted lab research at in Florida during her freshman summer, said she had the understanding that freshman summer “doesn’t matter” for future prospects.
“Junior year you’re like, ‘I need an internship!’ But your freshman summer is more like, ‘Let me relax, let me explore before I have to go out and get an internship junior year,’” Balaki said.
Freshman proctor Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 said that he tells freshman students to look for summer experiences that provide a chance to destress and venture into different fields.
“I encourage students to think smaller. The odds that you get an internship with Goldman after freshman year are slim, but that isn’t what I think you should be doing with your freshmen summer to begin with,” Gilfillian said. “There’s nothing wrong with just going home.”
While a plethora of freshmen plan to spend the summer cultivating personal interests, others still seek opportunities for career development.
“Some people want internships because they are trained to want to do it, because it’s a prestigious thing,” said Avika Dua ’17.
For others, getting a summer internship simply serves as a source of motivation for professional goals.
“To be honest, I definitely see it as a resume builder,” Jackson said.
LOOKING FOR PAY
Although Harvard hosts a database of funding and opportunities for undergraduates, which features sources of funding from OCS, the IOP, the Global Health Institute, and the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, among numerous offices, many freshmen said receiving pay or acquiring funding remained a primary concern for their summer plans.
“Harvard has a lot of opportunities and a lot of resources, but at least for me, as a first-gen student, I didn’t know how to access them,”  said Vanessa Decembre ’16, speaking of her freshman year experience at the summer opportunities event hosted by the First Generation Student Union.
At the event, panelist Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, who studied in Peru during her freshman summer, said she felt torn between finding a paid opportunity and returning home.
“The tension for me was choosing to do an internship that made money but also feeling pressure from my family to return home and spend time with them,” she said.
Not all students can receive funding. OCS can support only 50 percent of the students who apply for OCS funding for Harvard Summer Study Abroad programs, and money is allocated through a lottery system. Among those, about one-third of students funded are freshman, with fewer juniors funded and no seniors funded, Mount said.
Harvard also provides funding for independent, student-initiated summer research through the Harvard College Research Program, which requires applicants to arrange their own research projects with Harvard-affiliated faculty. Freshmen represented about eight percent of those who received funding in the summer of 2015, Berg said.
Out of the about 100 students who received Director’s Internships through the IOP, 27 were freshmen, 39 sophomores, and the rest juniors or off-cycle seniors. Director’s Interns receive $4,000 as a stipend for their summer internships.
This means that although freshmen typically rely on Harvard funding as the only source of income during unpaid summer opportunities, they constitute only a fraction of those who receive the funding. For some, the question of affordability remains.
“I had the responsibility of giving back to my family in some aspect and that made me want to find some job that did have some amount of money,” Ted J. White ’17 said of his freshman summer, when he worked at the Crimson Summer Academy, a program he had been a part of during high school.
White, a coordinator for the Harvard College First Generation Student Union, said that summer housing expenses continue to be an issue.
“One of the barriers, at least for me, is finding internships where I can get enough for housing,” White said. “Internships concentrate in places like D.C., New York, even Boston itself. It’s hard to find housing that’s affordable on a stipend for eight to 12 weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University has released the results of its inaugural Impact Study, a survey commissioned to quantify the global activity of Harvard alumni in entrepreneurship, board service, and volunteer service. The study shows that nearly four out of 10 alumni are founders of for-profit or nonprofit organizations, and that alumni serve on almost 300,000 boards.
The survey was sent to the 244,835 living alumni who continue to receive emails from the University and had a response rate of approximately 15 percent and a completion rate of 10 percent. Respondents with LinkedIn accounts could use their profiles to automatically answer some survey questions. The University commissioned Market Strategies International, a market research firm, to work with Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner to develop the survey.
Lerner said planning for the study began about a year and a half ago. Organizers spent a year developing the survey before its release, and respondents could complete it between May and July.
“[Business School Dean Nitin Nohria] asked me if I would be involved in this effort around a year and a half ago, and I said, ‘Yes, I think it’s a great idea to do this, but I am only going to be enthusiastic if we can do this as carefully and accurately as we can,’” Lerner said. “We tried to work out a variety of methodologies to address the fact that we don’t have a universe of people answering.”
The study was released in the midst of the University-wide $6.5 billion capital campaign, which launched its public phase in 2013. The University has already raised more than $6 billion in gifts and pledges.
Lerner said that he was interested in shifting the perception that all Harvard graduates  go on to work at large corporations.
“In a way, because we’re not seen traditionally as a tech school—we’re not seen as an MIT or a Stanford—the entrepreneurial story of Harvard graduates has been underplayed and underappreciated,” Lerner said. “In bringing some data to compare...we can change the perceptions of the school a bit more broadly.
The study emphasized the global reach of alumni entrepreneurship in the for-profit and nonprofit sectors. Nearly one-third of the 146,429 active ventures founded by Harvard alumni have their headquarters outside of the United States. While respondents tended to found more for-profit organizations in Oceania and South America, they founded more nonprofit ventures in Africa and Asia. The median age for entrepreneurship among Harvard alumni is 40, with 32 percent of ventures founded before the founder was 35.
According to the study, 66 percent of graduates have served on a board. The top sectors for board service include professional, technical, and scientific services; finance and insurance; and schools, universities, and libraries. Alumni are more likely to serve on nonprofit boards than for-profit boards, according to the survey—72 percent of boards served were for nonprofit organizations.
The survey also tracked volunteerism at all ages for Harvard alumni. Graduates between the ages of 25 and 34 were least likely to participate in volunteer work, with 40 percent reporting participation. Volunteerism tends to increase with age among alumni, peaking with the graduates between 65 and 74, with 57 percent reporting participation in volunteer service.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University’s flagship faculty body, will vote whether to affirm its commitment to student body diversity after being presented with a report which argued for the importance of racial and ethnic diversity to the College’s mission.
The report, which was discussed at the final FAS meeting of the semester this past week, comes as the College’s admissions policies face legal scrutiny, including the filing of a lawsuit last year accusing the College of discriminating against Asian-American students through its affirmative action policies.
“We emphatically embrace and reaffirm the University’s long-held view that student body diversity—including racial diversity—is essential to our pedagogical objectives and institutional mission,” the report said.
The report was drafted by a small faculty committee convened last January which was chaired by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. The report outlines the development of religious, ethnic, and racial diversity at Harvard. It includes a brief history of the University’s participation in several high-profile affirmative action cases heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, along with various amici curiae briefs filed with the Court vigorously defending race-based affirmative action.
The report will be discussed Wednesday at a meeting of the Faculty Council, the highest elected body in FAS, according to committee member and Human and Evolutionary Biology professor David Pilbeam.
After the Faculty Council review, faculty members are slated to vote on endorsing the report as a “statement of values embraced by the Faculty” at their first meeting of the spring semester.
Harvard has remained active in the legal debate over affirmative action. Most recently, the University defended its race-based admissions policies in a brief filed in the affirmative action case Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin. The Court will begin hearing oral arguments in the case on Wednesday.
In its 27-page brief, the University argued that a diverse student body represents “a compelling interest that justifies race-conscious admissions in higher education.”
This past July, a judge granted the University’s request for a postponement of its own lawsuit pending the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Fisher case.
The committee’s report touched on similar arguments for student body diversity as the University’s Fisher brief, including that it aids the development of undergraduates in classroom, research, and residential life.
It also cites survey data collected from graduating seniors that “confirm that the benefits resulting from our diverse student body are both real and profound,” including that about two-thirds of graduating students report their ability to relate to those different from themselves increased during their time at the College.
The debate over Harvard’s admissions policies comes as students and administrators participate in a much larger discussion over racial and ethnic diversity at the College.
In November, a College working group released its own report on diversity, and recommended several changes including the creation of University-wide task force to study the topic. While both committees operated independently, Pusey Minister Jonathan L. Walton chaired the College working group and served on the FAS committee.
Khurana wrote in an email that even as the groups worked independently, both reports “are timely and helpful to our ongoing work to create a more inclusive and belonging community” at the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—John Papale was at it again.
Two years after the senior hit two late-game threes to help his Terriers overcome a 10-point second half deficit and force overtime against the Harvard men’s basketball team, the scene was repeating itself again.
Down 14 midway through the second half, BU (3-5) had narrowed the deficit to six with just under three minutes to go. After a three from Harvard junior Corbin Miller had pushed the lead to nine, Papale—having missed his first seven field goals—shook free and shot a three without hesitation. Splash.
Two possessions later, after Harvard committed a shot clock violation, backcourt mate Cheddi Mosely found Papale unguarded in the corner—“a mental breakdown,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker later said. Splash. Three-point game.
Coming out of the timeout, freshman guard Corey Johnson was focused on making up for his mistake. Amaker asks his guards to fake help off shooters, and Johnson had gone too far, giving Papale just enough air space.
“I looked at Coach [Amaker], and he looked at me, and I kind of a gave a look [saying] ‘I know what I did,’” Johnson said. “I said to myself, ‘I’ll make up for it right now.’”
Out of the timeout, freshman Tommy McCarthy drove right, only to see Johnson’s man hedge hard on him. Without hesitation, the point guard whipped the ball to his classmate, who let the shot fly as he faded out of bounds. The ball splashed through the basket, redemption and relief in one.
Thirty-two seconds later, the Crimson (3-6) had its first road win of the season, 75-69.
“[The win] is critical for us,” Amaker said. “Given where we have been and the tough games and tough losses that we have had…the game was going to be a pivotal moment for our ball-club.”
The loss broke the Crimson’s second three-game losing streak ahead of the team’s longest break of the season, a two-week hiatus for exams ahead of its trip to Hawaii for the Diamond Head Classic during the Christmas break. After battling No. 4/7 Kansas down to the wire in its last outing, Johnson said the team had talked about how good it could be.
“Everybody says we are young but we know from that game that we are really capable of a lot so it is just really realizing that,” Johnson said. “When we play together, play our defense, take away shots, and listen to coach [Amaker]…. It just speaks for itself.”
Harvard carried that momentum directly into the first half, where the Crimson ran out to an 11-point lead after just eight minutes. Harvard did it on both ends of the floor, making 10 of its first 19 shots while turning the Terriers over nine times in the first 12 minutes. Junior Zena Edosomwan scored nine points during a 12-4 run late in the first half that had the margin at 17.
Edosomwan, who finished with 13 rebounds, nine points, three assists, and three steals against just one turnover, earned the praise of his coach after the win.
“What you see in Zena is a level of confidence that has grown tremendously and that’s as big as anything,” Amaker said. “It allows a player to relax in the play and have the confidence to make a pass or make a move.”
The Terriers continued to chip away at the lead from that point forward, however. Harvard scored just two points in the last six minutes of the first half, exiting with a 14-point lead that fell to eight after a 6-0 Terriers spurt to start the second.
When Harvard pushed the lead to 14 twice in the second half, BU responded instantly. The second time, after a Patrick Steeves trey with seven minutes to go, the Terriers went on an 8-0 run to cut it to six with 4:10 to go. Big men Eric Fanning and Nick Havener were the catalysts in each run, combining for 37 points as BU outscored Harvard 36-30 in the paint.
The Terriers never got closer than three, however, and Steeves secured the victory with two late free throws.
“We talked about the team getting better and that’s been the focus for us,” Amaker said. “Certainly having a win to go along with that was a significant moment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—For the second consecutive game, the Harvard men’s basketball team found itself in a 75-69 contest as the clock wound to zero. However on Tuesday night, the Crimson was on the winning side, beating Boston University (3-5) on the road.
Harvard (3-6) was coming off of a 75-69 loss to Kansas Saturday in which they gave the now-No. 2 team in the nation a run for its money. The victory over the Terriers halted a three-game skid for the Crimson, who had not won since an 80-45 victory over Bryant two weeks before.
Looking to end a four-game road trip on a high note before a two-week break from competition, Harvard never conceded the lead in the entire 40 minutes of play.
“After we got back from Kansas, we realized how much we have and how much we are capable of doing,” freshman guard Corey Johnson said. “We got together and just said from here on, we are 0-0 and we are starting fresh and battle for our wins.”
SPREADING THE FLOOR
With the BU squad already thinned by injuries, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker looked to his team to play inside-out offense, something the squad had struggled to execute early in the season.
The inside game for the Crimson begins with junior forward Zena Edosomwan, who has leads the team in scoring at just under 13 points per game. Though Edosomwan has been largely consistent, the Crimson has struggled to shoot consistently from the outside. Johnson, who is known for his shooting touch, is shooting 52 percent from deep in the team’s three wins, but just 35 percent in the team’s losses.
But on Tuesday night both Edosomwan and Johnson were clicking. Edosomwan finished with nine points and 13 rebounds, while Johnson tallied a career-high 18 points off 6-for-11 three-point shooting.
While all of Edosomwan’s points came in the first half, his presence as a threat inside effectively drew defenders away from Harvard’s other shooters.
“Partly the reason [Johnson] was open is because they were worried about Zena,” Amaker said. “It is still inside out whether we get the ball in there or whether their attention was on him, and that loosened things up on the perimeter.”
Johnson played a key role in the waning minutes as the Terriers fought back into the game behind two three-pointers from an otherwise silent John Papale. After getting beat by Papale on the defensive end, Johnson looked to Amaker on the bench to acknowledge his mistake, then burned BU on the offensive end.
WIth freshman Tommy McCarthy in traffic, Johnson caught the ball steps from the baseline and fired an off-kilter shot that hit nothing but net with 32 seconds remaining to put Harvard up six, halting the Terrier momentum.
“I practice shots like that in the gym sometimes for fun and situations like that,” Johnson said. “I spaced off my defender because he moved a little bit like I showed off him and I just shot it up.”
MATURING MCCARTHY
Coming into the season, how McCarthy would fill the shoes of Siyani Chambers ’15-’16, who is out for the season with an ACL injury, was the biggest question surrounding the team. When junior Matt Fraschilla also went down with an ACL injury in the team’s second game of the year, the weight on McCarthy’s shoulders got even heavier.
His play has, on occasion, reminded spectators that he is still a freshman. The team has struggled with turnovers throughout the year, with McCarthy averaging nearly three giveaways a game.
But over Harvard’s past two games, McCarthy has played much cleaner basketball. Against BU, he had five assists against just two turnovers. Amaker noted that a change in McCarthy’s confidence level has contributed to his improvement at the point position.
“You see how he’s played recently...managing the game and being our quarterback is what he’s been focused on,” Amaker said. “We’re much more efficient when he has that look about him.”
The Crimson bench held its breath midway through the second frame when the guard hit the floor as BU forward Nick Havener attempted to intercept a crosscourt pass intended for the freshman. McCarthy grabbed at his ankle in pain as the training staff attended to him, but was eventually able to stand up on his own power to walk into the huddle. Harvard knew it could breath easy when he knocked down his first two shots when he returned to action.
“I think Tommy’s seen, without a doubt, improvement in the confidence that his teammates have in him,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was game of runs on Tuesday night for the Harvard women’s basketball team, who lost at home, 85-81, against Eastern Michigan on Tuesday night. Despite setting a number of season highs on the offensive end of the ball, the Crimson (4-5) struggled on the defensive end, ultimately leading to a loss in the high-scoring affair.
Junior guard Cha Sweeney had 31 points—including 15 in the third quarter—for the visiting Eagles (5-2), who evened out the all-time series record to one win apiece.
HOT HAND ON OFFENSE
The Crimson lit up the court on the offensive end, as the team shot 52 percent from the field and 43 percent from deep. Co-captain and guard Kit Metoyer paced the way for Harvard, scoring a career high 18 points on 6-for-12 shooting from deep.
“[My teammates] were finding me early and getting me the ball in a really good spot, so I actually have the easy job of just shooting the shot,” Metoyer said. “I know my teammates and coaches have confidence in me every time I shoot the ball.”
Senior forward Shilpa Tummala also had a strong day from the three-point line, shooting 4-for-5 from downtown on her way to 12 points. Three other players—freshman guard Madeline Raster, co-captain AnnMarie Healy, and junior forward Destiny Nunley—were also in double figures, a season high for the Harvard squad.
Indeed, the Crimson set season-highs in many offensive categories—including field goals, field goal percentage, three-point field goals, and three-point field goal percentage. Harvard’s 81 points were also the most by the squad since February, when it scored 82 in a one-point win over Columbia.
FREE THROW WOES
Despite shooting well all night, the Crimson struggled on the defensive end, where it faced a huge deficit in attempts from the charity stripe.
Harvard, in fact, made more field goals than the Eagles but attempted only 10 free throws to the Eagle’s 24. Once at the charity stripe, the Crimson also struggled with shooting the ball, only converting 50 percent of its attempts.
“Everybody else has to want the ball more and work harder on the offensive boards, get to the line a little more,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “All we talked about was stopping the drive, and all we did was allow them to go the basket—and then foul them.”
Sweeney led Eastern Michigan in free throws, going 6-for-6. In comparison, the entire Crimson squad only made five free throws combined.
DEFENSIVE BREAKDOWNS
The defensive woes for the Crimson continued in the turnovers category, as Eastern Michigan stole the ball 13 times on the way to 20 turnovers for the Crimson. The Eagles had just six turnovers.
“Just bizarre passes, stupid passes,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’ve been pretty good for a young team that likes to run with our turnovers, so why tonight… I don’t know. I was very surprised by some of our decisions in our passes.”
The Crimson had particular trouble with Sweeney, a 5’2” guard for the Eagles, who drove into the lane at will for either an easy layup or a kick-out to an open shooter. Sweeney spearheaded a game-changing 15-0 run by Eastern Michigan in the third quarter, scoring 11 points in that timeframe to turn a ten point deficit into a five point lead.
“Stopping her [Sweeney] 1-on-1 wasn’t gonna be the way to go…. She really hurt us today because I think we lacked that help-side defense.” Metoyer said.
Overall, it was a lackluster defensive performance by the Harvard squad, which has now dropped three straight games after winning four of six to start the season.

With less than a minute left on the clock, the Harvard’s women’s basketball team trailed, 79-75, to Eastern Michigan. Crimson (5-4) co-captain AnneMarie Healy took the ball to the middle of the Eagle defense and fought through a foul to make the layup and the ensuing and-one free throw, but Eastern Michigan (5-2) held on for a close 85-81 win.
Harvard led by 10 points midway through the third quarter, but the Crimson’s defensive woes and offensive mistakes led to Eastern Michigan storming back into the game and ultimately a Harvard loss.
Eastern Michigan’s Cha Sweeney led all scorers with 31 points. The 5’2” guard spearheaded her team’s comeback in the third quarter with 10 points in a matter of minutes late in the quarter, including two and-ones and a three.
She had 27 in the second half.
Sweeney’s most telling contribution came with the score tied with 1:29 remaining in the contest. She faked left, went right, and as she went up to the rim, she reversed with her right hand, and banked in the blow to the Crimson faithful in attendance. Sweeney then made all four free throws to ice the game.
“We knew that going in she was kind of the head of the snake, and we knew that it wasn’t going to be on just one person to stop her,” said senior Kit Metoyer, who led the Crimson in scoring with six three-pointers.
The Crimson had a solid defensive plan going into the game, but the team did not execute the blueprint consistently during the contest.
“All we talked about was stopping the drive, and all we did was allow them to go the basket and then foul them,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “My team just likes offense, not defense. And it’s a huge weakness for us. It’s [going to] come back to haunt us.”
The defense allowed 19 offensive rebounds, which led to 17 second chance points. The Crimson were leaking points left and right, despite the Eagles shooting just 42 percent from the field.
Eastern Michigan pounded Harvard down low, scoring 40 points in the paint. The free throw disparity was pronounced as well, with Eastern Michigan beating Harvard, 24-10, in free throw attempts.
On the other side of the ball, there were more problems for the Crimson.
For a team that shot 52 percent from the field, hit 12 triples at a 43 percent clip, and totaled 24 assists, Harvard seemed to be en route to an offensive outburst. However, that was tempered by 20 Crimson turnovers, which led to Eastern Michigan finishing with 22 points of turnovers and 12 fast break points.
“I was very surprised by some of our decisions in our passes,” Delaney-Smith said. “Again, they were our point guards who just made very poor [and] bad decisions.”
As to why there we so many turn overs, Delaney-Smith didn’t feel there was too much defensive pressure on her offence.
“I thought the zone would bother us more, but we shot really well so it didn’t bother us,” Delaney-Smith said. “We got all the shots we wanted.”
The players were in agreement with their coach; with too many turnovers, it was going to be an uphill battle.
“Our goal every game is obviously to have 12, 13 turnovers and to have 20—it’s really hard to win a game when you’re turning over the ball that much and giving the team so many opportunities to capitalize,” Metoyer said.
