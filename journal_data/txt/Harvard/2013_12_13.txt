After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Some pieces of art offer an escape from reality, and others punch you in the gut. I left the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Company” in Farkas Hall on Sunday gasping for air. The show, directed by Dana Knox and Rose C. Bailey ’14, attacked every note in the Sondheim-penned songbook, sometimes sarcastically and sometimes tenderly. The result was a brutally awkward and emotionally wrecking show carried by a set of moving individual performances; each served as a searing indictment against shallow societal constructions, false relationships, and self-imposed isolation.
 
“Company” follows Bobby (Eric Padilla ’14), just off his 35th birthday, as he navigates single life among his married friends in New York City. The genius behind the musical lies in its anachronism and contradictions: it’s an old-fashioned song-and-dance Broadway show that deals in darker, more modern themes like sex, divorce, and depression. The joyous full-cast dance numbers and the lush harmonies all serve as smokescreens for a deep dissatisfaction coming from nearly every character. Knox and Bailey skillfully navigated this divide, especially in “Side by Side by Side,” the opening number of the second act. The cast put on its best ear-to-ear grins to schmaltz around the versatile two-leveled set—designed by Ethan R. Pierce ’14 and Christina M. Rodriguez ’15— all the while intermittently tap-dancing and line-kicking in a routine humorously choreographed by Julia K. Cataldo ’15. The orchestral band, directed by Ethan T. Addicott ‘14, played impeccably, and the vocal harmonies were crisp, but the leading man to which the song was dedicated was nowhere to be found. In his absence, they were singing into a void, and the exaggerated performances of the characters rendered the scene hollow and unsettling. 
Despite its title, “Company” leans heavily on the strength of individual performances. Padilla was essentially a blank slate until the last ten or so minutes, so it was up to the parade of supporting actors who streamed across the stage in short bursts to keep the show lively and moving. It’s a common cliché to say that one particular actor steals the show, but in “Company,” show-stealing performances came one after the other. First up to bat were Morgan E. Henry ’14 and Daniel W. Erickson ’14, who showed the best chemistry out of any couple with their frenzied, passionate portrayal of the dysfunctional pair Sarah and Harry. In a particularly inventive directorial choice, Henry, Erickson and Padilla formed a tableau piled on top of each other in furious battle while a set of cast members on the other side of the stage serenely sang the praises of marriage in “The Little Things You Do Together.” The lighting here, designed by Addicott, firmly emphasized the imbalance between the two scenes on opposite ends of the stage.
 
Next up was the adorable Olivia R. Miller ’16 as Bobby’s oddball love interest, April—almost solely for her deadpan delivery of the single awkward line, “I have nothing else to say”—and then Amy K. Sparrow ’15 as Amy, who convincingly transformed from psychopathic to tenderly loving in about 40 seconds. And when she got the chance, Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 (Joanne) rightly commanded full attention. The staging for “The Ladies Who Lunch” focused mainly on Leimkuhler as everyone else got out of the way. A single spotlight shone on Leimkuhler as she delivered her drunk, seething, virtuosic solo. It’s incredible how many shows Leimkuhler has hijacked in her three years as an undergraduate performer, and Sunday’s performance was no exception.
 
When the performances faltered slightly, Bailey and Knox turned up the awkwardness of the stage setup in order to drive home Bobby’s ongoing discomfort in his social interactions. Sometimes it was hard to tell whether performances fell flat or were consciously stiff; either way, the play was filled with tense, nervous sequences. The most striking of these included Bobby and April’s startlingly explicit sex scene on the floor-level bed in which the female leads swarmed around, scolding him, and Peter’s (Akshay M. Sharma ’14) come-on to Bobby in which Peter traps Bobby on the corner of a building ledge and inches closer and closer to him. These cringe-inducing performances highlighted the loneliness and desperation of the protagonist and of those around him.
 
Padilla came to life in the finale, “Being Alive,” euphorically showing off his wonderfully rich voice. But he retreated back into his shell for the closing scene, in which Bobby blows out the candles on his birthday cake alone in his apartment, his face once again registering uncertainty, longing, and resignation. “I would laugh if it weren’t all so tragic,” says Amy at one point. HRDC’s “Company” excellently walked the line between old-fashioned humor and modern tragedy, ultimately capturing the latter in a devastating way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the College dismissed a student accused of perpetrating multiple incidents of sexual misconduct. And just over two weeks ago, Harvard College appointed associate dean of student life and former resident dean William Cooper ’94 along with Administrative Board case manager Emily J. Miller as its first-ever Title IX coordinators. The first of these events represents the problem and the second, part of a sorely needed solution.
In appointing Cooper and Miller, Harvard has taken a significant step toward the sexual assault reform crucial to protecting student safety and wellbeing. While the creation of a policy-focused working group on sexual assault—an undertaking the University’s Title IX officer Mia Karvonides is currently facilitating—constitutes an essential part of the process, so too does the establishment of the new coordinator positions.
Harvard’s process for handling alleged cases of sexual assault has many flaws. The need for improvement is evidenced by the shocking infrequency of dismissal on the grounds of sexual assault; the expulsion announced last week marked a rare instance of the Faculty council opting for the harshest possible punishment, something that is not known to have occurred since 2010—when a student was forced to withdraw permanently for hacking into teaching staff email accounts. Assault survivors at Harvard have highlighted this same concern with the reporting and adjudication process: many claim that the College does not respond appropriately to student complaints, often letting the accused off with no punishment at all after what victims see as unbalanced and unjust closed-door deliberations.
Of course, creating two new jobs is no silver bullet. As we have previously opined, policy must change to ensure fairness to assault survivors once their cases reach the Ad Board. But as those survivors work through the reporting and investigative process, it is Harvard’s duty to offer them an easily accessible, effective support structure. Cooper and Miller, who will work with faculty, students, and staff to address sex discrimination and assault at the College, can aid in establishing an efficient and fair system.
In an ideal world, or at an ideal school, change to Harvard's sexual assault policies would not remain a goal for the distant future but instead would accompany the coordinative improvements with which Cooper and Miller have been tasked. But in our imperfect reality at our imperfect institution, something is better than nothing. As Harvard works with all deliberate speed to improve its system, we eagerly await news of further steps toward justice for all victims of sexual assault at the College and at the University as a whole.

Economists have faced a deluge of negative press in the past few years, ranging from criticisms over the failure to forecast the financial crisis, to the more recent disbelief over the granting of the Nobel Prize in Economics to three economists, two of whom hold views that can be said to be polar opposites. Indeed, the reputation of mainstream economics—specifically macroeconomics—is arguably at its worst since the formation of the field in the 1930s, with the advent of the Great Depression. This state of affairs prompted Raj Chetty, a professor of economics at Harvard, to author a defense of the field in ‘The New York Times,’ titled “Yes, Economics Is a Science.”
It seems as though economics is fighting for its right to stay in the exclusive group of fields deemed worthy enough to be called “science,” where subjects such as physics, chemistry, and molecular biology reside comfortably. Some instead opt to call economics, along with psychology and sociology, a “social science”—a vague term, often blurred with humanities, which is neither here nor there. Nevertheless, the underlying implication behind this battle is that to be a “science” is to be credible.
I don’t agree.
First and foremost, I don’t agree at all that economics is a science. Let me preface this by saying that I am concentrating in economics, and have the utmost respect for the field. Let me also clarify that when I say “economics” throughout this article, I primarily mean macroeconomics—microeconomics is an entirely different beast. While the two are intrinsically related, the methods of experimentation are so drastically different that the two can hardly be subject to the same criticisms.
Merriam-Webster’s definition of science is “a study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation.” What physics and chemistry and molecular biology have in common is that the building blocks of what they observe and experiment with don’t change. Such is the natural world. But what is the building block of economics? People. Economics does not study any unit smaller than a collection of people. And human behavior can never be absolutely predicted or explained—not if we wish to believe in free will, at any rate.
In fact, in a strict sense, economics does not even follow the scientific method. Engrained in the scientific method is the process of testing hypotheses with repeatable, falsifiable, and parameter-controlled experiments. Unfortunately for the field of economics, there are certain non-trivial barriers to experimentally tanking the Czechoslovakian economy over and over while controlling for interest rate levels. Oftentimes, the best economists can do is sit back and pore through the data given to them—data that is muddled by changing cultural standards, changing technological innovations, and changing time periods, among other factors.
All of this is not to say that I disapprove of economics, or think it illegitimate in any way—quite the opposite, actually. I believe that economics is a crucial field that directly impacts most everyone on this planet, perhaps more so than any other subject. The discovery of the Higgs-Boson made headline news around the world and has been heralded as one of the greatest triumphs of mankind’s collective intellect in history, but the Higgs-Boson has very little bearing, if any, on the daily lives of people. On the on the other hand, ill-timed economic austerity measures in Britain caused a very real, and very noticeable effect nearly immediately, setting the backdrop for the 2011 London riots.
This direct influence economics has on the individual lives of people stems from the fact that economics is, at its heart, a very person-centered and normative field of study. It is unique in the sense that economics fuses quantitative data and modeling with qualitative judgments; unlike in physics or chemistry, economics appends an implied “therefore…” statement to its conclusions. Economists’ findings that expanded insurance coverage increased lifespans and reduced costs lent implicit support to the Affordable Care Act—a law that will affect tens of millions of Americans.
Economics is not a science in the way that physics or chemistry is a science. Yet, this is not something to be lamented. Economics is not, and will never be, at the stage where models can precisely predict the day on which a financial crisis will start before it happens, but this is not due to the lack of legitimacy of the field; instead, it is due to the inherently unpredictable sphere of study in which economics operates. People are not atoms—and this is exactly why economics is immediately relevant.
What this means is that all of us—and the press in particular—should cease treating economics as though it were a science. We need to understand that economics is attempting to neatly model a very messy world.Do not expect clean answers.

Sometimes, it takes a bunch of penises to let you know life is going by. But it takes a little more to let you know that you don’t have to catch up to it (or them)—not yet.
When primal scream happened last year, I wrote about it. I said it was stupid and basically meaningless, which I thought was a good thing at a place like Harvard, where everything is smart and driven by meaning. My take on primal scream really hasn’t changed. Streaking around the Yard with my classmates this year, I felt just as bare and barely human as I did before. But there was one aspect that was different: an odd feeling that I was not among the pack of prestigious primates, but that they were among me.
Let me explain. I did primal scream the first time at the end of my first semester here. After adjusting to all the newness of college and working hard, I felt like it would be relieving to brave the cold completely nude, in the middle of the Yard. Thankfully, I found out about this thing called “primal scream,” which was scheduled for the very same night. Nervous and excited, I ran around and stripped down with all my new classmates; it was a pretty perfect, albeit surprising, end to the semester.
But this year I had a final the next day and the day after. By the time I stopped studying that night, I barely had time to disrobe and walk all the way from my house to get there. The cheering, the band, the Yard full of a thousand butts—it all was the same as before. But the feeling was a little different. As I went around, there was a sense that I wasn’t running, but just going along with the pack. The run, the adrenaline, the feeling: it was all familiar. But this time, it was somewhat dulled, almost less personal. I felt like I wasn’t doing primal scream—I felt like I was just a part of it.
It’s not just primal scream either. Coming back to Harvard, after being here for a year, felt similar in a lot of ways. It’s hard to know what it is exactly, but new things become more routine. You hang out with your close friends, rather than meeting many others. Classes are still interesting, but in a more manageable and somewhat repetitive way. “The people” you came here to meet become wrapped together in your mind into a group of driven, fame or finance hungry, stressful acquaintances. If you’re optimistic, they’re cool, fame or finance hungry, stressful acquaintances. And your willingness to explore new areas, whether academic, geographic, or otherwise, is somewhat dulled.
Based on speeches and comments by administrators, I’ve always felt like I should be pushing the envelope; that every time I hang out with my purposefully diverse group of friends, I should have my tongue hanging out with amazement when hearing their ideas and stories, and then use that tongue to lap up as many of those ideas as I can. But this year I really don’t feel like I’m doing all that: I haven’t licked my friends even once. I mostly focus on about two things on campus, and those happen to be classes. I just don’t feel like I’m as much of an active part of Harvard as I was when I was a freshman. It feels more like I’m just flowing along, without the same nervousness and excitement as before. I guess, even an almost 400-year-old place can grow old on you.
But, although it may seem like a bad feeling, I think there’s a reason why I don’t push myself the same way: the routine is pretty good. I don’t appreciate “the people” at Harvard as much as I appreciate the people who are my friends. I don’t like exploring as much as I like exploring what I like. For me, “the innovative” has become the daily. The “amazing” is predictable. And although it may have lost that great new shine after a year or so, the normal life here is something that is both rewarding and enjoyable, even if it’s not as exciting. I’m sure I'll get back to feeling active and searching for something new, but I’m enjoying my passivity for as long as it will have me.
It’s the same with primal scream. The other night, my friends and classmates were there to hold my stuff and cheer me on. I tripped over naked people and made faces at people with cameras. I felt the warmth of the moment and the bitter, nipple-shrinking cold of the walk back to my room. And, again, I got the great feeling of seeing my school come together for something stupid, with a hint of nostalgia to top it off this time.
Sure, this wasn’t my first primal scream. It didn’t have the same significance for me as last year’s. In fact, by the end of this year’s run (partly because it’s a “lap”), I felt like I was basically in the same place I had started.
But, and there’s always a but(t) with these things, it felt good just to go along for the ride, all the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This November, students of Harvard College were able to decide who would become the next President and Vice President of the Undergraduate Council. I think Harvard’s students chose poorly by electing Samuel B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15. But the blame lies not with the student body or the Clark-Mayopoulos comedy duo. It lies with the model for the UC election system: the United States presidential system.
Until casting my ballot on November 18, I was not sure if I would be able to vote in the UC election. Not being able to vote would have been especially frustrating for me, since only a few months ago I myself was heading a student government. I am a Visiting Undergraduate Student from the University of Munich (LMU), and I was Geschäftsführer, the presidential equivalent, of LMU’s student government. My VUS status is also why I was unsure about my voting rights.
The electoral system of Harvard’s UC in some respects closely mirrors the political system of the United States: members of the legislature are elected by communities that they represent in a kind of parliament, and the head of the executive branch is chosen through a popular election.
It makes sense that the UC mirrors the US political system. Students thinking about getting into politics can join the first to find out if they later want to become a part of the second. American students’ widespread familiarity with presidential democracy also makes it easier to engage them: to encourage them to participate in the voting process and in the UC itself.
But the US presidential system is seriously flawed. Letting the general populace decide who will occupy the highest executive office more often than not results in a popularity contest and the election of a mere figurehead. In an election in which the voters know little about the true competence and experience of the candidates, the threat that likeability will be the chief indicator of electoral success becomes even greater. This is exactly what happened in this year’s UC presidential election.
Clark and Mayopoulos organized a well thought out and extremely funny campaign. Promising to bring tomato basil ravioli soup to dining halls every day and to make thicker toilet paper a reality for all Harvard students, Clark-Mayopoulos convinced a majority of the ballot-casting student body, disinterested in collegiate politics, to vote for them.
Harvard’s students chose Clark-Mayopoulos over C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15, who were endorsed by 93 percent of endorsing UC representatives and various student organizations on campus, including The Crimson, The Harvard Democrats, and The Harvard Republican Club. Gong and Goffard, who are experienced and successful at student lobbying, would have been elected by students interested in the issues. But they were not chosen by the general student populace.
Gong-Goffard, and not Clark-Mayopoulos, would have been elected to head the student government of the University of Munich. The student government of my home institution mirrors the political system of Germany insofar as the chief executive is elected by the legislature (that is, the student parliament). Instead of a fancy campaign, a written application and a speech followed by a thorough Q&A session give the electorate the information it needs to make a decision. Fewer people are involved in choosing who becomes president, but this process is not necessarily a less democratic one. Since the students elected the members of the parliament, the LMU system is just a form of representative, rather than direct, democracy.
Had Clark and Mayopoulos both resigned (as they’d promised) after being inaugurated, the UC would have subsequently, in effect, enacted the core features of the Munich model: the UC members themselves would have elected a President and Vice President. That Goffard, who has proven himself competent and effective, will become Vice President is at least a positive development. It remains to be seen whether Mayopoulous, who did not resign along with Clark and was inaugurated as President on December 8, will be more than a funny figurehead.
By modeling itself after the US political system, the UC gains the advantage of familiarity and provides training for students interested in public service. But, as I believe I’ve shown, the current system is seriously flawed. I am not positive that the UC should have the legislature elect the President and Vice President in 2014. But maybe the UC should make the change? After all, it could do worse.

Harvard professors said proposed changes to the National Institute of Health’s grant giving policy would increase the flexibility given to Harvard’s senior faculty while posing new challenges for younger researchers and associate professors just starting their labs.
At an address to the Advisory Committee to the Director on Dec. 5, NIH Director Francis S. Collins announced that the NIH was considering shifting their methods of awarding grants to focus on people, rather than projects—funding the most eligible researchers rather than the most eligible research. In interviews this week, Harvard professors said that the NIH’s greater emphasis on “people over projects” contains numerous potential advantages for well-established professors and scientists.
“The major problem with the system currently is everybody spends so much time taking care of the money and not doing the science or the thinking,” said David D. Cox ’00, assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology. “Moving towards people-based systems might have some potential to free us from that.”
Collins said he plans to advocate for the expansion of the NIH Director’s Pioneer Award Program, which evaluates a researcher’s potential to succeed in tackling a research question instead of evaluating a specific research proposal.
NIH’s Pioneer Award Program was originally modeled on the system used by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the largest private health research funder in the nation. HHMI awards grants to qualified researchers, independent of specific research proposals. While a “people not projects” approach may eliminate what professors called the “artifice” of the grant-application process for scientists, Cox and others point to a bias towards experienced or older researchers as problematic. If Collins’s changes are implemented in the next year, they said, the NIH’s Pioneer Program may further disadvantage younger researchers and raise the age at which scientists receive their first NIH grant.
“This might exclude people who have good new ideas but no past record,” Cox said.
E.J. Corey, professor of organic chemistry, said that he found the grant-seeking process so discouraging to younger professors that he stopped applying for grants 15 years ago. Instead, Corey funds his lab with money he made while consulting and from other private sources.
“I’d heard so many horror stories that I decided that I didn’t want to take money away from the younger generations,” he said.
According to Corey, the research establishment has grown so exponentially in the latter half of the 20th century that any further expansion is unsustainable.
“This is literally like moving a mountain with a slingshot,” Corey said. “The research establishment has grown quite a lot since the middle half of the last century, and there are now huge numbers of independent researchers in the medical schools.”
Both Cox and Corey believe that the best possible solution to the diminishing federal funds would be a mixture of both people and project based funding.
“It’s got to be a multicomponent program,” Corey said. “You’ve got to help young folks just starting in medical research to get their research off the ground, but there also needs to be a system of support for people beyond the starting phase.”

After nine days of recount, the Cambridge City Council elections officially came to a close on Thursday, as candidate Dennis Carlone’s victory over incumbent Minka Y. vanBeuzekom was confirmed. VanBeuzekom requested the recount after she lost her seat on the Council by a small margin in the November election.
“The results themselves changed, but the winners did not,” Election Commissioner Ethridge King told The Crimson as the recount neared its end. The margin between Carlone and vanBeuzekom actually narrowed during the recount, but Carlone still managed to secure his seat.
After King declared that “the candidate Carlone is now officially elected,” the room full of exhausted observers and ballot counters quickly emptied. Carlone’s attorney and campaign manager were present to receive the good news, although vanBeuzekom’s campaign did not send a representative.
“Every recount is stressful; that’s just the nature of it. With things being so close, Minka had every right to ask for one,” said Carlone, whose campaign platform included promises to amend the existing Code of Conduct for City Officials and Employees, create a Cambridge-wide “master plan” for development, and draft a “Neighborhood Bill of Rights” to improve the quality of life enjoyed by Cambridge residents.
The election itself was one of the most intense in recent memory, with 25 candidates competing for nine seats on the council. The recount confirmed the nine top candidates, in alphabetical order by last name, as Dennis Benzan, Carlone, Leland Cheung, Craig A. Kelley, David P. Maher, Nadeem Mazen, Marc McGovern, E. Denise Simmons, and Timothy J. Toomey Jr.
VanBeuzekom, whose 10th place in the general election was confirmed by the recount, was first elected to the Council in 2011. The recent loss marks an end to her first and only term. She could not be reached for comment Thursday night.
Among the defeated included Harvard’s own Logan Leslie ’16, who led a controversial campaign to become the first Harvard student in history to be elected to the council. Logan secured enough votes to finish 14th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few academics are accused of being war criminals, and fewer still would choose to print the accusation on the back cover of their book. Alan M. Dershowitz, however, is not a typical academic, and has covered the dust jacket of his recent autobiography, “Taking the Stand: My Life in the Law,” with criticism and praise alike. 
The same man that MIT professor Noam Chomsky describes as “not very bright [and]...strongly opposed to civil liberties” is lauded by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the greatest defender of truth. And where former President Bill Clinton calls Dershowitz “hopeful and wise,” journalist Glenn Greenwald asserts that the Harvard Law School professor is “deranged.” 
Dershowitz, 75, has been a lightning rod for dispute throughout his legal career. As arguably the best-known criminal lawyer in the United States and perhaps Harvard Law School’s most prominent professor, he has argued some of the most divisive cases in the country and frequently broadcasts his opinion on issues ranging from terrorism in Israel to the use of torture as a coercive technique. 
In one week, Dershowitz will retire from a 50-year career at the Law School during which he taught more than 10,000 students, including many who have gone on to join him on the faculty. Harvard loses a man who blurred the lines between his roles as teacher and lawyer, trademarking what colleagues call “the aggressive argument.”
“There’s more streetfighter in Alan than traditional academic,” concludes Law School professor Charles R. Nesson ’60.
A CONTROVERSIAL ‘TORCHBEARER’
First in his class at Yale Law School, editor of the Yale Law Journal, clerk at the Supreme Court, and one of the youngest tenured professors at Harvard, Dershowitz had a rapid rise to stardom in the legal field. 
Over the years, he has represented big-name clients ranging from O.J. Simpson to Mike Tyson. “He’s not a name dropper, though he could be,” Law School professor emeritus David R. Herwitz says. 
Yet Dershowitz is perhaps best known for expressing bold opinions that would earn both himself and the Law School much notoriety. Armed with tenure at age 28—and all of the job security that such an appointment affords—Dershowitz began accumulating allies and opponents, a mix epitomized by the comments on the back of his book. 
“Law professors should stir up controversy. Law professors should take stances on public issues,” says legal journalist Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82, a former Crimson sports and editorial editor who took criminal law with Dershowitz and covered him at various points throughout his career. “I certainly don’t agree with everything he says, but the whole point of tenure is that you’re supposed to take a strong stance.”
Nesson adds that Dershowitz’s style of argument mirrors his often outspoken nature. “In a way, [controversy] sort of is his career. He’s not up to charm you,” Nesson says. “It’s sort of like he doesn’t take prisoners. When he’s up against you, he’s not pulling any punches, so you might come out of it feeling like you got pretty well knocked around. He’s not above a personal attack.”
“Alan epitomizes aggressive argument,” Nesson continues. “He wins by overpowering in a sense, by just being stronger.”
Dershowitz’s tenure has also tied him to Harvard, and he is seen by many as the face of the Law School. 
“Among the general public, when they imagine Harvard Law School, they imagine him,” says Law School professor I. Glenn Cohen, calling Dershowitz a “torchbearer” for the school. “For people who like him, that’s great and is a positive thing for the Law School. For people who don’t, maybe it’s a less positive thing.”
Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr., whose office is near Dershowitz’s on the top floor of the Law School’s Hauser Hall, in an area they call the “secure ward,” says they both receive a considerable number of threats.
Still, such harassment has not deterred Dershowitz—in fact, he frequently engages in “deep and spirited dialogue” with those who contest his opinions, according to Ogletree. “He’s a man who believes in jumping in the fire,” Ogletree says. “Controversy has never been a factor in preventing him from expressing his point of view.”
A STREETFIGHTER’S CLASSROOM
This fearless approach to argument has come to dominate Dershowitz’s approach to litigation and to teaching—two roles he often seems to blend.
“In my own life, I’ve tried to bring my theory into the courtroom and my practice into the classroom,” Dershowitz says. “Superb lawyers have to be able to integrate theory and practice.” 
And Dershowitz credits his performance in the courtroom—he calls himself the most successful appellate murder lawyer in history and has argued 37 homicide cases—to his experience in the classroom.
“It’s very gratifying because I win them through science,” he says. “I win them by bringing the classroom into the courtroom.” In a recent victory, for example, Dershowitz argued the reversal of a life imprisonment sentence using the content of his course on law and psychiatry.
In turn, Dershowitz’s time in court informs his pedagogical approach, in which he neglects hypotheticals in favor of cases he has personally experienced and argues with his students as though they are opposing counsel.
“He’s very challenging,” says Law School student Michele Materni, who took two classes from Dershowitz and now works as his teaching fellow for a freshman seminar at the College. “He loves to put out his ideas, and he loves it even more when students challenge him.” 
Those moments of discord stand out for Dershowitz, who calls himself “Socratic with a smile.” 
“I never insult my students, but I push them very, very hard,” he says. While the Socratic method has recently come under fire at the Law School, Dershowitz defends the technique. “I think if we were to ever get rid of the Socratic method, it would be a disaster for legal education,” he says. “Our job is to make [students] squirm, to make them rethink their ideas, to make them challenge what they regard as fundamental notions.”
But while Dershowitz may force his students to defend their opinions with the same gusto with which he attacks his critics and opponents, he insists that his students need not share his views. 
“I don’t want to influence Ted Cruz to become more liberal. I want to teach him to have better analytic skills that will make him a better conservative,” says Dershowitz of former pupil Ted Cruz, the firebrand Republican Senator from Texas who graduated from the Law School in 1995. “I think the worst professors are those who use their captive audiences to persuade them of their own ideology or perspectives.”
NO REGRETS
When the Law School semester officially ends next week, Dershowitz will leave a job he has held for the last half century.
Dershowitz says he has no regrets. “I’ve done what I’ve wanted to do, I’ve written the books I’ve wanted to write, I’ve taught the classes I’ve wanted to teach,” he says. 
For Dershowitz, the professorial lifestyle has allowed him to “do everything.”
“I have a terminal case of FOMS, fear of missing something, and I never wanted to miss anything,” Dershowitz says. “My life has been based off of trying to do everything at the same time.”
Looking ahead, Dershowitz plans to split his time between Miami Beach, Martha’s Vineyard, and New York, writing, litigating, and having fun, he says—but not teaching.  
Still, he does not view next week as his retirement. “I think of it as a career change,” he says. “I’ve had one job for 50 years just teaching at Harvard, and now I’m 75, so I’m thinking of what I want to do next.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following over a year of visible student protests asking Harvard to divest from its holdings in fossil fuel companies, University President Drew G. Faust released a letter affirming the University’s stance against divestment.
“Climate change represents one of the world’s most consequential challenges. I very much respect the concern and commitment shown by the many members of our community who are working to confront this problem,” she wrote in her letter dated Oct. 3, 2013. “While I share their belief in the importance of addressing climate change, I do not believe, nor do my colleagues on the Corporation, that university divestment from the fossil fuel industry is warranted or wise.”
Faust’s letter added weight to the idea that Harvard “operates with a strong presumption against divestment,” according to University spokesperson Kevin Galvin. But members of Divest Harvard, the student group currently spearheading the divestment movement, say this letter serves as a source of motivation, rather than discouragement.
“Having a concrete ‘no’ is something to work against... it makes our campaign stronger,” said Pennilynn R. Stahl ’15, the student outreach coordinator for Divest Harvard.
The campaign is not backing down. Just this past Sunday, over 150 students from schools in the Boston area gathered on Harvard’s campus to rally for divestment.
Whether or not divestment happens in the near future, activists are hopeful that it eventually will. In the meantime, they hope to bring immediate awareness to the effects of climate change and how divestment might lend urgency to that issue.
“It’s going to be a fight that’s going to take time,” Stahl said of divestment. “I don’t know how many years it will take, but we just want to continue building awareness of this issue and placing pressure on the administration.”
IT’S MORAL, NOT ECONOMIC
Since its creation in 2012, Divest Harvard has been committed to one goal—convincing Harvard University to divest its direct holdings in fossil fuel companies.
The movement, which has brought together students, faculty, alumni, and staff from across the Harvard community, aims to rebrand the fossil fuel companies as “social pariahs” in hopes of lessening the influence of these organizations. Therefore divestment, advocates say, is not an economic tactic, but a moral and political one.
“Divestment is a social movement. It’s trying to collapse down the social chain that exists between people’s actions and their investments,” said Benjamin Franta, a Ph.D. candidate in applied physics at Harvard and an organizer of Divest Harvard. “It’s about changing a broader societal psychology that surrounds an issue that has very long lasting effects.”
Activists have turned to divestment throughout Harvard’s history, calling for it in hopes of ending the system of apartheid in South Africa and reducing the influence of the tobacco industry.
In 1990, Harvard divested from tobacco companies, following a national trend that Franta said did not “bring the industry to its knees,” but did contribute to changing public attitudes towards smoking. Members of Divest Harvard hope to replicate that success with the fossil fuel movement.
“They have successfully managed to prevent any legislation at the level we need to really do something about the [climate change] crisis,” Alli J. Welton ’15, an undergraduate organizer of Divest Harvard, said of fossil fuel companies. “By taking away their social license with divestment, we can create space for the government to finally act.”
Divest Harvard grew from an undergraduate coalition known as Students for a Just and Stable Future, which aims broadly to encourage activism related to climate change.
Though the divestment movement at Harvard is barely a year old, student organizers say that the rapid growth and fervor of the movement comes from the urgency of climate change.
Divest Harvard organizers point to research indicating that the potential ramifications of the climate crisis are varied and severe, ranging from rising sea levels that could destroy entire countries to climate disruption that could cause harsher droughts and floods.
The sentiments of Harvard’s student divestment leaders are shared with student activists from across schools nationwide.
“The ultimate goal is to get [legislative] action on climate change that would make it illegal to burn more fossil fuels than it is safe to burn,” said Daniel L. Jubelirer, an active member of Tufts Divest for Our Future. “Green energy is feasible, it just isn’t being funded.”
But the divestment movement is only one piece of the sustainability puzzle, said Franta. By changing the way people think about climate change on a massive scale, he said, divestment supports and accelerates the efforts of policy and technological change.
“Infrastructural technologies societies use to sustain economies are developed over a long period of time, under the support of permanent economic policies,” Franta said. “So it really comes down to the political level. How much money will we put into low carbon industry research? Are we going to intentionally try to phase out use of fossil energy sources or are we just going to keep using it?”
IS IT PRACTICAL?
Though Harvard maintains its firm stance against divestment, it has not ignored the national movement towards sustainability. In December 2012 Harvard announced the creation of a separate social choice fund to which donors could choose to direct their gifts. Two months later, amid rising calls from student groups, the Harvard Management Company created the position of vice president for sustainable investing.
In her October letter to the Harvard community, Faust described the vice presidential position as helping HMC to “think in more nuanced, forward-looking ways about sustainable investment, including the consideration of environmental, social, and governance factors.”
According to a Harvard official, Jameela Pedicini, who was appointed to the position earlier this year, has already begun meeting with Harvard students.
Administrators maintain that the most effective way to address climate change and sustainability is through Harvard’s significant teaching and research on climate and environmental issues.
In her letter, Faust pointed to the academic work being done across the University, as well as the efforts of the Office for Sustainability, all of which the endowment helps to support.
“Conceiving of the endowment not as an economic resource, but as a tool to inject the University into the political process or as a lever to exert economic pressure for social purposes, can entail serious risks to the independence of the academic enterprise,” she wrote.
“The endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.”
There are environmentalists and academics alike who say they understand the University’s position and do not wholeheartedly support the divestment movement, although they applaud the student efforts.
Christie Lee, Vice President for Sustainability of the Energy Environment Club at Harvard Business School, said she believes that from a practical standpoint, divestment will be difficult to achieve.
“If you consider divesting from [the top] 200 fossil fuel companies, the largest market cap companies in the stock exchange, actually detangling Harvard’s endowment from that will take quite a while,” she said.
Environmental Science and Engineering Professor Daniel P. Schrag, who serves on President Barack Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, said he commends the students’ symbolic efforts to use the endowment to “point a moral finger” at the rest of society, but is not convinced that the University should follow through with student requests.
“Harvard divesting doesn’t build windmills, doesn’t make solar panels. It doesn’t transform oil to biofuels,” Schrag said. Real change, he added, will take a long time and effort from every individual.
“Everyone I know drives a car, rides airplanes, plugs in their laptops with electricity that uses coal and natural gas. This is on all of us...we need to rebuild the infrastructure that supports our modern existence,” Schrag said.
NOT GIVING UP
Although they have heard administrators’ stance time and time again, students are not letting up the pressure on Harvard to divest.
“We’re going to keep going with our campaign until it happens,” Stahl said.
But they have also broadened the scope of their efforts in hopes of influencing other underwriters of the coal industry. In late November, a group of students from Students for a Just and Stable Future staged a protest at a Bank of America recruiting event as part of a campaign by the Rainforest Action Network to persuade banks to divest from the fossil fuel industry.
“Whether it is Harvard or Bank of America, we absolutely need to decarbonize their lending portfolios,” said Todd Zimmer, a campaigner for the Rainforest Action Network. “I think [the] administration should understand that if they aren’t willing to make progress on campus, then students will continue to grow, continue to put pressure on all different parts of the carbon web whether it’s banks or higher institutions.”
Stahl said that for Divest Harvard, this semester was mostly focused on faculty and alumni outreach. Next year, the organization will try to mobilize the student body. Through student, alumni, faculty, and media support, Stahl said the plan is to continue to “put pressure on Harvard to the point where [the] Harvard administration will feel like it has to divest to maintain student support.”
Student members of Divest Harvard are optimistic that the movement will eventually prevail.
“We’re going to succeed because there are millions of lives at stake in the climate crisis, including our own,” Welton said. “We don’t have any choice but to fight harder.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scores of veteran Harvard affiliates are celebrating the long career of John P. “Jack” Reardon ’60 after Reardon announced last week that he will step down next year from the executive directorship of the Harvard Alumni Association. Reardon said on Friday that he will remain active with University fundraising and other projects, including working with the Harvard Board of Overseers and on Ivy League athletic policy.
“It is rare for a single person to transform an institution as much as Jack Reardon has transformed Harvard,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement on Friday, calling Reardon “an invaluable advisor” and praising his “admirable combination of humility and humor.” Speaking with The Crimson on Thursday, former University presidents Lawrence H. Summers, Neil L. Rudenstine, and Derek C. Bok all echoed Faust, calling Reardon a close and trusted advisor.
The HAA is only the most recent post in Reardon’s long career at Harvard, which began in 1956 when Reardon matriculated at the College, eventually working out of Kirkland House and earning a degree in government. After earning an MBA at the University of Pennsylvania and working at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, Reardon returned to Harvard in 1965, accepting a position at the college’s admissions office, through which he would eventually assume the role of director of admissions.
“I thought I would really love [the job] because I did so believe in the place, and I thought ‘if I don’t take it, I’ll make just enough money so I’ll never do it,’” Reardon remembered in an interview on Thursday. “I took it and I’ve never been unhappy for a minute.”
While at the admissions office, Reardon served as a proctor and then as Kirkland’s Allston Burr Senior Tutor—the precursor to the Resident Dean position—and also worked in the Harvard development office. In 1978, he moved across the river and became Harvard’s fifth athletic director.
As athletic director, Reardon is widely credited with spearheading major advances in Harvard’s womens athletic teams. Bok saw him as a trailblazer for the entire program, ushering Harvard’s athletic facilities out of an era of embarrassing disrepair.
“I remember sitting in a barber’s chair reading Sports Illustrated, and the article said the two universities with the worst, most dilapidated athletic facilities in the country were Harvard and East Maryland Shores,” Bok remembered on Friday, explaining how Reardon oversaw massive renovations of Harvard’s facilities and the program in general.
“Jack’s more responsible for [the turnaround] than any other single human being,” Bok said. “In that and in so many other ways he’s just helped the University progress and flourish.”
When Reardon left the athletic department in 1990, having added at least a dozen sports to the women’s program, he headed for the HAA. He also began to more closely advise Harvard’s leaders, beginning with Bok, and to take a leading role in the University’s fundraising efforts.
“Jack was able to generate the kind of enthusiasm in the alumni association with his typical kind of warmth that I think proved to be absolutely essential to the success of the drive,” recalled Rudenstine, who led a campaign that raised $2.6 billion during his presidency, outpacing an original goal of $2.1 billion. “Who knows if we would have succeeded otherwise, but it would have been much harder.”
Both as a fundraiser and as head of the HAA—roles that often work in tandem—past colleagues said that Reardon has taken advantage of his deep connections to myriad disparate elements of the University, many of which he forged earlier in his career as, at different points, a tutor, an admissions officer, and a recruiter.
“We live within an institution where specialization and compartmentalization is often valued above all else,” said Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, the secretary of the HAA and a lecturer on History and Literature and on Public Policy.
“Somebody like Jack, who builds bridges and connects people across various boundaries, is not only rare but essential.”
Moving forward, Reardon was quick to point out that he is not retiring, but stressed that he felt the time was right to leave behind the management responsibilities of the HAA’s executive directorship.
“It makes me feel good that I’m still going to be around,” he said. “I’m 75 years old...I’d rather be moving out of [the HAA] at my own speed rather than having people think ‘when in the hell is he going to get out of here.’”
Those who he has so closely advised over the years have tended to agree.
“Jack has done more to make Harvard into a big family than anyone,” Summers said. “I’m not sure Harvard will see Jack’s like again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although Harvard prides itself on its 1636 founding, the city of Boston established the nation’s oldest educational institution—Boston Latin School—a full year earlier.
“There’s a joke that Harvard was started a year after our school as a place for our students to go,” said James Montague, a counselor at Boston Latin.
375 years later, Boston Latin students still go north of the Charles to continue their education—by Montague’s count, the school contributed 15 students to Harvard’s current freshman class, one of only a handful of schools to send 10 or more students to the College this year, according to numbers obtained from Harvard’s freshman register.
In total, one out of every 20 Harvard freshmen attended one of the seven high schools most represented in the class of 2017—Boston Latin, Phillips Academy in Andover, Stuyvesant High School, Noble and Greenough School, Phillips Exeter Academy, Trinity School in New York City, and Lexington High School.
Although these schools vary significantly, ranging from private boarding schools to local public schools, their administrators and alumni trace their success to some or all of three different factors: a selective admissions process, strong college counselling, and academic cultures that foreshadow the Harvard experience.
FIRST ROUND OF APPLICATIONS
For most of the students at Harvard’s so-called “feeder schools,” applying to college feels almost familiar—many of the high-schools who are well-represented at the College have their own selective admissions requirements.
“I think, if anything, the process [of applying to high school] is a bit more strenuous than it was for applying to college,” said Tez M. Clark ’17, who is also a Crimson editorial writer, about her experience applying to Exeter nearly five years ago. “I definitely felt nervous.”
Exeter and similar private boarding schools require a substantial application, which takes into account test scores, letters of recommendations, grades, and personal essays. The most prestigious schools receive thousands of applications a year, from all over the world, and have admissions rates similar to those of top-tier colleges. Phillips Academy in Andover—which sent 18 students to Harvard this year—accepted only 13 percent of those who applied.
At many of the public schools who consistently send students to Harvard—like Boston Latin and New York’s Stuyvesant—admission depends on the result of competitive tests that students take in elementary or middle school.
“You’re very young, and you’re experiencing a lot of things that you don’t usually experience until you’re a high school senior,” said Stuyvesant alumnus Konrad E. Surkont ’16, recalling the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test that determines placement in New York’s nine specialized public high schools.
Harvard students from selective high schools, both public and private, said that their high schools’ admissions requirements might explain why so many of their classmates matriculate at Harvard.
“To me, it’s understandable that there are more students from Exeter than from a different school just because Exeter has already selected very competitive students, and Harvard’s drawing from a high concentration of competitive applicants,” Clark said.
According to John G. Palfrey ’94, a former Harvard Law School professor who now serves as the Andover’s headmaster, selective high schools attract potential Harvard students away from their home high schools.
“I think often a student who comes here has either exhausted the offerings of their home school or they are feeling like they’re up for a different kind of challenge during high school,” he said. “So they certainly work very hard.”
PATH TOWARD COLLEGE
As early as fall of their students’ junior year, the top-represented high schools at the College use thorough counseling programs geared toward preparing students for college applications.
According to David Ding ’16, an Andover alumnus, each student at Andover is assigned a college counselor who keeps track of application deadlines, writes letters of recommendation, and reviews student essays.
“We encourage students to apply to a broad range of schools, and we’re really trying to help them find a match,” Palfrey said of Andover’s counseling program. “For some students that match may be an Ivy League school, and for other students that school may be another one.”
Casey J. Pedrick, Director of College Counseling at Stuyvesant, said she and her counseling team make themselves available to students almost 24/7 during the college application process, leaving their doors open whenever a student needs advice.
“We’re really good about being able to answer emails at night and making ourselves available for communications over the summer,” Pedrick said. “They’re always thankful when they see an email or a reply back at midnight.”
Noble and Greenough School also tries to form a strong connection between its college counseling program and its students, according to Ben M. Snyder, head of the Upper School at Noble and Greenough.
“All of our college counselors also teach, and then 75 percent of their job is college counseling,” said Snyder. “We want as many people as possible in the classroom with kids.”
Like counseling programs at other secondary schools that regularly send students to Harvard, Noble and Greenough’s program is comprehensive. It advises students on which courses and standardized tests to take, helps students determine their academic interests, and communicates with students about application deadlines.
“We’re very lucky,” said Snyder. “Both in being able to have really talented kids come into the school and then providing this program for those kids.”
‘A NATURAL CONTINUATION’
Because students from these secondary schools were exposed to educational and extracurricular opportunities similar to those offered by universities, they felt encouraged to apply to schools like Harvard.
“Harvard is a natural continuation of boarding school,” Ding said of Andover. “We had really hard classes, we had opportunities to do research, to participate in all sorts of different extracurricular activities.”
Palfrey, who attended Exeter during high school, also said his move from preparatory school to college was facilitated by his experience studying with intelligent students and exploring the school’s course offerings.
“I felt like I had an easy time with the transition to college,” Palfrey said,  “Whereas for others there was a larger cultural leap between their high school experience and their Harvard college experience.”
Noble and Greenough, like Andover, gears its curriculum toward college preparation, offering classes like “Biochemistry Research” and “Politics and Ethics.”
“Each department sets their own curriculum and what they do is they try to gear it to challenge our most talented kids,” Snyder said. “Often times that means coursework that would be much more like a college seminar.”
“I feel like college admissions officers know what they will be getting,” said Surkont about Stuyvesant High School, reflecting on its alumni’s successes at Harvard. “A lot of college admissions offices are familiar with the Stuyvesant brand.”
Stuyvesant, like many other selective secondary schools, has a long history of sending students to the Ivy League.
In fact, Noble and Greenough, Exeter, and Andover were all founded by Harvard College graduates, and Noble and Greenough was originally established as an all-boys preparatory school for Harvard.
And Harvard’s relationship with Boston Latin is well established.
“There is no doubt there is a long rich tradition between Harvard and Boston Latin School,” Montague said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 13, 2013, at 5:49 p.m.
Harvard College accepted just over 21 percent of the 4,692 early applicants to the Class of 2018, the College announced Friday, the highest early action acceptance rate since Harvard reinstated the program in 2011 after a four-year hiatus. 
This year’s 992 early acceptances represent nearly an 11 percent increase over the number of prospective students accepted early last year.
“This year’s applicants are remarkable by any standard. Their academic and extracurricular strengths are impressive—as is their ethnic, economic, and geographic diversity,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in a press release. 
The pool from which this year’s early admits were drawn decreased in size by 3 percent after a 15 percent increase between 2011 and 2012.
Fitzsimmons said in the press release that he was happy to see the pool size stabilize this year. 
“The ‘early frenzy’, as some have referred to it, adds pressure to a generation that is already stressed by high expectations and economic uncertainty,” he said. 
Economic disparity within the early applicant pool has been an issue of concern in the past five years. In 2007, when Harvard announced that would eliminate its early action program, then-University President Derek C. Bok claimed that such programs “advantage the advantaged.”  
Fitzsimmons said in an interview Friday that the demographic information received so far from the early admits to the Class of 2018 indicated less of a disparity than has existed in years prior. The pool’s diversity is “better,” he said, but “not representative of what the total pool is going to look like—it’s an early snapshot, but it’s a very imperfect snapshot.” 
Thanks to ongoing outreach efforts to encourage a diverse applicant pool, Fitzsimmons said, “I think now I can say that it appears we were successful at least in the first phase in getting the message out to students from poorer economic backgrounds, and from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, and, for that matter, international students.” 
In October, Harvard announced the launch of the Harvard College Connection, a digitally-driven admissions initiative that seeks to encourage high-achieving low-income students to apply to Harvard and other selective institutions.
The increased volume of students admitted through this year’s early action program indicates a “new normal,” Fitzsimmons said, attributing the rise in part to the fact that promising students around the nation and world are choosing to apply to colleges early. 
Still, he said, Harvard is more concerned that students apply at all than that they apply early. “We continue to send a message that you do not have to apply early to Harvard,” Fitzsimmons said. 
Among those early applicants who were not offered admission Friday afternoon, 3,197 were deferred to the regular action decision process, 366 were denied admission, 18 withdrew, and 119 submitted incomplete applications.
Three other Ivy League schools which, unlike Harvard, operate a binding early decision program also sent out their early admissions notifications this week. Dartmouth College extended offers of admission to 28 percent of its 1,678 early applicants, while Brown University accepted 18.9 percent of its 3,088 applicants, the school’s largest ever early applicant pool. Columbia University, which notified admitted students on Thursday, also saw a record-high number of early applications, receiving 3,298.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In rugby, the men’s and women’s teams play exactly the same game. There are the same rules, the same setup, and the same plays for both teams despite the gender differences.
At Harvard, the rugby teams are no different. However, the distinction made only this year is the move for the women’s team from a club sport to a varsity one.
“We, as a set of rugby players, very badly want to be playing at the highest level of our sport,” women's co-captain Xanni Brown said. “We believed that the support that being a Harvard [varsity] athletic team gets you can help us play at a level previously not accessible to us.”
Originally, both rugby teams were club sports that were managed by a board of players that made executive decisions regarding everything from practices to team finances.
“We have an undergraduate board of elected members and in addition to that we have several coaches,” said Cody Kiechle, president of the men’s rugby squad. “We’re lucky to have a lot of freedom with the decisions we make. Everything from what uniforms to buy and what games to play in, when to have practices… it’s really all up to the undergraduates.”
The women’s squad has undergone changes since the switch, both regarding administrative details and playing time. However, these changes have helped encourage new players to join the team and have helped the Harvard team’s overall game results.
“[The] varsity transition means we have more access to practice resources, we get more field time…full-time coaches, and more medical treatment,” Brown said. “This is the first year we’ve won an Ivy Championships, and it’s also the first year we’ve beaten Brown and Princeton in quite some time.”
The transition has not only helped the Radcliffe women gain more resources, but has also given the men’s team more to work with as well.
“We see advancing women’s rugby and advancing men’s rugby as totally compatible,” Brown said. “[They] have more access to some of these resources than they have [in the past]. We’ve spent a lot of time discussing with the Athletic Department what the needs of a rugby team are in terms of injury prevention and training and weight lifting. That is not something that either of our teams had three years ago.”
While both teams have seen benefits from the women’s transition to varisty, there are also NCAA compliance restrictions that have made the women’s adjustment more difficult in some respects. According to NCAA rules, new players are required to go to UHS and undergo a complete physical, EKG, and full-impact concussion test—regardless of whether they will be playing a position requiring it—before they get cleared to play. The lengthy process is a detractor for potential new recruits.
“As a club spor, we had a bit more flexibility to choose ourselves what we wanted to do,” Brown said. “One huge unanticipated disadvantage of being varsity is the extent to which the NCAA compliance stuff has made it harder to bring new people on to the team.”
In terms of recruiting, club sports have a disadvantage because there are no preferred admissions for rugby recruits. Nevertheless, both teams have had an increase in new players year by year. The Crimson men’s team has a membership this year of over 50 players.
“All the recruiting is done when students get on campus,” Kiechle said. “We actually have a position on the board dealing specifically with recruiting. We go to the activities fairs, hand out fliers…and we have no cuts. So if you want to play rugby, you can play rugby.”
First founded in 1872, the Harvard Rugby Club has become the largest club on campus and has won two Ivy League Championship titles in the past decade. This success is in part attributable to the large network of alumni support for the Crimson men’s players.
“We’re very fortunate,” Kiechle said. “We have a lot of active alums who come to our games, who support us financially to some regard, and who advise us on rugby decisions about coaching. They’re there every step of the way, really.”
As the women’s team continues to see results from its club-to-varsity switch, the men’s team is content with remaining a club sport, and the team has been successful this fall.
“We’ve been doing really well,” Kiechle said. “The past fall we’ve had a record of 6-2 and the two losses came from Dartmouth, who has been a powerhouse this year. We’ll be playing Cornell in March, and if we win that we’ll be going on to the Ivy Championship.”
The Harvard Rugby Club continues to grow and succeed as a club team. The women’s team advances as a varsity sport have only helped the men’s team in the publicity and recognition of rugby as an increasingly popular sport.
“I think we’ve explored all of our options in the past,” Kiechle said. “We really like where we’re at right now. We have a strong support from a pretty large alumni network, we have a great relationship with the athletics department, and with the newly varsity women’s team.”

Harvard may have met its match. In a segment that aired earlier this week on "The Colbert Report," Stephen Colbert commented on the fact that 23,000 people applied for 600 jobs at two recently-opened Walmart stores, giving Walmart a frighteningly low acceptance rate of 2.6 percent. 
Colbert put it best when he warned applicants to Harvard and Princeton that they may be aiming too low. "It turns out," he said, "there's now an even more elite institution on the scene."
This news is obviously distressing for current students at Harvard (it really has been a tough week), but is likely even more distressing for the Harvard Admissions Office, which just sent out early action decisions to prospective members of the Class of 2018.
 
Walmart poses a unique threat to Harvard because it has come out of nowhere in the selective admissions game. Unlike Yale and Princeton, which Harvard competes against every year, Walmart has flown under the radar and has now made an entrance unlike anything the Harvard admissions team has ever seen.
 
The effects of this are still unclear. On one hand, some high school seniors will be more drawn to Walmart now that is has established the lure of exclusivity. On the other hand, Harvard may benefit from the rebound of this news, as students may be less intimidated to apply to the second most exclusive institution in the country.
Walmart also lacks an early action program, which seems to be working in the short run—but may not be to its advantage in the long run.
 
To students at Harvard: it may be hard to accept, but we’re no longer at the most exclusive place in the universe. This is going to be hard, but we’re going to fight through this and come back strong next year. 
 And finally, to all those worried about this increase in selectivity across the board, Stephen Colbert had it right: there’s always that safety school Yale.

Nerdy in the best way possible, graduates over at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Dental School recently parodied the popular song “The Fox” by Norwegian comedy duo Ylvis. In their rendition, “The Spleen,” students at the Medical School ask the age-old question: what does the spleen do? Is it a back up tongue? A third eye? The world may never know. The video was created for The 107th Annual Second Year Show by the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Dental Medicine class of 2016. The parody quickly went viral after it was posted to Youtube on December 8. Since then, it has reached over 1 million views in just five days. Another notable parody made this year by Harvard Medical School students is “The Gunner Song,” a spoof of Macklemore’s “Thrift Shop” that satirizes the stressful and overachieving lives of Med students. The class of 2014 did their own spoof for the Second Year Show two years ago with “Piss in My Pants,” a parody of Lonely Island’s “Jizz in My Pants.” We still may not know what the spleen does, but we do know that Med students can have some fun, too!

For students bogged down by studying for exams and local residents braving the bitter December air, Shake Shack has a cup of bittersweet hot chocolate ready to warm you up.
 While the highly anticipated arrival of Shake Shack in Harvard Square is still several weeks away, fans of the burger franchise can satisfy their current cravings tomorrow, as Shake Shack will be giving away free cups of house-made Dark Hot Chocolate from noon to 5 p.m. in their future location at 92 Winthrop Street.
 "We think this will be an awesome way for us to connect with the local community and let everyone know we’re on the way," wrote Greg Waters, Senior Manager of Marketing and Communications for Shake Shack, in an email to The Crimson.
 Although the restaurant was originally expected to open this month, Waters wrote that an official date has yet to be finalized and predicted that Shake Shack will likely open its doors the first week of January.
