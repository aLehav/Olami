After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pair of Harvard divers competed in this weekend’s NCAA Zone A Diving Championships, eyeing berths to the 2013 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships. Sophomore Michael Mosca earned his first trip to the national championships, while senior Brittany Powell had a personal-best performance at the event to close out her Crimson career.
With a second-place finish in the one-meter, Mosca became the first Harvard diver since 2003 to punch his ticket to the NCAA Championships.
“I’m excited to find out [what I can do at NCAA’s],” Mosca said. “I would love to beat my best, so I can get points for my team. I think it’s great to be able to compete on the national level for Harvard men’s swimming and diving. There’s going to be a bunch of swimmers from our team, so it will be a great experience to dive alongside those swimmers.”
Last season, Mosca just missed qualifying for the NCAA Championships. He finished in second on the one-meter and third on the three-meter in his freshman debut at Zones.
“This year I have brand new dives I have added into my competitive list, both on one-meter and three-meter,” Mosca said. “Now I have a higher degree of difficulty, which means I can score more points. I think that was a huge contributing factor to my ability to actually qualify. I’ve got a much more competitive list, and I have had another year to polish up my dives.”
Mosca had a strong performance in the one-meter preliminaries on Friday to kick-off the event. His total of 329.55 put him solidly in fourth heading into the finals. Mosca then leapfrogged two of his competitors with his 677.60 point total, good for second place.
On Saturday, Mosca sat in third after the three-meter prelims with a 382.75 point total. In the finals, he racked up 373.75 points to finish in fourth.
Last weekend, Mosca swept both the one-meter and three-meter events to take home two titles at the Ivy League Championships. The sophomore was named the Karl B. Michael High Point Diver of the meet. Earlier this season, Mosca broke his own school records in both events at the Brown dual meet in January.
For Powell, it was a fitting end to her senior season. Her strong performances in both events capped her Crimson career.
“I made a goal before the meet,” Powell said. “It wasn’t a huge pressure situation, because I never really thought I would necessarily get top two or make it to NCAA’s, but I wanted to final on both boards and make top-18.”
Powell competed in Zones both her freshman and sophomore years, but missed out on the Championships last season. She had only reached the finals once: in three-meter during her sophomore season.
This year, in her final time out representing Harvard, Powell qualified for the finals on both boards. Her prelim score of 253.55 on Friday was good enough to make the top-18 in the three-meter, and her final score of 236.55 gave the senior a 15th place finish in the event. Powell posted an identical 15th place finish on the three-meter, with a prelim score of 227.10 and a finals score of 228.30.
“It’s great to see an evolution in your diving, and to be able to set goals like that and achieve them,” Powell said. “It was a great end to my career.”
Powell led the women’s team both in and out of the pool after having been elected co-captain last spring.
“I really put all the pressure of my last season into being a great captain rather than focusing on my individual performance,” Powell said. “I think the mentality of being a good role model—doing all the dry-lands, all those extra little things—definitely helped my own personal diving.”
At the Ivy League Championships in late February, Powell captured her first league title with a win on the one-meter board. She also took home a second-place finish in the three-meter dive.
“It really ended on a fairytale note for me,” Powell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say everything is bigger in Texas, and unfortunately for the Harvard baseball team this past weekend, that meant its deficits were as well.
The Crimson (1-9) continued to struggle early in the season and was swept by No. 27 Rice (14-7), which outscored Harvard 26-4 over the course of the three-game series.
“We didn’t make many plays, we didn’t make many pitches,” sophomore outfielder Mike Martin said. “To sum it up, we didn’t do anything right.”
RICE 12, HARVARD 0
The Owls handed the Crimson its ninth-straight loss Sunday afternoon with a dominant performance.
Kevin McCanna, Connor Mason, and Evan Rutter limited Harvard to one hit—a Mitch Klug second-inning single—while the Owls scored three runs in each of the first two innings to jump on Crimson freshman starter Sean Poppen.
In the opening frame, Rice took advantage of a two-out error on sophomore third baseman Nick Saathoff that opened the door for three runs. With runners on first and third, Keenan Cook singled home one, and Michael Aquino then ripped a triple into the left field corner to bring home two more.
In the following inning, Ford Stainback singled off Poppen with the bases loaded to drive in two, and a sacrifice fly plated another for the Owls.
After Rice loaded the bases again in the bottom of the sixth, Harvard manager Bill Decker pulled Poppen in favor of freshman Shaun Rubin. Rubin allowed a single to left by Leon Byrd, scoring one, and following a sacrifice fly by Ford Stainback, Cook’s two-out RBI triple scored three more and pushed the lead to 11-0. In the following inning, a double, wild pitch, and Michael Ratterree RBI single added the 12th run.
“They hit in key situations, they played great defense, [and] their pitchers threw strikes—a lot of things we need to do better,” senior infielder Robert Wineski said.
RICE 9, HARVARD 2
The Owls’ bats also got going early on Saturday. The squad scored five runs against junior starter Peter Kaplan, who failed to escape the first inning.
Byrd walked and stole second, and then Stainback singled and did the same. With two runners in scoring position, Christian Stringer ripped a triple down the right field line to plate both, and Connor Teyki’s single through the left side brought Stringer home.
Teyki was thrown out trying to steal, but two more singles and a hit-by-pitch loaded the bases for the Eagles. Kaplan then drilled Skyler Ewing, and his replacement, freshman Matt Sanders, walked Byrd to give Rice its fifth run.
With two outs in the following inning, Cook singled, stole second, and scored on an Aquino single to make it 6-0.
“It’s hard to take anything [positive] out of a game when you’re down 10-0 or 6-0 right off the bat,” Martin said.
Harvard finally got something going offensively in the top of the sixth. Martin led off with an infield single and was replaced with freshman pinch runner T.J. Laurisch. Sophomore  Brandon Kregel then singled to left, classmate Ethan Ferreira walked, and Laurisch scored on a fielders choice to give Harvard its first run. But Klug flied out to center and sophomore Tanner Anderson struck out to end the rally.
Rice scored again in the bottom of the inning on doubles by Stainback and Teyki—who like Aquino went three-for-four—before Saathoff had a two-out RBI single to left to score junior Carlton Bailey in the bottom of the inning.
But Rice pushed its lead to 10 by adding two more runs on fielders choices in the seventh and eighth. Jordan Stephens struck out eight over seven innings for the Owls, who recorded 13 hits on the afternoon.
“They’re putting the ball in play, and they’re getting doubles and triples, and the pitchers are just able to throw strikes,” Martin said. “Its so much easier to play when you’re ahead and so much harder to play when you’re down.”
RICE 5, HARVARD 2
In the closest game of the series, it was the third inning that proved to be the difference, as the Owls rallied for four runs—all unearned—off of Crimson junior starter Sam Dodge.
With the bases loaded and two out, Saathoff misplayed a ground ball, allowing Rice’s first two runs to cross the plate. Dodge then hit Stringer with a pitch to load the bases again and Tyrek singled through the left side to score two more before Dodge escaped the bases-loaded jam by getting Cook to fly out to center.
In the following inning, Rice loaded the bases again, and Aquino singled home a run before Dodge stranded three more by getting Stringer to pop out.
Dodge, freshman Joey Silepka, and classmate Sean O’Neill held the Owls scoreless the rest of the way, and Harvard made it interesting in the final two innings.
In the top of the eighth, Wineski walked, Martin singled to right, and Kregel singled to right center to load the bases with no outs. After Ferreira struck out, freshman D.J. Link reached on a Teyki error, giving the Crimson its first run of the series. But Zech Lemond entered in relief of Austin Kubitza—who had struck out eight over seven innings—and immediately whiffed Saathoff and Klug to end the threat.
After O’Neill escaped a bases-loaded jam in the top of the ninth, another Rice error in the bottom of the frame scored freshman Michael Loughlin to make it 5-2. But Ferreira struck out swinging as the tying run, and Rice took the win.
“We just didn’t make plays when we had to,” Martin said. “We’re just literally not making any plays at all, offensively and defensively.”
Wineski was a bit more optimistic about the team’s performance.
“[This series] really shows what we strive for, what we need to work on,” he said. “[But] we’re a young team, so I think we’ll learn.... I think the team’s going to really pull together and get better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before the Harvard men’s basketball team’s Thursday night matchup with the University of New Mexico in the second round of the NCAA tournament, we caught up with J.R. Oppenheim of the New Mexico Daily Lobo to learn more about the Crimson’s opponent.
THC: What should Harvard expect from UNM? What are the team's strengths and weaknesses?
Without a doubt, New Mexico is a strong defensive unit, particularly in the half-court. Coach Steve Alford does not like to run a full-court press defense, so don’t expect to see that kind of tempo. His offensive philosophy works the ball from the inside out. Sophomore center Alex Kirk, a 7-foot Los Alamos, N.M. product, returned to the roster this year after back surgery for a herniated disc sidelined him a year ago, and he’s been one of the most consistent threats on the Lobo team. Australian sophomore forward Cameron Bairstow has come on lately as players key in on Kirk in the low post, and he earned all-conference honors last week. UNM will establish that frontcourt presence early in contests then start kicking the ball outside to its guards—juniors Kendall Williams and Tony Snell, and sophomore Hugh Greenwood. All three guards can shoot from the perimeter, especially Snell. Kirk is also capable of draining shots from beyond the arc. UNM does not have a senior on this current starting lineup, but senior forward Chad Adams provides strong defense off the bench and quick senior guard Jamal Fenton adds a different type energy whenever he’s on the floor. Freshman Cleveland “Pancake” Thomas has performed well off the bench over the last few weeks.
THC: What did South Dakota State, Saint Louis, UNLV, SDSU, and Air Force do to beat UNM?
In regards to Air Force, it's just one of those games that came down to the wire, a last-second Air Force triple. It was bit of an anomaly compared to the other losses since it was such a high-scoring affair. Since New Mexico has not been a particularly strong shooting team, those other teams took advantage of that defensively. San Diego State limited UNM to 25 percent shooting, the school’s lowest mark in the shot-clock era. That was the only game New Mexico wasn’t in. Nearly every Lobo game this season, win or loss, has been close. New Mexico is phenomenal in the last five to 10 minutes, especially on defense. In the losses to South Dakota State, UNLV and Saint Louis, the defense did not come through quite as well as it did in UNM’s closer wins.
THC: Could you talk about Tony Snell's performance to close out the season? What makes him effective?
Tony Snell has always been capable of being “the guy” for UNM. He’s a consistent double-digit scorer and his defense has improved over the season, but I’ve only seen a handful of games where he’s just gone off offensively. Since March began, he’s simply taken his game to another level. He easily won the MWC tournament MVP award after he had dominated games against San Diego State and UNLV. Against the Aztecs, Snell had a stretch of three 3-pointers on consecutive trips to lead a second-half charge. In the second half of Saturday’s championship, he had a personal 11-2 run against UNLV to break open a close game. The confidence he’s gained by his improved defense has translated to an overall higher confidence level as a player. The “Silent Assassin,” as he’s called, is not the most talkative guy, but when he’s on his game, he’s a force to be reckoned with.
THC: What has been the reaction from UNM players, coaches, and fans to being matched up against Harvard?
UNM’s official company line, like many teams have, is ‘Take it one game at a time,’ so they’re not looking past Harvard. However, I have not had an opportunity to talk with Coach Alford or the players about their scouting report. By the way it sounds, the fans feel pretty confident about the matchup.
THC: What did the Lobos learn from their two tournament games last year?
I can’t attest to what the team has learned from last year’s tournament since this is my first season on the beat, but I can tell you this team is different from past Lobo squads based on the fact that a different player can step up at any time. Last year, Drew Gordon was the clearly top player on UNM’s roster. This year, Snell can step up big when needed. Williams scored 46 against Colorado State, but UNM is nearly unbeatable when he has at least five assists. Greenwood’s 3-point shooting was key in UNM’s overtime win at Indiana State. Some nights Kirk is better down low. Some nights it’s Bairstow. Sometimes it’s both. It’s an extremely unselfish group. When you play New Mexico, you really have to pick your poison because if you key in too much on one guy, there are four others who can beat you.
THC: Does this team have a chip on its shoulder about its seeding? Does it believe it was disrespected by the selection committee?
The team does not appear to be disappointed in a No. 3 seed. I wrote a column saying I believed UNM would get a No. 2 seed, but that came prior to the Lobos’ season-finale loss to Air Force. Obviously fans want a higher seed, but if you look at who the No. 1 seeds are (Louisville, Gonzaga, Kansas and Indiana) and who the No. 2 seeds are (Ohio State, Miami, Georgetown and Duke), it’s not that surprising that UNM received a third seed despite their high RPI and strength of schedule. I feel those one or two seeds are so hard to come by, it’s difficult to be too disappointed in a No. 3 seed. If you look at the bracket, Gonzaga and New Mexico are the only two teams outside the traditional “power” conferences to be seeded third or higher. Of course the team members have been saying they want to go as far into the tournament as they possibly can, but the bigger concern around the community is at least breaking through into the Sweet 16. UNM has made 13 appearances in the Big Dance, and never progressed past the round of 32, not even when they were a No. 3 seed in 2010. That’s the hurdle New Mexico needs to clear if it wants to gain more exposure on the national level.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opening the 2012-2013 basketball season, Harvard’s success depended almost entirely on wing Wes Saunders and point guard Siyani Chambers. The sophomore-freshman duo came out hot, with Chambers’s vision and distribution complimenting Saunders’s speed off the dribble and ability to finish in the paint.
For a team with no clear identity after the loss of co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, the Saunders-Chambers combo seemed like the Crimson’s best shot to do offensive damage at the beginning of the season.
However, early non-conference losses highlighted Harvard’s weakness in the paint, and strong interior players like Connecticut forward DeAndre Daniels exploited the Crimson’s relative lack of size and strength. With no established power forward—let alone center—and a tough non-conference schedule ahead, the young team struggled to find its rhythm and spell Saunders, who was limited on offense when he was tasked with defending the opponent’s strongest scoring threat.
Then came the bigs.
The evolution of sophomore forwards Jonah Travis, Kenyatta Smith and Steve Mondou-Missi—who all averaged fewer than 14 minutes per game as freshmen—has been key to the Crimson’s late-season success. Though the three have developed distinct roles and identities, their playing time has been inexorably linked to each other’s success in a lineup that tends to employ four perimeter players, leaving space for one inside presence.
Heating up at different times and in key situations throughout the season, the trio has combined to hand the Crimson some of its most important wins—and will be even more crucial when Harvard takes on New Mexico in the NCAA tournament.
“[The Lobos] are big and that’s the thing,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said, after learning about the matchup on Selection Sunday. “They are a big, strong and powerful team. Their guards have size, and you are looing at six-seven on the perimeter.”
The Lobos favored starting lineup includes seven-foot center Alex Kirk and a backcourt that ranges from 6’3” to 6’7”.
Throughout the season, the Crimson has struggled to contain tall teams like New Mexico, but if there’s hope for Harvard, it lies with the bigs and their development through Amaker’s season long search for a consistent post presence.
Moundou-Missi came into the season with the most experience of the three—averaging five points in 14 minutes per game as a freshman—and was thrust into a starting role at the beginning of the year, starting the first five games. But, foul trouble plagued the forward and limited his effectiveness as it forced him to play conservatively.
Moundou-Missi fouled out after only 11 minutes in the Crimson’s win over Manhattan and racked up four personals in two of his other four starts. After failing to make the impact Amaker was looking for, Moundou-Missi went to the bench, where he was able to make a bigger impact, scoring in double digits in half of Harvard’s conference contests—including a 17-point night at Yale.
However, as chants of “Steeeeeeve” began to fill Lavietes, Moundou-Missi had one more hurdle to overcome—his free throw shooting.
During Harvard’s first Ivy home stand, the forward went eight for 18 at the stripe, missing key opportunities down the stretch in close wins over Brown and Yale. But Moundou-Missi adapted, and never shot below 75 percent from the line for the rest of the season.
Like Moundou-Missi, Smith started the first fives games but quickly took a secondary role after struggling to finish in the paint. Smith waited in the wings for the majority of the season, averaging 14 minutes per game, until Amaker put him back in the lineup for the Penn-Princeton homestand.
Smith’s breakout weekend could not have come at a better time for the Crimson. Having dropped a road contest to Columbia, the matchups against the Killer P’s were must wins at home if Harvard were to remain in contention for the title.
Smith put up a career-high 20 points against Penn on Friday and was one rebound away from a triple-double, adding 10 blocks. On Saturday, the forward followed it up with 14 points on 100 percent shooting from both the field and the line, while notching six blocks to boot. At 6’8”—the tallest of the three—Smith leads the Crimson with 2.2 blocked shots per game, and his performances against Penn and Princeton earned him the start for the remainder of the regular season.
When Smith and Moundou-Missi went to the bench after the first five games of the season, Amaker turned to Travis, who started in 14 straight games in a hot mid-season stretch. The forward came out firing in the season opener against MIT—putting up 14 points in 21 minutes—and a 16 point performance against Fordham earned him his first career start in the Crimson’s next contest at Boston College.
However, Travis’ season has been marked by inconsistency. His season-high 19 points against Saint Mary’s came late in non-conference play, and since a 16-point performance in the Crimson’s Ivy home opener Travis has not scored in double digits again. As conference play has progressed and Smith and Moundou-Missi have heated up, Travis has seen progressively less playing time, sitting out the final game of the season.
Going into Thursday’s matchup, it remains to be seen which lineup Amaker chooses. Taking a page from the start of the season, he could choose to tap Smith and Moundou-Missi in an attempt to get as much size on the court as possible. However, its more likely he will go with the four-guard combination of Chambers, Saunders, and co-captains Christian Webster and Laurent Rivard that has become the Crimson’s offensive identity this season, using his trio of bigs in rotation.
Regardless of the lineup Amaker chooses on Thursday, Travis, Smith, and Moundou-Missi face a tall task ahead.
