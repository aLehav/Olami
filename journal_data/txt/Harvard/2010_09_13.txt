After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cornell University’s administration recently mandated that Greek organizations on campus adhere to regulations that strictly limit alcohol consumption and prohibit freshmen from attending Greek parties where alcohol is served. Though well-intentioned, the rules are not an effective way of addressing alcohol problems within fraternities and sororities. Instead, they incentivize drinking in secret and in potentially more hazardous environments, where underage drinkers and their peers may not be able to look out for one another, putting lives in danger. However, despite these undesirable rules, Greek organizations at Cornell and elsewhere do have a responsibility to re-define their culture so that it emphasizes more than just imbibing.
Prohibiting freshmen from attending fraternity or sorority parties not only restricts those freshmen who do drink, but also punishes freshmen who simply want to socialize without drinking alcohol. The administrative action cuts off what likely serves as the main social outlet for many freshmen. It provides them with no alternative, putting a damper on their social lives even if they are looking to have fun while staying sober. These rules are unfair to the freshmen who committed no legal offense to begin with.
The most pressing issue regarding drinking that must be addressed, however, is hazing. While drinking to be initiated into an organization is part of a long-standing tradition in many fraternities and sororities, forced consumption of alcohol is unacceptable because it endangers the lives of students. This is a risk no organization should be willing to take, and it is understandable that Cornell’s administration felt compelled to implement these rules to deal with such safety issues. However, these problems can and should be addressed in a different manner, one that does not force underage drinkers to turn to unsound alternatives.
Even Harvard’s final club culture is a standing example of how prohibitive rules can backfire. Barring male freshmen from final club parties often leads to high-volume binge drinking in their own dorm rooms or elsewhere; the record number of freshmen admitted to Harvard University Health Services last year for alcohol intoxication or poisoning might be evidence of this. The rules—while not mandated by the university in Harvard’s case—prompt underground action that may be preventable under monitored circumstances.
But, although less than ideal, the new regulations can certainly motivate fraternities and sororities to retool their images into something more meaningful than the drinking culture that currently seems to define them. Drinking should neither be the foundation for these organizations’ reputations nor the sole draw for joining them. It would be in the groups’ best interests to ensure that existing or potential members have something to look forward to—and to take pride in—other than the copious amounts of alcohol consumption for which fraternities and sororities are generally known.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I received the email with great anxiety. “UPDATE: SPU 27-Science and Cooking Lecture Sept. 7,” the subject line read. Hooray, an update! Finally.
My excitement was, however, unjustified. The email wasn’t much of an update at all. I didn’t receive any information about my status in Science of the Physical Universe 27, “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter,” Harvard’s most hyped science course, even though it was the penultimate day of shopping period.
The email, from the Program in General Education, instead emphasized that attendance in the main hall for the day’s lecture would be capped at 350, lest we commit a fire code violation. It was a gentle reminder to the aspiring chefs: If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen. Students could not leave early; the class was not meant for shopping. Wait, really? Then, why didn’t we know yet whether we’d received a spot in the course?
This email exemplifies a troubling flaw in Harvard’s shopping week. For sure, there is much to applaud about this period. Giving students the flexibility to try-before-they-buy allows them to tailor schedules to interests. However, the uncertainty of shopping week is exciting only in the opportunity to choose from the courses in which we have the option to enroll—not in the stress that many students endure as they await lottery results for certain courses. To reduce this externally imposed anxiety, all instructors should lottery courses after the first class period.
Shopping week inevitably induces stress. Most obviously, students weigh the opportunity costs of various schedules. They don’t want to buy course materials and start studying until they’ve confirmed their courses, but they can’t start work until they’ve done so. They must plan their textbook purchases and work schedules carefully, especially since the COOP has a small window for returning textbooks, and hours of reading put into a class are non-refundable. It can be a nerve-wracking process.
Thus, late lotteries heighten anxiety in an already hectic week. For classes as popular as “Science and Cooking” and the other myriad courses with insufficient spots for students—such as “The American Presidency” and many concentration tutorials—instructors should hold lotteries within one day of the first session. Such a short window of time may, unfortunately, exclude certain students who don’t know about a course. To include as many of those students as possible, all lotteries should be available online until the night after the first class meeting. But despite any potential drawbacks, an early-lottery system will enable students seeking spots in popular courses to know where they stand early in the week. They will be able to cross one anxiety off their first-week-of-school to-do list.
There will be outliers—those who are accepted to a course but realize they are unable to take it, or those who learn about a class after the lottery occurred. In those cases, there can be, as there often is, a waiting list. But, under the current lottery system, everybody who enters a lottery is effectively on a waiting list, and it’s a tense experience for these students.
As students, we know that we will probably be one week behind in our homework once shopping week is over. It’s a stress we are willing to accept for the opportunity to craft an enriching schedule. But, some of the other stresses are unnecessary. Classes that hold late lotteries? They’re damaged goods, and it’s time students demand a refund.

Stephanie Wilson ’88 will be one of the last Harvard graduates to fly on a space shuttle and will thus be one of the last to vividly recount the wonder and mystique of her space flight experience. When the former engineering concentrator from Currier House travelled aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery back in 2006, she was regarded with pride by the Harvard community—her mission would bring“great credit” to the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, as former Dean Venkatesh Narayanamurti said in a Harvard Crimson news article reporting the mission.
Earlier this year, President Barack H. Obama cancelled the National Aeronautics & Space Administration Constellation program, which effectively eliminates the human spaceflight initiative. In a statement explaining the decision and fiscal goals for NASA, there is an emphasis on other NASA programs that promote “robotic space exploration, science and Earth observations.” In substantiating the plan to eliminate the Constellation program, it is also stated that “NASA’s program to repeat many of the achievements of the Apollo era is the least attractive approach to space exploration as compared to potential alternatives.” While there is validity in bolstering other NASA programming in this new budget proposal, this also dictates an end to NASA’s return mission to the moon and the slow demise of our nation’s human spaceflight program—an initiative which has established America’s global leadership in space technology to other nations.
The Constellation Program was inherently rife with intangible assets that have strengthened our nation and continue to fortify our goals, and there should have been a greater focus on this program’s development. NASA mission and vision statements to find life beyond, explore the universe, and inspire the next generation of explorers are significantly debilitated by the drastic changes proposed by the new plan. The elimination of this program erases the achievements of those brave visionaries who have expanded human knowledge, revolutionized scientific understanding, and have produced advancements that have benefited all humanity. Harvard University, in a parallel academic mission statement, honors an exploration of the unknown so that students may “rejoice in discovery” and feel liberated by education “to explore, to create to challenge, and to lead.” In maintaining such a congruent purpose, to encourage the achievement of unimaginable feats, and to discover and adapt to evolving technologies in society, Harvard University should support NASA astronauts in their push to encourage Obama to reconsider the new space policy.
As former President George W. Bush asserted in a 2003 address at the NASA Headquarters, “America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons. We have undertaken space travel because the desire to explore and understand is part of our character.”
While I acknowledge the immediate fiscal returns this budget generates, providing NASA with $100 billion over the 2011 through 2015 fiscal years, this proposal would further dismantle and eventually bury what remains of the human spaceflight initiative—a cornerstone of national pride, novel American discovery, and scientific inspiration. Proposed budget increases are also deemed to be less than the $3-billion-a-year increase that a blue-ribbon committee appointed by the Obama administration said was needed for NASA to successfully pursue a human spaceflight program beyond low-Earth orbit. Considering these factors, it is debatable whether this plan is even significantly cheaper or faster than further investment into manned spaceflight technology. More importantly, this program has proven to surpass fiscal limitations in a tremendous display of awe-inspiring exploration and discovery in unknown territory. America has established its preeminence, ambitious leadership, and quest for discovery within the opportunities set forth by the NASA Constellation Program. It is precisely this same thirst for human knowledge, acceptance of challenge with unwavering dedication, and pursuit of excellence that Harvard strives to impart within the mindset of its students.
Cancelling NASA’s human space operations hampers efforts to continue advancing at the frontier of human space exploration, develop technology, and set the standards of excellence that will enable further space ventures to eventually succeed. Likewise, the elimination of the Constellation Program could limit future generations’ abilities to achieve space flight. Students will no longer be able to say “I want to be an astronaut when I grow up” with the same starry-eyed vision of walking on the moon. With such parallel goals, Harvard University should stand by NASA astronauts and advocate for the Constellation Program, thus encouraging the Obama administration to continue funding it. After all, there is bound to be another Harvard student dreaming of the same aspiration Stephanie Wilson was able to realize.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I would love to be able to pick and choose which of my actions bear responsibility—or have the world only acknowledge my better choices. Unfortunately, none of us have that power. World leaders, however, at least possess the ability to influence the globe positively enough to at least minimize the regrettable deeds of yesterday, as we should prepare to observe in the final act of former Cuban President Fidel Castro’s life.
Castro is back in the public eye, and he apparently has just discovered the Internet in his absence. Speaking to The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg in a series of interviews and then Mexico’s La Jornada, Castro has seemingly reinvented himself as an old, ailing man with new, healthy opinions.
The 24-hour news cycle has recycled his views on Israel and Iran, as related by Goldberg, in a sort of media death grip. And it is indeed significant that Castro publicly admonished Iran and its president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for denying the Holocaust. Fidel appears to defend strongly Israel’s right to exist, while empathizing with the worldview that a legacy of persecution can produce. In so doing, Castro distanced himself from Venezuela’s outspoken President Hugo Chavez, who as a socialist and American detractor has positioned his country with Cuba on many occasions. Unlike Castro, Chavez has sought the spotlight for his opinions while still in office, a policy I deplored in The Crimson last winter.
In his views on a possible showdown between Israel and Iran (I should note that these interviews were inspired by Goldberg’s controversial feature on the subject), Castro has carved out his own position, one based on unique life experience. No one alive today can say he was a leader as critically involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example—and those tense days in 1962 have, at long last, inspired Castro to stand up for global nuclear disarmament.
The reborn Castro, speaking to Goldberg, admitted that he was wrong to advocate the Soviet use of nuclear weapons against America during the crisis. Expect to hear more from Castro in future interviews along the theme of the threat of nuclear weapons and the need for disarmament. Unlike in 1962, the men in charge of the two main nuclear arsenals—President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev (whether in his own right or as chief puppet of Vladimir Putin)—seem to also approve of gradual disarmament and signed a new treaty to reduce their nations’ nuclear arsenals in April. Yet even with their support, disarmament remains an abstract, far-off possibility. Any efforts by Castro to raise awareness, or to reach out to states traditionally less aligned with the United States than with, say, Cuba, will be welcome in that fight.
Castro’s legacy as the long-time leader of Cuba cannot be erased by such advocacy, and many of his actions are indefensible. The arrests, rapes, and fear that characterized his regime can never be adequately explained, much less forgiven. Yet when Castro apologized for his regime’s treatment of the island’s gay community, telling La Jornada, “If someone is responsible, it’s me,” he showed that he at least recognizes his personal involvement and error.
Remorse from Castro, following a near-death experience, may seem scant comfort to those who endured the hardships of his rule. Those who reply, as I have read on message boards and in the political blogosphere, that Castro’s admission was “too little, too late,” do so with justification. But they miss the bigger possibility here, that Castro’s about-face on some issues can have a very real and immediate impact on the lives of Cubans and others.
When Castro acknowledges gay rights, or takes the head of Havana’s Jewish community on his trip with Goldberg to see the dolphin show at the Havana aquarium (where the director is a nuclear physicist and the veterinarians include Che Guevara’s daughter), he lays the groundwork for Cuba to move forward. He puts added pressure on Iran, a task that seems of growing importance with each day. Simply put, he puts his imprint on the public discourse in a positive way. People will listen to what Castro has to say.
They will not always believe him, or put credence in his positions. Just look at his claim that Osama bin Laden is a U.S.-planted spy. But he can add value even if we don’t agree with everything that Castro argues. Here’s an extreme example: Muammar al-Gaddafi, of Libya, operates in the realm of the outrageous and even demands random jihads, while introducing ideas worthy of serious consideration, such as a federally united Africa.
Early indications point to Castro’s ratio of good ideas and preposterous ones besting Gaddafi by a great deal, and Castro’s significantly unburdened by his own legacy. The day the leader of the revolution can admit that his revolutionary model no long works in Cuba, the world should notice Castro isn’t following business as usual. Let President Raul Castro try to fix the Cuban economy—his brother, the new, candid Castro, has set his sights on the world.

The Undergraduate Council will allocate a portion of its term-time student activities budget to funding student-initiated events occurring on campus during the last week of January Term, according to UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11.
In addition, University President Drew G. Faust announced last Thursday the creation of the President’s January Innovation Fund for Faculty, which will offer a limited number of grants to faculty in the development of “creative academic or co-curricular activities” during the upcoming J-Term.
The UC’s funding, which will be distributed on a rolling application basis, will be available to support a variety of student programming during the Optional Winter Activities Week, the last week of J-Term.
“Trainings and other normal student group operations are going to be a big area where we’re funding [during the week], but we definitely want to encourage new events too,” said UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11, citing informal, student-led classes as an example of a popular student proposal.
Although the UC’s budget has not been finalized. Bowman offered what he called a “really ballpark” estimate of $15,000. “We want to budget it as the busiest week we’ll have in the school year,” he said.
Though the UC is currently the only official source of funding for on-campus student activities during J-Term, Hysen said that off-campus student group-initiated programming during the Optional Winter Activities Week will be eligible for financial support from the newly renewed Student Life Fund, which funds domestic travel for student groups.
The President’s Innovation Fund will be based on a competitive application process open to faculty from all schools of the University, according to an announcement posted on Faust’s homepage. Any faculty programming proposals involving undergraduate participation must be limited to the duration of the Optional Winter Activities Period in order to be considered, according to the announcement. This year’s fund is being tested as a pilot program, and may be expanded in the future.
The College has chosen a new coordinator for the month-long J-Term, replacing former Interim Director of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer, who left for Dartmouth College.
Erin E. Goodman, the assistant director of the Office of International Programs, will serve in a coordinating role for the upcoming J-Term, according to Bowman.
Goodman is a member of a newly formed J-Term planning committee that also includes Associate Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin, Hysen, and UC representative Crystal D. Trejo ’13, Bowman said.
The committee has already met once this semester, and will continue to meet regularly to discuss this year’s J-Term.
“We are definitely working closely with the College to make sure this winter break is successful,” Hysen said.

Harvard University will not sell a portion of its real estate holdings to China’s sovereign wealth fund after efforts to broker a deal collapsed, according to a person familiar with the situation. Media reports estimated that the deal would have been worth several hundred million dollars.
Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s endowment, had been seeking to unload a portion of its real estate portfolio since February or before in order to improve liquidity, and the China Investment Corporation had been rumored as a potential buyer. The $300 billion state-owned fund has made several moves into the U.S. real estate market.
The University has declined to discuss the deal.
During the recent financial crisis, the endowment suffered losses of more than 50 percent on real estate in fiscal year 2009. That portion of the portfolio became difficult to convert to cash as many market players sought the security of more liquid investments.
But, with liquidity concerns largely addressed, Harvard endowment managers are now taking a second look at the sector and keeping holdings they once looked to sell.
While current investments in real estate have continued to perform poorly, HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo wrote in a report released last Thursday that HMC had started to hire new staff to add to the company’s real estate expertise while properties remain undervalued.
“Real estate is one of the areas we find most interesting in terms of current and future opportunities,” Mendillo wrote.
While the deal with CIC would have bolstered the endowment’s broader move towards increased liquidity, Mendillo has made other adjustments to the University’s portfolio that worked towards that end.
She has decreased HMC’s uncalled capital commitments, the amount of money pledged to external managers in the future, from $11 billion to $6.5 billion, a change that further increases fund liquidity.
After heavy losses in the 2009 fiscal year, Harvard’s endowment grew in value by 11 percent during the last fiscal year, according to Thursday’s report. But its real estate portfolio underperformed its benchmark last year. “Real assets,” including both real estate and natural resources, declined 2.7 percent for 2010. HMC does not publish numbers for real estate alone.

Enrollment in the introductory class Computer Science 50 jumped 56 percent from last year—from 337 students last fall to 525 this year. These enrollment numbers place CS50 as the fourth largest undergraduate class offered at the College.
Members of the CS50 staff attribute the sudden increase in enrollment to the scale of the annual CS50 student fair, during which students display their final projects from the class. They also point to the recent exposure of the class, such as through the Harvard Thinks Big event and the debate over the course staff’s attempts to offer it as SAT/UNSAT.
“Students talk about [CS50],” said course instructor David J. Malan ’99.
“Our last spring’s [SAT/UNSAT] endeavor did not end up changing the status quo but brought a very strong exposure to the class,” Malan added. “And at Harvard Thinks Big, we brought some great exposure to non-CS students about CS50.”
Course staff members say that those two examples are only a small part of Malan’s consistent, sweeping initiatives to make the course more visible on campus.
“Professor Malan has really helped to increase our presence on campus,” said Teaching Fellow Yuhki B. Yamashita ’11, an inactive Crimson editor. “And I think as a result of this increase, even more people will be interested in computer science and CS50.”
Between 2008 and 2009, the class only increased by what Yamashita called a “disappointing” seven students.
“So to see the course jump up so high in the number of students is kind of rewarding,” he said.
Some students currently enrolled in CS50 say that as a result of the way Malan markets the class, they have become more aware of the applicability of the class and of computer science as a discipline.
“You learn to solve problems more efficiently and effectively...it’s a marketable skill that a lot of Harvard students gravitate towards,” Daniel C. Norris ’12 said.
Although faced with an increase of nearly 200 students—evenly spread across the four undergraduate classes—Malan will not alter the lecturing dynamic of the class, according to CS50 teaching fellows.
“I don’t think that students will... get less out of lecture,” Yamashita said. “T-here might be more people, but it’s the same material.”
“A lecture is a lecture, whether there are 300 people or 500 people,” Norris said. “They might have to add more sections, but I think the experience will be the same.”

In a deviation from the norm across final clubs, the Bee Club is allowing friends of those selected to punch the all-female final club to also seek admission to the club.
An individual familiar with the Bee punch process said that the club’s invitations indicate that its punches—the undergraduates invited to seek membership in the Bee—are permitted to bring a friend to punch events.
Invitations were sent out last night.
Previously, only those directly invited could take part in the punch process, which in final clubs usually consists of dinners and various social engagements through which punched undergraduates meet club members, and members select which punches to admit into their club.
The Bee’s change in punch policy was made in order to address what the source, granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, characterized as imperfections of the punch process.
Under the prior system, since Bee members would hand-select individuals to punch for their club, they were limited to inviting only people they knew. Expanding the punch roster to include friends of those directly punched allows for more people—namely, those not directly connected to existing members—to be considered for the club.
Those who attend the punch events as a friend of an invited punch will be treated the same as the invited punch throughout the process, including in how the Bee selects the next class of members, according to the source. Only those organizing the punch will be able to distinguish between those who were invited by the club and those who were invited by a friend, the source said.
Undergraduate members of the Bee expressed near-unanimous approval of the change, the source added, refusing to discuss the opinions of the Bee’s graduate board, and without disclosing how many invitations were sent last night.
The Bee has not spoken to other final clubs about its new policy, the source said, though it hopes that other clubs consider adopting similar procedures in the future.
While a system that allows punches to invite friends to participate  in the process is a rarity among the final clubs, the Bee is not the  first social club to have made a move towards openness.
The Pleiades Society has used a system similar to the Bee's new  procedure ever since its inception in 2002, according to Mary E. Miller  '11, president of the all-female final club. The Seneca, an all-female  social organization, has an application that any sophomore, junior, or  senior woman can complete. And in February, the Hasty Pudding Club  stopped requiring an invite for its first spring membership event.
The individual familiar with the Bee punch process said that the Hasty Pudding’s experience with an open punch motivated the Bee to consider these changes more seriously. While the practices the Bee has adopted are still more stringent than those of the Hasty Pudding and the Seneca, the individual stressed that this move represents an attempt by the Bee to promote inclusivity in final club culture.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: September 13, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 13 news article "Bee Club Allows Friends of Invitees to Punch  Club" originally reported that the Bee was the first final club to  consider admitting students it did not directly select. In fact, the  Pleiades Society has used a policy similar to that of the Bee ever since  the final club was created, according to Pleiades President Mary E.  Miller '11.

Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren’s meeting with President Obama last week increased speculation as to whether she will be named head of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the new agency—created in July—charged with monitoring financial institutions and promoting consumer rights.
In a press conference last Friday, Obama said he had been in conversation with Warren, but added that he was not ready to make an appointment.
“The idea for this agency was Elizabeth Warren’s. She’s a dear friend of mine,” said Obama, who graduated from the Law School in 1991. “She is a tremendous advocate for this idea.”
Students at the Law School enrolled in Warren’s contracts class learned two weeks ago that she would not be teaching the course but received no explanation as to why. The news fueled rumors that Warren was poised to take the helm of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
But Warren is still currently slated to teach “Empirical Analysis of Law” with Professor Lynn M. LoPucki, according to a spokesperson at the Law School.
Over the past two years, Warren served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel, which implemented the Troubled Asset Relief Program, in which the federal government purchased assets and equity from banks to bolster the teetering financial sector.
Though favored by liberals, Warren is unpopular on Wall Street for her support of middle-class families vis-à-vis major financial institutions. Her appointment would likely spark a partisan debate and launch a daunting confirmation process.
“This is a big task standing up this entire agency, so I’ll have an announcement soon about how we’re going to move forward,” Obama said at last week’s press conference.

Law School Professor Gerald L. Neuman ’73 was elected last week to the Human Rights Committee, the United Nation’s body of independent experts that monitors civil and political rights.
Neuman said he does not have a particular issue he wants to focus on, but added that he hopes to help the Committee be more effective, to explain its decisions more clearly, and to encourage stricter compliance with international human rights standards.
“I am excited to have the opportunity to make a very concrete contribution to an institution that I have studied, have taught about, and have sometimes criticized the work of, and I hope to help to improve its work in the future,” Neuman said.
Neuman’s work has focused on international human rights law and comparative constitutional law.
He has written dozens of articles on national and international human rights issues, and published a book in 1996 entitled “Strangers to the Constitution: Immigrants, Borders, and Fundamental Law.”
Neuman has also written amicus briefs for Guantanamo detainee cases in 2004 and 2008. He has served on the faculty advisory committee of the Law School’s Human Rights Program.
“[Neuman is] an outstanding legal scholar with a focus on constitutional and human rights law and who has demonstrated his commitment to international human rights,” said James L. Cavallaro ’84, the Executive Director of the Human Rights Program.
“I am very happy and proud that he is the United States’ representative to the Human Rights Committee.”
The Committee consists of 18 members, each from a different country, elected for a term of four years. The Committee is responsible for overseeing States’ implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Though an extensive legal background is not required for the position, the Committee is responsible for interpreting and monitoring compliance with international human rights treaties, for which an understanding of the law and legal analysis is necessary, according to Cavallaro. The representatives to the Committee from the U.S. and the U.K. historically have been lawyers and law professors who have a deep understanding of and engagement with human rights law.
“Gerry Neuman has not only deep expertise in international human rights law, but also superb judgment, an impeccable sense of fairness, and remarkable powers of analysis,” said Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in a press release last week.
“This is a terrific appointment for the Human Rights Committee—and a very proud moment for Harvard Law School,” her statement continued.
Cavallaro said he expects Neuman will exceed the Committee’s high expectations for technical work, which includes evaluating cases and reviewing reports. Neuman will also bring nuance to understanding human rights abuses, Cavallaro added.
“He will make sure that the Committee is first rate in its legal analysis and factual understanding,” Cavallaro said.
Members of the Human Rights Committee are nominated by their respective countries, but they act as independent experts in their work on the Committee.
Last May, Neuman learned of his nomination, which the State Department oversaw. The formal election process took place on Sept. 2.
Neuman is on a research leave this semester, but he is slated to teach a constitutional law course and a human rights reading seminar this spring. Neuman said his new responsibilities with the Committee will not interfere with his teaching or work at the Law School.
In the 1980s, Neuman worked on issues regarding individual rights in the United States. Neuman became increasingly interested in international human rights law in the early 1990s, around the time that the U.S. ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1992.

A low-carbohydrate diet with protein and fats primarily from meats may increase susceptibility to heart disease or cancer more so than a high-carbohydrate diet, according to a study published last week by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
“The bottom line is that not all low-carbohydrate diets are created equal,” said Frank B. Hu, a professor of nutrition at the School of Public Health and the study’s principal investigator. “The original Atkins diet, which was loaded with animal fats, is certainly not ideal. Versions of low-carbohydrate diets that are high in vegetable protein and fats are significantly healthier.”
All together, the researchers investigated data from over 85,000 women over a period of 26 years and 44,000 men over a period of 20 years, making the study the largest and most comprehensive to be conducted on the topic of low-carbohydrate diets, according to Hu.
The study found that people who ate the most animal-based proteins and lipids were 14 percent more likely to die from heart disease and 28 percent more likely to die from cancer than those who ate a high-carbohydrate diet.
Low-carbohydrate diets have long been touted as wonderful for weight loss and cardiovascular health. However, according to Teresa T. Fung, the study’s lead author and an adjunct associate professor of nutrition at the School of Public Health, when people want to reduce the amount of carbohydrates they eat, they need to decide where to get their energy replacements.
“Proteins and fats come from many sources,” Fung said.
She said that foods like beans, nuts, and vegetable oils should be preferred over meats and animal fat, though she added that a “plant-based diet” does not necessarily mean a vegetarian diet.
People whose diets had the most plant-based protein and lipid substitutions had a death rate 20 percent lower than those who ate the high-carbohydrate diet.
According to Fung, the results were to be expected because previous research has shown that vegetable proteins and fats have been linked to lower risks of cancer and other diseases, whereas red meats and processed meats have  been observed to cause increased risks of disease.
The researchers emphasized that their low-carbohydrate diet scores are not meant to mimic any commercial diet regimes.
“The risk estimates do not directly translate to assessment of benefit or risk associated with popular versions of the diet,” the study stated.

The Student Life Fund has been renewed with $50,000 for the current academic year, according to an announcement by Dean of the College Evelyn M. Hammonds last Thursday.
The money for the fund—first created by Hammonds in the 2008-2009 academic year—comes from the dean’s  discretionary fund, and is intended to support domestic travel opportunities for student groups, as well as House Committee events, according to Undergraduate Council Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11.
This year’s fund will also support student group travel during winter break, Hysen said.
“[The fund] is a great opportunity for a student group to expand its reach nationally,” said Amanda Lu ’11, former chair of the UC’s Financial Committee.
The financial support from the fund has been especially useful to club sports teams, which have faced shrinking budgets in recent years.
The Harvard Taekwondo team, for example, used a grant from the fund last year to send members to a national tournament in Denver, where several of its members earned medals.
“We sort of count on getting the money,” said Henry S. Xie ’11, president of Harvard Taekwondo. “We wouldn’t have been able to go without it.”
A portion of the Student Life Fund will be distributed directly to various HoCos to support House events, most commonly House formals.
In the past, HoCos received an additional $1,200 each semester from the fund—with the exception of the 2009 fall semester—when the College delayed the renewal of the fund until the spring semester, citing a need to review the purpose and use of the fund.
Management of the fund also switched hands last year from the UC to the Office of Student Life, which will retain responsibility for reviewing and approving grants from the fund this year.
Though Hysen said the UC is pleased with the earlier renewal of the grant this year, many representatives say they would like to see the Council play a bigger role in the distribution of the fund.
“The UC would be a more appropriate body to make these allocations,” said Luis A. Martinez ’12, chair of the UC’s Financial Committee.
Hysen added that he hopes the fund will eventually become a fixture of student life at the College.
“Because it’s coming out of the dean’s discretionary budget, it’s tougher to make it a permanent program,” he said. “We definitely would like to formalize it in the future.”

Students wrestled with a mechanical bull, feasted on nachos and corn dogs, and battled for victory in a human foosball game at the Harvard Carnival on Friday.
Around 4,000 undergraduates attended the sixth annual welcome-back event in Harvard Yard, organized by the College Events Board, according to Fellow for Student Life Andres Castro Samayoa ’10.
Clowns scattered across Tercentenary Theatre twisted balloons into animals and hats. Near University Hall, a cotton candy machine made stick after stick of the sugary treat. A magician performed card tricks for clusters of students seated on bales of hay. As pop hits boomed from speakers, students whirled hula-hoops around their hips and ate rainbow-swirl lollipops.
Across from Widener Library, an ever-present line of eager students waited for one of the carnival’s main events: a mechanical bull that jerked and bucked until its rider fell onto a padded surface.
Brian A. Riemer ’12, a carnival attendee, managed to stay on the bull for about a minute, he estimated.
Carnival games like Skeeball rewarded winners with tickets that could be redeemed for prizes: stuffed animals, inflatable guitars, and an official Harvard Carnival t-shirt, the grand prize worth 50 tickets.
“It’s a cool way to meet people, and I got enough tickets to get a t-shirt,” said Catherine C. Gu ’14.
Since only Currier and Mather House dining halls were open, trucks parked on either side of Emerson Hall stored food that had to feed most of the campus. 		Two parallel rows of tables were host to various forms of barbecue fare: pretzels, nachos, corn dogs, pasta salad, and sandwiches.
Organizers said that they were happy with both the turnout and the ambiance of the event even though they had to postpone it for a week due to Hurricane Earl, a storm that threatened the Cambridge area but proved to be a no-show.
“I thought it was disappointing that we had to push it back a week,” said CEB vice-chair Stephen G. Anastos Jr. ’11, adding that he was happy with the turnout for the carnival.
“People seemed to hang around for a while, and that’s the best indication,” said Anastos, who said his blockmates “came out in full force” to drench him at the dunk tank.
Last year’s welcome-back celebration, “Aloha Harvard,” was Hawaiian-themed. Also in Tercentenary Theatre, the festivities included a surfboard ride, free leis, and volleyball.
But every year’s welcome-back celebration has a similar purpose.
“It’s really nice to have an opportunity for everyone, from first-years to seniors, to come together,” said Castro Samayoa.

After losing its petition for a permit to build antennas on a building across from the Law School, AT&T filed a federal lawsuit on Friday against the City of Cambridge, stating that “[w]ireless service is important to public safety and convenience.”
According to the document filed at the U.S. District Court in Boston, AT&T sought to erect the antenna on the roof of 1558 Massachusetts Ave. in order to remedy the “significant gap” in its network coverage in the area north of Harvard Square.
The Cambridge Zoning Ordinance required AT&T to obtain a special permit in order to place the antenna on the residential building’s roof.
As a result, AT&T applied to the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeals in December 2009. After AT&T revised their original application, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeals reviewed the wireless provider’s petition on June 24.
During the hearing, three of the five Board members voted in support of AT&T, but a vote of four is required to approve of an appeal.
The Board of Zoning Appeals cited in its decision that AT&T’s application failed to meet one or more of the five criteria under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance’s section for special permits. The decision failed to specify which criteria were not met.
In its suit, AT&T claimed that the Board’s decision has caused “irreparable harm.” The company cited provisions of the Telecommunications Act, which seeks “to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for American telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.”
According to Constantine Alexander, chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals, AT&T is not the first company to be turned down a special permit and file a lawsuit in Cambridge, though he could not recall other cases within the last six to eight years.
Installing the antennas could compromise the building’s aesthetics, Alexander said, suggesting a reason AT&T’s petition had been denied.
The document submitted on Friday explained that AT&T’s plans for facilities on top of the building on 1558 Massachusetts Ave. would consist of 12 antennas “mounted within six artificial (or faux) chimneys matching the existing chimneys,” and equipment cabinets in the basement of the building. At the hearing in June, the company also presented a sample of the fiberglass brick that would cover the chimneys.
Harvard Street Management, the company that manages the residential building in question, could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a team returns only two of its top five players from the year before, early struggles and unexpected outcomes are normal. But yesterday at the Sebonack Golf Course in Southampton, N.Y., the Harvard men’s golf team showed few early-season jitters and posted a performance that was very similar to the last time the Crimson was on the links in team competition.
In the season-opening tournament for Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the three teams finished in exactly the same order as they finished at the 2010 Ivy League Championships, with comparable margins. The Bulldogs—last year’s Ivy runner-ups—led the way, taking eight out of the 15 total available points. The Crimson, which took fifth last year, finished in the middle with four. In third with two points were the Tigers, who finished second to last in the Ancient Eight a year ago.
As any mathematician would notice, eight plus four plus two does not equal 15. The discrepancy between possible points and awarded points can be attributed to the fact that Harvard junior Mark Pollak and Princeton’s Bernie D’Amato both finished at the No. 1 spot for their respective teams. Usually in that situation, both competitors are awarded half points, but that was not the case yesterday, as officials elected to give neither player any points. Both Pollak and D’Amato fell to Yale’s Bradley Kushner.
“My performance wasn’t what I hoped it would have been,” Pollak said. “The Yale kid played extremely well. Bernie had a tough time as well, but we ended up tied.”
The other juniors on the team, No. 2 player and captain Tony Grillo and No. 5 player Connor Wentzell, split their competition, defeating their Tiger counterparts but falling to their Bulldog ones.
Grillo topped Princeton junior Evan Harmeling, 4 and 3, but fell to Yale captain Tom McCarthy by the same score. Wentzell defeated Tigers junior Patrick Wasserman, 5 and 4, but fell, 1 up, to his Bulldog counterpart, junior Jeffrey Hatten.
“We all played fairly well,” Grillo said. “None of us have been playing spectacularly.”
Solid play was not enough to get past Yale this weekend, a feat only rookie Seiji Liu was able to accomplish. Liu knocked off Yale’s Brandon Merrick, 6 and 5, and Princeton’s Chase Lovett-Woodsum, 4 and 3.
Liu was named one of Golfweek Magazine’s “20 Freshmen to Watch” last week.
“Seiji was great,” Grillo said. “He’s definitely a promising freshman.”
The other rookie playing this weekend, Theo Lederhausen, did not have the same luck as Liu, losing both of his matches at the No. 3 spot.
Despite his first-match struggles, Lederhausen is expected to be a strong asset to the team this year.
“The freshmen are fitting in really well,” Pollak said. “We can tell [Lederhausen] is a great player. He’s going to contribute.”
“It was a good chance to see our freshmen play,” Grillo added. “I think we did just that.”
This weekend’s tournament, the first of the year, offered all three teams a chance to test their skills. While the hierarchy remains as it was last May, the three teams have a full school year before the results really matter again. For a Crimson team looking to improve upon last year’s performance, the extra time may be just the ticket.
“It’s the first tournament of the year,” Pollak said. “We’re getting started. It’s a learning experience; we hopped back on the horse.”
According to Grillo, there’s no better place to start the season than the Sebonack Golf Course. Designed by Jack Nicklaus and Tom Doak, the course was named “America’s Best New Course” in Golf Digest’s Jan. 2008 issue. Harvard’s golfers don’t seem to disagree.
“It was definitely the best course we’ve played,” Grillo said. “We were treated great. They couldn’t have been happier to have us. It was definitely the nicest facility—it was definitely the hardest as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Homecoming was not so sweet for the three Florida natives on the Harvard women’s soccer team, who returned to the Sunshine State for the Crimson’s two weekend contests against the University of Central Florida (4-2) and the University of South Florida (5-1-1).
Harvard (1-2-1) returned to Cambridge from its weekend road jaunt with two tallies in the loss column after falling to UCF, 3-0, on Friday and USF, 2-1, yesterday.
The Crimson was held to just two shots on goal in Friday’s contest but managed to respond with a stronger performance against USF, finishing with a goal and five shots on target. But two scores in less than a minute from USF kept Harvard winless on the weekend.
“Friday night was not a great game for us,” said co-captain Gina Wideroff. “The ball wasn’t moving around. We weren’t playing well mentally or physically. [Yesterday] we responded. The effort was a lot better, but we couldn’t get the result.”
USF 2, HARVARD 1
After Harvard was shut out in Friday’s contest, the Crimson offense got off to a hot start against USF. Freshman Elizabeth Weisman netted Harvard’s first goal of the weekend—and the first goal of her career—11 minutes into the contest, finishing a through ball from junior Patty Yau to take the 1-0 lead.
But that lead would evaporate in less than seven minutes.
Bull forward Venicia Reid notched back-to-back scores in less than a minute to give her team the 2-1 lead.
Reid’s first score came in the 17th minute when she received a lead pass along the sideline and then beat Harvard sophomore keeper AJ Millet.
“They broke in on the left side and just kind of swatted a really nice shot into the corner,” said Millet, who finished with two saves.
Reid struck again 31 seconds later, this time beating two defenders and then notching her fifth score of the season.
“We sort of just let up mentally,” Wideroff said. “We weren’t focused for those two minutes, and that’s what lost the game for us.”
Harvard managed to notch three more shots on goal in the contest but was unable to find the back of the net for the equalizer. Weisman led the charge offensively, finishing with four shots. Sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro chipped in with two shots on target, but was unable to beat USF goalie Nicole McClure, who finished with three saves.
“We were working harder [yesterday], and we created our chances,” Wideroff said. “We just couldn’t get that goal that would have sent it to overtime.”
UCF 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard opened its weekend slate on Friday night in Orlando in disappointing fashion against defending Conference USA champion UCF. Riding a three-game winning streak, the Knights did not let up for their matchup with the Crimson.
UCF got off to a hot start, scoring its first of three goals in the eighth minute when Katie Jackson finished a pass from Kim Newsome in front of the net.
The Knights struck again 20 minutes later, this time off a header from Bianca Joswiak to take the commanding 2-0 lead.
The Crimson, missing top scorer and co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh due to a minor injury, failed to respond offensively, registering just two shots on goal in 90 minutes.
Harvard had its first chance to get on the scoreboard in the 56th minute when freshman Peyton Johnson—coming off a goal and an assist last weekend—took a shot that was knocked away by UCF goalkeeper Aline Reis.
Yau also managed to put a shot on target, but backup goalie Jaclyn Meade came up with a save of her own to keep the Crimson scoreless for the first time this season.
Joswiak added her second score of the contest early in the second half, sealing the 3-0 victory for the Knights.
“Friday’s game wasn’t our best game,” Millet said. “I think it didn’t really go as we hoped it would.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any athlete will tell you that no amount of drills and practice can replace the invaluable experience gained from playing together in a live-game situation. It’s crucial to work out chemistry and lineups and see what fits best.
It is this experience that makes playing in pre-Ivy tournaments so crucial to teams, and it also means that a sterling record isn’t the objective of the weekend.
The Harvard women’s volleyball team (2-5) went 1-3 over the weekend at the Fordham Invitational, losing to Fordham (6-5), Stony Brook (4-7), and Syracuse (12-0), but earning a win over Rider (1-8).
“We are trying to develop both our offensive and defensive systems,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We are playing different people at different positions, so it’s coming together.”
“And that’s the goal, coming together for the Ivies,” Weiss added. “We beat Rider and we battled with the other ones, so there were a lot of good things that came from this weekend.”
SYRACUSE 3, HARVARD 0
In the final match of the tournament, the Crimson fell to Syracuse, 25-13, 25-18, 25-20. Despite losing all three sets, the team was proud of the way it competed, especially with regards to blocking.
“We really got our system going...establishing a strong block on the outside,” co-captain Miyoko Pettit said. “Our blocking was off the charts in our game against Syracuse. It was really solid—our opponents really didn’t know what to do.”
Syracuse used a strong opening run to jump out to a 19-10 lead in the first set, a lead Harvard could not overcome. The rest of the sets dropped in similar fashion.
Junior libero Christine Wu highlighted Harvard’s efforts in the loss, tallying 14 digs, which earned her all-tournament honors. Senior Mikaelle Comrie and freshman Erin Cooney had seven and six kills, respectively, in the loss, while sophomore Taylor Docter and junior Sandra Lynne Fryhofer each notched three blocks.
“I think we actually ended on good note tonight against Syracuse,” Weiss said. “The level that Syracuse is playing is very high, very strong, and we played them point for point. They were hitting at a higher point, and we were right there with the blocking.”
STONY BROOK 3, HARVARD 1
In the first match Saturday morning, Stony Brook toppled the Crimson, 25-19, 25-19, 20-25, 25-21.
Seawolves used a strong start to breeze through the first set. But Harvard would respond, getting a 13-9 lead halfway through the second set. Stony Brook rallied, using a 15-6 run to seal the second set.
The third set saw the Crimson’s fortunes change, as the team went on a 9-1 run to break open what had been a tight game. But the Seawolves rebounded to take a close fourth set, 25-21.
“[Against] Stony Brook, we absolutely had some more mistakes than in the other two matches,” Weiss said. “We came out kind of slow. We tried to make a comeback in the third game, we won that, and we played well in the fourth game. I was really proud of the way we played in those last two games.”
Junior Anne Carroll Ingersoll, who has been struggling with injuries through preseason, put on a strong showing, earning eight kills and four blocks for the Crimson.
HARVARD 3, RIDER 1
The final match of the opening day saw Harvard win convincingly against Rider, 25-18, 21-25, 25-18, 25-18.
“We were stronger than they were in terms of our overall offense,” Weiss said. “We really used our middle offense and scored a lot from the middle attack. And so that was good—we were definitely dominant [in] that match.”
Docter and Fryhofer each had 11 kills, Docter also added 12 digs, while Cooney had nine kills.
“Rider was very good for building our confidence,” Pettit said. “Almost everyone got to play, and that’s not something we’ve always had in past seasons.”
Harvard used a 9-2 run to open a lead and win the opening set. After a slight hiccup in the second, Harvard would use an 11-5 run to take the third set, and began the fourth set 6-1 to pull away for good.
FORDHAM 3, HARVARD 0
The Crimson lost in three tight sets to open up the tournament on Friday, dropping the match, 25-22, 29-27, 25-23.
“[Against] Fordham, the games were very tight games, [and] we played well,” Weiss said. “We played one for one, and we were really working on controlling our unforced errors.”
Docter spearheaded the Crimson’s offensive effort, tallying 12 kills and two aces .
“Overall, it was a productive weekend,” Weiss said. ”We know learned a lot about what we need to work on to prepare for the future and the Ivies.”

To begin its fall campaign, the Harvard women’s tennis team traveled to Williamsburg, Va. to participate in the 18th Annual William and Mary Women’s Tennis Invitational this weekend. Despite just beginning its practices last Tuesday, the squad hoped to see how it fared against other quality teams from along the East Coast.
“I thought this weekend was a solid first tournament,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “It was a good way to get our feet wet and shake off the cobwebs…but there is a lot of room for improvement…In order to be a top team, we need to work on our doubles positioning and shot selection for singles.”
Flight A saw the Crimson’s top two stars in action against other top opponents.
No. 56 Holly Cao, the third seed in the flight, defeated Virginia’s Erin Vierra, 6-4, 6-0, Marshall’s Dominika Zaprazna, 6-2, 6-0, and No. 45 Lindsey Hardenbergh representing the Cavaliers, 6-0, 6-2.
“I think I played some good tennis, especially in the later matches,” Cao said. “I guess I tried to dominate the points, and it worked out well for me.”
Harvard’s junior co-captain finally met a 6-3, 6-2 defeat in yesterday’s flight A championship against Ivy League rookie Connie Hsu, a blue-chip left-handed recruit joining Penn this year.
“[Hsu] played very well in the final and had the upper hand,” Cao said. “We had a lot of close deuces…She’s a very high quality player. She’ll really add depth in the Ivy League. I’ll probably play her again in the Ivy season.”
No. 114 Hideko Tachibana—coming off her unanimous Ivy League Rookie of the Year and All-Ivy first-team selections—began her sophomore year with a loss to Hsu, 6-3, 6-4, before upsetting No. 97 Kateryna Yergina, from Virginia Commonwealth, 6-4, 6-4. Tachibana went on to win 7-5, 6-3 over Winthrop’s Eliszaveta Zaytseva.
Flight B showcased sophomore Kristin Norton as the No. 3 seed as well as freshman and five-star recruit Natalie Blosser.
Norton faced some trouble to start her season, losing to William & Mary’s Marivick Mamlit, 6-2, 6-2 and the Thundering Herd’s Kristina Kopricina, 6-4, 6-3. Norton finally found victory in her final match against Virginia’s Rashmi Teltumbde.
Blosser, who played for National Cathedral School for Girls in Washington, D.C. last year, began her career with a tough match against the flight’s second seed, Hana Toljanovic from Virginia, 6-2, 6-3. Blosser also lost to Richmond’s Sydney Grant, 7-5, 6-7 (4), 10-4, before defeating fourth seed Shannon Betts of Virginia Tech, 4-6, 7-6 (3), 10-6.
“[Blosser] will add some depth to our roster this year,” Green said. “Natalie has a lot of promise and has energy. She needs to work on channeling that energy to the right place at the right time. She has a lot of power, and she’s fun to watch out there. She’s very tenacious.”
Co-captain Samantha Rosekrans represented Harvard in flight C as the second seed. She opened the tournament with a win over the Spiders’ Kelly Tidwell, 7-5, 6-3, and Old Dominion’s Arina Alilueva 6-3, 3-0, at which point Alilueva retired. The second-year captain finally lost to the Rams’ Olga Terteac, 6-3, 7-5, but came from behind to defeat the Cavaliers’ Caryssa Peretz, the fourth seed, 2-6, 7-5, 11-9.
Sophomore Alex Lehman opened her matches in flight D with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 loss to Virginia Commonwealth’s Odaria Yakauleva. After her initial troubles, Lehman went on to win against Columbia’s Chelsea Davis, the third seed, 6-0, 6-3, and Marshall’s top-seeded Maria Voscekova, 6-3, 6-4.
Freshman Amanda Black was the second seed in flight E and began her collegiate career with a loss to Richmond’s Ripley Hartmeyer, 6-4, 6-3 on Friday. The following day, the recruit from Cambridge, England lost to Columbia’s Katerina Kovacevic, 3-6, 7-5, 10-6. In flight A of doubles, Harvard’s top duo of Cao and Rosekrans, ranked No. 40 in the nation and the third seed in the flight, opened the season with a win against the Hokies’ Yasmin Hamza and Tea Ivanovich, 8-5. In their final match, the tandem defeated the Thundering Herd’s Michaela Kissel and Kopricina.
“We could have done better in doubles,” Cao said despite the wins. “With more practice, I’m sure the team will get a lot better.”
Also in flight A, Norton and Tachibana teamed up to take on Voscekova and Zapranza but lost 8-6. The duo came back to win against the Monarchs’ Joanna Dobrowolska and Diana Ivanova, 9-8 (4), but lost its final match to the Tribe’s Anik Cepada and Jeltje Loomans, 8-5.
In the doubles flight B, Black and Lehman teamed up to defeat Kovacevic and teammate Natasha Makarova, 8-5, but lost to fourth seed Betts and Isel Martinez-Marcos, 8-6. In their next match, Black and Lehman lost to Grant and Joanna Matuszczyk, 8-5.

Harvard field hockey suffered two tough one-goal losses this weekend during the Sheraton Catamount Classic at Moulton Winder Field in Burlington, Vt. The Crimson (2-2) was defeated by Maine (4-2), 2-1, on Saturday and then dropped a 1-0 double-overtime decision to Vermont (3-3) yesterday. Sophomore goaltender Cynthia Tassopoulos, who totaled 11 saves in two games, and junior co-captain Carly Dickson were named to the all-tournament team.
“It was our first set of away games,” sophomore Kim Goh said, “[and] having it back-to-back was a challenge.”
VERMONT 1, HARVARD 0 (2OT)
The Catamounts scored in the 91st minute of play yesterday afternoon to steal the victory from Harvard. Vermont broke through the tenacious Crimson defense with a long through pass, and Brittanie Booker sent the ball into the back of the net for the win.
“It was a heartbreaker,” Goh said. “To go to double overtime, it all comes down to the seconds. Everyone did their part and went 100 percent. We had a little bit of a breakdown, and they got one in.”
In a game dominated by great defense, Harvard held the edge in ball control and shots taken. The Crimson outshot the Catamounts, 17-11, but could not turn those opportunities into points—due in part to the performance of Vermont goaltender Brooke Crane.
“We made a lot of changes [after Saturday’s game],” Goh said. “We did a lot of things really well, like pressuring the ball hard and high up the field so we’d have a lot of counterattack opportunities. In the end, we had a little trouble executing when it came down to putting the ball in the back of the cage.”
Senior Chloe Keating and Dickson registered six and four shots, respectively.
“We really did leave everything we had out on the field though, and our team is very proud of each other,” sophomore Emma Keller said. “We definitely improved our play from [Saturday] against UMaine, so it was quite disappointing not coming out with a win.”
MAINE 2, HARVARD 1
Harvard lost its tourney opener on Saturday afternoon to a persistent Maine team that overcame the Crimson defense in the final 10 minutes to seal the game. The Black Bears took the lead in the second half and never looked back, and despite Harvard’s best efforts to equalize, Maine came away with a win.
“We played a much stronger team in Maine,” Tassopoulos said. “We were certainly a little hesitant at the beginning, but we got a little more comfortable as the game went on, [and] for the rest of the game, we really tried to stay neck-to-neck with them.”
Even though the Crimson scored first in each of its first two games, the Black Bears took the early lead in the eighth minute when Kelly Newton tipped in a rebound off a long shot off the stick of Stephanie Gardiner.
It wasn’t long before Harvard equalized with a scramble in front of the net, with freshman Rachael Rosenfeld ultimately putting the ball into the cage. It was the freshman’s first career goal, and she was assisted by Keating, marking the 10th point of the young season for the senior standout.
The game settled down into a defensive battle between the two teams. Both teams made momentum-stopping interceptions, and neither team could capitalize on its breakaway chances. Tassopoulos set the tone for the defense with eight saves.
“We knew that they were a team that was very aggressive,” Tassopoulos said. “So we tried to put early pressure on them and stop them before they could even get shots off.”
The physical nature of the game wore down Harvard’s energy, and this contributed to the Crimson’s inability to score in the second half.
After Maine’s Michelle Niedziejko scored with less than 10 minutes remaining in the game, Harvard put together several well-played series but could not find the back of the net.
“The last seven minutes,” Rosenfeld said, “our pressing was really good and on point, and that should’ve been [our mindset] for the entire game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team did just enough to stay afloat in a four-game weekend that nearly ended without a win.
The Crimson took on some of the nation’s top-ranked teams this Saturday and Sunday at the Princeton Invitational in Princeton, N.J. Harvard (2-4) lost to No. 17 Cal Baptist (6-1), 15-12, and to No. 18 Princeton (3-2), 14-9, on the first day of play and then dropped a 17-2 decision to No. 13 Santa Clara (3-2) before beating George Washington (3-5), 9-8, yesterday afternoon.
The first three games, all against elite opponents, represented perhaps the most challenging part of the Crimson’s season schedule.
“I think this stretch with three ranked teams in less than 24 hours was definitely our toughest stretch so far,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said, “and probably the toughest of the whole year.”
The weekend’s difficult lineup of opponents also came just after a Crimson loss to then-No. 14 St. Francis at last week’s MIT Invitational. Despite the losing record, Harvard’s players felt that the games at Princeton allowed them to improve and develop as a unit.
“It’s clearly not the way we wanted to finish, but we can take away a lot of lessons from each game,” Minnis agreed.
In the end, the Crimson was able to put some of those lessons together to get a victory before the weekend was out.
HARVARD 9, GEORGE WASHINGTON 8
Harvard water polo has made a habit of making several of its games close until the very end, and yesterday’s matchup was no different.
Despite having almost two whole days of grueling play behind it, the Crimson struck early against the Colonials and built up a 3-0 lead in the first period.
“We definitely bounced back [against George Washington],” co-captain Bret Voith said, “which was great after having such a disappointing game that morning.”
But the Colonials wouldn’t go away quietly and came back to within one before the half.
George Washington took the lead in third period, but with just under three minutes left in the fourth, Voith scored to make it 8-8.
On a play coming out of a timeout with about 30 seconds left on the clock, sophomore Max Eliot came up big for the Crimson, burying one in the back of the net to secure the win.
“It was such a back-and-forth game,” Minnis said. “But we didn’t get frustrated when we lost the lead, and that’s why we were able to get it back.”
NO. 13 SANTA CLARA 17, HARVARD 2
Santa Clara was the highest ranked team on Harvard’s schedule, and the Broncos certainly played like it in the teams’ matchup early yesterday morning.
With the Crimson clearly exhausted, both physically and mentally, from a pair of tough games the night before, the Broncos quickly tallied up a substantial lead and wouldn’t let up against their outmatched foe.
“They really wore us down early,” Voith said. “But there’s no reason any team in the country should be able to score 17 goals on us.”
With few bright spots in the decisive loss, Harvard could only move on and try to build up its defense in time to face its next opponent.
NO. 18 PRINCETON 14, HARVARD 9
Although the final score may not show it, the Crimson played some of its best water polo all season against the Tigers at home on Saturday night.
With Voith, junior co-captain Luka Babic, and senior Jeff Lee leading the team in scoring, Harvard had the lead at the first two breaks in play.
“I think [Saturday] was the best they’ve played since I’ve been here,” Minnis said. “The way we played in the first half against Princeton was just amazing.”
The Crimson’s defense, including senior goalkeeper Alexandre Popp, looked strong going into the latter part of the game, but it wasn’t enough to hold off a third-period scoring run by the Tigers.
With four more goals in the final period, Princeton came out on top with a five-goal margin.
NO. 17 CAL BAPTIST 15, HARVARD 12
It looked as though Harvard was down for the count in its first game of the weekend when Cal Baptist jumped ahead 7-1 in the first five minutes of play.
Thanks to goals from Eliot and Lee, the game’s top scorers, the Crimson was able to bring its opponent’s lead down to one in the third period.
But the Lancers were able to pull ahead again and handed Harvard its third defeat of the season.
“Obviously going 1-3 wasn’t our goal this weekend,” Voith said. “But we learned a lot about ourselves, and we’re very happy with the team that’s coming out of it.”
The Crimson is now preparing for its home debut next weekend against MIT at the ECAC Championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In soccer, it doesn’t matter how many shots a team takes; in the end, it’s only the ones that go in that count.
The No. 6 Harvard men’s soccer team was thankful that was the case Saturday night, when it managed to play No. 10 Connecticut to a 1-1 draw in Storrs, Conn., despite being outshot by a 25-6 margin.
Eight different players took at least two shots for the Huskies (3-0-1), led by forward Mamadou Diouf, who took a game-high seven.
Luckily for the Crimson (2-0-1), only four of those 26 shots managed to be on goal, three of which were saved by junior keeper Austin Harms.
“UConn was a really good team,” senior Alex Chi said. “But I felt like we had just as many good opportunities as them...they outshot us but most were from long-range; their attempts weren’t really dangerous. Defensively and pressure-wise we played a really solid game.”
Harvard got on the board first when sophomore forward Zack Wolfenzon scored 18 minutes into the first half. Junior Midfielder Jamie Rees took a pass at the top of the 18-yard box from classmate Tim Linden, Rees found Wolfenzon cutting through the box, and Wolfenzon was able to deliver for his first goal of the season.
Later, after eight consecutive unsuccessful Huskie shot attempts, Crimson senior defenseman Robert Millock was called for a handball in the box. With just one minute remaining in the first half, Connecticut forward Stephane Diop drilled the ensuing penalty kick past a diving Harms to tie up the game.
The Huskies outshot Harvard 11-2 in the first half, and had three corner kicks to the Crimson’s zero.
The Harvard defense continued to withstand a swarm of UConn shots in the second half. In the 63rd minute, the Crimson blocked a right-wing attempt by Huskie midfielder Tony Cascio, and a shot by high-scoring Connecticut freshman Mamadou Diouf beat Harms but hit the right post and ricocheted back into play.
“I thought [the defense] played well,” Millock said. “[Rookie Obiajulu] Agha came in and played very well in the second half and the overtime. [Junior] Baba [Omosegbon] was great all game. A lot of the credit goes to the midfielders and forwards for coming back and doubling down and making it hard for them to play the midfield.”
After a Huskie yellow card in the 69th minute, Harvard had a good chance to take the lead, but UConn goalie Josh Ford made a leaping catch on freshman midfielder Kyle Henderson’s free kick to keep the game tied.
In the 80th minute, the Crimson had yet another opportunity to score, but Ford made a save on sophomore Richard Smith’s post-corner kick header attempt. Three minutes later, the Harvard defense blocked consecutive Connecticut shots from the top of the box, and the game remained tied at the end of regulation.
In the first overtime period, Crimson sophomore forward Brian Rogers nearly won his team the game, but his attempt from the top of the box hit the crossbar.
“We had few opportunities [offensively], but we had really good chances when we did have them,” Chi said.
Harvard was unable to muster a shot attempt the rest of the game. Diouf nearly ended it in the 102nd minute with a shot from the close right wing, but Harms was able to dive and deflect the ball over the net with his fingertips. The Huskies were only able to manage one shot the rest of the way, and the match ended in a draw.
In addition to the large shot differential, Connecticut managed nine corner kicks, compared to just one for Harvard.
“I don’t think anyone’s really worried about [the shot differential],” Millock said. “Obviously we’d like to create more opportunities, but whenever they got behind us we never really felt the shots they were taking were quality shots, with the exception of their set pieces and corner kicks.”
Harms finished with three saves in four attempts, many with a rowdy Huskie student section at his back–a significantly better performance than the one he put forward in Storrs last season, when he allowed four UConn goals in a defeat.
“Their student section is great,” Millock said. “Last year they kind of got underneath our skin and rattled us a bit. This year we knew it was coming, we were ready for them, and we tried to use it as motivation.”
“This was the one game where everyone was looking forward to having a rematch against them after the events of last year,” Chi added. “We got the job done, we got a result, so overall we’re satisfied as a team.”

'Fearless’ is perhaps the best word to describe the Radcliffe Rugby Football Club.
The women jumped at the opportunity to go toe-to-toe with competition an entire division above them at last weekend’s Beantown Tournament in Amherst, Mass.
Radcliffe currently competes as a Division II squad during the regular season, but when given the opportunity to move up to the Division I category for this past weekend’s tournament, the team saw an opportunity to test its skills against higher level competition.
In the opening round of  the tournament on Saturday, Radcliffe played UMass-Amherst in the morning and powerhouse Cornell in the afternoon.  Radcliffe defeated UMass, 34-0, but fell to Cornell, 22-7.
“We blew [UMass] out. They didn’t even score on us,” said senior Anna Kamerow, who plays 2nd row. “Then, against Cornell, we started out not as great, a little frantic, but once we settled in, we played a closer game than the score reflects.”
On Sunday morning, Radcliffe faced Cornell once again, this time in the semi-final round. The second time around, the women came out with full intensity from the first whistle.
“In rugby, you rarely get a chance to play a team so quickly again like we did against Cornell,” Kamerow said. “We talked over the first game Saturday night, made some adjustments and clearly [Cornell] was facing a whole new team [Sunday morning].”
Radcliffe tied Cornell 5-5, and while the draw was a huge improvement over Saturday’s loss, it was not enough to advance the women to the finals. The experience the women gained this past weekend playing at the Division I level will be invaluable going forward as the team prepares for its fall game schedule.
The Radcliffe Rugby Football Club opens its regular season at home against the University of Maine next Saturday at 12:30pm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In hockey, defensemen are often assigned to some of the least glamorous tasks. Though critical to their team's victories, they'll rarely make the highlights.
Even off the field, blue liner Angela Ruggiero '02-'04 works under the radar. But her latest task can hardly be considered unglamorous. As an athlete representative on the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Ruggiero is part of a panel evaluating the hosting ability of cities vying to host the 2018 Winter Games.
In other words, she gets to take trips to Munich, Annecy (France) and Pyeongchang (South Korea) to decide which of the three cities would be the best location for the Olympics.
Of course, the panel will do more than just city hop; it will have to study each city's ability to build a site and manage crowds. The process will likely take advantage of Ruggiero's government degree from Harvard, but her findings and those of her peers won't be revealed until 2011.
In May, the IOC members will meet with officials from the candidate cities before releasing a report. Two months later, on July 6, the IOC will vote on the location of the 2018 Games.
Angela Ruggiero's election as an athlete representative on the IOC is the latest in a long list of accolades. An Olympian since she was 15, the defenseman has accumulated four Olympic Medals, including a Gold in 1998. In 2002 and 2006, she was named the top defenseman in the Olympic Games, and has been named the top defenseman at the World Championships four times. Ruggiero earned four All-America honors while with the Crimson and won the Patty Kazmaier Award in 2004.

As the real-life protagonist of the 2003 made-for-TV movie “Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story,” Elizabeth “Liz” Murray '04-'09 was already on her way to becoming a celebrity in her own right as the heroine of a classic American story. Now, however, she’s released a memoir, which chronicles her assent from the streets of the Bronx to the sanctuary of Harvard Yard.
“Breaking Night: A Memoir of Forgiveness, Survival, and My Journey from Homeless to Harvard” shows how the neglected daughter of two cocaine-addicted, HIV-positive parents managed to make it through high school, into an internship at The New York Times, and, finally, to Cambridge—all without a roof over head.
In an interview with NPR about the book, Murray said she does not hold a grudge against her parents and that, in spite of their neglect and their addictions, they still loved her.
“My parents were addicted to drugs. But at the same time, they were incredibly loving people,” she said. “People can’t give you what they don’t have.”
In the same interview, Murray said that "Breaking Night," the title of her memoir, refers to the experience of staying up all night until the first flash of sunlight, which was how she described her situation before she realized she was technically “homeless.”
The book was released on Sept. 7 by Hyperion and is priced at $24.99.

On Friday, we reported on the number of Swedish Fish that have been popping up on the walkways on campus, but it seems like they’re not the only creatures out and about in Harvard Square.
Catfish have now been spotted on the steps leading up to Lamont, as well as in between the stripes of the crosswalk on Quincy Street leading up to the Barker Center. So what's the deal?
A visit to the website listed below each fish leads to a promotion for "Catfish," a thriller about the brother of one of movie's directors and an eight-year-old girl from Michigan who contacts him via Facebook.
But the movie is only scheduled to premiere in Los Angeles, New York, Austin, and San Francisco this Friday, so why has some sneaky tagger decided to promote the film here in Cambridge?
CampusU Harvard, now in its second year at Harvard, is the on-campus marketing team for Universal Pictures and works to show advance film screenings to the Harvard community. Kate K. Ma ’12, one of the campus representatives, said that a free advance screening of "Catfish" will be held on Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the AMC Loews Harvard Square theater—the first of a number of screenings this year.
And the catfish loitering around campus?
“It’s just a new, innovative way for publicity," Ma said. "The stencils and spray chalk are meant to make people pause, grab their attention, and make them want to find out more.”
