There is no question that these are trying times, financially speaking, and Harvard is certainly not immune to market fluctuations. As a result of recent endowment losses, the university is currently undergoing a review of all of its capital spending projects, including its timeline for construction in Allston. However, despite the instinct to reduce spending in light of the current financial climate, Harvard should not delay its planned expansion across the river. 
Harvard is committed, first and foremost, to imparting knowledge and facilitating research. Creating a new science complex in Allston will further both of these ends by providing opportunities for academic pursuits and scientific breakthroughs. Harvard has an obligation to pursue these goals to the fullest extent possible and should therefore continue to follow its 50-year plan in Allston. 
The alternative—letting funds earmarked for construction sit in Harvard’s endowment, gaining very little interest—stalls the construction process without any noticeable academic or monetary gain. In light of the benefits of expanding on schedule, namely the vast amount of research that can begin to take place once Harvard has additional space, it seems unwise to wait for the market to improve before initiating the expansion process.
In a sense, creating a new section of campus in Allston can be seen as an investment in the endowment. With the added space and higher-quality facilities promised there, Harvard will be able to expand its research capacities, and in so doing draw in money for the university. These facilities will also provide higher-quality education for Harvard’s students—students who will one day become alumni and potentially give back to their alma mater. The better Harvard can prepare these scientific minds for professional careers, the more successful Harvard alumni will be, allowing them to regenerate Harvard’s endowment in the future.
Harvard is both an academic institution and a business, but, in order to maintain   its tradition of educational excellence and rigor, it must keep these two interests essentially separate. From the perspective of academics, creating new facilities in Allston will have a profoundly positive effect on the quality of scientific pursuits at Harvard, and that is reason enough to expand as soon as possible. 
Harvard must remember its obligations as an institution committed to research, despite the financial situation. We hope that the university will continue full speed ahead and will soon be breaking ground on the other side of the Charles.

The vote came amidst a global economic downturn, as protectionism was on the rise everywhere and the masses feared for their economic security. It was supposed to be just another election, like many before and many to come. But on March 5, 1933, the German people put the last nail in the coffin of the Weimar Republic, overwhelmingly electing the National-Socialist Workers’ Party to their national parliament, the Reichstag. 
The calculating new Chancellor of the Republic, an Austrian named Adolf Hitler, made sure that German democracy ceased to exist after that election. Almost 76 years later, on February 15, 2009, Venezuelans will face a similar vote in a referendum proposed by President Hugo Chávez to allow him to “seek re-election indefinitely.” In order to preserve their democracy, they ought to say no. 
This is not the first time Chávez has attempted to perpetuate himself in power. Two years ago, he proposed a referendum to modify the constitution to allow him to seek unlimited re-election and better implant his version of “21st-century socialism”. He argued that the Venezuelan constitution constrained his grip on power in a way that prevented his model society from coming to fruition. 
But despite Chávez’s subsequent crackdown on the political opposition, his proposal was narrowly defeated, 51 to 49 percent. According to press reports, it was a cinematic ending to a dramatic saga in Venezuelan politics. Upon hearing the news, Chávez promised a sequel, grumbling that “For now, we couldn’t.” 
Now he is trying again. If approved, his proposal could allow him to stay in power indefinitely and use his state power to annihilate any political dissent. In the last few years, apart from disrespecting contracts with foreign oil companies and eschewing American involvement in the region, Chávez has repeatedly attacked any media outlet that opposes his rule. Most notably, two years ago he refused to renew the broadcasting license of a TV station, RCTV, that he identified with the political opposition. With such dismal track record, the power of unlimited re-election would be tantamount to burying Venezuelan democracy forever. 
In a way, Chávez is a very Latin American problem. Like his hero Simón Bolívar, he thinks he is indispensable to Venezuela, an oil-rich country that has terrible internal problems, most notably a lack of durable democratic institutions and entrenched economic inequality. In fact, he was originally an army paratrooper who became famous in 1992 when he attempted to overthrow the constitutional government in a failed coup d’etat. Old habits die hard.
In the following years, Chávez has worked within the system and eventually accessed power democratically in 1998, mainly supported by the urban lower classes. During his decade in power, he has made Venezuela a stronghold of anti-Americanism and political radicalism. A visionary critic of the Washington Consensus, he initially pledged to end Venezuelan inequality. After nationalizing oil contracts in the country and forcing out foreign investors, he has used the money for lavish projects in Venezuela that have bought him unprecedented support. 
Chávez has also used Venezuela’s petroleum wealth to extend his influence in the region while the Bush administration focused elsewhere. In particular, he has invested in his ideological allies in the region, including Fidel Castro’s Cuba, Evo Morales’s Bolivia, and Rafael Correa’s Ecuador. But, for all his hatred of the United States, Chávez remains a dutiful producer of oil for American consumption, delivering over a million barrels a day to the evil superpower in the north. As a result, he has become an unfortunate byproduct of U.S. dependency on foreign oil. 
The global economic crisis, however, has changed the political and economic landscape. Although inflation continues to be rampant, growth is now uncertain, given the sluggish demand in developed countries. With oil prices hitting unforeseen lows, he can afford neither the vast federal projects in Venezuela nor his bullish foreign policy favoritism. 
This year alone, the opposition in Venezuela estimates that there will be a $30 billion gap between planned state spending and income. As the referendum looms, he has refused to cut down on spending; instead, he has shamelessly plunged into Venezuela’s foreign currency reserves. According to some reports, he has already spent close to a third of the central bank’s assets. These unsustainable spending patterns would effectively doom the country’s future in the event of a crisis in confidence like the one that would follow a Chávez victory next week. 
Chávez is attempting to delay the painful but inevitable hard choices in the sphere of Venezuelan political economy until after the referendum. Much like the German parliamentary elections of 1933, this referendum is a high-stakes gamble for absolute political hegemony. With his grip on state power, it would be very hard to remove him democratically once indefinite re-election is constitutionally allowed. So nothing less than Venezuela’s democratic institutions are on the line. But, if Venezuelans manage to reject Chavez’s delusions of autocracy once more, there will most likely be no “next time around.”

I’m writing fractions on the whiteboard with my back to my students—a risky move, but this is a relatively calm class. “OK, so who can tell me the least common denominator of four and six?”
“12!” Not a voice I recognize. I turn around.
“Rick? You’re not in this class. Where are you supposed to be?”
“Lunch.”
“And you want to stay and add fractions?”
“Yeah, Mr. Kelly!”
“Um… OK. Grab a worksheet then, and take out a pencil…”
This happens quite a bit, and I’m never sure how to respond to it. You say you could be doing nothing, but you’d rather be here working on fractions, which rank up there with “snitches” and “beaucoup pages on this test” on students’ “Most Hated” list? Well, fine—what can I say? Sit down and start converting mixed numbers.
Of course, I know it isn’t fractions—or my frequent, terrible math jokes—that brought Rick into my classroom. He wandered in because he knows that I’m always teaching something, making something up, throwing something out there. I don’t always do it well, and my kids don’t always get it, but they do always respond to energy and creativity.
I teach at a school in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. It’s an underachieving school even by the standards of where Teach for America places its members. We take students who weren’t able to pass out of eighth grade before they became too old to start high school. Some have been thrown out of two or three middle schools, and many served time in juvenile detention for a colorful range of offenses. Others simply lost a year as orphans of the storm, Katrina kids mishandled by overwhelmed officials in Houston, Atlanta, or Arkansas who fell behind and never caught up. They’ve all been shuffled around, victims of the system who did not get the support they needed at some critical point in their development. 
All over the country, there are amazing teachers trying to reach these students, some of whom have been producing astonishing success in their classrooms for decades. But there aren’t enough of them, and they can’t reach everyone. This is why my kids—every one of them behind and at risk, every one of them needing an excellent teacher—ended up with me.
At the moment I’m less than one year out of college, still amazed that, with my History and Literature degree, I’m teaching math to students who are usually five or six grade levels behind where they should be. I’m still discovering all the places inside our copier where a sheet of algebra problems can crinkle and jam (six and counting!).
And yet, when they’re in my class, the vast majority of my students spend their time graphing inequalities, struggling to remember the rules of decimal multiplication, and finding the surface area of cylinders. They work because I compose worksheets and make up whiteboard games, because I take them to the gym to play “Algebra Jam,” because I act like a madman to get them excited about my (rather arbitrary) team points system. I shower them with praise and affirmation and, occasionally, with Starbursts and Jolly Ranchers for correct answers.
When I was preparing myself to enter the classroom, I worried that when I got in front of a bunch of kids I would suddenly discover that I didn’t have “it”—I might not have the talent, the calling, the innate ability to handle a classroom full of kids. Looking back, of course, none of that even exists. I already possessed the raw materials—dedication, optimism, and commitment, along with reservoirs of patience and creativity I didn’t even know I had. 
The rest was all hard work, forcing myself to get better because I had to, because my kids need and deserve it. And, once I hacked at it for long enough, praising, cajoling, pleading, and teaching my way through indifference and distrust, these amazing young people started to come along for the ride.
My kids want to learn. They don’t always want to learn all day, and they certainly don’t want to be lectured to or, even worse, “preached at.” But even the worst schools in the country are filled with kids who would, if they could, be math juggernauts and masters of English grammar—if they have the right instructor. 
The problems I deal with are incredibly challenging, but the answers usually involve reliance on some combination of hard work, determination, and creative thinking, qualities that Harvard seniors have been refining through four years of long days and late nights spent producing papers and leading student organizations. Educational inequity is a deep and serious problem, and in the long term the systems that educate American children are going to need a lot of help. But, right now, these children need us, as many of us as they can get, to do what we can: to dive in and get working.

A Season for Spending

Ah, Valentine’s Day. A day of love for some, bitterness for others, and little note to the folks holed up in their labs. Yet, no matter the emotion, the central message of the holiday cannot be forgotten: spend money, lots of it.
In 2008, Americans spent $17 billion expressing their love on Valentine’s Day; averaging $123 per consumer, this makes Valentine’s Day the third largest “spending season” of the year. Following the dismally low spending last holiday season, in which sales of luxury goods and electronics fell more than 25 percent, it’s time to start buying again—the flowers, chocolates, and scandalous undergarments you purchase will create jobs for hardworking Americans and get the economy back on track.
Even increased Valentine’s Day spending might not do the job, however, and Easter, the next largest spending day, doesn’t come until April 12. We need a new, Hallmark-based occasion to fiscally demonstrate our love for significant others and bump up consumer spending in March. There are many options to choose from: Johnny Appleseed Day, Single Parent’s Day, National Goof-Off Day, Chocolate Covered Raisin Day, or even National Something-On-A-Stick Day. Best of all is Make Up Your Own Holiday Day on March 26. (I could not make this up.)
Here is our chance to make things right. Forget the bailouts; this Valentine’s Day. Show that special someone you care enough to abandon fiscal responsibility for civic duty. Then get ready to get creative—March 26 is only 40 days away.

A Day Like Any Other
In the days leading up to Feb. 14, many people ask each other tentative questions like, “Do you have special plans for Valentine’s Day?” What they really mean is, “Do you have better plans than me?”
Unfortunately, the holiday is one based on pressure. We feel pressure to show our loved one how much we care; we feel pressure to devise an elaborate and (we hope) somewhat original plan to showcase the depth of our feelings. Many of us, however, are single—and we feel our own kind of pressure, pressure to pair off beforehand, or at least find a date. Outwardly, the holiday appears happy, red, and dazzling, with diamonds to apologize and cards to quantify feelings. Scratch the surface, however, and it can be depressing and excluding.
I have been on either end of the spectrum. I’ve taken girlfriends to Broadway shows and dinners, frittering away hours planning the “perfect gift.” Last year, in contrast, I felt more like a divorcee paying alimony when I was induced to send flowers to an ex-girlfriend just so she wouldn’t be lonely that day. I now recognize the beast beneath the glitter and have come to a realization. If you take the day just as any other, with lower expectations, you’ll have no reason to stress, whether you’re single or hooked.

Alexander R. Konrad ’11, a Crimson editorial writer, is a history concentrator in Quincy House.
Managing the Icy Date

A 1903 encyclopedia of superstition and folklore notes that, if you look down a well on Valentine’s Day, you may see the face of your sweetheart. In Cambridge, where wells are hard to come by, the vision is likelier to appear in a frigid puddle of slush. There you might catch a glimpse of the distressed face of your date as he or she contemplates the next block’s worth of sidewalk acrobatics.
A bit of perverse historical chance dropped the holiday of elegant evening dates down on the part of the calendar worst suited for it. Erratic mountains of ice and curbsides which drop off into unfriendly black abysses make walking anywhere in February a chore. Add in impractical shoes, uncomfortable clothes, and high expectations, and the chore can become catastrophe.
So, if you have nothing else to do on Saturday evening, tear open a bag of Sweethearts, wander around Mt. Auburn Street, and look. You will see girls with bare legs submerged in snow piles, whipped into apoplectic frenzies. You will see bumbling boys unhelpful, frustrated, cold. But, just as often, you will see a good-natured, tough couple laughing in the face of winter—a cheerful reminder that we ought to gauge our days not by the temperature of the freezing rain or the number of bricks missing in the sidewalk, but by the insurrectionary joy with which we confront them.

One seat is sitting empty on the Cambridge City Council following the resignation of Vice Mayor Brian P. Murphy ’86-’87 on Monday.
Murphy, a councillor since 1999 and a long-term member of the ordinance and finance committees, has already begun his new job as deputy secretary for governmental affairs with the Mass. Executive Office of Transportation.
Based on an analysis of the 2007 election results, Larry Ward, a licensed counselor, is likely to be Murphy’s replacement, said local political commentator Robert Winters. 
The Cambridge Election Commission will hold a vacancy recount to officially determine Murphy’s replacement on Feb. 24.
In his resignation speech at Monday’s City Council meeting, Murphy recalled some of the many resolutions the council has passed during his tenure, including reform of the city’s Criminal Offender Record Information policy and efforts to clarify the city’s property tax system.
“As Finance Chair, I’ve been honored to be a part of the strongest fiscal management team in Massachusetts,” Murphy said in his speech. 
Murphy focused on finance prior to joining the council, Winters said. 
He recalled that Murphy went to every budget committee hearing during his first campaign for the council. 
“He’s a guy who did his homework,” Winters said.
Winters, who is also an Extension School professor, praised Murphy as a hard worker behind the scenes of the Council.
“There are other city councillors who go out of their way to take credit for things, including things they don’t deserve credit for,” he said. “Brian worked on lots of things, but didn’t take credit for them.”
In his new post, Murphy will be the liaison to the legislature and other government bodies for the Office of Transportation, according to Adam Hurtubise, spokesman for the office. 
The Cambridge Chronicle reports that Murphy, formerly a full-time city councillor and dad, will see a significant pay raise, from $66,000 a year to $100,000.
Cambridge uses a proportional representation election system, in which voters rank all candidates in order of preference. 
To determine Murphy’s replacement, the election commission will look at only those ballots that were awarded to Murphy in the general election—ballots that ranked him first, or above any extremely low scoring candidate. 
Winters, who publishes political analysis in the online Cambridge Civic Journal, said he has run the election commission’s software using the 2007 election results, and found that Ward will win the vacancy recount.
Ward, a licensed counselor and the owner of a computer store, has lived in Cambridge for more than twenty years, according to his campaign Web site. 
The site lists education, green space, and affordable housing as his primary interests.
All nine city councillors will face reelection this November.

A Nobel-prize winning scientist and a former lobbyist for the National Association of Evangelicals shared the stage at the Harvard Divinity School last night to call for cooperation between scientists and evangelicals on the issue of global climate change.Eric S. Chivian ’64, the director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment, and Reverend Richard Cizik, spoke of their environmental activism in a discussion titled “God and Global Warming: Scientists’ and Evangelicals’ Common Voice.”Chivian and Cizik founded the Scientists and Evangelicals Initiative, a joint effort between the NAE and the Center for Health and the Global Environment, in the fall of 2006 after making a week-long trip to Alaska with leading scientists and evangelicals. During their trip, Chivian and Cizik said they discovered common ground after witnessing the effects of climate change on local populations, the land, and the ocean.“There is no such thing as a liberal or conservative environment, or a secular or religious one,” Chivian said. “We all deeply felt that it was sacred and we had to protect it.” At the Alaskan retreat, the scientists and evangelicals signed a document— “Urgent Call to Action: Scientists and Evangelical Unite To Protect Creation”— and  since then, Chivian and Cizik have been traveling the country to plead for unity in the fight against global climate change. Chivian stressed that global climate change was more than just an environmental issue.“Many people do not realize that climate change is a public health problem,” Chivian said. “Human beings are an inseparable part of nature. The disconnect that people feel with the natural world lies underneath their indifference to global warming.”Cizik cited what he called “an illogical syllogism” as the cause of ignorance in the evangelical community. “We reject evolution and so we reject what the scientists say about the climate.”Katherine C. Wilson ’10, a joint concentrator in History and Science and the Comparative Study of Religion who attended the talk, said that discourse between religion and science is significant because it may lead to the opportunity to render environmentalism nonpolitical.Wilson said that she felt it was important to encourage evangelicals to realize that climate change is a grave issue and to bring that message back to their congregations.—Staff writer Carola A.

The Harvard community celebrated Darwin’s 200th birthday in style with free drinks, science-themed rock bands, cake, decor, and a dancing gorilla.
The birthday party, which was sponsored by the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy and held in the Queen’s Head Pub, concluded a full day’s events that celebrated Darwin, his theory of evolution, and its contributions to humanity.
“It’s really exciting that we’re all here to celebrate Darwin’s birthday,” Elisha W. Rivera ’10, said. “It’s a great day for science,” 
Dr. Andrew J. Berry, who teaches a core course called “Understanding Darwinism,” added that it was a remarkable feat for Darwin to have a “simple idea that explains the staggering organic diversity.”
“Darwin’s is the biggest single idea in the history of ideas,” he said. “It’s one of the very few scientific ideas which has had a ripple effect beyond the sciences.”
Throughout the day, events like the Darwin Day Symposium and an Origin of Species read-a-thon explained the scientific basis of Darwin’s theories and offered a glimpse into the private life of Darwin, the man.
Allison E. Rosenberg ‘12, said she was interested to learn the actual ideas from Darwin’s original words by participating in the read-a-thon. 
“I know I haven’t read the entirety of The Origin of Species, and it’s interesting for me to see exactly how he presents his ideas,” Rosenberg said. 
History of science professor Janet Browne said that she has seen these papers firsthand in an archive with Darwin’s original works, and commented on the magnitude of Darwin’s theory. 
“For me, the magic of [Darwin] is to be able to open up his papers, see his writing,” Browne said at the Darwin Day Symposium, which also featured Stephen Pinker, Hopi E. Hoekstra, Marc D. Hauser, and Arkhat Abzhanov.
But the day was far from being purely academic.
Birthday cakes were served during meals and a troop of friendly gorillas interrupted classes and wandered through dining halls.
“Tourists were taking photographs of me in the gorilla suit,” said Fernando Racimo ’11, who was one of the seven members of Team Gorilla. “I think I scared some people, though, especially when I started talking.”
The day’s events were organized by Hann-Shuin Yew ’10 with assistance and funding from Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, the Life Sciences Division, Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering, the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, the Humanities Center, and the Harvard University Press.
Despite the importance of Darwin’s theory of evolution, there is still much debate about the validity of the theory. A Gallup poll conducted this Wednesday showed that only 39% of Americans say they “believe in the theory of evolution.”
But Racimo, who is an OEB concentrator, said that he hopes the celebration of Darwin will entice people to look at the evidence. 
“Hopefully, Darwin Day 200 will raise a higher consciousness of what all this means to us as a species, who Darwin is, and how much he means,” Racimo said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Finding students at the School of Public Health is an easy task—just try the cafeteria, the only significant social space on a campus already lacking cohesion.
“This is it,” said Diya Basu-Sen, a second year master’s student, gesturing at the cluster of round tables populating the carpeted cafeteria. “When they close the cafeteria for dean addresses and career fairs, there is really nowhere else for us to go.”
With 27 buildings sprinkled across the Longwood Medical Area and the greater Boston area, the School of Public Health has long outgrown its rented buildings, including a recently acquired former Chinese restaurant, leaving students with a dearth of social space and a disjointed community, according to the school’s former dean, Barry R. Bloom.
Recognizing the limitations of their scattered setting, the school began planning in 2001 for a much-heralded move to Allston—since presented as a solution to the school’s disjoint nature and lack of student space.
But a tanking economy has thrown that plan into limbo, as the University considers slowing construction in Allston to right itself following a projected 30 percent loss in endowment value for the fiscal year ending June 30.
And without the guarantee of Allston’s 20 percent increase in student space, the school has been struggling to find alternatives in the confines of their current campus, Bloom said. 
Former Mexican health minister Julio Frenk, who stepped into his role as the new dean of the Harvard School of Public Health last month, wrote in a letter to faculty and staff last week that the school would respond to the new uncertainty by leasing properties nearby, most notably an empty elementary school on Smith Street—39,000 square feet of space located a few blocks from the school’s central site in Longwood.
“With the economic environment making the pace of Allston less certain, we did not feel as though we could pass up the opportunity to lease a significant amount of space so close to our main campus,” Frenk wrote.
27 BUILDINGS
Hans-Olav Adami, who heads the epidemiology department, says he has been racking his brains to accommodate the needs of roughly 160 students—often at the expense of his full-time faculty—and bring together the department members scattered across three buildings.
“There’s absolutely nothing I can do,” Adami says, distraught. 
Most student work requires close contact with the faculty, Adami says, but there is simply no available space to facilitate these interactions.
“We cannot put people in a space that doesn’t exist,” Adami says.
Since Adami came from Sweden to chair the department two years ago, a newly created office suite for part-time faculty to meet with students has freed up some space now devoted to research and other activities.
But Adami says that he has “reached the limit” in his capacity to accommodate students and faculty in his department.
The school’s recent plans to move its administrative units into the vacant elementary school on Smith Street would free up offices in the school’s main buildings for departments struggling with the same problems.
But Adami says even an expansion in the current buildings would fail to address the feeling of disconnectedness in his department, which would still be scattered over several buildings.
“The geographic divide is severe enough to hamper the type of daily interactions and unexpected meetings and discussions,” he says.
The school’s promised central location in the massive new Allston campus was supposed to address such issues, facilitating interaction in a vibrant scientific community with close connections to the University’s other schools.
But with the state of the Harvard’s finances up in the air, University President Drew G. Faust said this week that Allston construction would likely be slowed.
Even timely completion of the first science complex—which won special approval from the City of Boston to allow completion by July 2011—now appears uncertain, causing once certain tenants to consider alternative homes in Cambridge.
And with a sometimes protracted approval process compounding the effect of any delay on the University’s part, the School of Public Health will have to wait years before any move materializes.
With Allston now a speck on the horizon, the School of Public Health is looking for temporary solutions to its space constraints.
Though recent plans to relocate all administrative units into a property on Smith Street have not yet been finalized, Dean for Administration and Operations Paul Riccardi said he expects his office to move there in approximately six to nine months.
But though Bloom praised the school’s faculty for finding stop-gap solutions, he said they could never achieve a centralized community to foster cross-departmental and interdisciplinary work in their current settings.
“What Allston has the opportunity to do for us is to bring all of our faculty and student body together to create a real campus,” Bloom said.
NO SPACE, NO PLACE
While new acquisitions may alleviate some stress on departments’ cramped quarters, student social space will remain sparse.
Second-year master’s student Basu-Sen and her peers often lounge in the cafeteria during the day between classes, whether to grab a bite to eat or to while away some time with friends. The cafeteria workers pack up the selection of food after 3:30 p.m., and students are often found studying in groups thereafter.
The cafeteria—essentially the only student space on campus—serves as a venue for almost all events, though Bloom said the school traditionally rents out space “with a real stage” at the Mass. College of Art, a two minute walk from the main campus, for the annual International Night festivities.
Demand for cafeteria use is high, said fourth year MD/MPH student Melody A. Russell, and those who try to plan large functions are often frustrated by the lack of an alternative venue.
Over the past few years, then-dean Bloom chose to renovate student facilities, including the cafeteria and computer labs, with the expectation that Allston would eventually provide a permanent solution to the campus’ limitations.
“We were absolutely happy to make [those investments],” Bloom said, “once we knew that we wouldn’t be in Allston for a while.”
The recent renovations of the cafeteria and basement computer labs were completed last summer.
The school knocked down walls to accommodate seating for more students and made the cafeteria computer-friendly with more power outlets along the walls and columns. In the basement of the same building, the computer room, which the school’s dean for administration and operations said hadn’t been renovated for several decades, now boasts brand-new equipment, including a plasma TV and computer workstations.
Though Basu-Sen said that the renovations were “nice,” she added that it is difficult to work on group assignments—the cafeteria is frequently “too loud” and the computer labs uncomfortably silent.
Bloom readily acknowledges the persisting problems.
“Student facilities are absolutely inadequate,” Bloom said, “but we’ve done the best we can.”
A 21ST CENTURY VISION
As the school’s incoming dean, Frenk recognized the challenges he faces in both finding a temporary solution to the school’s space problems and preparing for an eventual move to Allston.
In the meantime, Basu-Sen shrugged off the school’s space limitations as she returned to her Tupperware of home-made Middle Eastern food.
“You’re only here for one or two years,” Basu-Sen said, “so there isn’t too much investment in the campus.”
But Frenk said the school must continue to address the disjoint nature of the campus and the lack of student space.
“Solving the question of space is strategic not just because we need more room, but we also need a different kind of space that will encourage interaction—that will make the vision of a twenty-first century public health school possible,” Frenk said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kenneth W. Starr—the lead prosecutor of President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal—arrived at Harvard Law School yesterday night to deliver a talk on the Roberts court and its decisions on business cases, but during the course of the conversation, Starr’s controversial decision to work towards upholding Proposition 8 generated mixed views among students. Starr, a former United States solicitor general, was named as lead counsel for the official proponents of Proposition 8 last December. The California proposition, which eliminated same-sex couples’ right to marry, has remained a lightning rod of controversy since it was passed in November. While Starr did not mention his position during the course of his talk, a handout was distributed before he spoke that included a newspaper article about Starr’s appointment to the counsel, and his work on the issue came up during the question and answer session when a student asked him about it. “California has a rich tradition of progressive popularism, where people decided they could amend the constitution by popular vote,” Starr said. He did not mention why he decided to take on the case, or what his personal position was on the issue. Students had mixed reactions to Starr’s position on Proposition 8.Alexander A. Crohn, a member of Harvard of Lambda—the Law School’s gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender student group—said that Starr’s prominence may influence the outcome of the issue.  “I respect how Ken Starr follows his beliefs,” Crohn, who is a third year law student, said. But he added that Ken Starr’s choice to take on this case “gives it a lot of popularity, and an unfair advantage to upholding Proposition 8.”Sajid Sharif, a member of the Federalist Society, which was the organization that hosted Starr’s talk, disagreed.“It’s good that the people have representation and that Ken Starr has taken on this case,” he said. Another student noted that she respected Starr’s decision to stay true to his beliefs even though he has adopted many high-profile cases during the course of his career.“Christianity is a huge factor for me personally, and that he has managed to go so far while still holding onto his beliefs is very impressive,” Katheryn E. Klimko, a first year law student, said. “It was very powerful how he talked about learning to be content whatever the circumstances.” Before the question and answer session, Starr’s speech focused on the landscape of the court, and how there are growing generational gaps on the bench. He pointed out how Justice John Paul Stevens is 88 and how several other judges are in their 70s, but how John Roberts, for example, is only 53 and may potentially serve for another 30 years on the court. Starr also noted that business decisions have a tendency to unify the justices. Starr described the court as “business friendly,” and on business matters “transphilosophical and transideological.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst wrangling over potential construction slowdowns at last week’s Allston-Brighton neighborhood task force meeting, one resident asked the group to turn its attention to a specific concern: a local rat infestation that some residents say has resulted from excavation work at Harvard’s planned Allston Science Complex. 
“Are you at least going to tell us about all the rats that have come out of the hole and since infested our neighborhood?” asked Jake Carman, founder of the Allston Brighton Neighborhood Assembly, to boisterous applause. “Can you all have the Harvard Corporation and the President come down next time so we can actually find out what’s going on in our neighborhood?”
But Harvard’s director of community relations Kevin A. McCluskey ’76 said in an interview that the connection between Harvard’s excavation and the influx of rats was tenuous, and that the University employs a “very aggressive and thorough pre-construction program” that anticipated rodent displacement from the work site. He also pointed out that an explanation for the rat influx might be the failure of community members to dispose of trash properly in rat-proof garbage bins. 
But Carman said that—to his knowledge—city officials have examined the rat situation near the construction site, but have not worked in North Brighton to quell the infestation—which he says is a phenomenon that greatly increased in scale following the excavation work.  
Harvard broke ground on the science complex—its only Allston expansion initiative approved thus far—in 2008.
“I can tell you that I moved [to North Brighton] in September of 2007 and we had not a single rat on our street, we only had bunny rabbits on our streets,” Carman said. “Now it’s covered in rats. Nowadays, you can walk from my house to North Harvard Street and you’ll see 10 live rats if it’s late enough at night.”
Carman said his organization will soon send out flyers and go door-to-door in the neighborhood to discuss ways to mitigate the rat infestation. 
Gary D. Alpert, Harvard’s entomology officer of environmental health and safety, said that “the bottom line is the rats are [the community’s rats], not Harvard’s,” and that the University and city have worked to control potential rat issues both nearby the construction site and in surrounding neighborhoods. 
Alpert—who is co-leader of a project that started over a year ago to make Allston a “rat-free zone”—added that by creating outreach programs to educate community members and to provide rat-proof trash containers, Harvard has been “trying to be good neighbors” and actually “went out of [its] way” to rid a local church of rats. 
“If [residents] see rats, they should be complaining to Boston Inspectional Services,” Alpert said. 
Some Allston residents, including Task Force members Ray Mellone and John Cusack, agreed that the University and city have made a substantial effort to deal with the rat issue, and that responsible trash disposal is key.
“The University was not at fault if there was any type of infestation,” said Mellone, who added that he has not noticed a growing rat problem. “I don’t think it’s anything except sour grapes on the part of people who like to raise issues. [The complaints] are way out of proportion to what is going on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirteen pants-less students marched single-file into the Eliot House dining hall amidst cheers and whistles during the House’s “Pants-less Dining Experience” last night.
As the night progressed, Eliot House residents, some wearing colorful boxers, knee socks, American flag ties and dress socks, filtered into the hall. 
Dimitry A. Doohovsky ’09, who coordinated the event, led the queue in what he said was an opportunity for Eliot House students to bond over turkey meatloaf and grilled pepper steak.
In an e-mail sent over the House list yesterday Doohovsky wrote that “something must be done” about the crowds of non-Eliot diners that frequent the dining hall. 
“The pants-lessness is the means by which we bond and proclaim our uniqueness,” Doohvosky said.
But, if the 
purpose of the night was to discourage non-Eliot residents against eating in the dining hall, then the message was not received by some. 
A number of athletes, many who routinely have practice in the athletic facilities across the river until 7:00 p.m., said that they have no choice but to rush to Eliot before the dining halls close at 7:15 p.m.. 
“We have late practice at the boat house, and Kirkland is strict about inter-house dining, so we like Eliot,” said rower Andrew J. Stein ’12. 
Other Eliot House residents remained decidedly clothed among a bevy of their half-naked peers.
“I feel that it is rather unsanitary,” Kyle A. Martin ’11 said, adding that the group is “discriminating against non-Eliot House diners.”
However, Doohvsky maintained that the purpose of the experience is not to discriminate against anyone. 
“We are not being hostile to people—we are just being pro-Eliot,” he said. “However, we don’t particularly want people to overrun our dining hall all the time.”­­­­­
HoCo Co-Chair Alejandra Duarte ’10, who also went pants-free, said that she viewed the event as a way for Eliot House residents to proclaim their House spirit. 
“We wanted to have a community dinner so we could see who was from Eliot.” 
However, 		the stunt may succeeded in drawing  	an even larger crowd than usual to the dining hall. 
“I came here just to see the pants-less extravaganza,” Yue Han Tang ’10 said. “After this, I am going back to Currier.”
By the end of dinner, nearly half the diners were enjoying their Harvard University Dining Services fawre in their intimates. 
“This is a great turnout,” Doohvsky said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Love may be in the air for Valentine’s Day this weekend, but there certainly will not be warm feelings in the Bright Hockey Center. Tonight, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team will look to avoid a slip-up against Colgate (8-15-5, 3-10-3 ECAC). Tomorrow the Crimson (5-14-4, 5-7-4) will play one of its most anticipated games of the season as it faces off against bitter and historic rival Cornell (15-4-4, 10-3-3) in what is sure to be an intense and physical battle. In November, the Big Red escaped with a narrow 2-1 win over Harvard in Ithaca, N.Y. Tomorrow Harvard will look to avenge this loss on its home ice.  A lot has changed since the previous matchup of the two.  No. 6 Cornell climbed the national rankings and became one of the country’s elite teams, while Harvard hit a bit of a rough patch. Since the Cornell game, Harvard compiled a record of 1-11-3. The Beanpot, however, showed signs of resurgence and the Crimson’s ability to rise in rivalry games. In two thrilling contests, Harvard barely fell to No. 1 Boston University and No. 15 Boston College.Despite Harvard’s record, juniors Alex Biega and Doug Rogers has led their team with a positive attitude. “The team has to focus on the rest of the season and move on,” Biega said. “The league is so tight. Every win matters and every period matters.”   “We have a positive mindset and were able to regroup after Monday’s loss to [Boston College],” Rogers said. “[We] are pretty confident going into the game.”A win against Cornell may give the Crimson the extra motivation and confidence they need for a successful end to its season. Last year, after losing to Boston College in the Beanpot, Harvard went on a seven-game unbeaten streak. The Crimson looks for a similar boost against the Big Red this season.However, Cornell will be a formidable challenge to the Crimson. Not only does the defensive Cornell team have an impressive record, but also a highly skilled goaltender in Ben Scrivens who is ranked first nationally in save percentage and shutouts. He is also second in the country with a 1.42 goals against average.  With good reason, Cornell relies heavily on Scrivens’ ability to protect the net, and the team has gone 8-2 in games decided by two goals or less.The Crimson’s solution to Scrivens is simple. “[We plan to] play our game and get a lot of traffic in front of him,” Rogers said.  Home-ice advantage should work in favor of Harvard and boost the Crimson’s confidence.  The atmosphere surrounding the game is tremendous and intense, and tickets sold out early this week. Harvard’s big game against Cornell is definitely the anticipated contest of the weekend, but the Crimson must make sure they do not overlook tonight’s game against Colgate. Even though Cornell may be the game the fans are preparing for, the Crimson has prepared sufficiently to tackle Colgate, the first obstacle this weekend.  “Our immediate focus is on Friday’s night game to make a step in the right direction,” Rogers said.The Raiders have not experienced an ideal season, but the Crimson is not taking them for granted.“Any team can come out and beat a team on a given night,” Biega said.To prepare for the quickness and speed of transition the Raiders possess, Harvard has put a real focus on the power play during practices.“Special teams are a make-or-break part of the game,” Biega said.While the rivalry between Harvard and Colgate is not at the same level as the one with Cornell, the game is still enormously important.  It sets the tone for the rest of the weekend as well as the rest of the season.  The Crimson, taking each game at a time, has a focused goal for the remainder of the season: “to be the best team we can be and roll into league playoffs playing the best hockey we can,” Rogers said.
