After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Drake broke records with “Views,” his previous album—it reached more than a billion streams on Apple Music alone, and was streamed a whopping 245.1 million times in just the week after it was released—but the project itself was undeserving of its many accolades. A tedious, overlong mess of a project, “Views” did not set the bar high for his next project—but thank God, “More Life,” his seventh studio project, does not disappoint. Far less hyped up—physical copies have yet to be released, the project wasn’t announced until the day before it was dropped, and a Saturday release is atypical for the music industry—“More Life,” with its less in-your-face promotion, is a surprising success. Drake calls “More Life” a playlist instead of an album—perhaps in anticipation of fans calling out an incoherence they saw in “Views”—and subsequently passes the reins over to the artists, who let Drake sit back and enjoy the show.
“More Life” succeeds where “Views” fails. That 2016 album, in which his sound deteriorates into a commercialized, forced, and unimaginative attempt at the hip hop/pop genre that Drake still managed to dominate with mediocre songs was Drake’s unsuccessful claim to the “artiste” title he worked so hard to earn in previous albums. (Let’s hope “Hotline Bling” was successful because it is undeniable proof that Drake had fallen, a possibility so terrifying that fans had to play the song on repeat to believe it themselves, rather than the much more disappointing probability that people actually liked it.) This playlist, however, affirms Drake’s place among the greats in contemporary music.
Drake made the best decision he could have when he allowed other artists to take control of certain songs on “More Life”: By giving others more artistic freedom over the playlist, Drake avoids over-saturating his music with his own miserable self—again. Though “More Life” is even longer than “Views”—22 tracks—the regular input from other artists keeps the playlist fresh. In “No Long Talk,” Drake allotts himself only one verse, ceding the rest of the song to UK rapper Griggs; “4422” is a mournful plea sung entirely by English artist Sampha; Kanye’s production genius shines in the collaboration “Glow,” sampled from Earth, Wind & Fire’s 1974 classic “Devotion.” These concessions put less pressure on Drake to impress, expose his fans to newer artists they may not know, and create a consistency in its diversity, benefits that were noticeably absent from “Views.”
That’s not to say that “More Life” is radically different from “Views.” On the contrary, Drake continues adopting beats from other cultures, specifically Jamaican and Caribbean, as he did with “One Dance” and “Controlla.” “Mabida Riddim”—“riddim” is Jamaican patois for “rhythm”—has a similarly dancehall-inspired beat. “Blem,” itself a Jamaican-inspired slang word, continues in that vein. Most notable is his constant use of slang throughout the project. When other singers aren’t taking the lead, Drake often defers to patois, especially in his song titles, solidifying his place at the forefront of infusing different style and cultures into one sound. The trap beat underlying “Ice Melts” and the multiple features from UK rappers only emphasize his dedication to encompassing a wide spectrum of music and further blur the lines between hip hop and pop.
Drake continues to lament throughout the album, but his transparency and refusal to hide behind any musical pomp imbues his self-pity with an authenticity it previously lacked. Drake subtly evokes his drama-filled love life in “Teenage Fever,” which features former girlfriend Jennifer Lopez’s hit single “If You Had My Love”; but JLo is noticeably absent from “Get It Together,” on which she also supposedly sung. “Mabida Riddim” explores Drake’s continued disillusionment with the industry and his so-called “friends”: “I cannot tell who is my friend / I need distance between me and them / Gonna have to teach me how to love you again / God knows I’m trying.” In “Can’t Have Everything,” Drake reveals his struggle with wanting everything but not being able to have it. He “want a lot, can’t have everything / Can’t have everything / Want a lot, can’t have everything / But I want everything.” This issues are both conceited and unexceptional, but are so quintessentially Drake that you can’t help but feel for him.
As the album tapers off in “Do Not Disturb,” Drake croons that he is “Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery / Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me / I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary,” hinting at a subsequent silence that is unusual for the prolific artist. Time may help get Drake officially back on track, musically speaking, and avoid burning out—especially considering the few projects by Drake and collaborators rumored to also be coming out this year. In a new business move, Drake could be priming us for his next project by not being constantly at the forefront of the musical conversation, but instead disappearing for a while to come back even harder. Whether he sticks to his word remains to be seen, but we can all rest easy knowing that Drake has finally returned to form.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, March 27, dozens of fans packed into the Harvard Book Store to see writer and illustrator Michael DeForge give a presentation on his newly released graphic novel, “Sticks Angelica, Folk Hero.” The event consisted of a comic book reading, a musical performance from guest Sadie Dupuis, and a question-and-answer session.
DeForge kicked off the presentation by reading a couple of short comics from his past work. The author’s signature style, most notably his snappy writing, sexually explicit subject matter, and simplistic drawings, was on display in all the comics he shared with the audience. DeForge intentionally read his creatively uncomfortable yet funny work in a quick, emotionless manner, eliciting roars of laughter from the audience members.
Dupuis followed up DeForge’s readings with a few poems and songs. The poems, which were abstract, complex, and relatable, had people in the audience bowing their heads down in deep thought. Dupuis’ music was more thoughtful and reflective, a nice contrast to DeForge’s more lighthearted work.
DeForge wrapped up the presentation by taking questions from his fans in the audience and revealing a bit about his work behind the scenes. He wakes up early every day and goes to sleep pretty late, after he finishes all of his work. Since he is currently a designer on Cartoon Network’s “Adventure Time,” his schedule is always busy. He writes comics on the side, seeing them more as passion projects. “I don’t write with an audience in mind, except for different versions of myself,” he said. “It’s weird to think about what other people like, and there would be too many audiences to try and satisfy.” This is perfectly all right for DeForge, because he doesn’t have to worry about his comics making money—that comes from his work on “Adventure Time.” “My ‘Adventure Time’ job ends in three days, so that’ll become a problem soon,” he joked.
DeForge says he typically doesn’t have a set process for writing and illustrating his comics. He usually writes and draws at the same time, putting down whatever comes to his mind. Much of DeForge’s work is inspired by his interests. “I think biology and world-building is really fun … It’s why you see a lot of forests in my comics.” His work is also inspired by his past. “I feel like if I keep on readdressing these key moments in my life, then when I die, my work will have a fuller picture of what I was trying to convey about my life,” he said. DeForge is cautious about these recurring ideas, though. He is very careful about walking the fine line between having consistent themes in all his work and simply being repetitive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a University-wide event last week, the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging unveiled its future plans to promote inclusivity, one of which involves revising the 181-year-old Harvard alma mater, “Fair Harvard.” The committee has created a contest for all University affiliates to modernize the song—achieved by changing the last line, which currently reads “Till the stock of the Puritans die”—and by soliciting a new arrangement to the song itself, citing the precedent of the musical “Hamilton.” While we support the intention behind this well-meaning effort, we do not view the lyrics revision as helpful or useful in working towards greater inclusivity.
This is not the first time inclusion has been used as a reason to revise the alma mater; in 1998, the first line was changed to be gender-neutral. In this case, however, as anachronistic as the lyric may seem, this adjustment does very little to address the real concerns many students have about belonging at Harvard. We fail to see how this proposed change will be significant to the mission of the Task Force and the University at large.
Students do not engage with the alma mater on a regular basis. By contrast, other renamed or changed traditions involved phrases like “House Master” (a change we opposed) which were used regularly. Indeed, the line in question has not been a source of consternation among students. In our view, the proposed change merely serves as a token that will ultimately achieve little in the greater scope of issues that plague Harvard College.
It's not all bad: We're hopeful that, while this change may have been misguided, the overall effort might have the unexpected effect of re-engaging students with tradition. The contest to compose an alternative arrangement might provide students with the chance to interact with Harvard’s centuries-old rituals in new and innovative ways, allowing old Harvard to mix with the new. We hope it will succeed in this respect—allowing current students to approach Harvard’s history through new contexts—even if the updated lyrics are of little significance.
Inclusivity is a broad, multifaceted topic that must be approached at Harvard in numerous and sophisticated ways. Despite the best efforts of the administration, inequities continue to exist. Issues that deeply affect both students and faculty on this campus, such as the lack of a bridge program, an ethnic studies area of study, and a diverse faculty, cannot be solved by changing a two-centuries-old song. We ask for concrete solutions, not token modifications. We hope the University and the Task Force refocus on addressing ongoing issues that more genuinely affect the well-being of many students on this campus in order to achieve a more equitable Harvard.

Last fall President Faust launched a University-wide Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. President Faust asked Archon Fung (Ford Foundation Professor of Democracy and Citizenship at the Kennedy School of Government), Meredith Weenick (vice president for campus services), and me to chair the Task Force. Fifty additional members of the campus community are serving alongside us. We represent all the schools on campus, central administration, and all three constituencies: students, staff, and academic personnel. We have a wide array of backgrounds, experiences, identities, religious affiliations, and viewpoints.
President Faust gave us the charge of working to understand how this campus can facilitate, for people of all backgrounds, identities, and viewpoints, the experiences of belonging necessary to support academic and professional thriving. We seek to understand how the University can anchor values of inclusion and belonging, execute on those values, and also help each school do the same.
What exactly are the values of inclusion and belonging? As President Faust has written, “Diversity is not an incidental concern for Harvard; it is fundamental to Harvard’s mission and identity.” Education in contexts of diversity “fosters creativity, challenges settled assumptions, and helps make possible the advancement of knowledge central to our mission.”
Yet it is not enough merely to open a campus to people of all backgrounds and to recruit from a multiplicity of places. Each of us who comes to Harvard to learn, work, teach, and conduct research brings academic and professional aspirations. Social, academic, and professional isolation are hindrances to fulfilling those aspirations. If the campus can’t support the flourishing of all, we make good neither on the promise of diversity nor on the promises made to each new member of the community.
The goal of the Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging is to clarify the obstacles that currently exist on our campus to experiences of inclusion and belonging. The Task Force seeks to identify barriers to academic, professional, and social integration. And the Task Force seeks solutions for these.
Over the fall and winter, the Task Force has been holding listening sessions throughout campus, which also will continue throughout the spring. Last week, we sponsored an Afternoon of Engagement in Sanders Theater open to the whole University community.
As part of that event, the Task Force made two important announcements.
First, we launched an online tool, the Solution Space, so that those unable to attend an on-campus listening session can share thoughts and ideas. We invite you to participate in the conversation through this tool.
Second, we announced a competition to revise the final line of the alma mater and to create a supplementary musical variant for the alma mater, a second mode of performing it that would help expand the campus’ symbolic repertoire. The music you all know and love would continue to be the official alma mater music but a second approach to performance would also be available for use. All genres are welcome—from traditional choral music to hip hop and spoken word and electronic music.
The alma mater was revised in 1998 in order to achieve gender inclusivity. It is a living symbol used to welcome each incoming College class and to celebrate the conclusion of their journey at Commencement. The current conclusion suggests that the commitment to truth, and to being the bearer of its light, is the special province of those of Puritan stock. This is false. We therefore launch this competition in the interests of truth itself. We launch it also in order to affirm that Harvard’s motto, “Veritas,” speaks to and on behalf of all members of our community, regardless of background, identity, religious affiliation, or viewpoint.
With this competition, the Task Force affirms Harvard’s traditions while also engaging the creativity of the University community in refashioning them for the 21st century. The Task Force invites you to join us in this creative journey and to share your thoughts.
Danielle S. Allen is the James Bryant Conant University Professor and Director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The history of American democracy is a history of imperfection. From the moment the Declaration of Independence declared universal equality to be a self-evident truth, American ideals have existed in tension with the realities of power. American victory in the Revolution meant disaster for slaves who had responded to British promises of freedom. The North’s failure to pursue Reconstruction after 1877 allowed Jim Crow to entrench itself for generations. Woodrow Wilson advocated for self-determination while segregating the federal government. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1901 and former Crimson President, interned Japanese-Americans even as they fought with their fellow citizens for the Four Freedoms in Europe and Asia. And Lyndon B. Johnson expanded access to voting rights, healthcare, and education while condemning tens of thousands of Americans and many more Vietnamese to violent deaths.
Nevertheless, the American system—domestically and globally—has, for all its manifest flaws, been a great engine of progress. At home, a federal court system that once declared white supremacy to be a cornerstone of American nationhood this month extended the Civil Rights Act to forbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Abroad, a world order of empires that fell apart twice in the space of twenty-five years has transformed itself into a collection of independent nations bound by international norms. These characterizations by no means imply that the world is without problems; rather, they suggest that the world of today is one that would arouse the envy of past generations.
Two events of the past week, however, should remind us just how fragile the institutional foundations of this progress are. First, Senate Republicans’ decision to end the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in order to confirm Neil M. Gorsuch’s appointment represents not only an escalation of growing partisanship, but also an abdication of moral authority. Judge Gorsuch’s ideology is offensive enough to the institutions that have made America strong over the past century. But what is more grating is that his confirmation will mean the success of a rank fraud perpetrated against every voter that cast a ballot for Barack Obama.
Fraud may seem like a strong term, but it accurately conveys the sophistry behind the Republicans’ sudden discovery of the so-called “Biden Rule” as they searched for reasons not to confirm Obama’s nominee, Merrick B. Garland ’74, to Antonin Scalia’s Supreme Court seat. Even if Joe Biden had suggested in one 1992 speech that Presidents should lose all Constitutional legitimacy in the final calendar year of their terms, the idea would have been absurd—and far from the first incomplete thought uttered by the former Vice President. As it happens, he did not say that, and only argued—stupidly, but far less criminally so—that Presidents should wait until after Election Day to nominate candidates for Supreme Court vacancies.
In declaring President Obama—winner of 65 million votes in 2012—illegitimate before the expiration of his term, Senate Republicans began to debase the presidency far before they supported Donald J. Trump’s elevation to that office. Such institutional malfeasance is how republics fail.
Beyond this domestic failure, the United States Congress once again looked morally bankrupt last week as Syria’s blood-soaked regime launched another chemical weapons attack against its own citizens. This moral abdication is a bipartisan one; President Obama’s inaction against Bashar al-Assad will rank with Bill Clinton’s inability to end the Rwandan Genocide as one of the great blunders in the history of American foreign relations.
And yet, for all of Obama’s culpability, once again Congress must bear a large part of the blame for the ongoing breakdown of international institutional order that has paralleled the shortcomings of the United States’ domestic political life.  Despite the principled stands of Senators like Tim Kaine, Congress has failed even to vote on military action against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, let alone on the more controversial issue of attacking Assad’s regime.
This failure to act on a major issue of foreign affairs parallels the myopia of the misbegotten Garland-Gorsuch saga. In this case, Congressional inaction has thrown the public’s role in approving military action into doubt and allowed American strategy to dither as a state collapses and American allies like Jordan confront the resulting humanitarian crisis. The only firm statements of American policy have been ever more indefensible attempts to abandon and ignore the victims of U.S. inaction.
At the time of writing, the Trump administration’s missile strikes against a Syrian Air Force base may represent a more decisive turn in American policy. Without a clear strategy and explicit Congressional approval, however, these attacks will only represent another isolated and constitutionally suspect action by an incompetent administration. Moreover, this response comes only after the President gave carte blanche to dictators everywhere by explicitly reneging on American commitments to human rights.
Taken together, the Gorsuch and Syrian affairs represent institutional stagnation that ought to cause profound discomfiture. American ideals are only as strong as the moral fortitude of the institutions that uphold them. When Congress fails its own citizens and the hopes of people around the world—as it has this past week—it echoes the worst moments of the American experience. Justice and war are the two most fundamental concerns of government. When our representatives do not concern themselves with either, we ought to worry.

At Harvard you are, in many ways, at home. You form routines: waking up at the same time, eating in the dining hall, and studying for classes in particular spots. You begin to recognize the same people walking to classes on the same pathways. You become comfortable with friends, and even with people you don’t particularly like but who have become woven into the fabric of your time here. You begin to be comforted by simple things—red bricks with white trimmings, bells ringing on the hour, strange radiator noises, that section kid’s questions—so subtly you don’t even realize you’re being comforted until they’re gone.
Studying abroad changes that.
“I got really homesick,” said Aubrey Stoddard ’17. “I was in India, I dealt with some sickness, and I was lying in bed, and my host brother didn’t speak English. I just wanted to call my mom and [have her] make me soup, and food, and make me feel better. But the next day my host mom made me tomato soup and mac and cheese because she knew they were American comfort foods.” Abroad, you are in a place completely different from your home, until it slowly becomes part of your heart. As you begin to settle down into routines and become as comfortable in a strange place as you are in Cambridge, you begin to wonder what “home” is.
Besides the questions of comfort and homesickness, there are those of belonging, engagement, and privilege. It is an incredible privilege to be able to even go to another country that is different from yours for a little while. Is it possible to claim any sort of belonging when you were not raised with the history of a place; when your family at home makes more in a month than your host family makes in a year, as I felt in Morocco? How do you engage with difficult cultural issues in this place where you just arrived a few months ago, where blackface is still an acceptable form of humor, as Austin Mueller ’17 found in Cuba? Or a place where women are routinely harassed on the street (something that has come up in multiple conversations with students who have gone abroad)?
I don’t have the answer to these questions, but I do believe that some degree of space is necessary: you never will belong, and you should be aware of your levels of privilege as a foreign student studying there. But at the same time, cultures are not monolithic, and as an outsider embedded in the culture, it is possible, and sometimes even necessary, to engage in conversations and debates about cultural differences. I was frustrated in Morocco when other American students would say “you can’t criticize the culture” on sexual harassment, in part because a discussion on the universality of some values was necessary, and in part because I felt an unwillingness to engage or criticize this status quo devalued the perspectives of the many, many Moroccan women who hated street harassment and wanted it to end.
Studying abroad forces you to turn a critical lens on your own culture and history. When I returned from Morocco, I thought I would be grateful to never be harassed on the street—instead, I saw more clearly how the same insidious ideas about women exist in both subtle and unsubtle ways in the United States. I was both angry at, and proud of, the United States in a way that I never had been before, because I realized how expansive (literally and figuratively) it was. Studying abroad spurred me to take courses on African-American literature and Native American history this semester, in which I’ve had to engage with the pre-European and racial aspects of our society and realized how little I truly know about the country I have called home for 15 years.
Study abroad creates homes without ownership, and comfort without belonging. Many of us at Harvard were raised in different places and across cultures, but at least here, we have some modicum of ownership, belonging, understanding, and being at peace. Study abroad is more bittersweet; it creates another place your heart longs for, but whose culture you will never really understand and to which you will never belong. The place will go on, changing, becoming more luminous, just as it had changed in the years before you ever lived there, and in ways more complex than you could ever understand.
Being abroad and returning, one must adopt a moveable definition of home, different from the definition with which one began. Feeling at home at Harvard might consist of routines, or belonging, or being able to completely understand the culture, or being comfortable. Feeling at home abroad might consist of only a few of these things, and also in being comfortable with always being a bit on the outside. You cannot engage with all of your homes in the same way, but the way you engage with all of them informs the way you engage with the rest. The one constant is that home, wherever it is, is love.
“Home can mean so many things,” Stoddard said. “Anyone who cares about you and loves you can be your home.”

Neil M. Gorsuch became the 113th justice of the United States Supreme Court after the Senate confirmed him Friday, joining five other Harvard Law School attendees on the nation’s highest legal body.
Gorsuch, who graduated from the Law School in 1991, was confirmed by a vote of 54-45 after weeks of tension in the Senate. President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch to the Court in late January, and his Senate confirmation hearings began in March.
Last week, Senate Democrats filibustered Gorsuch’s confirmation, aiming to block the vote by denying him the 60 votes necessary to move forward to a confirmation vote. Senate Republicans, invoking the so-called “nuclear option,” then changed their voting rules to require only a simple majority to break the filibuster.
The justice’s nomination came a year after his predecessor Antonin G. Scalia died in February 2016, leaving a vacancy on the Court. Former president Barack Obama nominated Merrick B. Garland ’74—a Harvard College and Law School graduate—to the Court last year, but Senate Republicans refused to hold confirmation hearings, arguing the next president should select the justice to replace Scalia.
Gorsuch, widely known as a conservative respected across the aisle, is expected to maintain a similar judicial philosophy to Scalia, who advocated a strict reading of the U.S. Constitution.
Gorsuch’s views on controversial issues the court is likely to hear cases on, such as abortion, are unclear, and his Senate hearings did little to clarify his stance. However, he is expected to take a traditionally conservative stance on most issues.
After Trump attacked a federal judge for blocking one of his controversial immigration executive orders last month, Gorsuch condemned Trump’s accusations, which some signaled the justice’s independence from the Trump administration.

Dozens of student activists, including some from Harvard, rallied at the Boston Common Friday to call for a stronger coalition among Boston-area activist groups and to voice concerns over the current state of politics.
The rally, titled “Youth Action March—Boston” offered platforms to speakers from organizations like Planned Parenthood and Boston Mobilization, as well as student groups including the Harvard College Democrats. In the remarks, many speakers aimed to promote their upcoming events, recruit new members, and plan joint efforts between the groups present.
Reed T. Shafer-Ray ’18, legislative director of the Harvard College Democrats, spoke about the need for stricter gun control regulations and called for support on the club’s efforts to lobby for such bills.
“The Harvard Dems worked on four bills, three of which are on gun control. The bills were inspired by an incident where a close family friend of mine was able to buy a gun and shoot himself,” Shafer-Ray said. “The family pleaded the stores to not sell him the gun, but legally the store had to sell it to him. This can’t be acceptable to anyone who cares about justice.”
Another speaker, Scott Kall ’20, who co-founded the activist network Millennials in Action, talked about the importance of youth involvement in the political process.
“As a generation, I know we have a long way to go. We can no longer sit quietly on the sidelines. We must take action. So volunteer with an advocacy group. Vote in your local elections,” he said.
The list of speakers also included Nadya T. Okamoto ’20, co-founder of nonprofit start-up PERIOD and candidate for a position on the Cambridge City Council. Okamoto explained how her background prompted a passion for public service.
The event ended with participants calling to leave voicemails to U.S. Representative Thomas J. Cole of Oklahoma, who sits on the House Appropriations and Budget Committees, urging the representative to oppose proposed bills to cut funding for public schools and college tuition loan programs for low-income families.
Matthew T. Summers, one of the organizers of the event, said he was pleased with the turnout to the rally and that he believed the gathering “bridged the divide between people who want to get active and organizations that need people desperately.”

UPDATED: April 10, 2017 at 1:46 a.m.
Six students have joined the committee tasked with reevaluating the current policy regarding single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations.
Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, former UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, Caroline M. Tervo ’18, Shub Chhokra ’18, Mo Y. Kim ’18, and Kacey Gill ’20 are now members of the committee, according to an email from Associate Dean of Students David R. Friedrich.
Several of the students named to the committee have previously voiced opinions on the College’s policy. Sachee, a member of the all-female Bee Club, lambasted the sanctions as a “one-size-fits-all policy” that “gets rid of women’s spaces on campus” at a debate during her campaign for UC in November. Banks, conversely, told the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in November that he believes the policy will help address discrimination on campus. And Tervo spoke at a rally of women’s social groups shortly after the policy was announced, where she praised all-female organizations as “crucial sources of empowerment.”
Gill is an active Crimson editorial editor, Chhokra an inactive Crimson editorial editor, and Tervo a former Crimson columnist.
First announced in January by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana,  the committee could potentially “revise or replace” the College’s policy—which, starting with the class of 2021, will forbid members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding club leadership positions and athletic team captaincies, and being recommended for several post-graduate fellowships.
The formation of the committee followed months of heated Faculty debate about the sanctions, with some faculty members arguing that they had not been adequately consulted in the formulation of the policy, a charge FAS Dean Michael D. Smith deemed “categorically false”. Several faculty members, led by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, championed a motion aiming overturn the sanctions entirely, though Lewis withdrew the motion after the announcement of the “revise or replace” committee.
Smith announced the faculty and staff members on the committee in March, although he later said in an interview that the list was incomplete.
The committee has met once, according to its co-chair Suzannah Clark, a music professor. The committee tentatively plans to present its findings in the fall of 2017, according to Smith.
“I always, with any one of these committees, put a date on it in which we would like to see reports or recommendations coming out of them, but a lot depends on what happens within the committees themselves,” Smith said in an interview Friday.
At Tuesday’s Faculty meeting, some professors questioned the ability of Khurana, a co-chair of the committee, to remain impartial as the group discusses the potential revision or replacement of a policy he crafted. Smith, who selected the co-chairs, defended Khurana and said he believes Khurana has the ability to be “open-minded.”

The Advising Programs Office has recognized 12 academic advisers at the College for providing students “exemplary intellectual and personal guidance” in the sixth year of the Star Family Prizes for Excellence in Advising.
Established by alumnus James A. Star ’83, the Star Family Prizes for Excellence in Advising annually lauds three advisers in each of four categories: freshman, sophomore, concentration, and faculty advising.
In early February, the Advising Programs Office sent emails to undergraduates inviting students to nominate their advisers. The nomination process involved completing an application with short questions about their advising experiences.
Many of the prize-winners, who range from formal advisers to instructors who advise in an informal setting, said they were grateful that their advisees feel academically supported.
Morgan D. Price ’20 nominated Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, praising him for his individualized approach to advising.
“I think it is really interesting that he advisees each of us on an individual basis so we’ll talk about how classes are going, how life is going and there's not a set line of you are all doing this or you are all doing well,” Price said.
Thomas said he strives to encourage students students to try new things and discover their own academic interests.
Other award-winning advisers, like Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Stephanie H. Kenen, emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
“One of  biggest things about coming to Harvard is that it is a very intense peer culture. And helping students to stay focused on who they are and what they are interested in and the kinds of things that they as individuals need to try,” Kenen said.
“A lot of the advice I try to give students in the first year is to definitely keep exploring that side of your identities and think about ways to keep yourself sane and healthy,” agreed freshman adviser and proctor Jonathan L. Rossi.
Some advisers fondly reflected on their experience advising students and said they saw their advising roles extending beyond purely academics.
“I really work to keep in mind that our interaction with the student, between myself and that student, is not just about class,” Jerusha T. Achterberg, an Expos preceptor, said. “It’s easy to act as though when we are in class you only talk about class things but all of us, all people, have other things going on in their lives.”
This year’s freshman advising award winners are Kenen, Rossi, and Thomas.
Sophomore advising award winners are History and Literature Lecturer Lauren Brandt, Cabot House Tutor Bethany Kibler, and Mather House Tutor Naseem Surhio.
Concentration advising award winners are Allston Burr Assistant Dean of Lowell House Caitlin Casey, Preceptor in Chemistry and Chemical Biology Grace Ferris, and Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Professor in Contemporary Islamic Thought and Life Malika Zeghal.
Faculty advising award winners are Achterberg, Computer Science professor Eddie Kohler, and History professor Emma Rothschild.
The winners will be honored at the award ceremony in May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Clover Food Lab will replace Greenhouse Cafe in the Science Center’s partially-renovated Cabot Science Library.
While the redesigned library opens Monday, the new location for Clover, a local chain restaurant specializing in vegetarian sandwiches and sides, has yet to open its doors. Clover’s Science Center location will join a Mass. Avenue storefront, and will be the company's thirteenth location.
The newly-opened library also features a coffee bar—which was operational Monday—along with “diner-style study booths, flat-screen TVs, multiple social collaboration spaces, and a new ‘Discovery Bar’” what will host a variety of programs, according to a press release from the University. A redesigned and more easily-accessible courtyard also features prominently in the new renovation.
“The now transparent and open architecture at Cabot Library recognizes a thoughtful evolution of learning and teaching that is more social and collective,” said Mack Scogin, an architecture professor at the Graduate School of Design and the project’s designer, in the press release. “It is a hybrid learning experience arising from both the classroom and the library that sacrifices none of the intensity of either.”
The renovation is in line with Harvard’s Common Spaces Initiative, a program launched in 2008 that aims to create areas for collaboration, according to the press release. The library now features two new media studios, seven group study rooms with writable walls, and, for the first time, undergraduates will be able to reserve rooms.
“The College hopes this new space can foster student-led programming such as social events, support creative collaborations with library staff, and serve as an environment in which students can connect informally with their peers, faculty, and staff,” said David R. Friedrich, associate dean of students, in the press release.
Plans for the renovation of the Cabot Science Library were announced in 2013 and it has been closed since May of 2016 for construction. Those who frequent the Science Center have seen the walls come down this semester, revealing extensive glass panelling.
Clover’s new location in the Science Center is the latest development in a sometimes-fraught relationship between Harvard and the local eatery. Just last year, Harvard forced Clover from the Smith Campus Center as renovations on the Center began. According to Clover CEO Ayr Muir, Harvard asked the business not to speak about the involuntary move.
The addition of Clover also marks a move from the HUDS-operated Greenhouse Cafe to a privately owned business. But this is not the first time a restaurant chain has occupied space in the Science Center: About twenty years ago, fast food chain Chick-fil-A occupied part of Greenhouse Cafe. The chicken sandwich shop was removed in 2003 following a renovation, much to the chagrin of some students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch ’81 reflected on her nearly two years leading the U.S. Department of Justice at the Institute of Politics Friday, urging her successors to put the interests of the American people before partisan or personal preoccupations.
Lynch replaced Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in April 2015 after being nominated by then-President Barack Obama in 2014. In November 2016, President Donald Trump nominated Senator Jeff Sessions to the position; he succeeded Lynch in February.
Speaking at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, Lynch expressed concerns about the political discourse in America and admonished today’s political leaders.
“It has become extremely hard for us to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes, because the examples of leadership we are seeing today are not doing that either,” Lynch said. “We’re in a situation now where not only are we not able to talk to each other, but the country is very divided.”
Lynch’s discussion was wide-ranging.
At one point, Lynch addressed an incident over the summer when she met with former President Bill Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. Lynch came under fire for the meeting, with critics arguing that she should not have met with the husband of president candidate Hillary Clinton, whom was under Department of Justice investigation. Lynch called the meeting with Bill Clinton a “very public mistake.”
At other times during her appearance at the IOP, Lynch took a more personal tone, discussing her own experience as a lawyer and imparting wisdom other entering the legal profession.
“I actually helped a woman obtain a divorce… and she was the happiest client I ever had,” Lynch said to laughter from the audience.
Lynch also spoke about her time as an undergraduate at Harvard. Lynch attended the College and graduated from the Law School in 1984.
“What I would say to the students here is to try a variety of things as well… there are so many things to explore that you might not have thought you would be interested in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council signed a letter of support for a summer program for low-income and first generation students at its general meeting Sunday after members debated specifics of the letter’s language.
Last month, Khurana rejected a proposal calling  for a brief freshman pre-orientation program to help low-income students adjust to Harvard. That decision has been controversial among some students and several members of the UC.
The UC's letter originally included language condemning Khurana’s rejection of the program. Specifically, some UC representatives took issue with a phrase that said Khurana’s decision “conflicts with our community’s core values.”
UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said he thought it would be inappropriate to censure Khurana when his intent behind the rejection was not clear.
“It’s just inappropriate to me to say he’s acting against the mission of the College, even though to us it may be perceived that way, we don’t know that to be true and I don’t think we should accuse people of acting in such a way,” Khansarinia said.
Khansarinia and Winthrop House representative Vimal S. Konduri '17, an inactive Crimson editor, requested an amendment to the letter that struck the phrase “conflicts with our community’s core values” from the letter and replaced it with language stressing the UC’s “disappointment in the rejection.”
However, UC Rules Chair and Winthrop representative Evan M. Bonsall '19 said he believed a letter of support needed to push back more strongly against the administration.
“I think that if we want change to happen on this campus, especially if it’s change that has to happen as a result of administrative action, that it’s important for us to actually say something,” he said.
Meanwhile, Crimson Yard representative Nadine M. Khoury ’20 said she believes that if the Council hopes to work with Khurana to create a summer bridge program, the body is better off not provoking College administrators.
“If we want a bridge program, it’s going to happen through us collaborating with the administration,” she said.
UC members also debated about whether or not to include a reference to data from a similar program at Yale in the letter. The letter initially stated that “Summer Bridge Programs at many of our peer institutions have demonstrated both their value and efficacy.” It subsequently included a link to data that claimed program participants had higher GPAs, but representatives were uncertain about the data’s reliability.
Lowell House representative Benjamin F. Molin ’18, who supported the letter, said the data point was not sufficient proof for the summer bridge programs’ effectiveness.
“It’s super important to keep good data in your argument, but the worst thing you can do is try to draw data that’s not good. I mean that just makes you look sloppy and unprepared,” he said.
After much debate, Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18—a vocal supporter of the bridge program who helped draft the letter—proposed an amendment to the letter by restructuring the sentence, deleting “efficacy,” and adding “importance.” Additionally, Gonzalez’s amendment removed the data reference.
“I am no expert when it comes to evaluating data or really being able to vet that particular source, and I would much rather present something that I’m 100 percent comfortable with,” he said.
Both amendments ultimately passed and the UC is planning on releasing the full letter soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, when the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging announced that it would hold a competition to replace “Till the stock of the Puritans die” in Harvard’s alma mater, it set its sights high.
The latest in a series of initiatives to address some of Harvard’s historic symbols, the new lyrics would “affirm that Harvard’s motto, Veritas, speaks to and on behalf of all members of our community, regardless of background, identity, religious affiliation, or viewpoint.”
With the lofty goals came national attention; The New York Times wrote that the University was affirming “its commitment to inclusion,” while a Fox News segment harshly criticized the change as the latest example of ridiculous symbolic changes at higher education institutions.
But for some Harvard students, the change is largely inconsequential. More than a dozen students contacted for this story said they were not at all familiar with the lyrics to “Fair Harvard” or the competition to replace the words in the final line.
“People don’t really know about it,” said Anna Mazur ’20.
Performed during Freshmen Convocation and Commencement ceremonies, “Fair Harvard” is not a major part of student life at the College, and some students said they were not particularly affected by the change.
Aren G. Rendell ’19 said he “did not know this was happening,” but that the change did not strike him as particularly objectionable.
“I think the institution is no longer a Puritan one per se, so I see the reasoning behind the change. I’m neither for nor against it at this point,” he said.
Others, however, were critical of the University’s decision to change the lyrics of the song. Jonathan S. Roberts ’17 said that Harvard should be focusing on more concrete measures, like offering a pre-orientation program for first generation and low-income students, to make the University more inclusive. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana recently rejected such a program.
“It feels very contradictory,” he said. “It’s very hard to believe that the College cares more than nominally about inclusivity and belonging on campus when we’re rejecting a first-gen program.”
“Changing the name of a song does very little to impact my experience here,” Roberts added.
Emily M. Hall ’18, who denounced the change during a Fox News segment, also said Harvard should be focusing its energy on different topics.
“I think that Harvard has so many more important things that it could be focusing its resources on,” she said. “I’m not sure why it has decided that this is so important.”
To be sure, the committee will take on more than just song lyrics. In September, University President Drew G. Faust charged the committee with investigating four areas of life at Harvard: demographics of faculty, staff, and students across the University, the “fabric of the institution” and its cultures, academic resources for students, and diversity groups at Harvard.
At a Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting in March, chair of the committee Danielle Allen, a government professor, said that the group was just beginning its work. In an op-ed published in The Crimson Sunday, Allen announced an online tool—called the “Solution Space”—that allows Harvard affiliates to submit ideas for “advancing Harvard toward inclusion” and upvote others’ “solutions.”
“We’ve been working to diagnose obstacles to academic, and social integration. Most importantly, though, we call upon the wisdom of our colleagues throughout the campus,” Allen said at the meeting. “Soon the task force will pivot from the discovery phase to developing solutions. At the moment, the focus is very much still on listening and discovery.”
In an email, Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 wrote that he supported the change, adding Harvard changed the lyrics in 1998 to replace the word “sons” in the lyrics.
“If all students are meant to take pride in this song, it should reflect all of them,” Gonzales wrote.
Alex Z. Zhang ’20, who is “personally not that aware of the history” of the song, also said he could see potential benefits and drawbacks to Harvard’s decision to change the lyrics.
“I think adhering too strongly to ideas of symbolism and adhering too strongly to tradition is harmful,” he said.
Harvard affiliates will be able to submit ideas for new lyrics to “Fair Harvard” on the task force’s website through September. The task force will announce winners of the competition in spring 2018.

As Harvard’s Title IX Office splits into two separate offices in response to “community feedback” about the University’s response to sexual assault on campus, some student activists and professors question whether that change will lead to substantive improvements.
Under the new system, Bill D. McCants will lead the Office of Dispute Resolution. While McCants will oversee investigations into sexual harassment complaints, Nicole M. Merhill—who took the helm of the Title IX Office last week—will work on education and providing support for those who have experience sexual assault.
Before, the Title IX Officer oversaw both educational efforts and adjudication processes for complaints. The change aims to relieve some of the administrative burden on the Title IX Officer and allow that office to focus more on training and sexual assault prevention efforts.
“This is a change being made in response to feedback from the community and a desire to enable the Title IX Office to expand its menu of trainings and educational opportunities across the University,”  Vice Provost Peggy Newell said in a statement.
But some students and professors say that the changes appear to be more symbolic than substantive. While the reform separates the Title IX office and ODR in name and function, their staffs share a space and both McCants and Merhill report to Newell.
“In many ways, it seems to be more about optics than about function,” said Katherine Leung, a third-year Law student and co-president of the Harassment Assault Law-Student Team.
Concerns about the separation between different stages of Harvard’s response to sexual assault complaints are not new. In 2014, 28 Law professors sharply criticized the University-wide Title IX procedures when they took effect, arguing in an op-ed in the Boston Globe that these procedures put “the functions of investigation, prosecution, fact-finding, and appellate review in one office.”
Law professor Janet Halley, who signed the letter, called the new structure “window dressing.”
“It does not provide either neutrality or independence of decision-makers handling particular cases,” Halley said. “The Law School procedures show how to do that, and at some point the University is going to need to move to a structure like those."
The Law School eventually adopted its own set of procedures for handling Title IX complaints, granting investigative power to an independent investigator, allowing parties to request a hearing in front of an outside adjudicator, and directing appeals to faculty on its Administrative Board.
Before last week, the Title IX Office oversaw both the investigative and appeals processes for the rest of the University. Under the new central structure, McCants will head the investigative arm under ODR, and Merhill will appoint faculty members and administrators from a standing committee to hear appeals.
Still, McCants and Merhill are Harvard employees, not third-party actors, who report to the same central administrator. With the same set of administrators retaining oversight of adjudication and appeals, Law professors and activists alike worry that these processes may not be impartial.
“From our end, what we’re really concerned about is the experience of survivors, and what survivors basically tell us is that there really is no opportunity to appeal if you feel that the Title IX Office has mishandled your case,” Jessica R. Fournier ’17, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said. “This is a step forward, but there needs to be an effort to create a really independent appeals process.”
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement that the University’s process promotes neutrality.
“From the outset, the Title IX Office and ODR have been committed to neutrality and thoroughness in investigations, as informed by the federal and state laws and Harvard community values that underlie our Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and Procedures,” DeLuzuriaga wrote.
A University committee led by former interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister is currently reviewing the Title IX policy and procedures based on input from affiliates across the University. The appeals process is “among the items on their agenda for future meetings,” deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement.
Meanwhile, with her attention turned primarily to education, Merhill has pledged to complete online training modules tailored to each of Harvard’s schools by July 1.
Fournier expressed optimism about the new structure’s to improve education efforts.
“It’s a good thing insofar as hopefully now the office will not be spread so thin, as far as doing investigations and being responsible for training,” Fournier said. “I think it’s really great that the Title IX office is thinking about education and how they are going to be doing that more effectively.”
Still, activists say it is too early to determine the full impact of the changes.

Six months after Assistant Dean for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña left Harvard, the College is still searching for her replacement and will interview three finalists for the position next week.
According to Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, the national search for candidates has been ongoing since dela Peña’s departure, and the finalists will come to campus to meet with several students. O’Dair said the College hopes to hire a replacement by the beginning of the summer.
“Ideally, we’d like someone to be here this summer, but all of that is really dependent on who are final candidate is and what their schedule is,” O’Dair said.
O’Dair added that the position “generated a lot of interest.” A search committee selected the three finalists after a round of interviews with semi-finalists concluded last month.
Next week, when the finalists arrive on campus, they will meet with “campus constituents, campus partners, people who work on issues of diversity and inclusion,” according to O’Dair. She said that they will meet with a variety of officials who work to improve diversity across Harvard, and “not just within the College.”
O’Dair named the Bureau of Study Counsel, University Health Services, Counseling and Mental Health Services, and the Freshman Dean’s Office as several of the organizations who will greet candidates.
The College also aims to directly involve students in the selection process through a student forum, where finalists will meet with students and answer questions about the job.
“It’s a confidential student forum where the candidates will present a little bit about their philosophy around diversity and inclusion and will engage with students about who they are,” O’Dair said.
The forum will consist of recommended students and the President and Vice President of the Undergraduate Council. According to O’Dair, Diversity Peer Educators and interns from the Harvard Foundation, Women’s Center, and Office of BGLTQ Student Life will also participate in the forum.
In the future, O’Dair stated that she would like to see increased diversity and inclusion efforts engaging with “a wide variety of issues” that are relevant both at Harvard and across the United States.
“[Students are] looking at candidates who understand the various intersectionalities. They’re looking for someone who cares deeply about students who is going to be present on campus with students. And who is able to understand a really wide range of needs at the college,” O’Dair said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 30 students congregated at Memorial Church on Saturday evening for a vigil to commemorate victims of recent chemical attacks in Syria,.
The event, called “In Solidarity with Syria,” included speeches and a moment of silence to show support for those affected by the six-year civil war.
Tajrean Rahman ’20, who organized the vigil, began the event by asking attendees to acknowledge what she called as a “bubble” at Harvard, which prevents students from fully recognizing the impact of Syria’s civil war.
“We show solidarity for a thing that may not impact us directly, but we should feel it just the same...we are in a bubble in a sense, especially at Harvard,” she said. “When you see a headline on a social media post and it is of a child dying, a lot of times we might see this image, we might read this headline and then we scroll past because it’s just a headline.”
Rahman said she wanted her event to signal that an attack on innocent Syrians “is not okay,” and to lament inaction from Americans to stop the war.
“These children are still dying. These people are under the worst conditions and we’re like that’s it. We’ve done our bit,” she said.
Students from across the University spoke at the event, including Bushra Hamid ’20 and Rana Abdelhamid, a graduate student at the Kennedy School, with most expressing a desire for empathy for refugees and casualties of the war.
“Today just marks a day where standing in solidarity should never stop,” said Hamid, a Syrian American. “The pain should never end until the pain of other people’s suffering ends.”
Many across Harvard have friends and family members affected by Syria’s deadly war, although several of Harvard’s schools list no students as having Syria as their primary country of citizenship.
Following the speeches, attendees observed a moment of silence for those affected by the attacks and the war. Rahman closed the vigil by urging students to get involved in activism against the war and recent attacks.
Amal A. Abdi ’20, who stood with dozens in the audience, said the vigil helped her comprehend damage done by the attacks, which killed several dozen Syrian civilians.
“We are in a bubble at Harvard and to actually hear about what’s actually happening in Syria, it’s heartbreaking and it’s so easy to distance ourselves and to dehumanize them because they’re so far away,” Abdi said. “I  want to remind myself that there are real people who are getting hurt,” she said.

This weekend, the Harvard Sailing team faced off in two regattas—the New England Team Race Championship and the Emily Wick Trophy.  Last weekend, the squad competed in four regattas against many of the same teams it rematched this weekend.
The New England Team Race Championship was hosted by Tufts and held in the Charles River basin, where the Crimson vied among eleven other top tier collegiate programs in Lark vessels.  Since the venue also serves as Harvard’s home course, difficult conditions are nothing foreign to the seasoned Charles River veterans.
However, with winds of up to 8-28 knots, the weather proved to be extremely adverse.  Early on, many sailboats in the field experienced breakdowns, and one boat lost its spreader bracket rivet, causing its mast to bend.  In response to the complications, the regatta officials dropped six boats from the races to make it only an 18-boat race.
Harvard walked away with an eighth place finish from the regatta, tallying a cumulative 5-13 record at the race and beating out the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Bowdoin College, Connecticut College, and Brown.  Yale prevailed despite the rough waters and secured the conference championship, locking up an 18-5 record.
In the Emily Wick Trophy, in which only the women’s division of the team competed, the Crimson lined up in a field of 20 collegiate programs at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.  The races were run in FJ and Z420 sailboats, and the sailors faced similarly variable wind conditions to their Charles River basin counterparts.
In the end, the Crimson completed the two-day regatta placing 15th overall, a two-place drop in rank compared to last year’s iteration of the race.  Harvard fell to Ivy League schools competing in the interconference regatta, including the Bulldogs, which took the trophy, No.7 Brown, and No.12 Dartmouth.  Nevertheless, Harvard bested Penn in addition to four other programs by the end of the weekend.
While the Crimson may have been met with mixed results this past weekend, it will compete in the Thompson Trophy, Presidents Trophy, Owen Trophy, and the Ogen Trophy next Saturday.

For 15 minutes of Saturday’s game against No. 7 Princeton, everything seemed to be going well for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team. The Tigers had scored three times, and the Crimson had answered each goal with a score of its own, leaving the game tied at 3-3 halfway through the opening period.
When the final whistle blew 45 minutes later, Harvard had kept pace with Princeton in most statistical categories. The Crimson was close behind its opponent in shots, posting 26 to the Tigers’ 30, and had actually outpaced Princeton in draw controls, 16-10.
However, the Tigers had a significant edge in the only category that really counts. Princeton (9-1, 3-0 Ivy League) blew Harvard (6-5, 3-1 Ivy) away with a barrage of goals, erasing any memory of the early tie as it beat the Crimson, 20-5, in Princeton, N.J.
“[We need to work on] sticking together as a team when things are going both well and badly [and] playing together,” senior attacker Marisa Romeo said.
More than anything, the result came down to efficiency in front of net.
The Tigers were devastatingly effective, converting two-thirds of their efforts on frame. Princeton senior midfielder Olivia Hompe, who is second in the country for goals per game, led her team with five scores and an assist, while 10 different Tigers players found the back of the net over the duration of the contest.
Only one Princeton player recorded a shot without a goal, while four members of the Crimson did the same. Harvard’s three most prolific scorers on the year, sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee, tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon, and Romeo combined for 13 shots but produced only one goal and two assists between them.
The matchup marked the first time that Romeo has been held scoreless this season, and the Crimson’s five goals were its lowest total for a single game this year.
The Tigers were strong between the pipes, producing 12 saves to keep Harvard off the board and limiting the Crimson to a single goal in the second half.
Meanwhile, Harvard only came up with half as many stops. Junior goalie Meredith Brown turned away five of the 17 shots she faced in 45 minutes of playing time, while junior goalie Olivia Gundrum played for a quarter of the game and allowed eight goals on nine shots.
The Crimson was also not helped defensively by repeated forays into foul trouble. Harvard racked up 10 more infractions than Princeton, collecting 33 to the Tigers’ 23. The Crimson picked up 19 of those fouls in a second period in which it was outscored 10-1, while Princeton recorded just seven fouls in the same stanza.
Harvard also collected six yellow cards in the second half alone, more than it has been awarded in any complete game this season. The Tigers capitalized on three of those opportunities, scoring a trio of man-up goals in the closing stanza.
The three man-up scores, combined with the Crimson’s general difficulty with fouls, contributed to a second period in which Princeton obliterated any hopes of a Harvard comeback.
The Tigers scored seven times, including three consecutive goals for Hompe, before the Crimson was able to get on the board.
Just under 15 minutes through the second frame, junior midfielder Julia Glynn faked a pass, cut in front of the goal, and beat the Princeton netminder with a shot fake before easily finding the back of the net for her 13th finish of the season and Harvard’s lone score of the period.
By the time the Manhasset, N.Y. native picked up her goal, though, the Tigers had already scored 17 of their own, and the result was out of reach for the Crimson. Three more Princeton goals in the closing 15 minutes of the matchup, including two in man-up situations, made sure of the Tigers victory.
Princeton also closed out the first half with four unanswered goals, sending the teams into the break with the score at 10-4 in the Tigers’ favor. But prior to the Princeton run, the game had been quite close.
The Tigers drew first blood, but Harvard responded quickly through MacAfee. The sophomore picked up a pass from classmate and attacker Nicole Baiocco and finished from close range to tie the score at one apiece three minutes into the game.
Princeton retook the lead, but freshman midfielder Katie Muldoon scored on a free position opportunity just 40 seconds afterwards to restore the tie.
Sophomore midfielder Caroline Garrity would repeat the pattern at 15:57 in the first half, when she whipped the ball into the top of the Princeton net after receiving a pass from Romeo. The goal tied the game up once again at 3-3 after a free position finish for the Tigers.
Princeton would break the streak with three unanswered goals before Garrity scored again, finishing off a give-and-go move with McMahon to narrow the Tigers’ lead to two points.
After Garrity’s second score, Princeton would take over, going on a 14-1 run to close out the game.
“It was a tough loss, but we still have three more Ivy League games to go, so we are looking ahead to preparing for Brown [next weekend],” tri-captain midfielder Megan Hennessey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend was a chance for the Harvard baseball team to recover from last weekend’s 0-4 Ivy-opening showing and make a definitive statement on its home turf.
Despite the team successfully defending O’Donnell Field against Massachusetts last Wednesday, this weekend’s series against Ivy League rivals Cornell and Princeton saw the Crimson drop three of four in Cambridge and remain bound to the cellar of the conference standings with a 1-7 Ivy record.
“Overall, we played pretty well—we were in all the games,” said sophomore first baseman Patrick McColl, who had a game-saving web gem at first in the opener against the Big Red. “We just couldn’t quite pull it out in a couple of them.”
Giving up two comebacks to Princeton and splitting offensive shootouts with Cornell have Harvard (12-15, 1-7 Ivy League) leaving O’Donnell without having clawed its way back into Ivy contention the way it hoped to. Although there are still 12 games left on its conference slate, the road doesn’t get any easier, as the Crimson welcomes Ivy-leading Yale to Cambridge next weekend in a four-game set.
PRINCETON 5, HARVARD 3
Last year’s Ivy champion Princeton (9-18, 5-3) gave itself some breathing room in the conference as it completed the two-game sweep of Harvard with a 5-3 comeback win.
The Crimson’s tally in the first inning—an RBI double by team batting average leader sophomore Patrick Robinson to plate captain Josh Ellis—held up for three innings in what was shaping up to be a pitcher’s duel between Harvard’s sophomore Kevin Stone and Princeton’s junior Ben Gross.
While Stone pitched 8.0 innings to give the Crimson bullpen some rest, Gross settled down in the 1-0 game and proved himself the ace of the Tiger’s staff that he is: the Princeton starter went 7.2 innings, giving up one earned run on five hits with six strikeouts, to get the win and lower his team-leading ERA to 1.46.
“We still have some work to do to try and extend ourselves in those early positions where we have the opportunity to,” said sophomore Trent Bryan, who batted leadoff in the series. “[We have to] try and come away with a more comfortable lead earlier on.”
With Harvard’s offense held quiet until the ninth inning, the Tigers put together three earned runs against Stone to take the lead for good. The Crimson defense, meanwhile, did its part—Harvard turned a season-high four double plays in the game.
In the ninth, freshman Jake Suddleson gave Harvard some hope with a two-run blast to pull the Crimson within two, but Princeton’s top bullpen arm, sophomore Ryan Smith, retired the next two Harvard hitters to seal the deal.
PRINCETON 9, HARVARD 4
Sunday’s beautiful afternoon weather betrayed the Crimson in the seventh inning of a 4-4 tied game in the doubleheader opener, as the Tigers opened the floodgates with five runs to snatch the victory at the last second, 9-4.
Freshman righty Kieran Shaw was tagged for five runs—one unearned—in his one inning of work and took the loss.
“We were competitive until the very last inning, really,” said Bryan. “That was good to see—oftentimes when we would fall behind early in the game, we wouldn’t necessarily maintain our competitive drive to stick with it to the end and try and come back. We did a good job of staying in it.”
Start sophomore Simon Rosenblum-Larson was a strikeout machine in the seven-inning game, knocking out a career-high 10 batters in his six innings of work whilst allowing just two earned runs. Two errors by the Harvard defense behind him did him no good; one more error in the ninth inning also hurt Shaw.
The Crimson got hits scattered across the lineup to back Rosenblum-Larson and account for its six hits, but the fateful seventh inning saw it all unravel and Harvard was unable to muster anything more than pinch hitter Matt Hink’s double in the bottom half of the seventh.
“Last weekend, we let our pitchers down as far as our hitters went; we pitched the ball well then but couldn’t quite hit it,” McColl said of the offense-defense syncopation. “This weekend, [that balance] seemed like it switched a little bit.”
CORNELL 9, HARVARD 5
Cornell (13-11, 3-5) racked up 16 hits and the Crimson wasn’t far behind with 15, but it was the Big Red’s crooked innings that gave them a lead that the home team couldn’t surmount. Cornell put up a five-spot in the third and plated three more in the fifth against Harvard starter junior Noah Zavolas to pull away and take the game, 9-5.
Bryan went 3-for-5 in the leadoff spot with an RBI and a run scored, while Ellis went 3-for-4 with a run scored. Four other Crimson hitters had two-hit days, though no Harvard batter could coax a walk out of Cornell pitching.
After Zavolas left in the fifth with 4.2 innings of work under his belt, freshman lefty JT Bernard and junior righty Garrett Rupp shut out the Big Red thereafter in one of the most solid bullpen outings from the Crimson this season. Rupp pitched a clean three innings with just two hits given up; Bernard walked two in 1.1 innings but struck out two and escaped unscathed.
Senior Drew Reid, McColl, Bryan, and Robinson all drove in runs, with McColl driving in two on a double to right field in the third inning. Robinson continues to sport an OPS over 1.100.
HARVARD 7, CORNELL 5
Junior John Fallon had a day of wild deuces: the Harvard third baseman went 2-for-2 with two RBI’s and two runs scored, with a walk thrown in, to lead the Crimson to a promising 7-5 opening win against Cornell for its first Ivy win of the year.
McColl’s game-sealing dive also highlighted Harvard’s defensive abilities, as although the team made seven errors total in the four weekend games, the Crimson was second in the Ivy League as of April 6 in both fielding percentage and had the second-lowest total of errors.
The critical line drive stop came with two outs in the top of the seventh, with the bases loaded and Cornell shooting for a comeback bid, down 7-5.
“It’s all reactions at that point—[the ball] was coming pretty fast,” McColl said. “It was good to get that win—you don’t really know what happens there if the ball gets by. It was a really exciting moment and it really got everyone going.”
The game remained scoreless until the fourth, when the teams combined to score a flurry of 12 runs over the next three frames.
McColl, Ellis, and Reid all contributed two hits along with Fallon, with Reid knocking in two runs with a double in the fourth to score Ellis and Fallon. Ellis’ bat has heated up extensively since the start of the season: the senior catcher and team captain leads the team with a .400 BA in Ivy play and is now hitting .333 overall.
Junior Ian Miller pitched six innings and gave up six hits, five earned runs, and struck out five in his second win of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The only thing better than one champion is two, just ask the Harvard women’s golf team.
In their second invitational of the spring season, the team picked up their second consecutive individual gold medal. Well actually, they picked up their second and third. Sophomores Anna Zhou and Michelle Xie tied each other for the Naval Academy’s Golf Invitational gold medal.
Traveling to Annapolis, Md., Saturday and Sunday for Navy’s Invitation at the school’s own golf course, the team did all but clean shop. Taking five total golfers, Harvard finished with four in the top six and the team gold to match.
“It was actually a last minute decision to come to this tournament, as our previous planned tournament was canceled due to weather issues and the course could not open,” Xie said. “We are so thankful to be able to play in Navy's spring tournament, and four of us had played in their tournament in the fall, so we had some background knowledge going into the weekend.”
Zhou took an early lead and managed to hang on throughout the weekend. Starting off just two above par at 74 shots, the sophomore was two shots ahead of the field with two competitors at 76 a piece. Just behind that group was Xie, who finished Saturday’s round at 77 shots and tied for fourth.
“Coming into this tournament, we weren't focused on scores but simply wanted to apply what we had been working on in practice to the course, and I think our team's great attitude carried us through the tournament,” Zhou said. “Individually, I owe a lot to my teammates for keeping me focused and being a great source of support throughout a rough week. The first round saw a lot of wind—taking the round one shot at a time helped me stay process-oriented and keep my game stable.”
Captain Anne Cheng was not far behind the group either. Shooting a 79 in the first round of golf, the captain finished the day at a solid seventh place. In 10th was classmate Nina Fairbairn who shot an 80 Saturday. Freshman Ji Hae Lee was four shots behind and in 27th.
Nearly everyone improved their position in the second round of play. Zhou maintained her first place lead with 78 shots. Xie capitalized on Zhou’s slower round and tied up the competition with a round at three over par, jumping three spots to first. The duo finished at a total shot count of 152.
“Anna and I played in a two-hole playoff,” Xie said. “Because we tied and were worried about making our flight, we left it at a tie.”
Fairbairn also utilized a second round, jumping up four positions with a 78 shot round, tying for sixth place. Tied for sixth right along with her was classmate Cheng who shot a 79 and jumped one spot. The pair of seniors finished the invitational at a solid 158. Ji Hae Lee hit 83 in Sunday’s round of golf to finish out the weekend with 167 shots and a 28th place finish.
“Despite sickness and injuries on the team, we did our best with what we could control and stuck to our process,” Zhou said. “We're just glad and grateful for the opportunity to be out on the course in nice weather, with two weeks until Ivies.”
The Ivy League Championships two weeks away, Harvard is situated well with respect to its fellow Ancient Eight competitors. The only Ivy League team present at the Naval Academy Invitational was Dartmouth. The Big Green also brought five golfers, placing in fourth, sixth, 23rd, 31st, and 34th.
“We have been working really hard with the facilities available to us through this long winter,” Zhou said. “Every team member continues to improve and perfect their game, and I am confident that we are in a good position as a team going into Ivies.”
Harvard has won five consecutive Ivy League titles but it’s not quite smooth sailing as Princeton posted a strong showing at last week’s Harvard Invitational. Taking first on the day, the Tigers had golfers that finished in both second and fifth.
“We are definitely trending in the right direction, and winning definitely feels great,” Xie said. “Next weekend, we will not be playing in a tournament just so that we are well-rested, practiced, and have all our respective academic lives in order before Ivies. It's going to be exciting to play in Florida again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In May of 1899, the Presidents of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England formally challenged the Harvard and Yale track teams to a meet. 12 consecutive losses to their American rivals and over a century later, they’re probably wishing they hadn’t.
The roots of the what is called the Transatlantic Series can be traced back to an 1894 competition between the Bulldogs and Oxford and now represents the oldest ongoing international track and field meet in the world, predating even the modern Olympic games.
The biennial meet pits the Crimson and Yale against their counterparts, Oxford and Cambridge, who together form the Achilles Club. Utilizing the British scoring system, the meet allots a point for every event winner and the team with the most points at the end of the 40 event meet takes the title.
Before the meet, the two British teams stayed four days in Cambridge—Mass. that is—before taking to New Haven for four more.
“During their stay it was four days of laughter, culture sharing, and fellowship,” men’s co-captain Julian Nunally said. “I learned a great deal from having them over and it is truly and honor to participate in the world’s ‘oldest continuous track meet.’”
Saturday represented latest installment in the 46 meet series between the schools as the team of Harvard and Yale carried the competition in a 26-16 victory over their competitors from across the pond.
Hosted by the Bulldogs at Dewitt Cuyler field in New Haven, Conn., the combined men and women’s teams of the Crimson won 11 events, with the former winning four and the women seven.
“I think I speak for the whole team when I say that we see all of our meets as opportunities—to push ourselves further, to perform better, to strive for excellence,” said junior pole vaulter Marlee Sabatino. “However, Saturday's competition was unlike the others because the team's focus was sincerely on the spirit of camaraderie amongst four of the greatest academic institutions in the world, celebrating the chance to be a part of one of the oldest international competitions in the world. For me personally, coming together with Yale and competing against the Oxford and Cambridge pole vaulters really meant cheering my heart out for all four teams.”
For the combined Harvard and Yale women’s team, the victory was the 10th consecutive of the series, and 15th overall. Crimson senior Nikki Okwelogu claimed two points on her own as the 2016 Outdoor All-American in shot put carried the event with a toss of 15.63 meters, over two meters further than her closest opponent. Competing also in discus, Okwelogu claimed her second gold of the day with a throw of 49.37 meters, this time over six meters further than the second place finisher. Hammer throw was the only event in which the senior participated in and did not win first place, this time placing third with a 48.47 meter throw.
Sophomore Gabby Thomas also made her presence known at the meet besting both a personal and 15-year school record for the first place finish in long jump. The sophomore jumped 6.10 meters to take the gold medal and earn a point for the Americans.
Another personal best for came this weekend from Sabatino as she carried the pole vault point for Harvard and the Bulldogs. The Hillsborough, N.J., native vaulted 3.85 meters to achieve her best mark for the outdoor season.
“I was happy with the progress that I felt in my vault, but I know there are higher bars to clear this season,” Sabatino said. “So I'll keep believing in the process and training hard, just like my teammates do.”
The women’s runners won the rest of the team’s points. Sophomore Ngozi Musa was the first to strike, taking the gold in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.79 seconds. In the hurdle variant of the race, freshman Karina Joiner claimed her first collegiate gold in the event finishing in 14.19 seconds.
The final point of the day came at the hands of veteran Jade Miller. The senior beat her closest competitor, Crimson freshman Zoe Hughes, by nearly a second finishing in 24.93 seconds. Hughes took silver with a 25.83 mark.
On the men’s side of the competition, half of the group’s points came from Nunally as the combination of the Harvard and Yale men won their half of the meet for the 26th time in 28 meetings. However, this might be in part attributed to Achilles Club’s lack of administrative investment.
“I want to recognize how phenomenal the athletes at Oxford and Cambridge are considering they have no support from their university and no coaches yet both of the matches were very close,” Nunally said. “That is a testament to their work ethic and discipline.”
The co-captain carried the shot put competition easily, tossing the shot a distance of 16.42 meters and finishing nearly two meters further than his closest Achilles Club competitor, Angus Lockhart at 14.79 meters. In discus, Nunally out threw Lockhart again to claim gold, only this time it was by a margin of 12.50 meters with the co-captain throwing for a distance of 46.05 meters.
Freshman Donagh Mahon got on the board for the Crimson as well, taking first in the high jump with a leap of 1.94 meters. In sprints, Jacob McLennan claimed Harvard’s final gold with a time of 53.77 seconds in the 400-meter hurdles, just under three seconds ahead of the next closest finisher.
Following the competitions, an award ceremony was held by the Bulldogs where dinner was served and the winners of each event were honored.
“The competition went well and both the men and women's joint teams defeated Oxford and Cambridge but when it comes to what we gained from this event together I would say that we are all winners,” Nunally said. “Of course, Yale put on a phenomenal banquet after the meet and we dressed up, ate, and handed out awards to the top performers. This was a great event, a fun competition, and more importantly an exchange of culture brought upon us by being members of Harvard track and it was an honor to be able to continue in this history.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The more Harvard women’s rugby plays, the better the weather gets. That’s one reason to root for them. The other reason—they’re good.
Avenging a heartbreaking 14-5 loss against Dartmouth last November in the Ivy League Tournament Championship, Radcliffe Rugby responded with blows of its own on Sunday afternoon by holding the Hanover, N.H. team scoreless. This performance landed them a spot on the podium at its third straight tournament.
“This tournament went really well,” said recently named NIRA All-American senior Claire Collins. “We were really, really pleased with it. I think that we showed a lot of mental toughness, in that we were able to come into every game with a lot of physicality and putting forth a lot of effort.”
HARVARD 24, DARTMOUTH A 0
A lot of rivalries are developed of spite, and solidified with hatred. Or they can be imparted with congeniality. In a game in which the team that hits better wins, it’s usually the former. But the game between the two Ancient Eight teams played on Sunday bucked that trend by showed a friendly competitiveness.
“It’s always fun when we play Dartmouth because we do know them so well at this point,” Collins said. “We play them multiple times a semester, basically every semester. We felt really confident going into that game because we had played so well throughout the day and I think we able to really execute our game plan, play with all seven members of the field, and really hit them hard.”
Harvard faltered in last season’s finale because it was stymied by Dartmouth’s defense, which allowed just five points (for reference, the Crimson scored 91 in a game against Cornell last fall). But with more rooms to move in 7s play, Harvard showed spring in its step. This time around the team scored three tries in the first half, exploiting the space and its speedy wingers.
The team did not let off the gas pedal in the second half to cruise to its second straight game in which it held its opponent scoreless.
Women’s rugby was able to land a third place medal, meaning that they have taken three of the top four finishing in its opening tournaments. The only one that has escaped is the space atop the podium. But with performances like this and Ivy 7s Championships coming up in two weeks, there is much to be optimistic about attaining that prize.
HARVARD 29, DARTMOUTH B 0
In the ten-team, two pool tournament several teams brought multiple squads to give their players more playing time and experience. But more isn’t always better. Playing Harvard, Dartmouth also experienced more defeat.
The Crimson brought the face of youth to the Big Green. Prolific freshman attacker Delia Hellander provided the opening try in the last pool game of the afternoon. But classmate Dominique Cantave, coming off injury, debuted this spring by contributing a try as well. The pair combines with other strong players including All-American Caitlin Weigel to form a formidable future for Harvard.
From there, the Crimson only looked forward. While a much higher score might be expected in a game against a lower side, the team was looking at other, more important things.
Getting back into game action means seeing things at higher speeds. Defense suffers and offense just doesn’t seem to look like it did in practice. To remedy this, the team’s leadership preaches spacing.
“In 7s, moving the ball to space is the name of the game and in order to do that we have to have a really steep and wide alignment so that we can beat people to the ball, so that we can move the ball to space,” Collins said.
Proper alignment is especially important while playing 7s because one blown position often leads to a try. But taking the final two games of the tournament in hand, the concept seems to be coming together.
“I think that we were really disciplined in staying in our alignment, getting the ball to space, and then having the support there where it needs to be,” said Collins. “So we were able to keep possession most of the game, every game, it felt like, which was awesome. And that means you get tries on the board.”
ARMY 26, HARVARD 10
Collegiate women’s rugby has some pretty clear tiers: national contenders, conference contenders, and club teams. Army is at the top. The team from West Point put on a clinic by blanking Harvard 21-0 in the first half, stifling its northern neighbors.
But the Crimson did show some resilience at the end, scoring two tries in the second half that would propel them to two unblemished games to finish off the tournament. Most impressive and encouraging about the result was the dynamic try to close out the game in which all seven Harvard players passed around the ball on the pitch. The concept of spacing was turning from an abstract concept to a systemic facilitator.
HARVARD 26, NORWICH 12
In a rematch of play from last week, the Crimson displayed early tournament jitters against the Cadets. Acting as medicine, Norwich broke into the box score first with a try and would continue to pressure Harvard going into the halftime locker room.
“That was a tough game at the start,” Collins said. “We let up two pretty soft tries, but we had total confidence in our team. We had seen them last weekend and we knew that we could come back and beat these guys. And I think that we really stayed composed and stuck to our structures, and we were able to stretch the field, attack the holes, and score, you know, four unanswered tries.”
Once again, the team from Northfield, Vt. was a wake-up call—which the Crimson dutifully answered. Harvard would put up 16 unanswered points and moved on to fight a stronger battalion.
HARVARD 31, BROWN 5
Facing the hosts of the tournament, Harvard make sure to make itself right at home. The blowout victory to start the day, along with its strong performance against Dartmouth, makes the team primed for a good performance at Ivys.
Indeed, the Crimson let up five points each of its two games last year against Brown at the league championship. But the Bears can easily turn into bulls, as they routed the Crimson 36-0 at the Varsity 7s Championships.
Harvard is in the driver’s seat. It just needs to keep moving forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Men’s Volleyball  (9-12, 6-6 EIVA) had a tough weekend at home as it fell against both of its conference opponents. The Crimson came into the weekend tied for second in the EIVA standings, but with the two losses now finds itself outside of the top four in the conference. After losing an emotion filled five-set thriller to Saint Francis (13-14, 8-4 EIVA) on Friday night, the Crimson suffered a devastating loss to the No.12 Penn State Nittany Lions (17-10, 9-3 EIVA) on senior night.
“Composure, experience, and desire to be in those situations. Right now, sometimes I think when we get in these situations we get tight, and at some point with enough experience, we’ll find those situations and the nerves won’t play a role,” coach Brian Baise said.  “I think especially now at this point it has happened a number of times and I think we just get tight and stop moving and stop playing with instinct. We start getting tentative.”
PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 0
The nationally ranked Nittany Lions, which has sat atop the conference throne for much of the program’s history, looked prepared to continue that reign as it swept Harvard in three sets. Penn State, coming off a shocking three set loss to Sacred Heart in Connecticut, had not interest in repeating that level of performance in the Malkin Center.
The Crimson, coming off an emotional loss to Saint Francis the night before, was determined not to repeat their mistakes. Despite major momentum shift swings in Harvard’s favor, it still fell short.
The Crimson, tried to fuel its performance with the frustration from the loss the night before, but it would take more than emotion to knock off Penn State, a team that defeated the previously No.1 Ohio State Buckeyes this season.
In the second set Harvard found itself in an all too familiar position, ahead of a nationally ranked team, and an opportunity to extend the lead. Up 14-10, unfortunately for the Crimson, it responded to the advantage as its done many times before this season, it let it slip away.
Penn State’s redshirt freshman Calvin Mende, lead the Nittany Lions with 14 kills, while the other redshirt freshman Luke Braswell served up 35 assists. Harvard junior Riley Moore lead the team with 9 kills, and junior Marko Kostich lead with 20 assists.
SAINT FRANCIS 3, HARVARD 2
In a heartbreaking loss, the Crimson dropped a 2-1 set lead to the Red Flash and saw a hard fought lead slip away. Harvard, which has been plagued by its inability to finish sets, fell victim to its own mistakes as it underperformed in the fourth and fifth sets.
The Crimson had a hitting percentage of -.042 and -.111 in the last two sets of the contest.
“I’m disappointed. I’m disappointed for the guys. They really worked hard and their focus was pretty good, we just couldn’t get the big points we needed,” Baise said. “We let a number of leads slip away, and to win at this point in the season against teams at this level we’ve got to capitalize.”
In the fifth set, leading 10-6, Harvard looked poised to complete the match and earn another conference win at home. However, as the set rolled on the momentum shifted back to the Red Flash which took advantage of the Crimson’s mistakes, winning the match 15-13.
Harvard, lead by co-captain Casey White and freshman Erik Johnsson, who collected 13 and 11 kills, respectively, was unable to overcome early blunders to earn the critical victory.
“It’s tough in a really close game like that to find one specific thing, especially in 5 sets we were kind of wavering, but just trying not to get down, especially not in the fourth set,” Moore said. “Once we got down big we kind of just let it fall away. We need to stay focused and be a little bit more resilient if we’re down, kind of get our rhythm back would have helped us a lot in that fifth set.”
As it currently stands, Harvard must beat both the Princeton Tigers and the NJIT Highlanders if it wants a shot at making it to the EIVA tournament. Two challenging road wins are what stands between the Crimson and a postseason campaign.
Despite its shortcomings this season Harvard has shown this season it is has the tools necessary to win when it matters most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing 6th out of 21 teams at the Furman Invitational last week with a score of two under par, the Harvard nen’s Golf team ended this weekend in second place at the Princeton Invitational, beating out all Ivy League competition and only falling behind a strong Seton Hall squad.
Below Harvard’s score of six on the Ivy totem pole, Princeton who finished third on its home turf. Harvard’s New Haven rival Yale was fifth and the two New York institutions, Cornell and Columbia ended the weekend of play 8th and 9th respectively with scores of 26 and 29. University of Pennsylvania and Brown finished towards the bottom of the 14 teams would ranked 11th and 13th respectively.
The narrative for the Princeton Invitational was set. With more than an inch of rain covering the course on Thursday, the greens were a tough prospect, so predictably, the scores from the Friday morning were lower than usual. In addition, a cold stretch moved in with strong winds. The teams would have to battle these adverse conditions.
“It was maybe a tougher day to play golf than usual, but I think we handled the conditions well, though the scores were worse for each team across the board on that Friday morning,” sophomore Aurian Capart said. “We powered through it, but given the weather, we did not know what to expect.”
And power through it they did. For a team that has only been playing outdoors for three weeks since its spring break golf trip to Florida, it was a strong performance over the two days. Considering the strength of the competition within the team, however, these performances come as a result of teammates constantly pushing each other to play at the highest level.
“The support within the team, whether we have a good day or a bad one has been a huge part of our progress in the fall season and in this spring season,” Capart said.
Last week’s intra-team scrimmage would dictate the travelers for the Princeton tournament. The top five golfers from the scrimmage were: senior and captain Daniel de la Garza, seniors Robert Deng and top performer from last weeks Furman Invitational Kendrick Vinar. The lone freshman was Ryan Rhee and the sole sophomore Aurian Capart. These would be the five Harvard representatives at the Princeton Invitational.
The Belgium native Capart led the team in scoring in New Jersey, shooting a 209 after three rounds which individually put him at 2nd out of 75 golfers, falling just behind Seton Hall’s Lloyd Jefferson Go who shot five shots better.
The Crimson’s Vinar ended the weekend with a score of 217. De la Garza finished third for the Harvard team. After a competition wide best first round score of 69, he cooled off, hitting a 75 in the second and third rounds. For Rhee it was the opposite. After a rocky start in the first round, he recovered with the weather, shooting a 75 in the second round and before finishing strong with a 69 in the third. Rounding up the Crimson team was Deng who, like Rhee recovered, shooting 80-73-69.
On the progress from the weekend, the team is upbeat about the performance. All tournaments and preparation go to hit top form for the Ivy League tournament in 10 days, and the play from the weekend is a good sign for the defending Ivy Champions.
“We have been working extremely hard and it is great to see that our games are progressing nicely. We had some really solid rounds this weekend, despite the challenging weather conditions,” de la Garza said. “I was particularly happy with the way all the team members handled themselves out there. We did a great job focusing in our process and the controllable factors.”
This was the team’s last match play before Ivies on Friday April 21st and with continued progress, the Crimson might just reclaim the Ivy League title.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team played three conference games, splitting the weekend 2-1. On Saturday, the Crimson (12-10, 2-2 CWPA) dominated both if its games, defeating Bucknell, 9-5, and George Washington, 15-8. On Sunday, Harvard dropped its second conference game to Michigan, 7-15.
“Overall it was a pretty good weekend. We won the games that we needed to to keep moving up in the seeding for Easterns,” sophomore Kristen Hong said. “Unfortunately, we lost to Michigan, but after playing them this weekend, we know that they are a very beatable team for us.”
NO. 20 HARVARD 9, BUCKNELL 5
Though Harvard trailed Bucknell (13-14, 2-4 CWPA) 2-1 after the first quarter, a second quarter offensive surge helped the team find its footing to win the game. Outscoring Bucknell 4-0 in the second frame, the Crimson entered the second half with a three point lead.
In the third quarter, Hong scored a pair of goals to help Harvard secure a five point lead heading into the final period. In the final frame, senior Zoe Osborne found the back of the net to defeat Bucknell 9-5. Along with her two goals, Osborne recorded a career high five assists.
Also a strong defensive game, Osborne and freshman Sofia Carrera-Justiz each had two steals, and junior Cleo Harrington had eight stops and two steals in the net.
NO. 20 HARVARD 15, GEORGE WASHINGTON 8
Continuing the momentum from the morning, Harvard dominated against George Washington  (13-11, 1-3 CWPA) from the opening minute. The Crimson immediately took control of the game with first quarter goals by Carrera-Justiz, Osborne and senior Eela Nagaraj.
“It’s been this way all year, but especially this weekend, it’s such a team effort,” coach Ted Minnis said. “We talked a lot all year about playing our best water polo at the end of the year, and I think we’re at the right spot to be ready.”
NO. 7 MICHIGAN 15, NO. 20 HARVARD 7
Coming of a five-game win streak and its two Saturday victories, the Harvard women's water polo failed to upset No. 7 Michigan on Sunday, losing 15-7 in its fourth conference game of the year.
The Crimson put up a strong defensive fight, trailing 2-1 after the first quarter, however, Michigan (25-8, 8-0 CWPA) outscored Harvard 4-1 in the second quarter to take a 6-2 lead at halftime.
The Harvard offense came out strong in the beginning of the second half, scoring four goals; however, its efforts were matched by the aggressive Michigan offense. The Crimson failed to make a final stand and Michigan pulled away in the last minutes.
Adding to her four goals from Saturday, Carrera-Justiz led the Harvard attack with two goals. Senior Michelle Martinelli, junior Sami Strutner, Hong and freshen Julie Harrison and Mathilde Ribordy each tallied one as well.
“We’ve really grown offensively and I know we didn’t beat Michigan, but I thought we did some really good things in the Michigan game,” Minnis said. “I thought our freshman played really well. I look at Julie Harrison coming off the bench, Mathilde Ribordy, I thought they had really good weekends. Sofia had a great weekend. They’re growing in a way, I want to stop calling them freshmen, because they’re playing like they’re sophomores or juniors.”
Harvard returns to action on Wednesday, April 12 against Brown at 7:30 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a duo of hat tricks from junior midfielder Joe Lang and freshman attackman Ryan Graff, Cornell surged to a 12-9 victory behind four unanswered goals in the fourth quarter.
Harvard (5-5, 1-2 Ivy) has dropped five of its last six after starting the season 4-0. Meanwhile, the resurgent Big Red (3-6, 2-2 Ivy) has won three of its last four after starting the season 0-5.
In typical Harvardian lacrosse fashion, Graff lead the Crimson to a 3-2 lead after the first frame, scoring the game’s opening goal 1:24 into play, and adding his second of the afternoon with 2:59 to play in the first quarter.
Harvard has struck first in all but two games this season. Consistent early offense has left the Crimson trailing after the first quarter in just three games this season—Harvard averages 3.3 first-quarter goals, as compared to 2.5 and 2.3 in the second and third quarters, respectively.
Lang carried the Crimson’s momentum into the second quarter, scoring the periods first two goals to put Harvard up 5-2. Cornell responded minutes later, as Clarke Petterson kicked off the Big Red’s rebuttal, firing home the first of Cornell’s five unanswered goals that left Harvard trailing 7-5.
Junior attackman Tim Edmonds’ 10th goal of the season stopped the bleeding with 8:58 to play in the third quarter. Edmonds has scored in seven straight contests.
The Big Red managed to hold Harvard’s leading scorer, junior attackman Morgan Cheek, scoreless for the first time this season. Cornell dialed-up the heat on the nation’s fifth leading scorer, and while Cheek tallied no goals, he affected the game with his passing, exploiting the extra defensive pressure, and assisting thrice.
After a rough stretch of games at the faceoff X, Harvard’s unit showed improvement on Saturday, winning 11 of 25 attempts. Cornell came into the game ranked 60th nationally and second-to-last in the Ivy League in faceoff percentage (.401). The Crimson’s .373 clip ranks 63rd in the country, and last in the Ivy League.
Harvard has tried a multitude of faceoff strategies this season—alternating between twin poles, and five different men at the X, but to no avail. Sophomore midfielder James Sullivan won ten faceoffs on Saturday, his first time reaching double figures since recording 12 wins against Holy Cross in Harvard’s second game of the season.
With 11:33 to play in the fourth quarter, Lang brought Harvard back within one, trailing 8-7, but Cornell’s Jeff Teat dashed the Crimson’s hopes, contributing two of the Big Red’s subsequent four unanswered goals that left Harvard 12-7 down with 4:21 to play.
