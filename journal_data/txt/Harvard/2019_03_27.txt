After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have a confession to make: I don’t really mind getting quadded.
All throughout my first year, I had been told by upperclassmen that the Quad was too far, and — not much else, actually. In fact, most people are complimentary about the Quad and its housing or community, before discrediting all those positive attributes with a simple “it’s too far.”
First of all, to put the distance into perspective, the walk from Cabot House to the Science Center is 14 minutes on Google Maps. The walk from beloved Dunster House? 12. From Winthrop House? 11. Of course, it is true that the walk from the river houses goes through important student locations like the Smith Campus Center, but the time it takes to get to the Yard and its major academic buildings is essentially the same (not to mention that most of the time, students in the Quad will be able to take a shuttle instead).
Let’s also put “the walk” into perspective. In no other context would a 15-minute walk be a burden so unmanageable that it single-handedly disqualifies the merits of a college dorm. In so many other institutions and in everyday life, this kind of a walk (once again, supplemented by a direct shuttle service) would be considered rather reasonable; it is only in the context of some even closer dorms that the Quad looks so distant.
Moreover, the “isolation” that many cite as the primary drawback of the Quad is actually one of its greatest attributes. The ability to go home, to physically leave a school, is one of the healthiest aspects of Quad life. Being able to escape the Harvard bubble is an underrated ability that one often forgets while living in the Yard. As a first-year in Thayer Hall, I wake up every morning to a view of the Science Center out my window and Sever Hall out the other. From the moment I leave my dorm, I am confronted by reminders of work and academics no matter where I go; it is as if the Yard is a cauldron of stress and pressure that is stirred incessantly until my work and personal lives blend together into one indistinguishable mess.
The school-home separation is subtle, but powerful — it is part of the reason why many of us look forward to going home during breaks, because we wish to forget about the things that worry us and literally escape to a location we do not associate with school. In the absence of our actual homes, the Quad (and its surrounding suburban landscape) serves as an excellent reminder that there’s more to Harvard than Lamont Library’s imposing shadow.
All of this is why, when looking back at Housing Day, I regret not showing as much enthusiasm when dorm stormers rushed into our room early in the morning. I want to tell the enthusiastic upperclassmen (who tried their best to cheer us up) that the eight frozen, disappointed students weakly smiling at them were simply playing their part in the often toxic narrative that surrounds housing at Harvard.
I was particularly struck that day by the contrast between the celebrations of students who got Lowell or Adams Houses and the Cabot upperclassmen reassuring crying or worried freshmen in the hallways, still in their face paint and holding signs declaring a now-ironic message of house pride. Housing Day is not a lottery that one wins or loses; it should be a celebration of passage and growth. Students should not feel compelled to apologize for where they live, and it is sad that House pride for some comes with such an asterisk.
The Quad has an amazing community, its housing is better than most, and it has its own collection of interesting restaurants, cafes, and stores for residents. As soon-to-be Pfoho residents, just this spring my blockmates and I can go horseback riding, sailing, kayaking, watch the Game of Thrones upcoming season premiere outdoors, and attend excursions into Boston led by our House tutors (among more events).
Perhaps it’s the distance that makes it so, but in these short weeks we’ve encountered a strong, vibrant, and welcoming Quad community that any House would envy. So the next time I tell you I’ll be in the Quad next year, please save your grimaces and half-hearted apologies — for me, there’s nothing to pity about sacrificing a few extra minutes of walking for superior housing and a community I would trade for none other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all those who are new to the Brexit debate, a quick summary: In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted in a public referendum to leave the European Union. Many saw it as the reclaiming of British independence from a declining, bureaucratic, power-hungry organization. Others decried it as the beginning of the end to the UK’s place on the world stage.
The withdrawal process remains in its infancy, but it has been mired in repeated national embarrassment. Prime Minister Theresa May voted to remain but was left to navigate the departure process. Her negotiated deal was condemned by colleagues on both sides and has twice been emphatically rejected by the House of Commons. On a kind reading, she has stoically attempted to reconcile the differences between the public and Parliament; on a harsher reading, her remarkable inconsistency has fueled national frustration and political division.
Last week, reportedly over a million people marched through the streets of London demanding a second referendum. In their view, the Leave campaign won by using misinformation and inconsistency; those who voted for the country to leave were not able to express exactly how. Meanwhile, committed Brexiteers have formed a Brexit party that views May’s compromises and any attempts to extend the timeline as unforgivable betrayals of the democratic process.
Indeed, what has struck me about the ongoing chaos is how often I have heard the word “democratic” used as a self-appointed compliment. Tune into the commons and expect to hear arguments from several defenders of the popular will: one who is carrying out the people’s wishes by delivering a clean departure from the EU, another who is defending them by delivering a divorce that protects their rights as economic actors, and another who is defending their supposedly real interests — that love for multilateral union that the electorate was simply never allowed to realize.
What separates these claims to democracy is that they appeal to its different tenants. Those who seek a second referendum are making an appeal to the superiority of representative democracy. They fear, in the words of Elbridge Gerry, Class of 1762, that “excess of democracy” that arises when the people “are the dupes of pretended patriots.”
Supporters of a second referendum would almost certainly extend the “pretended patriots” label to the other self-styled democrats: those who demand Brexit on the grounds of a direct mandate. Citing various polls, such Euroskeptics maintain that in the first referendum, Leavers clearly had in mind a so-called “hard Brexit.” This would mean an end to freedom of movement, an end to the customs union relationship, and an end to common workers’ rights across the continent — including the possibility of leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement at all; an outcome that could cost nearly a million UK jobs, and be a serious blow to its economic standing.
But these democracy lovers understand something that those of my own political leanings have repeatedly missed: that the Brexit referendum was not won on the basis of economic promise. We are living at a time when populations in Western countries feel alienated by a perceived “elite” who rule their affairs, and Brexit provided the illusion of control. While the individual British citizen may not have the means to combat economic hardship, a loss of meaning, and the absence of local community, their vote offered them the ability to claim something for themselves — that notion of Britain as a self-governing, powerful nation.
Perhaps this image is caught up in imperial bluster: a misguided nostalgia for a deeply flawed past. The rise in racial animosity since the referendum would lend credence to this view; indeed, Islamist extremism and far-right terrorism have been operating as two sides of the same coin for several years. But even so, that does nothing to support the notion that spitting on these people will do anything to restore their faith in the democratic process. It does nothing to suggest that condemning populist fervor will put an end to it.
I have significant problems with the EU, but my personal wish was always to remain. I believe that my country should be in the room when decisions are made that will affect the continent’s future; and although I remain skeptical of attempts to bring the European nations into ever closer union, I cannot help but believe that the EU has and will continue to be a force for good in the world.
Yet this belief does not convince me that the blame lies squarely on the shoulders of Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, and other prominent Leave campaigners. Rather, it convinces me that the multilateral message requires serious revitalization; that, to make a squeamish comparison with the United States’ political moment, liberals must listen to the concerns of people in all parts of the country.
It should be possible to talk across ideological lines without being labelled a traitor. It should be possible to make a case against open borders without being labelled a xenophobe. And when the Dalai Lama states that mass migration into Europe is unsustainable in the long term, it should be possible to ask why certain words can come from one mouth and not another.
Most of all, it is necessary to set out a positive vision for liberal democracy: one that can speak to people’s distrust of the so-called establishment. This will not be accomplished by patronizing Leave voters; it requires a serious consideration of those who feel left behind by the process of globalization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The pervasiveness of sexual misconduct on Harvard’s campus has led us to repeatedly call on the administration to do more, not only in its handling of specific cases, but also in the resources it offers to students. Under the new leadership of Director Pierre R. Berastaín Ojeda ’10, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response has admirably stepped up to the task.
With its new “community engagement model,” OSAPR has begun taking a more proactive approach in supporting students and making itself available as a resource. One of the office’s main objectives is to increase its visibility to students as a resource. That said, we deeply support the efforts the office has taken to do so, especially as it emphasizes OSAPR’s educational role, focuses on individual student needs, and seeks to make the office a non-intrusive resource.
OSAPR has admirably demonstrated its support for students in the first few months of Ojeda’s leadership, as the office has made an effort to be an active presence on campus. For instance, the office recently set up a booth with refreshments and informational pamphlets for students at a protest against Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s recent decision to defend former film executive Harvey Weinstein, who faces multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Though OSAPR is not allowed to take an official stance on the contentious issue as a University office, we appreciate its presence at this student-directed event and its staff’s efforts to show active support to students who may feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or disheartened in response to Sullivan’s decision. In coming to the event and offering students a chance to voice their concerns more directly to OSAPR, the office demonstrates a positive way forward for the University in offering unbiased and neutral support to students. This is a direction we have urged the College to move towards broadly, and we are glad to see it here.
Not only does this “community engagement model” help increase OSAPR’s visibility across the University, but it has positively transformed the way in which the office offers support. Ojeda stated that OSAPR aims to occupy a role in offering “pastoral care” to students, and tailoring its services to students’ needs, keeping in mind the different individual circumstances of Harvard’s diverse student body, such as faith backgrounds and sexual orientations. Toward achieving this goal, OSAPR’s efforts to modify its services to individual student needs is exceedingly valuable to a student body that may often feel constrained and misunderstood by University bureaucracy, especially when dealing with experiences as sensitive and as traumatic as sexual assault.
Overall, we are pleased to see OSAPR’s proactive efforts in engaging with and supporting the student body, especially on a campus that repeatedly and unfortunately experiences revelations of sexual misconduct. We look forward to seeing the effects of OSAPR’s work in the long term, as it directs the University down an exciting and important new path for student care.

The Economics Department is taking steps to improve its graduate students' mental health in light of a survey conducted among Ph.D. students in the department which showed high percentages of anxiety and depression.
The mental health survey — conducted in 2018 by Harvard University Health Services — found that rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among graduate students in Economics were significantly higher than among College students or an age-match cohort in the general population.
Economics department chair Jeremy Stein said in an interview earlier this month that he found the study “distressing” and would work with his department to address the issue.
“If you read these studies it’s distressing, so it’s something we worry about, it’s something I worry about quite a bit," Stein said. "We’re trying to think of ways to do better."
The high-stakes environment of graduate school may explain the higher depression rates, according to HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira, who helped organize the survey.
“Graduate students eat, breathe, sleep, what’s happening in their department. Their whole life is about getting their doctoral degree,” Barreira said. “The power dynamics and the relationship dynamics are utterly different with graduate students than it is for College students. And the stakes are much higher.”
Stein said he hopes to improve the general Ph.D. culture in his department and the advising process in light of the survey findings.
“With respect to our graduate students, the advising process and the culture around the Ph.D. program more generally, we have some real work to do,” Stein said. “To be clear, this isn’t just us — many of these issues are profession-wide.”
Ph.D. candidate Matthew Basilico, who worked with Barreira and fellow graduate student Valentin Bolotnyy on the study, said the survey served as an important first step to addressing mental health issues in the field of economics.
“People recognize this as an issue in economics. Even describing the problem and getting people’s attention focused on it has been a really important step,” Basilico said.
He added that he thinks the department must continue to raise awareness, which can take the form of urging people to seek help for mental health issues and creating a more open culture to talking about personal problems.
The department has already worked to cultivate more personal advising relationships and peer support networks to increase openness and add another layer of support, according to Basilico.
“Advisers are seen as people who can be approached as friends to talk personal and professional problems. We’ve been encouraging culture change in discussions about that,” Basilico said. “We run a student support effort and peer counseling effort in our department.”
Basilico said he hopes these new changes will have effects stretching beyond student health.
“There are some features of economics that can be improved upon and will improve mental wellbeing and will lead to better research and better outputs for humanity.”

The percentage of underrepresented minority tenure track faculty in Harvard's Sciences division has increased 10 percentage points to 13 percent in the past year, according to Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs.
A report from last year found that only 3 percent of tenure track Sciences faculty were underrepresented minorities. In a March 9 interview, Stubbs reaffirmed his commitment to bolstering diversity in his division, which faces “particular challenges with regard to gender and minority representation nationwide.”
The division has broadened faculty searches, improved postdoctoral mentorship, and adjusted graduate student admissions criteria in an effort to address a “national pipeline issue” that Stubbs said contributes to a lack of diversity among Sciences division faculty.
The division’s current percentage of underrepresented minority faculty has not yet caught up with the share of underrepresented minorities in the national population — roughly 30 percent.
“My personal view is that [underrepresentation is] a reflection of national values. It’s not a reflection on our University. Now, I’m not trying to absolve us of responsibility of trying to address that,” he said. “I think a fair question to ask is, what the heck are we doing about the national pipeline issue?”
Stubbs outlined a number of the division’s current initiatives, one at each stage of the pipeline into the tenure track — undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and faculty.
At the end of the pipeline, the Sciences departments — most recently including Math — have broadened their faculty searches in intellectual scope in order to identify candidates who are both “outstanding” and “representational,” according to Stubbs.
“If I did a faculty search in a very narrow sub-sliver, the likelihood of an underrepresented strong candidate landing in that narrow field is small,” he said.
To better prepare postdoctoral scholars from underrepresented backgrounds to assume faculty positions both at Harvard and other institutions, the division started the “Future Faculty Fellows Program,” which provides them with more robust advising and support.
Stubbs also addressed measures taken to diversify the graduate student population in the division. He said that since “grit and perseverance” are just as robust indicators of success as test scores, the Astronomy department is piloting a new approach to admissions that emphasizes applicants’ demonstrated tenacity rather than their testing history.
In fact, the department has eliminated standardized GRE scores as a selection criteria. GRE scores correlate more with socioeconomic status than with “raw intellect,” according to Stubbs.
“[This] broader template of trying to identify people who are going to be successful has led to a much stronger minority and women cohort to our incoming graduate class,” he said.
Stubbs finally moved to address future initiatives that target undergraduates. He said some incoming College students are unaware of the skill level and knowledge they are expected to enter with if they hope to pursue advanced coursework in the sciences.
“I put myself in the position of a high school senior, somewhere in the country and receiving a notification that they’re admitted to Harvard, and having some combination of elation and dread,” he said.
One divisional goal is to elucidate skill-set expectations for admitted students, as well as to give them the tools to self-assess and fill in knowledge gaps during the summer, according to Stubbs.
Stubbs said he is in part motivated to pursue diversity initiatives by his experience feeling culturally alienated when he immigrated from Iran at the age of 17.
“It may not be apparent looking at me, as I am in my current job, that I have a tremendous amount of experience that I can draw upon to address the deficiencies that we have as an organization,” Stubbs said.
“What we would strive to accomplish is a day in the future when regardless of who you are, where you come from, what you look like, or what your accent is...you say: 'yes, I feel like I belong here, and, yes, I feel like I’m being successful,'” he added.

Lawyers for Harvard submitted a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a transgender woman, dubbed Jane Doe, who is alleging that the University violated federal Title IX law and Massachusetts laws by discriminating and retaliating against her after she reported an admissions officer sexually harassed her.
In the motion, filed March 14 at the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Harvard’s lawyers argued the plaintiff’s claims are “procedurally deficient” and the complaint should be dismissed because “she did not exhaust required administrative prerequisites.”
“The balance of her claims fail because she does not allege – beyond conclusory statements devoid of specific factual allegations – that Harvard took any action based on her gender or gender identity,” a memorandum filed alongside the motion reads. “More importantly at this stage, the claims must be dismissed because Plaintiff's Complaint contains no factual allegations that support her conclusion that gender bias played any part in Harvard's admissions decisions.”
The motion also alleges that Doe was denied admission to Harvard Business School and the Harvard Graduate School of Education — the two schools to which Doe applied — because she was not a competitive applicant.
The motion stated Doe did not meet the “educational qualifications” necessary for the programs she applied to.
"There is not a single allegation in the Complaint that suggests that Plaintiff was qualified for Harvard’s programs, casts doubt on Harvard’s non-discriminatory reasons for denying Plaintiff’s admission, or supports an inference of pretext,” the motion reads.
Doe’s lawyer Cynthia E. MacCausland did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The original complaint details several instances when the plaintiff said she was sexually harassed and discriminated against because of her transgender status. The plaintiff also alleges that shortly after reporting an admissions officer for sexual assault, she was denied admission to the Business School and the Graduate School of Education.
The plaintiff listed a series of demands in the original complaint, among them asking the University to issue a “declaratory judgement” admitting Harvard illegally retaliated against her in violation of Title IX and Mass. law. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits gender-based discrimination for institutions that receive federal funding.
The plaintiff also asked for permanent injunction “requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not discriminate against transgender students and individuals”; legal fees and other costs; and other relief that the Court deems necessary.
Prior to submitting the complaint against the University in January, Doe filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination on June 4, 2018, alleging the University discriminated against her based on gender identity. MCAD found a lack of probable cause in that case, but the complainant said the disposition “totally failed” to sufficiently address the assault and its alleged violation of Title IX policy.
The motion referenced the MCAD dismissal, which also noted that Doe was not a competitive applicant to either the Business School or the Graduate School of Education.
On the same day as the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her claims against Office for Dispute Resolution investigator Brigid Harrington who was listed in the original complaint. That office adjudicates formal Title IX complaints at the University.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment beyond the motion to dismiss and the accompanying memorandum in support.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a recent interview that Harvard is reviewing its admissions policies in light of the high-profile college admissions scandal that rocked universities across the country earlier this month.
Bacow said Harvard sees the revelations as an opportunity to continuing learning about the best way to conduct college admissions.
“Whenever something happens at another institution, it's an opportunity for all of us to learn,” Bacow said. “So, you know, we are looking at our processes right now and asking what can we learn from what happened at these other institutions.”
Authorities charged 50 people across the country on March 12, as part of the massive admissions scandal where wealthy parents bribed admissions counselors, college coaches, and standardized test administrators to secure spots for their children at elite colleges including Yale, Georgetown, and Stanford. Parents implicated in the scandal included CEOs, entrepreneurs, and Hollywood actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin.
William “Rick” Singer, a college admissions adviser and the perceived head of the conspiracy, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering, money laundering, to defraud the United States, and obstruction of justice.
Yale announced on its website March 26, that it rescinded the admission of a student whose parents paid $1.2 million to Singer to secure her a spot. That marks the first instance of a school making such a move after the scandal become public two weeks ago.
In the interview earlier this month, Bacow said that at Harvard, “we do some things very differently” than some of the schools involved in the scandal.
“For example, with respect to athletes, every athlete who is admitted to Harvard gets an interview,” Bacow said. “Apparently, not true at some institutions.”
In addition to interviewing all athletes, Bacow clarified that Harvard admissions decisions are not made by the Athletics Department.
“Admissions decisions — this actually came out in the lawsuit — are made by a committee of 40 people who all vote on each case with a show of hands,” Bacow said. “So, it actually makes it much harder to influence a decision because you have to persuade a lot of people.”
The College’s own admissions policies have faced scrutiny in recent years.
Harvard went to trial in federal court last October, as part of a four-year lawsuit brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. The suit alleges the College discriminates against Asian-Americans in its admissions processes by assigning qualified applicants lower personal scores to unfairly deny them admission. Harvard defended its policies in court and argued its race-conscious admissions policies are necessary to achieve diversity in its student body.
The three-week trial made public many previously private documents and hundreds of hours of testimony from top University officials that detailed the inner-workings of the Harvard admissions process. These details included information about how the College gives special consideration to the children of donors and what factors cause admissions officers to admit or reject certain applicants.
Judge Allison D. Burroughs is expected to rule on the Harvard case in the coming months. Bacow said in the interview that he remains confident that Burroughs will rule in the University’s favor.
“We have both, I think, the law and the facts on our side in this case,” Bacow said, reiterating his comments from before, during, and immediately after the trial.

Architect Kimberly N. Dowdell discussed strategies for equitable urban development and promoting diversity in architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design Tuesday evening.
In her lecture, entitled “Diverse City: How Equitable Design and Development will Shape Urban Futures,” Dowdell drew on her experiences growing up in Detroit and her work in real estate development.
Dowdell, who graduated from the Harvard Kennedy School in 2015, opened by telling personal stories from her childhood in Detroit, where she saw the deterioration of storefronts and houses that had been boarded up and left vacant. This decay, she explained, was caused by certain urban development policies. Dowdell used redlining — the practice of denying some services to residents of certain neighborhoods by not investing in them — as an example of how poor and minority areas are disadvantaged in real estate.
“Systemic disinvestment contributes to, essentially, poverty and that translates into limited access, not only to capital but to quality education, good jobs, quality foods, transportation, technology, information, goods and services, and healthcare,” Dowdell said.
Both people and cities, she said, go through cycles of trauma, equity, and resilience.
“Equity, if I boil it down to its most essential element, is making it right,” she said. “Cities can experience trauma and when you make it right, they can become more resilient.”
Dowdell outlined the strategy of Century Partners, her real estate development firm, which invests in specific Detroit neighborhoods by rebuilding vacant houses and selling them at affordable prices.
“It's really about, for us, bringing the community together, helping to empower them to work with us to help solve their own problems,” she said.
Dowdell is also the president of the National Organization of Minority Architects, and said she aims to promote diversity in the field.
“Part of good design is having a design team that reflects the communities that they serve,” she said.
Dowdell said she thinks visible, diverse mentorship is an essential part of increasing diversity.
“I think that helping to position particularly people of color in leadership in the profession is really important, because we have young people coming up behind them who want to see a future for themselves,” she said in an interview following the event.
Dowdell also noted the challenges of balancing the demands of investors and the needs of current residents when developing a neighborhood.
“You have to walk a pretty tight rope of doing what's right and doing what the people of the community really value and then also creating value in the work that you're doing,” she said.
Washington Fajardo, a Loeb fellow at the Graduate School of Design, said he visited Detroit last fall and saw firsthand the planning problems the city faces.
“I think Detroit is a really good opportunity for thinking out of the box and looking for a more innovative planning approach,” Fajardo said.
Andrea Reimer, another Loeb fellow, said Dowdell’s work is powerful, in particular pointing to her efforts to develop land that makes current city residents part of the rebuilding process.
“Her courage in the way she attacked the discussion really speaks to the way her courage plays out in the work that she's doing,” Reimer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting the 2019 season with three straight losses, many wrote off the Harvard lacrosse team. Yet, after two straight wins against Hartford (1-8, 1-1 American East Conference) and Providence (4-5), the Crimson (4-4, 1-1 Ivy League) went into its week-long road trip full of confidence and motivation.
HARVARD 14, BROWN 16
Harvard’s road trip began on March 16 with its Ivy League opener against Brown (3-5, 1-0 Ivy). The Bears held the lead for most of the game, but the Crimson would not let them break away, staying within three goals at all times.
Freshman attacker Austin Madronic helped lead the comeback effort with a goal in the third quarter, continuing his streak of at least one goal per game in his first six collegiate games. Unfortunately, the breakout star, who was recently ranked No. 6 out of all Division I men’s lacrosse freshman by Inside Lacrosse, sustained a slight concussion that would sideline him for the rest of the game.
With 7:45 left in the fourth, junior midfielder Nigel Andrews tied the game at 14. The teams continued to battle, but Brown was able to break away by scoring two goals in the final two minutes to secure a 16-14 win. Despite the loss, junior attacker and tri-captain Kyle Anderson was able to net five goals, and sophomore goalie Kyle Mullin recorded 19 saves. However, the team cares little about individual stats and looked to bounce back quickly.
HARVARD 12, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 11 (3OT)
Three days later, Harvard traveled across the Charles River to take on rival Boston University (7-3, 2-1 Patriot League). It was an important game for the Crimson, not only because the team was taking on a rival who was undefeated at home, but because the game marked the halfway point in the 2019 season and Harvard needed a big win.
Although the team was without Madronic, the rest of the squad fought hard, and the Crimson found itself in a tight game, down 5-4 at halftime. However, the Terriers came out and played strongly to enter the fourth quarter up 9-5.
“I thought we started out the game poorly, making a lot of mental errors and turning the ball over,” Andrews said. “We improved as we finished out the first half, but then came out in the third quarter making the same mistakes and found ourselves down by five goals.”
The Crimson battled back, though, and with 5:25 left in the fourth, the game was tied 9-9. In the last few minutes, each team scored a flurry of goals, and Harvard briefly took the lead, but a BU goal with one second left forced overtime. Yet, one overtime would not be enough to decide this one.
Mullin was able to make more clutch saves — stopping 19 total for the second straight game — and finally, with 1:45 left in the third overtime, Andrews scored the walk-off goal to give Harvard a much-needed win.
“We were resilient and fought our way back to force overtime, which says a lot about the character of the team,” said Andrews when asked about the win. “Overtime was sloppy, but we eventually found our groove on offense and were able to finish out the game and get a big win.”
HARVARD 12, DARTMOUTH 9
On March 23, Harvard traveled to Hanover, N.H., to take on Dartmouth (2-5, 0-1 Ivy League). The game was another important one for the Crimson. A win would secure a winning record for the road trip and put the team back at .500 on the year.
The Crimson leapt out to an early 4-1 lead, but Dartmouth battled back and took a 7-6 advantage in the third before finishing the quarter tied at seven. After falling in several tight games at the beginning of the season, the team made sure to make consistent fourth-quarter play a focal point moving forward.
“Obviously, we don’t want to be in a position where we’re down in the third quarter, but our play in the fourth quarter has definitely improved over the last four games,” said senior defenseman and tri-captain Jonathan Butler.
Harvard scored one early in the quarter, and then, just as the Crimson managed in several games earlier in the year, went on a quick but deadly run, netting three goals in less than three minutes.
Harvard found itself up 11-7 with 5:13 left, and although Dartmouth tried to stage a comeback, there was not enough time. The game ended as a 12-9 win for the Crimson.
The Crimson received major boosts from sophomore midfielder Steven Cuccurullo, who won 20 of 22 faceoffs, and junior midfielder Jeremy Magno, who netted four goals just two weeks after returning from an injury that kept him out for the first four games of the season.
“Overall, it’s great to get an Ivy League win after a tough loss against Brown the week before, so we feel like we have plenty of momentum going into the rest of our league games,” Butler said.
The team looks to continue its play against Albany (3-4, 2-0 American East Conference) at 7 p.m. today.
“At 1-1 in the Ivy League, we still have all of our goals for the season in front of us and we’re hoping to get a big win over Albany on Wednesday in the Stadium,” Anderson said. “The first game in Harvard Stadium always adds some extra energy to our play.”
Just over halfway through the season, the Crimson have battled all the way back, winning four of the last five games and are now back on a win streak. A win against Albany would put Harvard over .500 for the first time this year, but it is safe to say that the Crimson does not want to stop there.

It’s spring, which means it’s time to clean out your closet (and your life in general), Marie Kondo-style. The KonMari Method says that you should only keep things in your life that truly spark joy. If not, make like Ariana Grande: Thank it, and move on.
Like Kondo does, we have to organize our Harvard lives into categories to make the process more efficient.
Locations
Lamont Library
The smell of desperation and anxiety may be palpable here, but we just love to hate Lamont. Let’s remember that Lamont is always here for us and Lamont Cafe’s chocolate Javiva never fails to pick us up. We definitely feel sparks of joy here: I think we’ll keep Lamont.
Cabot Science Library
Let’s face it: Cabot is a place you go when you want to get work done but just end up staring at your computer for hours not getting anywhere. Getting nothing done definitely doesn’t spark joy. We think this one belongs in the discard pile. Cabot: Thank you, next.
People/Relationships
That One Blockmate Who Never Cleans Up
Maybe they’re a really cool person — we get that — but if they’re adding to the clutter in your life, do you really need them in your space? Thank them for the memories and move on. You can still be friends but maybe you’re not well (suite)d to be roommates.
Your Kinda-Sorta-Not-Really Friend
The noncommittal texts and random meetings as you’re walking through the Yard promising to “definitely grab a meal sometime” are really draining your energy. Think critically about these interactions. Do they really spark joy? If not, thank your friend for being a friendly face and let go of that noncommittal planning.
Academics and Extracurriculars
Clubs
To fully declutter your life and bring about maximal happiness, think deeply about what you’re involved in. Does your consulting club bring you joy? If yes, keep it! If not, maybe reevaluate and think about joining something more wholesome like the Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers Club instead.
Lecture
Are you falling asleep or failing to hand in those psets? It’s probably because your heart’s not in it. Though you may need this class for your concentration, take a beat and metaphorically throw it away. Understand that this particular class might not spark joy, but it may also just be a necessary evil in your life. Same goes for psets and papers. There’s no way to actually throw them away, but we can pretend. No thank you.
Your Physical Space: Dorm and Digital 
That Mug You Keep Forgetting to Wash
We know you keep saying you’ll do it, but be real with yourself — will you ever get around to cleaning that mug? Whether it sits menacingly on your shelf or you leave it in your communal bathroom, it’s time to part ways. To fully declutter your life, the KonMari method tells us that step one is to fully commit. Say thank you, and invest in a cuter cup that you’ll actually want to use.
Your Downloads Folder
Why on earth are three copies of the prompt for that paper you handed in two months ago still sitting on your computer? Unless fewer gigabytes leftover for downloading movies spark joy for you, it’s time to say goodbye.
The Succulent You Somehow Managed to Kill
Your plant used to once be green, but after leaving it unwatered for a bit too long (just as you do yourself on a night out), somehow you defied all odds and killed the plant that you were told was the easiest to take care of. Unfortunately, it no longer sparks joy, so thank your plant for adding some much-needed oxygen and greenery to the room while you did.
Hopefully, this method will help you tidy up your life here at Harvard. But if decluttering your own life isn’t enough, you can always learn more about the KonMari method from Marie Kondo’s book or Netflix special.
TLDR; if it sparks joy, keep it, and if it doesn’t, say thank you and part ways.
