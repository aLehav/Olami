Last week, Tufts University enacted a new policy barring sexual activity in rooms with roommates present. This decision to regulate and enforce restrictions upon students’ sex lives goes too far, delving into areas of private life outside universities’ purview.
While collegiate institutions bear responsibility to maintain the health and well-being of their students, this doesn’t justify undue intrusion into students’ personal lives. Providing resources on sexual education and counseling are one thing—imposing an umbrella mandatory rule about student sexual behavior such as this one takes a university’s involvement past education and protection.
Sexual practices are a serious issue for many college students, but they should be governed by mutual respect between roommates, not by administrative decrees. The etiquette of having guests over to a communally inhabited space can be difficult. Yet college students must learn to handle these situations themselves. College represents an intermediate stage of independence; the maturity to deal with this kind of situation should be cultivated by students, not deferred to university sex regulators.
Of course, such situations can be quite problematic and difficult to navigate, and not all students are ready to confront such issues. This is where the university can serve its proper role, however, meeting the more exceptional situations and providing counseling and guidance. Residential advisors, counselors, and other resources can mediate and provide guidance and, if necessary, take action in the event that a roommate violates the trust of his peers and disregards their concerns with his sexual behavior. But universities should approach such situations with the delicacy required, on a case-by-case basis—not through blanket legislation.
The onus remains on students, of course, to remember that having sex while roommates are present will likely create an uncomfortable situation. Remaining considerate and mindful of roommates’ comfort, however, should remain with students. It is not for Tufts, or any institution, to regulate when it is appropriate to engage in consensual dorm-room copulation.

Thesis writers accustomed to working from their personal nooks in Lamont Library may have to finish their theses in more foreign territory. The recent statements of Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer raise the prospect that some senior thesis writers who wish to stay on campus during J-term may be denied for lacking a “clear need.” This restrictiveness is unwise and harmful—any student who wants should be allowed to remain on campus to work on a thesis.
Even thesis writers who can’t claim a specific need to access labs or archives could have compelling reasons to be allowed on campus. The Harvard campus is an incomparable working environment for many students. In creating the new January break and moving exams to before winter recess, the administration acknowledged this implicitly. Studying for exams during break was both stressful and difficult. There is a psychological benefit to working in a Lamont, your house library, the dining hall, or your Harvard room. They provide the rigorous academic atmosphere that homes and local libraries cannot recreate. For many, it is easier to accomplish more when you are surrounded and encouraged by hundreds of other hardworking peers in a world-class research institution. The “Harvard bubble” is one of Harvard’s central scholarly benefits at any time of the year, and students should not have to forgo it during their greatest time of academic need.
On a more concrete note, theses can frequently change course midway, requiring a student to access resources he might not have expected to need. Forcing students without “clear need” to leave restricts this possibility. We understand that the university is worried about unoccupied students getting into trouble on campus if they do not have a reason to be there. Nevertheless, Harvard students who are under pressure to produce a quality thesis will have plenty of work to occupy their time.
The right of varsity athletes to stay has gone unchallenged—perhaps for good reason—but the university should not forget its core academic priorities. Harvard prides itself on all types of achievement, academic and athletic, and it should not have to sacrifice one for the other.
Most importantly, allowing students the resources they need to write their senior theses is crucial for the advancement of the university’s academic mission. The writing process is not always straightforward and schedulable, and seniors should not be forced to cap their intellectual possibilities because of a housing quota. For most students, January will provide three weeks of welcome relaxation with family and friends. Seniors who ask to forgo this opportunity to do some of the most rigorous research and thinking of their Harvard career should be encouraged and assisted, not turned away.

It’s 9:52 a.m., and I’ve snoozed that alarm three times already. There’s only one reason to wipe the goop from my eyes—and it’s a 10 o’clock section. Since my grade depends upon getting out of bed, I throw off the covers. Usually.
I’m not a morning person and have had my fair share of 9:52 a.m. battles in the past. But on Tuesdays and Thursdays this semester, I can magically rise and shine without a struggle. What’s changed? I’m auditing a class.
Arriving on time to a lecture that’s not only early, but also completely optional, might strike some as counter-intuitive. “Auditing a class?” skeptics often ask with raised eyebrows and a smirk. “Good luck.” Summoning up this extra motivation, when many of us struggle to stay awake through classes we’re already required to attend, seems unlikely at best. But there’s a secret here: When people view an educational opportunity as just that—an opportunity—it stops feeling like such a burden.
The skeptics’ rationale speaks to conflicting realities of life in the 02138. This campus purports to contain some of the most intellectually curious students in the world. However, many spend countless hours attempting to escape from schoolwork—whether by roaming Lamont aimlessly, Facebook-stalking potential love interests, or downing scorpion bowls at the Kong. When, five hours before the deadline, it’s impossible to avoid that paper any longer, the finished product often turns out less than inspired. What happened to the hunger for learning that so many of us claimed to possess in college application essays?
Somewhere along the way, I think, many Harvardians transferred their high-school mentality to higher education. We view attending lectures, just like showing up for 10th grade, as an external expectation—something that society and parents tell us we have to do. It’s easy to adopt a victim mentality, where heavy courseloads and unfair grading are out to get us. The only choice: to rebel. Lecture? What lecture?
But whether students remember it or not, they’re all here by choice. And most do experience bursts of academic excitement in specific areas of interest. Ask a senior thesis writer to describe his topic, and once he stops ranting about how overwhelmed he’ll be until March, he might spend 45 minutes explaining the intricacies of animal-rights laws in Chile. That certainly qualifies as a hunger for learning.
When I wake up every Tuesday and Thursday in order to audit, I’m reminded of why I came to college in the first place. Watching a brilliant professor do his thang—without the pressure of assigned readings, or section discussions, or grades—actually allows me to listen. I’m not tempted to check Gmail; in fact, I don’t even bring my computer. I’m there because I want to be. In an ideal world, of course, the same would apply to college as a whole.

To borrow from Hamlet, something is rotten in the state of Israel.
That is, something is rotten in the state of Israel if there is truth to the Goldstone Report.
Thankfully, the Obama administration—the same administration, it should be said, that strongly disapproves of Israeli settlement expansion and that gave the world the now-famous “Cairo Speech” this past June—seems to recognize the report for what it is: age-old anti-Israel bias couched in apparent UN objectivity. While any definitive U.S. ruling on the report has yet to come, Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, has already questioned the mandate Goldstone received from the U.N.’s Human Rights Council to even write the report as “unbalanced, one-sided, and basically unacceptable.”
As should be clear by now, the report, which concluded that Israel directly targeted civilian areas during the three-week Gaza War earlier this year, was essentially a foregone conclusion; the four allegedly “neutral” investigators used the report as a vessel for advancing the typical anti-Israel agenda we have come to expect from the United Nations over the years.
Yes, it is true that the report also deems a war crime the Palestinian rocket fire from Gaza into Southern Israel. But a cursory glance at just the index of the 575-page document reveals that such an item—a miniscule part of the whole—hardly fits at all with the larger themes of the “balanced” document, balanced only in its different biases toward Israel.
At this point, those who still believe the report to have any shred of credibility need only look as far as Christine Chinkin, a professor at the London School of Economics and one of the Goldstone Report’s four investigators, who signed a letter to The London Times accusing Israel of war crimes on January 11, 2009, 10 days before Israel even withdrew from Gaza to conclude the war. With Chinkin, we see an “unbiased” observer who had made up her mind far before participating in the investigation— and before the shooting had even stopped. Israel may have committed war crimes in Gaza, but with such a predisposition on the part of its investigators, how could such an enterprise as the Goldstone Report ever be called “balanced”? Moreover, how could the report ever be seen as credible?
Here we arrive at the one little fact that makes this particular report different from most of the other anti-Israel biases floating through the ether—and that, of course, is its author’s name. Richard Goldstone, who headed the investigation, is himself a Jew. For some, a Jewish imprimatur emblazoned on an Israeli-criticizing report’s title page lends its contents some instant credibility.
As the noted Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz has written, those who support the Goldstone Report do so not by drawing on the contents of the report but merely by pointing to the author. “Had Richard Goldstone, a distinguished judge and a prominent Jew, not been the author of the United Nations Human Rights Council,” Dershowitz wrote recently, “it would be tossed in the trash barrel along with other one-sided and biased reports by this prejudice group with targets only Israel for human rights violations.”
Hence the difficulty in convincing the world of the Goldstone Report’s inherent bias; hence its remarkably pervasive credibility, even after items like Chinkin’s letter to The London Times have, at least in the minds of cognizant individuals, exposed the report’s farcical attempts at balance as what they are—words alone.  “After all, if a Jew wrote it,” the thinking goes, “then it must be true.”
But the assumption that the Goldstone Report is credible merely because its author happens to be Jewish is deeply problematic. To cite Goldstone’s Jewishness as the basis of his report’s credibility is to assume first that all Jews think alike and second that he should be celebrated for rising above what the world unfortunately perceives to be the “Jewish position” of unconditional support for Israel.
It is important to remember that not all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, but this particular way of thinking implies a certain type of prejudice rarely applied to other Middle Eastern countries. Since when has it been acceptable to posit that all Jews think alike and that, in that sense, Goldstone should be praised for not “thinking like a Jew” and defending Israel? To that effect, many Jews worldwide do not fit the pro-Israel mold, a belief that the report’s proponents seem to harbor.
We can all agree that there are certain organizations that, in a bizarre way, relish any opportunity to criticize Israel whatsoever. But the fact that the UN seems to have allowed the Goldstone Report—and its Jewish name—to be used as a means for concealing its typical groundless scorn for Israel is perhaps the most troubling aspect of the entire affair, aside from the potential war crimes themselves.
So much for objectivity.

Even Antonin “Just ’Cause You’re Innocent Doesn’t Mean We Can’t Execute You” Scalia sometimes has good ideas. This spring, during the first set of oral arguments in the controversial “Hillary: The Movie” campaign-finance case, Justice Scalia floated a novel constitutional approach that would favor the Hillary-hating movie producers but also provide campaign-finance laws with a stronger footing—at least in my estimation. Because everyone knows Scalia didn’t really mean it, his suggestion has gotten short shrift among mainstream commentators. That’s a shame, because Scalia’s idea, even though it probably won’t be reflected in the final decision, reminds us why we want campaign-finance laws in the first place.
First, a little background. McCain-Feingold prohibits using corporate funds to produce and distribute “electioneering communications” in the heat of an election season, and “Hillary: The Movie” is pretty clearly the sort of communication the law had in mind. As Justice Breyer clucked, “it is not a musical comedy,” but rather political advocacy tantamount to saying, “Don’t (for the love of God) vote for Hillary Clinton.” Ditching their attempt to mischaracterize their own film, the producers refocused the court’s attention on the broad constitutional question: Shouldn’t corporations be allowed to spend and say whatever they want in the hopes of influencing an election?
Thus prompted, everyone involved went into battle mode, taking sides on a question that has been settled, in the negative, for over 100 years. But all five conservative justices might not be willing to eliminate all restrictions on corporate spending, and in any case such a decision would hurt the Roberts Court’s pretensions to deference and modesty. So Justice Scalia suggested that they split the baby: Perhaps communications, like “Hillary: The Movie,” that reach their audience through its direct consent should receive “heightened” First Amendment protection. This would give movies and books a special status relative to, say, television commercials and pop-up ads.
Such a rule would be conceptually consistent with the court’s free-speech precedents. Just last term, a five-man conservative majority held that the government may forbid and punish the airing of “fleeting expletives, on the grounds that sensitive viewers could not avoid broadcast obscenity even if they tried. If you want to listen to George Carlin, the court has said, buy the record and play it in your home; don’t expect to hear it on the radio when kids or non-consenting adults might be listening.
Dismayingly, the Obama administration’s stance in the present case threatens even this limited right to choose what you want to hear, see, or read. In the spring, the government lawyer told the court that the government could ban even a campaign biography, if funded with corporate money, under McCain-Feingold. Even a purely informative documentary, if supplemented with a brief statement in support of a candidate, would count as an “electioneering communication.” These implications, unconvincingly recanted during the second set of oral arguments last month, clearly would violate the First Amendment—not because they interfere with corporate “speech,” but because they get between a willing listener/viewer/reader and the communications he or she is seeking out.
But can one really justify interfering with speech to which the audience has not consented, like political TV ads? Wouldn’t that endanger public protests, which are at the heart of the First Amendment? Liberals recoil at the thought: Surely we still want to protect the man who walked through a courthouse wearing a jacket that said “F--- the Draft,” even though he forced many people to imbibe a message that they found offensive. The rationale for protecting that man is illuminating: It rested on a distinction between public spaces, where one should expect to run into some offensive messages, and the “sanctuary of the home.” We don’t want the government adjudicating every dispute over unwanted public speech. But unwanted communications that penetrate into our living rooms are different: The right to privacy and autonomy in that most personal space takes precedence.
The implications for campaign-finance reform are clear. Corporate electioneering is objectionable not merely because it is corporate, as many liberals assume. It’s the form that this electioneering often takes: invading the home, confronting people with compelling images and scary music, and affecting their votes in the process. If citizens want to see a Hillary-bashing movie, more power to them; consensual viewing couldn’t possibly distort an election. But that’s not true of 30-second spots and unsolicited mailers screaming about Candidate X’s filthy lies or about how Candidate Y wants to kill Granny.
Liberals should remember that we want campaign-finance laws in order to protect voters’ decision-making from influence by corporations, whose spending bears no relation to any pre-existing public support for their positions. Their purpose is not to forbid voters from accessing messages that they deem agreeable. Surprisingly, it took Antonin Scalia to remind us of that.

Family and friends of Samuel H. Beer, a former Harvard professor of government who passed away in April, gathered last Friday to celebrate his life during a service at the Memorial Church.
Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes officiated the service, and the event included speeches by colleagues and students who had worked closely with Beer throughout his time at the University.
All of the eulogies emphasized a common theme: not only was Beer an accomplished academic, but he also cared about the people who he collaborated with.
“We remember not only what he did, but also who he was and what he represented to the rest of us,” Gomes said. “He took us seriously, but not himself too seriously—a rare and precious quality for a Harvard professor.”
Following a hymn at the beginning of the service, Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, who first took a course with Beer as sophomore at the College, recalled the first time that the two met.Mansfield remembered Beer as a professor who taught with passion and “made his points with fists rather than with fingers.”
Former colleagues also praised Beer’s ability to engage students with the course materials. Melvin Richter ’43, who served as a teaching fellow in one of Beer’s famous courses, Social Sciences 2, said that the course was of a “strikingly original format” in which Beer would evaluate two opposing theories for each of the six political events addressed in the course.
Richter added that Beer was “a quite wonderful and irreplaceable man who enriched the lives of those who were lucky enough to know him.”Other speakers remembered Beer’s experiences before he came to Harvard.
Government Professor Peter A. Hall recalled that before entering the world of academia, Beer was a decorated veteran of World War II. Beer landed at Normandy five days after D-Day and was awarded a Bronze Star for fighting in close proximity to enemy lines.
Hall said that Beer was a man who “cared just as much about that sophomore who walked through that wooden door in that basement office in Littauer” as he did about prime ministers, senators, and diplomats.
“What is most remarkable about Sam Beer is the example he set for us as a person,” Hall said.

This year’s Ig Nobel Prize winners gathered for an evening of funny and thought-provoking speeches at MIT on Saturday afternoon for the Ig Nobel Prize lectures.
The informal lectures followed Thursday’s 19th annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, but added a new twist to the quirky distinction.Joined on stage by a young child identified only as “Miss Sweetie Poo,” the speakers were routinely interrupted approximately five minutes into their speeches by the girls’s cries of “Please stop, I’m bored!”
For the event’s signature feature, an official time keeper activated a chain of elbow nudges from within the audience which finally culminated with Miss Sweetie Poo’s comical exclamation just seconds later.
During the event, each winner or winning team gave the audience insights into the logistics and implications of their research.Projects ranged from the effect of naming cows on their milk production to determining whether it is better to be hit with a full bottle of beer or an empty bottle during a fight.
Elena N. Bodnar, one of the winners of the Public Health prize, gave a talk entitled “Convertible Bra Mask—Life Saving Lingerie” where she described her invention of a brassiere that can be converted into two gas masks in an emergency. According to Bodnar, technology can be manufactured without affecting the product’s original function.
After each presentation the winners answered both serious and silly questions from the audience. “How much tequila do I have to give to my boyfriend in order to receive a diamond?” one audience member asked Javier Morales, Miguel Apatiga and Victor M. Castano of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, the winners of the Chemistry prize who had discovered how to convert tequila into diamonds.
Several members of the audience said that they were left with the impression that the research, though entertainingly presented, held serious potential for the advancement of particular fields.
“It was hilarious but it got you thinking,” said Roberto Melendez, a sophomore at MIT, who attended the lectures. “Some prizes may have been for fun but others actually have practical uses.”
Hanna L. Luchnikava, another audience member, said that she thought the discoveries had “serious implications,” for further research in many areas.
“It was good that it was presented in a fun way,” she added.

artners in Health gathered local residents and worldwide PIH workers on Saturday for the 16th Annual Thomas J. White Symposium to “celebrate the year’s achievements and strategize for the future,” according to Ophelia Dahl, PIH Executive Director. PIH—a Harvard-affiliated nonprofit organization with partners in Latin America, Africa, and Russia—was founded in 1987 by Paul Farmer, Thomas J. White, and Todd McCormack. They were later joined by Dahl and Jim Y. Kim, who recently left Harvard to become the President of Dartmouth University.The symposium brought together PIH doctors, volunteers, and project leaders who work for social justice and health care to highlight this year’s theme of “Solidarity in Action,” shown in the power of accompaniment.The event opened with a somber tone as three speakers gave a tribute to Dr. Josue Augustin, the director of surgery for PIH’s partner organization in Haiti, whose murder on August 31st, 2009 remains unsolved.Mourning the loss of Augustin, Dr. Joia Mukherjee, Chief Medical Officer for PIH described him as “a gifted surgeon and an exceptional human being...the only surgeon in Haiti who would treat anyone, from anywhere, at anytime, regardless of their ability to pay.” Mukherjee said PIH hopes to continue his dream of making surgery accessible to all Haitians.The afternoon’s featured speaker was Nicholas D. Kristof ’82, a two-time Pulitzer Price winner columnist for the New York Times who was also a Crimson news editor.“My only hesitation coming here was that I remember Sanders Theater from taking Ec 10 in this room,” Kristof said, drawing laughter from audience members.Kristof, whose research regarding the social injustice women face in East Asian countries is chronicled in his new book “Half the Sky.” He urged audience members to partake in “a cause larger than ourselves.”“Helping people is harder than it looks,” Kristof said. “At the same time, it’s important to acknowledge that many projects have been completely successful and transformative.”The symposium concluded on an uplifting note with a photo slide show of past projects, played to the song “I Shall Believe” by Sheryl Crow.Audience members, many of whom traveled from countries including Haiti, Rwanda, Peru, and Russia, said they felt inspired by the speakers and the stories.“I was so involved with numbers and Excel that I had little time to do home visits,” said Odile Nzirabatinya, the Chief Financial Officer for the PIH sister organization in Rwanda. “Now, I feel more energized to be more involved with field work.”Several Harvard students who managed to snag tickets to the sold-out event expressed similar sentiment.“Social justice has always been a burden on my heart,” said Desta S. Lissanu ’13. “I’m Ethiopian...I really feel an obligation to help my people, and I’m trying to find a way to fulfill that.”—Staff writer Helen X. Yang can be reached at hxyang@fas.harvard.

A few hundred people crowded inside of Geological Lecture Hall on Saturday night to hear tales of New Guinea birds and Tibetan antelopes from National Geographic photographer Timothy G. Laman and renowned alpinist Conrad Anker.
The event was co-sponsored by the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH) and the National Geographic Society (NGS), and was an extension of the National Geographic Young Explorers Grant Workshop.
The workshop, which was earlier in the day, introduced previous grant recipients, NGS explorers and photographers, to more than 100 potential grant applicants. The Young Explorers Grant Program is intended to help fund research, conservation and exploration projects for people between the ages of 18 and 25.
“People need to know that National Geographic isn’t just a magazine,” said John M. Francis, vice president for research, conservation, and exploration at NGS. “It is an empowering organization.”
Laman, an ornithology research associate in the Museum of Comparative Zoology who received his Ph.D. in biology from the University in 1994, spoke about his “Birds of the Paradise” project in New Guinea. As part of his project, he photographed native New Guinea birds—many of which had never been photographed before.
Renowned alpinist Anker, who discovered the long-lost body of English mountaineer George Mallory on Mount Everest in 1999, discussed his expedition to Tibet’s Chang Tang Plateau in search of the calving grounds of the Tibetan antelope. Also known as the chiru, the endangered animal is often hunted for its fine wool.
“The pressure that luxury items was having on wildlife was made obvious to us,” he said.
According to the HMNH Assistant Director of Public Programs Tom Scanlon, the museum hoped to promote an appreciation for the natural world among the student body and the public through the workshop and lecture.
“The partnership with National Geographic is a real natural and exciting opportunity for Harvard and the Museum to help foster a new generation of explorers,” Scanlon said.
Past beneficiaries of the Young Explorers Grant were also present at the event, including Katherine R. Amato, a 2007 graduate Dartmouth College who used the grant to do field work on howler monkeys in Mexico.
“There are a lot of opportunities in ecology right now that are interdisciplinary,” she said.

Several users of “@college” and “@law” e-mail accounts have experienced service interruptions since last Tuesday as a result of a glitch that caused many e-mails forwarded from these accounts to Gmail to experience severe delays.
“The issue is due primarily to the way that Gmail deals with large volumes of e-mail coming from a single source,” said Faculty of Arts and Sciences IT Client Technology Advisor Noah S. Selsby ’94-’95 in an e-mailed statement to the Crimson. “Because so many students forward mail from their @college and @law accounts to Gmail, Gmail incorrectly identifies it as spam (probably because of the large volume of mail coming from the same provider).”
Both of these accounts are provided by Mail2World, a private Los Angeles-based web-services company.
Anusha Tomar ’11 said that she did not recieve mail from her Harvard account for about eight hours. “There were emails that I was waiting for and expecting that weren’t showing up. Once I realized that nothing was getting forwarded, I just started keeping my @college inbox open.”
Cindy C. Cheng ’10 said she was frustrated after a company that she applied to through Harvard’s e-recruiting program e-mailed her to schedule a phone call while her e-mail service was disrupted. “I received the e-mail at 3:00 a.m. the next morning,” said Cheng, who is also an inactive Crimson editor. She estimated that only half of the e-mails received at her @college e-mail account were being forwarded to her Gmail inbox.
In a notice posted to their Web site on Thursday morning, FAS IT recommended that e-mail accounts that forward e-mail to Gmail be configured so that a copy of all messages remain on @college server.
“Thankfully, when forwarding my e-mails to my Gmail account, I kept copies in my @college inbox,” Tomar said. “If not, I’d have lost several [messages] before I realized that there was a problem.”
According to Selsby, FAS IT and the Law School have submitted requests to Gmail to white-list @college and @law accounts to prevent further mail from being classified as spam. “Unfortunately, Gmail’s white-listing mechanism is automated and the white-list requests have not yet been executed,” Selsby wrote on Friday. “The turnaround time for such requests takes 24-48 hours. While the white-list request process is fully automated, we have reached out to the education representative at Google and are currently working to see if we can get the request expedited.”

The three-week Trial Advocacy Workshop (TAW), which was conducted at Harvard Law School this semester, culminated in simulated trials last week with high school and undergraduate students serving as jurors.
The workshop, which was organized by the Criminal Justice Institute, was aimed at helping Law School students improve their ability to analyze a trial and to present effectively before a jury.
The Law School students, who spent the first two weeks preparing for the case, served as attorneys and witnesses during the third week of the workshop and received critiques from experienced trial lawyers and judges. Student performances were also video-taped and individually critiqued.
During the case, jurors heard a simulated criminal trial in which they were asked to determine whether or not the deaths of a man and a woman were a double-suicide or double-homicide committed by a jilted lover. After an hour-long deliberation, jurors acquitted the defendant.
Jay D. Blitzman, First Justice of the Middlesex Juvenile Court, served as presiding judge. Blitzman praised the performance of the Harvard Law School students at the conclusion of the trial.
He emphasized the effectiveness of closing arguments, which interwove the underlying themes of jealousy, infatuation, and revenge in the case.
“I’m very excited by what I saw,” he said.
“I wanted to see how good you all are. Now I wish that I could take you all to court on Monday,” Blitzman added.
The volunteer jurors, ranging from Harvard undergraduates to local high school students, also offered opinions on individual aspects of the Harvard Law School students’ performances. Jurors commented on the logic presented to the jury and the strength of opening and closing arguments.
“The proceedings were quite good,” said Christian E. Chauvet ’12 after the conclusion of the trials.
“I thought the defense was very persuasive and the statements were very well-prepared,” Chauvet added.
The jury was partially composed of members from the Harvard Mock Trial team and mock trial teams in the local community. According to Chauvet, it provided valuable exposure to other means of approaching simulated jury trials.
All undergraduates interested in serving as jurors are encouraged to volunteer, according to Anna Pierce, who is the  administrative coordinator of the Criminal Justice Institute.
The TAW will be held again during the winter term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cabot House senior Ariel E.F. Shaker ’10 remains in critical condition, according to Boston Medical Center’s communications office, after she was injured last Thursday when she was thrown from a horse that then fell on her.
Shaker was injured while she and another student were practicing at Pony Express in Ipswich, Mass., according to The Salem News. Police told the newspaper that Shaker was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.
Shaker was taken by helicopter to Boston Medical Center with extensive internal bleeding in her head, according to an e-mail sent to Harvard Polo Club members by coach Crocker Snow Jr. ’61 early Friday morning.
Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris informed Shaker’s Housemates of her injury in an e-mail sent to Cabot House residents late Thursday night.Most of the Harvard Polo Club was practicing at the Myopia Hunt Club in South Hamilton, Mass. at the time of the accident, though two other team members were with Shaker at Pony Express, Snow told The Salem News.
Massachusetts General Hospital doctor Leslie W. Milne, a specialist in emergency and sports medicine, organized the emergency response to Shaker’s injury. Along with Milne, patrolman Joe Perna, Action Ambulance personnel Warren Mayhew and Marc Haigh, and Ipswich firefighter Jeff Stone performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Shaker before she was taken to Boston Medical Center by emergency helicopter.
“She’s a good rider. She’s an experienced rider,” Snow told The Salem News. “Obviously, something highly unusual happened.”
Snow declined to speak with The Crimson about the accident.
A group of Shaker’s family, friends, roommates, and teammates have been with Shaker at the hospital since her accident.
“Her friends have been amazingly strong—spending a lot of time at the hospital, supporting one another, and supporting Ariel’s family,” wrote Cabot House Resident Dean Jill Constantino in an e-mailed statement.
Women’s Polo Club captain Alexandra “Za” C. Tilt ’10 said that, in keeping with the wishes of Ariel’s mother, the men’s team went through with today’s planned game against Yale, which Harvard won 13-11.
A Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator with a secondary field in English from Palo Alto, Calif., Shaker only recently joined the Polo Club, though she has long been a fan of riding horses.
Shaker also serves as the Resource Efficiency Program representative for Cabot House.
Prior to joining the Polo Club, Shaker was a member of the women’s Heavyweight Crew team.
Tilt wrote in an e-mail that the Harvard administration has been “amazingly supportive of Ariel, her family, her friends, and the members of the polo team throughout this tough situation, which has been greatly appreciated by all.”
“The thoughts of our community are with the student, as well as her friends and family,” wrote FAS spokesman Jeff A. Neal in an e-mailed statement.

The Graduate School of Design honored the late J. Max Bond Jr. ’55, who was one of the first African American graduates of the GSD as well as a prominent architect and educator, with a panel that focused on his work on Friday.
Bond died of cancer in February of this year at the age of 73 and was the country’s most influential African American architect.
Students, teachers, friends and colleagues gathered to discuss Bond’s achievements and contributions to American architecture and how his work can be further incorporated into the GSD curriculum.
In 1980, he was appointed to the New York City Planning Commission by Mayor Ed I. Koch—a post he held until 1986. Bond lived and worked in New York City at the time of his death, and was responsible for the National September 11th Museum at the World Trade Center.
Throughout his life, he completed projects such as the renovation of the Harvard Club of New York City, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta, and the Harvard Institutes of Medicine building in Cambridge.
The panel discussion emphasized Bond’s influence on architectural pedagogy. Bond frequently demonstrated his belief in the role of architecture as a means of transforming society through advocacy and public service.
His colleagues called him both a terrific architect and a visionary leader.
“Max [Bond’s] influence is interesting because he worked not just in a community, but for and with a community,” said panelist Craig Barton, an architecture professor at the University of Virginia and a Loeb Fellow at the GSD.
The speakers emphasized that Bond’s legacy as a socially aware architect still resonates today.
“We are educating the next generation of leaders who are going to make social, physical change,” Barton explained to the audience.
Bond earned his bachelor’s degree in architecture in 1955 from Harvard College and his master’s degree in architecture three years later from the Graduate School of Design.
A renowned educator, Bond served as a professor at Columbia University from 1968 to 1984 and as dean of the School of Architecture and Environmental Studies at the City College of New York from 1985 to 1992.
Friday’s panel was hosted in conjunction with an exhibit in the Gund Hall Lobby honoring Bond’s work. The exhibit will be displayed until October 18.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School was founded in the midst of a recession in 1908. More than 100 years later, during similarly trying financial times, the Business School, its students and faculty are in the hot seat.
As failures in the financial sector took down the larger economy last year, many critics blamed the MBAs working at major financial firms for the current economic recession.
The problem, some say, is that many MBA students come to business school for the wrong reasons.
One of these critics, Philip Delves Broughton who is a 2006 graduate of HBS, says that business school students find that their experience is more geared toward networking than educating competent managers. Broughton wrote a book which was recently published in 2008 that fleshed out his criticism of his experience at the school.
Now, some HBS faculty members are introducing new courses and updating existing ones to respond to the gaps in management education that many say the crisis has revealed.
Classes at the Business School are predominantly taught by examining case studies. And according to HBS Dean Jay O. Light, a number of classes have added new cases to their curricula in response to the financial crisis.
The required first-year course “Business, Government, and the International Economy,” plans to add cases on the sudden demise of the Icelandic banking system and on the effect of this recent economic crisis in the developing world, according to course head Rawi E. Abdelal.
But several professors are making more significant changes of their own accord. Though the school’s administration had no direct role in the formation of these courses, several new second-year elective classes focusing on various aspects of the financial crisis have been introduced since 2008.
MANAGING FINANCIALS
Clayton S. Rose, a senior lecturer at the Business School, had been contemplating a course on the management of financial institutions long before the crisis. But the recession proved to be the impetus he needed to turn his thoughts into reality.
“The real work began when it became clear that things were fundamentally changing,” Rose says. “The course was shaped very fundamentally by the financial crisis.”
Rose’s second-year elective, “Managing the Financial Firm,” debuted this semester. It introduces students to many of the new challenges affecting financial organizations in today’s economic environment, including increased regulation and public scrutiny.
After spending 20 years as an executive at JP Morgan Chase, Rose saw the need to educate managers specifically in the field of finance. After the banking crisis began, Rose added cases on Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, whose collapse is widely viewed as a symbol of the current crisis.
Rose invited several Wall Street analysts and a former director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission to speak to the class.
Among the points he seeks to make to his students, Rose says, is that public opinion of a firm is important.
“It’s necessary to have the perception of confidence,” he says. “If you lose that, your firm fails.”
REPEATING HISTORY
Certain courses that were created before the crisis have taken on new meaning in the recession.
“Creating the Modern Financial System,” a course taught by Professor David A. Moss, debuted in the Spring of 2008 just as the sub-prime mortgage crisis was evolving into a larger economic meltdown.
The students, who numbered about 30 in 2008, found the material—a history of finance—pertinent to the current events of developments on Wall Street. Student discussion often drifted towards the news, Moss says.
In the Spring of 2009, Moss added two case studies relating to the current crisis to the course, which he began formulating over four years ago. He will teach those cases again when the course is offered in the Spring of 2010.
Throughout its chronology, the course focuses on bubbles and crashes, Moss says. “People have joked that this is a course on destroying the modern financial system.”
Over the past two years, that focus has attracted more students.
The course—which enrolls a maximum of 90 students—was substantially oversubscribed when offered in 2009.
Moss says financial history gives students a better perspective on how finance works in reality, in addition to explaining how various aspects of the current crisis came about.
Summer M. Nemeth, a 2009 HBS graduate who took Moss’ class last year, agrees.
“[Moss] drew comparisons between the crazy current crisis and past crises. Not everyone has a direct mirror to today, but with every historical case, he pulled out insights that will be relevant going forward.”
CONSUMER FINANCE
As the recession gripped the economy in the winter of 2009, Business School Professor Peter Tufano ’79 was beginning a new joint class on consumer finance with Law School Professor Howell E. Jackson.
According to Tufano, the course, which will be offered in spring 2010, attempts to fill an educational void by introducing business students to consumer banking. Though Tufano envisioned the course before the downturn, the lack of educational resources on the topic became more evident during the banking crisis, he says.
Through its collaboration with the Law School, the course addresses the heavy regulation of the industry, an issue that the two professors often differed on, Tufano and Jackson say.
Jon P. Swan, who took the class before graduating from HBS last year, says he feels like he has benefitted from the course. One of his favorite cases was about a couple with a sub-prime mortgage losing their home.
“What was neat was picking up the Wall Street Journal everyday and finding something directly related to what we were doing in class,” Swan says.
'TWEAKS'
The criticism and curricular changes are not limited to Harvard Business School. Several elite business schools from around the country are making “tweaks” similar to those at HBS, with individual faculty members taking the lead.
At the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, students will be able to take the new course “The Analytics of Financial Crises” as well as new courses on ethics and social responsibility. Yale School of Management has added a first-year core curriculum course entitled “The Global Macroeconomy,” as well as several electives.
“Our approach has not been monolithic change from the top down. Tons of things are bubbling up in response” to the crisis,” says JoAnne Yates, deputy dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management, which is considering implementing a required ethics course.
The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth has taken a more robust approach, with a full curricular review and the implementation of a core leadership course and a seminar in critical analysis, according to an e-mail from Tuck Dean Paul Danos.
“Here we are aiming at honing an open and questioning mind, that is eager to probe and challenge—actions that were sorely lacking by certain officials and regulators in the financial markets.” Danos says.
Still, Broughton remains critical of the school’s response in favor of what he sees as a need for more comprehensive change.
“Anyone who doesn’t live within a mile of the Charles River sees the problem with a business school philosophy that has harmed a lot of people,” Broughton says. “They’ll have to do more than offer a handful of electives to change that.”

A male faculty member reported that he was robbed at gunpoint by an unknown man while walking north of the Divinity School at 10:15 p.m. on Saturday, according to a community advisory e-mailed by The Harvard University Police Department on Sunday evening. 
The advisory states that the unidentified victim was near the intersection of Eustis and Oxford St. when a man allegedly approached him and asked him for the time.
The man then allegedly “displayed a handgun and demanded the faculty member’s wallet,” before taking it and fleeing down Oxford St., leaving the victim uninjured.
The Cambridge Police Department, rather than the HUPD, is investigating the incident because it did not occur on University property.
Street robberies increased by 23% to 74 incidents in Cambridge during the first six months of this year compared to the first half of 2008, according to the CPD’s second quarter crime report for 2009. 
HUPD reiterated in the advisory that Harvard is an urban campus, which deals with many of the same crime and safety issues found in other cities. The notice urged students, faculty, and staff to exercise caution when walking at night by remaining in well-lit areas and refraining from listening to music, talking on cellphones, or walking unnecessarily close to strangers.
Yesterday’s advisory was the first since an announcement of an unarmed robbery on Putnam St. at the beginning of the school year. 
Six robberies were reported in community advisories last school year, three of them armed, according to the HUPD online archive of advisories.
The Public Information Officers for both HUPD and CPD were not available for comment as of press time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BETHLEHEM, Penn.—The saga of Cheng Ho follows an inconsistent yet captivating trajectory, repeatedly thrusting its protagonist into the spotlight only to plunge him back into obscurity. It is a story of adversity and Ho’s irrepressible determination to overcome it; a tale of hard work and hard luck that strikes a positive tone only because of the Harvard senior running back’s relentless optimism.
In the Crimson’s 28-14 win over Lehigh on Saturday, Ho emerged as the Crimson offense’s most effective weapon, working like a skilled veteran boxer to wear down his opponent. Rather than swinging wildly in hopes of landing a knockout blow, he executed short, swift strikes—five yards here, eight yards there—which accumulated and left the Mountain Hawks standing, but incapable of mounting any sort of counterattack in the contest’s waning stages.
By the time Ho left the field with cramps late in the third quarter, he had led Harvard to such a commanding advantage that, while he could have returned, it was unnecessary to push him much further and his action was limited for the rest of the game. But even in an abbreviated showing, his line was impressive—132 rushing yards and a score on 21 carries along with a 13-yard touchdown reception.
“We certainly rode him today—not just his productivity but his emotion,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He gave us a lot of juice on offense, a lot of leadership.”
But Ho’s performance was just one high point in a complicated journey that has seen the tailback become one of the most recognizable athletes on campus but delve in and out of visibility on the field.
Its beginnings are well documented. Ho emerged on the college football scene in 2006, an unknown freshman somehow serving as the primary backup for the Crimson’s all-time rushing leader—Clifton Dawson ’07.
Media inquiries into the origins of Dawson’s heir apparent led to the discovery of his remarkable personal story. Following family tragedy, Ho came to the United States from Taiwan along with his sister at age 12 to live with his aunt and uncle in Georgia. He had never heard of football and didn’t speak English, yet here he was just a few years later carrying the pigskin at Harvard.
The plot, worthy of an inspirational made-for-TV movie, seemed destined for a predictable ending—after overcoming obstacles, Ho goes on to a successful career as Harvard’s starting tailback, finishing in a blaze of glory in his senior year as he stomps all over Yale in The Game.
But things haven’t been that simple.
After a stellar sophomore campaign in which Ho filled the starter’s role admirably—running for 745 yards and scoring seven touchdowns—he lost most of his junior season to injuries.
This year, Murphy filled the top of his depth chart with more athletic options in junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales, relegating Ho to the bench.
“There are a lot of different guys on the team this year, and obviously it’s frustrating not to be able to play,” Ho said.
But while frustration is an emotion Ho has become all too familiar with, apathy is not.
A 5’10, 190-pound spark plug, Ho radiates like an inextinguishable candle. He operates with the same level of energy whether he’s pacing the sidelines at one of his games or firing up the crowd at another team’s contest during the football offseason (Go to a Harvard basketball game—men’s or women’s—and you should be able to spot Ho within seconds, even if you’ve never seen him before).
But Ho’s intensity is most noticeable when he’s playing, and while he hasn’t had many opportunities to do so recently, he’s never gotten discouraged. When an injury sidelined Gordon and a family matter called Scales home before Saturday’s game, Ho was as ready as he’s ever been.
“Coach Murphy came up to me after the Brown game [last Friday night] and said ‘Hang in there, your time will come,’ and I really listened,” Ho said. “I knew the team needed me today...And I know this: There’s one shot and this might be my only shot, and I just knew I had to take advantage of it.”
Take advantage he did, and emphatically so. Not only did Ho give the Crimson the performance it needed from him, he also made a strong case to play a larger role in Harvard’s Ivy League title role this season. Who knows, maybe he’ll get that storybook ending after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BETHLEHEM, Penn.—As the Harvard football team prepared to take the field at Lehigh on Saturday, the Crimson faced uncertainties regarding its banged-up defense, especially in the wake of season-ending injuries to senior Ryan Burkhead and junior Ben Graeff.
Despite the losses, Harvard’s depth of talent has stepped up.
“I think it really starts with our defensive staff—[it] has really done a great job of getting some young kids ready to play, that we hadn’t thought we’d be playing so soon, especially at the defensive end position,” Murphy said. “You also factor in that we have a lot of veteran linebackers but not many have been front-line players. I think they’ve done a good job.”
The defense notched four interceptions Saturday, with junior Collin Zych picking a pair of passes, senior Ryan Barnes snatching one of his own, and senior Jon Takamura returning an interception for 60 yards and a touchdown.
“[Defensive coordinator Scott] Larkee had us well-prepared this week,” Takamura said. “So I just saw the fullback flare out for a screen, and I just read it, got under it, got lucky. The quarterback threw the ball, and I just surrounded the ball and ended up in the endzone.”
RUNNING DEEP
The key to Harvard’s offense has long been its balance. The questions looming around junior Collier Winters’ campaign as Crimson quarterback centered on whether he could supply the balance to the passing side that Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 offered in Harvard’s back-to-back Ivy championship seasons. So far, Winters has met that challenge adeptly.
But Saturday’s contest against Lehigh had spectators wondering about the other side of the Crimson’s balanced offense—the run game.
Harvard’s regular starting running back, junior Gino Gordon, was sidelined with an injury. Though Crimson coach Tim Murphy would not go into specifics, Gordon was dressed to play.
“He should be fine,” Murphy said of Gordon. “I mean, we could have used him today, but like I said, we’ve got the luxury of depth so we could rest him.”
Also, according to Murphy, Harvard’s second-string back, rookie Treavor Scales, returned home to Georgia to attend to a death in the family.
That left the Crimson’s offense with its number three, senior Cheng Ho. Ho, who missed most of last year due to injury, was Harvard’s starter two years ago, and on Saturday he returned to form. He rushed for 132 yards and a touchdown, and caught a 13-yard touchdown reception.
“We didn’t have our number one, we didn’t have our number two, and Cheng’s a guy we’ve always been able to count on,” Murphy said.
CUTTING BACK
In last week’s nail-biter against Brown, the Crimson racked up 11 penalties resulting in 92 free yards for the Bears.
“Just penalties in general is a concern, and it will be addressed,” Murphy said after Harvard narrowly beat Brown, 24-21. “If you look at us traditionally, we’re a team that doesn’t beat itself. We don’t make a lot of mistakes.”
In Saturday’s contest against the Mountain Hawks, it appeared that those concerns had been addressed. Harvard accumulated only three penalties resulting in 23 yards. The defensive backfield maintained consistent pressure on the Lehigh receivers without drawing any flags—a nagging problem last week—as Harvard coasted to the 28-14 win.

BETHLEHEM, Penn.—In a contest that could have been a trap game for Harvard football, the only person that felt trapped was Lehigh quarterback Chris Lum.
The sophomore, who was making his first career start, was terrorized by the Crimson defense, which sacked him four times and picked off four of his passes.
Senior linebacker Jon Takamura ran back a fourth-quarter interception 60 yards for a touchdown to ice Harvard’s (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) 28-14 win over the Mountain Hawks (0-4, 0-0 Patriot) Saturday in a non-conference matchup at Goodman Stadium.
“I think the combination of [good coaching and veteran leadership] has given us a lot of energy on defense, a lot of leadership on defense,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We’re a very solid unit right now.”
With six minutes to play in the game, Lum attempted a screen pass on third and 10. But a blitzing Takamura read the play to perfection, pulling down the ball and finding an open lane to the endzone.
“I just had my sights on the endzone, and I was going to get there one way or another,” Takamura said. “I saw [Lum] coming at me, and he had a great angle. So I felt like I had room to cut it back—normally, we’re taught not to cut it back, but I had the room to. Once I saw him slide, I knew I had it.”
But it was simply the flashiest play from a defensive unit that only allowed Lehigh across midfield five times during the game.
“I felt our coaches had us very well-prepared for the Lehigh offense—and give them credit, they came out and played hard,” said Takamura, who finished with seven tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a pick. “But we really made plays, a lot of plays. We’re playing with a great group of guys on defense right now, so we just have to keep rolling.”
The Mountain Hawks, who were looking to avoid their first 0-4 start since the 1982 season, got off on the right foot. On the first drive of the game, Lum took his team 83 yards to an early lead.
On a 3rd-and-goal play, the quarterback hit junior tight end Alex Wojdowski for a one-yard touchdown pass. An extra point from kicker Tom Randazza made the score 7-0 in favor of the home team.
But that was the last time Lehigh would threaten until the fourth quarter, and the Crimson offense took advantage of the opportunities handed to it by the defense.
Senior Ryan Barnes made Harvard’s first pick of the day late in the first quarter, putting the Crimson on its own 37-yard line. And from there, the tag team of junior quarterback Collier Winters and senior running back Cheng Ho led the drive that would even the score.
Ho, Harvard’s third-string running back, got his first start of the season with junior Gino Gordon injured and freshman Treavor Scales away for a family funeral. And Ho seized the opportunity, running for 132 yards on 21 carries and scoring two of the Crimson’s touchdowns—one by air, one by land.
After Ho rushed for 13 yards early in the drive, he connected with Winters for a 13-yard touchdown pass with 12:46 remaining in the half.
But when the Mountain Hawks got the ball back, it was déja vu.
Lum once again took to the air, and once again his pass was intercepted—this time, by junior Collin Zych, who anchored the defense with two picks, two pass breakups, and six tackles.
Winters and his offense started driving from the Lehigh 38, and eight plays later, sophomore Adam Chrissis hauled in a three-yard catch for another score.
The two touchdowns were the highlights of an extremely productive second quarter for Harvard, which held the ball for more than 10 minutes and outgained Lehigh 162-35. The Crimson threatened once more in the waning seconds of the half, but senior Patrick Long’s 36-yard field goal attempt went wide right.
But Winters had his hands full with the Mountain Hawks’ defensive line, getting sacked six times. The junior finished with 152 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception while gaining no net yardage on the ground.
“Harvard’s a very big, physical football team,” Lehigh coach Andy Coen said. “But I thought, all in all, the defense played well enough that if offensively we were doing what we do, we would have had a chance to win the football game.”
Senior Matt Luft, the Crimson’s top receiver, missed the game with an injury, and Winters’ favorite target, junior Chris Lorditch, finished with just one catch for 13 yards—though a second-quarter catch that was ruled out-of-bounds should have been called a touchdown, according to video replay.
With Winters getting roughed up, it was the performance of Harvard’s two running backs, Ho and sophomore Demetrius Gadson, that carried the Crimson offense. Gadson finished with 52 yards on 14 carries.
Ho added another touchdown midway through the third frame, carrying the ball himself on the final three plays of the drive and capping it with a five-yard run to the endzone.
Up 21-7, the Crimson defense did not let up. With Lehigh on the Harvard 19-yard line, the Crimson stopped receiver Jake Drwal just inches short of a first down on an attempted fourth-down conversion. And though the Harvard offense wasn’t making much noise, Zych and Takamura ended Lehigh’s next two drives with interceptions.
“[Not finishing drives] is the thing of the day for us,” Lum said. “We’ve got to keep it going all the way and not stop.”
Lum was able to pull his offense together in the final quarter, capping an 80-yard drive with a one-yard run to make the final score 28-14.
But it was too little, too late for the Mountain Hawks, as the Crimson ate up the last 3:50 to seal the win.
“Right now, our strengths are that we’re pretty balanced as a team, we’re solid in every unit,” Murphy said. “And right now, effort. We’re doing a great job with effort.”

As the clock ticked on, counting down the minutes to midnight, it was do or die for the No. 8 Harvard men’s soccer team.
Two periods and an overtime had elapsed under a tumultuous black sky, as the Crimson battled its rival Bulldogs on Yale’s home turf during the Ivy League opener this past Saturday.  The whistle blew, signaling the beginning of the second extra period and the departure of the heavy rain that had plagued both teams for the entire game.
Harvard had been held scoreless for its second match in a row and desperately needed to end the stalemate—in other words, the Crimson needed a hero.
In the 102nd minute of play, freshman standout Brian Rogers answered his team’s prayers.  The 6’2 forward from Bronxville, N.Y. fired a shot into the left corner of the Bulldog’s net and simultaneously claimed the win for Harvard.
With Rogers’ goal, Harvard pulled out a 1-0 win over Yale, improving its record to 7-1 for the season.
“It was probably the highest point of my career at Harvard so far,” Rogers said.  “It’s hard to even describe.  That was the first goal of that kind that I’ve scored—it felt really good because I knew how much this game meant.”
But Rogers’ game-winning goal was hardly a solo effort.  Senior Adam Rousmaniere and co-captain Andre Akpan combined on the assist, with help from classmate and co-captain Brian Grimm at midfield.  The senior triumvirate was able to thwart the Yale defense, culminating in a pass to Rogers at the left post that allowed the freshman to seal the Crimson’s fate.
“It was absolutely [Grimm, Akpan and Rousmaniere] that combined on the goal to really set me up,” Rogers said.  “I just happened to be the one in front of the net to tap it home.”
While the Crimson deserved to celebrate its outstanding finish, the body of the game was less than extraordinary.  Harvard drastically outshot the Bulldogs, statistically outplaying its foe in every aspect of the contest, a fact that was hardly reflected in the final score.
The Crimson registered twenty-four shots on the night—with seven from Akpan alone—nine of which were on target.  Yale, on the other hand, recorded a meager eight shots with none on goal, leaving sophomore goaltender Austin Harms yawning in the Harvard net.
But even with this marked advantage, the Crimson and the Bulldogs remained tied at zero for a majority of the game.
“We were unable to capitalize on a lot of chances,” Grimm said.
Yet, despite this major gameday flaw, the senior captain was impressed with his team’s determination.
“We stuck with it and we were able to keep them from scoring,” Grimm added.  “[We] kept working to get our goal that we knew would come.”
Apart from being unable to find the net for a majority of the matchup despite numerous chances, Harvard was also plagued by penalties.  Junior Rob Millock was handed the Crimson’s first red card of the season at the beginning of the first overtime.
In what was a very physical match, the Bulldogs’ Chris Dennon also received a red card during the second half of the match, and Yale had two yellow cards on the night as well.
With these lost chances and debilitating penalties, the Crimson began to flounder a bit in the end of the second period.
“Towards the end of the second half we lost our composure a bit,” Rogers said.
But the Harvard seniors were able to lead the team to a late overtime win.
“[Grimm, Akpan and Rousmaniere] were able to really calm us down and get us playing the way we did in the first half,” Rogers added.
Pulling out a close win in New Haven, the Crimson will have to learn from its mistakes and eventual successes to prepare for its next matchup.  Harvard will host Holy Cross on Wednesday at Ohiri Field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it rains, Harvard scores. At least that was the case on Saturday when, on a soggy Jordan Field, the Crimson matched a season-high in goals en route to defeating Brown (3-6, 0-3 Ivy) in overtime, 4-3.
Coming off a four-game losing streak, Harvard (4-4, 1-2 Ivy) entered the match searching for its first Ivy League victory. It seized the win with junior forward Chloe Keating’s stick 1:28 into sudden death.
After a Bears turnover, sophomore midfielder Carly Dickson sent a pass ahead to Keating, who had only one defender between her and the goal. Inside the circle, Keating feinted left, sprinted right, and fired a shot past Brown goalie Caroline Washburn.
“I basically closed my eyes and swung away at it,” Keating said.
“What a beautiful goal to finish it on,” Crimson head coach Sue Caples said.
Keating’s tally capped off a wet and wild afternoon in which goals came early and often.
The scoring started eight minutes into the action after Harvard earned a penalty corner. Co-captain Kristen Bannon sent a pass to the top of the circle, which was then shuffled off to Dickson on the right wing. Dickson ripped a shot past Washburn into the lower right corner of the goal to give the Crimson an early lead.
“One of our major gameplans is to force as many corners as possible,” said Keating, “and we’re usually pretty good at finishing them.”
Minutes later, Harvard had another chance to get on the board. An infraction on a scrum in front of the Bears goal led to a penalty shot for the Crimson. Dickson took the shot and fired to Washburn’s glove side, but the Brown goalie swatted it away.
The Bears answered midway through the half with a deceptive play on a penalty corner of its own. After Brown forward Leslie Springmeyer sent a pass to teammate Michaela Seigo at the top of the circle, Seigo passed the ball to her left. Bears midfielder Katie Hyland stepped up and took a powerful swing at the ball but purposefully missed so that the pass rolled to Brown midfielder Whitney Knowlton. With the Harvard defense caught by surprise, Knowlton fired a shot into the back of the net to tie the game.
The Crimson reclaimed the lead 21 seconds later. After Dickson found Keating in the middle of the circle, Keating spun around and took a reverse shot at the left post. Sophomore forward Allie Kimmel swooped in and redirected Keating’s shot into the goal to make the score 2-1 going into the half.
“A lot of our shots on goal, seemed to be generated from the midfield, from Carly, and from corners,” Caples said.
The most influential factor might not have been any player but the weather itself. Steady rains soaked Jordan field and formed puddles along both sidelines. This drainage was a headache for Brown and Harvard and forced them to alter their tactics.
“The weather conditions played a factor for both teams,” Caples said. “It limited our ability to move the ball quickly and our speed, so we had to go to a small, tactical game.”
Despite these challenges, ten minutes into the second half, the Crimson extended its lead. This time, Bannon sent a through ball from the left wing into the circle for Keating. Keating gathered the pass and slipped a shot past Washburn for the first of her two scores on the day.
The Bears battled back. One minute after Harvard scored, Brown notched a goal on a deflection off a penalty corner. Then, with ten minutes left in regulation, a one-timer from Bears forward Abigail Taft tied the score and sent the game into overtime.
“Brown, to their credit, they were relentless,” Caples said. “They [scored] good goals. It’s a game of inches, and they just tucked them in.”
In overtime, the game suddenly ended when Keating converted on the counterattack. The game-winning goal, Keating’s second of the day, was her team-leading eighth score of the season.
“It was really exciting to pull in our first win in quite some time,” Keating said. “It was especially exciting winning in overtime. I think this will be a nice turnaround point in our season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—When the Harvard cross-country team hosted Yale in the squads’ annual dual meet Friday afternoon at Franklin Park, it looked like the Crimson had set out to do more than just win. It wanted to put on a clinic.
The men’s and women’s teams demonstrated different strategies for topping their respective opponents, with the men employing clever tactics to barely hold off the Bulldogs, while the women simply strong-armed the competition.
The 97th meeting of the squads featured nearly full strength Harvard teams for the first time this season, as junior co-captains Claire Richardson and Jamie Olson as well as fellow junior Dan Chenoweth made their debuts for the Crimson. While the women steamrolled Yale on the way to a nearly perfect victory—placing nine of the top 10 runners, including the first six, for a 15-49 victory—the men needed every last second, with Chenoweth coming up huge.
The junior standout won his first race of the season in impressive fashion, blazing through the 8k course in 24:20 to lead Harvard to a narrow 26-29 victory. The time marked a personal best at Franklin Park for Chenoweth, and a 24-second victory for the All-Ivy selection. Along with Richardson’s dominant first-place performance on the women’s side, Harvard coach Jason Saretsky was pleased with his juniors’ solid showing.
“Both Dan and Claire executed their race plans really well,” Saretsky said. “They got the work in that they needed and it was great to see them come away with a victory.”
Chenoweth, though, was a known factor entering the race, having paired with captain Chas Gillespie to finish one-two against the Bulldogs last season. The question for the Crimson men was who could fill out the rest of the lineup—and on alumni weekend, it was the squad’s youth that delivered.
Freshmen Sean Pohorence, Jeremy Gilmour, and Phil Galebach helped junior Ryan Neely rounded out Harvard’s top five, claiming third, fifth, and ninth overall. Neely crossed the line in 25:13 for eighth.
Pohorence had a particularly strong showing, finishing just one second behind Yale’s top runner, in 24:45.
“I was really happy with [my race],” Pohorence said. “I was a little nervous at the beginning because there were a ton of Yale guys around us...I just tried to stick in there and not worry about what I was doing so much, just hang with their guys.”
The rookie did more than hang on, eventually separating himself from the bulk of the field and overcoming his nerves.
“I’m used to the shorter distance races,” added Pohorence, who trailed early in his first collegiate meet as he adjusted to the shift from the high school 5k. “But [today] we had enough time to get back.”
While Pohorence said he was not concerned with elaborate strategy in the dual meet, the rest of the squad used a solid game plan to overcome a Bulldog squad that topped the Crimson just two weeks ago.
“We had tactics to stick with Yale’s third guy,” Gilmour explained, “and then we felt pretty good so Sean, Ryan, and I stuck together and settled on Yale’s top two guys.”
The pack-running paid off for Harvard, as the Crimson managed to split the Bulldogs’ top performers. Although Gilmour and Neely fell of the pace a bit on the final hill, they and Galebach held on long enough to earn retribution for the team’s September defeat.
“I think we did really well, especially after the race a couple of weeks ago where it seemed like we could have done better,” Gilmour said. “The pressure was on this time, but I think everyone went out there and performed.”
The women’s side featured much less drama, but yielded the same satisfaction for the home team and its bus full of spectators.
Coming off of a victory at the Iona Meet of Champions, Harvard looked even stronger with its top runners in the field. Richardson and sophomores Kailyn Kuzmuk and Nicole Cochran took an early lead as a pack and cruised to a finish in the top three spots, with Richardson’s 17:42.34 leading the way. As sophomore Jeanne Mack, Olson, and junior Eliza Ives crossed the line to round out the first six scorers, it became clear how dominant a full-strength Crimson team can be.
“It was great to pick up from last year and get back into it,” said Olson of her first race. “I think we made a pretty big statement about how we hope to perform later on.”
The Harvard women entered the meet as heavy favorites and thus felt less urgency than their male counterparts, but Olson noted that the squad is always fired up for dual meets.
“[Head-to-head competition] makes a huge difference. It’s really personal, especially with Yale,” Olson said. “Instead of you and a mass of people, where the competitors are pretty anonymous, now it’s much more personal whether you win or lose.”
Perhaps this highly competitive atmosphere explains why Harvard continues to challenge the Bulldogs 102 years after the teams’ first contest. Although the schedule has been trimmed from seven Ivy dual meets to one, the Crimson has no plans to stop meeting its longstanding rival.
“We had a big alumni weekend around this race to celebrate the rich history of the rivalry,” Saretsky explained. “And it was great to hear stories about this rich history and all of the past dual meets.”
While the competition has featured back and forth results for the squads in the past, the Crimson has now claimed victory for three straight years. And it appears that Harvard still has a lesson or two to teach its old foe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Learning hurts. That’s what the Harvard men’s water polo team found out this weekend when it traveled to California to play some of the best teams in the country at the Claremont Convergence Tournament. Taking on Chapman and Pomona-Pitzer on Friday and nationally-ranked Concordia and Cal Baptist on Saturday, the Crimson dropped all four contests.
“California is the epicenter, the pinnacle of collegiate water polo,” said sophomore utility man Mike Katzer. “What we want to do is play tough competition. If we win, that’s great, but mainly [we want] to improve.”
There were certainly many teaching moments this weekend.
The Crimson (4-12, 2-0 CWPA North), which had been playing well going into the weekend, hope they have learned enough going into the meat of conference play, where the team is currently undefeated and tied for first place.
“We make this trip to gear up for the league games and that will determine our season,” Katzer said. “We have three games coming up, they’re huge games, and that’s what really matters.”
NO. 20 CAL BAPTIST 14, HARVARD 5
The Crimson was the last thing standing between Cal Baptist (14-2) and a sweep of the Claremont Convergence schools. But after bowling over the rest of the teams they played this weekend, the Lancers’ game against Harvard was more of a victory lap than anything else.  Eight different Cal Baptist players scored while Katzer’s hat trick accounted for the majority of the scoring on the Crimson’s side. The Lancers were all over the Crimson, forcing twelve turnovers, something they had done against teams throughout the weekend.
“Let’s just say we didn’t play our best,” co-captain Egan Atkinson said, “but I think we definitely got some kinks out and we’ll be better in upcoming games.”
Senior goalie Nikhil Balarman made 11 saves in the loss.
NO. 14 CONCORDIA 11, HARVARD 6
Harvard’s game against Concordia had more bright spots than the Cal Baptist game, but the result was still the same. The Crimson rallied from an 8-2 halftime deficit to bring the score within two goals.
“If we set our minds to it we can really play against any team in the nation,” junior Jeff Lee said.
But Harvard was unable to close the gap any further, and the Eagles (17-2) scored three more for an 11-6 win.
Harvard has been rotating goalies, and this time it was sophomore Alexandre Popp who recorded the saves, with eight for the outing.
“I think our goalies both showed some great moments and [demonstrated] maturity and they both are showing great progress,” junior co-captain Bret Voith said. “Their play gives the rest of the team confidence.”
POMONA PITZER 11, HARVARD 8
Another late rally came up short against the Sage Hens (8-10). Perhaps still tired from its earlier game against Chapman, the Crimson struggled to get things going for the first three quarters of the contest and trailed by six entering the fourth quarter, where they rallied.
“It was a really hostile environment,” Lee said. “It was crazy. We were able to fight back in that environment.”
Atkinson had three goals for the game, while several other players contributed, such as junior Alex Thompson and freshman Antone Martinho, who had his first collegiate goal.
But a strong fourth quarter could not redeem a sluggish start, as the Crimson dropped its second contest of the day.
“We lost a couple games that we definitely could’ve won,” Atkinson said. “The team is a lot better and we know what we need to fix heading into our conference play.”
CHAPMAN 9, HARVARD 4
In the Crimson’s first contest, Balaraman began his weekend with a strong performance, recording 11 saves against the Panthers (6-8). But Harvard could not generate enough offense to complement the defense’s play. Lee netted two goals, while Voith and senior Dan Furman each added a score, but the Crimson was unsatisfied with its efforts
“We had a couple uncharacteristically off games, especially on Friday,” Atkinson said, “But I think we’re going to be able to refocus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the sport of golf, home field advantage goes a long way.
Just ask the Yale men’s team, which walked away with first place at this weekend’s Macdonald Cup on its home turf, The Course at Yale—a course designed by co-founder of the USGA Charles Blair Macdonald in 1926.
When’re you’re playing on a course that ranks 71st on Golf Magazine’s list of the 100 most difficult courses in the world, any practice helps.
For the Bulldogs, routine practice on the challenging course is the norm.
But for the less habituated Harvard, it felt like, well, one of the most difficult courses in the world.
“It is a very difficult course, very tricky,” sophomore Mark Pollak said.
“It’s a course you need to play multiple times before you have a handle on it. The greens are very big, undulated, very difficult to read. There are a lot of blind shots.”
But for the Harvard golfers, the rainy weather actually helped to keep scores lower. The greens at The Course are traditionally firm, but the rain softened things out, making for an easier hold.
“Our scores would have won any other time at Yale,” sophomore Tony Grillo said.
“I think [Yale’s leader Tom McCarthy] shot a six under, which I think is probably a team record.”
The Crimson finished with a share of sixth—tied with Bryant University—amid the 15-team field. Harvard combined to shoot 864 over the three-round weekend.
Pollak was the Crimson’s first-round leader, shooting a 71 on the par-70 course.
Pollak slipped in the second round, shooting +4, before running three over in round three to finish the tournament at +8.
“We’re a little diasppointed,” Pollak said.
“We played well last week, and I felt like we didn’t have everything together this week.”
Grillo, who kept active this summer by competing in the USGA National Amateur Championships, finished second among Harvard golfers through the first round of play at +2. Grillo shot one under in Round 2 and another 72 in Round 3 to lead the Crimson scorers over the entire weekend.
“I had a good weekend,” Grillo said. “I was able to keep it together even when I didn’t feel like I was playing my best. I was able to grind it out.”
Tying Pollak, senior Greg Shuman shot 76, 69, and 73 over the weekend to also finish at eight over par.
Rounding out Harvard’s scorers, captain Danny Mayer had a tough first round, shooting a 77, but improved in each subsequent round going +3 in Round 2 before shooting par in the final round to finish at +10.
Rookie Max Campion, who notched a +13 in last weekend’s McLaughlin tournament in Bethpage, was the team’s fifth man, completing the tournament in 227 shots for +17.
Yale won the tournament with a combined score of 842.
The Bulldogs were recovering from last week’s play where it lost narrowly to Dartmouth, which finished ninth this past weekend.
“They’re an extremely good team,” Pollak said of Yale. “Playing that course on a day-to-day basis helps them a lot. They may be little half-stroke advantages, but in the end, it adds up to a significant difference.”
Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth were the only Ivy schools competing this weekend, just two weeks shy of the Ivy Match Play.
The Crimson saw Dartmouth last weekend, edging the Big Green by seven strokes.
Heading into the back half of the fall season, Harvard remains confident about its standing among the stiff competition in the rest of the Ivy league.
But before it can begin thinking about the Ivy play at Bay Club, the Crimson first needs to get past the Big 5 Invitational at the Philadelphia Cricket Club, where it will likely see Yale again, as well as Princeton
“We went into this tournament looking to win,” Grillo said. “We have a really solid lineup. As much as this [weekend] is a small step backwards for us, it definitely doesn’t set us back as far as the season goes.”
“One tournament doesn’t always tell you everything,” Pollak added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone deserves a second chance, and the Harvard women’s volleyball got one. But the Crimson (4-9, 0-2 Ivy) couldn’t take advantage of its second consecutive meeting with Dartmouth, falling to the Big Green (6-6, 2-0) on Friday.
Harvard fell 14-25, 22-25, 19-25 in a shutout against Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H., after the Big Green had defeated the Crimson at a home match on Sept. 25. The two-match series provided the teams with an opportunity to rework their play to best suit their opponents, Harvard arrived in Hanover with a different game plan than it had in the teams’ initial meeting.
“We played a much better match this Friday than we had last week,” co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn said. “Back-to-back is a fun opportunity. We changed some things up to adjust to the Dartmouth offense because they’re a really quick team with a good setter.”
The defense was one of the few bright spots this weekend for the Crimson, which out-blocked the Big Green, 6.5-6.0. Harvard also had a nine-dig advantage in the match, partly in thanks to sophomore Christine Wu’s team-high of 19.
But the Crimson struggled offensively, generating a .067 attack clip relative to Dartmouth’s .222. Junior Mikaelle Comrie, who managed eight kills, led the women’s squad with help from sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll, who recorded seven. Harvard also had six more team members contribute at least two kills over the three-set match.
“Defense would get the ball up and hitters didn’t do such a great job at putting it away or even keeping it in the court,” Ingersoll said.
The Big Green’s Megan MacGregor did not encounter such troubles on the attack, notching 16 kills on 29 attempts for a .517 attack percentage.
The Crimson was quickly put on its toes Friday when Dartmouth setter Kendall Houston opened the first set with two aces—the home team put up six throughout the night. But Harvard refused to let its opponent build an early advantage and the two teams rallied back-and-forth until the Big Green jumped ahead at 14-9 and forced the Crimson to take its first timeout. It was not enough to get the team on track, and Dartmouth scored 10 consecutive points before closing out the game and establishing a 1-0 lead.
The second set looked much more promising, as Harvard leapt out to a 5-1 lead with Wu serving and sophomore Sandra Lynn Fryhofer contributing two kills in a row. The Big Green responded with four consecutive serving points from Amber Bryant, but the Crimson took a two-point lead at 9-7 before Dartmouth called for a timeout. After the break, the Big Green came back and built up a 21-15 lead off of several Crimson serving errors. Senior setter Lily Durwood served until Harvard was within one point of tying, but Dartmouth ultimately finished with a 25-22 advantage.
Despite playing from a 2-0 hole, the Crimson successfully kept pace with Dartmouth to start the third frame. The two teams tied a total of eight times throughout the final set. There was no more than a two-point difference in the score until past the halfway point, when the Big Green went up 15-12. Once again, the Crimson used a timeout to try and compose itself, but Dartmouth would not relent. A combination of serving from Houston and a powerful kill by Morgan Covington gave the Big Green the set, and the match.
“I hope we all come into practice this week with everyone willing to take on responsibility to better themselves,” Ingersoll said. “And what we really need is consistency.”
Harvard’s Ivy League record is now 0-2, and the team has a long stretch of conference games ahead. Ono Horn echoed Ingersoll’s sentiments, saying that the team will continue to improve as it tries to rack up some wins in the upcoming weeks.
“Consistency is what we’re going to try to build up,” Ono Horn said. “We’re a really powerful and athletic team, but we need consistency so that when things get chaotic we can go back to basics.”
The Crimson will attempt start anew in Ivy play next weekend in a New York road trip featuring battles with Cornell and Columbia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team continued its strong preseason showing at the Air Force Invitational in Colorado Springs, Colo. this weekend. Each of the Crimson competitors made it to the semifinal rounds, with five players continuing on to the finals and two leaving as champions.
Harvard turned in its dominant performance in spite of the unique atmosphere that Colorado brings.
“I was really impressed to see our players adapt to the conditions in Colorado,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “We were at a higher altitude where the ball was different, as were the overall conditions.”
“We didn’t really have any expectations going into [the tournament],” junior captain Samantha Rosekrans continued. “We were playing at a different altitude and in colder weather, so it was difficult to be prepared.”
But preparation did not seem to be a problem, as the Crimson fought through numerous three-set matches and comebacks after early set losses.
Leading the Harvard squad were freshmen Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton. Tachibana, who has been a major contributor for the team already and is still undefeated this season, won the B draw after defeating Anya Villanueva of the University of New Mexico (4-6, 6-1, 6-1), Erin Monson of the University of Utah (6-4, 4-6, 6-2), and Abbie Probert of the University of Colorado at Boulder (6-0, 6-7, 7-5).
Kristin Norton took D draw by beating out Franzi Steinhardt of Illinois State University (7-5, 6-4), Michala Jensen of the University of Colorado at Boulder (5-1, ret.), and Pavlina Smatova of the University of Oregon (7-6, 6-3).
“Kristin [Norton] played exceptionally well this weekend.” Green said. “She and Hideko [Tachibana] play well when it counts.”
The two champions are evidence of the large role played by the youth of this Crimson team, which consists mostly of underclassmen. But the success of the team is dependent on the level of leadership.
“Our captain, Samantha [Rosekrans], who’s only a junior herself, has done a great job and is a great leader,” Green said. “She does so well at keeping [the players] fired up, hungry, and ready to play.”
“We’re a young team, but we have talent,” Rosekrans added. “I’m really excited for this year.”
Optimism is the theme for the upcoming spring season.
“This weekend was a good opportunity to get a boost of confidence early in the season,” junior Agnes Sibilski said. “Fall season doesn’t really matter, but it definitely translates over to the spring...This tournament may be preseason, but it still shows our opponents that we’re a feisty team.”
Sophomore Holly Cao, Rosekrans, and Sibilski made it to the finals in the A, C, and F draws, respectively.  Freshmen Sophie Chang and Louise Laciny advanced to the semifinals in the E and G draws.
Next up for the Harvard team is the USTA BJK National Tennis Center Invitational in Flushing, N.Y. this weekend.
“The Colorado tournament gave us more self-confidence going into this weekend’s invitational,” Rosekrans said. “It’s an Ivy match, so it will show us where we stand in conference and what we’re up against in the spring season.”
With performances such as the one in Colorado this weekend, and bolstered by young talent and strong leadership, this Crimson squad does seem to have a good season ahead of it.
“Stay tuned,” Rosekrans summed. “I think we’re a team to watch.”

Honey.
Butter.
HoneyButter?  Honeybutter? Honey-Butter?
Whatever it is, that stuff's amazing. And you know you love it.
No one in their right mind would disagree that at Harvard, Sunday is the best day of the week not because of God or church or anything like that but because of HUDS's "bread day" extravaganza in each dining hall for dinner. But while bread day has been given its due amount of praise, perhaps the most delicious part of the whole enterprise (a subtle little substance called Honey Butter--that's right, capitalize it!) often goes without mention.
And don't you dare tell FlyBy that the name "Honey Butter" doesn't ring a bell, as it's that gooey gloriousness that explodes all over your mouth and face as you take a bite of a warm slice of whole grain or sourdough bread as you start weekend homework on Sunday at 8pm.
And what exactly is in this delicious angel of taste, at least in a "scientific" sense? Find out more after the jump.
Well, for starters, Honey Butter is–in its .25 ounce serving size–only 26 "calories from fat," and, assuming you only eat 2,000 calories in a day (yeah right, you're in college), Honey Butter is only about one percent of your daily suggested intake! But who eats–or, rather, who has enough self-restraint merely to eat–just one tiny quarter of an ounce of this ambrosial accoutrement for some of the best warm (if not freshly baked) bread you can find at Harvard, even in the culinary Siberia that is Annenberg Hall?
And that brings FlyBy to disclose the best thing about Honey Butter: it has no trans fat whatsoever, and it's still butter, and it's still delicious. Heck, you might even be able to find it in New York City someday with a track record like that. According to the entry on the HUDS website on Honey Butter, this spiritually satisfying melange of "white clover honey" and "unsalted butter" (which, as anyone who watches the Barefoot Contessa or, God forbid, Paula Deen, knows, ain't the best for you) contains absolutely zero percent of the feared and banned artery clogger.
In fact, FlyBy is almost convinced that Honey Butter is even healthy, as one measly quarter ounce is two percent of your daily Vitamin A intake!
So who says that HUDS doesn't make any good food? How can those arguments even be made with the presence of something as charming as Honey Butter every Sunday night? The next time you're feeling down, just think of the next time your jowls will be dripping with the excess deliciousness of what just might be HUDS's most under-appreciated food item.
Aside, of course, from Ranger Cookies.

The posting proudly proclaims that of the 160,000 times the ad was viewed, it was clicked on by 163 people. In case we don't feel up to doing the math, HCL lets us know that this transfers to a click through rate of 0.10 percent. The library views the ad as a success, citing 0.04 percent as the click-through rate "that is typically considered successful in direct mail and online" and calling it "'a highly efficient and  cost-effective way of communicating with our students,'” in the words of Michael Hemment, Head of Research  and Learning Technology for HCL.
FlyBy looks forward to seeing what HCL puts in future Facebook ads. A coupon for free Lamont coffee after midnight, maybe? Now that's something that would be worth clicking.

Early this morning, Dr. Jack Szostak of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School learned that he and two colleagues had won the Nobel Prize in medicine for their work with telomerase, an enzyme that prevents chromosomes from, um, "fraying." Yeah. We'll leave our explanation at that.
Szostak's two colleagues were Elizabeth Blackburn of UC San Francisco and Carol W. Greider of Johns Hopkins. Apparently, the three had begun working together on the topic back in the 1980s, when none of us were even alive, much less pretentious enough to pretend that we actually know what telomerase is or what it does.
FlyBy is grateful that gifted minds such as Szostak's and his colleagues' still exist out there, although it would sure be nice if some of that brain power could diffuse (check out that science action!) for those of us who can't even finish our LifeSci 1a problem sets...
