After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Beyoncé has been busy running the world for the last few years, her little sis Solange has been awfully quiet since her 2008 album, "Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams." Living under the radar is the way she seems to like it, though; she'd rather make appearances on "Yo Gabba Gabba!" than at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, and, she'd rather cover Dirty Projectors than Etta James. For now, she's settled on a stripped-down, electronic sound that matches her public figure in its reservation. In contrast to the bombastic horns and heart-wrenching power anthems that appeared on Beyoncé's "4," Solange's latest EP, "True," features muted guitars and subdued electronic sounds. It's not loud or particularly dramatic. It just grooves and breathes, showcasing a fully independent star mature enough to forge her own path rather than simply revel in her sister's spotlight.
Perhaps the most outstanding part of "True" is its production, in which gorgeous keyboards with varying levels of reverb slip in between bass-heavy electronic drum kits and layers of Solange's oohs. The songwriting isn't particularly different than what she's done in the past; Solange could have written the simple, catchy R&B melody of "Some Things Never Seem to Fucking Work" three years ago, only she might have called it "Ode to the Vandellas," and it would have been driven by a '70s-style horn section and a tambourine.
Here, though, the electronic hi-hat shimmies along, while the Rhodes provides a fragile backing for morose lyrics like, "I'm thinking of some time off / I'm dreaming of a time that you knew me." Indie producer Dev Hynes even throws in an eerie spoken word verse at the end to fit the vibe.
Throughout the tight seven-track EP, Solange shows full her commitment to her lo-fi, decidedly un-Beyoncé-esque sound. The fluttering piano riff on "Locked in Closets" comes straight from the James Blake playbook. The drum breakdown on "Lovers in the Parking Lot" is more EDM than anything else. And on "Don't Let Me Down," the whining, wah-ing horn synthesizers sound like they're making a mockery of classic soul arrangements rather than paying homage.
So while Beyoncé has belted her way to the center, Solange has drifted to the edges. She joins a steadily growing R&B fringe—Jessie Ware, How to Dress Well, The Weeknd—that revels in synthetic sounds and opaque emotions. It's not music for the center of the party, but rather for the lonely wallflower or the unrequited lover. This group of loners may not give rise to a totally cohesive movement—they are loners, after all—but they provide an intriguing and sonically intense deviation to a genre that frequently seems to be spinning its wheels in place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 22, 2013, at 1:01 a.m.
Harvard has delivered verdicts to all of the approximately 125 students ensnared in the Government 1310 cheating scandal and plans to make an announcement about the results of the investigation near the start of the spring semester, according to a Harvard spokesperson.
 
Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement that the Administrative Board finished evaluating the set of cases in December. 
 
Though Neal did not provide a specific date for the planned announcement, he wrote that it would come “near the beginning of the new semester, after students and faculty have returned to campus.” He also did not say how much new information would be released, but the Ad Board’s website states that the Board is bound to confidentiality about case specifics even after an investigation has concluded. 
 
The completion of the investigation marks a turning point for the scandal that Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris called “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory” when it was first announced at the end of August. Over the past semester, the Ad Board investigated approximately half of the undergraduates enrolled in last spring’s offering of Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” for plagiarism and inappropriate collaboration on a take-home final exam. Administrators said that each case would be resolved on an individual basis.
 
Harvard did not put forward a deadline for the completion of the investigation, yet one student said in an interview with The Crimson that he was told that his case would be resolved by November at the latest. Ultimately, some cases were not resolved until near the end of the fall semester.
 
“The cases were exceptionally complex and involved far more students than any other set of cases in recent memory, requiring great amounts of time and effort from the staff and faculty involved,” Neal wrote in his statement on Friday. 
 
To handle the increased workload, Harvard hired “fact finders” to assist with the investigation, and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds canceled a graduate seminar she had been slated to teach in the fall of 2012 in part due to the demands of the case.
 
Now that all verdicts have been issued, Harvard could potentially face lawsuits from aggrieved students who may claim that the Ad Board did not follow the procedures listed in the student handbook while evaluating each case.

Walter Peppelman earned his 100th career win in the wrestling match against Rutgers, helping the co-captain garner the week’s top honors. But some other Crimson athletes put up fine weekend performances as well, earning Athlete of the Week Runner Up nods from The Back Page.
 
Jillian Dempsey, Women’s Hockey
The senior forward has been absolutely dominant this season in the Crimson’s front line. This week’s performances were no different. Dempsey netted a pair of goals in Harvard’s 5-1 routing of Connecticut earlier this week. Over the weekend, Dempsey scored the game winning goal off a power play in Harvard’s 1-0 victory over Union. For the season, Dempsey has a team-high 21 goals and 16 assists for 37 points, 10 more than any other player on the Crimson’s roster. The senior is the ECAC’s leading scorer, averaging 1.167 goals per game.
 
Steve Moundou-Missi, Men’s Basketball
 
The sophomore played a key role in keeping Harvard close in its weekend contest at Memphis. The forward put up 10 points and seven rebounds off the bench in 27 minutes of playing time. Moundou-Missi’s dunk with less than eight minutes to go gave Harvard its first lead of the game and the sophomore added two more key free throws a minute later to tie the contest, but the Crimson would eventually fell, 60-50.
 
DJ White, Men’s Volleyball
The sophomore outside hitter helped get Harvard’s season off to a hot start. The Crimson won a pair of opening weekend matchups against Stevens and NYU. White recorded 19 kills in Harvard’s 3-0 victory over the Ducks, while also adding three digs and two block assists. The following evening, the sophomore put up nine kills, seven digs, and four blocks in Crimson’s 3-0 win over the Violets.

Let the countdown to the Harbowl begin. Wins by the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens Sunday set up the first all-brother Super Bowl coaching matchup. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh will face younger brother Jim Feb. 3 in New Orleans.
The matchup prompted The Back Page to look for Harvard games that involved similar sibling rivalries. We found the McLaughlins.Frank McLaughlin coached the Harvard men's basketball team from 1977 to 1985, compiling a 99-110 record over eight seasons.  McLaughlin may be best remembered for his 1983-84 squad, which set the NCAA single-season free throw record (82.2 percent) that still stands today.
But McLaughlin's tenure is also unusual because of two early-season, non-conference games. Why? Because McLaughlin's younger brother Tom coached UMass. From 1981 to 1983, Tom McLaughlin led the Minutemen, who went 16-40 during his two seasons at the bench.
This December 1981 article previewed Frank and Tom's first match-up. The two brothers downplayed any rivalry, but former Notre Dame coach and current ESPN analyst Digger Phelps, under whom both McLaughlins had coached as assistants, thought differently:
"They're lying," Phelps said. "They want to beat each others' brains out. They're just being nice to each other, and they'll be nice to each other until the jump ball."
UMass edged Harvard, 75-73, at the MAC in 1981. Frank coached through a ruptured disc in his back as the Crimson dropped its fourth straight.
But Frank would have the last laugh on December 4, 1982. Trailing 38-25 with 11:07 left in regulation, Harvard staged what writer Mike Knobler described as "one of the biggest turnarounds in Crimson history."
Harvard point guard Calvin Dixon led his team on a 18-2 run as the visiting Crimson emerged victorious in an absolute barn-burner, 45-44.
"He's about 10 years older than me now," Frank joked after the game about his brother, who is four years his junior.
By the second half of the decade, unfortunately, both Frank and Tom had drifted away from coaching, precluding any more McLaughlin thrillers. Frank served as Fordham's athletic director for 27 years before taking an emeritus role in May 2012. Tom is the founder and CEO of Best In Sports, Inc., a sports marketing and representation firm.
If the game in New Orleans is as close as either of the McLaughlin Bowls, football fans are in for a treat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in 13 days, Jeremy Lin ’10’s Houston Rockets could slap hands and smile as the final buzzer rang. After seven consecutive losses, Houston came from behind in Monday’s game at the Charlotte Bobcats, taking the lead in the fourth quarter and winning shortly after, 100-94.
The effort was largely led by Rockets James Harden and Marcus Morris, who tallied a combined 50 points, 15 rebounds, and nine assists. Lin, for his part, contributed four points on one-of-five shooting, collecting three rebounds and two assists in 24 minutes of playing time—an amount nine minutes under his season average.
The oddity in his minutes came largely from the fact that Lin did not play one second in the fourth quarter—Houston head coach Kevin McHale elected to go with rookie point guard Patrick Beverly instead. When asked about the basis of this decision, McHale did not give much insight.
“We were just sticking with what worked,” McHale explained. “[Beverly has] got to get with what we’re doing a little bit. He hasn’t been here very long. Practice tomorrow is going to be big for him. He’ll get some more sets down and get some stuff we’re doing. Hopefully we can start building on this.”
While the emergence of Beverly may not be beneficial for Lin’s time on the floor, it was certainly positive for the Rockets on Monday afternoon. With the squad’s win and the Minnesota Timberwolves’ loss, Houston gains a full game in the standings on the T-Wolves, launching it back into the final playoff seed for the time being.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brian Rogers' job search is officially over.
The former Harvard men's soccer forward, who graduated a semester early in the fall in anticipation of going pro, will be playing professional soccer after he was drafted in the second round as the 29th overall pick of the MLS Supplemental Draft on Tuesday by the Vancouver Whitecaps FC.
“I’m just really excited that Vancouver has decided to give me an opportunity to continue playing for at least the time being,” Rogers said.
Rogers’ climb to the MLS will be an uphill one. Of the four Ivy League players selected in the Supplemental Draft last season, three were cut within a year. If he makes the team, the forward will join Andre Akpan ’10 (Colorado Rapids) and Mike Fucito ’09 (San Jose Earthquakes) in the league.
“I wasn’t really expecting [to be drafted],” he said. “I hadn’t really thought about it because of my not having played that much over the last few years, so I had been making other plans to play overseas. [But] this is a great opportunity.”
His former coach, Carl Junot, said he had talked to the Whitecaps’ coaching staff about Rogers’ potential.
“I think he’s a player that can play at that level,” Junot said. “In the [MLS] Brian is a target forward.... His ability to fit in with what they are doing still needs to be proven, but athletically, he’s there.”
Rogers is hoping he will be able to establish himself in the league after an up-and-down career at Harvard that began with a standout rookie campaign but was littered with injury and team struggles from then on.
As a freshman in 2009, the forward won Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors after ranking second on the Crimson with 18 points and six goals. Those numbers established him as a legitimate number two option alongside Akpan, and together the pair helped lead Harvard to the Sweet 16 and a Top 10 ranking.
“Andre kind of took me under my wing my freshman year, and I’ve kept in good touch with him even after he graduated,” Rogers said. “He sent a ‘congratulations’ to me so I’m sure I’ll speak with him later today or tomorrow to get some advice about what to expect as I go into preseason games.”
Rogers’ sophomore season began on a similar high when he scored the game-winning goal in the 80th minute to lead the No. 10 Crimson to a win over No. 13 Stanford in front of a sold-out home crowd in Harvard’s season opener. The forward displayed a flair for the dramatic again later in the month when he scored a game-tying goal in the 90th minute against Stony Brook, and he finished with five scores on the season.
But the final two years of Rogers’ career were dominated by injury, as he played in just 19 total games and scored only three goals. With Rogers as the number one option, his team failed to replicate the success it had when he was playing off of Akpan and went just 5-23-6 over the last two seasons.
“He only got stronger,” Junot said. “He learned to play within a different system, learned to play against better players, learned to manage injuries, which is really important for any career. Players get injuries; it’s how they manage them that determines how their career will go.”
Despite those struggles, the Whitecaps clearly saw something they liked in the senior, who becomes the first Harvard player ever to be selected in the Supplemental Draft and the first since Akpan and Kwaku Nyamekye ’10 three years ago to be drafted by the MLS at all.
“I just got a call from one of the assistant coaches to congratulate me and tell me they’re excited for me to come in,” Rogers said. “Nothing’s guaranteed. I’ll still be competing for a roster spot.”
Princeton’s Mark Linnville was also selected in the Supplemental Draft—as the 24th overall pick by the Philadelphia Union—while Brown’s Dylan Remick was taken in the second round of the SuperDraft last week by the Sounders.
The Whitecaps open training camp next week in Burnaby, British Columbia, and play their first preseason match against Seattle on February 6.
“His work has really only just begun,” Junot said. “I always think getting drafted means very little. It’s about what you do in camp.”
