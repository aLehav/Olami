After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The human instinct to remain alive despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles is the central theme of “Slumdog Millionaire” director Danny Boyle’s new film “127 Hours.” The movie follows the true story of Aron Ralston (James Franco), an adventurous yet somewhat eccentric extreme sports enthusiast, who explores the mountains of Canyonlands National Park, Utah. Based on Ralston’s autobiography “Between a Rock and a Hard Place,” the film recreates the adventurer’s traumatic five-day ordeal when he finds himself trapped by a boulder that has pinned his right arm.
As Ralston struggles to survive with just one arm, a video camera to keep him company, and a small backpack of limited supplies, the truly dire nature of his predicament quickly becomes apparent. Ralston’s water supply diminishes and his food rations are soon depleted. What then unfolds is the compelling story of a man who remembers why he wants to live, and how much he has to lose if he takes his last breath in those perilous mountains.
The film gives over almost all of its screen time to Franco, bringing the inner life of the character to the forefront of the film. Franco’s only interaction with others—prior to the film’s closing moments—is at the outset of the story, when he encounters a pair of female travelers. But despite being cut off from human contact for most of the film, Franco manages to  convey Ralston’s eccentricity convincingly in the face of imminent death by expressing a mixture of panic, fear, and humorous attempts to remain sane.
Talking to his handy-cam as if he were a TV host, Franco makes fun of his situation and laughs at his own stupidity in not telling his friends he was going out to the mountains. This element of self-reflection adds a much needed dimension to Boyle’s one-man show; it enables “127 Hours” to avoid becoming about James Franco making meaningful faces at the audience for an hour or so while his life flashes before his eyes. Given this creative latitude, the actor delivers a superb performance.
The visual elements of Ralston’s reflections, memories, and near-death experience, beautifully crafted by Boyle, bring the fullness of life and love to this ostensibly gritty, claustrophobic story. One striking scene comes as Ralston’s need for water reaches the breaking point and, in a dream sequence, he imagines the heavens opening and water dripping into the crack in which he is stuck. The intensity of his situation is emphasized as the rain continues to gush through, almost drowning Ralston in the downpour. Suddenly, Ralston is seen running through the rain to reach the house of his ex-girlfriend. The possibility of rekindling the flame of a lost love overrides the desire for water.
In this psychedelic manner, Ralston’s personal and inner life is given prominence while the physical necessities of human life confronting him are sidelined. However, while these visions—drawn from Ralston’s actual account—provide fascinating insight into a man who is about to lose everything, the scenes tend to detract from the portrayal of the anguish of a truly desperate man.
But at the price of this element of realism, Boyle is able to present a powerful portrait of mental liberation during physical entrapment. In Boyle’s and Franco’s capable hands, a story of despair becomes one about the ideas and emotions which fuel the human determination to live on.

In Mikael Håfström’s “The Rite,” a troubled young seminarian named Michael Kovak (Colin O’Donoghue) travels to Italy and turns to the practice of exorcism under the tutelage of the renegade Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins). The film is based on the book “The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist” by journalist Matt Baglio, who shadowed an American Catholic priest in Rome as he took a course at a Vatican-affiliated university in order to become an exorcist. The book, and by extension the film, was intended to challenge the negative stereotypes about exorcism created and perpetuated by contemporary culture and cinema. Ironically, because the film constantly falls back upon horror clichés—enlivened but emphasized by genre master Anthony Hopkins’s participation—it accomplishes the exact opposite, reinforcing the very perceptions the film was intended to combat.
Like many overwrought horror movies, “The Rite” relies on redundant visual cues to signal the psychological mood. There are only two lighting schemes: dark and darker. Even Rome, one of the most colorful cities of the world, becomes overcast and stormy shortly after Michael’s arrival. That alone would be more than enough to suggest that the path of the exorcist is a dark one. Yet the film still feels the need to pummel the viewer with stock material to make the same point. There are crucifixes everywhere, sometimes more than one on a single wall, and if there are no crucifixes to be had, then a statuette of a saint can invariably be found gazing down reprovingly at all the human goings-on.
When O’Donoghue’s Michael arrives at this gloomy caricature of Rome, his mentor is Father Lucas Trevant, an entertaining character insofar as we all know that Anthony Hopkins is never up to any good. Bustling around Rome in long black robes, Father Lucas makes house calls to the possessed and speaks in accented Italian—all the while scarcely able to contain the crazy dancing behind his eyes. He is a predator marking out the weak hidden in the dark recesses of society. Hopkins’s portrayal of Father Lucas is as lighthearted and convivial as one can reasonably expect for an unsettling exorcist, and with this welcome levity he briefly dominates the film. But, predictably, he soon descends into sociopathy and becomes as absurd as the film’s premise and landscape.
The movie opens with a quote from John Paul II: “The battle against the Devil, which is the principal task of Saint Michael the Archangel, is still being fought today, because the Devil is still alive and active in the world.” Given such a formidable foe, one would expect the people possessed by demons in the film to be effective agents of evil and corruption, but those possessed in “The Rite” are more remarkable for their weaknesses. The audience does not fear a character like Rosaria (Marta Gastini), a pregnant 16-year-old recently raped by her father and now possessed by the devil; instead, it pities her. The ability of the possessed to fight back against those trying to purge them of their possession is what gives other similar films, like “The Exorcist,” the dramatic tension completely lacking in “The Rite.”
Ultimately, “The Rite” is undone by its contradictory impulses. It aims to be a horror film, with all the absurdity that the genre entails—from scenes of Rosaria and Father Lucas choking up nails, to one of Michael finding a pool of demonic frogs in Father Lucas’s quaint Roman courtyard. But the film also hopes to frighten its viewers in a more realistic sense by insinuating that the Devil could possess anyone and that his horrors could be part of our reality. When all is said and done, the campy absurdity of the former impulse undoes any hope of achieving the latter. “The Rite” comes across as highly implausible, continuing the cinematic tradition of making exorcism appear preposterous. With it, Baglio’s book “The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist” has ironically come full circle.

The Coen brothers’ “True Grit,” released on Christmas Day 2010, is a remake of a 1969 movie, itself an adaptation of a 1968 novel. The central plot has persisted: 14-year-old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) enlists the services of U.S. Marshal Reuben J. “Rooster” Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to hunt down Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who killed her father. It is by no means the brothers’ finest film, but is nevertheless a welcome and refreshing addition to their corpus.
Among its many virtues, the movie is superbly cast. Bridges is a perfect choice for the one-eyed, whiskey-swilling Cogburn, a role first played by John Wayne in a Best Actor-winning performance—far from an easy act to follow. It’s hard to believe now that Bridges originally achieved renown as a handsome leading man in the likes of “The Last Picture Show” and “The Fabulous Baker Boys.” He has since discovered a wonderful second career as a hairy, sloppy old guy, from the Coens’ “The Big Lebowski” to last year’s Oscar-winning turn in “Crazy Heart.” He has gracefully aged ungracefully: the anti-Nicolas Cage.
For his own role in “True Grit,” Matt Damon, formerly of the class of ’92, apparently took a lesson in humility and ingenuity from his co-star. Playing brilliantly off-type, he adopts a second chin and a handlebar mustache to become the cartoonish LaBoeuf, a Texas Ranger who assists and annoys Cogburn as he endeavors to track down Chaney.
But these men are beside the point. At its heart, “True Grit” is a Bildungsroman about a child who is in many ways already an adult. As Mattie, the pragmatically vengeful daughter, Hailee Steinfeld is transcendent. Much of the pleasure of “True Grit” lies in watching her interact with her world. In one scene, her quietly ferocious negotiating tactics drive a local merchant to distraction; in another, she calmly agrees to spend a night in a coffin among the corpses of a funeral parlor, in the interest of frugality. This author, for one, would buy her future daughters a Mattie Ross American Girl doll.
In her competence and efficacy, Steinfeld’s Mattie brings to mind Marge Gunderson, the character that won Frances McDormand an Oscar in the Coen brothers’ “Fargo.” Despite their obvious vulnerability—Mattie’s youth and Marge’s pregnancy—both women operate on an entirely different level from those around them.
Don’t dismiss the buzz around Hailee Steinfeld as the sheer novelty of youth in a major role—“So many lines to memorize! So much school to miss!”—for hers is a truly nuanced and memorable performance. To cast Mattie Ross, the Coens held an international open casting call, and Steinfeld was chosen from a pool of 15,000.
Happily, Steinfeld has enjoyed the acclaim she deserves. Yet most of the awards and accolades she has garnered so far—including an Oscar nomination—are in the category of Supporting Actress, despite the fact that Mattie Ross seems an incontrovertibly leading role. This is because, as a general rule, child performers are restricted to the Supporting category, regardless of their screen time—with the notable exception of Keisha Castle-Hughes, who was nominated for Best Actress for “Whale Rider” at the age of fourteen. As Natalie Portman remains the Best Actress favorite for “Black Swan,” Steinfeld may very well benefit from her inclusion in a less competitive category.
But beyond its sterling performances, “True Grit” is particularly satisfying for one reason: although Joel and Ethan Coen have crafted a faithful Western, they refuse to rely on standard archetypes of the genre. The movie is populated not with larger-than-life cowboys, but strange, flawed, and contradictory characters. The leader of a posse of outlaws turns out to be protective of Mattie, while the primary antagonist, Tom Chaney, proves dumb to the point of absurdity. Mattie is never reduced to a damsel in distress, nor does she emerge from her quest unscathed. For all her strength, she is still a child: “I do not drink coffee,” she pointedly informs Ned Pepper (played by the appropriately surnamed Barry Pepper), “I am fourteen.”
In “True Grit,” we are offered a version of the West that is stylized yet fittingly gritty. Just as they do visual justice to the setting’s exquisite landscapes, the Coen brothers pay characteristic attention to regionally informed speech patterns. Mattie’s clipped, matter-of-fact formality is complemented by Rooster’s dusty drawl. When an attorney asks Cogburn how many men he has shot in the line of duty, the Marshal seeks morbid clarification: “Shot, or killed?” The movie is not a comedy, but—like much of the Coens’ work—is infused with dry, deadpan flair.
With “True Grit,” the Coen brothers have, not for the first time, produced a genre movie that defies its genre, filled with unconventional characters played by unlikely actors. It may not be their best work, but it is certainly some of the best work this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Surveying this year’s awards season, it seems only fitting that director Tom Hooper has generated so much talk with his film about a young British monarch’s speech impediment. After all, “The King’s Speech” seems to revolve almost entirely around words, expectations, and an important moment in the not-too-distant future. But while the creators of the film convey character, emotion, and urgency with their story, the film’s all-important words themselves ultimately communicate very little meaning.
“The King’s Speech” chronicles how Prince Albert of Britain (Colin Firth)—later King George VI—overcame a severe stutter through years of speech therapy with the unorthodox Dr. Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). At the same time, the film follows the winding political currents that brought Albert to the throne and Britain to war, and that inexorably lead to the titular “King’s Speech”—wherein the speech-challenged King George must rally his country to battle.
With every moment of his screen time, Firth adds layer after layer of complexity to the character of Prince “Bertie”. Whereas other actors might have given only lip service to the stuttering required for the role of George VI, Firth transforms every pause and partial utterance into a subtle but penetrating look into the mind of the frustrated royal he portrays.
Someone who can likely appreciate the unique pain and stigma of stuttering better than anyone is the film’s screenwriter, David Seidler, who overcame his own severe stutter as a child—an experience which clearly informs his script. But even apart from the skillfully crafted staccato dialogue, Seidler’s screenplay is remarkably clever, rife with metaphors, ambiguity, and Shakespearean allusions.
Director Hooper’s Britain reflects the grim uncertainty of the early 20th century. Typical British fog, rain, and snow press against the windows of dimly-lit offices and palace quarters while characters discuss their seemingly hopeless prospects. The musical backdrop, composed by Alexandre Desplat—who also scored this fall’s dark “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1”—complements the mood well with somber and often ominous melodies. The music thus mirrors the inner turmoil of both Europe and Prince Albert.
What saves “The King’s Speech” from its own melancholy, however, are the performances of Geoffrey Rush, as Firth’s speech therapist, and Helena Bonham Carter, as the monarch’s wife. Rush brings his delightful comedic style to the eccentric role of Dr. Lionel Logue, an unconventional physician who moonlights as an unsuccessful Shakespearan actor, while Bonham Carter delivers her bittersweet lines with both resolve and emotional tenderness. As Firth carries the heavy emotional load of the film, Rush and Bonham Carter are constantly on hand to lighten it. Together they enable the film to achieve a healthy balance between urgency and levity.
But setting aside its performances, what “The King’s Speech” lacks is any real substantive message. Perplexities such as the limits of family loyalty and royal responsibility to the state give Hooper’s cast something to talk about, but only so long as these issues pertain to Bertie’s situation as a stutter-burdened king. When the nervous but resolute George VI finally gives his much anticipated radio address to the nation, their smiles and gentle nods emphasize his accomplishment in actually forming words rather than the actual importance of the words themselves. The emotions involved are powerful, but the words involved seem almost beside the point. Indeed, the film’s most memorable utterances are undeniably its witty offhand conversations and wacky speech therapy sessions, and not its political theater. “The King’s Speech” is certainly full of talk, but the question remains—about what?

On Tuesday, Jan. 26, President Barack H. Obama stood before the nation and appealed to Harvard in his State of the Union address. “Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love,” he said, referencing the successful repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” the policy excluding openly gay individuals from military service. “With that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC. It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past. It is time to move forward as one nation.”
On Nov. 17, Harvard President Drew G. Faust made the case for ROTC’s return at the Institute of Politics, conditioned upon the repeal of DADT: “I want to be the president of Harvard who sees the end of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ because I want to be able to take the steps to ensure that any and every Harvard student is able to make the honorable and admirable choice to commit him or herself to the nation’s defense.” We agree with Presidents Obama and Faust, and urge the University to follow through on Faust’s pledge.
Just as DADT represented an outdated prejudice directed toward gay American citizens, the absence of ROTC now stands as a relic of an outdated bias against the American armed forces. When ROTC was expelled from Harvard in 1969, military enlistment was mandatory, as was ROTC participation on countless U.S. campuses. Today, absent its prior objectionable compulsory and discriminatory policies, ROTC deserves recognition as a legitimate pre-professional track at Harvard. The university supports pre-law, pre-med and pre-business activities on the part of its students; it should support pre-military study as well. Further, the same access to Harvard’s student body that is granted to recruiters for countless career paths should be given to the U.S. military.
We welcome the perspective of the military to Harvard’s marketplace of ideas, and believe that there can be no better context for an ROTC education than within Harvard’s curriculum and values. It is here that the complexities of moral philosophy, modern politics, and military instruction can be put into dialogue in the grand humanistic tradition of America’s greatest university. Students and teachers of all disciplines and political persuasions challenge and edify each other, and we are confident that the fruits of their considered conversations will redound to the benefit of our nation.
Of course, the extent of ROTC’s return to Harvard—beyond its recognition as an official campus organization—should be determined in consultation with the Pentagon and reflect the country’s needs. Admiral Michael G. “Mike” Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that “it is incredibly important to have ROTC units at institutions like this…and I certainly would do all in my power to make that happen.” We hope that Harvard will partner with our nation’s leaders in this regard.
We remind those who would oppose this move that President Faust and other Harvard administrators have repeatedly predicated the return of ROTC upon the repeal of DADT. Thus, should the university backtrack on its public commitment, its political credibility will be greatly impaired, as will Harvard’s ability to influence future legislation with similar pronouncements. On the other hand, by holding up its end of the bargain and bringing ROTC back to campus, the University lends strength and consequence to the repeal of DADT against those politicians who would reinstate it.
While we remain concerned about the continued exclusion of transgendered and intersex individuals from military service, we do not feel that this is sufficient justification for singling out the military for campus opprobrium. Furthermore, as such objections to ROTC only emerged in the public discourse after the repeal of DADT, to base rejection of ROTC on them now would be disingenuous and erode the credibility of Harvard as a good faith actor in this debate.
In making this argument for the return of ROTC to Harvard’s campus, we are cognizant of those undergraduates who currently participate in the program at MIT at great personal sacrifice. We commend them for following in the footsteps of prior Harvard servicemen, an illustrious group with the most Medal of Honor awardees of any institution of higher education outside the American service academies.
Pointing to this laudable legacy of service in Harvard’s past, President Faust made the case for ROTC’s return, telling a distinguished audience at the IOP, “It is my personal belief that Harvard has a responsibility to this nation and its citizens, a responsibility it has embraced since the earliest days of the Republic.” We concur. It is time for Harvard to set an example for America’s universities once more and renew this noble tradition.

As often happens in the northeast in the winter, on Dec. 26, it snowed.
There was nothing remarkable about the snow but its quantity, which led to plane cancelations and advisories. This snow also blocked roads and closed offices and, most problematically, stopped ambulances from getting to hospitals.
We’ve all heard much about the snow, about how New York City’s streets went unplowed. “We did not do as good a job as we wanted to do or as the city has a right to expect,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said later, somewhat testily, at a press conference.
On the day of the storm, my flight home was one of the many cancelled, so, adventurously, my family extended our rental car contract. “Yes,” said the woman from Dollar Car over the phone, “You can return the car in New York.”
We set out in our rented red Chrysler from North Carolina. We made it through Virginia and Maryland with little difficulty. The right windshield wiper broke halfway through the drive and we ran out of anti-freeze, which we bought more of in Delaware, where we also bought peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. But roads were clear, we maintained a respectable clip of nearly 60 mph, and maybe, we told ourselves, the decision to drive home had not been idiotic.
But then we hit New   Jersey. As soon as we crossed the state boundary, the black of the roads became white. Lane lines were covered by snow and the banks on the side of the road grew, pushing cars into a middle-of-the-road channel. The roads were a free-for-all. We, like those around us, preemptively turned on our hazard lights. Idiocy, we asked ourselves? Probably.
Four hours of slipping and distracting ourselves with the rental car’s Sirius radio later­—Rihanna and Justin Bieber are popular, matched possibly by Taylor Swift and Katy Perry but certainly no one else—we enter and subsequently exit the Lincoln Tunnel, only to face an entirely new challenge: Manhattan.
The car got stuck on 42nd street as we turned east. It got stuck again five more blocks north. Both of these times, though, we could rock the car out of the rut. A mile south of my apartment, however, we could not. In a pile of snow, beside an ice patch, behind a similarly stuck MTA bus  going nowhere, it was apparent that we weren’t going to be able to move, either.
In the aftermath of the storm, Bloomberg said of the city’s plowing efforts, “the question is why it did not work this time.” It’s true: there was miscommunication, and the system did not function as it should have.
But that it snowed was a decision made on high, far out of Bloomberg’s jurisdiction. And I wonder how fair it is to blame Bloomberg for the fact that the roads were snowy. The battalion of snowplows were under his purview, of course. The failures in the response system are his responsibility, as he said. But is the state of the roads a comment on Bloomberg? Only in part. That snowplow that I saw on 66th   street was out on the streets, ready to clear the roads, but circumstance prevented the plow’s progress—namely a bus blocking the road. Nothing Bloomberg could have done would have enabled that plow to move.
When my family’s car got stuck it was two in the morning, and we wanted nothing more than to be home. With the help of two cab drivers and a shovel, my sisters and I pushed the car into what was passable as a parking space, and, with scarves around our faces, we all walked the last mile home. On the way, we passed Bloomberg’s front door. The street beside was impassable, just like all the rest.

Many female service members deployed overseas stop drinking water after 7 p.m. to reduce the risk of being raped if they have to make a nighttime trip to the bathroom. A new class action lawsuit against the military contends that sexual assault occurs twice as frequently in the military as in civilian society. But the recent critique of the military has focused on the institutional discrimination in “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” (DADT), not on the ugly, equally pressing problem of sexual assault, and in President Drew G. Faust’s recent remarks connecting the end of DADT to the beginning of a Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) at Harvard, we see the same singling out of discriminatory policy as an obstacle to progress.  If Harvard is fighting the good fight, Faust’s high-profile announcement was a missed opportunity for broader comment on how we’d like our armed forces to change.
Some background: On December 18, 2010, President Faust released a statement announcing her intention to work with military officials to achieve “full and formal recognition of ROTC,” an announcement that was expected after the Senate’s long-awaited repeal of DADT. The link between a potential Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) at Harvard and the existence of DADT had become national news. In a September interview in The Boston Globe, Faust indicated that she would allow ROTC on campus once the Clinton-era law banning gay and lesbian service members from serving openly was repealed. The repeal of DADT marked the end of the military’s violation of Harvard's non-discrimination policy.The message to the military was clear: Your discriminatory policy is gone, so now you pass by our standards.
But did Faust’s sole focus on the non-discrimination policy as grounds for refusing—and now welcoming—the military ignore other serious problems in the military that we can’t label “institutional discrimination”?
In March 2010, the Pentagon released an annual report on sexual assault showing an 11 percent jump in reports of sexual assault in the military in 2009. At least part of this rise is likely attributable to better reporting services and a military more attune to victims’ fears of coming forward with their stories. There is no doubt that the military has become more accountable for sexual assault since 2004, when Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ordered a review process for how the military handled sexual assault. A year later, SAPRO, the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, became the permanent point of accountability and oversight for sexual assault policy, and it has been credited with better training for first-responders, enhanced methods of treatment, and more prosecutions of perpetrators. If 80 to 90 percent of sexual assaults go unreported, as SAPRO estimates, a rise in reported assaults may just mean that the victims, predominantly female, are now more comfortable coming forward. But there is reason to believe that this is not the full story.
Exactly one week before President Faust announced her satisfaction with the end of DADT, the ACLU, SWAN, the Service Women’s Action Network, and a handful of Yale Law students filed a lawsuit pressing the Pentagon to release its rape records. While it’s tough to root for Yale, it’s tougher to side with a military that won’t make public a vital set of data on this urgent problem.  The plaintiffs assert that the problem of sexual assault is far greater than the Pentagon or SAPRO is willing to admit. The military may be doing something to prevent sexual assault, but it is not doing enough. A recent Boston Globe editorial described the absence of guaranteed access to legal counsel for victims, suggesting that it could draw attention to the failure of the military to provide for its service members.  Even the touted prosecutions of perpetrators are dismally low—only eight percent of sex offenders are prosecuted in the military, compared to 32 percent in civilian society, according to SWAN. And of those prosecuted, a whopping 80 percent receive an honorable discharge. Apparently there is something commendable about raping your fellow soldier. There have been no activist superstars or superstar activists fighting this injustice, but salience is not always tantamount to significance.
Speaking of popularity, it was popular anti-war sentiment on campus that led the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to vote on February 4, 1969 to deny ROTC course credit. Generally remembered— albeit incorrectly—as Harvard’s abolition of ROTC on campus, it was a seminal moment in the University’s history of activism, prompting many universities around the country to take similar action. Thus, the recent controversy over ROTC did not begin as a DADT issue, it became one. President Faust, Justice Elena Kagan, and other Harvard administrators have used their influence admirably in making a stand against a discriminatory policy. But in her silence (or at least brevity), President Faust indicated a sense of finality in critique of the military. Regardless of whether or not it should stand in the way of ROTC’s reinstitution, military sexual assault is an urgent and noxious crisis that deserves far more attention from the media, the military, and the University than it has received—and Faust missed a striking opportunity to bring it up for discussion.

With Egyptian flags and posters of President Hosni Mubarak in hand, several hundred Boston-area residents showed up in Harvard Square Saturday afternoon to protest Mubarak’s 30-year regime and his violent response to the widespread uprisings in the Arab republic.
It was the first Boston-area protest since the unrest began in Egypt last Tuesday, inspired by the successful ousting of Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 11 days prior.
Egypt’s Mubarak has refused to step down as president, deploying soldiers and police with tear gas and rubber bullets to contain the crowds that have formed across Egypt.
Marihan Hashesh, a young interior designer from Somerville who organized the event, said she anticipated about 30 people to join her in Harvard Square. Instead, 500 people marked that they planned to attend the event she created on Facebook.
The event soon outgrew its setting, and Cambridge Police asked the demonstrators to relocate to Boston because the turnout was too large for Harvard Square. Escorted by several police cars, the protesters marched down Massachusetts Avenue and then down to the Boston Common, backing up traffic for several blocks.
Hashesh, who is of Egyptian descent and lived in Egypt for three years, said she organized the first protest in the Boston area to accommodate for those who could not travel to New York to join the demonstrations at the United Nations headquarters.
“Seeing what happened [in Egypt] broke my heart,” she said, explaining why she spearheaded the rally. The event drew protesters with young children, many of whom Hashesh said could not have attended a protest in another city.
Hasesh said that she chose Harvard Square because of an accommodating Cambridge police force and its long-standing tradition of hosting demonstrations. “Harvard Square is known for its protests,” she said, adding that the atmosphere in Cambridge represented a stark contrast to the events in Egypt.
“People here are smiling and happy because they have the right to protest,” she said. “In Egypt, they’re living it. Most of them know no other government.”
Hashesh’s use of Facebook to spread awareness of the event mirrored the use of social media to coordinate demonstrations throughout Egypt. But the day before the protest in Harvard Square, the Egyptian government took an unprecedented step by shutting down Internet access and cell phone services, restricting most communication with the outside world to landline phone calls.
Joshua Rubenstein, the Northeast Regional Director for Amnesty International, said the United States should center its stance around how the Egyptian government has infringed on human rights. “People have the right to communicate with each other,” he said, referring to the shutdown of Internet and cell phone services. “If they have an election, it should be an honest election.”
Sherry William, an Egyptian who graduated from Harvard Law School last year and attended the protest, said there was a sense of embarrassment that Tunisia, a country with one-tenth the population of Egypt, was the epicenter of the demonstrations that have spread across the Arab world. “It’s pretty surprising that such a small revolution inspired Egypt to act,” she said, dressed in red, white, and black to represent the Egyptian flag. “Traditionally, Egypt is the heart of the Arab world.”
Mina E. Khalil, an Egyptian JD candidate at Harvard Law School who was in Egypt until two Sundays ago, said he hoped the United States would take a stronger stance on a regime change and spent much of the rally leading the crowd in shouting “Hey Obama, you should know—Hosni Mubarak has got to go.”
Khalil, a Christian, stressed that the uprisings are pan-Egyptian, regardless of religion or age.
One woman also held up a sign that read, “Muslim, Christian, we’re all Egyptian.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lila E. Nieves-Lee ’13 had a vision for a new type of final club—a group that would be part social club and part philanthropic organization. But after spending a month and a half recruiting members, designing the club’s crest, and planning its first charity event, Nieves-Lee has decided that the Rose Society Philanthropic Club will not become Harvard’s sixth all-female final club this year.
Nieves-Lee said she hoped to create the club to help improve Harvard’s much-maligned social scene.
But this past week, leaders of the never-quite-formed Rose Society decided to halt the development of the final club.
“We had a meeting, we all discussed it, and it just wasn’t the right time,” Nieves-Lee said.
According to Nieves-Lee, the time commitment necessary to establish a club became too demanding for those involved. The combination of sophomore tutorials, job applications, and thesis work that comes with second semester meant that the women involved did not have enough time to focus on the club.
“It was really close to all of us. It was an idea that we all really wanted,” Nieves-Lee said. “[When you] realize that you can’t really do something or you can’t give it your all, more often than not you’d rather drop it than fail at it.”
Nieves-Lee came up with the idea for the club during last fall’s reading period. She recruited the help of two of her blockmates and later found seven other girls who shared her vision, she said.
The club’s founders had hoped that its charity work would have gone towards combating domestic violence. Nieves-Lee said her grandmother was a victim of domestic violence, and the issue was very relevant to women in the Boston area.
Before disbanding last week, the organizers had already created a website and official crest and begun searching for possible charities among women’s shelters in the Boston area. They also commissioned shirts with the club’s crest embroidered on the chest. Although the club no longer exists, Nieves-Lee said that the founders will “still be rocking our shirts.”
The monetary costs of starting a final club were not a contributing factor to the dissolution of the organization, said Nieves-Lee.
“The information that we learned and the experience that we got from just trying is worth far more than having never done it at all,” she said.
Tara D. Venkatraman ’11, who is part of an unnamed anti-final club campaign, said that she saw the attempt to create a new final club as a sign that people are searching for more social options.
“A lot of people on this campus think there’s kind of a crisis with social life at Harvard,” Venkatraman said. “And a lot of people on this campus are trying to think about different ways to address that.”

Emily G. Rosenthal, sophomore advising coordinator at Pforzheimer House, will be the new Currier resident dean, House Masters James L. Cavallaro and Nadejda Marques announced in an e-mail sent yesterday to Currier residents.
Interim Resident Dean and Tutor of Currier House, Allison D. Diop-Frimpong, announced her resignation from both roles in an e-mail to Currier House residents last Thursday.
“I have decided to step away from my role as Interim Resident Dean and Tutor of Currier House to take more time to be with my family,” she wrote in the e-mail, explaining her departure.
Diop-Frimpong and her husband, Benjamin, have a 10-month-old son.
Diop-Frimpong became Interim Allston Burr Resident Dean at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year, replacing Katherine Stanton, now the assistant dean of undergraduate education.
Undergraduates in Currier expressed mixed feelings about Diop-Frimpong’s performance as resident dean and many said that they rarely interacted with her.
“I’m really not particularly familiar with her. She wasn’t a particularly hot topic of conversation,” said Currier resident Louis R. Evans ’13.
Of those who knew her, many students said that she was extremely nice and approachable.
“She’s very kind and she seems very easygoing,” said Currier resident Peter A.D. Curtis.
But some students were critical of Diop-Frimpong.
An e-mail sent Wednesday over Currier Underground—an e-mail list exclusively for Currier undergraduates­—criticized Diop-Frimpong as resident dean, saying that she was absent at House events and she did not promptly respond to e-mails.
The e-mail suggested that Diop-Frimpong was applying to be a permanent resident dean and questioned whether she would do well in such a role.
Some Currier residents echoed some of the e-mail’s objections during interviews yesterday.
“There were some students who felt she wasn’t doing as good a job as she could have,” said Currier resident Rebecca Bergena ’13.
Others said that they had heard few complaints regarding Diop-Frimpong’s performance before the e-mail was sent over Currier Underground.
“The e-mail was the first I heard of it,” said Currier resident Meylakh M. Barshay ’13.
“She was a good resident dean,” said Currier resident Megan M. Blewett ’11. “I’ve never had any problems with her. Whenever I needed something from her, she always responded.”

Professor Rohit Deshpande of the Harvard Business School will soon make public his recent documentary-style case study on the bravery and sacrifice of Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel employees during the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks.
Titled “Terror at the Taj Bombay: Customer-Centric Leadership,” the study analyzes the company loyalty that motivated the Taj employees to sacrifice their own lives to save the hotel’s guests during the attacks rather than flee from the hotel.
Twelve of the thirty-one victims in the building were hotel employees.
During a trip to Mumbai to study the branding exercises of Indian business Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces and its parent company, the Tata Group, Deshpande said the topic of the attacks on the property and employee leadership kept arising in conversation.
“This deserved a whole separate research trip and case study to learn how they managed through that crisis,” Deshpande said.
At the conclusion of his week-long research, which included interviews with receptionists, security personnel, chefs, and management up through Chairman Ratan N. Tata, Deshpande assembled a small team of multimedia specialists to aid him in developing the case study.
The end product, he said, is an approximately 30 minute-long documentary about the employees’ actions during the attacks that highlights local footage and security camera recordings.
Deshpande said he expects the study to one day be used in business schools domestically and abroad to teach students about the impact that effective management can have on employee loyalty.
“The case itself is currently a teaching vehicle developed primarily for use by our students in Harvard Business School,” he said. “My hope is that it will eventually be taught in business schools across the world and that one day we’ll see it used outside of business schools.”
He said he hopes the study will impart on students three critical points. The first principle, he said, was that in emergency situations ordinary people are capable of doing extraordinary things; the second principle suggests that in order to understand how employees act during crises, it is critical to evaluate their employer’s recruitment, training, and rewards programs; the third take-away principle, he said, is that the attacks in Mumbai and the heroic actions of the Taj’s employees did not represent an isolated incident.
When elaborating on the third point, Deshpande referenced the recent shooting in Tuscon. That instance, he said, represented the universality of unlikely heroes stepping up during times of emergency.
“The recent attacks are not something that happened only at the Taj hotel,” he said. “These sorts of acts happen all over the place, and we need to understand more about the heroes who emerge from them.”

The latest social networking initiative to emerge from the minds of Harvard undergraduates—a site called Newsle—seeks to provide users with streaming updates on friends, co-workers, and public figures.
Newsle—a portmanteau of “news” and “people”—allows users to import contacts from social networking sites like Facebook and LinkedIn. It then tracks relevant online stories about those individuals published in news sites and blogs in a user-friendly newsfeed format.
The site is the brainchild of Axel R. Hansen ’13 and Jonah L. Varon ’13, computer science concentrators in Quincy House who met as roommates freshman year. The pair said they launched the site in hopes of personalizing the way they follow their friends’ activities.
While sites like Twitter and Facebook also allow users to track the activity of individuals in the user’s social circle, they often generate too much “noise”—or unwanted information—in their live feeds, the organizers said.
“Newsle is unique in the Internet world, [where] Facebook is one side of the coin and Google News is the other,” added Hansen. “There really isn’t anything that does this.”
The website, currently available in a beta version, has so far tracked over one million news stories, including stories from both small and major outlets.
The Newsle interface provides a stream of information—much like the main page of Twitter or Facebook—about the user’s contacts and allows the user to filter for content about one’s friends and other information about public figures.
“It’s almost laid out like a planner—cool and intuitive,” said Eli A. Kozminsky ’14, one of 2,000 beta testers for the site. “You don’t lose that tactile sensation, like flipping through a magazine,” he said.
“It’s really awesome that two young undergraduates put together this awesome-looking website, but also useful,” he added.
The site’s organizers said they plan to publicly launch Newsle in two weeks, which they say will allow them to gain a clearer picture of the project’s future.
According to Hansen and Varon, the most challenging step in the site’s development lay in writing the algorithms that discriminate between people with identical names and those that sort the relative importance of news articles.
“Our ultimate goal is to change the way people consume news,” Varon said. “If you follow a topic in two weeks, the topic won’t be the news anymore, but if you’re following a person who’s behind it, you’ll be able to keep following all sorts of interesting stories.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers have confirmed speculations made 65 years ago by author Vladimir Nabokov regarding the evolution of Polyommatus blue butterflies.
Nabokov, whose works include “Lolita” and “Pale Fire,” was also the curator of lepidoptera at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. He released a paper in 1945 hypothesizing that the butterflies had migrated from Asia to North America and then South America millions of years ago. He proposed that they did so in a series of five waves over time.
At the time that his paper was released, few scientists took his theories seriously. When he passed away in 1977, his paper remained unproven.
Naomi E. Pierce, a professor of biology and a co-author of the paper that intends to prove Nabokov’s theories, currently occupies the same curator role that Nabokov held years ago. She said that she was inspired to look into Nabokov’s hypotheses after reading “Nabokov’s Blues,” a book about the author’s research on the blue butterflies of South America.
“When I was reading that book, I realized that we could test his ideas with a lot of things we were doing,” Pierce said.
Over ten years, Pierce and her team went on seven separate trips to the Andes, collecting samples of the blue butterflies. They then sequenced the butterflies’ genes in order to determine the relationship between the species and to establish the time period when each distinct species evolved.
Pierce and her colleagues discovered that not only were the species they identified all related to a common ancestor, but that—as Nabokov had stated over six decades ago—the butterflies had originated in Asia and traveled to North America via the Berring Strait.
The researchers also proved that the insects had arrived in North America over five separate waves, exactly as Nabokov had hypothesized.
“Of all the moments in this whole Pierce said. “We realized that his timing chronologically was correct.  That was pretty exciting.”
At the time when he was writing his paper, Nabokov acknowledged that his hypothesis regarding how blue butterflies reached South America appeared absurd.
“I find it easier to give a friendly little push to some of the forms and hang my distributional horseshoes on the nail of Nome [Alaska] rather than postulate transoceanic land-bridges in other parts of the world,” Nabokov wrote.
According to Professor of English Leland de la Durantaye, Nabokov’s interest in butterflies carried over to his literary works.
Svetlana Boym, a professor of Slavic languages and literatures who wrote a book about Nabokov, said that butterflies were very important to the author’s life.
“I am very happy to learn that Nabokov’s scientific theories about the migration of butterflies have been proven right, at last,” Boym wrote in an e-mail. “I am also not surprised.”

Roughly 120 students participated in a financial industry boot camp sponsored by the Office of Career Services last weekend, where a professional training organization lectured on corporate valuation and finance modeling in an effort to prepare students for internships and jobs on Wall Street.
“The purpose is to provide the same level of instruction that students would get in a corporate finance class at an undergraduate business school, or from training at a bank,” said Elizabeth C. Likovich ’07, a business tutor in Dunster and one of the organizers of the event.
“Given that Harvard doesn’t have as many corporate finance classes as some other undergraduate universities, the workshop is certainly helpful,” said Jason J. Sunderson ’01 from William Blair & Company, which accepts no more than five or six Harvard students for internships and jobs out of approximately 100 students that apply annually.
The sessions from 9 to 4 on Saturday and Sunday were organized by OCS and Harvard Pre-Professional Development, a new student group which provides job training in the finance, non-profit, entrepreneurship and consulting sectors. The boot camp featured lectures by a professional training company, Training the Street, as well as networking sessions with investment firms and sponsors William Blair & Company, Jefferies, and Lazard.
“The speakers are very engaging and it was a good pace,” said Jane J. Choi ’12, who is interested in finance and is currently in the recruiting process. “A lot of the information is actually online, but the presenters made things clear by pointing out what’s important.”
Participants unfamiliar with the financial industry may have found the workshops challenging, but this is the way companies train interns during the summer, according to Ashtynn B. Baltimore ’13, one of the event organizers who founded the Pre-Professional Development group.
“It was very fast-paced and gave a lot of information, but people who have a background in finance were participating and asking questions,” said Christine Y. H. Cho ’12, who is considering a career in finance but has no previous experience.
The Pre-Professional Development student group was founded by Baltimore, who interned at Morgan Stanley last summer as a freshman and whose brother is an investment banker at Credit Suisse. Baltimore said the group was inspired by her and her brother’s work experiences, which allowed her to see the difficulties of being a first year analyst.
“There are certain things that are lacking at the undergraduate level that could better prepare [students] to go [into finance],” Baltimore said. “You are usually evaluated in the mid-weeks [of the internship], but if you are only using those first weeks to get acquainted with the materials, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage. We want to get rid of that disadvantage.”

Otto Pizza, a gourmet specialty pizza restaurant, opened its Harvard Square location on Saturday, filling the empty lot on 1432 Mass. Ave. vacated by Finagle a Bagel in August.
After opening their first location in Portland, Maine in June 2009, founders Michael Keon and Anthony Allen started looking into bringing the pizzeria to Harvard Square about a year ago. The move-in process took the past two and a half months.
Instead of providing a large display board of menu items, the restaurant encourages customers to ask employees about the 24 varieties of pizzas as well as those on display behind the counter.
“We don’t have a menu because we really like to talk to people and explain our pizzas,” said Tyler R. Stratton, general manager of the Harvard Square location. “We see lots of people in the window looking in and wondering what types of pizzas we have.”
The pizzeria highlights their specialty pizzas, which use innovative combinations of toppings, such as butternut squash, ricotta cheese, and cranberries.
“Part of our whole business motto is being simple but doing it correctly,” Stratton said. “We want to be efficient.”
For example, all the prices include taxes and are rounded to the nearest whole dollar. A slice of pizza costs $3, and a 7.5-ounce can of soda costs $1.
Although there are several pizza places open in Harvard Square, including Oggi Gourmet and Pinocchio’s, the workers said they are not intimidated by competition.
“Two blocks is a world away here [in Harvard Square],” Stratton said. “We’re in a great location across from Harvard Yard and between two T stops.”
The restaurant hopes to offer delivery on campus and to local businesses. Stratton added that they are planning a free slice day in the near future.
“We do insane business up in Portland. We’re pretty confident here,” Stratton said. “We’re really going to focus on making this place great.”
Otto Pizza is open Sunday to Thursday from 10:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. and Friday and Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 2 a.m.

A streaking Columbia team, having won eight of its last nine games, came into Lavietes Pavilion Friday night looking to establish itself as a league contender. But the Lions will likely need to go back to the drawing board, as the Harvard men’s basketball team used a dominant second-half performance to secure a 77-66 win.
“It was a very competitive game. We knew we were going to get their best shot. We knew the game was going to be fast-paced, physical,” sophomore guard Brandyn Curry said. “This is the kind of game we expected.”
After a close first half, which ended in a 33-32 Crimson lead, Harvard began to make its run early in the second frame, when a steal by Curry started a fast break. Curry passed ahead to junior co-captain Oliver McNally, who then tipped the ball to sophomore forward Kyle Casey, and the big man capped the play with a two-handed slam.
“Oliver had a real nice touch pass, and I took off,” Casey said. “I was expecting it, so I just got bouncy.”
The very next possession, after the Crimson corralled the defensive rebound, Curry launched a long outlet pass to McNally, and the guard fed junior co-captain Keith Wright running to the hoop. Wright flushed home a dunk to give Harvard a 45-38 lead.
A minute later, the Crimson was on another break, and McNally dished to Wright under the basket, where the big man finished with his second jam. At that point, the Crimson led, 50-41, with 14:26 remaining. After Harvard’s next points—a pair of McNally free throws—Harvard’s lead never dipped below double digits for the rest of the contest.
“We knew the tempo would be really fast—that’s kind of the way we play. We like to get up and down,” Casey said.
Sophomore guard Christian Webster quelled any chance of a Columbia comeback. Returning to action after missing last Saturday’s game with a hip pointer, Webster hit three consecutive three-pointers in four Crimson possessions to stretch an 11-point lead to 18.
“He made some big shots,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was really nice to see the rhythm and confidence that he had.”
Webster’s 16 points were good for third-best on the team after McNally and Casey, who each tallied 17. Friday’s contest was Casey’s best game of the season. The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, who is still recovering from a broken foot suffered in the offseason, went 7-of-13 from the field, scoring in a variety of ways—face-up jumpers, drives, step backs—and he grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds.
“He’s a scorer,” Curry said. “I don’t think there’s anybody in the league that can match up with him. There are so many mismatches because he’s so athletic. He can shoot over people; he can drive by the bigger guys. Our emphasis is definitely to get him the ball.”
The Lions had their own superlative performances from guards Brian Barbour and Noruwa Agho. Barbour extended his streak of consecutive games in double-digit scoring to seven with 19 points. Agho bounced back from a 1-for-12 shooting night in his last game against Cornell to score a season-high 27 points. The senior went 10-of-20 from the field, hit two threes, and finished three and-ones.
“[Agho’s] a monster offensive player. He’s hard to guard, moves well without the ball, shoots it off the catch, drives it, finishes—he’s so strong going to the goal,” Amaker said. “Very, very difficult player to defend.”
On the night, the Crimson held Columbia to 37.8 percent shooting from the field and 33.3 percent from deep.
The win, which was Harvard’s seventh straight on the season and 12th straight at home, gave the Crimson a one-game lead in the Ivy standings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference one year can make.
A season removed from suffering two disappointing losses at the hands of Cornell, the Harvard men’s basketball team took a step toward gaining retribution against the three-time defending Ivy League champions Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
Led by its powerful front-court duo of junior co-captain Keith Wright and sophomore Kyle Casey, the Crimson (15-3, 4-0 Ivy) picked up a 78-57 victory against the Big Red (4-14, 0-4).
“They smacked us last year [on the road], and then we had a tough loss at home to them,” Casey said. “We all came in here with a little extra juice and a little extra fire, and I think we executed pretty well.”
After a disappointing first half in which Casey was held to just two points and one rebound, the forward exploded in the second half with 14 points and eight rebounds, helping Harvard extend its 10-point halftime lead up to 24.
But Casey wasn’t the only Crimson forward to put up big numbers.
Wright—Casey’s front-court mate in the starting lineup—picked up his seventh double-double of the season, finishing with 21 points and 11 rebounds, both game highs.
While Wright and Casey provided strong production in the post, also crucial to the Crimson’s success was its guard play.
Harvard combined for 17 assists while committing just four turnovers, a season-low.
Junior guard Oliver McNally and sophomore guard Brandy Curry led the way, handing out seven assists apiece.
Curry had the hot hand in the game’s opening minutes, connecting on two treys in the first five minutes of play to help Harvard establish an early 13-3 lead.
Cornell responded with a 7-0 run highlighted by a two-handed slam from Adam Wire to cut its deficit to three.
But sophomore forward Jeff Georgatos ended the Big Red run, nailing his first career three-pointer off a pass from Curry to put the Crimson up by six.
The Crimson continued to rely on the long ball throughout the first half, connecting on 8-of-16 deep attempts in the opening frame.
With six minutes to play in the first and Harvard up 30-22, Cornell cut another chunk out of Harvard’s lead, thanks to a run led by Big Red sophomore Errick Peck. Peck sparked the run by corralling a missed three-point attempt from teammate Drew Ferry and powering to the basket for the easy bucket.
On the other end, Crimson freshman Laurent Rivard missed an open look from beyond the arc, and the visitors pulled down the rebound.
Peck struck again, this time sinking a three off the dribble to pull the Big Red back within three and forcing Harvard coach Tommy Amaker to burn a timeout.
But that’s as close as Cornell would get.
Coming out of the timeout, the Crimson gave the ball to Wright, who put the ball on the floor and finished with a spinning layup.
Sophomore Christian Webster nailed a triple on Harvard’s next possession to put the Crimson back up by eight.
Harvard closed out the half on a strong note, as Rivard knocked down a 25-footer with just seconds on the clock to give the Crimson a 10-point lead heading into the break.
“It was very big,” said Amaker of Rivard’s deep ball. “That gave us the double-digit margin that we were trying to get throughout the first half.”
But Harvard would have to withstand one more Cornell run before it could cruise to the victory.
Coming out of the break, the Big Red jumped out on a 7-2 run to get within five. Peck played a crucial role in Cornell’s success once again, finishing an acrobatic alley-oop and an and-one layup for five of his team-high 15 points.
“Peck is a tough matchup,” Amaker said. “He’s strong, [and] he’s physical. He can play inside and out.”
“He’s really fluid and he’s really athletic,” added Casey, who was charged with the primary task of defending Peck. “I definitely respect him as a player.”
But within less than two minutes, Harvard built its lead back into double digits, relying on a pair of layups from Wright and a pretty spin move from Casey in the post.
The Crimson also put the clamps down defensively, forcing the Big Red to miss its next three shot attempts.
“I think, defensively, we just locked up a lot better,” Casey said. “Communication kind of picked up, and defensive intensity picked up. And our defense always leads to our offense, so I think that’s kind of how we kind of turned it around.”
A three-pointer from Rivard with 16:34 to play set the lead at 14, and the Crimson’s lead never dipped below 12 the rest of the way, reaching 24 with under four minutes to play.
With Saturday’s victory over Cornell and Friday’s win against Columbia, Harvard improves to 4-0 in the Ivy League and extended its home winning streak to 13 games—a program record.
“I was very pleased with the effort we displayed both nights defensively,” Amaker said. “Obviously, a gratifying weekend for us.”

Coming off its first win in eight games, the Harvard men’s hockey team (4-16-0, 3-12-0 ECAC) hoped to ride a wave of positive momentum into its Saturday night matchup against rival Cornell (9-9-3, 7-5-2).
But before a rowdy sold-out crowd at Bright Hockey Center, the Big Red’s freshman goaltender Andy Iles ruined any chance for two consecutive victories. The rookie made 33 stops against a determined Crimson offense en route to a 2-1 win.
“We certainly had enough chances there to get the equalizer…but weren’t able to get one by [Iles],” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Hats off—I thought their goaltending was outstanding and they did enough to win.”
Iles was put to work almost immediately. The Crimson went on the power play just 36 seconds into the game, when Cornell forward Sean Collins was whistled for boarding.
Harvard registered six unanswered shots on goal in the two minute period, including a dangerous wraparound attempt from junior forward Alex Killorn, but could not convert.
In spite of early Crimson pressure, the Big Red got on the scoreboard first at 4:45 in the first period. Following a poor clearance attempt, Cornell defenseman Braden Birch gained control of the puck before passing to teammate Mike Devin. The veteran’s one-timer—Cornell’s first shot of the game—found its way through traffic and into the back of the net.
“We had six or seven shots before they even got one and they bounced back,” Donato said. “They’re a smart team, and they work hard, and they’re able to bend and not break.”
The Crimson responded with a goal of its own later in the period. Sophomore forward Alex Fallstrom intercepted the puck in the Big Red’s zone and maneuvered his way past two defenders before firing it into the top left corner of the net.
The score was the second in as many days for the Swedish native, who returned to the ice earlier this month after a 10-game absence.
With the game tied at 1-1, both teams came into the second period firing on all cylinders.
Tensions reached a boiling point at 16:30 in the second frame, when Cornell forward Rodger Craig and sophomore defenseman Brendan Rempel were both whistled for roughing, though the latter was assessed a double-minor.
With the one-man advantage, Big Red forward Locke Jillson beat senior netminder Ryan Carroll to make it 2-1.
“We probably took an ill-advised penalty on what ultimately became the game-winning goal,” Donato said. “In a game this close, obviously the small details can make a big difference.”
The Crimson looked for the equalizer in the third, peppering Iles with attempt after attempt. Harvard held an 11-3 shot advantage for the period.
“We came out in the third hard and went to the net as hard as we could,” co-captain Chris Huxley said.
The best chance to tie came with about eight minutes left, during one of the Crimson’s three power play opportunities in the period.
Killorn fired the puck across the crease, and Huxley attempted to redirect it into the net. Iles managed to smother the would-be equalizer with his body.
A video review upheld referees’ call of no goal.
Harvard saw another golden opportunity thwarted by Iles with six minutes left to play when sophomore defenseman Danny Biega’s shot from point-blank range was tipped over the net.
Saturday’s defeat marked the Crimson’s fifth consecutive loss to Cornell after being swept in last year’s regular-season matchups. But this time around, Harvard held the offensive advantage, outshooting the Big Red, 34-20, on the night.
“We worked hard and we had our chances,” Donato said. “I’m sure the kids are frustrated but it wasn’t from a lack of effort. Their goalie was outstanding and I give them credit because I thought they played a smart game.”
“It’s not that we’re happy with a loss because that’s just not possible, but we played hard and you can’t be mad at that,” Huxley added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling on the wrong side of several close decisions over the past two months, the Harvard men’s hockey team left little doubt as to who had played the better game on Friday night at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson (4-16, 3-12 ECAC) earned its third win in conference play, beating Colgate (3-21-2, 0-12-2), 6-2, in a game that finally saw Harvard’s improved play come to fruition.
“I think we’ve worked awfully hard over the past few games and haven’t really been rewarded,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91. “So it’s nice to see the puck go in the net...we’re happy to get the win.”
Both teams went into Friday’s matchup coming off of long winless streaks, and each was looking for something to fall in their favor.
“The energy was good, both teams played hard,” said Red Raiders’ coach Don Vaughan. “Both of us were looking for something to jumpstart our seasons and get us going.”
Colgate got the game going Friday night when it struck first on a goal from sophomore forward Robbie Bourdon just under eight minutes into the game.
But before the announcer had even finished the Red Raiders’ goal summary, the Crimson struck back.
Senior forward Michael Biega took possession after a battle for the puck and passed to sophomore teammate Connor Morrison, who redirected it just enough to put the puck into the slot.
Sophomore Danny Biega was there to knock in a shot that sailed past the Colgate goaltender, tying up the score within 13 seconds of the Red Raiders’ first goal.
After the quick shift in momentum, Harvard capitalized again before the end of the frame.
Freshman John Caldwell got the puck out of the Crimson’s defensive zone to sophomore teammate Marshall Everson, who skated to the other end of the ice before dropping a tricky pass back through the Colgate defense to sophomore Alex Fallstrom. Fallstrom put it in for Harvard’s first lead of the game, as he and Caldwell both registered their first points of the season.
After the break, things didn’t change, and the Crimson’s offense kept the pressure on the Red Raiders. After a Colgate forward was called for holding midway through the second period, Harvard got its first power play opportunity of the night.
The Red Raiders appeared to be controlling the play—even with a man down— but Crimson junior Alex Killorn got the puck out to Danny Biega, who exchanged a few passes with captain Chris Huxley before getting a shot off from the blue line.
“To be honest, I don’t even think the goalie saw it,” Biega said of his second goal. “The power play was moving around really well...and we had a really good screen in front of the net.”
Converting on the man-up opportunity was one thing that Harvard’s coach noted as an instrumental change in getting the victory.
“I think the same things that were costing us games were flipped around to win a game [on Friday],” Donato said.
Colgate switched up its goalies in hopes of putting a stop to the Crimson’s scoring spree, but Killorn, Harvard’s leading scorer, wouldn’t relent, putting in a tricky shot for Harvard’s fourth unanswered goal of the game to make it 4-1 just before the close of the second period.
The Red Raiders were clearly feeling the heat as they entered the final frame with a three-goal deficit.
About a minute in, Colgate senior forward Francois Brisebois found the back of the net, getting the puck past Harvard’s senior goaltender Ryan Carroll.
The Red Raiders seemed to be picking up the pace, but a strong defensive effort by Carroll and the rest of the Harvard defense allowed the Crimson to keep its comfortable lead.
“[Carroll] gave us a calming effect and made some big saves,” Donato said of the netminder who had 27 saves on the night. “I think he does such a great job being relaxed in there...[and] it plays into how the team plays in front of him as far as being composed in our own zone.”
As time wound down, Colgate pulled its goalie with a few minutes left, and Harvard did not waste the opportunity. Morrison scored first on the open net, and after a late charging penalty on the Red Raiders, Danny Biega sealed his hat trick with a goal from behind the Crimson’s own blue line.
The final goals marked the late-scoring pattern that dominated Harvard’s 6-2 victory.
“We got a lead and we couldn’t hold it for more than 20 seconds, and then we gave up two goals in the last two minutes of the first and second period,” the Red Raiders’ coach said. “Those are backbreakers.”
Donato and Danny Biega agreed that just a few moments were enough to determine the outcome of the game.
“Unfortunately for Colgate, I thought they looked a little bit like us when we’ve lost games—where they’ve worked hard or they had great chances, and then the puck just comes down to the other end and goes in the net,” Donato said.
“Last weekend we played hard, we played really well, but we just didn’t get the bounces,” Biega added. “You know, every game there’s some luck involved, and the puck just seemed to fly in the back of the net for us tonight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team is hitting its stride at the right time. After struggling at the beginning of the season, the Crimson (12-7-2, 11-3-2 ECAC) has turned things around just as the ECAC playoff race heats up, winning seven of its last eight contests. Harvard’s two wins at Brown and Yale this weekend showed just how far the Crimson has come since it first took the ice.
“I think we’re a completely different team,” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “I think we’ve come together. We’ve had a lot of lowerclassmen step up and play a lot harder than they thought they could.”
Harvard’s new versatility shined during the weekend, as seven different players found the back of the net.
“We’ve evolved,” Buesser said. “Our system’s better. We’ve stepped it up in our team chemistry. We’re able to settle into our game and how we want to play...We’ve changed for the better.”
HARVARD 5, YALE 3
In its season opener, the Crimson was surprised by a Bulldog squad led by its former assistant coach, Jaokim Flygh.
“We barely tied them [the first time],” tri-captain Liza Ryabkina said.
But while Flygh and Yale (5-14-2, 4-9-1) continued to provide a challenge on the ice, Harvard was ready on Saturday.
“We knew we were going to have to fight,” Ryabkina said.
The Crimson drew first blood four and a half minutes into the game when sophomore Jillian Dempsey scored off an intercepted pass.
But less than six minutes later, rookie Jenna Ciotti evened the score.
The back and forth nature of the game continued throughout all three periods with the team’s going goal-for-goal and nearly shot for shot. The contest finished with Harvard barely outshooting the Bulldogs, 30-24.
“I was really impressed with how efficient and hard working they were,” Ryabkina said. “It’s partly a testament to our ex-coach, Joakim. You could definitely see that they were sticking to their game plan. They kept coming back.”
But while Yale was able to keep the game competitive, it was never able to take the lead.
“I think the [difference] was being able to respond,” Buesser said. “Every time they were able to score a goal or have a shot, we were able to counter really well.”
Early in the second period, freshman Lyndsey Fry and Ryabkina scored back-to-back goals to put the Crimson up, 3-1, and the Bulldogs were again able to even up the score.
Harvard would not even allow Yale the final say on its own ice. When Bulldog junior Aleca Hughes brought her team within one with two minutes left to play, it seemed that Yale would finish the game with only a one-goal loss.
But with 15 seconds left in regulation, Buesser and classmate Katharine Chute scored on an empty net to put the final margin at two.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 0
The results were the same, but the games were completely different.
In October, the Bears (2-16-3, 1-10-3) kept the game competitive, and the Crimson got through with a two-goal win. But on Friday, the margin better reflected the difference between the ECAC’s second- and second-to-last place teams.
“One thing was being able to come out fast,” Buesser said. “We were able to knock them on their heels. We kept up that tempo and got a lot of scoring opportunities.”
Ryabkina struck first, rebounding a missed shot by Dempsey and stuffing the puck into the net.
“We’ve been working on shooting: getting low, getting rebounds,” the tri-captain said.
Ryabkina’s goal also marked the first goal the team had scored with its new powerplay strategy.
“We switched our powerplays this past week,” Ryabkina said. “We did a good job capitalizing on the opportunities.”
But while Ryabkina scored the game-winner in the first ten minutes of ice time, Harvard didn’t hit its stride until the second period when it scored three goals in 15 minutes.
Sophomore Josephine Pucci and freshman Marissa Gedman scored on even strength goals while Buesser tallied the final goal on a powerplay at 15:40.
“The goals weren’t easy goals,” Ryabkina said. “That’s just sort of how our team is.”
Meanwhile, on the other end of the ice, sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy secured her second straight shut out. Bellamy saw more action than she had in the Crimson’s previous matchup against Union—25 shots as opposed to 10—but her success was identical.
“She’s played very consistently,” Buesser said. “That’s exactly what we want from her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nabbing both a close victory and a blowout this weekend, Harvard women’s basketball has proven that it could pull out wins in a variety of circumstances.
The Crimson (11-6, 3-0 Ivy) faced the possibility of dropping a conference game at Columbia (3-15, 2-2) on Friday night until rookie Christine Clark saved the day, sinking a jumper with under four seconds left on the clock to win the game, 69-68. Harvard shook off the scare the next day to face a humble Cornell squad (5-13, 2-2) that didn’t put up much of a fight. The Crimson dropped the Big Red on the road, 67-36.
“We’re happy to come out of the weekend with two wins,” co-captain Christine Matera said. “The Columbia game was too close for comfort. [Clark] hit a huge shot and [sophomore Victoria Lippert] and [junior Brogan Berry] really carried us through the second half. But most importantly, we came out with two wins.”
HARVARD 67, CORNELL 36
After nearly losing the night before, the Crimson came out prepared on Saturday to avoid a similar situation, scoring more points in the first half than Cornell did in the entire game. Harvard posted 38 points in the first half and kept the Big Red to 18 points in each period.
“I think whenever we don’t play as well as we could have, the team gathers itself and plays better the next game,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “I had a lot of confidence going into the Cornell game. I think we’re deep enough [on the roster] and ready to play back-to-back.”
Despite the significant margin in the final score, the game started out close, with Cornell keeping up with the Crimson and leading, 9-8. Sophomore Miriam Rutzen then hit a pair of treys to ignite an 8-0 run that set the tempo of the contest. It was the start of another strong showing from Rutzen, who scored 12 points and swatted away five shots in the win.
“Miriam is a veteran now,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Rutzen], who didn’t play well Friday night, played extraordinarily on Saturday night.”
Classmate Victoria Lippert led the way with 15 points and five rebounds on the night. Senior forward Emma Markley, tied with Lippert for second on the team in scoring, did not play due to a minor injury sustained in the game against Columbia.
An eight-minute stretch ensued towards the end of the first half, when the Crimson kept the Big Red nearly scoreless, 21-2. Harvard shot an impressive 55.6 percent from the field in the first half.
“I think Cornell has a lot of new and young players,” Delaney-Smith said of the run. “Always, at the beginning of every game, it’s feeling each other out and making game adjustments, and basically that’s what we did.”
The second half started out with a 13-2 Crimson scoring blitz to push the deficit up to 30. Cornell sporadically scored throughout the period and had a small run with four minutes remaining to lower the margin to 25, but Harvard countered by widening the final gap to 31.
The Big Red experienced serious shooting woes, mustering a 22.9 field-goal percentage compared to Harvard’s 43.1 percent.
Like the Crimson, Cornell only had two players in double figures. Clare Fitzpatrick and Taylor Flynn each scored 10 points, with Fitzpatrick making only 3-of-15 shots.
Though Harvard only had Lippert and Rutzen with double-digit point totals, the Crimson exhibited a balanced offense throughout the night, one that had 11 players contribute to the final score.
HARVARD 69, COLUMBIA 68
Despite the Crimson shooting 45.8 percent compared to Columbia’s 40.3 percent, Harvard had to rely on a precocious rookie to preserve its unblemished Ivy record.
On the final possession of the game, Clark grabbed the offensive rebound off her failed attempt and hit a 12-foot game-winner—angled from behind the backboard, no less—with 3.1 seconds remaining.
“[Clark] is a competitor,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s what she’s going to do all four years. She has never played like a freshman...she had a lot of poise and hit a big shot for us.”
Both the Lions and Harvard scored 38 points in the second period, and it was a one-point difference in the second half that made all the difference. The home team gave the Crimson a battle throughout, especially when it came to rebounds. Columbia grabbed 43 boards compared to Harvard’s 33.
“Welcome to the Ivy League, is what I think,” Delaney-Smith said of the Lions’ performance. “I’m not surprised at Columbia. I feel that the wins-loss record isn’t always indicative about what’s going to be on the floor in Ivy competition.”
“I don’t think we did horribly, but we didn’t play our best game either,” Delaney-Smith concluded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Blink a couple of times, and you would have missed it.
Ninety seconds into Friday night’s men’s basketball matchup against Columbia, sophomore wing Christian Webster drove baseline and hit a reverse layup—allaying concerns about his recently injured hip while giving the Crimson an early 4-2 lead.
Just nine seconds later, Lions star Noruwa Agho drove to his right and banked in a floater to tie the game. Harvard sophomore Brandyn Curry led an immediate fast break off the made basket, going coast to coast for a layup.
The early three-possession sequence—a trio of baskets scored in 17 seconds of action—illustrated the ability of both Ivy squads to push the pace, of which the Crimson took great advantage on its way to a 77-66 win.
Boasting the highest-scoring offense in the league and the 78th-fastest tempo in the nation, the Lions were beaten at their own game. Harvard accumulated 16 fast-break points by game’s end on the willingness of players like Curry and junior co-captain Oliver McNally to look up the court and move the ball.
“Coach is always telling me to set the pace, get the ball in the goal,” Curry said. “Every time I get the ball, I’m looking to push. Our first look is to score something in transition.”
To be sure, the Crimson made mistakes getting back on defense, giving up several easy lay-ins in the first half. But it was emphatic second-half scores in transition that both pleased the crowd and helped permanently extend Harvard’s lead.
AGHO A GO GO
Columbia’s hopes of springing a road upset centered on the play of Agho, who averages a league-best 16.9 points per game.
The Lion leader may have picked up a season-high 27 points during his latest trip to Lavietes, but it took him 20 field goal tries to do so. In hopes of slowing the sharpshooter, Amaker threw a number of defenders at him, including the physical Curry, Webster, and rookie guard Matt Brown.
Also a wide receiver on the football team, the imposing Brown received a season-high 18 minutes against Columbia, a strong follow-up to his performance in the team’s previous game against Dartmouth.
“We needed him to try to guard Agho,” Amaker said. “Matt has a role for us, being a physical guard on the perimeter. We rely on him, and we can count on him.”
Backcourt stalwarts Agho and sophomore Brian Barbour—Columbia’s only double-digit scorers—gave Harvard’s defense trouble all night, both on shooting from the outside and driving into the paint.
“They like to dribble the ball a lot, they get a lot of screens, and they’re crafty with the ball,” Curry said. “You got to stay disciplined, you got to stay down, you got to fight through the screens.”
But during the game’s key run, it was a pair of missed layups by Agho and Barbour, added to an Agho turnover, which set up Harvard’s momentum-changing baskets in transition.
TRUE GRIT
While Harvard certainly prides itself on its offensive balance, Friday night was all about the team’s toughness.
Taking a season-low 11 three-point attempts, the Crimson dominated the paint, totaling 40 points inside to its opponent’s 22.
Sophomore forward Kyle Casey and junior co-captain Keith Wright had 23 field goal attempts, nearly half of the team’s total. And faced with the big men of the top rebounding team in the Ancient Eight, the front-court pair picked up a combined 20 rebounds, helping their team win the overall battle, 40-30.
“He was very active, aggressive, and certainly did a heck of a job on the glass,” Amaker said of Casey. “[He] responded after not having a lot of rebounds against Dartmouth our last game; his turnaround was just outstanding.”
The squad’s six blocks—its most in five games—reinforced the message that Friday’s contest was relatively light on finesse. No player made this clearer than Harvard junior co-captain Oliver McNally, who went to the floor hard on several occasions.
“He got whacked around a bit,” Amaker said. “But I didn’t want to substitute for him. I wanted to make sure he got his butt up and leave him in the game.”
“I don’t think this team would be even close to as good without Oliver,” Casey added. “He always brings the fight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year ago, a raucous Lavietes Pavilion crowd was silenced by a loaded Cornell squad that shot over 50 percent from behind the arc, drilling 12 three-pointers on its way to a heartbreaking defeat of the Harvard men’s basketball team.
With four of that Big Red team’s five starters now graduated, Harvard turned the tables dramatically Saturday evening in a 78-57 win over visiting Cornell—now occupying the dregs of the Ancient Eight.
The Big Red leads the league in attempts and accuracy from long range, but the Crimson defended the three well, particularly after halftime. The hosts held the opposing squad to 5-of-16 three-point shooting, including only one make in the second half.
“They’ve been a dangerous team from three-point land; they shot 32 last night,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We wanted to defend the three-point line…and see if we could play without fouling. We used that phrase of ‘defend the lines’: the three-point line and the foul line.”
The only remaining starter from last season’s team—which made it all the way to the Sweet 16—junior guard Chris Wroblewski had a difficult night of his own, missing 10 of the 13 shots he took from the field and picking up just seven points, far below his season average of 15.5 per game.
A night after handling Columbia star Noruwa Agho, Crimson sophomore guard Brandyn Curry locked up his next assignment, forcing Wroblewski into difficult opportunities and hampering his ability to make plays.
Unable to convert from the outside and lacking a reliable post presence on its roster, the Big Red’s primary source of offense turned out to be sophomore forward Errick Peck, who had been suffering from stomach problems earlier in the day.
He showed no signs of it, as he tormented the Harvard defense with his athleticism and versatility, dropping 15 points on 6-of-8 shooting from the floor.
Effortlessly drilling a pair of three-pointers, Peck was a force inside too. His athletic three-point play off an offensive rebound cut the Harvard lead to 43-38 two minutes into the second half.
But Peck was the lone scorer in double digits for Cornell—a stark contrast with the firepower of the Crimson.
INSIDE AND OUT
Last season’s Big Red team featured an array of weapons in the paint and beyond the arc. While this year’s Crimson squad may not be ready for a deep run into the NCAA Tournament, it is similarly capable of putting on an offensive showcase from anywhere on the court.
“Balance is the word for us,” Amaker said. “The inside-out combination for us is so critical.”
It worked to great effect Saturday night, when the home squad picked up 17 assists and four turnovers—a season-low.
As they did the night before, sophomore forward Kyle Casey and junior co-captain Keith Wright again led the way for Harvard, attempting 29 shots from the floor and collecting 20 rebounds.
While Peck matched up with Casey, first-year coach Bill Courtney had no answer inside for Wright, who used his size and nimble footwork to score 21 points on mid-range jumpers and up-close looks at the rim.
“Every person they threw at me had something different,” Wright said. “[Adam] Wire’s definitely stronger, so he was leaning on me a little bit more. [Aaron] Osgood, he’s a longer and lengthier guy. I just try to adjust the way I post up and feed off them.”
While the big men eventually got things going, the opening half was defined by Harvard’s ability to drain shots from the outside.
Barely 10 minutes into the night, Harvard had already hit five three-pointers—exceeding its total made against Columbia—a team that pushed the tempo much more than the Big Red.
“Last night, [the Lions] were really up and down, sprinting to the three-point line,” Casey said. “Cornell got in the half court and ran a lot of offense, a lot of screens and things like that.”
Wary of the Crimson’s ability to get to the hoop, the Big Red stuffed the lane and mixed things up with a zone defense.
But looking for fewer baskets in transition, Harvard gave Cornell a taste of its own medicine, launching triples off the dribble and nailing 8-of-16 attempts in the first half.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second year in a row, Harvard women’s swimming and diving completed its regular season 6-1, with the sole blemish on its otherwise perfect Ivy League record coming at the hands of Princeton.
This past weekend at the annual HYP meet, hosted this year by Yale, the Crimson handily topped the Bulldogs, 217-83, but lost to the Tigers, 207-93. The split result at the HYP meet was strong enough to earn Harvard a second place in the final Ivy standings.
In diving competition, Harvard comprised three of the top-five finishes in the three-meter event—led by senior Jenny Reese in second place and sophomore Brittany Powell and junior Leslie Rea in third and fourth places, respectively.
Rea also clinched second place in the one-meter dive. Senior Kate Mills added a third-place performance in the 200-yard freestyle, registering a 1:51.01 mark, and a runner-up finish in the 200 butterfly, touching in at 2:01.00. Later in the 100-yard backstroke, junior Meghan Leddy gained third place behind Princeton’s Elizabeth Boyce and Merideth Monroe.
“I think our team swam with a lot of heart this weekend,” co-captain Christine Kaufmann said. “Ultimately, our goal comes with the two championships [Ivies and ECACs] at the end of the year, and I think our team is capable of going even a lot faster.”
Senior Katy Hinkle also came in second in the 50-yard freestyle, closely followed by teammate freshman Jenna Gregoire who seized the third-place spot in that race with a time of 23.85 seconds.
Harvard’s first Ivy loss of the 2010-2011 season came against a Tiger squad that swept all 16 events at HYPs in addition to establishing seven new Yale pool and four new Princeton team records.
Among the record-setters was Tiger senior Megan Waters in both the 100 fly and 100 free races.
But Princeton’s momentum from the earliest stages of the meet did not deter the Crimson’s efforts, as Harvard challenged its top rivals until the closing races of the meet.
In Saturday’s final event, Hinkle, Gregoire, co-captain Ali Slack, and Mills achieved a first place finish in the 400 free relay, one of four Crimson quartets that rounded out the top-five performances in that exhibition event.
“We were actually very happy with how our team did,” Hinkle said. “We did what we wanted to do. We went out there and executed our strategies, and we had some of our best season times so far. I think we’re in a good position for the rest of the season.”
With this year’s HYP sweep, Princeton improves its dual-meet streak to 37 wins and is speculated to perhaps be in the running for the new Top 25 national rankings. Meanwhile Yale, which had also possessed a perfect league record prior to the meet, enters its final season contest against Brown next week with two losses under its belt.
“Princeton’s a very strong team, but I think ours is strong as well,” Kaufmann said. “[Ivies] are going to come down to which team has the deepest competition and which has a lot of people who can score highly. As far as focusing now goes, we’d really like to focus on just ourselves in the next couple of weeks.”
All of the Ivy squads are scheduled to converge on Princeton for the Ivy League Championships on Feb. 24-26, a title Harvard lost by only 27 points last year.
“We knew what to expect from the end of this season,” Hinkle said. “This weekend didn’t scare us in any way. We’re prepared to put up a much stronger fight in the championship setting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been a long drought up to this point, but the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team has finally achieved what it could not during the last two years: a victory against the Princeton Tigers.
Yesterday, Harvard beat its Ivy rivals for the first time since 2008, as the Crimson traveled to New Haven, this weekend for the annual HYP meet. Harvard (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) came into the weekend with a perfect record and perfect season on the line. The squad left with that distinction intact, crushing Yale, 266-87, and dropping Princeton by a much closer score, 189-164.
“It felt tremendous,” co-captain Douwe Yntema said. “Everyone on the team swam extraordinarily well. We really came together as a team…it felt excellent to beat [Princeton]. They have been our rivals for quite some time.”
While experience may be the key to winning in most instances, the freshmen stood out this weekend, as they have consistently done all season. In the 200-yard freestyle, freshmen Chris Satterthwaite and Spenser Goodman tied for first place in the event, both finishing in 1:38.99. Sophomore Greg Roop rounded out the top three in the race with a time of 1:39.60.
In the 100-yard freestyle, Satterthwaite notched his second victory of the weekend in 44.91 seconds. He just managed to beat out Matt Lamonaca from Princeton, who completed the race with a time of 45.21 seconds.
Freshman Jack Pretto continued the string of rookie victories when he took first place in the 100-yard backstroke. Pretto clocked in a time of 49.73, just inching out his fellow teammate, junior Rob Newell.
Newell started out the race in front and completed the first 50 yards one hundredth of a second faster than Pretto, but the freshman caught up and eventually passed his teammate to earn the win.
In the 1,650-yard freestyle, freshman Wes Stearns dominated the race, finishing in 15:23.85. Paul Nolle of Princeton came out off the starting block with a slight lead, but Stearns quickly passed him, and the Tiger eventually fell to fourth.
Once Stearns was in front, he remained there for the duration of the race. Sophomore Greg Roop also earned another top-three finish, taking second in the event in 15:28.24.
“It felt really good because I worked really hard this season,” Stearns said of finishing the season with victories in two events. “I didn’t know what to expect, and coming out with the win felt really good.”
The 50-yard freestyle came down to the very end and featured a photo finish, but freshman Oliver Lee narrowly touched the wall in first. Lee finished the race in 20.42, beating out three Princeton competitors who had to settle for second, third, and fourth.
“I’m thrilled for their performances,” Yntema said of the freshmen class’ results. “They came in as a well-ranked class, but exceeded their expectations, and showed that in the last meet.”
In the men’s 200-yard butterfly, Harvard earned another 1-2-3 finish to strengthen its lead over Yale and Princeton. Sophomore Ryan Cutter took first place in the race in 1:48.36, edging out his fellow teammate, junior Niall Janney, who finished the race in 1:49.33. Junior Nicholas Tan was in first after the first 100 meters, but Cutter and Janney passed Tan in the next 100 meters, leaving Tan to pick up third place.
The diving squad also managed to put up some points for the team in its events.
In the three-meter diving event, sophomore Michael Stanton finished in first place, besting Stephen Vines from Princeton and Eric Olson from Yale. Stanton also took first place in the one-meter diving competition to complete the sweep of the diving events for the weekend.
Even though Harvard improved its times in the relay and medley events over last year, the Crimson still failed to pull out a win over the Tigers. In the 400-yard freestyle relay, the Crimson just lost out to the Tigers.
It was the closest relay event of the weekend, with Princeton finishing in 2:59.97 and Harvard taking second with a time of 3:00.05. In the 400-yard relay, Harvard narrowly lost to Princeton again, finishing just one second behind the Tigers.
Despite Princeton’s victories in those events, Harvard still managed to secure the win over its toughest competitor while putting to rest doubts that the squad could beat the Tigers. A 9-0 record and revenge over a rival were the perfect way for the men’s swimming and diving team to end its season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For just the second time since 2003, the Harvard men’s volleyball team has gotten off to a 2-0 start, capturing its second win in as many matches Friday night at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Aided once again by its talented freshman class, the Crimson (2-0) grabbed a 3-1 victory over Endicott (3-3), winning 25-21, 25-21, 21-25, and 25-19.
“We played with confidence,” junior co-captain Matt Jones said. “I’m excited about the way the season is shaping up.”
After notching a team-high 15 kills in Harvard’s season opener against Newbury, Jones turned in another strong performance, finishing with a game-high 20 kills. The outside hitter also chipped in with six digs—second to fellow junior captain Dan Schreff’s seven—and five block assists.
“I think Matt’s been doing a great job of leading our team to victories,” said freshman outside hitter Chris Gibbons. “He’s playing a big role on offense and in passing.”
Gibbons also produced offensively for the Crimson, landing a career-high 16 kills and four digs.
“He had a great night,” Jones said. “First game, we didn’t get him a lot of sets, but tonight the matchup favored him going to the outside.”
Both Gibbons and Jones benefitted from their opponents’ decision to focus on shutting down Harvard’s strong middle hitters—freshmen Kyle Rehkemper and Nick Madden—allowing them to face single blockers on the outside.
“Our freshmen middles are playing really well and that opens it up on the outside,” Jones said. “Also, the setting is so consistent. I’m just going up and hitting the open spot on the court.”
In the first set, the Crimson relied on its powerful offense to pick up its first win, getting 15 of its 25 points off of kills. Harvard jumped out to a 4-2 lead but fell behind, 14-13, midway through the set.
Thanks to a 4-1 run, the Crimson regained the lead, which it maintained for the remained of the set. But Endicott kept it close, pulling within a single point late t. But up 21-20, Harvard closed out the set using a 4-1 run to secure its first win.
The Crimson rode the momentum into the second set, capturing a commanding 6-2 lead. Endicott was unable to recover from its early hole, never cutting its deficit below two and Harvard recorded another 25-21 win.
But things got away from the Crimson in the third set, as the visitors capitalized on Harvard’s 10 hitting errors. The Crimson also struggled passing the ball consistently in the third, something that it had done well in the first two sets.
“[After going up 2-0], I think that sort of got us a little ahead of ourselves,” Gibbons said. “The passers got into a little bit of lull there.”
But Harvard pulled itself together in the fourth set, recording its biggest victory of the match, 25-19.
The Crimson fell behind, 2-1, but rattled off an early 6-1 run to go up 9-5. Harvard’s lead continued to grow from there, and the Crimson closed out the final set with a six-point win.
“I think the team played pretty well,” Gibbons said. “We took advantage of the other team’s weakness. After the third set, we were able to come back and focus in.”
Harvard relied heavily on its passing to pick up the win, something it struggled with in its season opener. After picking up just 22 digs against Newbury, the Crimson recorded 35 on Friday night, with six different players notching at least four digs.
“I think that the passers really did a good job of getting the ball to the setter, and that allowed him to run the offense,” Gibbons said.
Sophomore setter Rob Lothman was the major beneficiary of the team’s solid passing. Lothman finished with a season-high 40 assists.
“[Lothman’s] doing a great job of spreading the ball around and keeping the offense balanced,” Jones said. “He’s making the other team work hard to try and stop us.”
“Rob’s been doing a great job,” Gibbons echoed. “He’s been getting the ball so the hitter can put it away. He’s been a big part of our success.”
The Crimson will look to make it three in a row to open the season—something it has not done since 2008—tomorrow night, when the squad hosts Springfield.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any member of Harvard wrestling will tell you that it’s a long season, but getting an early win never hurts. After struggling for the past few weeks, the Crimson (1-9) earned its first dual victory of 2011 on Saturday, topping Army, 21-12, on the road. Although the momentum did not carry over in a 40-7 loss at No. 7 Lehigh yesterday, Harvard emerged satisfied with its effort on the mat heading into the Ivy League slate.
“I feel like the weekend went really well team-wise,” sophomore Steven Keith said. “We picked up our first win against Army, which had just come off a win against Brown. So, not only were we able to beat them when their spirits were up, but we should be able to beat [some Ivy teams] in the future.”
Of course, a lopsided loss to the Mountain Hawks reminded the Crimson that its work isn’t finished, and Harvard coach Jay Weiss expects his squad to improve.
“It’s not the easiest wrestling environment down at Lehigh,” he said. “Lehigh’s a good team, and they’ve got some top wrestlers…but I think we can walk away learning things from the weekend.”
NO. 7 LEHIGH 40, HARVARD 7
Despite a strong effort in Saturday’s match, the Crimson was no match for the powerful Mountain Hawks (12-5) yesterday at Leeman-Turner Arena. Harvard began the contest with a bang, as Keith (125 lbs.) notched a 10-2 major decision over Mitch Berger to spot his team four points. The win was Keith’s second of the weekend, and Weiss was particularly impressed with the sophomore’s ability to shake off injury.
“Steven and Walter [Peppelman] got banged up [against Army] and weren’t 100 percent today,” Weiss said. “But both wrestled smart and did enough to win.”
According to Keith, the key was simply refusing to be thrown off his game.
“I didn’t really change my approach,” the sophomore said. “I just went into the match and took it head-on and didn’t notice any [pain] until the match was over.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, though, Lehigh—which bested top-ranked Cornell on Jan. 20—responded to the early setback. The Mountain Hawks reeled off a pair of technical falls and a pin in the next three bouts to take a commanding lead. Harvard’s sophomore co-captain Peppelman (157) did his part with a 1-0 decision over Sean Bilodeau, but the win would mark the Crimson’s last for the weekend. Lehigh swept the upper weights, leaving Weiss assured that his team has work to do ahead.
“When you have young guys going against some of the top guys, you just want them to go out and fight more,” the coach said. “The more times we do that, the more they’re going to grow…I think we’re going to be a better team in a couple of months, because I see [that experience] working.”
HARVARD 21, ARMY 12
An eight-match losing streak followed the Crimson to West Point, N.Y., but Harvard departed Arvin Gymnasium with many of those struggles forgotten. In a solid team victory, the Crimson won seven matches against the Black Knights (7-6), five of which featured freshmen or sophomores.
Keith and classmate Shay Warren (133) posted consecutive decisions to begin the day, but the match proved to be a back-and-forth affair. Freshman Joe Marino dropped a 9-2 decision at 141 pounds, and fellow rookie Joe Alie succumbed to a pin after 4:57.
Facing yet another deficit, Harvard turned to its most consistent grappler—Peppelman. The co-captain, who is currently ranked No. 9 in the country, battled to a 7-5 win over Jimmy Rafferty, his team-leading 18th of the season. Peppelman’s emergence this year has proven particularly critical after junior Corey Jantzen (149) went down with a season-ending elbow injury.
“I think losing Corey is a big loss, and having the team literally come back the next time we wrestle and pull off a win against Army, that helps,” Weiss said. “It gets guys to buy in more to what we do training-wise…and gives our guys confidence for the next stretch of Ivy matches.”
But Peppelman was not the only Crimson grappler to step up on Saturday. After sophomore Adam Hogue (165) dropped a 5-2 decision, rookies Ian Roy (174) and Cameron Croy (184) posted back-to-back three-point wins to put Harvard back on top.
With the team’s first victory so close, the Crimson turned to a pair of veterans to lock it down. Junior Bryan Panzano pulled out a crucial 4-3 decision at 197 lbs., and co-captain Andrew Knapp snared a 4-2 sudden victory to seal the match. The win was significant for Knapp, who is in his final season after returning from a knee injury.
“Every time he steps out, [Knapp] is going to continue to get better and shake out that rust,” Weiss said. “He’s got another month and a half of wrestling in his life, and when he realizes that, he’s going to bring out his best.”
Certainly the Crimson will need that effort—along with strong performances throughout its lineup—as the squad begins challenging Ancient Eight competition next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two athletes on the podium, and one Olympic gold medalist defeated—so much for a week off.
While Harvard did not compete in a collegiate carnival this weekend, the Crimson Nordic team stayed just as busy yesterday at the TD Bank Eastern Cup races at Weston Ski Track.
The team competed in a morning 1.5k sprint and a longer afternoon race—5k for the women and 10k for the men, both skate events.
Sophomore Alena Tofte and freshman Chris Stock both reached the podium in their respective events, and Harvard saw several other skiers post impressive finishes over the course of the day.
Stock got the team off to a fast start with his third-place finish in the morning’s 1.5k race.
“I usually struggle more with skate races,” Stock said. “I have had good skate races this year. I thought maybe I would be able to put something together.”
The Lincoln, Mass. native took advantage of his familiarity with the course—home for both the Crimson and Stock’s former high school.
“I’ve skied it all my life,” he said. “I was feeling really quick and powerful today...my goal was to be on the podium, to wear the Harvard jacket on the podium. I was pretty psyched.”
Just behind Stock was sophomore Tony Ryerson, who finished seventh, but Stock was quick to laud his female counterparts.
“I think the girls were the real success of the day,” he said. “They were way up there...Our women have been skiing really well recently. Coming off Alena’s top-10 finish, I think, in some ways this is unsurprising, but it’s still a great result.”
The Crimson’s top female Nordic skier all season, Tofte again led the way in the morning’s 1.5k race, placing fourth. Freshman Jen Rolfes placed sixth in the event.
“I just went into it thinking that I’d do my best,” Tofte said of her morning race. “It ended up working out pretty well...I felt strong out on the flats.”
But Tofte’s best performance came in the afternoon, when she finished second in the 5k race. The afternoon racing differed from the morning racing in that all the racers started at the same time.
“We got to kind of jockey around,” Tofte said. “It was a nice change from just individual starts. I led for a while...I ended up sprinting ahead of the third-place woman. I felt really good. I felt strong. I’m excited for the rest of the season.”
The third-place finisher was former Russian Olympian Nina Gavrilyuk. Gavriluk won Olympic gold medals in the 4x5k in 1988, 1994, and 1998. Gavrilyuk also won a bronze medal in the 15k in the 1994 Lillehammer games.
“I found out about it afterwards,” Tofte said of beating Gavrilyuk. “It’s exciting to know that.”
Meanwhile, Rolfes placed sixth. With her two top-10 finishes on Sunday as well as her strong effort in last weekend’s relay, Rolfes has recently started to hit her stride as a top skier.
“We were trading positions a lot,” Tofte said of racing with Rolfes. “We got to ski together some. I skied against her in high school, and I’ve known her for a while. Jen had a great day. She’s an awesome spring racer, and she had a wonderful weekend. I think she’s probably really excited about how she did today.”
“That was probably Jen’s best day of racing,” Harvard coach Chris City ‘94 added.
City also noted that Rolfes bettered her chances of qualifying for the Junior Olympics with her performance on Sunday. Stock and Tofte have likely qualified, though they would not compete if they qualified for the NCAA Championships.
“Alena Tofte and Jen Rolfes skied awesome races this afternoon,” Ryerson said. “I was proud of them.”
With a successful weekend behind it, Harvard now turns it sights back to the collegiate carnival circuit. The Crimson heads to Stowe, Vt., next weekend to compete at the University of Vermont Winter Carnival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team split its pair of games this weekend, dropping its season opener at the Murr Center to a strong Northwestern team (3-0) on Friday, 6-1, then bouncing back to defeat Purdue (1-2) by a score of 5-2. The Crimson (1-1) was fueled by strong performances by its doubles duo of junior Jonathan Pearlman and freshman Casey MacMaster, who went undefeated this weekend.
HARVARD 5, PURDUE 2
The Crimson made some adjustments to its lineup and bounced back from the previous day’s loss to defeat Boilermakers on Saturday by a score of 5-2. “It was just the small things,” Tchan said of the change, “Just being more ready, more alert, and more focused.”
In contrast to its first contest, Harvard dominated from the beginning, sweeping all three doubles matches to earn a 1-0 lead.
“They were a younger team,” said Crimson coach Dave Fish about Purdue’s doubles. “The players were not as well trained in their doubles, and we jumped on them.”
In the singles matches, the home team took down Purdue in the No. 1, 3, 4, and 6 spots. Senior Alexei Chijoff-Evans shook off a narrow loss the day before to thoroughly dominate his Purdue opponent—senior Eric Ramos—winning in straight sets with a combination of strong serves and accurate down-the-line backhands. Pearlman and senior Aba Omodele-Lucien also continued their solid performances by winning singles matches.
“[Alexei] got his first win in some time,” Fish said, “and Aba and Pearlman continued their leadership on the court.”
Despite a tremendous amount of effort on both players’ parts, sophomore Joshua Tchan and junior Alistair Felton lost tough matches that ended in tiebreakers.
“[Felton’s] match was so much fun to watch,” Fish said. “Alistair has just gotten better and better competitively.”
“I started off really slowly,” Tchan said. “My opponent played well in the beginning, and I was playing catch up the entire game. Some shots got lucky, and unfortunately, I didn’t get my way.”
No. 59 NORTHWESTERN 6, HARVARD 1
Harvard came out sluggish against a very strong Wildcats team, ranked No. 59 in the nation. From the very beginning, Northwestern’s doubles dominated the court, winning two out of three sets to take the 1-0 lead.
“They were well-coached,” Fish said. “Their doubles jumped on us every fast. They came on very strong…they got breaks on all three of our teams, and we were playing catch up.”
Although each match was very close, Pearlman and MacMaster were the only victors for the Crimson in the doubles, as they defeated the Wildcats’ Eric Spector and Chris Jackman, 8-5.
The duo of Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen fell to Northwestern’s Joshua Graves and Spencer Wolf, 8-5. Finally, Omodele-Lucien and Tchan lost to the Wildcats’ Tobias Reitz and Andrew McCarthy, 8-6.
“They just were able to run harder than we were,” Fish said. “Although we played with them, we couldn’t play past them.”
“In the beginning of the doubles, we were caught off guard a little bit,” Tchan added. “It took us a while to get adjusted…Everyone was just trying to find their ground on the courts.”
Northwestern expanded the lead in the singles, sweeping all but No. 5 singles to win by a final score of 6-1. Omodele-Lucien was the only winner for Harvard, as he defeated freshman Raleigh Smith, 7-6, 7-6. Despite finding himself down, 4-0, in the first set, Omdoele-Lucien stormed back, breaking Smith three times and eventually winning the set in a tiebreaker. He carried his momentum into the second set, and in a match that went down to the wire, Omdoele-Lucien managed to pull out a tough victory in another tiebreaker.
Pearlman, who dropped his first set to Graves, 6-3, before storming back to take the second set, 7-5, lost in a lengthy 10-6 tiebreaker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first two contests after the team’s matchup against Trinity was postponed due to inclement weather, the No. 6 Harvard men’s squash team (6-2, 2-1 Ivy) has reached the .500 mark in road games for the first time this season, thanks to two solid wins against Hamilton and St. Lawrence.
“We wouldn’t classify [this weekend’s contests] as our tougher matches, but they were two solid performances,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “We were expected to beat [the Continentals and the Saints], but you still have to get the job done.”
HARVARD 9, HAMILTON 0
Harvard capped off a strong weekend Saturday afternoon with a sweep of No. 21 Hamilton (2-10-0, 0-1 Liberty League) at the Continentals’ Little Squash Center.
“The main thing for this weekend was to keep up our concentration and intensity, because we were playing teams that were quite a bit weaker than us,” freshman Gary Power said.
A lack of home-court advantage was clearly not an issue for the Crimson this weekend, as every player in a Harvard jersey won his respective match by a score of 3-0. The Crimson cruised to its second 9-0 win of the weekend without suffering a single loss.
“To be honest, I think this past week wasn’t too much of a test for us,” Power said. “The main thing was to keep up our intensity levels after traveling. We had to drive eight hours and be ready to play, which definitely helped us prepare [for our next matches].”
Playing in the second position for Harvard for just the second time this season, captain Reed Endresen led the Crimson, dismantling his opponent by an aggregate score of 33-11, including an 11-1 win in the third set.
“Overall, I think our captain [deserves recognition],” Way said. “He has not just stepped up and shown himself to be a very good leader [off the court]. He was playing at No. 5 and he’s now playing at No. 2 on the team. He’s been showing a lot of leadership qualities as a player.”
Power also continued his winning ways over Hamilton’s top athlete. The freshman—who is currently the nation’s 10th-ranked player—took down Continentals freshman Martin Bawden in three tight sets.
The strong overall victory for Harvard included two 11-0 sets, with sophomores Alexander Ma and Jason Micas picking up perfect games for the Crimson at the No. 8 and No. 10 spots, respectively.
Though Harvard has yet to lose a match at Barnaby Courts, the Crimson now sits at 2-2 on the road.
HARVARD 9, ST. LAWRENCE 0
Harvard began this weekend’s road trip on Friday with No. 14 St. Lawrence (9-5, 2-1 Liberty League). The Crimson swept eight of its nine individual matches of the day in three sets, with the Saints picking up just one set—coming at the No. 5 individual spot.
“St. Lawrence had a big crowd,” Power said. “It was really important for us to concentrate in that type of situation, to be able to handle a crowd against us.”
In what was perhaps the most strongly contested individual matchup of the weekend, freshman Nigel Koh came back after losing his first set, 11-8, with three dominating games, including an 11-1 victory in the third set.
Freshman Brandon McLaughlin, classmate Thomas Mullaney, and sophomore Zeke Scherl won three more challenging matches, coming out on top of their respective opponents after one 12-10 match each.
“On the St. Lawrence team, the top three positions are very stong,” Way said. “Our top three players really had to step up and they did.”
Harvard’s current top three—Power, Endresen, and senior Richard Hill—went 18-0 in sets this weekend.
“[Our players] did what they had to do,” Way said. “It’s one of those situations where you rank above the other teams, and you’re expected to win. You just have to make sure you don’t get complacent, and we didn’t. You have to have a business-like approach; they had that approach and did us proud in every way.”
Though the Crimson trained through January, Harvard has played just one other contest in 2011 so far, earning an 8-1 victory over No. 8 Western Ontario two weeks ago. Though not the tightest matches, this weekend’s contests provide the Crimson with some more experience on the road, as Harvard proceeds into a difficult stretch of its season.
“The cancelled game [against the Bantams] didn’t really affect our game plan,” Power said. “We played challenge matches instead, so we were still ready to go. We have a very busy next couple of days, with four teams in eight days, and they’re all tough teams...we’ll be ready for those.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Against strong competition, the Crimson women’s tennis team was unable to pull out a victory this weekend in the ITA Division I Kickoff Weekend. Four top-50 squads met in Evanston, Ill., to take part in the event, which was held this weekend in 15 sites nationwide. No. 44 Harvard (1-2) lost to No. 20 Northwestern (1-2), 5-0, on Saturday and fell a match short yesterday against No. 38 Boise State (3-1).
“Overall, I thought they got some good matches and good experience,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “The most important thing we take away from this weekend is that we got tougher and more experienced.”
NO. 38 BOISE STATE 4, HARVARD 3
The Broncos, fresh off a 5-2 loss to No. 34 Nebraska (1-0) on Saturday, played well against Harvard yesterday in a contest featuring two closely matched squads.
“We had our chances and we could have won, but a couple of matches didn’t go our way,” junior co-captain Holly Cao said.
Harvard opened the match by losing the doubles point for the third consecutive match this season. On the No. 3 court, freshman Hannah Morrill and sophomore Kristin Norton gave Boise State its first match with an 8-5 loss.
“In doubles, we got some slow starts and really couldn’t recover,” Green said.
Cao and Samantha Rosekrans, Harvard’s other co-captain, tied the doubles score with a win on the No. 1 court, 8-6.
“It was a very close match. But we stayed tough and ultimately we were able to close it out,” Cao said.
Next to them, freshman Natalie Blosser and sophomore Hideko Tachibana were edged out of a win, falling, 8-6, giving the Broncos a 1-0 advantage moving into singles.
In singles, No. 46 Cao didn’t lose a game in either set against Boise State’s Lauren Megale to even up the score.
“Holly was really on fire in singles,” Green said. “She’s a really special player for us. She came out on fire and pretty much ran through her opponent.”
But the Broncos took the upper hand for a second time when Blosser lost to Marlena Pietzuch, 6-0, 6-1.
Boise State then moved within a point of clinching with Morgan Basil’s 6-1, 6-3 victory over Morrill.
Norton kept Harvard’s hopes alive with a 6-3, 6-2 win on the No 3 court.
“She really rebounded from her match against Northwestern,” Green said. “She took it upon herself to get the job done on her court today.”
The Broncos clinched the match when Samantha Gridley lost to Elyse Edwards on the No. 5 court, 6-1, 7-5.
Despite the team loss, Tachibana kept fighting against Sonia Klamczynska on the No. 2 court until she earned herself a 7-6, 6-4 win.
“[Tachibana] is really stepping up and becoming a leader on our team,” Green said. “She’s becoming more vocal and working not only on encouraging her teammates but also holding them accountable.”
NO. 20 NORTHWESTERN 5, HARVARD 0
On Saturday, the Crimson squared off against a Northwestern squad featuring four of the 125 top women in the ITA rankings. Despite its effort, the team could not earn a point.
“We really respect them as opponents,” Green said. “Northwestern just competed much better than we did. We need to find a way to win next time.”
In doubles, on the No. 3 court, Morrill and Norton lost two late service games to fall, 8-5. Cao and Rosekrans also fell, 8-5, on No. 1 court to the Wildcats’ No. 30 duo of Linda Abu Mushrefova and Nida Hamilton, while Blosser and Tachibana could not fight their way back from an early deficit and lost, 8-4.
To begin singles play, Northwestern’s No. 76 Belinda Niu recorded a 6-1, 6-0 win against Norton at No. 3, while Stacey Lee outplayed Gridley to give Northwestern its third point with a 6-3, 6-2 score on the No. 6 court. The Wildcats clinched the match on at No. 4 when Rosekrans fell to No. 120 Kate Turvy, 6-3, 6-4. Afterward, Tachibana fell to No. 66 Brittany Wowchuk at No. 2, 6-4, 6-2.
Cao’s No. 1 singles match against No. 52 Maria Mosolova went unfinished due to Northwestern’s clinching the match, despite Cao’s 7-5 first set victory, and her 4-2 lead in the second. Cao lost to Masolova in three sets last May in the opening round of the NCAA Division I Women’s Tennis Singles Championship.
“I was really happy with the way I played,” Cao said. “I executed my game plan. It was a very high quality match.”
“Holly was in control, but unfortunately she didn’t get to finish,” Green said.
At No. 5, Blosser’s match went unfinished as well, though she had been poised to even up the set score, holding a 5-4 lead in the second set after dropping the first 7-6 (2).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a Saturday full of lifetime bests and ECAC and IC4A qualifying marks, the Harvard track and field team continues to gather momentum as it approaches its indoor championship season.
Members of the Crimson traveled to take part in three different competitions, as the squad focused on tuning up individual performances. While the throwers made the trip to Maine to compete at Bowdoin College, the rest of the squad stayed closer to home. Several distance runners went across the river to participate in the Terrier Invitational at Boston University, and the pentathletes and heptathletes remained on campus to contend in the Harvard Multi-Meet.
“This weekend was more about trying to work on different things with each event group that we need to practice for the competitions coming up,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I was overall very pleased with how the student-athletes performed. We got some great marks in, and we put in some good work today.”
TERRIER INVITATIONAL
The Crimson rose to the occasion against some tough competition at the Terrier Invitational, coming back to campus with three lifetime bests and two post-season qualifying times between four athletes.
In the one mile, junior Michael Hoffman took the lead of his heat with 400 meters to go and held off the rest of the competition before crossing the finish line. His effort was good for a lifetime best and IC4A qualifying time of 4:14.67, placing 26th in the 125-runner field.
Freshman James Leakos and sophomore Stewart Richardson both had lifetime bests in the 3K. They took 31st and 34th, respectively, with times of 8:40.04 and 8:42.44. Richardson also took the lead of his heat in a close finish, pulling in front with about 600 meters to go.
On the women’s side, junior Kailyn Kuzmuk qualified for the ECACs in the 5K, crossing the finish line in 17:13.90.
“It’s a great feeling [to see these athletes get their lifetime bests and qualifying marks],” Saretsky said. “It is a testament to the hard work they’ve put in—especially over January, but also in the fall. I think it bodes well for the entire team as we move into the next stage in our season.”
“It’s a really exciting time of year, and we had a couple of really good lifetime bests and postseason qualifying marks this weekend,” co-captain Brian Hill said. “It’s a good confidence booster heading into some big meets.”
BOWDOIN
Although the Crimson throwers did not compete for places against Bowdoin and Colby, they had some solid performances at the contest on Saturday.
In the men’s weight throw, four Harvard competitors posted the top marks of the field. Senior Ablorde Ashigbi threw an IC4A qualifying mark of 17.73 meters, surpassing all of his competition by over a full meter.
“Almost every throw that Ashigbi does now would qualify him for the IC4A,” Hill said. “He is a great competitor.”
Freshman Dustin Brode, senior Eric Clayman, and sophomore Matthew Polega followed Ashigbi in the event with marks of 16.41, 16.26, and 15.41 meters, respectively.
In the women’s weight throw, the Crimson surpassed its competition, as freshman Adabelle Ekechukwu posted a mark of 15.29 meters and sophomore Chelsea Gilbert recorded a throw of 13.53 meters.
Freshman Alysha Johnson and sophomore Shannon Watt continued to post top results for Harvard in the shot put with marks of 12.89 and 12.26 meters, respectively.
HARVARD MULTI-MEET
The multi-event athletes continued Harvard’s strong marks for the day in their home competition as juniors Christine Reed and Nicole Sliva and sophomore Mary Hirst secured fifth, seventh, and eighth-place finishes for the Crimson in the pentathlon.
Reed took home three bronzes in the 800-meter run, 60-meter hurdles, and the long jump, while Sliva took the silver in the 800-meter run and fifth in the shot put. Hirst also secured a pair of second-place finishes for Harvard in the high jump and the shot put.
On the men’s side, junior Jacques Barjon placed 10th in overall points in the heptathlon, with his strongest results being a fourth-place finish in the 60-meter dash and a pair of sixth-place finishes in the long jump and the shot put.
“We are definitely taking a lot of confidence from the early season, which is great heading into some of the championship meets,” Hill said. “It’s a lot of fun to see your fellow competitors doing well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a highly anticipated weekend, Harvard men’s basketball did exactly what it needed to do, riding to victories over Columbia and Cornell by an average margin of 16 points. In doing so, the Crimson has run it winning streak to eight games and remains atop the Ivy League standings with a 4-0 conference record.
But the Crimson wasn’t the only squad that made a splash over the weekend. In fact, each of the Ancient Eight's clubs played on both Friday and Saturday. And after the dust settled, three teams are undefeated in league play: Harvard and perennial Ivy League powerhouses Penn (8-8, 2-0 Ivy) and Princeton (14-4, 2-0).
In its league opener Friday night, the Quakers faced off against Yale (9-9, 2-2) at home. After scoring 24 of the game’s first 30 points, Penn was in command and never relinquished the lead, holding on to beat the Bulldogs 66-58. The following night, the Quakers met up with a weak Brown squad (7-11, 0-4). Not able to finish the job in regulation, Penn squeaked out a win in OT, 80-78.
Princeton also played host to Brown and Yale in its league-opening games. The Tigers started the weekend on a strong foot, coasting to an easy 78-60 win over the Bears.  Princeton continued its solid play in the early going the next day against Yale, at one time up by 13 points. But the Bulldogs made it interesting, narrowing the difference to one point with only 90 seconds left before the Tigers regained the upper hand, eventually taking it 67-63.
For all three teams, the real tests begin next weekend, as Princeton and Penn host Harvard on Friday and Saturday nights, respectively. By this time next week, we’ll have at least one fewer undefeated team and a better idea of who will take the Ivy League crown.

Shopping week is finally over, but you, like many other Harvard students, might realize that you've exceeded your budget during a frenzied shopping period of overindulgence. In an effort to get you back on solid financial footing, we've compiled a list of great on-campus and local jobs. To view the job listings, you'll need to register with the Student Employment Office.
Babysitting
 
Who doesn't love babies? There are plenty of babysitting jobs floating around and many pay as much as $15 per hour. As many of these jobs are posted on the Student Employment Office's website the day they're needed, be sure to check diligently if you're interested.
Government Documents Assistant
 
Widener needs someone who "can lift heavy objects" to help maintain the government stacks in the library. Apparently, once you've trained for this four to six week job, you can even wear headphones while you work!
Dorm Crew Inspections
 
There are dorm crew jobs that require you to clean bathrooms, and there are dorm crew jobs that simply require walking around and performing safety inspections. If the ease of this work isn't incentive enough, you get paid $11.80 per hour for about two hours of work a week.
Faculty Club Waiter
 
If you were too busy during shopping period to find time to suck up to all your new professors, don't fear! You can get to know them as a "Food and Beverage Server" at the Faculty Club! If you take one of these jobs, paying $12 an hour for up to 20 hours a week, you might want to start asking your economics professor for investing advice.
Mystery shopper
 
This job has the best name, hands down. Now, imagine if you got to go around shopping and rating stores? Sounds cool? Yeah, we think so too. We'd even do it for free instead of the $10 - $20 (plus reimbursement) being offered.
Unlike classes, there's no ceiling on the number of part-time jobs you can take, but you should send applications in soon as vacancies tend to fill up quickly!
