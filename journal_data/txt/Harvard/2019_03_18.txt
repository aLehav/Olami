After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of its 211th season, the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra performed for a sea of visiting parents at the Junior Family Weekend Concert on March 2 in Sanders Theatre. Featuring Haydn’s penultimate symphony and a particularly stunning rendition of Sibelius’s third symphony, the performance was well-balanced and powerful.
The orchestra highlighted the sprightly stylistic and structural innovations of Jean Sibelius’s Symphony No. 3 in C major, Op. 52, including dramatic passages of austere chaos that contrasted with moments of full euphony. In the first movement, Allegro moderato in C major, the cellos and contra basses provided a strident, rhythmic melody. The woodwind solo over the brushing strings was bucolic and jostling. Plagal cadences, underscored by the timpani, strongly advanced the movement’s growing contrapuntal and apocalyptic tension.
After the pulsing, folkloric nocturne in the second movement roared the breathtaking last movement in Moderato, which Sibelius once described as "the crystallisation of ideas from chaos." The sonorous blare of the trombones, along with rough strokes and rubbery pizzicatos of the strings, blended discordant melodies as if ravaging them with hurricane and anarchy. Welded beautifully, waltzing in and out of the pervasive darkness, the orchestra marched in a compendium of the chorale theme towards the piece’s purposefully anticlimactic end.
The orchestra also performed Joseph Haydn’s penultimate Symphony No. 103 in E-flat Major, Hob I: 103 (“The Drumroll”), which staggered in its onset but technically sharpened as the piece progressed. The evening began with an imposing, deep-resonating rendering of the eponymous kettledrum cadenza. Undernourished and lacking character, the bassoons, cellos, and double basses were off to a rocky start with slips and tangles in the sepulchral, medieval-like “Dies irae” introduction, but the violins’ precise articulation made up for the other strings’ difficulties. The first violins in particular, led by Principal Jeremiah L. Blacklow ’20 and Assistant Principal Cherin Lee ’22, performed with a robust intensity, with every sinewy texture crisply defined. After the vivacious Allegro con spirito first theme, an uplifting Ländler-ish sweet pastoral theme glowed with resonance. The opening drum roll’s fanfares returned, and the movement concluded somberly.
The menacing Croatian-folk military variation of the second movement, with the charming woodwinds answered by the strings, began with a drooping, imperious march. Aside from some intonation mistakes, stressful blunders, and rushed residue in the concertmaster’s supposed-to-be florid first violin solo in the third variation, the movement was beautifully integrated. Following the lovely trio section, which featured a graceful arabesque for clarinets in the swaggering Menuetto, the finale in agile rondo began with a shaky traditional French horn call, which extended with different parts blending in a relentless unity, gracefully lilting in a waltz, evincing unassuming calmness, eventually culminating in a sparkling, triumphant close.
For the first time this season, the event was entirely student-run. Conductors Gordon V. Ma ’19 and Reuben A. Stern ’20 led with stirring enthusiasm. HRO’s performance proved to be a delightful highlight of Junior Family Weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard men’s basketball, the scene was all too familiar.
As the cheers in Payne Whitney Gymnasium rose to a deafening roar, and the game slipped away, the Crimson could do nothing but watch their hopes of reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015 evaporate into a cloud of could-have beens.
For the second straight year, Harvard was the regular season champion and number one seed of the Ivy League forced to play on the road, falling to Yale by a 97-85 score, the hosts of this year’s tournament. A year after losing to second-seeded Penn in Philadelphia in the finals, Sunday’s championship game offered an opportunity to exorcise last season’s demons, but the Crimson were unable to overcome the Bulldogs’ offensive juggernaut and raucous home court environment.
“Certainly [Yale] played at a much higher level here this afternoon, they are very deserving of the victory and to representing our conference in the NCAA Tournament,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we played exceptionally well in spurts. In order to win a game like this, we need forty minutes of outstanding basketball. We didn’t have that today.”
Even 38 points from junior guard Bryce Aiken wasn’t enough to keep Harvard in the game, as Yale came with wave after wave of offense. The Randolph, N.J., native finished 11-of-21 from the field, and was the most lethal player on the court, but was unable to rally his team to victory in a hostile road environment.
After a slam-dunk from freshman guard Noah Kirkwood gave the Crimson a 52-45 lead and breathing room, the Bulldogs responded with an extended 28-7 run to give them firm control over the came.
“We didn’t defend well, that was ultimately what it came down to,” Aiken said. “We let them get a lot of easy shots, and allowed them to go on a run and they capitalized on it.”
The big run was just another part of the deja vu that plagued Harvard in the championship. A year after the Quakers rattled off a similar stretch during last season’s finals, Yale did their most impressive work without the Ivy League player of the year.
With Miye Oni picking up his fourth foul of the game with just over 14 minutes in the game, he was forced to go to the bench. With the Crimson leading 54-53 at that point, everything seemed in place for the five-point underdogs to pull off the road upset and punch their ticket to the Big Dance.
“My initial reaction [to the Oni foul] was bad call,” said Yale senior guard Alex Copeland, “My second reaction was I looked at the clock and I looked at the rest of the guys on the court, I said, we need to do it without him and we need to hold it down until he could get back into the game. We played so hard. ”
Instead, the Bulldogs rode an impressive showing from Copeland, and clutch play off the bench from sophomore guard Azar Swain, to sweep away the top-seeded Harvard bunch. Copeland poured in bucket after bucket, as Amaker desperately tried to contain the savvy veteran with a mixture of Kale Catchings, Justin Bassey, and Rio Haskett, but was ultimately unable to.
The Los Angeles, Calif., native led Yale with 25 points, on an ultra-efficient 9-of-14 from the field, tacking on seven free throws and a game-high seven assists. Even with Oni anchored to the bench, Copeland was able to facilitate offense through Swain, and senior Blake Reynolds, who finished with 15 and 14 points respectively.
“A couple of times I tried to slow [Copeland] down, much to no avail,” Yale Coach James Jones said. “He just drove right past me and right pass anyone in front of him to get to his spot and pull up [for] a jump shot, and he gets people so off-balance. And with that he attracts so much attention, so he’s able to find guys and make them better.”
Ultimately, the Bulldogs’ shooting in their home gym proved simply too much to overcome. Yale finished the game shooting at over a 60 percent clip, and knocked down 22-of-24 free throws, good enough for 92 percent. The Bulldogs took care of the ball as well, commiting just seven turnovers, ensuring that Harvard couldn’t climb back into the game.
Although Aiken’s heroics were the brightest spot of the Crimson’s afternoon, Kirkwood also played terrifically in the biggest game of his young career. The Ottawa, Ontario., native drilled several triples to keep Harvard in the game as Yale started to pull away.
The Ivy League Rookie of the year knocked down 3-of-5 from beyond the arc, finishing with 19 points, as the only player other than Aiken to record double figures. The Bulldogs struggled to contain Kirkwood’s explosive scoring, frequently throwing double teams at the freshman and Aiken.
For a second straight season, the Crimson must accept the harsh realities of how difficult it is to win on the road in the Ivy League. Harvard was tasked with beating co-champions Yale for a third team this season, and a second time at Payne Whitney Gymnasium, but were unable to finish the job.
Ultimately, the Crimson must accept its automatic bid to the NIT as a small consolation prize, with the knowledge that the 2020 Ivy League Tournament will be played at Lavietes Pavilion in Cambridge. On a Sunday afternoon filled with hope of a trip to March Madness, the most exciting stage in college basketball, the pain of last season has once again resurfaced.
Despite these small silver linings, when the final horn expired at Payne Whitney, Aiken and Harvard were left with nothing but frustration at coming up painfully short, for a second straight year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So now what?
Harvard men’s basketball had to walk in the midst of another program’s confetti for the second-straight season, still chasing the now-elusive Ivy tournament trophy. At the doorstep of the Big Dance, it is back to the drawing boards once again.
Last year’s tournament loss to Penn added a permanent scar in the minds of the returning players, one that was alluded to throughout this six-month, long-haul of a season. To have to experience the same disappointment and be denied once again of this opportunity must sting even stronger for this Crimson team.
Will the fourth time at the tournament finally be the charm?
To even think about that and not acknowledge the grueling, exhilarating season this one has been would simply be a disservice. A college basketball season, compounded by the off-court demands of the Ivy League, is already one that is stress-inducing enough.
But my goodness, was this campaign for Harvard one to remember.
Through all the last-second thrillers, Bryce Aiken buzzer-beaters, and heart-throbbing finishes, the end of the trip to March Madness for the Crimson seemed a bit too premature. The team was just celebrating its seventh Ivy title in the past decade one week ago in Morningside Heights — and now must digest the unappetizing medicine of heartbreak. It has one more opportunity to cap of the season as an auto-bid to the National Invitational Tournament(NIT), but this loss on Sunday afternoon will inevitably linger until next March.
And frankly, the culminating showcase for the Ivy League deserved another last-minute dogfight whose victors would not be decidedly crowned until the final ticks of the clock.
But the Crimson was simply inundated by an insuperable Bulldogs offensive wave in the second half, spurred frankly by the unlikeliest of circumstances: the benching of Yale’s “MVP” Miye Oni, who had picked up his fourth foul less than six minutes into the second frame.
After that foul, it’s no understatement to say a few in Crimson could taste it. Even with the imposing cast of offensive weapons Yale possessed, how could the Bulldogs edge its way back with its best player seated behind his head coach?
But Yale just kept scoring. And scoring. And scoring. All in all, it was a 26-7 run on the stat sheet.
The game had gotten out of grasp, and not even some late heroics from Bryce (who notched a tournament-record 38 points) could nudge the uber-confident Bulldogs side — who reciprocated with points every time the Crimson even dared cut it within single digits.

What adds to the legacy of this season, is again, the fact that Harvard was on the doorstep of achieving its season goals even without star player Seth Towns. The late emergence of freshmen Kale Catchings and Mason Forbes alongside a blossoming Ancient Eight cornerstone in Noah Kirkwood bolsters an already deep squad.
Aiken proved his next-level abilities for all who may have doubted his ability to bounce back from knee surgery. Noticeable progress was made by key contributors such as sophomores Danilo Djuricic and Rio Haskett, while those such as juniors Justin Bassey and Christian Juzang continued to prove their worth in a multitude of capacities from on-court leadership to defensive acuity. The team showed an ideal mix of veteran experience and youthful energy.
To earn that seventh title is no feat to be ashamed of as well. Outside of the freshmen, the rest of the team will get its second straight ring and returns nearly all of its current scoring, alongside reinforcements headlined by Massachusetts Player of the Year Chris Ledlum.
The talent is undeniable for any squad assembled by Tommy Amaker, but as the gap continues to close within the Ivy League — as was well-and-apparent this season as the likes of Brown and Cornell made leaps forward — Harvard must do even more to once again lead the pack in the Ivy League.
And if one is to consider the current junior class as carving out an era in Amaker’s time at Harvard, the heartbreak of losing out on an NCAA Tournament bid three times means that this upcoming team will be hungrier and psychologically prepared as ever to see its turn at glory.
This may be exactly the takeaway. Amaker has preached sacrifice this season as the central motto, asking his team to embrace the “next play” mentality, on and off the court. Patience and discipline, from the outside observer’s eye, seems to be the underlying component of that message.
Thus, it is perhaps written in stone that this process will pay dividends only in Year Four for these juniors. The prior three teams have seen its fair share of accomplishments, both team-wise and individual. But the final coveted prize, a berth in the NCAA Tournament, demands an equally coveted degree of patience.
‘Til next March we await.
