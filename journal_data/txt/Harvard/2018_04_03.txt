After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his memoir, “The Sun Does Shine,” Anthony Ray Hinton, a black man from rural Alabama who has been put on death row for crimes he did not commit, finds his most important source of strength in Scripture. After the 1985 robberies and murders of two fast food restaurant managers and the attempted murder of a third, Hinton himself becomes a victim—not of a serial killer on the loose, but of the criminal justice system in America which decides that he is guilty of these charges. Considering the fact that he was working as a custodian 15 miles away from where he allegedly tried to shoot a man in the head, the accusation is absurd. He “pray[s] for God to reveal the truth” knowing that it will be the ultimate source of liberation for him, citing John 8:32: “Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” Ultimately, however, Hinton finds that freedom from truth alone is difficult to achieve. Hinton’s solid voice in “The Sun Does Shine” gives the memoir a push-and-pull feel, mirroring the constant setbacks and advances on his road to liberation.
Born in 1955, Hinton comes of age at a turbulent time in American society, and his erudite depiction of what he remembers of his daily life in rural Alabama is both insightful and aggravating. He details growing up in the shadows of the Civil Rights movement, alluding to high-profile turning points like the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham and the jailing of Martin Luther King, Jr. Alongside these historical moments are more personal scenes too small to have garnered as much attention, from the day-to-day reality of segregation in the South to the bombings of people’s houses. “People living on Dynamite hill [had] to hide in their bathtubs because bombs were being thrown into their houses,” he writes at one point.
By detailing the extent to which racism plays a role in his daily life, Hinton foreshadows the attitudes that will ultimately ensure his indictment. When he first arrives at the police station, officers immediately tell him that conviction is inevitable and give him five reasons why, starting with: “Number one, you’re black.” Hinton’s race, coupled with Hinton’s old enemy’s thirst for vengeance and a “constitutionally deficient” defense lawyer, is the chief reason he finds himself on death row. Hinton’s first-person account rings louder than a newspaper retelling his story. His narration imparts a valuable understanding of just how strongly racism is tied to America’s criminal justice institutions, more so than any retelling of the circumstances of his conviction ever could.
Nonetheless, Hinton finds the strength to not only survive while in prison, but to actively resist the institutional racism that has put him there in what is the most compelling aspect of the memoir: Time and time again, even after his motions for appeals fail and with no good lawyer in sight, Hinton refuses to be a victim. He seeks to fulfill the promise he repeatedly makes to his mother of a prompt homecoming. While in prison, Hinton even starts a book club, feeling like “someone had brought in contraband” since it is so forbidden. After more inadequate lawyers fail to free him from prison, however, Hinton meets “God’s best lawyer,” Bryan Stevenson from the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, who eventually helps pave the path to Hinton’s freedom after losing 30 years of life he will never get back. Hinton’s ability to speak about the injustices he faces with such poise and composure is his greatest gift. His ability to effectively articulate his infuriating experience in a level tone speaks to the character Hinton never let die.
Throughout the memoir, Hinton continuously questions the nature of his freedom: Does he ever truly attain it? Though everyone now knows the truth of his innocence, Hinton’s freedom has not come easily. By detailing his complicated relationship with the idea of it, Hinton shows the subjective nature of the word. When he works at the coal mine, “freedom” means being away from that “dark place” and standing in the sunshine. When he is in prison, Hinton finds “freedom” by daydreaming about adventures overseas and getting lost in works of fiction, if not in his fantasies about getting off death row. Now that he will no longer be executed, “freedom” once again means something different. Even though he sang “Thank God Almighty, I’m free at last” as he walked off the row, he admits that “I have my freedom, but in some ways, I am still locked down on the row.” The pervasive role that identity, memory, and loss play in his life forces him to take on a new struggle in the fight to fix America’s criminal justice system by abolishing the death penalty. For now, genuine freedom still has to wait.

Never heard of Helen, Georgia? It’s ok, neither has Earn. But that doesn’t stop Van from dragging her pseudo-boyfriend there for an Oktoberfest get-together. If last episode’s date night left you tenuously hoping for a reality in which Van and Earn ended up together, I’m sorry to break the bad news. What ensues in “Helen” are inevitably racist interactions, a much needed wakeup call for Van, and Earn acting like a bigger baby than his apparently invisible daughter (seriously, where is Lottie?).
This episode continues to borrow from the ghosts of its first season—Van’s friend Christina is the new Jayde from the sixth episode of Season One’s “Value,” and this episode’s disaster date is reminiscent of “Juneteenth”—but makes up for it by approaching them from different angles. Whereas Jayde made her opinions of Van clear, Christina’s biases are more implicit—until they’re not. When she introduces Van to her white friends, Van becomes “Lottie’s mom,” “Earn’s girl” who “used to be a teacher.” Van, she is not. Things come to a head when Van confronts Christina. “I don’t know why you have to introduce me as Lottie’s mom. You know my first name… And that’s not all that I’m gonna be for the rest of my life, is Lottie’s mom.” In one fell stroke, Van addresses how women and mothers are sometimes defined not in terms of who they are, but in terms of their relationships to others. Van is the most interesting character on the show (sorry, Darius, you can have coolest character), and the reduction of her character as the partner of Earn, who has done nothing but disappoint all season, and the mother of Lottie—whose absence from the show I’ve slowly started to realize is purposeful—cannot go unchallenged.
The episode goes on to further address black womanhood in the same conversation with Christina. “Like, I chose white. You chose black,” Christina says of their respective partners, before proceeding to define, this time, Van’s blackness. “You never hung out with me and Melanie when we invited you. And you only went to the black parties. I mean, it’s like you needed that black identity… You never invited me to your parties,” she lists. “That’s because, um, you always acted like you were better than us, and you would pander to us and say shit like, ‘I wish I had kinky hair.’” “Which you do. You just straighten it,” Van retorts. When Christina has the gall to get offended, Van is quick to point out her hypocrisy: “You literally just told me that I’m going to be a baby mama, and that’s ok because I ‘chose black.’” Coming from a fellow black woman, Christina’s words speak to one facet of the politics of black womanhood, in which black women are quick to pigeonhole their frenemies into stereotypes in order to make themselves feel superior.
“Helen” doesn’t just stop at Season One—it also takes from Jordan Peele’s Oscar-winning “Get Out.” Van and Earn leave Atlanta for the very white, suburban Helen, Ga. They nearly run over a pig on the way, only to dive into a culture in which “traditionally, there's a moor character that people show up in blackface.” And at the end of the day, the couple that came in together doesn’t leave together. But somehow, the show never feels like anything less than authentically “Atlanta.” When Earn wins a game of Hootz-Kutz by simply putting balls in a jug, everyone celebrates. As the festival comes to a close, flashing lights frame Van, a new German friend she’s made, and Earn, in a more rare, ethereal moment of cinematic—as opposed to narrative or anecdotal—genius. And when Earn says he’ll pick up Lottie from his mom’s house the next day, we nod along, because of course Lottie’s been with her grandma this whole time. The seamless coherence of these incongruous anecdotes is too consistent to be mere strokes of creative luck, but who cares?
“Get Ouuuuuut!”s

Many action and science fiction films get bogged down with romantic subplots and personal backstories that feel irrelevant compared to the thrills and chaos of the adventure. In stark contrast, “Ready Player One” is simply fun—and consciously so. While the film is lacking in some traditional measures of quality, “Ready Player One” sticks to its strengths—CGI and ’80s film nostalgia—delivering an experience that’s pure pleasure.
In 2045, a virtual reality video game known as “the OASIS” allows individuals to create their own perfect worlds. In this world, the virtual takes precedence over the real, and everyone’s main goal is to collect coins within the OASIS to the point where dying in the video game (and losing all of the coins accumulated) can push people to the brink of suicide in the real world. After the OASIS’s creator James Halliday (Mark Rylance) dies, he posthumously announces via video a challenge to find three keys, or Easter eggs, hidden within the game. The player who finds all three keys will gain control of the OASIS, now the most financially valuable asset on the planet. Protagonist Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), known within the game as Parzival, is a Gunter (“egg hunter”), one of many individuals attempting to find the keys and win the competition. Meanwhile, a rival corporation known as Innovative Online Industries (IOI), run by the slimy Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), is putting all of its resources into finding these Easter eggs in order to dominate the tech industry.
Spielberg shirks character development for a fast-paced plot and intense action, though surprisingly, not necessarily to the detriment of the film. When Wade suffers a personal loss, Spielberg elides depicting his grief on-screen. Rather, the plot moves immediately to the next task Wade must undertake to find the keys. The budding in-game romance between Wade and Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), a fellow Gunter, serves less as emotional payoff and more as a plot device to propel the action forward. Wade’s other friends from the OASIS, Aech (Lena Waithe), Sho (Philip Zhao), and Daito (Win Morisaki) similarly dwell very little on their personal backstories; their only purpose is to help Wade defeat IOI. The focus on plot and action over characters keeps the film highly entertaining, while avoiding the risk of over-sentimentality. In “Ready Player One,” the storyline matters more than the characters it affects so long as the pace and visuals deliver.
Stunning special effects, courtesy of production designer Adam Stockhausen, serve as the high-point of the movie. The first challenge to obtain a key, a virtual drag race, includes crazy explosions, swinging wrecking balls, a rampaging T-Rex, and a run-in with King Kong. The film’s CGI designers eschew realism to make it clear whether the characters are in the real or virtual world. The graphics also recreate pop-culture staples including the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Halo, the Iron Giant, and Chuckie. The nods to these cultural icons capture the lasting importance of quality entertainment, implying these titans will still be relevant 27 years in the future. The constant barrage of effects and visually-interesting environments more than make up for the aforementioned lack of character development and are reminders that “Ready Player One,” like a video game, is ultimately about constant fun.
The film focuses much more heavily on action, but it nevertheless retains its emotional core. “Ready Player One” taps into sentiments about childhood, specifically the joy of playing games with friends. When scenes switch between the game and the real world, it places the action in context: what feels like life-or-death within the OASIS is just a group of friends spending time together. The film makes a point of highlighting that the most fulfilling part of playing a game is just that—finding pleasure in the play even when it becomes competitive. “Ready Player One” commits to this simple joy throughout the film, a dedication that lends to its success.

“Out of Orbit,” a space-themed collaboration between the Harvard Ballet Company and the Harvard Pops Orchestra, claims to go where no space-ballet has gone before. Its ambition is astronomical, its (nep)tunes are stellar, and HBC’s gravity never eclipses Pops’ lightness. The show’s dancers and musicians are truly stars.
“Out of Orbit,” playing until April 7, marks an exciting collaboration between two prominent Harvard arts groups. In the show’s program, HBC co-directors Anna K. Antongiorgi ’19 and Mara G. Milner ’20 write, “Out of Orbit not only champions interdisciplinary work, it attempts to investigate a culture fascinated with the world beyond Earth.” It’s an ambitious astronomical investigation—and the groups pull it off with sparkly silver costumes and a whole lot of “Star Wars.” The result is a show that references the intergalactical while retaining a personal touch.
Unlike most smaller Harvard-affiliated performances, “Out of Orbit” is staged in the spacious Loeb Mainstage at the American Repertory Theater. The show makes use of its extra room with a simple, soothing set, and plenty of twinkling lights—the grayscale palette lets the artists define “space” however each song requires. Sometimes the backdrop reads as ethereal, while in other pieces it gains a spaceship vibe or a mechanical feel. To the designers’ credit, the set encompasses each mood with grace.
The performance itself involves exactly as much John Williams as a sci-fi fan might hope. The score of “Star Wars” isn’t a natural candidate to serve as the backdrop for a ballet, but “Out of Orbit” makes it work—five out of the 11 songs performed come straight from the movie franchise. Admittedly, John Williams’ deep love of the brass section can be rough on small orchestras (for reference, see the “Indiana Jones” or “Superman” themes), which Pops was not immune to in their Saturday show: At times, enthusiastic offbeats from the string section overpowered the brass’s melody. Regardless, the “Star Wars” motif is an engaging one—the songs are lively and fun, and they make for interesting balletic choreography.
“Out of Orbit” boasts an interesting variety of choreography styles. While all of the pieces are successful, a few stood out:  “The Sandpaper Ballet & Blue Tango” is charmingly upbeat, while “Star Wars”’ “The Imperial March” conveys an eerie but fitting sense of violence. “Clair de Lune” is intriguingly angular. The big-cast opening and finale both have an infectious air of excitement.
Pops, however, shines brightest in slightly different areas. Pianist Forrest Flesher is near-virtuosic in Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.” The entire ensemble comes together cleanly during the first “Jupiter” portion of a medley of Holst’s “The Planets.” While “Out of Orbit” is HBC’s main spring performance, the Pops are presenting a similar array of space-themed songs in April 15’s “Pops Spaces Out.” It makes sense, then, that their focus may have been channelled in slightly different directions.
According to the “Out of Orbit” program, Pops’ spring show will also feature David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”—which, quite honestly, answers a question I had throughout the program. Why did “Out of Orbit” use Elton John’s “Rocket Man” and not “Space Oddity,” or even R.E.M.’s “Man on the Moon”? Why choose “Also sprach Zarathustra,” from “2001: A Space Odyssey,” and not “The Blue Danube” from the same movie? “Out of Orbit” presents an interesting puzzle of orchestration. There are so many song options, so many different ways that space is featured in our cultural psyche—and so little time to portray them all.
The overwhelming amount of possible content, however, only emphasizes what a good theme “space” is for an orchestra and dance production. “Out of Orbit” offers a well-curated sample of its possible artistic choices: The show feels at times robotic and at times sentimental, occasionally violent and often dreamy. Both the dancers and the musicians bring an incredible diversity and enthusiasm to each piece. No matter the mood, “Out of Orbit” shoots for the stars—and more often than not, it lands there.

In a world of celebrity copycat beats and autotune, it often feels like artists are growing more and more detached from their work. In my 19 years of life I have attended many concerts, but none stood out to me like Born Ruffians’ did at the Sinclair on March 23. Composed of Luke Lalonde (guitar/vocals), Mitch DeRosier (bass), Andy Lloyd (guitar/keyboard) and Steve Hamelin (drums), Born Ruffians took the stage with a level of intensity and passion that I have never before seen. DeRosier bounced up and down the stage, his head bobbing wildly as he made faces at his often bearded and Warby-Parker-clad audience. Hamelin pounded the drums in a passionate fervor. Each of the band members concentrated intensely on their set as they all played together, performing with gleeful grins that rarely left their faces.
On tour for the release of their 2018 album “Uncle, Duke & the Chief,” the Canadian indie band performed in front of three giant lamps that lit the stage in various colors during their show. The stage’s front lighting often worked in tandem with these lamps to produce captivating color compositions, and, in homage to one of their albums, “Red, Yellow & Blue,” the lamps were often brightly lit up in primary colors. Multiple guitars also served as props on stage, and the artists switched between those guitars as the night went on.
The band Fleece, a psychedelic-indie-rock group, opened the concert. They played with an ease that seeped into the audience. Drummer Ethan Soil played every song with a huge grin on his face, drawing attention from fans enchanted by his blatant passion for his craft. Vocalists Matthew Rogers and Megan Ennenberg sang to each other and were visibly comfortable as they danced around onstage, shooting each other knowing smiles. Fleece did an excellent job of creating a relaxed yet engaging atmosphere, setting the tone for Born Ruffians’ entrance. The group wore casual evening wear—blazers atop long sleeve, button-down shirts and jeans. This quasi-formal uniform juxtaposed the band’s causal and uninhibited aura. Still, this formality was countered as the band romped around the stage with zeal.
Born Ruffians clearly connected with their audience, which seemed to be wholly immersed in the music. The band closed with “Working Together” off of “Uncle, Duke & the Chief.” Born Ruffians was joined onstage by Fleece and a videographer, so the stage filled with nine singers and dancers for the show’s conclusion. “Working Together” is a classic road-trip anthem, the type that one plays in a movie-perfect moment, surrounded by friends while heading to the beach. As both bands came together to perform the song, the love between the musicians on stage was obvious—the two drummers drummed on one set together, Fleece and Born Ruffians’ vocalists shared microphones and sang together, and to cap off the collaboration, a few tambourines and maracas entered the mix. It was a magically cohesive moment between musicians and audience. Visibly moved by the song, Hamelin eventually ceded control of his drum set to Fleece drummer Soil and leaped off of the stage into the crowd, then proceeded to dance with his starstruck fans until the song ended.
Born Ruffians’ show will not be forgotten by any of the audience members anytime soon—the cohesion, camaraderie, and passion in each one of the band members was palpable and translated into a connection between the audience and the musicians that permeated the entire show.

To the large group of lesbian friends residing in late 1990s Portland, “bisexual was the earnest white girl in your women’s studies class who had a nice boyfriend and wanted to clock in a little more oppression.” This is a problem for Andrea Morales, the heroine of Chelsey Johnson’s debut novel “Stray City,” because although Andrea identifies as a lesbian, she is pregnant. The result is heartwarming and sweet in a '90s grunge style, but Johnson doesn’t quite deliver the thought-provoking novel “Stray City” could have been.
The synopsis claims that Andrea’s pregnancy is a result of a post-breakup drunken rebound, implying that a one night stand is Andrea’s only sexual interaction with a man. However, the truth is that Andrea begins a nearly year-long love affair with Ryan Coates after she gets drunk to cope with her breakup, after which she gets pregnant. It takes 300 pages to properly build up and break down this relationship, leaving only 100 for Johnson to bring the child, Lucia, into the story 10 years later.
This digression from the promised plot is disappointing not for lack of interest or a hope for more focus on the mother-daughter narrative, but rather for what the novel could have been. By focusing on Andrea and Ryan’s relationship, Johnson has posited the opportunity to explore how the Portland lesbian community reacts to a lesbian sleeping with a man. Besides a few scenes that take place once the affair is made public, one in which a friend tells her to leave the community because there are “plenty of actual lesbians to carry on the...work,” there is not much by way of community reaction. Although Andrea’s lesbian support group is wary of girls who claim to be bisexual and are vehemently outraged at Andrea’s “betrayal” of her sexuality, the narrative skips over the process of acceptance. While it could have thoughtfully delved into the perceptions of sexuality and inquired about sexuality as a spectrum, “Stray City” doesn’t stray too far into this topic.
Even with this misleading synopsis, Johnson provides a heart-warming story that will, at the very least, drag up nostalgia for the 1990s. The characters are “scrappy girls in a borrowed room, [with] old couches, graffiti on the walls, a pile of snacks to scavenge, trading information and gossip as the air thickened with smoke.” They listen to everything from Nirvana to small local grunge bands, read magazines written by and about lesbians, go to bars, have lesbian art shows in abandoned buildings and sing ’90s songs on karaoke. A punk vibe resonates throughout the narrative that categorizes 1990s Portland all too well.
The most poignant part of the novel is saved for last, as Andrea spends the last 50 pages deciding how to explain her past to her daughter. Refreshingly, it is not Andrea’s same-sex attraction that confuses Lucia. Andrea’s relationship with another woman is natural to her daughter. But Andrea still has to explain why Lucia’s father isn’t around. Here, the deadbeat father narrative is twisted from its usual form into something different. [How could Ryan stick around if Andrea doesn’t even love him, or men at all? Does this fact, and Andrea’s claim that she doesn’t need his help, justify Ryan’s disappearance? It’s these question that pervade the entirety of the novel’s finale. This question takes a look at a family that is anything but nuclear, in today’s world there is a necessity for novels that inspect families that diverge from the heterosexual norm
An interesting spin on a single-parent narrative, “Stray City” explores some topics while leaving other timely ones high and dry. However, authors shouldn’t necessarily imbue their novels with political agendas just for the sake of it, and it’s okay if they don’t. In the end, Johnson provides a tale about finding oneself and one’s family in a setting that calls up memories of a cooler time.

With much anticipation, Harvard College admitted 1,962 applicants last week, bringing to us the thrill of knowing who our future classmates will be. We congratulate our successful soon-to-be peers for a job well done, and look forward to seeing you on campus this fall.
Harvard is so much more than a school: A Harvard acceptance is literally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Over the years, thousands of students have walked through the beautiful wrought iron of Johnston Gate and had deeply fulfilling experiences full of wonder, excitement, and promise. No one ever forgets the exact moment they received their Harvard acceptances—each a very different memory. Similarly, no one forgets the memories they create in their time here, as we make Harvard our own.
The opportunity to be a Harvard student is achieved with hard work, but also involves an extraordinary amount of luck. We urge our young peers to remember this, and take their acceptances with pride, as they well should, but also with grace and humility. Being humble isn’t just the right thing to do, both in your high schools and the communities in which you currently live, but it is a state of mind that prepares you for a lifetime of having gone to Harvard, with all the responsibilities and privileges it provides.
We also must never forget the power and importance of respect in our lives and the lives of others in the Harvard community. Harvard provides you the unparalleled opportunity to interact with and learn from people of completely different backgrounds and identities from around the world. Given this, we hope you choose to respect your classmates and peers on campus, and live your life with respectful thoughts and actions for them.
But most importantly, we hope you never forget where you are right now—to look around and fully realize the amazing nature of this moment, with all that lies ahead of you. Don’t merely overlook the last few weeks of high school with thoughts of the future—make the most of your senior year. All too often, we focus so much on our Harvard acceptances that we lose sight of enjoying the present. This is an incredibly unique moment in your life full of anticipation, excitement, and the promise of something new. Nevertheless, when you matriculate at college, enjoy that moment even more. Appreciate the ability to enjoy the close of one chapter of your life, and the sweet promise of beginning a new one.
We hope you have a well-deserved wonderful rest of your senior year, and again, we hope to see many of you at not only Visitas—the College’s visiting weekend—later this April, but also at the start of next year in September. We want you to share in the experiences we have had here—from the good, to the bad, to the once-in-a-lifetime.

“Love, Simon” is the straightest queer film I’ve ever seen.
The first time I saw the trailer in an actual movie theater, I was pleasantly surprised to see a mainstream movie with a queer protagonist. I remember wishing that this film had come out when I was in high school; young Becina could have used this.
But then I listened more closely and heard Simon say, "I'm just like you, except I have one huge ass secret: nobody knows I'm gay." That’s when the proverbial record scratched and the camera panned to Simon, an upper-class white male teenager. He’s not like me at all, except that he’s gay. Even beyond that, the “you” that Simon addresses in the trailer is a straight audience whom he’s desperate to convince that he’s just like them, except for this one tiny detail. The key identity that Simon and I share is a marginal blip to be overlooked, while the identities we don’t share are proof of his normalcy.
Before watching the movie, I felt torn. Now, having finally seen it, I'm still torn.
“Love, Simon” thrives on palatability. It fits the Hollywood mold of every other YA film with the typical Hollywood protagonist—white, cis, straight, wealthy male—except he’s gay. Then they threw in some light-skinned people of color for a dash of diversity.The film also gives far too much screen-time to straight characters. I understand that it's a plot point, but I don't care that Leah liked Simon or that Nick and Martin liked Abby but she only liked Nick back. If I wanted these types of plot lines, I'd watch a CW show. None of this was relevant to Simon's personal coming out journey; they all felt shoehorned in to give straight viewers a stake in the plot. Additionally, there’s not enough focus on Simon's journey of self-acceptance. The film conflates coming out with being comfortable with oneself. The end assumes that now that everyone at school knows his secret and he has a boyfriend, it'll all be okay. Yes, YA movies are known for their unrealistic plot lines and nice, wrapped-up-in-a-bow endings. But to pretend that coming out once equates to a lifetime of reclaiming your identity is misleading and even dangerous to any closeted queer viewers.Ultimately, “Love, Simon” wanted to be a feel-good love story that also touched on complex topics like coming out, identity, homophobia, and social isolation. But it missed that mark. A good coming out story must dig deeper into the emotional complexity and lived experiences of actual queer people—not a sanitized, Hollywood-approved wealthy white man. While "Love, Simon" lacks depth and nuance, it succeeds in simplistic nostalgia. This was the movie I needed in high school. Before I experienced racism in the BGLTQ community, before I was aware of the toll internalized homophobia takes on my life, before I learned to question the typical American ideal of white suburban upper-middle-class families, before I'd read the term "heteronormativity" on feminist blogs, before I realized the importance of intersectionality in media representation—well, I was just a terrified teen with a “huge ass secret” that no one could know about. And sometimes I forget what that's like to lie in bed at night tossing and turning because you're worried that your classmates know an inkling of your secret. What it's like to awkwardly come out to your friends while driving home from school, completely unprepared for anything they might say. What it's like to wish for queer friends while not wanting to downplay the attempted allyship of your straight friends.
This movie transported me back to a different time in my life, a time where it seemed like my entire existence was consumed by fear over this one thing. I cried when Simon’s mom told him how she felt he’d been “holding his breath” for the last few years. I cheered during the college dream sequence, fondly remembering my excitement at the prospect of living openly on a campus far from home. For two hours, I honestly felt 15 again.
But, I’m not 15 anymore, and I’m past the point in my journey when I thought that simply coming out would solve all my problems.
And, the fact of the matter is, I’m not just like Simon. And every queer person is not just like me. Differences in race, class, gender, gender expression, body shape, immigration status, ability, and more mean that the experience of queerness can be vastly different between people.
I left that theater and returned to my reality. I walked out surrounded by queer friends, most of whom were women and non-binary people of color from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. We shared our experiences with coming out in conservative religious homes, and the stark contrast to Simon’s ultra-progressive parents. We talked about how the ridiculous size of Simon’s bedroom represented the freedom and privacy he had to explore his sexuality—most of us shared bedrooms with siblings while growing up. We discussed how Simon, as a popular white person, already fit in well at school and did not experience the added “otherness” of being a visible minority that most of us faced.
So, while I love Simon and the youthful innocence he represents, he does not represent me or the majority of queer experiences.
Goodbye, Simon.
But I’ll tell my high school self that you say “Hi.” She’d love to meet you.

To Harvard’s BGLTQ students,
We’ve witnessed your pain and anger these last several weeks over events surrounding Harvard College Faith and Action. You’ve shown up in our offices and invited us to coffee. You’ve reached out to BGLTQ-affirming spaces on campus for support and you’ve written op-eds about your experience. And still there are many others who remain silently unsure if there is space on Harvard’s campus expansive enough to contain the fullness of both your sexual identity and your religious, spiritual, and ethical commitments. While we aren’t the arbiters of this issue on campus, it is our concern to speak to the pain, anger, and experience of religious and spiritual marginalization many of you have expressed.
We, the undersigned, are Harvard chaplains—religious leaders from a panoply of religious, spiritual, and ethical traditions—charged with cultivating student well-being at Harvard by attending to the ways religious, spiritual, and ethical concerns contribute to a flourishing life. While well-being and flourishing are our aim, we also recognize the power of religious discourse to perpetrate harm, able to cut to the heart of who we are as human beings in relation to what is of ultimate value in our religious, spiritual, or ethical tradition. And when religious discourse operates harmfully against students at Harvard, it is our responsibility to be fully present in those moments as well.
Recent events on campus have particularly affected many of you whose identity is formed at the intersection of an BGLTQ sexual or gender identity and a rootedness in Christian tradition. But the intersections of sexual and gender embodiment and religious, spiritual, and ethical identity are replete with questions in many of our traditions. The questions aren’t new, but the context of your living out these questions at this specific time on this campus we share is a unique moment.
While we represent a wide diversity of religious, spiritual, and ethical perspectives, a number of us felt so strongly about these issues that we wanted to create and sign this letter. In this time of ferment around sexual identity and faith at Harvard, we express these commitments to you, the BGLTQ students in this campus community we serve:
We commit to being on the journey of religious, spiritual, and ethical growth with you as companions who will give you our unequivocal support, inclusive of the fullness of your humanity in all of your sexual and gender diversity, ensuring that that religious, spiritual, and ethical resources be mobilized to contribute toward the flourishing and livability of life, and not toward harm.
We will come alongside you to cultivate the spaces of spiritual nourishment and BGLTQ affirmation that you most desire, honoring your voice, learning from your embodied wisdom, and supporting you with the wisdom and competency we bring into community with you.
We will show up for you. Find our contact information at chaplains.harvard.edu, write us, call us, tell us when and where you need our support. That’s why we got into this vocation. You’re why we serve within the Harvard community. No BGLTQ student on Harvard’s campus need ever feel that they are alone on the journey of reconciling their religious, spiritual, and ethical commitments with their embodiment of sexual and gender identity.
BGLTQ students: Harvard is not complete without you. Our religious, spiritual, and ethical communities on campus are not living into their fullest potential if you are excluded. Your lives are a gift to Harvard and to the world, and we celebrate that gift with deepest joy.
The Rev. Cody J. Sanders is the American Baptist chaplain for Harvard University. This op-ed is signed by fourteen chaplains serving Harvard University. Their names can be found here.

CrimsonEMS—a student-run volunteer Emergency Medical Service—has launched a “Stop the Bleed” initiative focused on increasing knowledge of bleeding control techniques in the case of public emergencies or medical accidents.
The group plans to begin public blood control technique trainings before the end of the school year, according to Harvard University Health Service administrator Susan Fitzgerald.
After attending the National Collegiate EMS Foundation conference in February, members of CrimsonEMS learned of the Stop the Bleed initiative, which was started by the White House in Oct. 2015 as a “national awareness campaign.”
Fitzgerald said recent events of mass violence like the shooting at a Parkland, Fla. high school and awareness campaigns like National Stop the Bleed Day on March 31 have indicated the necessity of this new initiative.
“You don’t need to wait for a national disaster. You don’t need to wait for a mass shooting,” Fitzgerald said. “This is the time of year to push this. This is a way to raise consciousness.”
Fitzgerald, an HUHS nurse leader and CrimsonEMS clinical liaison, said contrary to what some people think, blood loss emergencies can happen as a result of everyday situations.
“These can be a result of a car accident, a household kitchen accident, or something as simple as somebody falls off a metal bleacher and gashes their leg,” Fitzgerald said.
After coming back from the national conference, CrimsonEMS assembled a "bleeding control task force," whose goal it is to further the Stop the Bleed initiative by ensuring as many University affiliates as possible understand how to respond to bleeding emergencies.
“We plan to do so by publicizing the importance of the initiative, holding instructor and general bleeding control courses, securing funding for training materials, and pushing for our long-term goal of installing bleeding control kits in AED [automated external defibrillator] cabinets around the Harvard campus,” Sienna R. Nielsen ’19, CrimsonEMS community outreach officer, said.
Stop the Bleed Kits are currently available in all the AED cabinets at HUHS.
Fitzgerald said the new initiative will come with financial challenges in the long term, as CrimsonEMS hopes to supply blood control kits across campus. She said the group will focus on trainings first and infrastructure later.
“Very often the training part is the easiest because it doesn’t require very much. It’s just people training people and then empowering them with that knowledge,” Fitzgerald said. “The next phase is getting all the stuff labeled and out there where people can get it.”
In total, 5 percent of Harvard undergraduates have been CPR-trained, and CrimsonEMS leaders said they hope blood control trainings will further campus preparedness so people are ready to act when emergencies strike.
“We began to see this as a natural progression, that once people have learned CPR, learning how to stop bleeding is the next step,” Fitzgerald said.

Unlike many other schools and programs at Harvard, the Division of Continuing Education has been almost entirely financially self-sufficient in recent years, raising money through tuition and other programming rather than relying heavily on money from the University endowment.
The Division of Continuing Education offers online, in-person, and summer courses for part-time and adult students. DCE courses are offered through the Harvard Extension School and Harvard Summer School.
The University launched a capital campaign in 2013, with the goal of raising $6.5 billion across Harvard’s schools. In June 2017, the campaign total reached $8 billion, providing funding for a broad array of University initiatives.
While the Division of Continuing Education falls under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and participates in FAS’s larger fundraising efforts, the division decided not to launch their own fundraising campaign.
Huntington D. Lambert, dean of the Division of Continuing Education, said the division’s programs are largely self-sustaining based on money earned through tuition.
“We don't ask for any funding, so we don't get support from the endowment or the University. In fact, we send money back to the faculties,” Lambert said.
Harvard has faced budget constraints in recent years in the wake of poor endowment returns and  is projected to lose tens of millions annually because of a new endowment tax that Congress passed in December. The Division of Continuing Education, however, has been able to not only cover its own expenses, but also run a growing surplus.
Although other schools depend heavily on Harvard’s endowment for their annual budgets, most of the funds that the Division of Continuing Education receive from FAS’s portion of the endowment are dedicated to specific uses rather than daily operations.
“Almost all the money that comes out of [the endowment] is directed toward scholarships,” Lambert said.
“It’s more important to raise money for the College, and for House Renewal, and for advances in learning than it is for us,” he added.
Lambert said the Division of Continuing Education receives “almost all” of its funding from tuition. Tuition falls into a few main categories: the Extension School, the Harvard Summer School, a residential high school program, and professional development programs.
University spokesperson Harry J. Pierre wrote in an emailed statement that tuition at the Extension School is comparatively a better value than tuition of extension programs at peer universities. Lambert also said the tuition for Extension School courses is less expensive than for the College, though summer-term Extension School courses are priced more similarly to those offered by the College.
Although the College and several other graduate schools receive funding from alumni donations and gifts, the Division of Continuing Education has nearly no alumni contributions.
“It’s part of our history of being self-sufficient. My predecessors never developed alumni relationships,” Lambert said.
“That is something I’ve just started since I got here five years ago, so we’re now engaging our alumni around the world,” he added. “We hope that in the future that will lead to more giving.”

The Phillips Brooks House Association joined with several community groups to host a teach-in Saturday to discuss poverty-related issues and legislative movements related to poverty in Massachusetts.
The teach-in featured discussions on a variety of economic and social issues related to poverty during panels that ran throughout the Saturday. Panelists tackled the issue from many angles including youth poverty, education, housing, immigration, and the effects of the recent legalization of cannabis.
The primary co-host for the event was the advocacy organization Union of Minority Neighborhoods. Horace Small, the group’s founder and executive director, praised PBHA’s efforts and said he hoped that the group would continue to grow.
Other community groups in attendance included Massachusetts Jobs with Justice, Greater Boston Legal Services, St. John Missionary Baptist Church, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice.
“Sometimes we live in a very busy world and don’t know the issues our neighbors are facing,” said Jose A. Palma, a member of Justice at Work and participant in the immigration panel.
PBHA President Anwar Omeish ’19 wrote in an email that the organization was excited to connect these groups with students to prompt further dialogue and action, citing the event as an example of PBHA’s new emphasis on community partnership.
“We're excited to be able to bring these amazing community leaders to campus and connect students and community members to each other and to these important issues,” Omeish wrote.
Among the guests were James B. Eldridge, a Massachusetts state senator, and Marjorie C. Decker, a state representative. Both spoke about their efforts to change poverty legislation. Decker also spoke out her own past experiences with poverty.
Maria J. Dominguez Gray, executive director of PBHA, said the teach-in was an opportunity for students to promote grassroots efforts and to lead change in poverty policy, and that she hoped it could connect PBHA volunteers to members in the wider area who work on similar social issues.

The University rolled out a new pregnancy in the workplace policy Friday morning following a new Massachusetts law aimed at preventing pregnancy-based workplace discrimination.
The policy, which took effect on April 1, establishes that discrimination in hiring or employment practices on the basis of pregnancy is expressly prohibited and informs employees of their right to “reasonable accommodations for pregnancy and pregnancy-related conditions,” according to a statement sent to University employees from the Office of Labor and Employee Relations on Friday.
The change comes as a new piece of state legislation, the Massachusetts Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, takes effect. Passed in July, the law describes Mass. employers’ obligations to pregnant employees. It also requires that employers provide written notice of employees’ rights to accommodations for conditions related to pregnancy and lactation and freedom from pregnancy-based discrimination at work.
Harvard’s previous guidelines on pregnancy in the workplace dealt only with lactation, encouraging employers to work “individually and flexibly with all nursing mothers” to accommodate their needs, according to Paul R. Curran, University director of labor and employee relations. These guidelines were in compliance with existing federal laws, like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which mandates that pregnant women be “treated the same for all employment-related purposes.”
“Because of the practice encouraged in our previous guidelines, we do not anticipate much change in implementing the new Policy,” Curran wrote in an emailed statement.
Instead, the new policy “codifies” existing practices and includes protections for pregnancy-related conditions not addressed in earlier policy iterations, like morning sickness and fatigue.
“It is providing a process to employees, and the University, to explore how the worker’s needs regarding pregnancy can be reasonably met in the workplace,” Curran added.
Carrie Barbash—the president of the University’s largest labor union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—wrote in an email that the new policy could help clarify workers’ rights in situations which might otherwise be mishandled.
“Anything that makes it easier to be a parent in the workplace is a good thing,” Barbash wrote.
According to the new policy, some accommodations the University is prepared to make “without limitation” include: modified schedules, more frequent breaks, assistance with manual labor, paid or unpaid time off to attend to pregnancy complications, and private spaces for “expressing breast milk.”
Documentation from a medical professional may be requested for some of these accommodations and for other requests, according to the policy. Requests will be fulfilled absent any “undue hardship” for the University.
“The University will continue to work individually with workers to address needs related to pregnancy in the workplace,” Curran wrote.

Emma Dench, Dean-elect of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said the relationship between graduate students and their faculty advisers will be a major focus of her tenure as dean in an interview last month.
Dench, who stepped in as interim dean last year, will begin her tenure as the permanent GSAS dean on July 1.
Each semester, the GSAS dean meets with the directors of graduate studies from each department to discuss a major issue facing the school. This semester, the topics of the meeting focused on the advisor-student relationship, departmental climate, and power dynamics, according to Dench.
“In a recent director of graduate studies’ lunch, we discussed power dynamics, focusing on the adviser-student relationship. At GSAS, we are collecting best practices around advising with the aim of sharing them with our programs and departments,”she said.
According to a recent student life survey conducted by GSAS, nearly 10 percent of graduate students have concerns about the quality of their relationship with their primary adviser.
Dench added that, in recent years, some departments have encouraged faculty and graduate students to set out clear expectations for their relationship in the form of advising contracts.
The graduate school's renewed focus on the student-adviser relationship comes after The Chronicle of Higher Education reported last month that at least 18 women—including at least one former GSAS student—are accusing Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual harassment.
Several days after the Chronicle first reported the allegations, Dench encouraged graduate students to come forward with their concerns.
“As a student in Oxford and at the start of my academic career in London in the 1980s and 1990s, I experienced and witnessed disempowering situations similar to those noted in the article,” Dench wrote in an email. “I know that those who experience or witness sexual harassment, assault, or discrimination are often unsure whether or not to speak up.”
In the interview, Dench said that faculty attitudes towards advising have also changed since she began her academic career.
“When I was a young faculty member in England, the general assumption was that some people were really good at mentoring, mainly women,” she said. “And the rest, the student can go to someone else. Today, things are much different. There’s a hunger to learn and to be better.”
In addition to encouraging the use of advising contracts, Dench said she also plans to encourage faculty to attend workshops on how to navigate the advisor-student relationship.
Theda R. Skocpol, who served at GSAS dean from 2005 to 2007, said that while the relationship between Ph.D. students and faculty varies between disciplines, she encourages graduate students to rely on multiple mentors.
“I personally believe that a graduate student is well advised to have a principal adviser and a couple of other advisers, ideally a committee,” she said. “I don’t think it’s good for a graduate student to rely on one faculty member. You want to take some help and inspiration from multiple people.”
Other universities have also recently scrutinized the role of faculty advising in creating a safe environment for graduate students. In February, Yale President Peter Salovey approved a new set of faculty misconduct guidelines, including those governing “the exploitation of the faculty-student relationship.” Graduate students at Columbia also pressed administrators to make tangible reforms following reports in October that the University faced five federal sexual assault investigations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The University and anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions filed clashing briefs Friday outlining opposing arguments on whether the College’s admissions data should become public as part of an ongoing lawsuit against Harvard.
In its brief, Harvard argued sensitive documents should “be filed provisionally under seal,” asserting the documents must remain confidential to protect applicants’ privacy and to safeguard the details of its admissions process. Students for Fair Admissions, though, asserted documents should be publicly filed.
The group cited strong public interest and a “strong presumption of public access” in the case, claiming both considerations outweigh Harvard’s stated need for privacy.
Both parties submitted the Friday briefings as part of a lawsuit filed by Students for Fair Admissions in 2014. The suit alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process; the College has repeatedly denied any such discrimination.
The Friday filings do not mark the first time Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions have gone to battle over College admissions data. Harvard agreed to provide the group with redacted admissions documents in Dec. 2017. Though the University redacted “directly identifying information,” the documents still contain data points Harvard officials fear could be used to identify students—like awards earned during high school or hometowns.
“Such information can easily be used to locate and identify a student through a simple internet search,” Harvard’s Friday briefing reads.
Harvard lawyers also wrote in the filing that publicly releasing “highly proprietary” information like application data, deposition testimonies, and internal communications could compromise the College’s admissions system.
“Publicizing this information would cause applicants and college consultants to seek to orient their applications to what they perceive Harvard wants, to the detriment of the authenticity of the information Harvard receives and its ability to make its best judgments,” the briefing reads.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard considers many factors when deciding whether or not a student is admitted.
“Many highly academically qualified individuals apply to Harvard College,” Dane wrote. “To deliver on our educational mission, our admissions practices consider the whole person, their capacity not only for academic excellence, but also their ability to contribute to and learn from people profoundly different from themselves.”
The Friday briefing noted that, while any admissions-related documents Harvard releases may not necessarily render individual students identifiable, it would be necessary to individually evaluate every single document to determine whether this is the case. Therefore, University lawyers wrote, Harvard opposes publicly filing the documents in bulk.
The lawyers cited a number of cases in which confidential documents were filed under seal. Students for Fair Admissions, on the other hand, questioned whether this practice is permissible.
“Other than individual student identities, the record that the court will analyze in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard should be made available to the American public,” Students for Fair Admissions President Edward Blum wrote in an emailed statement Monday. “Public disclosure and complete transparency of court proceedings is the bedrock of our judicial system.”
In its briefing, lawyers for the anti-affirmative action group wrote Harvard has not proven it is necessary to seal the documents for either privacy or proprietary reasons. The briefing further argued the public has a strong interest in civil rights litigation, especially as it relates to the consideration of race in college admissions.
“It would be impossible for the public to understand whether Harvard’s admissions system—especially the pivotal internal mechanisms used to sort and advance applicants through the process—is being manipulated if they are prevented from knowing how the system is supposed to work in the first place,” the group’s briefing reads.
Andrew D. Bradt ’02, an assistant law professor at University of California, Berkeley, said it would be atypical if the court decides to weigh Students for Fair Admissions’ claim that the public has significant interest in the case over Harvard’s privacy concerns.
“It's unusual for the plaintiff's view of the groundbreaking nature of their case to overwhelm a defendant's legitimate interest in confidentiality,” Bradt said.
In their brief, lawyers for the advocacy group also argued Harvard’s admissions procedures do not constitute a “trade secret” and therefore are not confidential.
The lawyers cited several publications—including the New York Times and The Crimson—that previously published articles touching on the details of the admissions process. The lawyers also cited a number of previous cases in which courts rejected the “blanket sealing” of documents.
Bradt said the judge has essentially total power to decide whether Harvard or Students for Fair Admissions—or neither—win the day regarding the confidentiality of admissions documents. Bradt added whatever the judge concludes will likely hold throughout future litigation.
“This is an area where the judge has enormous discretion, and the rules give the judge a lot of leeway to balance the interests of the parties and the public interest. Whatever the judge ultimately decides is probably unlikely to be reversed by an appellate court,” Bradt said.
The Friday briefs come in the wake of a March 14 order from Judge Allison D. Burroughs requiring Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions to “meet and confer regarding the treatment of confidential materials to narrow the areas of dispute.” Burroughs scheduled a follow-up hearing on the subject slated to be held April 10 at the U.S. District Court in Boston.
The judge’s order also laid out a tentative timeline for the overall lawsuit, setting Jan. 2 as the potential start date for a four-week trial. In its briefing, Harvard raised several concerns with the proposed timeline, in particular arguing the schedule means College administrators will be forced to deal with the lawsuit during admissions season, when officials review thousands of applications.
Both parties will discuss the timeline at the April 10 hearing.
Bradt said that, as the lawsuit moves forward, he thinks it is possible more of the material Harvard hopes to protect will become public—no matter what the judge decides.
“If there would ultimately be a trial, then it's inevitable that some of the information that the University wants to keep confidential would be aired,” Bradt said. “That might not mean the particular circumstances of individual applicants, but the longer the litigation goes, certainly the more likely it is that more information will come to light.”
As Harvard deals with the Student for Fair Admissions lawsuit in coming months, it also faces an ongoing probe by the Department of Justice into the College’s admissions practices.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College will increase the student activities fee—an optional sum Harvard undergraduates pay as part of their enrollment costs—from $75 to $200 next academic year, Alexander R. Miller, associate dean for student engagement, said in an interview Monday.
The $125—or more than 150 percent—increase marks the first change to the fee in over a decade.
The Office of Student Life also plans to restructure the way it funds the Undergraduate Council, the College Events Board, House Committees, and the Intramural Sports Council starting fall 2018, Miller said.
Before, the UC took charge of all money gathered via the activities fee and distributed it to campus student groups at the discretion of its finance committee. Now, though, the OSL plans to form a new committee—comprising both students and administrators—that will help allocate funds gathered through the activities fee.
The committee will in part distribute funds according to student groups’ ability to engage with undergraduates, according to Miller.
Miller said these changes are meant to make the funding system for student organizations more “sustainable” going forward. The activities fee increase and the funding system restructuring come at a time of widespread turnover and transition at Harvard.
After 11 years at the helm, University President Drew G. Faust will step down in June 2018. President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow will take office in July.
Money gathered via the activities fee only constitutes a segment of funding used to support undergraduate social programming. In recent years, the College has also relied on donations as well as a portion of the University president’s discretionary fund. Faust has provided part of her discretionary fund to the College, which has used the money to cover the cost of undergraduate social events, since at least 2015.
By default, undergraduates pay the student activities fee, but they can avoid the charge by mailing a letter to the College before Sept. 30 each year detailing their reasons for opting out. All requests are honored, according to the Harvard College Student Handbook.
Over the past three years, roughly 1 percent of undergraduates have chosen to opt out of the fee, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.  All students are eligible to opt out regardless of their financial aid status, Dane said.
Miller acknowledged some students will choose to avoid the fee after the 150 percent increase and said he and other administrators have sought to calculate the impact of the hike. Ultimately, though, Miller said the OSL believes the overall amount of money gathered via the student activities fee will increase in the 2018-2019 school year.
Currently, the fee brings in roughly $500,000,according to Miller.
“This will allow students to take advantage of a greater pool of funds,” Miller said of the changes.
The new “funding board” charged with allocating money gathered via the activities fee will comprise College administrators, as well as undergraduate representatives from the UC, CEB, House Committees, and the IM Council, Miller said.
He added that the College is still developing the framework for this new committee. In particular, administrators and students are working to determine how many board representatives each group will receive—as well as the criteria the board will use to distribute funding.
“Each year, each organization would go before this board, and this board would be looking at their overall year, so assessing their year,” Miller said. “It’s one thing to come to the board and ask for funding, but I think the board will also be asking, ‘So with the current funding you’re using, how are you assessing it, how are you engaging with students?’”
Miller announced the changes to student life funding directly to members of the UC, CEB, House Committees, and the IM Council in meetings with all four bodies over the past two weeks.
The Undergraduate Council has long pushed for an increase to the student activities fee, which has held steady at $75 since 2006. In 2012, for example, then-UC President Daniel P. Bicknell ’13 and UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 recommended that the College increase the fee to between $115 and $160 in a commissioned report. At the time, they argued that some of Harvard’s peer institutions had much higher activities fees.
This semester, with the Council’s finance committee once again facing a budget shortfall, some UC leaders say the activities fee increase is welcome news. Boucher said in an interview Monday that he is supportive of the fee hike and is optimistic the Council will benefit from the change.
“I’m very hopeful that we’ll be able to increase the amount of funding that goes to the UC through the funding board that will be created,”  UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher '19 said. “In our informal conversations with the administration, the idea has been that the pool of money will be large enough that it’s at the very least feasible for the UC to request more money than it currently has.”
The increase in the activities fee brings the College in line with some of its peer institutions. The average activities fee across five Ivy League schools who disclose that information online—Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Yale, and Columbia—is $205 per year.
In another change, student group funding will now be tied to the University’s fiscal calendar—which runs from July 1 to June 30—as opposed to the academic calendar, according to Miller. He noted this revision will most directly affect student groups whose budgeting or election cycles do not line up with the University’s fiscal year.
“They could potentially be applying for a year that they may not be fully serving in,” Miller said. “So that may require some level of wisdom or oversight from student organizations, but I do think it will challenge groups to think about their overall leadership structures, how that transition plays out with its budget cycle and what that might mean for the overall governance of the group.”
Currier House Committee co-chair Danielle E. Katz ’19 said she supports the fee increase. She sought to put the $125 hike in perspective.
“I think it’s a relatively small amount,” Katz said.  “I mean, it’s not even 1 percent of what we pay every year to go here… so I don’t think it should be that big of a concern.”
Harvard announced last week that undergraduate enrollment costs will increase by 3 percent for the 2018-2019 academic year.

This article is the second in a two-part series on diversity at the Harvard Kennedy School. Read the first installment here.
First, it was Institute of Politics Director Maggie A. Williams, who announced last April she would leave the role she had held for three years. Next came Karen Y. Jackson-Weaver, who stepped down from her post as the Kennedy School’s dean of students last spring. And in November, after publicly declaring she did not feel supported at the Kennedy School, Alexandra Martinez—then the assistant dean for the diversity and inclusion office—followed suit.
In the span of just over six months, the Harvard Kennedy School lost three prominent African-American women leaders. The departures came amid increasing scrutiny of diversity at the school, which has faced internal criticism for its lack of minority students, faculty, and staff.
Though the reasons for the women's departures varied, Lauren R. Powell, a 2017 master’s in public administration graduate of the Kennedy School, said she finds it “alarming” that these women all decided to leave at around the same time.
“That’s the part no one can explain to me,” Powell said. “How many other people are leaving the Kennedy School in mass exodus like this? And how many women in positions of leadership and how many of them are black women?”
The Kennedy School has been working for years to diversify and to address concerns shared by minority affiliates at the school. The school established its Office for Student Diversity and Inclusion in 2012, and Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf convened a task force on diversity and inclusion in 2016. In May 2017, that group released a draft report outlining demographic statistics and proposing a number of measures to promote minority faculty recruitment and curricular offerings that appeal to students from a range of backgrounds.
“Faculty at the Harvard Kennedy School come from a range of backgrounds and perspectives. However, U.S. historically underrepresented minorities are also underrepresented on our faculty, according to a range of definitions or benchmarks,” the report reads. “Without that diversity, we risk taking narrow views on policy issues important to our students and to the world and to missing important issues altogether.”
Students and faculty say the dearth of minority faculty and administrators at the school leaves students of color lacking role models and feeling uncomfortable discussing race in the classroom. The recent departures of prominent female African-American administrators, many say, has not helped.
Jackson-Weaver, who students and faculty describe as very active and interested in student life, left the school abruptly last May, surprising and confusing some students.
“There’s not a student group that didn’t know her,” Powell said. “I really don’t believe she’s replaceable. I don’t believe that anyone they can get will have the same passion and the same connection with students.”
Kennedy School lecturer Richard Parker described Jackson-Weaver as “a very good, energetic, committed person.”
“I had no complaints whatsoever about her,” Parker said. “I thought she was very widely admired by the students, and I was rather surprised when she left."
Jackson-Weaver did not respond to requests for comment.
Williams left the Institute of Politics in April 2017, citing her long commute and asserting she had achieved her primary goals. Her tenure as director was marked by controversy; some critics said Williams's role on the Clinton campaign comprised a breach of the IOP’s commitment to nonpartisanship. At one point, several alumni and students called for Williams’ resignation.
Former IOP President Jesse I. Shelburne ’18 said at the time Williams's resignation was not connected to these events.
Martinez, on the other hand, made clear at a meeting of the school’s student-run diversity committee, a week before she left, that her decision to leave the Kennedy School directly stemmed from the “lack of support” she received from other school leaders.
“There was insufficient support for the office in terms of financial support as well as staff support,” Martinez said. “I had been requesting additional support over the last five years, and whereas I saw a minimal support being added here and there, it was just so far off the mark that it was really disheartening.”
Elmendorf declined to comment on Martinez’s departure and on criticisms of the school.
The departures of several high-profile women of color at the school made waves within the diversity task force itself, causing at least one task force member to become disillusioned about the prospects for change and to ultimately step down from the body.
Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 chaired the “Campus Life and Culture” committee of the task force until he left the group last spring. He attributed the decision to his belief that the school has “a diversity, inclusion, belonging, equity, and justice problem” which manifested itself in the departures of these African-American female administrators, specifically Jackson-Weaver.
“[Jackson-Weaver] was, in my time at the Kennedy School, without question or exception, the finest administrative presence in the building, and had been there for two and a half years, and and suddenly departed, with nowhere to go, at the end of the year,” McCarthy said. “It became clear to me through a series of conversations with various people that something problematic was afoot, and there was a reason why people were leaving.”
Students and faculty members said that, regardless of the reasoning behind these departures, the women's exits exacerbated the longstanding dearth of people of color and women professors and top administrators at the school.
According to the diversity task force’s report, the school employed five African-American faculty members in 2017, two of whom were tenured professors. African-American representation on the staff level has remained “stagnant” over time—in 2005, African Americans comprised 6.1 percent of Kennedy School staff; by 2015, that number rose to just 6.6 percent. Latinx faculty members in the U.S. made up 2 percent of the faculty in 2016. In the 2017 academic year, only two faculty members classified in the report as “Hispanic” taught at the school, both as full professors.
By contrast, across the University as a whole, 18 percent of faculty and 22 percent of staff come from underrepresented minority groups, according to the final report of a University-wide task force on inclusion and belonging released last week.
Without adequate minority representation in the Kennedy School’s classrooms and offices, “we have insufficient faculty role models for our students,” the HKS task force report reads.
Shaniqua L. McClendon, a second-year master’s of public policy student and president of the Black Student Union, said the departures of prominent African-American women left her and other students of color with fewer advisers and role models who can empathize with their personal experiences.
“With those people leaving or not being here as much, it significantly reduced the people that we have access to which can have an affect on how you experience graduate school because graduate school is not the easiest thing in the world,” McClendon said. “It's stressful, and when you have fewer people that you feel like you identify with, and you feel comfortable talking to, it can make the experience a lot more isolating.”
Apart from its impact on mentorship, some students said the absence of faculty of color also impacts the curricula and discussions that take place in Kennedy School classrooms.
Meredith Davis Tavera, the co-president for the Latinx Caucus, said this is especially true for Latinx students on campus.
“One of the things that we see missing the most is actually just people who are working on issues that affect Latinx communities and policies that affect Latinx communities disproportionately, and who are looking at it from the perspective of how they affect our communities,” Davis Tavera said.
Davis Tavera could only name one of the two Latinx professors at the Kennedy School–George J. Borjas, a professor of economics and immigration policy, who has written extensively about the negative impacts of immigration on the American economy and workers.
Borjas did not respond to requests for comment.
Khalil G. Muhammad, one of the two African-American tenured professors at the school, said the lack of minority faculty is “striking” to students of color and leads to gaps in understanding between students and professors.
“There is a lack of literacy, a lack of fluency, and when tough questions are being raised, they tend to be pushed outside of the classroom for fear of alienating some students or making people feel uncomfortable,” Muhammad said.
Laura E. Merryfield, a master’s in public policy student at HKS, said professors—especially those who teach “more analytical” courses—are not necessarily inclined to integrate themes of diversity and inclusion into their lessons.
“There are a lot of ways where we can be more broadly talking about these issues in our coursework, but it hasn’t been seen,” Merryfield said. “There’s a sense that you don’t need to make these things explicit in order to successfully teach a class.”
Muhammad also said, as one of the only black faculty members studying and teaching about racism and civil rights, he experiences a heightened level of responsibility to mentor students actively researching these areas.
“There are few people at the Kennedy School who are prepared to answer those questions [about race], so where my experience differs to that is I have to be ready to take on a lot of additional questions and curiosities and research projects and all sorts of things that are perfectly valid because there are so few people at the school who explicitly care and show concern and have expertise in those areas,” Muhammad said.
Powell said that, in her two years at the Kennedy School, she actively sought out courses taught by African-American professors because she felt their classrooms—unlike many other spaces at the school—were places she could talk about race.
“So many of these courses talk about race indirectly, and we try to water it down with terms like people of color, underserved communities,” Powell said.
According to the task force report, 25 percent of the cases Kennedy School professors used in their courses recently featured an “underrepresented minority group or were directly about race.”
The task force recommended increasing the number of cases and “curricular materials that feature diverse actors and content related to the challenges arising from diversity.”
Muhammad said he believes the curriculum should place greater emphasis on historical analysis and applying historical models related to race and racism in lessons about politics and policy-making.
“You can't entirely solve the problem just by putting in black or brown or native scholars; you'll also have to bring in faculty whose enterprise is precisely in these areas,” Muhammad said. “You need more faculty that represents the world as it actually is, but you also need some of that representation to be scholars who speak directly to race and racism as it has played out for centuries in the U.S. and elsewhere."
The task force report bluntly acknowledged the “underrepresentation” of  “U.S. historically underrepresented minorities” among the faculty and proposed a number of recruitment measures to address the problem.
“While it is true that the Ph.D. pipelines from which we hire the vast majority of our faculty are not as diverse as the U.S. population as a whole and that the faculty hiring process and turnover is much slower than for staff, it is essential that we have a diversity of perspectives on policy issues at HKS,” the report reads.
“Over the past 10 years, despite efforts to diversify the HKS faculty, we have not made as much progress as we’d have liked,” the report continues.
The task force identified implicit bias as a probable culprit.
“While we think we have the very best faculty in the world, to the extent that there is implicit bias in our search processes, we may miss truly top-notch faculty altogether,” its report reads.
The report recommended initiatives to promote minority recruitment within the four steps of the faculty hiring process, including creating “a bridge” to tenure-track positions through a postdoctoral program, providing search committees with guidelines to solicit nominations from “women and minority scholars,” and conducting a “blind reading of applications” without names or Ph.D. programs visible. Another recommendation called on search committees to provide an explanation for removing minority candidates from shortlists before they receive an invitation to visit campus.
A document provided by Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel listed progress on several of the task force’s recommendations. Suzanne J. Cooper, academic dean for teaching and curriculum, “revised the guidance” on hiring to include additional material on bias when faculty search committees read applications, according to the document.
“We are providing the revised guidance to each search, promotion, or review committee as it begins work, and we will distribute the guidance to all faculty members when they consider and vote on hires, promotions, and reviews,” the document reads.
The document also asserts the Kennedy School “will evaluate the benefits and costs” of a postdoctoral program for scholars from underrepresented groups “over time.”
Students from various affinity groups at the school are continuing to urge the school to recruit diverse faculty and administrators.
Bryan Cortes, a first-year M.P.P. student and member of the Latinx Caucus, said the caucus focused on pushing for more diverse faculty members and fellows at the school’s various centers, including the Shorenstein Center and the Institute of Politics.
“I know for example the Shorenstein Center next semester—I can't reveal the name—but I know they're going to have a fellow focused on Latino and Hispanic media so it's encouraging to see those stats going forward,” Cortes said.
The Kennedy School also announced a new fellowship in March aimed at students with a “strong commitment” to Latinx issues in honor of the late Lisa M. Quiroz ’83. The fellowship, housed at the Center for Public Leadership, will provide funding for students who have demonstrated an interest in reducing disparities in U.S. Latinx and other underserved communities.
Davis said it is easier for students to push the school to appoint Latinx fellows—whom she called “low-hanging fruit”—because of the slow process of hiring new faculty and senior administration officials.
“Since last year when the diversity task force report came out and they got a little bit of blowback for that process, I think [the dean has] been a little bit more transparent in walking us through the processes of how they go about searching for faculty, and now that they've hired the new dean of diversity and inclusion, that's a really positive sign,” Davis said. “So there's been some things that have been good.”
The school recently hired Robbin Chapman as its new associate dean of diversity and inclusion in January. She will assume that role this month.
The Black Student Union has also contributed to the faculty hiring discussion, recommending in a written response to the diversity task force report that the school examine the faculty hiring process “for any implicit bias.” The student group also urged the school to recognize and compensate the “unseen work” undertaken by faculty of color.
According to Elmendorf, the Kennedy School has already begun to make strides in recruiting more people of color for faculty and top administrative roles.
“We have filled a number senior positions with women of color over the past year or two,” Elmendorf said. “So the story is not just one of departures.”
He specifically pointed to Chapman, the school’s new associate dean for diversity, inclusion, and belonging, as well as a new communications director and chief financial officer—all of whom are women of color.
McCarthy said he believes the dean appointment represents a “turn in the right direction” towards a more substantial commitment to issues of diversity and representation and that he admired Elmendorf’s willingness to listen and “take the heat.” Still, he said there is much more to be done.
“I think there are some very pressing questions that continue to be questions about diversity and inclusion and belonging and equity and justice at the Kennedy School that I think remained unanswered,” McCarthy said. “Part of that is because there are no easy answers and part of that is because I don’t think we’re doing enough to figure out what those answers are.”
“I always have hope for the future, until proven otherwise,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With three conference series already in the books, Harvard softball has jumped out to an early lead in the Ivy League. The key to its success? The process.
“Trust the process” is a sports cliché that has gained prominence because of the tanking and rebuilding efforts of the National Basketball Association’s Philadelphia 76ers. Though it is unclear whether the Crimson could make a copyright claim on the phrase or whether the team borrowed it along the way, Harvard has embraced all facets of coach Jenny Allard’s process.
“It’s really sticking to putting ourselves in a good mindset, and all the work we can do physically beforehand,” junior pitcher Katie Duncan said. “I think that’s the process—being able and aware each and every step of the way to contribute and to put all your effort out there.”
Coming off a three-game sweep of Princeton, the Crimson (13-11, 6-3 Ivy League) will travel to New York to face off against another Ivy South Division opponent this coming weekend. This time, Harvard battles an upstart Columbia program (11-14, 5-4). The Lions have not registered a winning season in the Ancient Eight for over 10 years, but this spring they have won their series against Penn and Yale and picked up a win over Dartmouth.
Despite Columbia’s struggles in recent campaigns, the Lions swept the Crimson in last year’s two-game set. The second game of that series proved particularly painful for Harvard, as Columbia rattled off four runs in the bottom of the seventh to walk off with a 6-5 victory.
This season, the Lions return a few top contributors and are paced offensively by senior infielders Taylor Troutt and Madison Gott. Troutt is batting .408 with a 1.109 OPS, and Gott has posted a .362 average and a 1.075 OPS. Gott and Troutt sit third and fourth, respectively, in slugging percentage in the conference, and Gott paces the Ancient Eight with 12 doubles. The Lions also have a cadre of long-ball hitters—freshman Maria Pagane and sophomore Amanda Nishihira have bashed five apiece, and Gott has tacked on four of her own. As a team, Columbia leads the Ivy League with 22 big flies.
Compared to its high-powered offense, the Lions’ pitching staff is not as remarkable. Columbia sits at fifth in the conference in ERA (4.25) and has allowed opposing batters to hit .300.
To prepare for a Lions offense that will likely put up more resistance than that of Princeton, the Crimson may need to draw upon its experiences in pressure situations this past weekend.
“When Princeton got ahead for instance, or when we had one or two outs and we still needed to rally and had people on base, being able to execute in those high-pressure situations...allows us to really hone in on our skills, especially in the Ivy season,” Duncan said.
For her efforts against Princeton, shortstop Rhianna Rich was named Ivy League Player of the Week. The junior captured the award for the second time this season. In 24 games, Rich is slashing .398/.468/.590 with six stolen bases and Ivy-leading marks of four triples and 30 runs scored.
Prior to its upcoming series in New York, Harvard was slated to play Boston University on Tuesday evening, but predictions of inclement weather and poor field conditions at the Terriers’ home field led the teams to postpone the affair.
This is the third game on the Crimson’s 2018 schedule to be called off—Harvard missed a contest against FGCU in the Loyola Marymount Invitational because of rain, and last Thursday a matchup at Holy Cross was likewise postponed.
Speaking of the opportunity to tune up at BU before heading to Columbia, Rich spoke on the value of playing such a talented team to prepare for an Ivy series.
“BU...beat Oklahoma, which was the No. 1 ranked team at the time in preseason, which was a really big win for them,” Rich said. “I think it’s honestly a great game to prepare for the next weekend because Columbia will be a strong team.”
Though the Crimson ultimately will not have this chance to prepare with a midweek game, it can use this postponement to build some rest into its schedule. After all, with the new three-game conference series format, Harvard is guaranteed at least one doubleheader each week until the end of the regular season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past 11 seasons, Penn State has exercised a strict hegemony on the EIVA men’s volleyball title. Over the course of that decade-plus of first place finishes, the Nittany Lions have shared the title but never once finished below the top spot. This weekend, however, the juggernaut no longer commands the title. Harvard does.
With victories over Saint Francis and Penn State this weekend, the Crimson now controls its own destiny heading into the final stretch of the season.
“This win meant a ton to our team, as it validated all of the hard work we had put in and gives us confidence as we head towards playoffs that we can compete with the best teams,” captain Riley Moore said. “It was also a very special win for the seniors as this was our last chance to beat Penn State, and being able to do it at home in front of family and friends made it even more special.”
HARVARD 3, PENN STATE 2
The Crimson (9-11, 8-2 EIVA) has squared up against the Nittany Lions (12-9, 7-3) for 30 years, often multiple times per season. Prior to Saturday, Harvard had managed to best Penn State just once over that span.
This weekend, in the well-attended Malkin Athletic Center, the Crimson reversed history and downed its long-time opponent in five sets to claim its third straight win.
Moore dominated at the net for his team, tallying a career-high and team-best 14 kills—four more than his previous season-best, notched the game prior. The senior’s zero errors, a feat achieved by Moore for the sixth time this season, allowed him to rack up a hitting percentage of .875.
Harvard initially jumped up two games, 25-13 and 32-30. The hot start was quickly curtailed by the Nittany Lions, who clapped back with two wins, 25-27 and 16-25.
The final set started as a back-and-forth affair. The two squads traded one-point leads and eventually evened out at 6-6. From there, the Crimson took control, achieving a 12-9 lead before finishing off the set, 15-12. And just like that, the 2018 team added its name to a list previously populated by just a single Harvard men’s volleyball team, the 2014 squad.
“In the fifth set Coach [Brian] Baise put it on the seniors to make sure we pulled through and got this victory for the team,” Moore said. “I think we took that confidence he put in us and used it to finish out the match.”
Senior Brad Gretsch managed his second double-double of the season, adding 13 kills, nine digs and two aces to the stat book. Senior Marko Kostich and sophomore Matthew Ctvrtlik both managed to break 20 assists with 29 and 22, respectively. Junior Trevor Dow led the team in kills, tallying a season best nine and zero errors. The junior served as the vanguard of the defense with seven blocks, three of which were solo. Overall, the Crimson out-blocked its opponent at the net, 18-19.
The meeting between the two teams was the second of the year. In a February 17th meeting between the two teams, Penn State dominated, winning in a clean 3-0 sweep.
HARVARD 3, SAINT FRANCIS 1
The weekend slate began with a solid performance against a divisional Red Flash team (8-17, 3-7). Taking the game in four sets, the Crimson picked things up quickly.
Moore again led the offensive front again, tying his season best in kills with 10—a mark he would top the next day. Both Gretsch and sophomore Erik Johnsson reached double-digit kill marks with 15 and 12, respectively. Kostich and Ctvrtlik handled the team in assists with 18 and 19 respectively.
In games, Harvard curtailed its opponent twice initially, with 25-15 and 25-19 games. The team then dropped the next set, 15-25, before putting the game away by the inverse score.
With the two victories, the Crimson can claim the conference by winning out. Ranked second in the conference behind George Mason, Harvard will square off with the Patriots in two weeks. Assuming wins this weekend against Princeton and NJIT, the home matches against the George Mason will decide the EIVA Championship.
“Obviously it’s a situation we’d like to be in at this point in the season, but it also means that we have to fight for these last four games,” Johnsson said. “It also means that we have a chance to win the conference which is something we haven’t been able to do in a long time. After our performance in these last few games, I think we have a really good shot to do it.”

It was recently announced that Wale and Lil Yachty will be headlining Yardfest this year, a marked difference from the EDM music of the past two years. People seem to be pretty excited, but you don’t know who these people are; you’re classy and listen to the lyrically complex musings of artists like Halsey. Never fear, we’ve got you.
Wale
Now why, you might be wondering, would someone misspell ‘whale’ so badly, and why, you might continue, would they want to be called that? Well, good news, that’s not what happened. Wale is not pronounced like “whale,” nor is it pronounced like “Wall-E.” The proper pronunciation is“wah-lay.” Now that we’ve got that cleared up, who is he?
Born and raised in Washington, D.C. (the 202!) to parents who immigrated from Nigeria, Wale went to college at Robert Morris College and Virginia State on football scholarships, eventually transferring to Bowie State. He gained success in the DMV in the early 2000s, eventually signing with Interscope in 2008. Since then, he has featured on a number of hits including “No Hands” by Waka Flocka Flame, and “Ride Out” from the Furious 7 soundtrack. He’s got two #1 albums to his name, and his most recent release was the EP, It’s Complicated, in March 2018.
Wale makes the kind of rap you can actually dance to with go-go inspired rhythms, but doesn’t cut corners when it comes to his lyrics. Get excited.
Lil Yachty
Memorable for more than just his stage name and trademark red-beaded hair, Lil Yachty has taken off with what he describes as “bubblegum trap.” His playful lyrics and brighter, colorful sound have found success in songs like “Minnesota” (yes, the one from the Sprite commercial), Chance the Rapper’s “Mixtape,” KYLE’s “iSpy,” and the Grammy-nominated “Broccoli.”
From Mableton, Ga., Lil Yachty first achieved success when his song “1 Night” blew up on SoundCloud. He debuted as a model at Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 3 fashion show at Madison Square Garden in February 2016. Lil Yachty’s mixtape, Lil Boat was released shortly thereafter in March 2016, and he signed a joint record deal with Quality Control Music, Motown Records, and Capitol Records in June. His most recent releases are Lil Boat 2 and “Gucci Flip Flops” with Bhad Bhabie.
In short, it’s gonna be lit. And if you still aren’t convinced, well, you’re probably going to be drunk anyway, and drunk you is going to have a great time.
