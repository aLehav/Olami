After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“May we entertain you?” the stardom-bound Baby June sings innocently at the beginning of Arthur Laurents’ 1959 Broadway hit “Gypsy.” At first, the musical seems just as innocent, promising a heartwarming rags-to-riches story centering on June’s vaudeville act. But as her family descends into the seedy world of burlesque and her overly supportive mother Rose’s psyche begins to deteriorate, the musical reveals itself to be much darker than it first appears. With its examination of Rose’s destructive ambition and complex character, the show has been hailed as one of the greatest musicals of all time, leaving Harvard College Musical Theater with large shoes to fill. Yet the production on the Loeb Mainstage successfully captured Laurents’ vision, illustrating the grand scope of vaudeville’s decline while never losing sight of the musical’s emotional core.
“Gypsy” focuses on the unyielding ambition of Rose (Sumner N. Perera ’19), who tries to mold her daughter June (Brooke E. Sweeney ’17) into a vaudeville star. In the process, she relegates June’s meek sister Louise (Sarah B. Rossman ’19) to the role of a backup singer and secures a talent agent, Herbie (Jacob C. Scherba ’18), by promising to marry him. When June escapes her mother’s tyranny and elopes with Tulsa (Ben D. Grimm ’18), a backup dancer, Rose decides to turn Louise into the star of her next act. Yet Louise’s self-admitted lack of talent and the public’s waning interest in vaudeville acts force Louise and Rose into the world of striptease. Louise, under the name Gypsy Rose Lee, becomes a star of sorts, just not the vaudeville entertainer that Rose had envisioned.
Based on the memoirs of real-life burlesque star Gypsy Rose Lee, “Gypsy” charts the course of Louise’s life, from childhood to adulthood. Despite the confusion of the musical’s constantly changing settings, necessary to cover this long timeframe, the inspired direction of Caro P. Ribeiro ’18 kept the production engaging. Her staging of transitions between large gaps in time was inventive: In “Baby June and Her Newsboys” and “Let Me Entertain You,” major flash forwards were integrated into the choreography and the musical structure of each song. In particular, “Let Me Entertain You” perfectly illustrated Louise’s transformation from an innocent, shy performer to a confident striptease artist. The conductor of the pit orchestra and music director of the show, Christopher S. Lee ’18, played the role of announcer for Louise’s increasingly lewd performances as she grew into the persona of Gypsy Rose Lee, performing her act for the audience with increasing confidence in each verse. This gradual transformation was especially effective in depicting Louise’s developing freedom and self-confidence.
Other aspects of the production were similarly effective. The costume design, by Anisa O. Ahmed  ’20 and Camille N’diaye-Muller ’18, emphasized the comedy of June’s show, with Baby June becoming a young adult while maintaining the same childish costume. At the same time, it provided dramatic contrast between the innocent vaudeville scenes and the racier, disempowering world of burlesque. The set design (Kat T. Nakaji) was similarly effective, with a stage within the stage, at first used when June or Louise performed directly for the audience, then used as a potent visualization of Rose’s desire for fame in the showstopper finale, “Rose’s Turn.” There was even an ingenious rose pattern painted above the curtains to complement Rose’s line, “Everything’s coming up roses!” The harsh spotlights and darker lighting during these scenes helped highlight Louise and Rose’s vulnerability in the second act.
A character-centered musical like “Gypsy” relies heavily on the strength of its actors, and Harvard’s production did not disappoint. Sweeney warbled in June’s high register with glee, and Scherba grounded Rose’s antics with his affable, levelheaded portrayal of Herbie. Rossman made Louise the emotional center of the musical, with her palpable vulnerability and fear finally giving way to a rousing assertiveness and self-reliance at the musical’s end. The technical prowess of Grimm’s tap-dancing as Tulsa in “All I Need is the Girl” as well as the powerful vocals of striptease star Mazeppa (Stephanie M. Johnson ’18) during “You Gotta Have a Gimmick” also added to the immense talent of the actors.
Still, Perera stood out from the rest of the cast as Rose. From the first minutes of “Gypsy” to Rose’s final psychological deterioration, Perera commanded the stage, manipulating and snapping at other characters with gusto. Her singing was particularly striking, with a rich vibrato and an extraordinarily deep tone. Her interpretation of “Rose’s Turn,” performed with gripping drama and bitterness, provided a fitting end to the musical.
In the end, thanks to Perera’s and the rest of the cast and crew’s efforts, the production found the very success that Rose continuously sought for her children and herself. For Harvard College Musical Theater’s first ever production, everything came up roses, indeed.

In 1995, Jay Heinrichs published a piece in Harvard Magazine titled “How Harvard Destroyed Rhetoric.” The article criticized Harvard’s undergraduate curriculum, which “doesn’t offer a single course in which oratorical theory and practice are taught together.” Today, such a course exists—Expository Writing 40: “Public Speaking Practicum,” though it’s the only spoken rhetoric class in the undergraduate curriculum. Marcus K. Granderson ’18, who designed his own concentration, Rhetoric, had to commute to MIT last year to take his introductory rhetoric class because Harvard didn’t offer one.
Even at a liberal arts college with a broad range of course offerings, the place of studying rhetoric in the undergraduate education remains uncertain. Some students and professors view speaking as a skill crucial to any sort of career, while others see it as a creative outlet and type of performance. Still others value rhetoric as a way of enhancing and enriching human communication. Although some argue that advanced technologies and social media are beginning to replace face-to-face conversation, many students at Harvard still see the ancient art form of spoken rhetoric as worth pursuing, both inside and outside the classroom.
Expos 40 may be an anomaly in the undergraduate course catalogue, but at the Kennedy School, the Business School, and the Graduate School of Education, rhetoric courses are much more available. One such course, on offer at all three schools, is “The Arts of Communication.” Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, an Adjunct Lecturer on public policy at the Kennedy School, teaches six sections of the course this semester. “It’s a course that seeks to introduce students to the arts of communication and public speaking, and some writing, and a little media training as well, but it’s mostly based on public oratory,” he said.
The title of the course itself implies that spoken rhetoric has an artistic side to it. “Public speaking is by nature performative. You move, you use your voice, you use your body, you try to connect with people in different ways, you make eye contact, you master a script, you use language,” he said.
So what is spoken rhetoric anyway? An art? A practical skill? Steven D. Cohen, who holds a faculty appointment at the Harvard Extension School, where he teaches “Oral Communication In the Workplace,” splits spoken rhetoric into two components.
“On a basic level, there’s what you say and how you say it. But what I write about is the music beneath the words,” Cohen said. Vocal performances have a clear connection to spoken rhetoric, but Cohen said that even music without lyrics can provide models for speaking.“There are elements that both speakers and musicians use: tempo, dynamics, pitch, for instance. And a couple of my research articles look at the technique that composers use to create beautiful pieces of classical music, and the techniques that leaders use to create memorable moments,” he said. “So my central argument is that we ought not just consider the words that speakers use, but the music they use to coat those words.”
In some contexts, such as spoken word poetry, rhetoric is essential to the art form itself. Ryan F. Boyland ’17 is a member of Speak Out Loud, a spoken word poetry group on campus, and also performs on his own. Just as Cohen makes a distinction between the words and the way that they’re spoken, Boyland also articulates the difference between the written and performed versions of his poems.
“I perform for others, but I write for myself,” he said. “I perform because I want people to feel something, that’s the goal. I write because I like to write. I feel like it helps me figure out the way that I’m thinking, my emotions.”
Boyland said that he uses his techniques of speaking as a way to respond in real time to the reactions of his audiences. He echoes Cohen in his sense of the musicality inherent in spoken word.
“I’m not that great of a writer. People like the way that I say things,” Boyland said. “I feel like with my stuff, not necessarily with everyone, a lot of the message is found in the way that things are said. Just with the emotions, the pauses, or the lack thereof, all of that together.”
Boyland emphasizes that music and rhetoric not only sound similar, but also share a broader communicative purpose. “I feel like music and poetry and spoken word are all just different types of storytelling, different ways to convey your ideas,” Boyland said.
At the heart of it, these students and professors see rhetoric as a means of creative expression. “As human beings, we’re hardwired to be social creatures,” McCarthy said, “We seek to be understood.”
Amanda N. Dias-Jayasinghe ’17, who took Expos 40 last fall, sees the connection between public speaking and the deeper messages that music conveys. “Music is all about the words, but there’s something about the rhythm, the instruments, that conveys the sense that it’s happiness, or it’s hope. And that’s the same with public speaking. You can tell a story, just as you can with a novel, with a painting. It’s not just you that’s experiencing it, it’s your whole audience. It’s an art form in the sense that you are trying to reach a human being, because those human beings are right in front of you.”
Instructors in rhetoric echo the idea that the interpersonal aspect, the idea of connecting to the audience, is crucial to spoken rhetoric. David S. Carter, currently one of the three preceptors for Expos 40, said that speaking is as much a craft as other forms of art. Expos 40 focuses on improving public speaking skills through practice and cultivating an understanding of communication itself. In addition to delivering three speeches throughout the semester, students practice impromptu speaking, analyze famous speeches, and write their own. “I think because our class is a practicum, we practice the craft. If you want to call it an art, it certainly can get in the poetic,” he said. “We practice the craft of gauging an audience, which is artistic.”
Though the music of the words may very well define spoken rhetoric as an art, students and faculty also note rhetoric’s practicality and pre-professional purposes. Cole S. Scanlon ’18, a previous student of Expos 40, sees spoken rhetoric as almost universally useful. “Public speaking is such an everyday skill,” he said.
Paul Lisker ’17, another former student of Expos 40, said that students in almost any field need public speaking skills to prepare themselves for life after college. “I think that being an effective speaker is sort of essential for most careers that people take, certainly many of the careers that people in Harvard are interested in in particular. If you’re going into finance, or science, or government, any of these professions will require public speaking,” he said.
Other students say that they’ve seen the gap in their education when they leave Harvard to pursue jobs and internships. Dias-Jayasinghe recalls a public speaking opportunity at her internship last summer at Wal-Mart as the “most embarrassing moment of my life.”
“I was asked to M.C. a Wal-Mart quarterly meeting,” she said. “So I was in front of all these executives, thousands of people, and I completely froze on speech.”
Dias-Jayasinghe knew that public speaking was a skill that she wanted to work on. In fact, she’d been trying to lottery into Expos 40 since the second semester of her freshman year. Since Expos 40 is the only rhetoric class at the college, however, and she was not chosen for the lottery until after this internship, Dias-Jayasinghe had had little opportunity to practice her spoken rhetoric in a classroom setting before she had to give her presentation.
Dias-Jayasinghe is not alone in her experience with Expos 40’s lottery process. In fact, over 200 students get turned away from the class each semester.
“Expos 40 is a lottery class,” Carter said. “We have between 250 and 300 students each semester who want to apply, who do apply. But we can only choose five sections, no more than 70 or 80 people.”
Students who have taken the class see its value as part of the undergraduate education, but are split on the issue of whether such a rhetoric class should be required. Currently, all undergraduates are required to take Expos 20, an expository writing course. But Expos 40 is purely elective and does not currently fulfill a General Education requirement.
“I think that Expos 20 should definitely be required. And I think that Expos 40 should be as well, or some kind of public speaking class,” Lisker said.
Granderson, who designed his own concentration in rhetoric, thinks that it should be an integral part to every undergraduate’s education. “Every college student should be required to take at least one rhetoric class, I can’t stress how important that is,” he said.
Dias-Jayasinghe agrees. “I wish there were more options for courses,” she said.
Scanlon said that he felt similarly. “I think Harvard should do a better job at encouraging public speaking, be it offering more classes [or] expanding the Expos 40 sections,” he said.
However, Scanlon does not think that Expos 40 should be a required course. “I’m very con requirements, generally,” he said. “I think the fact that so many people are lotterying for it speaks to its value, and that that’s enough to cause a lot of people to enroll in it, which already happens, but I don’t think it needs to be a requirement. Because I think there are cases in which people might not want to do it or whatever else.”
Professor Jeffrey L. Seglin, who is the director of the Communications Program at the Kennedy School, does not believe that requiring Expos 40 would be a positive change in the curriculum. “Anytime you make something a requirement it results in resentment,” he said. “But I think the skills that we teach are those that anyone graduating from college should have.”
Instead, he said that the college could offer a set of courses from which students could choose and make it a requirement that the students take at least one of those courses.
For Granderson, however, just one class wasn’t enough. He started out thinking about a government concentration, but then realized that didn’t fit his interests completely. In high school, his first introduction to the academic side of rhetoric was in his AP Language class. He also participated in debate in high school, which he said wasn’t as artistically fulfilling as what he was looking for.
“The power of rhetoric in American history, thinking about Martin Luther King, and Frederick Douglass, Shirley Chisholm, Sojourner Truth, all these different powerful orators who have moved the needle of history by their words, it was just really attractive to me,” he said.
Since Granderson had to create his own curriculum and set of courses to take, he did some research online and looked to other schools for inspiration. “Berkeley actually has this program, an extensive rhetoric program. I looked at how they constructed it, their concentration, and I drew upon it. They were looking at film, looking at literature, looking at poetry, looking at rhetoric in all of these mediums, to give a multidisciplinary approach to rhetoric,” he said. “So I tried to do the same in my concentration, tweaking it more to my interests.” He added that he sees rhetoric as inherently linked to many different areas of a liberal arts curriculum. “Rhetoric is a multi-disciplinary idea to me,” he said.
Among the classes that he included in his own curriculum are rhetoric classes at MIT, because there were no specific “rhetoric” classes offered for undergraduates when Granderson made the concentration. Instead, he’s taken classes ranging from psychology to the sciences. “Science is one [subject] that people don’t necessarily associate with rhetoric, but I took a class on climate and talking about how we frame climate change can change how people perceive it,” Granderson said.
To Granderson, rhetoric is as valuable as any other liberal arts program offered for undergraduates at Harvard. “Harvard is always talking about how it’s training future world leaders, but what if those future world leaders don’t understand how to talk about well-reasoned, well-thought out ethical arguments, and also [don’t understand] the rhetoric that is coming at them?” he said.
Extension School Professor Cohen believes that teaching rhetoric aligns with the values of Harvard. “Harvard is all about creating leadership. And the way to create leadership, the way to get undergraduates out there, is to not just learn about the art of communication, but also the science of communication,” he said.
While some liberal arts schools, such as Seglin’s alma mater Emerson College, require an oral communication class, many American universities today do not include rhetoric among their core offerings. Cohen said that Harvard has the chance to be one of the first to do so. “It’s about doing something that the Ivy League hasn’t yet tackled. It’s about making communications part of the core curriculum. It will differentiate Harvard, it will make us stand out,” he said. “It will send a signal to the world that we’re not only a place where we breed leaders, but we’re a place where we give leaders the skills we need to achieve their goals.”
Michael D. Smith, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Robin Kelsey, Dean of Arts and Humanities, did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
From a political perspective, McCarthy also emphasizes the importance of rhetoric skills for students interested in becoming successful leaders.
“Many people are increasingly coming to understand that one has to be an effective communicator in order to be an effective leader and to have any kind of success in public life requires you have to have fairly advanced and even sophisticated skills,” he said. “You have to be able to write well, speak well, you have to be able to communicate through the media, you need to be able to code-switch in different settings with different audiences.”
In the current political climate, students are recognizing rhetoric not only as a classical art, but as one that renders political discourse dynamic and subjective. Lisker, for instance, compared President Donald Trump’s ways of speaking to pointillism, an artistic style that was controversial and idely criticized when it first appeared. “Donald Trump’s rhetoric, I don’t think it’s a very typical type of art, but it’s subjective and could also be characterized as a distinct school of art,” he said.
Some even see rhetoric as deceptive, as putting content in a more attractive package. Seglin, Director of the Kennedy School’s Communications Program, emphasizes the necessity of quality content as well as persuasive rhetoric.
“I’d much rather deal with someone who has content and has rough edges, than deal with someone who has nothing to say,” he said. “It’s easy for me to help someone become a better writer if they have something to say. What’s really challenging is if someone’s gifted or charismatic but has no meat, and there’s nothing really there.”
As media of communication evolve, so does rhetoric. McCarthy recognizes that changes in the way we communicate pose challenges to some of the classical techniques of rhetoric that Aristotle posed. “Aristotle never would’ve imagined a tweeting Trump,” McCarthy said. “But in fact, Aristotle is deeply relevant in the twenty-first century because he laid out a practice of rhetoric and a structure of rhetoric that is very much still alive and well today.”
Expos 40 preceptor Carter said that he believes that perfecting spoken rhetoric requires students to be less dependent on electronic forms of communication. While he recognizes that students juggle often not one, but multiple smart devices, he says that he asks students to step away from them in the classroom. “It’s the elephant in the room, in one respect,” Carter said. “I do say that you don’t need your laptops, we ask you not to use your laptops in class, because it’s a very practical, interactive, experiential course. The experience is to interact with each other on a verbal level to get that practice. To take people away from the texting and typing.”
Granderson said he thinks that technology has the potential to erode the very basis of traditional rhetoric. “I think that social media, that whole 140-character, short prose, is killing rhetoric,” he said. “Rhetoric to me is about long, sustained, well-crafted, multi-point arguments that bring together poetry and different philosophical ideas and different novels in literature and all these ideas to make well-reasoned and well-thought out, artistic arguments”
Yet for some, new technologies herald new forms of rhetoric rather than its disappearance from social life. “I think rhetoric has evolved, as many art forms do. Some people think that the art of writing is lost, because people don’t write letters anymore. I don’t think it’s being lost, it’s just different from what it used to be,” Lisker said. “There’s a certain beauty to the evolution of art. You can’t let art stagnate. I don’t think rhetoric is stagnating, it’s evolving, and I think it’s really exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Philanthrocapitalism is the new buzz word on campus. It makes sense, as when presented with the options of either getting rich or being a good person arise, it’s difficult not to answer, uh, both. After the term was coined in 2006 by The Economist as the effort to make philanthropy look more like for-profit capital markets, some rising stars in the field were Bill Gates, who made his own charitable foundation tackling problems with global health, as well as Mark Zuckerberg, who promised to donate 99% of his profits from Facebook to charity and who has already donated millions of dollars to the Newark public school system. They’re not old leaders conquering new regimes; they’re innovators reshaping how the public sector works, rectifying the inefficiencies that really plague how well-intentioned, but antiquated, social programs work. They are social investors, venture philanthropists, and good maximizers—the real superstars. Philanthrocapitalism is a fancy, novel, academic way for the bourgeoisie to be good too. And don’t we all have the right, the freedom, to be good, the way we want to be, regardless of what we want to do? I didn’t think so either.
The term “philanthrocapitalism,” like “intersectionality” and “phenomenology,” is an academized rebranding of a concept that was originally so basic to society there was no need for the term in the first place. When people first started accumulating currency in mountains during the Gilded Age, Andrew Carnegie, one of the first millionaires, stated, “I resolved to stop accumulating and begin the infinitely more serious and difficult task of wise distribution.” Even the first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller, donated to health initiatives, the education of African Americans, and the relief of chronic poverty in the South. The primary instinct of those with more money than they know what to do with is to give it to someone else. Therefore, the rebranding of such people today as the “social investors of philanthrocapitalism” is a complication that does not need to occur, since it is rooted in basic human nature to remedy excess with charity.
But I want to look past philanthrocapitalism’s unoriginality and to the paradoxes of its function. It works in two ways: first and simplest, the dumping of huge sums of money made from the private sector into a cause, and second, the using of capitalistic strategies to gain money for the public sector. What stands out as irreconcilable is that many of the incentives for charity occur because of capitalist ignorance: the results of the commodification of healthcare and education; rising inequities between socioeconomic and racial classes; environmental externalities occurring because of competition between industries; forced and exploited global labor in a rush to produce cheaply, efficiently, succinctly; the tendency of a consumption driven society to disregard its lowest echelons of our homeless, prisoners, and poor. This list is not a critique of capitalism but an acknowledgment of the social cost occurring from massive benefits of our economic system; if we were, instead, driven by a socialist system, we would have a new set of spoils, equally compelling and equally difficult. Philanthrocapitalism is an attempt to direct the social system towards these efforts, while charity is an effort to aid those left behind by our social system. But you can’t fix a broken leg by walking on it. An attempt to aid those abandoned by capitalism by exploiting it even further seems counterintuitive because it is.
Furthermore, even if there was no logical fallacy in philanthrocapitalism’s function, pouring money into supposedly ineffectual organizations that can’t get the money themselves, is probably one of the worst ways to either rally for social change or minimize the economic waste that capitalists despise. Let’s assume the assumption of many ideological defenders of philanthrocapitalism—that the public sector needs the private sector because they are too inefficient in garnering the money themselves. And maybe this assumption is correct, as many of Zuckerberg’s millions donated to Newark public schools reportedly were eaten up by “bureaucratic inefficiencies.” Grapes without a winery are rotten, and unproductive organizations are wasteful. Even the rudimentary macroeconomic Solow model states that firms can’t maintain their capital stocks if they don’t have the tools necessary for their upkeep. Philanthrocapitalists focus very little on changing an organization’s structural mechanism for approaching the actual social problem, and instead, work on money. When elite students choose to swarm into the private sector, justifying their understandably selfish occupational choices with a promise that they will one day give back financially, they evade the obvious, that our society needs people, brainpower, and efficient social organization over money, which is already physically meaningless, and even more meaningless when not applied correctly. That they evade the quality of direct, active, innovative citizenship our university has given them the chance to attain through education, access, and status. And yes, that evasion is also wasted capital.
But even if the reality of massive monetary waste is not compelling, what do we do when the leaders of our markets are also the leaders of our social systems? Why would we let the same enterprising superstars of our markets, who have way too much status to connect to the general population and who are obviously not abandoned by the capitalist system, also choose which projects in our society are worthy of receiving money/attention? What is the point of constructing a society where the same individuals have power over the private sector and thus the public sector and thus the government? Doesn’t that seem remarkably undemocratic?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst ongoing, contentious debate over the introduction of sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations at Harvard, Alpha Epsilon Pi, formerly an all-male fraternity, has become the first Greek organization to announce a transition to become a gender neutral social group. We applaud their decision and subsequent statement for its nuanced, thoughtful approach to what has become a deeply divisive new policy. This is no small decision; Harvard's Eta Psi chapter of AEPi will be forced to disaffiliate from its national organizing body once it begins accepting non-male members. We commend the Eta Psi chapter’s demonstrated willingness to work with the  sanctions, as well as their efforts to reflect on what makes their community a valuable addition to campus.
The statement issued by the Eta Psi chapter reflects a careful thought process on the transition to gender neutrality, and their realization that remaining all-male is an unnecessary requirement of remaining a “supportive and welcoming community”. We hope that other single-gender social clubs, especially the remaining Greek organizations, think carefully about Eta Psi’s statement and discuss whether remaining all-male or all-female is a defining and integral part of their collective identity. While we do not believe that there is an easy answer to this question, we do believe that Eta Psi’s example proves that it is possible for a social organization to open its doors to other genders without losing its essential values—in fact, such a decision may enhance important values of respect, diversity, and community.
However, we also acknowledge that a surface-level transition to a gender neutral rush or punch process does not inherently make a single-gender space inclusive. While AEPi’s statement indicates a desire to be truly committed to becoming gender neutral, other social clubs may be less enthusiastic about the change. In order to become a gender neutral, accepting social space, actions must speak louder than words.
We call upon the members of Eta Psi and other groups adapting to the College’s new sanction policy to ensure that their selection process produces a membership that is representative of the College along axes not limited to gender, like class and ethnicity. In particular, we urge final clubs going co-ed to commit to their decision on a cultural level, putting careful thought into how new members can feel welcomed, respected, and valued, rather than tokens mandated by College policy.
The sanctions take effect once the Class of 2021 arrives on campus next fall, and we also ask Harvard to trust its student organizations to follow through on public statements of gender neutrality. Were organizations to be asked to publish group demographics, it would be a paternalistic requirement that is unnecessarily invasive.
Furthermore, we urge the College to allow Eta Psi and its members, as a traditionally Jewish fraternity, to continue to identify with a particular religious background, allowing that identity to inform their mission and role on campus. While we believe that social organizations should reflect the overall diversity of campus, we also acknowledge their important role in building community among adherents of the same religion, or members of the same ethnic minority. This role should be protected as long as such groups adhere to anti-discriminatory policies and allow other interested students admittance. The publication of demographic reports may hinder the ability of these clubs to foster particular cultural identities, and we thus urge the College to carefully consider how it will implement these reports.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a week ago, 1,118 students from around the nation and the world received a coveted letter of acceptance from our very own Harvard College. Joining their Early Action peers, as many as 2,056 students will arrive in Cambridge next fall for the 381st year in this storied institution’s history.
At some point in the whirlwind of Opening Days, they will all gather together and sit shoulder to shoulder in Sanders Theatre―prep school alumni next to public school graduates, urban New Yorkers besides middle-of-nowhere Alaskans, students hailing from Boston, Bosnia, and everywhere in between. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will advise them to make the most of the wealth of opportunities that have just opened before them. As we’ve all heard again and again, he will tell them to seek out a “transformative experience” during their brief time here.
But for many, it’s not so simple. 15.1 percent of these students will be the first in their families to go to college. Roughly one fifth will have come from low-income families. Others will be among the first from their high school to attend such an institution.
For these students, the very first step onto a campus of such prevalent wealth, privilege, and entitlement represents a drastic change from their pre-college lives. Simply surviving is already incredibly challenging, but pursuing Dean Khurana’s “transformative experience” would require a level of support that, as evidenced by the recent rejection of a bridge program, the administration seems unwilling to commit to.
On his website, Khurana elaborates on his goal: “We want to ensure that we are providing students with a deeply transformative experience―intellectually, socially and personally―that will prepare them for a life of citizenship and leadership.” Yet, Khurana’s three realms of transformation―intellectual, social, and personal―are difficult to achieve given the additional obstacles faced by underprivileged students.
Harvard is academically rigorous for all, but a student’s high school can make a massive difference in their preparedness for this challenge. For example, students from public schools that offer few AP or advanced classes immediately find themselves behind prep school peers who are able to pursue upper-level classes in their first semester. This is just one of the many advantages that feeder schools give over students from high schools that didn’t expect them to go to college.
In terms of social transformation, the sudden exposure to the massive and highly-visible wealth that exists at Harvard creates tension. It is impossible to ignore the disparities that arise when 15.1 percent of the student body comes from the socioeconomic top 1 percent―families that make over $630,000 a year. Even when personalities are compatible, it can be difficult to feel a sense of similarity when one student’s Canada Goose jacket costs just as much as another’s entire wardrobe. These boundaries are reinforced by numerous social spaces on campus that, while more open today than ever before, are nevertheless built on a foundation of wealth, legacy, and social status.
Finally, various burdens make it difficult for students to focus on personal growth. Pressure to preserve high grade point averages in order to maintain any outside scholarships adds stress in an already intense environment. Even as attending Harvard creates new relationships, it can also produce serious feelings of separation from one’s home community. It’s easy to feel disassociated from a poor hometown and from unemployed high school peers as one begins to experience and observe previously unfathomable levels of privilege.
Most, if not all, of us question the legitimacy of our acceptance letter at some point. When 95 percent are declined, it’s natural to wonder what actually sets you apart. But at the same time, it’s necessary to acknowledge that for some students, these feelings of “not belonging” are rooted in reality―historical exclusion, structural boundaries, and educational disadvantages. And these worries are not unfounded: the Education Advisory Board reported that, nationally, as many as 90 percent of low-income, first-gen students do not graduate on time.
Harvard has made an incredible effort to accept students from a range of backgrounds, especially those who have had more challenging paths to this point―to abandon them once they arrive is hypocritical, irresponsible, and disrespectful. Without a doubt, Dean Khurana’s goal of giving students a transformative experience during their years in Cambridge is admirable. But the administration must acknowledge that some face additional obstacles. And while the College need not guarantee the result, it must ensure every student an equal opportunity. Because when even the first step feels too high, climbing to the top is impossible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former United Nations Secretary-General and Kennedy School alumnus Ban Ki-Moon will be returning to campus this month as the third Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellow, the school announced on Thursday.
Ban, who served two terms as Secretary-General of the UN from 2007 through 2016, had recently returned to his native South Korea and was reportedly contemplating a presidential bid.
His decision to come to Harvard for the remainder of the spring semester comes after he announced on Feb. 1 that he would not be running.
In an interview Wednesday, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said that Ban will be actively engaging with both students and faculty at the Kennedy School during his time at Harvard.
“He won’t be teaching a regular course, because the semester is well underway and visiting fellows don’t teach regular courses,” Elmendorf said. “But he will be participating in a number of classes, talking with our faculty members, spending time with other visitors to the school, and meeting with students.”
“He’s coming because he wants to dive into the rich environment of the school, and we’re delighted that he’ll be coming to do that,” Elmendorf added.
In a press release announcing the fellowship, Ban said that he looks forward to returning to the Kennedy School, where he has “very fond memories” of his time as a student.
“The Fellowship will be a wonderful opportunity for me to reflect upon my years in public service, to connect with scholars and students throughout the Harvard community, and to continue my work on the important public policy issues I remain very passionate about,” he added.
The fellowship is reserved for “high-profile leaders who are transitioning out of public office or other leadership positions,” according to the press release. Former President of Finland Tarja Halonen and former President of Mexico Felipe Calderón had previously been selected for the fellowship.
“We’re so lucky at the Kennedy School that distinguished public leaders like Ban Ki-Moon want to come and talk with students and faculty of the school, because these leaders bring understanding of the forces in the world that affect societies,” Elmendorf said.
“That perspective of distinguished practitioners is a perfect complement to the perspective of distinguished scholars on our campus,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A renovated space for the Office of BGLTQ Student Life in the basement of Grays Hall—featuring a kitchen, lounge, and library—will open by mid-October, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
Construction on the space, which will be shared with the College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, will begin in June. Staffers at the office say they hope to use the new site to better welcome and host all undergraduates.
BGLTQ Student Life Director Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 called construction of the new office a “really wonderful moment for Harvard College.” He said he hopes to host College-wide social events in the Harvard Yard space once construction is finished.
“[The College has] invested so much in this space, and now we get to be the ones to use it and make it the best that it can possibly be,” Scarborough said, adding that his office and the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion are “going to make great neighbors.”
Others said they are excited that the BGLTQ office will be located at a more central spot on campus, closer to its former location in the basement of Boylston Hall. The office is currently housed at 7 Linden St., along with the College’s Bureau of Study Counsel.
“One of the things that was nice about the location prior to Linden St., the location that was in Boylston, was that it was a little bit more informal,” said Lispeth J. Tibbits-Nutt, a specialty BGLTQ freshman proctor. “Students were more likely to just stop by and hang out.”
Patric C. W. Verrone ’18, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, also said he hopes the Grays location will be more convenient for students.
“I think that the space we are at now, while we like it and enjoy being in that space at 7 Linden St., it’s not really accessible,” he said.
Verrone added that the thinks the new space is at “the historical and ideological center of campus.”
In a speech last month celebrating the office’s fifth anniversary at Harvard, Scarborough again voiced excitement about the new location, and said he sees the move as an opportunity to welcome all students, regardless of their identities.
“There’s a lot to look forward to,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the heads of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate Houses unanimously agreed to abandon the title “House Master” in December 2015, some said the revision was overdue.
“There’s no sense in putting this off any longer,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said at the time.
“There was a sense that the time had come,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana agreed.
Administrators decided to abandon the term “House Master” in part because some students criticized the name for its association with slavery, and because the term had come under national scrutiny as debates about racism roiled college campuses across the country. Roughly three months later, Smith announced that former “House Masters” would now be called “Faculty Deans.”
But over a year later, the words “House Master” still adorn the doors of some Faculty Deans’ residences, parking signs for their cars, and emails sent by at least one Faculty Dean. And at Harvard Law School, efforts to remove the school's seal, which was criticized for its ties to slavery, have been similarly difficult.
Today, parking signs for spaces belonging to the Faculty Deans of Eliot House, Leverett House, and Pforzheimer House still display the "House Master" title. The gate leading to the Eliot Faculty Deans’ residence bears the words “Eliot House Master’s Residence,” and a small golden plaque on the front door of the Lowell House Faculty Dean’s house reads “Master’s Residence.” The same title is printed in large, black block letters spread across the door to the Pforzheimer Faculty Deans’ apartment.
Until Thursday morning, Eliot’s website referred to Faculty Deans Douglas A. Melton and Gail A. O’Keefe as “House Masters.”
And in an email sent over Quincy’s House listserv Wednesday night,  Quincy House Faculty Dean Deborah J. Gehrke signed her name “Deborah Gehrke, Co-Master, Quincy House.”
House staff are responsible for updating and maintaining House websites, and House and building administrators are in charge of signage for each residential complex. Since the roll-out of the new title, Faculty Deans for at least three Houses—Cabot, Mather, and Kirkland—have altered signs on their residences to read “Faculty Deans.”
After being contacted by The Crimson Thursday, O’Keefe updated the Eliot House website’s personnel page to read “Faculty Deans.” All other House websites already used the term as of Thursday morning.
“Our title on the website was simply an oversight, and is now corrected,” O’Keefe wrote in an emailed statement Thursday. “We may appear late to the game in changing that, but frankly we don’t update the website often enough!”
O’Keefe added that she and Melton commissioned a new sign for the entrance to their residence, and wrote they plan to hang the updated sign after replacing the gate itself.
Pforzheimer Faculty Dean Anne Harrington ’82 wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that she is aware the sign for her parking space still reads “House Master.” She added that Parking Services and Transportation is responsible for making changes to official parking signs, and that she is unaware whether the group has any “update on their plans for this task.”
But she wrote that the Pforzheimer Building Manager will be replacing the sign on the door to the House’s Faculty Deans’ Residence on Friday.
“As coincidence would have it, our Building Manager told us that our long-ago ordered new sign arrived today and will be installed tomorrow,” Harrington wrote on Thursday evening. “It should look very nice.”
Faculty Deans for Lowell, Leverett, and Quincy did not respond to requests for comment.
In March 2016, the Law School also took steps to address its historical ties to slavery—specifically, the Law School recommended discarding its former seal featuring the crest of the Royall family, slave-owners who endowed the school’s first professorship in the late 18th century. In the days following that decision, the Law School sought to physically remove all traces of the Royall crest from its campus and website.
But as of Thursday evening, the seal still lingered in certain corners of the Law School campus, featured on some recycling bins and on computer screens in Langdell Hall.
After being contacted by The Crimson, Law School Dean for Administration Francis X. McCrossan wrote in an email that he was aware the school’s “large-scale” effort to remove the seal last year may not have been entirely successful.
“We did away with the shield in all the places where we found it, but occasionally we still come across instances that weren't caught during that review,” McCrossan wrote. “We welcome hearing about uses or places where it still shows up, so we can remove it.”
The Law School has yet to announce its plans for the replacement of the shield, but McCrossan wrote that the school’s bicentennial, happening this year, forms an opportunity to choose a new seal.
“We expect to decide upon a process for selecting a new design during the celebratory year ahead, and to then seek review and approval from the Harvard Corporation,” McCrossan wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the end of a National Labor Relations Board hearing that could decide the fate of student unionization at Harvard came to a close, the University and union organizers filed briefs this week again advancing their respective arguments.
The briefs come after a weeks-long hearing in Boston, in which parties presented arguments to the NLRB. After reviewing the briefs, Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr. will consult with Hearing Officer Thomas A. Miller and make a decision about the validity of the unionization election that took place in November. If the NLRB agrees with arguments made in the union’s brief, it could call for a re-vote.
The briefs address two main issues: challenged ballots and allegations of an unfair election.
In November, eligible students voted on whether or not to form a union. An initial December vote count found that more students had voted against unionization than for it, but the margin of victory was smaller than the number of challenged ballots—votes from students whose eligibility was disputed. 
Apart from challenged ballots, both sides filed objections with the NLRB over the list of eligible voters in the November election.
In its brief, Harvard argued the NLRB should not agree with the union’s objections and should not count the challenged ballots.
“Harvard Graduate Student Union-UAW...has failed to meet its heavy burden seeking to undo a validly conducted election which the [union] lost,” the brief reads. “For these reasons, the Hearing Officer should conclude that the remaining challenged ballots be discarded and reject the Union’s entreaty to disregard the vote of nearly 3,000 Harvard students and order a new election.”
In support of Harvard’s arguments, lawyers for the University argued that Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students received sufficient advance notice of the election. They also argued that the number of voters on Harvard’s eligible list of voters was not significantly smaller than the voter list the union had proposed to the NLRB.
The union, on the other hand, argued that the NLRB should count the remaining challenged ballots, including those of first year students from the department of Organismic and Environmental Biology and Teaching Assistants at the Graduate School of Design, two groups of voters whose eligibility was disputed during NLRB hearings.
Lawyers for the union argued that if the challenged ballots did not change the outcome of the election the NLRB should call for a re-vote because they believe the first election was unfair.
"In light of the substantial number of omissions from Harvard's voter list, the determinative nature of those omissions, and the inadequacy of Harvard's efforts to compile a complete and accurate list, the Union's objection should be sustained," the union’s objection reads.
The hearing ended on March 17 and parties had until April 3 to file their post-hearing briefs.

Amid a nationwide debate about the status of free speech on college campuses, a new undergraduate group has vowed to “test” the limits of those values and invite what some say are hateful speakers to campus.
Recently formed, the Open Campus Initiative espouses “support for freedom of thought, speech and association.” So far, the group has invited widely criticized right-wing speakers to campus, though its president Conor Healy ’19 said they hope to host liberal speakers as well.
Jordan Peterson, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto who claims that gender nonconformity threatens free speech, will come to campus next week.
The group has also invited Charles A. Murray ’65, a conservative political scientist who has drawn criticism for his work alleging intellectual inequality among racial groups, to speak in the fall. Murray drew national attention earlier this year when a campus protest at Middlebury College disrupted his speaking appearance there and briefly turned violent.
Healy said the group values First Amendment principles.
“We’re a group on campus that expresses support for freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of association.  We think one of the great ways of doing, or rather promoting that on campus is by holding speaking events that other groups are unwilling to have,” Healy said.
Already, though, students have started to criticize the Open Campus Initiative and its choice to invite Peterson to speak at Harvard, arguing that giving a platform to his stances constitutes hate speech.
“If you substituted any other protected class of people for the trans people he’s talking about, it would be appalling, and the only reason it’s not appaling is because we allow violence against trans people to be normalized,” Lily M. Velona ’18 said.
Peterson has publicly stated that he will not use pronouns other than “he” and “she” and actively opposes Canada Bill C-16, which aims to extend the Canadian Human Rights Code to protect people from discrimination on the basis of “gender identity and gender orientation.”
Helene Lovett ’19 is organizing a group of students to create a response against the event, and although the group has not finalized any plans, they felt the event crossed a line.
“Personally I think a ‘shut it down’ attitude is just going to play right into this rhetoric, but I want to call this out, it’s completely unacceptable,” Lovett said.
After Peterson spoke at University of Toronto campus in October, several transgender and black students reported receiving threatening and hateful messages, which both Lovett and Velona said worries them.
“When you’re inciting violence, whether intentional or not, it’s not just an intellectual debate anymore,” Lovett said.
Healy said the group invited Peterson and Murray because they are both academics with “something to contribute,” adding that the group looked forward  “to challenge them on some of their more so-called problematic views.”
“Some people see it as stirring the pot. I mean, the very fact that people see it that was is part of the reason why we these events are important, because we have fundamental disagreements, I suppose, with a lot of people about what it means to be a student on this campus,” Healy said.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, who alleges the College’s penalties on members of single-gender social groups violate students' freedom of association, serves as the faculty adviser to the group. Lewis did not comment on the group’s selection of speakers.
Pointing to a 1990 Faculty of Arts and Sciences resolution to protect the ability of groups to hold speaking events without interruption, Healy said “part of what we’re trying to do as a group is test that commitment that the University made several years ago.”
Velona said they believed that freedom of speech was one thing and debating transgender people’s humanity was another.
“It normalizes the idea that trans people are less than other humans; it normalizes the idea that we can refuse to acknowledge the personhood, by putting it up for debate, of an incredibly vulnerable group of people.” Velona said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President of the Republic of Mauritius Ameenah Gurib spoke at the Kennedy School Thursday about the growing Mauritian economy and the threat climate change poses to the island nation.
Gurib detailed the country’s economic growth since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1968. She said the economy has grown and diversified consistently in recent decades.
“The Mauritian economy has diversified massively since independence when we were a mono-crop economy depending on 92 percent sugar in terms of the GDP and per capita income for everybody,” Gurib said. “It started from a very low base and through successive policy decisions, every decade we’ve seen transformation and diversification of the industry.”
Gurib mainly discussed science, technology, and the economies of various African countries during her talk at the John F. Kennedy Jr. forum. A scientist herself, Gurib earned her Ph.D. in organic chemistry at Exeter University in England.
Going forward, Gurib said she is concerned about the impact of rising sea levels and climate change to her country.
“Climate change will definitely impact access to water, and food security could be impacted as well,” Gurib said. “We are not polluters per se, but we need to make sure that we adapt fast… So yes, there is an issue in terms of the economic impact climate change will have.”
Gurib also spoke about Mauritians’ own concerns about climate change, as Mauritius runs the risk of losing land to rising sea levels. Gurib questioned whether Mauritius, as well as the rest of the world, is concerned enough about climate change, which many scientists have said can pose serious threats to humanity and wildlife.
“Are people worried across the world about climate change? Do we take it seriously enough?” Gurib said. “Unfortunately many policy makers don’t seem to take that seriously even though it’s there, we see it. We see for example freak seasons changing, desertification increasing, we see drought, we see flash floods… this is not an easy task because people tend to put that on the backburner, and yet it’s a burning issue.”
When asked about her thoughts on American politics, an amused Gurib declined to comment.
“Technically I can’t say… but I’m saying generally the science community has been raising the alarm for a long, long time,” she said

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 7, 2017, at 1:38 a.m.
CHICAGO — Live by the pipe, die by the pipe.
In 1989, Harvard lived. With an overtime winner in the national championship game against Minnesota, Ed Krayer ’89-90 set a Crimson coronation into motion. One made possible only because Gopher defenseman Randy Skarda’s extra-frame wrister moments earlier was on a collision course with the iron.
“One half-inch, and you’re the champion,” recalled Minnesota coach Doug Woog.
Twenty-eight years later, it’s the Gophers’ rivals to the north providing similar postgame testimony. Only this time, the Minnesotans’ comments came after the NCAA semifinals. And this time, they came from a much happier locker room.
With only 14 seconds remaining and Harvard needing a goal to keep its magical 2016-2017 campaign alive, senior Sean Malone crashed the net and lifted a backhanded rebound over Minnesota-Duluth goaltender Hunter Miska’s right shoulder. But the Bulldogs were saved by the crossbar.
Seconds later, the Crimson cycled the puck over to co-captain Alexander Kerfoot, who made his move down the left faceoff circle before firing a pass to Luke Esposito, stationed halfway down the slot.
With Miska covering more of the right side of his cage, Esposito turned his hips and fired away. But defenseman Nick Wolff had a plan.
“Right when he shot it, my first thought was go down,” Wolff said. “And it hit the top of my knee.”
The shot began rising to chest level, but upon connecting with Wolff’s kneecap, it took off for the rafters. And the puck’s upward trajectory—along with Harvard’s 28-win season—was soon brought to an abrupt halt, once again by the crossbar.
“If it had been one inch lower it would’ve gone bar down,” said Wolff, whose Bulldogs emerged victorious by a 2-1 margin to advance to Saturday’s national championship game against Denver. “We were very fortunate it stayed out.”
“It’s something that I’ll probably never forget as long as I play hockey,” Esposito said. “I’m still in disbelief that it didn’t go in. The whole last 30 seconds, I can’t believe it.”
In a game that was tied for more than 56 minutes, those last 30 seconds were essentially all that separated the two teams on the country’s longest, and second-longest, winning streaks.
And while those 30 seconds ended with iron, they began with twine.
Emerging from a battle of bodies along the boards just inside the Crimson zone, UMD freshman Joey Anderson flung the puck towards the slot from his backhand, spelling a clear and present danger. The feed arrived on the stick of senior defenseman Willie Raskob by the left faceoff circle, creating a 2-on-1 for the Bulldogs (28-6-7, 15-5-4 NCHC). And with UMD’s leading scorer in his sights, Raskob’s best interest was to pass.
One step ahead of Esposito, senior Alex Iafallo received the pass atop the crease and poked the puck through Madsen’s five-hole—off the right pad, then the left—breaking a 41-minute stalemate with only 27 seconds remaining in regulation.
“I tried to slide over and just play the percentages—it’s tough to know where those shots are going to go,” Madsen said. ”He just squeezed it through. Watching the replay, it was the only hole he really had. It just bounced through my pads. I tried to squeeze it together, but it just wasn’t enough.”
Two crossbars later, Iafallo’s 50th point of the season—one that extended his point streak to 14 games—could finally be printed safely on the stat sheet as the final tally in a 2-1 Bulldog victory.
“The end was so sudden,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Everything happened so fast,” Kerfoot added.
Only 14 minutes prior, the Crimson (28-6-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) thought it may have taken the lead. Amid a busy crease, Malone—on the heels of an initial Tyler Moy try—jammed the puck over the goal line, but the official behind the goal immediately signaled no goal. The play was reviewed, but there would be no overturn.
“You know, it looked like the puck was in before he was able to blow the whistle,” Donato said. “The explanation I was given was that there was no audio on the replay. He thought the goalie at one point had it underneath his glove, and in his mind, that's when the play was over.”
“Obviously through my Harvard-colored glasses, it looked like a good goal,” the coach added. “But everybody's trying to do their best out there.”
Within moments of nearly jumping ahead, the Crimson was sent to the defensive. Off a Viktor Dombrovskiy d-zone turnover, UMD assistant captain Karson Kuhlman connected with sophomore center Adam Johnson, who deked his way into space by Madsen’s left post.
But with trouble afoot, the junior goaltender dropped to the ice, stretching his left pad as far as it would go to seal off the pipe. Madsen finished with 36 saves on the night—his second-highest output of the season.
Meanwhile, Harvard launched 40 shots, becoming the first team this season to reach such a total in regulation against the Bulldogs. But only one beat Miska, crossing the line during a Harvard power play.
Moy opened the scoring from his signature spot on the man advantage. Stationed at the bottom of the left circle—right where he grabbed the first goal of the Crimson’s NCAA Tournament run in Providence, R.I.—the Nashville Predators prospect knocked in a feed from Kerfoot to put the Crimson up 1-0.
Harvard has now scored first in 24 of its 36 games, and the Crimson entered Thursday with a 21-2-0 record in such contests. But this time, Harvard’s lead lasted only three minutes and change.
Despite dropping the first-period faceoff battle by a sizable 17-8 margin, the Bulldogs used one of their eight successful draws to pull even with 1:36 left in the frame. After captain Dominic Toninato’s win at the dot, Anderson ripped a shot from the top of the slot that bounced off the stick of Madsen and in.
“It’s just a bounce that we didn’t get tonight,” Madsen said. “If that shot wobbles a little differently, it sticks right on my stick, and I cover it…. It was pretty bizarre for me. I’m sure I looked confused because I was. I couldn’t believe the puck did what it did.”
Madsen hit the nail on the head. And two weeks ago, so did Providence coach—and former Harvard assistant—Nate Leaman. After his Friar team fell to the Crimson in the two sides’ tournament opener, Leaman said that “to win a national championship, you know you’re going to have to get some bounces along the way.”
Thursday night, Harvard didn’t get the bounces. And as a result, a national championship won’t be in the cards. But after a Frozen Four appearance, a 28-win season, and a plethora of championships, the Crimson’s seniors can at least check off one more box.
It’s an accomplishment that’s been important to several straight classes on their way out the door: the Crimson’s seven veterans have left the Harvard jersey in a better spot than where  it was when they arrived.
“It’s easy to say that we’ve done that,” Esposito said. “Harvard Hockey’s definitely back on the map and back where it deserves to be.”

This one's mostly for the freshmen, because all of the upperclassmen have learned this lesson the hard way.
So you still think you're a big shot because you were your high school's valedictorian? Oh cool, so was everyone else here, and they all had a better speech than you, loser.
Sorry to be so harsh, but this is the biting reality of Harvard. Remember that thing that made you special in high school? Someone (and probably more than one person) is objectively better at it here. Yes, this universal truth can be upsetting. It can disappointing and humiliating. Luckily for you, we came to terms with our own inadequacy a long time ago and have a few tricks up our sleeves to help you.
Lie
Say you’re a world class oboe player. Who’s going to call you out? Who even knows what the oboe is?
Develop a new talent 
Learn how to make pottery, play polo, write poetry. Warning: you probably won’t even be average at whatever you try, so most likely not worth it. Risk is not your friend when it comes to dealing with insecurities.
Master something obscure
The more esoteric the talent, the fewer people there are to beat you. So perfect your game of tiddlywinks, practice Irish road bowling, put in the hours on the oboe (actually though, what is an oboe?).
Surround yourself with inferior talent
Miss being the best debater in school? Find friends who have never debated and you can maintain your fantasy. Or go to the nearest preschool—you could really give those children the business in just about anything.
Ambition and success are reserved for the few here, and you’re probably not among them. So in the end, your Harvard experience is really what you make of it. You can drown in your insecurity or be brave, put aside your pride, and accept a new lifestyle of mediocrity.
