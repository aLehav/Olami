After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In his 1909 book “The Great Illusion,” Sir Norman Angell argued that war between Europe’s Great Powers was futile, because their economic interdependence made warfare too costly for all involved. Just five years later, Europe would be plunged into a tragic war that would devastate a whole generation of young men.
Today, the world faces an eerily similar situation in the eastern Pacific Ocean. East Asian economies, buoyed by the rapid growth of China, are flourishing. Trade is booming as old protectionist barriers are thrown down. Yet despite this prosperity, diplomatic relations in the region are increasingly tense.
The Senkaku Islands (known as the Diaoyu Islands in China), a group of islets in the East China Sea, have become the center of an increasingly heated territorial dispute between China and Japan. The islands are barren, uninhabited rocks in the middle of the ocean—yet they could be the fuse in the East Asian powder keg. 
For years, China and Japan have jockeyed over their claims to the islands. In December 2012, China sent a reconnaissance plane over the islands; in response, Japan scrambled F-15 fighter jets. On November 23, 2013, China announced it would begin enforcing an air defense identification zone around its maritime boundaries, which included the Senkaku Islands. Just three days later, the United States flew two B-52 bombers through the zone, sparking Chinese outrage.
In China, Japan’s claim over the islands is seen as a vestige of old imperialist aggression, dating back to the Second Sino-Japanese War. In Japan, China’s claim is seen as a sign of renewed Chinese expansionism. 
At this point, too much rhetorical blood has been spilled—backing down would be politically impossible for either China or Japan, even though war would devastate the economies of both parties. Abe’s nationalist policies appeal to his power base, the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party. China’s foreign ministry, meanwhile, has declared the islands a “core interest;” a concession in this area would be seen as a loss of face.
That’s why a third party, a strong hand with a good diplomatic track record and a vested interest in stability, should enter the situation. In a word, an assertive American foreign policy would help calm the turbulent waters of the East China Sea.
America should caution its ally Japan to tone down the rhetoric. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has damaged relations with China by visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial where 14 Japanese war criminals are buried. A moratorium on such visits would be a good start. Despite rearmament, Japan remains dependent on American military support, and would surely acquiesce to sufficient diplomatic pressure. 
At the same time, China should be sharply rebuked for its increasing displays of militarism. Displays of force, like the B-52 bomber flight, only remind China that it remains militarily outmatched by the United States. In exchange for a cooling of the rhetoric around the Senkaku Islands and a freeze on military escalation around the islands, the United States could privately offer concessions like respecting the rest of the air defense zone and reducing the number of military exercises near China’s maritime borders. 
Once heads have cooled, China and Japan could take their dispute to a neutral third party, like the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Such mediating bodies have a decent track record—Chile and Peru recently negotiated an end to a long-standing maritime dispute through the court.
After the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan, Americans across the political spectrum are surely reluctant to see their nation again entangle itself in foreign affairs. But America is needed abroad; its presence is a vital column in the edifice of international order. And indeed, being assertive in support of international stability does not mean being a warmonger. History bears this out: A strong American military presence in Asia has kept South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan secure, and the U.S. Navy has kept the sea free and open, facilitating the present boom in trade. Even China has much reason to thank the United States, for helping to maintain stability in the countries that are now its major trading partners.
War in Asia would serve no one’s interests—not America’s, not Asia’s, and least of all China’s and Japan’s. By pushing Japan and China into reasoned negotiations and, in a sense, taking the blame from both sides, the United States could allow both countries to back off from this meaningless squabble while saving face. Although the resurgent nationalists in Japan and China would not like to admit it, the United States remains indispensable in Asia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In elementary school, I learned about the kidnapping and enslavement of millions of Africans. I also watched chilling black and white footage of the Civil Rights Movement, where young men and women, beaten and bitten, bruised and bloodied, marched toward freedom.
 
I realize now my teachers blanketed these tales under the guise of distant history. They gave me the false impression that racism in America died after the Civil Rights Movement—that somehow, because there were no longer white-only signs on water fountains, vicious dogs and stinging fire hoses, or black men hanging from trees, my country had vanquished racism forever and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream had become reality.
 
My elementary school view of modern America fell right in line with the post-racial or colorblind narrative that describes the attitude of some Americans today. In the eyes of post-racialists, as long as there are no laws that facially discriminate against certain ethnic groups, discrimination—and racism along with it—doesn’t exist at all. And yet racial discrimination does not have to be overt, nor does it have to be sanctioned by specific laws. If people are systematically treated differently and denied equal opportunities because of the color of their skin, they are being racially discriminated against.
 
Post-racialists may point to the successes of black music artists and athletes, or even our black president, as signs that America has moved beyond its shameful past. But the existence of a few black millionaires does not change the fact that white billionaires continue to control and appropriate black music and own the vast majority of professional sports teams. And as for President Barack Obama, less than half of Americans said in 2011 that they believe he was “definitely born in the US.” This skepticism is something that none of his 42 white predecessors ever had to face.
 
I am unwilling to accept the story that continues to be woven in our public discourse—that these differences, along with disparities in wealth, education, healthcare, housing, criminal convictions and sentences between whites and people of color, are completely due to colorblind factors. This is the post-racial narrative, and it is dead wrong. To say that America is post-racial is to be blind to reality.
 
Black youth are arrested for drug crimes at a rate that is ten times higher than white youth. Black defendants receive harsher punishments for the same crimes committed by white defendants. Some post-racialists may justify these statistics based on the ill-conceived notion that black people are simply more likely to use drugs, ignoring studies indicating that white people are actually more likely to abuse illegal drugs than black people. Legal mistreatment lives.
 
Despite the Supreme Court’s 1954 rejection in Brown v. Board of Education of the doctrine “separate but equal” in education, many public schools continue to be just as segregated (and in some cases more segregated) than they were 40 years ago. This is due to a combination of quiet, discriminative housing practices that keep colored homebuyers out of white communities and the continued use of property taxes to fund the majority of public schools across the nation. With poverty enduring in many communities of color as a result of hundreds of years of legal discrimination, many black and Latino families have no choice but to send their children to the underfunded and low performing schools in their neighborhoods. Separate but equal lives.
 
An invisible, new Jim Crow casts a looming shadow over America. After many of the black and brown children of this country either graduate or drop out from low performing schools, they will be stopped, arrested, convicted, and sentenced at higher rates than the white children who grew up across town. When they are released from prison with felony on their records, they will not be able to vote, employers will refuse to hire them, and the government will be able legally to refuse to give them public benefits. The New Jim Crow lives.
“All men are created equal.” Our nation was founded on these words 238 years ago. But with these words hanging in the balance, America has been the ground for the genocide of its native people, the systematic kidnapping and enslavement of human beings, a legalized caste system that prevented people of color from voting, working, learning, and living with the freedom and dignity that every human being deserves, and today a disguised continuation of that caste system.
 
To deny the existence of America’s race problem is to perpetuate it. The word “slavery” is not once mentioned in the United States Constitution prior to the 13th Amendment. Americans stood idly by, feigning ignorance, as the Southern United States created a system of legal discrimination as bad as slavery for an entire century after emancipation. Today, those who pretend that America is post-racial preserve that legacy of denial.
 
I do not write this to say that America has made no progress. We have made progress. But progress is not enough. We must confront racism to truly move past it, and that begins when those who continue to deny it decide to wake up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On February 1—the beginning of its fiscal year—Harvard Student Agencies raised its minimum wage to $12 per hour, up $2 from the old minimum. HSA employs over 450 students, so the change directly affects many students in low-wage jobs.
 
HSA’s choice to pay its workers more is commendable, especially because it is leading the way and setting an example for other employers to follow. Massachusetts’ minimum wage is currently set at an insufficient $8 per hour, but HSA’s policy gives Harvard students a 50 percent increase over the legal mandate. HSA’s student leaders identified their highly competitive pay as a reason for Harvard students to choose on-campus jobs as opposed to working off-campus. This, however, begs the question of what happens to others, for whom HSA is not an option.
 
A 2012 study found that if the federal minimum wage had kept up with historical inflation and increases in productivity, it would stand at $21.72/hour. This is a far cry from the current federal minimum,  $7.25, which has been left unchanged since 2009. Despite President Barack Obama’s push last November to increase that minimum, consensus for change at a federal level does not seem to be coalescing.
 
Many states have refused to wait for the federal government to act. Twenty-one states and Washington, D.C., set a minimum wage beyond the federal level. Public opinion seems to be on these states’ side: A recent Gallup poll indicated that approximately 76 percent of the population supports raising the minimum wage to at least $9.
 
Although HSA is a non-profit corporation, it—along with Massachusetts and other states that have raised their local minimum wages—can function as a role model for other firms and states. It is important to keep in mind that much of the pressure to keep the minimum wage low comes from large employers. Fast-food chains, many of which are represented at the federal level by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Restaurant Association, have lobbied in Congress against increases. Large corporations should be encouraged by the community to follow HSA’s example and accept wage increases. According to a 2013 poll, a plurality of economists agree that the benefits of a minimum wage increase are significant enough—and the distortionary effects minimal enough—for a $9, inflation-indexed minimum to be a “desirable” policy.
 
Concerns that increasing the wage minimum would negatively impact the economy are largely unfounded. Several new research efforts disprove the old hypothesis that forced wage increase by the federal government will lead to unemployment.
 
It is unfortunate that despite calls from the President as well as a massive public majority, Congress has not established sufficient consensus to set a more livable minimum wage. HSA's decision reflects a need for and the ability of small local populations to make these decisions on their own.

 Last week, Janet Yellen was sworn into one of the most important offices in the land, becoming the new chair of the Federal Reserve. 
 Her first challenge may not be at home but abroad. Around the world, from India to Turkey, currency values have fallen and inflation has skyrocketed. The weak currencies, coupled with lukewarm global recovery, could send the “Fragile Five,” five developing nations with high short term instability (South Africa, Turkey, India, Indonesia, and Brazil), into a death spiral. Yellen will have the power and responsibility to stop that from happening.
 Indeed, Yellen has the ability to strengthen the outlook of multiple currencies at the same time; after all it was her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke ’75, whose action catalyzed the turmoil in the first place. When Bernanke announced plans to cut the Fed’s bond-buying program last year, the yield on dollar-denominated assets rose. Capital, in search of higher yields, abandoned the emerging market currencies and fled back to the United States. The exodus of capital put a downward pressure on these currencies, and sent inflation higher.
 This is not merely a global financial crisis, but also a global political and humanitarian catastrophe. In Turkey, the prime minister accused the “interest rate lobby” of causing civil unrest and lack of growth, but the central bank had no choice but to raise the interest rate to defend the value of the lira. This political concession may lead to more political fragmentation in the fragile democracy. In India, the rupee’s fall contributed to 10 percent inflation last year, mainly in food and energy prices. As the impoverished nation has not yet achieved energy and food security, this crisis could cause millions to lose access to basic food and commodities. Such economic woes would have unthinkable consequences for some of the world’s poorest. 
 To avert these outcomes, Yellen can do much more than merely continue the bond-buying program. This global crisis requires global cooperation among central banks. The crucial position of the Fed in international finance gives Yellen the resources to orchestrate a global defense of weak currencies. After years of running current account deficits, these nations do not have the currency reserves to keep their currency value high. A union of these nations, supported by the Federal Reserve, however, has a much better shot of doing so. The Federal Reserve would emerge as a natural leader in this monetary consortium, replacing the International Monetary Fund as a guardian of global financial stability. As the IMF turns increasingly Euro-centric, this could be a golden opportunity for the Fed to improve its already formidable global standing.
 The Fed’s involvement is likely to have long term impact on the emerging market. In the decade before the financial crisis of 2008, the developing world was on the course of five percent annualized growth, surpassing the developed world’s two percent. The higher growth was accomplished mainly by embracing foreign capital. The newly-arrived foreign capital provided stimulus for local governments to liberalize stagnant sectors and adopt more business- and capital- friendly policies. These policies paid off as long as the capital stayed. As a financial crisis looms for emerging markets, however, this process is currently in danger of rewinding. Many governments have imposed capital control to save their currencies, which will only make matters worse in the long term as investors worry about policy turnaround in the future. If not managed well, this crisis may lead to the withdrawal of multiple emerging markets from the international finance community. It is possible that countries like India and Brazil might look more like China, with strong international commerce but severe capital controls, after the panic. This will be a short-sighted development that makes future international cooperation nearly impossible. As the strong advocate for financial internationalization, the Federal Reserve should assure currency stability in these nations, so that they will focus on the long-run benefits of free capital movement when they make policy decisions.
 Providing short-term support for the most vulnerable foreign currencies will not necessarily go against the Fed’s official mandate of curbing inflation and steering unemployment. Nations with high current account deficits tend to have large demand for international goods. Helping such demand may be a creative way to increase demand for American goods. Supporting foreign markets will also allow speculative capital to find havens of high return elsewhere, rather than creating another asset price bubble in the United States’ low interest rate environment.
 Since Indian central bank governor Raghuram G. Rajan made a case for greater cooperation between policy makers around the world, skeptics have criticized his allegation of victimhood of developing nations at the hands of developed nations. The developing world has embraced global financialization out of self-interest, they say, and their economic policies, not the foreigners, were to blame for the recent crisis. The developed world, therefore, in the words of Dani Rodrik and Arvind Subramanian, has no “obligation to charity."
 The Federal Reserve, obviously, is not an organization for charity. However, as the leading central bank, its policy goals may be more aligned to those of the rest of the world than the “self-interest” mantra suggests. It is in the Fed’s interest and responsibility to create and lead a cooperative environment for international finance. The Federal Reserve should intervene in foreign currency markets not because it is obliged to, but because it—and only it—can.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to sustain and strengthen alumni networks, HarvardX—the University’s branch of the online learning venture edX—will offer course content restricted to alumni beginning in March of this year.
The new program, called “HarvardX for Alumni,” was announced this weekend at the University’s annual Alumni Leadership Conference. The program will draw from pre-existing HarvardX courses such as CB22x: “The Ancient Greek Hero” and MCB80x: “Fundamentals of Neuroscience,” while adding new features such as forums for local Harvard Clubs and Shared Interest Groups as well as live chats with faculty, according to Robert A. Lue, the faculty director of HarvardX.
“One thing I’ve heard time and time again is that alumni really miss the connection to the courses, the new coursework that is going on, the intellectual life of the university. The Harvard Alumni Association really does a good job of trying to keep those ties strong, but ultimately, it’s hard for alumni to connect with the courses,” Lue said. “The idea is to use [HarvardX] as a foundation to really create an online environment that will pull alumni back to Harvard so they can reconnect and continue to network with their peers.”
The initiative, which has been nicknamed AlumniX, was born out of collaboration between the Harvard Alumni Association and HarvardX. Lue said he got the idea after a conversation at an alumni event with Sam W. Lessin ’05, who now works for Facebook.
“We were joking and saying, ‘This is how we’re going to achieve Harvard Class of Forever,” Lue said. “Wouldn’t it be great to—as you go through the world—continue to connect with new Harvard people?”
While AlumniX will share qualities of the overall HarvardX program, it will include a stronger, more explicit focus on networking, both among alumni and between alumni and the University.
“One of the things we were always concerned with was the question, ‘How do we make possible alumni connection?’ Socially, it’s not a problem. However, intellectually, this is more difficult,” Peter K. Bol, the vice provost for Advances in Learning, said. “That is what we are trying to do with AlumniX.”
In addition, AlumniX will serve as an incubator for experimentation with modular courseware, which combines components of multiple different courses interspersed with original material  such as interviews with faculty members.
“We’re increasingly interested in the power of modular content,” Lue said. “A ‘course’–that fixed thing–is not really the most effective bite size. Perhaps smaller modules will be more effective.”
Though HarvardX for Alumni was not conceived as a catalyst for the ongoing capital campaign, Lue said the reconnection it encourages might be beneficial to the campaign.
“There’s no direct and explicit connection [between HarvardX for Alumni and the capital campaign],” Lue said. “It’s not like we’re tied with the campaign in any way at all. However, one might argue that it’s always good for the campaign to reconnect with alumni. So that’s kind of frosting on the cake.”

Representatives from the Undergraduate Council voted in favor of a revised version of the honor code at the group’s weekly meeting Sunday night, despite concerns that the Council’s legislation failed to address lingering questions about the formation of an honor board.
At the meeting, students from the Academic Integrity Committee—accompanied by incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Assistant Dean of the College and Associate Secretary of the Administrative Board Brett Flehinger, and Associate Director of the Program in General Education Anne Marie E. Calareso—presented a revised draft of the honor code and answered questions from UC representatives.
The draft introduced to the Council contained slightly different wording from the previous version released in early January and lacked a paragraph regarding the formation of an honor board. Flehinger said such a board would logically be created after the honor code is finalized.
 


Still, members of the UC debated whether the draft alone was sufficient to justify a final vote on the measure. Because the proposal must ultimately pass by the Faculty Council, the highest elected body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the code could undergo significant structural changes by the time the final draft is approved.
While several UC representatives expressed support of the proposal, Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, a representative from Quincy House, cautioned against what could be seen as the UC writing “a blank check” by endorsing the measure without fully knowing what the honor board would entail or whether further stipulations would be added to the code.
Biebelberg, who was the only member of the UC who voted against the measure, said after the meeting that, although he is pleased with the progress the honor code has made, he did not think it was appropriate for the UC to officially endorse the proposal until it was able to review all the final details.
Terah E. Lyons ’14, a member of the Academic Integrity Committee, responded to concerns about the details of the legislation by describing the proposal as a “symbolic gesture” of reaching out for student input.
“[A favorable vote by the Council] would just be a gesture...that you are approving it to go forward in sort of the right direction,” she said.
After members of the Council were dismissed from the meeting, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 said he supported the Council’s decision to adopt the version of the honor code brought before them and shared his view of the significance of the vote.
“I think it’s important to remember that we are approving the process of creating an honor code, not any specific honor code at this point,” Mayopoulos said.
The Council also considered three other legislative pieces.
Stemming from a referendum that passed in November’s election, the UPASS Referendum Act, which would work to create a partnership between Harvard and the MBTA so that students could receive discounted transportation passes, passed with overwhelming support despite uncertainty about funding the proposal.
The UC also agreed to divert an additional $5,000 to the Freshman Life Fund and to allocate up to $300 from Student Initiative Committee funds for Valentine’s Day grants.

Due to a mistake in the way the University reported its employees’ taxable income, approximately 11,000 Harvard employees paid excess income taxes between 2009 and 2013, with the hardest hit contributing several thousands dollars more than they should have.
 
The misclassification of earnings occurred after Harvard changed the structure of its supplemental life insurance plan, such that the benefit should no longer have been taxable, according to a letter the Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann sent to all affected employees on Feb. 7. Despite the change, the University did not alter the way it reported taxable income, which resulted in employees paying taxes on income that they did not receive. 
Hausammann’s letter stated that the total excess reported income exceeded $20 million, although individual employees were affected to different extents. In 2013, 13 percent of the 11,000 affected employees paid taxes on more than $1000 of excess income, with a “small number” paying taxes on more than $10,000 of excess income. Sixty percent of the 11,000 affected employees were taxed on $200 or less of excess income.
In the Feb. 7 letter, Hausammann said that the University will help affected employees file amended returns for 2011 and 2012 and fully compensate all employees who paid too much in taxes in 2009 and 2010, which are outside the statute of limitation for appeals.
 
“Harvard will take a series of steps to ensure that those affected do not incur any financial losses related to this situation, including payments for excess taxes paid in years where individuals can no longer file corrected returns, reimbursement for out-of-pocket tax preparation costs, and educational programming on filing an amended return,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email. 
The affected employees were first informed of the mistake by a letter from the Harvard Benefits Office on Jan. 21. According to Alvin C. Warren and Daniel I. Halperin, two Harvard Law School professors who specialize in tax law and policy, the letter did not accurately convey the situation. The pair responded with their own letter to Law School faculty and staff, as well as Hausammann and Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, pointing out the mistakes.
 
“Nowhere is the total scope of the problem frankly presented,” Warren and Halperin’s letter read. They noted that the University’s letter only discussed 2011-2013, even though the same tax mistake occurred in 2009 and 2010, as well.
 
The letter also expressed concern that the initial Benefits Office announcement reported that "IRS regulations do not allow the University to assist you in filing for a state or federal income tax refund,” which Warren and Halperin said do not exist. They called for the University to take more steps to ensure that all affected employees were compensated appropriately.
 
Three days later, on Feb. 7, Hausammann wrote a letter to all affected employees that began with an apology and responded to many of Warren and Halperin’s concerns.
 
“I offer my sincere apologies for the error itself and for the failure of the initial letter to communicate effectively, including about the nature and scope of the problem, and Harvard’s proposed response,” Hausammann wrote. The letter went on to clarify the details of the situation and what the University would do to assist those who were affected.
While Halperin said in an interview with The Crimson on Sunday that the steps Harvard aims to take to compensate employees are “reasonable,” he raised concerns about the four-year time span in which no official caught the mistake after the life insurance policy was changed.
 
“I don’t know what happened,” Halperin said. “Somebody in both Human Resources and in payroll should have been aware about what was going on, but apparently they didn’t connect.”
 
According to the Harvard University Fact Book, the University employed more than 16,000 people in the 2011-2012 academic year, the last for which there are publicly available records. During the 2013 fiscal year, the University paid more than $1.5 billion in compensation.
 
Director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Bill Jaeger said that, as a Harvard employee who was directly affected by the mistake and as the leader of the University’s largest union, the mistake is a troubling oversight.
 
“Our union doesn’t spend a lot of time or resources double checking because we want to be able to assume that, in terms of tax reporting and compliance in general with the federal legal framework, the benefits programs are being competently managed,” Jaeger said. “So it’s a little unsettling to have this big question just pop up and cast doubt on the quality of the management of our programs.

UPDATED: Feb. 10, 2013, at 11:01 p.m.
One College student died and three others were injured in a traffic accident on the New Jersey Turnpike early Monday morning while returning from a mock trial competition in Virginia.
Angela R. Mathew ’15 died in the accident, which occurred at 12:35 a.m. Monday, according to New Jersey State Police. She was 20 years old.
Florence Y. Chen ’15, Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16, and Graham J. Wyatt ’14 were injured and taken to a hospital in Trenton following the accident, Sergeant First Class Gregory M. Williams said in a phone interview late Monday afternoon. Wyatt, a Leverett House resident, was seriously injured but is now in stable condition following surgery, according to an email from Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 to the Leverett community.
New Jersey State Police Trooper Jeff Flynn confirmed by phone Monday evening that the the undergraduates were driving in a 2012 Chrysler Town and Country minivan. Flynn said that the car was driving on the New Jersey Turnpike when it crossed over multiple lanes of traffic and slammed into a guardrail before being struck by a tractor-trailer.
Flynn said that Mathew was ejected from the minivan and was pronounced dead at the scene.
The four students were travelling with three others in a van, according to an email from Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister. Students with the group travelling in a different vehicle were not injured.
“This is a tragedy and I join you all in the feeling of loss Angela's death brings. She was a very bright, talented young woman. Our hearts are broken,” Pfister wrote in the email early Monday evening. “This is a very sudden and unexpected loss.”
Mathew, a Leverett House resident, was a neurobiology concentrator from Albuquerque, N.M., and was a high school seminar director for the Harvard Mock Trial Association, according to the team’s website.
The four undergraduates were members of the Harvard Mock Trial Association and had traveled to Richmond, Va., for a tournament at the University of Richmond, held from Feb. 8-9. Ted Ritter, a coach for the University of Richmond mock trial team, expressed his condolences in an email Monday.
“We are truly saddened by the news,” Ritter wrote. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the [families] of the students involved in the accident and the other members of the Mock Trial team.”
Georgi, Leverett co-master, hosted a gathering for students in the masters’ residence at 7:30 p.m. Monday, and opened up the event to residents of other Houses at 8 p.m. Students met there for conversations, and Pfister and Undergraduate Council leaders were present. Students there could share their thoughts and memories of Mathew in a memory book.
Pfister also shared the news with students’ parents Monday, sending them a copy of the email he sent to undergraduates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
American Express Company CEO Kenneth I. Chenault and former Obama Cabinet member Karen Gordon Mills ’75 were elected to become the newest members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, at its regularly scheduled meeting this weekend. They will become the organization’s 12th and 13th members on July 1 as 12-year members Robert D. Reischauer ’63, and Robert E. Rubin ’60 step down at the end of the academic year.
 
Chenault and Mills will officially join the governing board on July 1.
 
“I’m honored to be returning to Harvard and joining the Corporation,” Chenault, who graduated from the Law School in 1976, said in a press release. “The University has been an important part of my life for many years.”
 
Chenault served on the Law School’s visiting committee from 2006 to 2013 and is currently a member on the Dean’s Advisory Board and of Harvard’s Committee on University Resources.
 
Outside of the University, Chenault has served on numerous boards and advisory councils, including the Bloomberg Family Foundation, the National Academy Foundation,  the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center, and the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. Additionally, he was elected to President Barack Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in 2011.
 
Mills, both a College and Business School graduate, has similarly stayed connected to the University, having served on Harvard’s Board of Overseers from 1999 to 2005. She held the position of vice chair of the board’s executive committee for 2004-2005, and served for two years as chair of the board’s standing committee on finance, administration, and management.
 
“Our Harvard community includes the most remarkable students, staff, and faculty, and together they have potential to contribute to and influence our world in so many meaningful ways.” Mills said in the press release. “I look forward to working with the entire leadership team and President Faust to help shape the future of this great University and its continued role as a driving force for critical thinking, innovation, and excellence.”
 
A senior fellow at both the Harvard Business School and the Harvard Kennedy School’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government and fall 2013 resident fellow at the Institute of Politics, Mills served as the administrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration from 2009 to 2013 in the aftermath of the recession, and as a member of the president’s National Economic Council, she managed a loan guarantee portfolio of nearly $100 billion and enabled nearly a quarter of U.S. government prime contracts to be awarded to small businesses.
 
“Harvard is again fortunate to be able to turn to two such accomplished and dedicated graduates to help guide the University’s affairs and help all of us envision and embrace the possibilities ahead,” Reischauer and University President Drew G. Faust said in the press release.
 
In 2010, the Corporation announced reforms to its structure, increasing membership from seven to 13 and enacting term limits to emulate the organization of other peer universities’ governing bodies. The election and addition of James W. Breyer in July 2013 marked the completion of the expansion.
 
Reischauer and Rubin announced they would retire from the governing board in October. Corporation member William F. Lee ’72 will succeed Reischauer as the body’s senior fellow.

Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist and Nieman Fellow Greg Marinovich criticized the corruption of the South African government and the country’s widening racial and socioeconomic rifts Monday afternoon, in a seminar reflecting on the legacy of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The seminar, which took place at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, gave attendees the opportunity to discuss the impact of Mandela’s passing on the future of South Africa, where Marinovich was born and raised.
 
“Now that Mandela has passed away, what we want to ask is who really Mandela was and does it matter,” Marinovich said. “There is a dilemma now that maybe Mandela wasn’t the solution.”
According to Marinovich, who also co-authored a book on South Africa’s transition to democracy, although Mandela suffered great hardship for his beliefs and was a great leader, South Africa faces the same issues it faced in the past—race, inequality, and government corruption.
He added that though Mandela has not held an influential leadership position for over a decade, the fact that he was still living gave South Africa an “empty hope” that the man who had stood for change a decade before still signified South African progress.
“On the whole, I found the whole presentation somewhat pessimistic,” Jane Portal, who works for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, said about the seminar. Portal said that she came to the event because her son currently works in South Africa.
Portal agreed with Marinovich that although South Africans celebrated Mandela’s life and achievements after his death, many issues in South Africa remain unresolved.
“It’s quite right that he was a figurehead, that a lot of things he shelved,” she said.
Marinovich concluded the seminar by stating that “we have more power than we think. We still have the vote, our voice. These things could catch on.”
 
Monday’s event was part of a monthly seminar series, the Herbert C. Kelman Seminar on International Conflict Analysis and Resolution, which Associate of the Weatherhead Center Donna Hicks said has been ongoing for the past ten years. It is co-sponsored by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, and the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.

Less than a week after the release of his debut book, “One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories,” Harvard College alumnus and actor B. J. Novak ’01 read excerpts from his compilation of 63 fictional narratives to a sold-out Brattle Theatre audience Monday evening.
During the reading, Novak, a Newton, Mass. native, often referred satirically to “a school in Harvard Square,” referencing his alma mater, where he was an active member of the Hasty Pudding Club as well as the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
Novak prefaced his reading with an anecdote about ordering “The Mindy Kaling” from Mass. Ave. burger joint Mr. Bartley’s Gourmet Burgers, a dish named after his co-star in the hit television series, “The Office.”
 
“[The employee] said, ‘Great. Let me just read that back to you: you want to eat Mindy Kaling,’” Novak narrated. “I said, ‘I’ll make the jokes here pal.’”
The story, including Novak’s ultimate discovery that Bartley’s named their special of the day in his honor, prompted laughter from the audience.
Novak read seven short stories to the audience, ranging from brief fantasy tales to an extended story about attending concerts in heaven. Following the reading, Novak hosted a question-and-answer session, offering some inside scoops about the book as well as information about “The Office.”
In addition to the book reading, Novak also conducted a book signing earlier in the afternoon at the Harvard Book Store. This second event was arranged after tickets for the reading sold out much quicker than anticipated.
 
“[The reading] sold out in just a few days and luckily [Novak] had time on his schedule to add on this lunchtime signing,” Alex W. Meriwether, Harvard Book Store marketing manager, said.
 
Over 150 people showed up during the one-hour book signing slot, compelling some fans to leave the store due to the long wait.
“As much of a fan as I am of B.J. Novak, I just personally can’t justify waiting in such a long line to have a book signed,” Matthew M. Casso ’17 said.
 
Meriwether said that he hasn’t seen a daytime book signing as popular as Novak’s since the store hosted a signing for Shaquille O’Neal, who published his autobiography, "Shaq Uncut: My Story," in 2011.

The Cambridge City Council debated a proposal to appoint a task force to investigate early childhood education services in the city during its weekly meeting Monday evening.
The task force, which would be spearheaded by City Manager Richard C. Rossi, would identify a range of possible options for the expansion of early childhood services and explore the benefits and challenges of each.
According to the proposal, the task force will consist of 15 individuals, who range from government administration officials and leaders of community education programs. The task force will present its findings and recommendations by June 2015.
During public comment, former Massachusetts State Representative and former Cambridge Mayor Alice K. Wolf spoke in support of the task force. Wolf commented on the overwhelming amount of research that demonstrates the importance of early childhood education and noted the absence of these programs in Cambridge.
“It’s important for the children, for their families,” Wolf said. “Frankly, it’s important for the long term health of the community to have universal early education.”
Cambridge resident Emily Dexter also said that better early childhood education programs would help close the gap between the urban, underprivileged youth and children in the wealthier Cambridge suburbs.
“The positive effects of early childhood education will fail over time if students are not enrolled in high quality elementary schooling,” Dexter said
While almost all of the Council members agreed that early childhood education could be improved in the city, many of the council members took issue with the composition of the task force itself. Councillor Marc McGovern said that while he is pleased with the idea of having a task force, he was concerned with the lack of community representation on the panel.
“I want to make sure that we are not losing sight of the family home care providers in this conversation,” McGovern said. “They are going to be huge pieces of this puzzle.”
Councillor E. Denise Simmons echoed McGovern’s sentiments and said that she would like to see more individuals on the task force who were just parents.
However, Rossi said he wants to keep the task force small and is worried that including more members will make it hard to manage.
“I do not want to end up with a task force of 35 people,” Rossi said. “I just can’t begin to tell you that we would be successful.”

The Harvard women’s squash team took one more step towards its goal of repeating as national champions this season, as the top-ranked Crimson beat both Yale and Brown this weekend to finish the regular season undefeated and claim sole ownership of the Ivy League title. With the wins, the Harvard women earned their 19th conference title and went unbeaten for the thirteenth time in program history.
 
After a 7-2 win over Yale (15-3, 5-2 Ivy) ensured the Crimson (12-0, 7-0) at least a share of the trophy, it was Sunday’s match against 10th-ranked Brown (10-7, 0-7) that left Harvard alone at the top of the standings. The Crimson cruised to a 9-0 win over the Bears to clinch the Ivy title in its last match before the national tournament in two weeks.
 
“It’s a huge deal for me as a senior,” co-captain Natasha Anzik said. “I couldn’t really ask for a better end of the season so far. I know for me and Georgie Brinkley it was actually our last match in college squash today, so it was a bittersweet day for sure, but I couldn’t be happier, and couldn’t ask for a better group of girls to share that with.”
 
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
 
In Sunday’s match against Brown, Harvard was in complete control from the start. The Crimson ran the table against its last opponent of the regular season, dropping only one game in the entire match to earn a commanding 9-0 win.
 
“Brown is ranked tenth, so they’re a little bit lower down the order, but we wanted to not get too confident,” Anzik said. “Our plan was just to go out and play our squash, because the way we’ve been playing, we can definitely be competitive with any team out there right now. It was just about keeping it simple and staying consistent.”
Junior Amanda Sobhy led the way in the top position, easily dispatching Brown’s Dori Rabhar with scores of 11-4, 11-4, and 11-0. Freshman Katie Tutrone also blew through her match in the second position, as she took down Sarah Domenick in three sets.
 
“My girl was pretty solid; she was a good player,” Tutrone said. “I had played her as a junior, so it was fun playing her again, but it wasn’t too hard. None of the matches really were, but I was just really happy afterward to have a win because it was the last match of the regular season.”
 
Sophomores Saumya Karki and Michelle Gemmell also swept their matches in the next two positions. Sophomore Isabelle Dowling and freshmen Dileas MacGowan, Megan Murray, and Caroline Monrad won their matches by scores of 3-0 as well. Harvard’s only dropped game came in the fifth position, as junior Julianne Chu battled back after losing the second set to close out the match with wins in the final two frames.
 
HARVARD 7, YALE 2
 
The Crimson started off the weekend with the tougher of its two matches, as it faced No. 4 Yale in the deciding match for at least a share of the Ivy League title. Harvard came away with a 7-2 win, with two of the victories coming in close matches that went to five sets to determine the winner.
 
“I think it was a great weekend to finish the end of our regular season games,” Anzik said. “We just focused on keeping mental focus, and I think that [the team] used everything they learned all season and really applied all of that to this weekend.”
 
After Sobhy and Tutrone cruised to easy wins in the first and third positions, respectively, junior Haley Mendez saw Harvard’s first real test of the match in the second spot. The co-captain outlasted Yale’s Kimberly Hay for a 3-2 victory after posting scores of 13-11, 8-11, 11-7, 2-11, and 11-8. Karki came away with another 3-2 victory in the fourth position to give the Crimson the upper hand.
 
MacGowan, Murray and Chu earned Harvard’s last three wins, while Gemmell and Dowling dropped close decisions in the fifth and eighth positions, respectively. The team now turns their attention to the national tournament in two weeks, where it will enter as the number-one seed.
 
“Going into nationals is just about continuing to keep doing what we’re doing,” Anzik said. “We’re going to have some very challenging matches during nationals, so everyone has their own specific thing to work on for the next two weeks. We’re all very fit and very happy with where we are right now, so we’re just focusing on getting through the next two weeks.”

The Harvard women’s tennis team continued to roll this weekend, as the Crimson pushed its home win streak to five matches with victories over Boston University and Syracuse. The win over the Orange also marked the 100th victory in head coach Traci Green’s career.
 
This weekend saw dominant performances from the Harvard women (4-1), as the match against BU (3-2) was called after four matches to give the Crimson a 4-0 win, and the team took a 6-1 decision over Syracuse (0-5). In both matches, Harvard was boosted by the strong play of the 34th-ranked doubles team of freshmen Spencer Liang and Monica Lin, who dispatched their opponents in one set on both days.
 
“I think we had a really successful weekend,” Liang said. “Everyone fought really hard, and of course we got the results that we wanted—we won both matches, which was exciting to see.”
 
HARVARD 6, SYRACUSE 1
 
After playing a shortened match against BU, the Crimson proved it could still fight through a full set of matches when it took down Syracuse by a sizeable 6-1 tally on Sunday. The team took two of three doubles matches and five of six singles to come away with the victory.
 
Liang and Lin started the match off strong, as the team took down the Syracuse duo of Maddie Kobelt and Valeria Salazar in a 6-2 decision. The Orange quickly tied the match up, as senior Hannah Morrill and freshman June Lee fell to Amanda Rodgers and Komal Safdar in a close 6-4 set at second doubles.
 
“Mentally and physically, [your mindset] is just different in the longer matches,” Lee said. “With BU, we knew that we stopped after four matches, but mentally we still had to fight for every point and know that it could go either way at any time in the match. Today we obviously had to play it out, and it was going to be more tiring physically, but we also tried to stay really tough mentally.”
 
After sophomore Amanda Lin and junior Sylvia Li won at third doubles to give Harvard the doubles point and put the Crimson up, 1-0, the match turned to singles play. Harvard quickly wrapped up the contest, winning three of the first four matches.
 
Monica Lin was the first to finish her match, as she quickly dispatched Kobelt at second singles to give the Crimson the first singles point, and Lee also won her match at third singles in two sets. After Morrill was defeated by Breanna Bachini at fifth singles to give Syracuse its only point of the match, it fell to Liang to give Harvard its fourth point. She succeeded, beating Rodgers in a third set tiebreaker to clinch the match for Harvard.
 
“[Rodgers] was very tall and she was a lefty, and she was just overall a good player,” Liang said. “I took the first set, 6-2, and then she fought back and won, 6-3. Even though I lost the set I just stayed calm and just kept fighting, and my teammates helped me stay intense and inspired me to fight for them.”
 
Amanda Lin and Amy He also recorded wins for the Crimson to finish off the 6-1 victory.
 
HARVARD 4, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 0
 
On Saturday, Harvard blanked the visiting Terriers from BU, winning the doubles point and the first three singles matches in straight sets to make quick work of the match.
 
“We had amazing energy,” Lee said. “We were really focused, but we were cheering each other on so much. It was amazing, it was so loud on the court all the time. You could just feel the support.”
 
Liang and Lin took the first doubles match in a 6-3 decision, and Morrill and Lee followed suit with their own 6-3 victory at second doubles to secure the doubles point for Harvard. The match then moved into the singles, where the Crimson continued its dominant play. Morrill swept Sami Lieb with 6-0 and 6-1 victories and was followed quickly by Lin’s 6-1, 6-3 win at second singles to put Harvard one point away from a victory.
 
Lee wrapped up the match with her second win of the day, a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Leonie-Charloette Athanasiadis. All other matches in progress were stopped after Harvard clinched the match in a 4-0 victory.
 
“I’m just looking to stay aggressive throughout the whole match and stay positive,” Lee said. “I think as a team our goal is just going to make sure that we support each other and make each other play as best as we can.”

The much anticipated housing day trailers have finally arrived, and Lowell has made yet another incredible statement: a parody of Yoncé’s “Drunk in Love” to seduce freshman to Lowell house. 
On February 9 an email was sent out from lowellhousebells@gmail.com with the subject "Hope you win the lottery!" Inside the message was an introduction to a preview of this year’s Lowell housing day video: "Drunk in Lowell."
 


 The Lowell HoCo surely knows how to impress, introducing their ever-so sophisticated housemasters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin drinking tea while listening to Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s newest hit. These two housemasters aren’t new to the freshman housing videos: They were featured in last year’s hit "Get Lowell," when they accidentally dropped a teacup in the seemingly serene and mature Lowell House before dropping the beat for Lil Jon, the East Side Boyz, and the Ying Yang Twins to "Get Lowell."
As for the other houses, this Drunk in Lowell trailer seems like a tough one to beat. There’s no match for Queen B. But have no fear: if you are another house in search of a good Beyoncé song to use for your housing day video, we have come up with some of the Queen’s songs to place in your house.
Adams: "Adams on Top." Because who can resist Beyoncé’s "Love on Top"?
Mather: "Pretty Hurts."  If you can’t flaunt any good looks, you might as well try and say they hurt.
Quad houses: "All I Could Do Was Cry." Who wouldn’t.
 So while the Lowell HoCo is getting drunk in Lowell, the other houses better step up their game before house masters D & D show them up again.
Good luck, and may the housing gods be ever in your favor.
