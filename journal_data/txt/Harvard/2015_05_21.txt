Todd Haynes’s “Carol” is beautiful and nostalgic, like a call to a distant memory, or longing for a an unspeakable, hidden love. Its simplicity of plot belies a mastery of texture and mood that puts it head and shoulders above most modern romances.
The film tells the story of two women falling in love in the 1950s. The director's stylish touch stops time and extends the emotions in the film far beyond the screen. Creating a world of yesterday is Haynes’s speciality, and his obsession with vintage is maximized in “Carol,” which was shot completely on 16mm film. Objects like fur mink coats, Christmas hats, and train toy sets become the center of the film; they speak softly of the longings and hesitations of the characters. Haynes creates a world where lovers talk in gazes, street views are filtered by cafe windows, restaurants play Billie Holiday, and people dress like characters in “Casablanca.” At some points, it is really hard to believe that it is a film produced in 2015, because even the narrative resembles the stories of Hollywood’s golden age. Haynes uses none of the flowery flashbacks, shaky tracking shots or crazy shot angles that have become an indispensible part of the cinema language of the current day. In other films such a daring decision might result in monotony, but it suits “Carol” perfectly.
One reason that Haynes can be so confident about the simplicity of the story and style is the two leading actresses, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, whose performances are the backbone of the whole film. Cate Blanchett’s title character is a rich woman determined to have full control of her life. She is getting divorced from her dominant husband when she meets Mara’s Therese, a saleswoman at a department store. As they start to develop a relationship, Carol plays the role of a pursuer; she is playful, seductive and sometimes even aggressive, but always in an elegant and subtle way. Blanchett poses like a model shooting for Vogue even when she is just eating, and her every gaze is unfathomably implicative. In the latter part of the film, as she is subjected to outside pressures, her confidence diminishes and she slowly loses her self-control; even at this point, however, she never loses her grandeur.
The passivity of Mara’s character makes it more difficult for her acting to shine as brightly as Blanchett’s, but she still gives an unforgettable and believable performance as a young girl unsure about herself who admires Carol for her insight, her confidence, and her maturity. Many times in the movie, she just stares at Carol with eyes that seem genuinely full of love and tenderness, and when their relationship results in terrible outcomes she convincingly trembles with fear and worries for her lover. Blanchett and Mara’s ability to communicate without dialogue is incredible and affecting.

After four years marked by mostly middling-quality sequels, animation studio Pixar finally returns to form with the delightfully imaginative “Inside Out,” an original story that explores the nature of emotion. The film balances two very different plots. On a macro level, the story focuses on a young girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) who must adjust to the challenges of life in a new city after moving from Minnesota to San Francisco. But the majority of the film takes place inside of Riley’s mind at the microscopic scale, exploring the interactions between five anthropomorphized feelings that control her actions: the golden, relentlessly optimistic Joy (Amy Poehler), the blue, Eeyore-like Sadness (Phyllis Smith), the red, literally explosive Anger (Lewis Black), the purple, perpetually paranoid Fear (Bill Hader), and the green, casually cool Disgust (Mindy Kaling). From inside a quite literal Headquarters, the five emotions collectively oversee Riley’s life—managing everything from dream production to long-term memory conversion.
Screenplay writers Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley, and Peter Docter (who directed as well as wrote) push the boundaries of imagination with the incredibly colorful world inside Riley’s head: memories are stored as swirling, color-coded orbs in large, sprawling bookshelves that resemble folded brain tissue, a literal train of thought travels throughout the mind, and fading memories are dumped into a dark abyss where they are forgotten forever. Core memories—those fundamental to Riley’s identity—are stored in a special location at Headquarters, and they each provide power to an island that represents a different personality facet, such as honesty.
When a conflict between Joy and Sadness results in the inadvertent loss of both emotions and several core memories deep in the recesses of Riley’s mind, the emotions must work together to restore Riley back to normal. What follows is a literal mindtrip through Riley’s head—through the infinite mazes of Long Term Memory, the unbounded chaos of Imagination Land, and the Hollywood-like studios of Dream Productions. The film is carried by compelling voice performances from Poehler and Smith, whose characters serve as obvious foils symbolizing the two sides of the emotional spectrum. Joy strongly resembles Poehler’s character Leslie Knope from “Parks and Recreation,” and her controlling, emphatic cheerfulness constantly seeks to marginalize the seemingly superfluous Sadness.
Through the lens of emotion, the film emphasizes the value of change—the audience sees Joy struggle to reconcile the existence of Sadness and futilely hold onto happy memories of the past, but ultimately even she must accept that things will be different after the move. Happy memories of playing hockey in Minnesota can also become sad memories of a former home without ruining the memory’s significance. It is a simple lesson, but one that is presented with tenderness and nuance.
At times capable of evoking a profound sense of childlike wonder and loss, “Inside Out” does what Pixar does best—and the result is a thoughtful coming-of-age film that will leave children wide-eyed and adults wistful.

At first glance a far departure from the typical arthouse fare of the Festival de Cannes, Denis Villeneuve’s American action-thriller “Sicario” (Spanish for “Hitman”) presents a dark, provocative message about the war against the Mexican drug cartels that earns the film a solid position as a contender for this year’s Palme d’Or. Villeneuve smartly utilizes explosive action sequences like the film’s introductory scene very sparingly and to strong effect; he chooses to highlight the oftentimes unseen consequences of drug violence through the perspective of protagonist Kate Macy (Emily Blunt).
Macy, an FBI agent who specializes in kidnapping, becomes involved with a covert domestic CIA operation against the drug cartels led by the enigmatic Matt (Josh Brolin) and cold-blooded Alejandro (Benicio del Toro). Macy’s confusion throughout the first half of the film is a stand-in for the audience’s—she questions the motive of every step of the operation, from a prisoner transport across the border in Ciudad Juárez to the illegal freezing of a known drug lord’s financial assets. Matt and Alejandro’s ultimate goal is unclear, and their fast and loose tactics draw the ire of Blunt’s frank and by-the-book character. Taylor Sheridan’s script deftly keeps the audience in the dark as well, leaving one to question the legitimacy of the operation as bodies slowly pile up with no reasonable explanation.
The film’s central question is that of morality in the drug wars: how does one properly combat a massive organization that regularly resorts to the horrific tactics of kidnapping, torture, and execution? In Matt’s opinion, until 20 percent of the American population stops purchasing illegal drugs, the next best option is to try to maintain some semblance of control—even if it means resorting to measures some may find distasteful. Blunt and del Toro deliver compelling performances that explore the problems with both sides of this argument, and the audience sees at the film’s conclusion that del Toro’s dead-faced character has no trouble making a descent into hell. Blunt’s character is also forced to make a tough decision, but Villeneuve leaves final judgment with the viewer. Regardless of one’s leaning, “Sicario” leaves an indelible reminder of the daily horrors that occur just south of the border—one that forces the viewer to confront seriously a national problem under a new light.

School of Public Health professor and associate dean David J. Hunter will serve as the school’s acting dean during its search to replace Julio Frenk, who is set to depart for Miami in mid-August.
Hunter will take the reins in the middle of Harvard’s University-wide capital campaign and as the school allocates funding from its recent $350 million gift from Gerald L. Chan—the largest single donation in Harvard’s history. Frenk, who served as dean for six years, will depart to assume a position as president of University of Miami.
A School of Public Health alumnus, Hunter specializes in cancer prevention, with a focus on breast, colorectal, and skin cancers. As dean for academic affairs, he is charged with overseeing the academic operations of the school including faculty and student affairs, diversity, and research administration, according to the school’s website.
“David is a deeply experienced and much-admired faculty member who has played an essential role in the school's recent accomplishments, and I am very grateful to him for his willingness to lead the school and sustain its forward momentum while the dean search proceeds,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in an email to School of Public Health affiliates.
Faust has assembled an advisory group for the search composed of School of Public Health faculty members, including David R. Bangsberg, Lisa Berkman, Robert J. Blendon, David Cutler, Wafaie W. Fawzi, Russ Hauser, Gökhan S. Hotamisligil, Paula A. Johnson, Howard Koh, Jennifer Leaning, Xihong Lin, Marc Lipsitch, and Marianne Wessling-Resnick.
