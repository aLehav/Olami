After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While we could write an entire book on the wonderful and transformative nature of public libraries, our chapter on late fees wouldn’t be quite so chipper. A recent change, though, has given us hope that we might soon be able to rip out these pages entirely: The Cambridge Public Library, starting on Oct. 19, began piloting a program designed to abolish fees on most late return items.
Indeed, libraries themselves are the cornerstones of community life in America, emerging as an essential component of our social safety net. Beyond simply serving as pleasant spaces, libraries actively offer a host of essential services — from free WiFi to resume building workshops — that people of all ages and backgrounds can benefit from. Especially in light of dwindling funding for more explicit social safety net programs, libraries step in to fulfill this vital role.
Late fees, however, deserve no place within such empowering community spaces. Cambridge residents have busy lives, and late fees, in practice, amount to little more than the imposition of enormously regressive penalties upon individuals who are already swamped and struggling. This burden inevitably falls hardest on low-income individuals, which feels especially counterintuitive in light of the fact that people who cannot afford to buy books themselves are, indeed, among the most important beneficiaries of the public libraries.
Late fees are not just unnecessarily punitive — they also serve no real purpose besides decreasing the accessibility of public libraries, books, and the transmission of knowledge. In unpacking the frivolous — even counterproductive — nature of late fees, the evidence clearly speaks for itself: Libraries across the country that have eliminated late fees have found that doing away with these fines has actually led to more books being returned, as library patrons no longer fear fines upon returning a book.
The imperative to increase access to libraries becomes even more vital when situated within the crisis of literacy in the United States: The U.S.’s relatively high literacy rate masks devastating inequities in reading abilities and access to literature among our nation’s youth. Reading ability among children is directly correlated with their life outcomes, yet socioeconomic status continues to be significantly related to children’s reading development. Against this backdrop, libraries are a critical component of any plan to bridge these divides, as they can provide cost-free options to parents and serve to promote reading skills within children across backgrounds and identities.
To that end, we would like to applaud the city of Cambridge for making library funding a priority. We hope that other cities choose to follow Cambridge’s lead, and to carefully invest in their own public library systems. After all, when we choose to invest in libraries, we are also choosing to invest in people, children, and the communities in which they are situated.
We also urge Harvard’s own libraries to become more deliberate about making themselves accessible to the broader community. Some enclaves at the University like the Harvard Art Museums, which is free for Cambridge residents, have already begun to make their resources available to non-Harvard affiliates. Ultimately, this offers a model to follow and serves as a testament to the fact that similar efforts certainly can, and should, be pursued.
Libraries serve as a great equalizer — they provide access to knowledge without a prohibitively high barrier to entry, and they are the bedrock of public education in this country. We hope that more libraries begin to follow in the footsteps of the Cambridge Public Library: to collectively refuse to judge a patron’s book by its cover, and to write a story that ultimately ends with late fees being abolished for all.

In 1944, amidst the height of World War II, renowned American singer Bing Crosby recorded “Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,” a catchy and uplifting ballad about the importance of attitude. The song inspires us to four main goals: accentuate the positive, eliminate the negative, latch on to the affirmative, and don’t mess with Mr. In-Between.
As we gear up for Thanksgiving this week, some of us prepare to flip on our gratitude switch for the first time all year. Unfortunately, that can mean we turn up a little rusty. For some college students, stressful Thanksgiving circumstances, such as relative feuds or readjusting to briefly living with family, can make us itch to return to campus rather than hear another reason to be grateful at the dinner table. That doesn’t make us bad people — it’s simply easier to see the negatives accentuated in our limited vision. Despite its importance, being grateful does not always come naturally, but practicing the wise advice of Bing Crosby can help us re-envision our surroundings as perfectly timely.
Crosby’s first and foremost piece of advice to us all is to Accentuate the Positive. It’s easy to notice the things in our lives that seem to be going wrong: school, family, friends, the list is almost never-ending. But what many people fail to realize is that striving to extract the good from even the bleak situations can change our perspective on our problems altogether. I often feel that society has developed an over-reliance on negative tactics. It’s undeniable that we are swarmed right and left with issues on multiple fronts but it seems that our default solution is to resort to negativity, attacks, and division.
I believe we could be so much more effective at facing our problems if we took the opposite approach — recognizing the good in every situation and bringing it into the spotlight as a means of unity and gratitude. The more we focus on the positives, the more likely we are to find joy and purpose in even the wildest circumstances and persevere through them. Instead of approaching a seemingly unfavorable situation with a grim view, we can convince ourselves to make the most of it and find a place for ourselves amidst the chaos.
Accentuating the positive goes hand in hand with Eliminating the Negative. Eliminating the negative does not necessarily mean single-handedly dissolving all the world’s problems. Instead, eliminating can manifest in more practical ways that are less flashy. When Crosby tells us to eliminate the negative, what he really means is to eliminate our own negatives: To re-evaluate the world without our preconceived notions and remove ourselves from worrying about situations that are out of our control. Developing this laissez-faire attitude can do wonders in helping you appreciate your circumstances just as they are, always and everywhere.
Once we’ve developed this mindset, we must find a way to maintain it: Latch onto the Affirmative. To me, this means seeking company that makes us feel welcomed and encourages us towards gratefulness. Surrounding yourself with individuals that accept you can ensure that the wheel of positivity keeps turning. I have learned that you can find your people anywhere you go as long as you look for them. This past weekend, as I looked out at the crowd in the stands during Harvard-Yale, I felt overcome with a sense of gratitude for finding wonderful friends to spend the next four years with but more importantly, gratitude to be part of the larger student body that feels an intense sense of shared Crimson identity. When we fly home for Thanksgiving this week, I hope we can continue that commitment to latching on to our affirmatives and find comfort with our families, our people who will always support us and shower us with appreciation.
Finally, throughout everything, we have to learn to let some things go: Don’t Mess with Mr. In-Between. There will always be something we wish we could but cannot control, someone we hope would be our crowd but simply is not. I am a strong believer in fate and often, when something lies in the in-between, it is better left alone. Trust that the world can exist without our hand in every matter, that we can belong in our own happy place without worrying about where every other minuscule thing in the world fits. If we can be grateful for what is in our lives, it’s rare we will give a second thought to what’s not.
I hope to take Crosby’s advice with me into the Thanksgiving holiday and beyond. My first semester of college has shown me beyond a shadow of a doubt that the next seven will not be an easy road, but it is up to me to adjust how I approach my circumstances. We can all benefit from injecting gratitude into our lives, embedding positivity, and stepping away from trivialities to celebrate our place — our belonging — in the world with a fresh perspective.

The only thing about Harvard that’s hard, I was told, is getting in. When I did, my friends said I was twice-lucky: I could go to my dream school and would only have to breeze through four leisurely years to stroll out with a shiny new degree.
They were referring to Harvard’s well-documented grade inflation, on which plenty of publications — including this one — have opined. Pundits and public intellectuals brandish it as evidence that places like Harvard have become more status than substance. These criticisms brush up against genuinely important flaws in American higher education near the top: its obsession with being elite, its sometimes-casual relationship with academic rigor, its willingness to cut corners.
But in this case, they are wrong — egregiously so. If they had asked nearly any student, pundits would know that Harvard is no walk along the Charles. Critics of grade inflation fundamentally misunderstand both this university and what academic rigor really entails. And ironically, in their eagerness to criticize, they defer a more important conversation about the real reason they care about our GPAs: America’s fixation on a handful of elite academic institutions and the powerful resentment it has sown among the swathes of the country who cannot access them.
Yes, in 2013, the most common grade here was an A. While the metric of "most common grade" can paint a misleading picture of the overall grading system, this statistic holds some truth. Eight years later, for many students, it remains neither very hard nor very uncommon to get good grades here.
The critics’ mistruth lies not in the stories they tell but in those they choose to ignore. To spin up narratives from the fact of Harvard’s grade inflation alone dishonestly divorces the story of our time here from everything that had to come before. As more students apply for the same coveted few spots, the path to this school has grown more difficult. To get here requires luck. It often requires privilege. But there are few paths to this school that do not demand both an estimable work ethic and a genuine passion for the pursuit of knowledge.
The intellectual fire kindled from years spent working to defy impossible odds does not sputter out upon arrival in Cambridge. The liveliness of our 24-hour libraries at 2 or 3 a.m. makes it obvious that the Harvard student continues to care. Life here is defined by passion and energy — crowded office hours, darkening eye bags, spirited discussions that carry from lecture hall to the nearest purveyor of caffeine.
If students work hard and care deeply, then surely the way this University evaluates their efforts has little bearing on how well they learn. A grading system does not create a rigorous academic institution; academic rigor, really, begins with a collective intellectual spirit that forms before classes ever begin and would persist if Harvard never handed out an A again.
Why, then, have journalists decades removed from college filled so many pages with pieces on how Harvard grades?
America has an obsession with the elite — celebrities, politicians, the uber-wealthy, and also its best colleges. In a country of competition, these elites are seen as valuable, special, worth aspiring to. Pundits opine on pedagogical choices at Harvard with no bearing on most of the country because there is popular interest in it.
Increasingly, that interest does not come from admiration. In a country of lofty, egalitarian dreams often deferred, elites philosophizing in their ivory towers elicits anger. Colleges like Harvard find themselves in the heat of this tension, still exalted yet becoming a focus of the populist, anti-elite rage that has defined modern politics. This university continues to become a place that people want to hear about and love to hate.
Harvard’s placement as both enclave of the elite and educational institution raises the temperature. Education matters to people. Americans must trust the education system to nurture their kids and to form their adults. Virginia’s recent gubernatorial election, a contest over fundamental questions about education, makes the emotional resonance of how we educate clear. In what we teach, how we teach, and who gets taught stares back at us an honest reflection of America.
In some ways, the reflection of America that Harvard produces should make us uncomfortable. 67 percent of its students come from the top 20 percent of the income distribution. Legacies are accepted at a rate over five times higher than other applicants. Much of the nation looks to Harvard as a burnished dream with the firm, sinking knowledge that it is out of reach.
No wonder people find grade inflation at this university hard to stomach: It seems another clear-cut case of the rich getting richer, propped up on the largesse of status rather than the merit of hard-gotten intellectual rewards. Grade inflation appears just one more example of a system that is thoroughly, irredeemably unfair.
Criticisms of grade inflation mistakenly take a handful of letters to represent a potent educational spirit that goes much deeper. But in perhaps a greater way, they grasp a truth of Harvard we would all do well to admit. If we are to dismiss the criticisms of grade inflation, then we at least owe them the respect and honesty of our consideration — of a look at why people criticize this school. The ivory tower, tall, shining, lonely in its lengthening shadow, will not stop defining this University any time soon. We would do well to gaze outside it.

UPDATED: November 29, 2021 at 4:00 p.m.
Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that consuming less sodium and more potassium is linked to lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Frank Hu, the chair of the Department of Nutrition at HSPH and a senior author of the study, said the project began after his co-author Yuan Ma, an epidemiologist at HSPH, received the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship Award, which has the goal of resolving a major “controversy” in the nutrition field.
Hu said that though studies have long confirmed the link between high sodium intake and poor cardiac health, there has been scientific debate over whether lowering sodium decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
“Not that many studies have looked at the link between sodium and cardiovascular disease directly,” he said. “It’s very difficult to do that type of study because you need a very large number of people, you have to follow them for years or even decades, and you need to have a very reliable measure of sodium intake.”
Such studies typically use a research method called “spot urine” samples, in which urine samples are collected every 24 hours, per the authors. These can be misleading, however, according to Ma, and only relying on daily samples has contributed to controversial findings in past studies.
“The total amount of sodium cannot be reflected in just a spot urine, which may be biased or inaccurate,” Hu said. “In this study we used multiple 24-hour urine samples to measure habitual sodium intake in more than 10,000 people, and then look at sodium intake levels and subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease, which includes heart disease or stroke.”
Ma and Hu collaborated with five cohorts in the United States, along with researchers at Groningen University in the Netherlands and experts from the United Kingdom and Canada in their data collection.
“This is basically teamwork and international collaboration,” Ma said.
Ma and Hu said they hope their research will allow for more effective public health policy surrounding sodium.
“Unfortunately, these controversial findings have largely impeded the implementation of the public health policy on reducing sodium intake,” Ma said. “This has very important public health implications. This issue needs to be clarified before they go further, [before] more actions can be taken on public health policies regarding sodium reduction.”
Ma also noted the importance of effective communication and transparency with the public that the study might provide.
“We feel that for us as researchers, we have the responsibility to deliver results that are from rigorous methods that we feel are reliable and not misleading for the public,” Ma said.
CORRECTION: November 29, 2021
A previous version of this article misquoted Frank Hu as saying the study measured habitual sodium intake in more than 100,000 people. In fact, it was more than 10,000 people.

Harvard scientists discovered the neuroanatomical basis for acupuncture points that trigger a specific anti-inflammatory signaling pathway, advancing the understanding of acupuncture’s therapeutic potential.
The team, led by Harvard Medical School neurobiologists, found the specific type of neuron — “PROKR2-Cre marked sensory neurons” — that must be present for acupuncture to trigger an anti-inflammatory response via the vagal-adrenal axis, a signaling pathway in the nervous system, according to their paper published in Nature last month.
In a study conducted on mice, the researchers showed that the PROKR2-Cre marked neurons only occur in an area of the hindlimb region, explaining why the anti-inflammatory response is not present in other regions of the body.
Senior author of the paper and HMS professor of neurobiology Qiufu Ma said that this discovery will allow scientists to predict the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory acupuncture treatment at different points of the body.
“Most importantly, based on the distribution of this fiber, we can predict where [it] will be effective,” Ma said.
The team was interested in a medical problem known as cytokine storm, which is triggered by diseases such as Covid-19 and cancer. A cytokine storm occurs when our immune response releases too many pro-inflammatory cytokines — small proteins important in cell signaling — which causes “collateral damage” in our bodies, according to Ma.
Ma pointed to a previous discovery which showed that “brief electrical stimulation” of the vagal-adrenal axis — a pathway in which the vagus nerve signals the adrenal gland to release dopamine, which reduces inflammation — via acupuncture increased survival in mice suffering from cytokine storm from 20 percent to around 75 percent.
The team hopes their study can open new doors for the optimization of this anti-inflammatory, therapeutic application of acupuncture, according to co-lead author and postdoctoral fellow Shenbin Liu.
“These findings could pave the way to optimization of bioelectronic stimulation parameters (eg. stimulation intensity, location and depth) to drive distinct autonomic pathways for treating specific diseases, including severe cytokine release syndromes, the management of which remains a major medical challenge,” Liu wrote in an email.
The next step for the team is to use their findings from the animal study and bring them back to a human context, according to Ma.
Ma said that the hope is that the “major nerve organization” between mice and humans is “evolutionary conserved” so that the parameters they discovered in mice can be used as guidance in future clinical studies.

Two Canadian Harvard seniors were awarded the Rhodes Scholarship, the Canadian secretary of the Rhodes Trust announced Sunday, joining the four Harvard seniors announced as American Rhodes Scholars the day before.
Maya Burhanpurkar ’22 and Ramiz A. Razzak ’22 make up two of the 11 Canadian Rhodes recipients and will join over 100 Rhodes scholars from across the globe. The scholarship pays for recipients’ postgraduate studies at Oxford University beginning in October 2022.
Of the 11 Canadian scholars, Harvard and the University of British Columbia each produced two – tying for the highest number from a single school. Seven of the 11 recipients were women, in line with the record-high 22 women of the 32 recipients tapped for the American Rhodes Scholarship.
While the American Rhodes Scholar selection process took place virtually for the second year in a row, the Canadian committee hosted in-person interviews.
“That was actually something that I was super happy about,” Razzak said. “We got to do the whole cocktail event and then the interviews in person, which was just a really, really cool experience.”
“You’re just in a room with all kinds of really, really intelligent and kind people and you realize that once you’re at that stage, it’s a lot of luck involved,” he added. “I consider myself super grateful that it worked out.”
Razzak – who concentrates in Applied Mathematics and Economics with a secondary in Philosophy and hails from Brossard, Quebec – plans to study economic and social history at Oxford.
“One of my favorite quotes from John Maynard Keynes is — the famous economist from the 1920s and 30s – was that, a really good economist has to somehow juggle being a good mathematician, a good philosopher, a good historian, and a good politician or statesperson, and so on,” Razzak said. “That's something that I definitely want to bring to the type of research I do.”
Burhanpurkar — a Physics concentrator with a secondary in Computer Science who hails from Oro-Medonte, Ontario — plans to study theoretical physics, machine learning, and philosophy at Oxford. She said she felt “overwhelming gratitude” for the support she had during the application process.
“I was really grateful to have the opportunity to first study at Harvard, which I never really imagined I would get,” Burhanpurkar said. “I’m even more grateful to have the opportunity to study next fall at Oxford which is — I would have never expected this when I was in high school.”

Ten years after debuting in Harvard Square, the Starbucks located at 1380 Massachusetts Avenue closed on Sunday, with the Harvard Shop set to take its place in 2022.
The closure is the third Starbucks location to leave the Square in recent years. For students who still need to satisfy their Starbucks cravings, the Starbucks store closest to the Square is located at 468 Broadway, near the Harvard Art Museums.
A few days before the Starbucks location officially closed, a sign displayed outside of the shop read, “come CELEBRATE our LAST WEEK with us!” The store also gave out free drinks and food – while supplies lasted – on its final day.
A spokesperson for Starbucks wrote in an email that “after careful consideration,” the store decided to shut down its operations at 1380 Mass. Ave.
“As part of Starbucks standard course of business, we continually evaluate our business to ensure a healthy store portfolio,” the spokesperson, who identified herself only as Allison, wrote.
“As difficult as this was, we must make the right business decisions for the sake of Starbucks’ long-term growth,” she added. “All Starbucks partners (employees) working at that store will have the opportunity to transfer to one of our nearby locations.”
The Harvard Shop, which is affiliated with Harvard Student Agencies, will move into the space previously occupied by Starbucks in the spring of 2022.
Harvard Student Agencies President George C. Guarnieri ’22 and President-Elect Alexander J. Kim ’23 wrote in an email that a Harvard Shop location will be relocating from the Garage, which will be undergoing renovations beginning in June 2022.
Many students mourned the loss of the last Starbucks location in the Square.
Anna G. Farronay ’24 said she used to frequent the Starbucks store “every day.”
“It was part of my morning routine,” she said. “I’m very sad it’s not anymore.”
Farronay said that initially, she did not believe the news about Starbucks closing.
“Starbucks can’t possibly close because it makes so much money. Literally, I am one person that goes there every day or maybe twice a day sometimes, and I’m sure there are other people exactly like me,” she said. “Starbucks makes bank. It’s always packed, it’s always super busy. I don’t understand why they would close.”
Farronay added that she was “legitimately really upset” on Monday morning when she realized that Starbucks had officially closed.
“I called my friend, and I was like, ‘I’m taking a gap year. I can’t do this,’” she said.
Christy Zheng ’25 said the Starbucks closing would “limit” the options available to students to get coffee in the Square.
“I’m not sure what they [will] open there, but I hope that it is something that Harvard students can still be interested in,” she said. “I do think this is a negative thing overall, but hopefully the new business will also be very helpful.”
Alexandria T. Q. Ho ’24, an inactive Crimson FlyBy editor, said that when she was making her college decision, she took the proximity of a Starbucks location to campus into consideration.
“When I was comparing my college options, not that the fact that we have a Starbucks store near Harvard Yard was an actual part in my decision, but I definitely took it into account,” she said.
“The fact that there was a Starbucks – I have a Starbucks addiction, just to clarify – the fact that we had a Starbucks in Harvard Yard made me so happy, and now that we don’t have it anymore, I feel even worse,” Ho added.

Nearly 71 percent of Harvard University students eligible to vote cast ballots in the 2020 election, jumping roughly 9 percentage points from the previous presidential election cycle, according to data released last week by the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement.
NSLVE is a data program run by Tufts University’s Institute for Democracy and Higher Education that helps colleges and universities compile student registration and voting rates to better understand students’ voting habits.
According to its 2020 national report, Harvard University had a 70.6 percent overall eligible student voter turnout rate in the 2020 election and an eligible registration rate of 83.4 percent. Harvard’s overall student turnout rate — which was five percentage points above the national student average — represents a 9.3 percent increase from 2016 and a 19.1 percent increase from 2018.
Harvard students who worked to increase student turnout in the 2020 election celebrated the study’s findings.
Founded in 2018, Harvard Votes Challenge is a student-run and university-wide initiative that is co-run by the Institute of Politics and the Ash Center at the Harvard Kennedy School. HVC aims to expand voter registration, turnout, and civic engagement among University affiliates.
HVC Co-Chair Alexander K. Park '23 said HVC uses a student-oriented outreach model to promote voter turnout on campus. Park pointed to his own experience working with Asian American and Pacific Islander groups at Harvard.
“Encouragement from the president of, say, the Asian American Association, is much more powerful than some random person texting you to vote in the 2020 election,” Park said.
He added Covid-19 had the unintended positive consequence of empowering students to take initiative to navigate the voting process.
“If there’s one silver lining through kind of the pandemic was that a lot of students gained experience in voting in difficult conditions,” Park said.
Kevin L. Ballen '22, a former co-chair of the HVC and current vice president of the Institute of Politics, said HVC specifically tried to promote civic engagement among affinity groups in 2020.
“We did a lot of work with cultural affinity groups across the 2020 election, building a variety of different coalitions and really sort of investing in leaders of these different organizations,” Ballen said.
Per the national student data report, in 2020 voter turnout increased 17 percent among Asian students, 15 percent among Black students, and 13 percent among Hispanic students, compared to 2016 data.
Ballen said he believes colleges can play a substantial role in boosting civic engagement. “We’re in coalitions with our Ivy League peers and with our Boston area peers, so it shows overall a national movement towards colleges really prioritizing civic engagement and voting.”
Ballen said the study confirms that students make up a powerful voter bloc in the electorate.
“Now it’s time to engage us and factor us in when you’re making decisions or when you’re going out in your campaigns because we’re going to show up at the polls and our generation is going to have increasing influence every single year,” he said.
HVC Co-Chair Lily Richman '24 said that despite high voter turnout among Harvard students in the last election cycle, she believes there is still room for growth.
“We want to reach the final twenty-nine percent and we want to make sure that every student who is eligible to vote turns out and votes,” Richman said.

Following the departure last month of the Cambridge Chronicle’s editor and only full-time journalist, Amy Saltzman, former employees and residents have expressed doubts about the future of the U.S.’s oldest surviving weekly newspaper.
Saltzman’s exit comes after years of cutdowns reduced the Chronicle’s staff from a full team of reporters to just one, part of a larger pattern of shrinking newsrooms around the country. The Chronicle announced the hiring of a new editor and reporter, William J. Dowd, on Nov. 17.
Saltzman, who declined an interview, wrote in a Nov. 12 op-ed in the Chronicle that readers should “support local journalism” to help the publication stay afloat.
“The paper’s survival as the oldest continuously run weekly newspaper in the country continues to be against all odds and should be lauded,” Saltzman wrote.
Erin Baldassari, who served as assistant editor, reporter, and photographer under Saltzman until 2014, blamed the Chronicle’s parent company — at the time GateHouse Media — for the paper’s dismantling.
“They don’t really seem to value local news and the people who produce it,” Baldassari said in a recent interview.
According to Baldassari, when she began interning at the Chronicle in 2010, there were three full-time reporters, a number cut in half only two years later.
The staff cutdowns, according to Baldassari, left her with a workload “about as full time as full time can get.”
“When the Boston Marathon bombings hit, I think I worked for 36 hours straight at one point, like overnight and into the next morning,” Baldassari said. “I remember the management told us not to put in for overtime — we should just take comp time for that.”
Dana Forsythe — who worked in a shared Somerville office with Saltzman and Baldassari as the editor of another GateHouse paper, the Watertown TAB — said his experience covering the bombings was “an absolute mess” due to GateHouse’s staff cuts.
“We were kind of just all hands on deck in that office,” Forsythe said. “There was no translation between like, ‘Oh, you’re putting in a ton of work, you know, this is great.’ Like, I remember getting a Dunkin’ Donuts gift card.”
Forsythe added that he received no more than “a couple hours” of overtime pay in his five years at the TAB, and that he “never got a raise” during that period, even amid regular pay cuts.
“I can’t believe Amy stuck in for that long,” Forsythe said. “It’s just not a supportive environment.”
In 2019, GateHouse merged with Gannett to create the largest newspaper conglomerate in the U.S. — the company took the Gannett name due to better brand recognition.
According to NiemanLab, at the time of the merger, the new company controlled one-sixth of all print newspapers in the country.
Despite the change in ownership, Baldassari said she is not optimistic about the Chronicle’s future, as it has yet to replace the reporter position cut during her time there.
“If they never decided to hire a reporter to fill the former reporter’s shoes, you’re not interested in staffing up a paper,” Baldassari said. “I can’t imagine that things are going to improve.”
A Gannett spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that the organization prides itself on “fostering a supportive work environment” where “all employees are valued.”
“While we can’t speak to the past issues, Gannett is deeply committed to local journalism and to our employees,” the spokesperson wrote. “We are working steadfastly to ensure the future of local journalism and continue to keep our communities informed.”
Dowd — who is moving from his role as editor of the Salem Gazette and Swampscott Reporter — said in a statement through Gannett that his first priority as the Chronicle’s new editor is to build a relationship with the city of Cambridge.
“I think listening is the best course of action right now,” Dowd said. “I have devoted the last decade of my career to community journalism, and am looking forward to directing the Cambridge Chronicle's coverage into the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the collegiate crew teams that consider the Charles River their home turf, the fall season concluded on Nov. 13 with one last row on familiar waters.
The Foot of the Charles Regatta, hosted by the Harvard and Radcliffe teams, is the much smaller autumn finale that follows October’s global Head of the Charles.
There were four races in total: both the men and women had a “four” and an “eight”, where each boat racing has four and eight rowers, respectively. All four of Harvard’s crew teams were well represented, facing little outside competition.
MEN'S HEAVYWEIGHT AND LIGHTWEIGHT
The only non-Harvard entry in the men’s contest was Northeastern, which only has a heavyweight squad.
The first race of the day was the men’s four, with all three teams entering four separate boats ranked A, B, C and D within their respective programs. The “A boat” is the most competitive boat of each program, their “A team” of rowers. The other boats follow in order, the “B boat” the next most capable, and so on.
In the men’s heavyweight competition, Northeastern’s A boat placed first, completing the course in 12:35. The Huskies were followed by the four Harvard heavyweight boats, who finished in alphabetical order within a sub-35-second span between one another.
The Lightweights’ A boat was preceded by Northeastern’s B and followed by its C, then the rest of the Harvard lightweight boats in the order of B, D then C. Northeastern’s D boat finished in the basement.
In the men’s eight, the Harvard heavyweights entered four boats, ranked A through D. The Crimson lightweights raced three, A through C, and Northeastern only one A boat on the heavyweight side.
The Harvard heavyweight A and B boats took first and second, finishing in 11:36 and 11:43, respectively. Northeastern ended in third with a time of 12:07. The field was rounded out by Harvard: the heavyweight C, next Lightweights A then B, followed by the final Harvard heavyweight and lightweight boats, respectively.
“Overall, a terrific team-wide result demonstrating good depth,” Charles Butt, the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew coach, wrote in an email. “Losing at the top end is tough, but it’s early in the year, and the team always responds well to challenges.”
WOMEN'S HEAVYWEIGHT AND LIGHTWEIGHT
The Radcliffe women had more competition over the weekend. Boston University, Boston College, Northeastern, and the University of Rhode Island all participated in the races. Among the visitors, Boston University was the only one that entered lightweight boats in addition to their heavyweights.
Twenty-eight boats faced off in the women’s eight. The Radcliffe heavies contributed four boats, ranked A through D within the program, and the lights added two, A and B. Each Radcliffe team also entered a novice boat of ameatur rowers that has been training this semester hoping to integrate into the respective programs.
The lightweight A was the first Harvard-affiliated boat to finish, taking fourth place in an impressive 13:32. The heavyweight A boat was less than a second behind, claiming fifth. The Heavyweight B finished ninth, the C 10th, and D 21st. The Lightweight B finished in 12th.
The Radcliffe heavyweight novice finished 25th overall and first among the other novices, while the lightweight novice took 27th overall and third for the amateurs.
The final race of the day was the women’s four, which only had three boats. Boston University placed first, rowing the course in 15:58, next the Radcliffe lightweights in 16:25, and finally the Radcliffe heavyweight novices in 18:27.
Sophomores Ava Sack and Ryan Swastrom rowed in the Lightweight A eight boat.
“The Foot of the Charles was a way to show how we could compete in an open weight category, so we were really excited to show our speed there and how we’ve worked on improvements throughout the season,” Sack said.
“We were just focusing this season on being positive and getting our feet back on the ground,” Swastrom added. “It was exciting to show how much improvement we’ve made and we’re going to keep getting faster for next season.”
UP NEXT
The Foot of the Charles marked the official end to all four of the Harvard and Radcliffe teams’ fall seasons. As the semester comes to an end, they continue to train and prepare for their primary spring seasons. At the end of winter recess, they will all embark on a training trip to Sarasota, Fla.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend the women’s volleyball team finished out its season, losing to Brown (20-4, 13-1 Ivy League) and Yale (16-7, 9-5) with scores of 3-0 and 3-2, respectively. The Crimson’s 10-13, 7-7 record is a marked improvement from its previous season’s record of 5-18, 2-10 in 2019.
“We really showed our improvement from the beginning to the end [of the season],” said sophomore outside hitter Katie Vorhies.
Vorhies’ contribution to the team’s success was undeniable, as she tallied 266 kills over the 23-game season, hitting double-digit kill counts in all but six games. Along with Vorhies was junior co-captain attacker Jaimie Rao, who led the team in kills with 278. The duo contributed almost half of the team’s 1170 kills. Vorhies’ and Rao’s offensive efforts were supplemented by sophomore hitters Nicole Prescott and Olivia Cooper.
Harvard started its season with a string of weekend tournaments, going 3-6 before beginning Ivy League play. Wins against Merrimack (0-29, 0-14 Northeast Conference), Howard (18-12, 12-2 MEAC), and American (19-14, 11-5 Patriot League) and a tight 3-2 loss to No. 13 Oregon (20-8, 11-7 PAC-12) were bright spots in this first third. Vorhies particularly noted the energy and competitiveness the Crimson brought to the match against the Ducks.
Inexperience and trial-and-error dominated as the Crimson struggled to find its footing in the start of the season.
“We had an interesting dynamic this year, as half of the team was completely new,” Vorhies said. “In the beginning of the season we had a lot of talent, and we were still trying to put it together.”
Although many players had never played in a college match, this naivety did not deter them from making contributions. For example, first-year libero Lindsey Zhang dominated Harvard’s defensive game throughout the season.
“[Zhang] did a great job,” Vorhies said. “She was a really solid player in every single game, and that was really important. I think it can be hard to step into a leadership role like that as a freshman, and she did it right from the beginning. We’re all really proud of her for that.”
Zhang led the team in digs with 329, and Prescott and first-year setter Rocky Aguirre followed with 149 and 136, respectively. Cooper and sophomore blocker Ariana White contributed 80 and 74 blocks as well.
Zhang, Prescott, Aguirre, Cooper, and White had never played for the Crimson before this year.
As the new players began to integrate into the team with the support of upperclassmen, Harvard saw success as it entered Ivy League play for the bulk of its season.
“By the middle and end of the season we saw each other develop into a fierce, competitive group and were working really well with each other,” Vorhies said. “We were intense and competitive, and it was really cool to see us have that growth.”
After its 3-6 start, the team went 7-7 against the Ancient Eight. The Crimson displayed strong showings in both home and away matches throughout the middle of the season, evening its record at 9-9 before dropping three of its last four matches.
The attrition of the long season and injuries could explain why Harvard could not continue its success and close out the season on a high.
“It was a tough season because we did have a lot of injuries,” Vorhies said. “We had people playing through injuries, we had people out with injuries. Almost every single person had an injury at some point.”
For instance, sophomore setter and hitter Ashley Wang went down in early October with an ankle injury. She missed a month of competition but still managed to end her truncated season with 145 kills and 123 digs.
Although the Crimson looks forward to next year’s season with all of its players returning, a year’s worth of experience under its belt, and new skills and chemistry, Vorhies noted that the team benefited from the leadership of senior attacker Julia Beckmann. Beckmann was not able to compete in the season due to medical reasons.
“[Beckmann] was always cheering us on from the bench and supported us from the background,” Vorhies said. “It’s really important. It can be hard sometimes if you’re not able to be on the court to be engaged and contribute to conversations, and she did a great job of that all year.”
Nevertheless, the team is excited to improve on the success it enjoyed this year.
“I am looking forward to playing those tough games that we lost in the fifth set, like to Princeton, Yale and Brown,” Vorhies said. “Those were teams we were really close with. I’m really excited because our team is not only talented, but we also have that competitive drive and chemistry which is something unique. I think next year we could do really well.”

Love It: My Entertainment on the Way to the Writing Center - Hailey Krasnikov
Listen, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t concerned about the turkeys attacking me. I will also admit that I wait for them to waddle at least 10 feet away before walking through the gate into the Yard. But the turkeys are also free entertainment. My walks to the Writing Center would be gloomy without them. Nothing more incredible seeing a turkey standing in the road, unphased, while a car is honking at it. Anything brave enough to stand up to a Boston driver has my utmost respect. And it’s impossible not to find bikers having to swerve around the turkeys at least a little funny. They own Mass. Ave. — no question about it.
But the entertainment isn’t all the turkeys have to offer. You know that awkward moment when someone is walking in the opposite direction as you and you have that help-which-direction-do-I-go-in face off and then stare at them in panic? Enter the turkeys: a welcome distraction giving you something to look at, so you can quickly break eye contact and pass by that person!
It happened to me just last week. Imagine this: You’re walking back from the Writing Center after the tutor just tore up your entire paper (not literally, but it hurt just as much) and now you’re a little sad. And now there’s a stranger that you keep making eye contact with walking towards you. Fear not! The turkeys that have no common sense are here! And just like that you see a turkey fan its feathers out. You forget about your paper and avoid awkward eye contact with the person walking by you because you’re too busy appreciating your turkey in all its glory. Blessed be the turkeys. But, hey, edit that paper ASAP.
Hate It: Getting Chased on my Way to the Writing Center - Hayeon “Rachel” Ok
My worst nightmare is getting chased by a turkey. Imagine casually walking down Mass. Ave. when a gobbling figure comes speeding towards you (not unlike the deadline on your CS pset, get that done!!). I once had a scarring experience of seeing a turkey chase down a tourist despite their best efforts to scare it off. Perhaps turkeys are good for controlling the number of tourists on campus, but I still shudder to imagine myself in that situation. It’s especially frightening when a crowd of turkeys is wandering about, seemingly conspiring on how best to choose their next victim.
Imagine the Writing Center scenario again: you are walking back to your dorm after hearing harsh criticism about your paper when you see a turkey heading in your direction. In addition to fearing for your grade, you now have to fear for your life.
Also, there’s something disturbing about seeing a turkey walk by on your way to the dhall and then seeing one again on your plate during lunch. Of course, that’s not a true reason to hate turkeys (maybe they’re so fast because they’ve had practice running from HUDS…), but a strange feeling arises from seeing a live and deceased turkey within minutes from each other.

With Thanksgiving Break just around the corner and the end of the semester a block or two past that, Flyby wanted to share what this semester has made us thankful for at Harvard.
Being on Campus 
In 2019, living in Cambridge would be a given for a Harvard student. But after doing more than a year of college, high school, or gap years virtually, we know that even something as simple as being here merits appreciation. We see now that there’s something so special about the spontaneity and genuineness that come with on-campus interactions, even if we can’t Zoom into 9 a.m.’s from bed anymore.
Our Community
Perhaps the best part of being on campus has been the proximity that we have to everyone. Even though communal bathrooms and bunk beds can sometimes be ~less than ideal~, we’re grateful for the friends in our dorm we can come to at 1 a.m. when we need a tea bag, someone to pset with, or just a hug. We appreciate our classmates who share in our confusion during lecture and who’ll proofread our essays an hour before the deadline. And we’re thankful for all the TFs and professors who come in every day to share their knowledge and love of learning with us, who listen to our never-ending questions during office hours, and who don’t judge us for our constant requests for extensions.
The Weather
Weather may be more of a con than a pro for Cambridge, but we are thankful that it’s been a little gentle to us this year, with November seeing more 60-degree weather days than snow days. And even if Cambridge weather is still quite unpredictable, hey, at least it lets us show off a wide range of items from our closets.
HUDS
Whether with a bowl of chili, a fresh Veritaffle, or a sundae on Sunday, HUDS does its best to fill our stomachs and warm our hearts. We’re grateful to the HUDS workers who are always ready to find an extra takeout box, help us clean up broken plates after unfortunate lunch line crashes, or even just share smiles with us. And when we’re sick, HUDS’ never-ending supply of tea is the next best thing to our moms’ TLC back home.
Handling of Covid-19 
The pandemic is still very much impacting everyday life across the globe, so in the midst of all this, we’re thankful for the precautions Harvard has put in place to keep all of us safe. We’re also thankful for how proactive the community has been at following those precautions. We know testing twice a week and having to attend lectures and midterms in masks is not anyone’s ideal college experience, so we appreciate the contributions that each member of the Harvard community makes every day to keep us all safe.
That We Don’t Go to Y*le
Imagine going to a school that not only studies for Covid-19 tests but loses in the last 30 seconds of a football game. We’re grateful that’s not us. All we do is win, while all the bulldogs can do is bark.
Be it the fruit flies in Adams, needing to actually budget time to commute to classes, or relearning how to socialize after a year of isolation, this first fully on-campus semester comes with its own set of challenges. Still, we’re thankful for you and proud that you’ve made it this far.
