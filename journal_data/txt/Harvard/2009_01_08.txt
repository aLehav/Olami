After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tuesday’s spectacle on Capitol Hill reminded us that politics, at its most basic level, boils down to questions of force: Roland W. Burris may call himself the junior senator from Illinois, but an armed man in uniform stood between the former Illinois attorney general and his seat in the Senate chamber. Yet given the circumstances surrounding Burris’ questionable appointment, Senate Democrats should be doing everything in their power to keep it that way.While Governor Rod R. Blagojevich may technically hold the executive power in Illinois for the time being, his decision to make an appointment to the very seat he is under investigation for auctioning off is preposterous. Democratic leadership was right in originally attempting to stall Burris’ inauguration, and they should have continued to do so long enough for Blagojevich’s impeachment proceedings to fully run their course. Instead, party leaders conceded on Wednesday to clear a path for Burris provided that he receives the endorsement of the Illinois secretary of state and demonstrates to Illinois legislators on Thursday that no impropriety tainted his appointment. These conditions miss the point. Even if Burris was not involved in any shady dealings, the allegations against Blagojevich call the governor’s judgment into question. Blagojevich has potentially violated the public trust upon which his power to make such a decision rests. Under these circumstances, no one the governor appoints can be considered a credible representative of Illinois, especially if party leaders are reluctant to work with him. Contrary to what Burris’ supporters may think, there is no such thing as a “legitimate appointment from an illegitimate governor.” Moreover, Burris’ decision to accept Blagojevich’s nomination reflects poorly on his own character. If Burris does, as he alleges, have the interests of Illinois in mind,  then he should ensure that the legitimacy of the state’s senate seat is undisputed, even if this means relinquishing his nomination. Sadly, it seems that Burris will continue in his refusal to subordinate his own political ambitions to this higher end. Indeed, one must wonder whether Blagojevich selected Burris knowing that he was one of the few candidates who would accept the nomination from an allegedly corrupt governor.We are therefore thankful that Illinois’ secretary of state could block the nomination in his refusal to certify it. While the secretary should not have veto power over gubernatorial appointments under normal circumstances, this situation seems extraordinary enough to warrant this check on the Governor. We hope that the Supreme Court of Illinois will intervene to clarify conditions under which such intervention may be legal. We recognize the need for this situation to be resolved a swiftly as possible, but haste is no substitute for legitimacy. Five of the past 10 Illinois governors have faced criminal charges, and 79 of the state’s elected officials have been convicted of a crime since 1972.  Illinoisans have already seen more than their share of corrupt politicians, and at the very least they deserve representation that is not marred with controversy from the start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Raúl Castro understands Charles Dickens’ reference to the best of times and the worst of times. At long last it was Raúl’s turn, as Cuba’s president, to preside over the anniversary that marked half a century at the country’s helm. Fifty years and eleven U.S. presidents ago, his brother Fidel and he led a ragtag rebel force to improbable victory in early January 1959. Yet, days before this event, it was also Raúl’s turn to preside over the session of the Cuban National Assembly to enact a new social security law—an act that symbolizes what has gone well and badly over the past half century.
Cuba needed a new law on pensions for the best of reasons. Cuba’s life expectancy had increased. Cubans live on average as long as Europeans or North Americans. Such heightened life expectancy summarizes many of Cuba’s achievements of the past half-century. Fewer infants die at birth in Havana than in Washington, DC. Over the decades Cubans acquired better access to nutrition, curative and preventive health care free of charge, schooling to obtain the information needed to lead healthier lives, options for physical exercise in state-supported athletics and sports, and all under conditions of sufficient equality to permit a broad universal advance. It was the best of times in many ways.
Such success, however, has also had adverse consequences—what in the United States would be called a massive problem of unfunded pension liabilities. The old law permitted retirement for women at age 55 and for men at age 60. The new law increases those ages to 60 and 65, respectively. The impact of longer life expectancy on retirement plans is common in Europe and Japan. However, Cuba is different because, unlike Europe or Japan, it is a rapidly aging but poor country. Plus, unlike China, which is about to age rapidly as well, Cuba lacks a reliable economic growth path of its own that would not depend on external subsidies, which in recent years have come from Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela.
During the same session of the National Assembly, government officials announced with pride that the minimum pension, which is what many retired Cubans receive, had risen to the equivalent of $8.33 per month. True, access to health care is free, but the elderly still have to purchase medicines, which are often missing or in short supply in pharmacies and may only be purchased with “convertible pesos”—Cuban currency, equivalent to dollars or euros—used to purchase goods or services at international prices that are quoted also in euro or dollar equivalents. The elderly must also buy food, yet the rationing card covers only about half of a month’s supply of food, so convertible pesos are needed as well. The insufficiency of Cuba’s economic growth helps to explain the hardship that many Cubans must bear every day.
Cuba’s social security law should have been changed years ago. Long ago, Cuba’s excellent demographers had identified this demographic transition. Cuba’s population actually fell in 2006 and again in 2007 (while slightly rising in 2008) but the forecasts about the rapid aging predate these years. Why, then, was there no change sooner? Fidel Castro had the power to enact such a change but proved allergic to this and other reforms. It fell to Raúl Castro to have the guts to enact this change during his first year as president and to do so on the same year when the world economy collapsed, hitting Cuba hard as it has other countries—the worst of times.
The approach followed to enact the social security reform is noteworthy. The July 2008 National Assembly session enacted a preliminary bill that the population would discuss. At the December 2008 National Assembly session, the Labor Minister reported that 99.1 percent of the 3,057,568 participants in assemblies convened to discuss the bill had approved it. This was no doubt aided by the government’s full use of its ownership and operation of all the mass media to defend the policy changes in the absence of counterarguments. Nor should there be doubt that the substantive policy change was necessary. But surely the minister should have blushed. Did he really believe that a policy change of this magnitude, bitterly divisive in most democratic countries, would have obtained such an unbelievably high rate of approval? It was laudable to promote a public national debate about the change but regrettable that the government succumbed, once again, to a half-century legacy of authoritarianism hidden behind a pretended unanimity.
During the past half century, Cuba has had varied and complex experiences. The National Assembly’s December 2008 plenary session, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the current political regime, brought together much of the good and the bad of these decades, as well as the silly and the imprudent. Yet it is evident that Cuba’s new president is prepared to take on some statesmanlike, albeit unpopular, decisions for the sake of sounder governance. What other courageous steps might he be willing to undertake in 2009?

President Bush’s legacy, for all intents and purposes, may be sleeping with the fishes. In an unscientific survey of 109 historians, 61 percent of them ranked Bush the worst president in history—a number that undoubtedly would be higher if James Buchanan had mastered that whole leave-the-country-in-one-piece-when-you-exit-office thing.  Furthermore, the populace outside the Ivory Tower seems to agree. Last December, a USA-Today Gallup poll indicated that 67 percent of Americans disapprove of Bush’s job as President, and a NBC-Wall Street Journal poll reported that a mere 18 percent of Americans will miss him when he leaves office. 
There’s not much to miss if one pauses to think about the past eight years. Bush has presided over two wars, an economic crisis, the drowning of New Orleans, obscene amounts of governmental cronyism, and a bitter culture war dividing the country into Red and Blue states. But hope springs eternal. If life gives you lemons, then make lemonade. In President Bush’s case, if your legacy is sleeping with the fishes, then embrace the fishes.
And this is literally just what Bush has done. Last Tuesday, the President designated three new stretches of the Pacific as Marine National Monuments, which effectively bans commercial fishing, seafloor mining, oil exploration, and other commercial exploitation.  The act builds upon Bush’s 2006 decree that created a similar monument near the Northern Hawaiian islands, Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (which seems to have a syllable for each of its 139,800 square miles). At the time, Papahanaumokuakea was the largest patch of ocean ever preserved, a record broken only by Tuesday’s act, which encompasses 195,280 square miles of pristine marine sites including the Mariana Trench, Rose Atoll, and a string of uninhabited islands and reefs.   If Kanye West ever spent sleepless nights wondering whether or not President Bush cares about fish, then his worries should be put to rest. 
In total, Bush has protected an oceanic area larger than Texas, a rare act worthy of praise in an administration with a dismal record of environmental stewardship—from refusing to sign the Kyoto Protocol  to recently pushing through midnight regulations that allow coal-power plants to be built nearer to national parks.  While it may be true that Bush “has done more to protect unique areas of the world’s oceans than any other person in history” as Joshua Reichert, managing director of the Pew Environmental Group, told the New York Times on Monday, giving the President the title “Lord Neptune, King of the Seas” may be too hasty. This policy, like so many other good policies of the Bush Administration, will ultimately fall victim to earlier policy blunders—this time, specifically, Bush’s unwillingness to act on climate change during his presidency.
While carbon-dioxide levels and coral reefs may seem unrelated, the fate of the world’s oceans and the level of our carbon output are inextricably tied together. As carbon levels in the atmosphere increase, the world’s ocean water becomes more acidic. These more acidic waters have a direct, detrimental effect on coral growth.  Moreover, acidic waters reduce the survival of animals with calcium-carbonate shells or skeletons, like krill. The killing off of animals that occupy a low level in the marine food chain undermines the chain and can destabilize entire oceanic ecosystems.  In the end, these atmospheric changes from greenhouse gases have the potential to be catastrophic for the same fragile reef systems that Bush vowed to protect on Tuesday. As Brendan Cummings, oceans program director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told the BBC, “Unless we deal with global warming, all other protective measures for coral reefs will be rendered meaningless.” 
The ultimate flaw in Bush’s ocean policy is the belief that the oceans can be protected piecemeal—an approach that stems from terrestrial conservation. On land, protecting sites in patches can be successful. For example, cutting down trees around Yellowstone will not immediately harm the trees within Yellowstone. The oceans, however, are different because water and life move freely without the same geographic restraints as on land—illustrated by the fact that ocean currents bring in thousands of pounds of garbage from nearby islands into the protected Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument.  Regardless of well-intentioned efforts like creating marine sanctuaries, oceanic environments will never be protected until we tackle the larger issues facing oceans as a whole, such as pollution, overfishing, and atmospheric carbon.
Despite these flaws, President Bush has made a noble effort to protect the aquatic world. However, his pioneering steps should be the first, not the last, as future administrations supplement his efforts with a more holistic approach to protecting the seas.  With time, some of the sting of even this President’s failures will be tempered by the legacy he leaves with his deep blue heart.

The players get set with 5:21 left in the game. Alabama is down 28 to 17, and driving. They have the ball on their own 37-yard-line. It is second down, four yards to go.  Quarterback John Parker Wilson stands poised in the shotgun formation. Three receivers are stacked on his right, one on his left. All hope for a Crimson Tide victory rests on a score in this drive. 
The ball is hiked. Wilson drops back to the 28-yard-line and looks right. He sees an open man. On his arm rests the hopes of entire season. But the problem lies not in what Wilson sees, but in what he does not see.
Utah defensive back Sean Smith is charging from Wilson’s blind side. As Wilson steps into his throw he exposes himself and Smith pounces. The Alabama QB collapses. Fumble.
As if destiny had willed it, the ball bounced a few yards into the welcoming arms of Utah linebacker Stevenson Sylvester. He recovered the ball and in doing so ended Alabama’s season. As the crowd roared, Sylvester picked up the ball and celebrated, running in a crouch with his palms facing the ground and pumping his arms as if he were double-dribbling. The act lasted less than three seconds, but a flag was thrown. Sylvester was charged with a personal foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
I couldn’t believe it. The lowly Utes of the University of Utah had defeated the seemingly unstoppable Crimson Tide from Alabama—and there was a flag on the field. I couldn’t get over the absurd penalty call, and it got me thinking that the NCAA needs to abandon their draconian rules regarding ‘excessive’ celebration.
The Utes got no respect for an entire season because they weren’t from a big-name conference. All the while, these players were up at the crack of dawn and in bed by a curfew on top of their schoolwork, striving to improve. The suspense of a big bowl-game upset was resolved with this climactic recovery. After the fumble, Sylvester was on top of the world. Wouldn’t you celebrate? (I, for one, am glad there are no referees present when students are informed they get into Harvard because there might not be enough flags for all the personal foul penalties.)
The ecstatic linebacker did not talk trash, did not taunt anyone, and did not hit anyone. He just reacted to the realization of his, and the entire team’s, football dreams. There is much to be said for preserving a spirit of respect in college sports, win or lose, but the NCAA shouldn’t include Sylvester’s celebration under the mantle of disrespectful behavior. This was not unsportsmanlike conduct, but unbridled joy. And a young athlete’s joy, and sense of achievement, should never earn him or her a penalty. 
Student-athletes are not paid; they are not vying for a contract extension or to increase their market price as a free agent. Many, as the NCAA likes to say, will turn pro “in something other than sports.” When a human being puts him or herself through the crucible that a sport can be, subjects him or herself to the mental and physical discipline and sacrifice, and puts his or her body on the line without a paycheck in sight, something deeper is at work. When I was growing up, we called this “the love of the game.”
And increasingly, this love is the last pure thing the NCAA can protect. Despite their many policies and restrictions, money has saturated college sports. With prestigious programs paying millions for coaches and millions more for stadiums and television deals, it has never been more important to encourage playing sports for sports’ sake.
Of course, the penalty didn’t mean much, and if Mr. Sylvester lost any sleep that night, it wasn’t because he was kicking himself. But as student-athletes secure larger, longer contracts out of school and as scouts even turn their attention to high school prospects, the last thing we need is less authentic, respectful celebration. Instead of discouraging manifestations of joy and excitement on the field, the NCAA should applaud them as true elements of sport that remain in an association that becomes more commercial with each passing season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For years, astronomers have thought that the Milky Way was a weak sister to the neighboring Andromeda galaxy in both the size and mass. 
But last Monday, Mark J. Reid of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics overturned this decades-long belief at the American Astronomical Society’s convention in Long Beach, California.
In a recently-released study, Reid and his colleagues used the Very Long Baseline Array to map the Milky Way in a more accurate, multi-dimensional way. 
They proved that it is 15 percent larger and 50 percent more massive than previously hypothesized. The galaxy also appears to be spinning about 15 percent faster than traditionally argued.
Reid, a five-foot-five, 140-pound astrophysicist, said the difference in estimated size was the cosmic equivalent of him suddenly bulking up to the size of a six-foot-three, 210-pound NFL linebacker.
“Previously we thought Andromeda was dominant, and that we were the little sister of Andromeda,” Reid said. “But now it’s more like we are fraternal twins.”
The VLBA is a system of 10 radio telescopes scattered across and around North America that together provide a higher level of accuracy for astronomical measurements than previously available.
“These measurements use the traditional surveyor’s method of triangulation and do not depend on any assumptions based on other properties, such as brightness, unlike earlier studies,” said Karl M. Menten of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, a member of Reid’s team.
The telescopes’ antennae measured the brightest new stars in the Milky Way. Rather than just noting the locations where they were first observed, the scientists included the dimension of time in their cosmic map—something Reid said hasn’t been done before.
But our galaxy being larger than we thought is not necessarily the best news. According to the researchers, a bigger Milky Way means that we could be crashing violently into the Andromeda galaxy sooner than we believed—though that’s still billions of years from now.

Amid layoffs throughout the print media industry, at least one publication is hiring.
The Harvard Business Review has chosen Adi Ignatius, a deputy managing editor at Time Magazine, to be its next editor-in-chief, its publisher announced Tuesday. The post had been vacant since June.
Ignatius, who will begin in his new position on Jan. 19, said he welcomes the opportunity to educate a growing audience.
“I look forward to working with Harvard Business Review’s staff and authors to build on the magazine’s great editorial legacy and to create content that’s newly relevant and accessible to today’s global business audience,” Ignatius said in a statement.
The Business Review focuses on management issues and is well known in the business community for introducing new ideas in the field.
At Time, Ignatius oversaw the magazine’s business and international coverage. He previously worked as the editor of Time Asia and as a bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal.
In recent months, Time has significantly shrunk its newsroom in order to cut costs.
With new leadership, the Business Review, founded in 1922, is planning changes to adapt to the increasing importance of online resources. According to a statement, the magazine’s Web site will be redesigned in the coming weeks and it will begin offering an online-only subscription.
According to colleagues, Ignatius is well liked and respected at Time.
Elaine Shannon, a former Time correspondent, said that the Business Review is lucky to have him.
“He is a smart editor, very creative, and he can meet a deadline,” Shannon said.
In an e-mail to Time staff announcing Ignatius’ departure, Managing Editor Rick Stengel praised his “encyclopedic knowledge that spanned everything from international affairs to popular culture.” Shannon said that one of Ignatius’ greatest strengths is his ability to use his knowledge to improve stories.
“He is so facile in the way he makes them all relevant,” Shannon said. “He is an asset for a distinguished publication.”

Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75 will lead President-elect Barack Obama’s efforts to reform government regulation and the regulatory process, according to media reports.
Sunstein will head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a little-known body that oversees new agency regulations that largely fell by the way-side as the Bush administration advanced a deregulatory agenda. 
During the presidential contest, Obama campaigned on the promise to reform a regulatory system that he claimed was partly to blame for the current economic crisis.
As regulatory czar, Sunstein will be charged with overseeing the federal government’s regulatory standards in areas like the environment, consumer safety, and health. In addition, Sunstein may also review new regulations to reform the financial services industry. 
From 2001 to 2006, the position was held by Harvard professor John D. Graham, the founder of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, who drew fire from environmental and public-safety organizations for his support of deregulation.
“It’s extremely important to have an office that can rationalize the regulatory process,” said Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62, a friend of both Obama and Sunstein. “Just an orgy of regulation for regulation’s sake is not what we need right now.”
Sunstein, an academic “superstar” and the most-cited American legal scholar, brings a keen intellect and a deep understanding of the behavioral sciences that will allow him to tailor regulation to human behavior, said Tribe, who employed Obama as a research assistant during his time at law school.
Obama and Sunstein first met on the faculty at the University of Chicago Law School and have forged a close friendship since then. Sunstein, who left Chicago for Harvard last year, advised Obama on legal matters throughout his campaign. In fact, Sunstein met his current wife, Harvard Kennedy School professor Samantha Power, while both were advising the Obama campaign.
Last year, Sunstein co-authored the book “Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness” that proposed “choice-architecture,” or the structuring of situations so that individuals make better choices. 
Sunstein is expected to bring this behavioral perspective to his new role crafting regulation, Tribe said.
In a brief phone interview, Sunstein, a Boston native, declined to confirm whether he would be appointed head of the regulatory body and would not comment beyond saying, “Wherever I go, I am and shall always be a Boston Red Sox fan.”
Obama, a Law School graduate, has poached top talent from Harvard in recent weeks; Sunstein is the fifth Harvard academic to depart for Washington. 
Law School Dean Elena Kagan is in line to become Obama’s solicitor general, the third-ranking official in the Justice Department; former University President Lawrence H. Summers will lead his National Economic Council; Harvard Kennedy School professor John P. Holdren, an expert on climate change, will lead the administration’s science policy; and geneticist Eric S. Lander, the head of the Harvard-MIT Broad Institute, will chair Obama’s science and technology advisory council.

The College Board has introduced a new policy that will allow students to choose which SAT Reasoning test scores they submit to colleges. The policy, Score Choice, will take effect in March, and so will be operational when current high school juniors apply to college next year. 
Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that Harvard admissions will embrace the Score Choice policy and he believes that it will reduce stress among applicants. 
“I think there are people who might end up doing better on the test if they realize this won’t part of their permanent record,” Fitzsimmons said in an interview on Monday. “I think the whole idea is this policy lets students step back a little...and own their own scores. They took the test and went through the process...and ultimately they should make the decision about whether or not to send the scores to the colleges.”
Fitzsimmons added that since Harvard counts each of a student’s highest subscores—in Critical Reading, Mathematics, and Writing—it might still be advantageous to report more than one score.
But acceptance of Score Choice has not been uniform among the nation’s top universities, leaving it unclear what effect, if any, the policy will have on the admissions scene.
“I think one of the difficult parts of this policy is that it is shining more light on testing and that doesn’t reduce stress,” said University of Pennsylvania Dean of Admissions Eric J. Furda. “This is an unfortunate consequence of Score Choice by putting testing on front page of the newspaper.” 
Furda said that he is not convinced that allowing students to choose one score to submit from multiple sittings will reduce stress associated with the test.
“Am I going to be less stressed taking this test five times and only sending it once? I don’t know,” Furda said. “We are going to ask students to submit their entire testing history. We feel this is in students’ best interests. Having more information in this highly selective process is much better than having less data.”
Not all students will be able to take advantage of College Board’s new policy. For students from less-affluent backgrounds who rely on the College Board’s fee waiver, College Board will still only waive the fee a maximum of two times.
“The College Board doesn’t support excessive test taking,” said College Board spokeswoman Alana Klein. “Research has shown that students see very insignificant score improvements upon retaking the test more than twice.”
Both Fitzsimmons and Furda stressed that, Score Choice policy aside, the admissions process is about far more than standardized test scores. 
“We have always had the policy that we will take the highest score whenever it occurs,” Fitzsimmons said. “Whether students use score choice or send every single test they’ve ever taken it’s actually not going to change the way we look at their test.” 
Furda agreed, saying, that even though UPenn will have “a different policy than Harvard, at the end of the day we are still motivated by the same things and make informed decisions in our applicant pool.”

Despite University President Drew G. Faust’s announcement in December that Harvard might slow down the timeline for parts of the Allston expansion, the University closed a deal the day after Christmas that added an additional piece of land to its current real estate holdings, according to an e-mail statement obtained by The Crimson.
“The process surrounding the acquisition began many months ago,” Harvard spokeswoman Lauren Marshall said. “When real estate opportunities arise and are presented to us, we consider them carefully.”
The property, which is adjacent to Harvard’s planned site for the relocated Charlesview Apartments, sits at 90 Antwerp St., Brighton and is currently occupied by the Brookline Machine Company. The company, which has used the building since 1949 to conduct hydraulic and transmission machine work, will “remain on site” despite the transaction. 
Even though the property may have no short-term use, Harvard has invested in real estate contiguous to existing holdings because they meet some need for long-term institutional growth or support the university’s mission. In line with its traditional method of acquiring real estate in Allston, Harvard did not directly receive the property from Brookline Machine Company.
According to city records, Harvard Real Estate-Allston merged with another company, Crown Mechanic LLC, on Dec. 26. John S. Whiting, the registered agent for Crown and the head of Brookline Machine, chartered Crown on Dec. 11. After Crown had been created, he filed on Dec. 14 to give Harvard the rights to execute all transfers of real estate and deeds in Crown’s name.
While Marshall declined to comment on the specifics of the transaction and the price of the transaction was not disclosed in records, Harvard Business School professor Arthur I. Segel said that real estate buyers and sellers’ use of separate corporations to transfer real estate is “not out of the ordinary” and may be used by buyers to shield their other assets from liability claims after the transfer.
“This is the convention to limit downside exposure on any one investment,” Segel said. “The seller may also use corporations to insulate him or herself from any liability going through with the new owner.”
Harry Mattison, a member of the Harvard Allston Task Force who runs a blog that has featured discussion of Harvard’s purchases in the past, voiced concerns about the transparency of such acquisition techniques.
“It obscures the true value of the sale, and I don’t know if that’s legal or not, but from the perspective of tax assessing, if everyone did that, nobody would be able to assess any property,” Mattison said. “The whole reason all those records are public is because someone felt the sale price should be public. There should be that paper trail.”
According to the Boston Assessing Department, the 29,700 square foot building and the land it sits on is valued at a total of $1,714,500.
But Mattison said he was more concerned with Harvard’s ongoing purchases in Allston than with the means of the transfers.
“The real concern is not so much this straw company merger as [Harvard’s] warehousing of all this property,” Mattison said. “A lot of it just sits empty and vacant in the middle of a neighborhood.”
He added that Harvard’s 2007 purchase of the Citgo station in Barry’s Corner, which is now an “empty, abandoned gas station,” was a “monument to Harvard’s damaging real estate practices.”
In the face of historic declines in Harvard’s endowment, “to see real estate acquisition continuing is quite a development,” Mattison added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In wasn’t until March 2006 that 49-year-old John Doe No. 4 was able to recall the dark memories of psychotherapy sessions as a prepubescent teenager.
The unnamed plaintiff filed a lawsuit that July against the doctor who had treated him almost 40 years ago, alleging that the defendant sexually abused at least six patients over a period of more than 17 years. That doctor was Melvin D. Levine, a former Harvard Medical School professor who served as chief of ambulatory pediatrics for 14 years at Harvard-affiliated Children’s Hospital, which is accused in the suit of negligence.
John Doe No. 4 received word today that the hospital’s motion to dismiss the negligence claims on the grounds of “charitable immunity”—a legal doctrine currently recognized in only three states limiting liability in civil suits against charities—was denied.
The plaintiff’s lawyer, Carmen L. Durso, hailed the Mass. Superior Court decision as a significant victory for not only John Doe No. 4 but also other victims of sexual abuse.
“The judge recognized the problem of applying charitable immunity to sexual abuse cases,” Durso said. “That, I think, is the significant thing—[charitable immunity] doesn’t belong in those cases.”
Had the motion been approved, Children’s would have gotten off on a “legal technicality,” Durso said.
Durso said he expects more motions to prevent the trial by jury demanded by both plaintiffs, John Does No. 3 and 4. Durso added that depositions will be taken sometime in the next six months.
Children’s Hospital’s attorney, William J. Dailey, Jr. of the Boston law firm Sloane and Walsh, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Yesterday’s decision was the first ruling on charitable immunity in favor of the plaintiff that Durso, whose practice focuses on victims of sexual abuse and medical malpractice, said he has seen in recent years.
Charitable immunity, which has been struck down or limited in almost every state, holds that funds contributed to an organization performing charitable work should not be diverted to pay for claims against the charity. Massachusetts law currently caps such damages against nonprofit entities at $20,000.
Though the Massachusetts Hospital Association has previously expressed strong support of the charitable immunity cap, a spokesperson for the organization told the Globe in January 2006 that it would not oppose a bill to lift the charitable immunity exemption for sexual abuse claims against charities, as the bill was aligned with the hospitals’ mission.
“It’s enormously unfair and unrealistic in this day and age,” Durso said of the doctrine, explaining that people “can be harmed by a charity just as they can be harmed by anybody else.”
The lawsuit—which accuses Levine of sexual abuse, including “numerous acts of genital fondling, masturbation, and other attempted and threatened acts of assault”—is one of five pending cases of child abuse allegations recently filed against the former Medical School professor in court, Durso said.
Levine, who left the Medical School in 1985 to serve as the director of a clinical center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, has vehemently and publicly denied ever sexually touching a patient.
But similar allegations of Levine’s misconduct had been brought to the state’s attention over 10 years ago.
In September of 1993, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine received a complaint for unprofessional conduct, sexual misconduct, and patient abuse from another of Levine’s former patients.
In April of last year, Levine voluntarily suspended his medical license in North Carolina, where he has been seeing patients at Chapel Hill for over 20 years, and is under investigation by the state medical board.
And in late November, Levine resigned from All Kinds of Minds, the North Carolina institute he founded in 1995 to train teachers to help children with learning disabilities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—Last season, Harvard posted an abysmal 8-22 record.
If this season’s eighth win is any indication, the Tommy Amaker era has finally begun for the Harvard Crimson.
Last night, Harvard (8-6) stormed into Conte Forum and grabbed a stunning 82-70 victory over No. 17 Boston College in front of 3,174 shocked fans, just three days after the Eagles had upset then-No. 1 North Carolina 85-78.  
Led by yet another terrific performance by junior guard Jeremy Lin, who posted a game-high 27 points, Harvard was able to notch its first ever win over a ranked opponent, ending Boston College’s 10-game winning streak in the process. It was also its first win over the Eagles (13-3, 1-0 ACC) since a 62-61 victory on Nov. 18, 1998.
“I can’t give enough credit to Jeremy and the rest of our kids for the effort they put forth,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Defensively, we were tremendous. We were very scrappy. That’s the calling card for our team.”
Harvard jumped on Boston College from the outset, taking a 33-27 lead into halftime over a sluggish Eagles’ squad. And just 12 seconds into the second frame, the Crimson proved it would not back down.
With BC All-American guard Tyrese Rice running the offense, Lin stripped him of the ball and broke away for a layup. Senior guard Drew Housman faked and blew by Rice for another layup on the next possession. After a bucket from captain Andrew Pusar and a defensive stop on the other end, Lin drilled a three to cap the Crimson’s quick 9-4 run to go up 42-31. Aided by the loud crowd behind it, BC responded in force, and trailed just 49-43 with 11:42 left. But that was as close as the Eagles would get, as Lin answered with a long three in front of Raji, kick-starting a 17-7 run.
Harvard shot the lights out in the second frame, making 14-of-23 field goals. BC never saw it coming, especially after such a solid defensive effort against North Carolina.
“In the second half, we didn’t defend them at all,” Eagles’ coach Al Skinner said. “They shot 60 percent. We just didn’t get ourselves ready to play the way we should have.”
The group that paced this dominating performance late was made up of Lin, Miller, Pusar, freshman Peter Boehm, and classmate Oliver McNally. All five stayed on from the 9:40 mark until the game became a free throw shooting contest in the final minute. For most, it was their standout game of the season.
McNally had a career-high 17 points, Miller grabbed a career-best nine boards against taller BC post players, and Pusar had a season-high 13 points. Boehm shook off earlier struggles to nail a huge three at the 9:05 mark a fraction of a second before the shot clock expired.
“We have a lot of capable offensive threats,” Lin said. “Doug [Miller] played very well down low, and Oliver [McNally], as a freshman, came in and hit big shots.”
Lin quite possibly had the game of his career. The junior posted an unreal stat line, shooting 11-of-16 from the floor, dishing out eight assists against two turnovers, and adding six steals to flabbergast the Eagle ballhanders. Defensively, he went head-to-head with an All-American guard, Rice, who had just torched UNC for 25 points in the previous game.  Rice, BC’s leading scorer entering the contest, had just three points until there was 4:02 remaining in the game.  He finished with 14 points.
BC did make things close again in the final minutes, cutting the deficit to seven at 70-63 after Rice made three free throws with 49 ticks left. But the Crimson players kept their nerves as Lin and McNally nailed all their free throws in one-and-one situations near game’s end, with the freshman doing that feat twice. 
“They controlled the game, controlled the tempo, did the things they had to do,” Skinner said. “We had our opportunities, we just didn’t sustain them. We just thought seems would eventually turn our way, we did not go out and earn it, whereas Harvard, particularly in the second half, came out and earned everything it got.”
For most of the first half, a Crimson win seemed unlikely. Slow starts on offense by both teams saw Harvard down 17-11 with 9:23 left in the half. Pusar then nailed a three, and the next time down the floor, McNally drove, pump-faked, and was fouled as his layup dropped in. After his free throw, Harvard never trailed again.
After Lin found Pusar for a fast-break layup, Miller took charge on the other end,  emphatically swatting guard Reggie Jackson’s layup attempt off the backboard, leading to a fast-break hoop for Lin and an Eagles time out.
Unfortunately for the BC coach, that break did little to stall the momentum, as by the end of the half, the Eagles had 10 turnovers to seven for their guests and their Wooden Award candidate Rice was scoreless.
“They played hard, we did not,” Skinner said.
Did they ever.—Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s basketball team (8-6) will look to set the tone for the new year as it faces perennial Ivy League rival Dartmouth (3-9) in its league opener at home tomorrow afternoon.The Big Green ended any hopes of a Crimson postseason run last year, handing the team a season-ending 68-62 loss in a playoff to determine the league’s automatic NCAA bid. A win by Harvard this time around would build momentum for a team striving for its third straight Ivy title.But it won’t be easy.While Dartmouth’s non-conference record may not accurately reflect its capability on the court, looks can be deceiving.“We don’t look at non-conference records; they’re almost meaningless,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They played a really strong non-conference schedule, and I’m sure they’re feeling prepared for Ivies.”“It doesn’t matter what our records are,” co-captain Niki Finelli said. “Every time we play Dartmouth, it’s always 40 minutes of hard basketball.”The Crimson finished off its non-conference schedule with a thrilling 78-72 victory in overtime against Northeastern on Dec. 31. Four players finished in double figures, including Finelli with a game-high 18 points. The team had a hot-shooting hand, draining 50 percent of its shots from behind the arc.Even with reading period in full swing and final exams looming, many of the players on the team feel no lack of motivation for such an important game.“We really don’t have time during reading period besides playing basketball and doing work,” Finelli said. “It’s tough, because you really have to stay focused. It’s a stressful period, but I think the fact that this is such a big game to start [conference play], our adrenaline gets so high because the game means so much for ourselves and this program.”Similarly, Delaney-Smith believes that reading period won’t have a detrimental effect on her players.“It’s easier to put in practices with reading period,” Delaney-Smith said. “In my estimation, it is valuable time spent on tweaking things and making adjustments. We’re not going to be rusty. Besides, when aren’t class conflicts, papers, and review sessions ever a factor?”Harvard will definitely have its hands full as it matches up against an agile but physical opponent in Dartmouth. The Big Green’s leading scorers are senior guard Koren Schram and sophomore forward Brittney Smith, who have 12.8 and 12.4 points per game respectively. Together, the two standout players forge a strong offensive attack that can be extremely lethal from behind the arc. The Crimson must find a way to stop Schram, who has taken 90 three-point attempts so far this season and connected on 34 percent of them.“[Dartmouth] runs one of the best motion offenses in the country,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re very athletic and very good at moving and connecting with each other.”While Dartmouth relies on outside shooting and a fluid motion offense, Harvard will look to capitalize on the strength of its inside game, averaging almost 40 rebounds a contest. To do this, however, the Crimson must be able to move the ball up the court, striking a balance between the fast-break game and penetration in the lane. Should the team be successful in doing that, look for sophomore forward Emma Markley and co-captain guard Emily Tay to take care of the scoring. The two players lead the team with 14.1 and 10.4 points per game respectively.“We’ve been working a lot on the defensive end. We need to make sure we play collective team defense, pushing the ball and working on our transition game, so we can get some fast-break points and really play our game,” Finelli said.Though tomorrow’s game may not have any foreseeable implications just yet, the stakes have never been higher for a season opener.“Dartmouth is our biggest rival in the league,” Finelli said. “We have to come out aggressively and outwork them on the floor if we want a shot at victory.”Coach Delaney-Smith put it best.“We’ve battled each other for titles for so many of the past years,” she said. “I’m pretty sure they’re the same Dartmouth team as they’ve been the last twenty years.” —Staff writer Kevin T.

In his junior season, guard Jeremy Lin has had some fine games so far. There was his career-high 30-point, nine-rebound game against Holy Cross. 26 points on 9-of-12 shooting at Colgate. 17 points and nine assists against just one turnover at home versus Santa Clara.But none of those came against a team that had just beaten the best team in the land, playing against one of the best guards in the country—a reigning First Team All-Conference performer in one of the nation’s toughest leagues.Until now. At No. 17 Boston College, Lin bested Eagles guard Tyrese Rice and every other defender as he put up 27 points on 11-of-16 shooting, eight assists, and six steals while only turning the ball over twice in a stunning 82-70 victory. It was quite an improvement from the last time his team battled a ranked opponent. In last year’s opener against No. 23 Stanford, he had no points, turnovers, or assists, but did pick up five fouls in a 111-56 loss.Showing the vast improvement he has made, Lin made plays all over the court, scoring and creating for his teammates, leading the undersized Harvard effort at the defensive end, and leaving a strong impression on his opponent.“He got his rhythm going and spread the floor well,” Eagles coach Al Skinner said. “We didn’t do a good job of staying in front of him. He’s very capable of getting his shoulder around our guys and getting penetration to the basket. When we did help, he was able to get rid of it and deliver the ball. In the second half, he just dominated the game for them, taking care of the offense.”That domination started on the opening possession after halftime, when he stole the ball from Rice and coasted for a layup. The second-half highlight show began there, as he went on to score 19 points in that frame. Lin nailed a three in the corner after some great ball movement to make it 42-31 just over three minutes into the second half. He stole the ball and nearly dunked on BC shooting guard Rakim Saunders, drawing the foul instead. He hit a fade-away jumper over Saunders after a Harvard timeout to put his team up 45-36. The three he nailed to give the Crimson a 52-43 lead with 11:29 to go came from several feet beyond the arc.As BC moved to close him down, Lin’s teammates got more and more open. And Lin found them—half of his assists came after the break. Up just 52-45 halfway through the last frame, he led a fast break that found freshman forward Peter Boehm for an easy layup. Then, with the shot clock winding down and seemingly nothing available, he found Boehm open again for a three-pointer. With under eight minutes to go, he led the Harvard transition again and found freshman guard Oliver McNally for an open three in the corner and a 62-48 lead.His highlight-reel assist came several possessions later when he faked a three at the top of the key and instead dished to junior forward Doug Miller for a wide-open layup.“This team has a lot of weapons,” Lin said. “I just need to throw it out to any of the shooters. We were able to spread the floor, and defenders had to respect our shooters, so it creates open opportunities.”As opportunities opened for Lin to score, he took advantage of them. Twice in the final quarter of the game he blew by opponents for layups, and then when the Eagles cut it to 10 at 66-56 with three minutes left, he went around Rice and nailed a jumper, giving his team more distance.His first half was no slouch either, as he pulled Harvard’s strings and had eight points with four assists—the last one on a pass to captain guard Andrew Pusar with seven seconds left to give his team all the momentum going into the break.“Making the right decision, the right play, we need it in his hands,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “We trust him and he delivers.”He delivered on defense as well, as in the first half he held Rice—who scored 25 points Sunday at North Carolina—to a goose egg while grabbing three steals, all off Sanders.“This young man has been tremendous for us in every category,” Amaker said.He means that quite literally, as Lin is the only player in the nation to rank in the top ten in his conference in scoring, rebounding, assists, steals, blocks, field goal shooting, free throw shooting, and three-point shooting percentage.The only downside of his night was that, thanks to picking up several unnecessary fouls around the midway mark of the game, he fouled out with 40 seconds to play. But it proved to be a fitting end to a great night. Instead of the silly chants given at most games when a visitor fouls out, Lin was greeted with nothing but applause.—Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

Yale introduced Jacksonville Jaguars assistant Tom Williams as its new head coach on Wednesday, and Williams wasted no time declaring “We’re going to beat Harvard. We’ve got to turn The Game back into a rivalry.”Williams played linebacker at Stanford, earning a Rhodes Scholar nomination his senior year. He captained the Cardinal to a share of the 1992 Pacific-10 Conference title.Williams began his coaching career as a graduate assistant under Bill Walsh at Stanford. He then moved to Hawaii, where he coached for three seasons, then moved to work under Rick Neuheisel at Washington for three years. In 2002, just one year before Neuheisel was axed after numerous recruiting violations and gambling on the NCAA tournament, Williams returned to his alma mater as defensive coordinator. In 2005, he worked under former Texas coach Dick Tomey at San Jose State as the defensive coordinator. The next year, he moved to the Jaguars, where he has served as a defensive assistant under head coach Jack Del Rio.Williams steps into the shoes of Jack Siedlecki, who had lost seven of his last eight against Harvard, including an embarrassing 37-6 drubbing in 2007 that ruined an undefeated season for the Elis. Siedlecki finished 70-49 in 12 seasons at Yale, winning Ivy championships in 1999 and 2006.—CRIMSON SPORTS STAFF
