After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past decade Israel has emerged as a one of the world’s leading technological giants. Remarkably, despite its small size, Israel ranksranks first in the world in venture capital investments as a percentage of GDP and first in R&D investment. It is home to 10 Nobel Prize laureates and a pioneer in industries ranging from biotechnology to financial engineering. Bill Gates described Israel as the “country (relative to its population) that has done the most to contribute to the technology revolution” and Warren Buffet vouched for Israel’s “brains, energy, and integrity.”
Dan Senor and Saul Singer first brought to light the uniqueness of Israel’s start-up economy in their 2009 bestseller “Start-up Nation.” More recently Google’s acquisition of Israeli start-up company, Waze, for more than a billion dollars has furthered this fascination. Many foreign companies have been pouring money into Israel while trying to understand how Israel has been so successful in creating an atmosphere conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation. Even many foreign governments, such as South Korea, have been trying to understand Israeli culture in an attempt to attract jobs in high-paying, hi-tech industries.
This summer, five other Harvard students and I along with 35 students from other American universities participated in the TAMID Fellowship, which aims to connect Israeli and American businesses by sending Americans to Israel to intern at Israeli companies. I wanted to work at a start-up company as opposed to an established American company with offices in Israel, to experience the Israeli start-up culture first hand. I wound up at a small Tel Aviv financial services company called “I Know First” with fewer than 10 employees. I Know First uses an algorithm to predict movements in the stock, currency, and commodities markets.
When I first started, I expected to be tasked with writing insignificant internal memos and creating PowerPoints. I never expected anyone would pay much attention to my suggestions and advice. However, on the first day, the CEO, Yaron Golgher, sat down with me and explained his short-term goals for the company. He had me analyze the data and published my conclusions on the company’s main website that very day. When I came to work the following day I suggested a few ways to improve the user interface of the I Know First website. Not only did the CEO listen to my suggestions, he also told me that if I were interested I could have complete freedom to redesign the company’s LinkedIn page as well as an entirely new ancillary company website. Later that week I was asked to write a press release about the company and Yaron sent the article to be published under the company’s name to Seeking Alpha, a financial website.
Many people attribute Israel’s success to its world-class engineering schools, the military experience of its workforce, and its habitually challenging geopolitical climate, but I believe it is the Israeli openness to criticism and new ideas, respect for initiative-takers, and its culture of helping others that are the more important factors to consider. Yaron encouraged me to challenge the existing image of the company, listened to my ideas that were unrelated to my original task, and encouraged me to reach out to my friends at venture capital firms to drum up interest and connections.
The neighborhood where I worked, the Tel Aviv Port, is a hub of start-up companies and budding entrepreneurs. The main office of Wix, the hyped-up website builder, is less than a block away. Every restaurant in the area is teeming with entrepreneurs touting their products and handing out contact information. When I went out to lunch with my colleagues and other Israeli entrepreneurs in the area, everyone at the table was well informed about the latest start-up companies and had an overall sense of national pride. It was apparent that so many Israelis saw the success of Waze as a national success, not just as a victory for one Silicon Wadi company. It seems to me that Israel’s constant struggles and concurrent need for purpose and meaning drives people to work together, transfer ideas, and connect each other to those who can further help their companies.
In the two months I worked in Tel Aviv, I learned that regardless of which factors are most influential in contributing to Israel’s rapid technological growth, an openness to new ideas and a sense of national pride would be of help to any country. Perhaps America can adopt some of Israel’s receptivity and helpfulness. Maybe our corporate culture should at times abandon its hierarchical structure and impractical competition to create a more accessible and cooperative workplace where new ideas can be freely suggested and workers can feel they have a meaningful voice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After indefinitely halting ongoing construction in North Allston four years ago, Harvard seems to be making tentative moves forward with development plans for 1.4 million square feet of its property in Allston. Most recently, Harvard submitted a revised Institutional Master Plan for review to the Boston Redevelopment Authority including ambitious plans for the construction of a hotel, conference center, and new basketball stadium as well as renovations to the Stadium and graduate student housing. At the same time, Harvard presented a possible framework for a $13-15 million community benefits package to go along with the 10-year plan for development. This community benefits package, which is required to appear in some form in the final plan, is an exciting opportunity, but requires caution: Harvard and community members need to be thoughtful to ensure that the package really does sustainable good for the community.
In the past, Harvard’s attempts at development in Allston have, understandably, met with strong resistance from Allston and Brighton community members.  While the University often proclaims that its development in Allston will benefit the Allston community, its actions have suggested that that has not always been its primary goal.
For example, when Harvard announced that it would build its Innovation Lab on Western Avenue in North Allston, it described that part of the iLab’s resources would be set aside for the use of local small businesses and nonprofits and that the i-Lab would include a coffee shop open to neighborhood residents. However, as we predicted two years ago, in practice, the i-Lab is far from useful to most Allston residents; the space caters almost exclusively to Harvard affiliates.
In another example, in 2007, Harvard included plans for a 3-acre park near 28 Travis Street as part of its Institutional Master Plan. Last year, though, Harvard proposed to build a shuttle facility, police training site, recycling center, and other facilities in the same space. Allston residents protested the negative impact of this development on the commercial and residential community nearby, but the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved most of the proposal this spring and Harvard went forward with its new plan.
We ask Harvard to truly consider the effects of its development on the Allston community and work to follow the intent, not just the letter, of its obligation to the Allston community.  In the past, Harvard’s attempts at providing community benefits have included the Harvard-Allston Education Portal and the construction of a mini-golf course for the use of Allston community members. While education and entertainment are important, residents dealing with business closures, construction sites, and a rapidly changing neighborhood demographics deserve benefits related to housing, employment, and transportation. All decision-makers involved should listen carefully to the recommendations of the Harvard-Allston Task Force to ascertain which benefits will actually help the residents, small business owners, and workers of Allston in both the short term and long term.
Harvard’s track record with community-oriented development is not great. We are happy to see movement forward on construction in Allston and excited about the prospects afforded by the possible $13-15 million community benefits package. However, it would be a shame if Harvard simply used these millions to construct resources that were useful only to Harvard affiliates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first saw "Frasier,” I couldn’t help but think the show had a strange premise. Why would a middle-aged man seeking to make a “fresh start” move to a city where his brother and father already live?
After watching the show more, I realized I was unnerved only because the current trend in media is to portray life as an exercise in separation. These days, television directors enjoy illustrating divisions between “work” and “life,” not only between the professional and the personal, but also within personal life.
Family has become a burden in the world of televised comedy. Popular contemporary comedies, such as “Big Bang Theory,” “New Girl,” and “Girls,” tend to have a myopic focus on friendship, to the exclusion of professional and familial life—this allows them to validate the prevailing belief that taking on meaningful responsibilities threatens to destroy the possibility of “having a life.” “Frasier” counters the popular narrative of a “separated” life, in which the household and workplace are holding us back, and replaces it with a convincing argument that embracing and understanding personal history is key to moving forward.
Instead of giving in to artificial divisions, “Frasier” focuses on the nuances of how different areas of life overlap. By being meticulous in depicting how familial and professional issues pervade every aspect of the characters’ lives, the show gives us characters more well-drawn than those found in almost any other sitcom.
A minute focus on domestic life is the source of much of the show’s wit and charm. Much of the first season revolves around Frasier and his father, Martin, having impassioned arguments about the aesthetic incompatibility of an armchair with the rest of the living room décor. For Martin, the armchair is all he has left of his marriage and police career. For Frasier, it is little more than a kitschy intruder into his carefully curated Afro-Bauhaus furniture collection.
Being a man who spends his days listening to the troubles of people in need, the radio psychiatrist has surprisingly little patience for his father’s simple habits and colloquialisms.  The armchair is the tiny beginning of a long chain of household annoyances. Frasier’s fastidious younger brother, Niles, is both embarrassed by and jealous of Frasier’s “fast food” approach to psychiatry. Niles, in turn, is a regular source of pain to his wife, Maris—an unseen character whose obvious displeasure with their marriage is only visible in Niles’ strewn hair and flushed face whenever he walks through the door.
All these intimate frustrations are mocked by the presence of Daphne Moon, a complete outsider to the Crane family. As a “live-in healthcare worker” for Martin, her loopy accent and sporadic anecdotes about a truly dysfunctional family serve to illuminate the breathtaking insularity of Crane squabbles.
The first episode of “Frasier” aired twenty years ago, and few shows since have been able to capture family life with the same level of insight. NBC’s “Chuck” accomplished something similar using the time-honored espionage narrative as a way to disrupt illusions about work-life separation. But in the process, it substituted Californian campiness for a Seattleite’s subtlety.
In acknowledging that understanding family is a lifelong endeavor, “Frasier” spends much time painstakingly deconstructing complex relationships into the simplest of interactions. The viewer gets to enjoy the intellectually satisfying and highly entertaining task of putting the pieces back together.
In the first season finale, we learn that it has been a year since Frasier moved to Seattle. At Café Nervosa, Niles innocently poses the question “Are you happy?” and Frasier cheekily responds by asking Niles if he really loves his wife, gleefully needling him about marrying Maris for money.
As Niles’ question remains unanswered, Frasier’s anxiety and obsessiveness is paraded before us: he repeatedly sends back his coffee, perturbed by specks of cinnamon, and makes wisecracks about living with his father.
Finally, Martin shows up, distraught over both of his sons forgetting his birthday. In wake of this revelation, Niles and Frasier are mortified at their shallow conversation and decide to take their father out to dinner at a restaurant of his choice. The episode ends with Frasier sitting alone in the café, the waitress walking up to him with his nth cup of coffee, asking “Are you happy now?”
We are relieved to hear Frasier finally admit he is, actually, happy. It brings out into the open a truth we rarely acknowledge. Despite all the annoyances we have with others in our own lives, we are not crazy to believe that the continual process of breaking down and building up relationships in our lives is enough to make us content.
By season five, the eyes of the entire Crane household twinkle with suppressed laughter when a houseguest expresses surprise at seeing Marty’s armchair in the fashionable apartment. Over the course of 11 seasons, coping becomes understanding, and understanding becomes love.
Perhaps some television shows choose to compartmentalize or ignore familial interactions because such experiences are intensely personal and dissimilar. But “Frasier” doesn’t attempt to generalize. Rather, the show gives us a truly outlandish family—so outlandish it is immediately recognizable.
All we have to do (like the hero of the show, when he’s at his best) is sit back, listen, and discover that— family or not—the most realistic depictions are born when a multitude of eccentricities are thrown together.

Bashar al-Assad has gassed his own people, and the United States is probably going to remove him from power. President Obama wants to consult Congress before we breach the fray, and he’s done us all a favor, giving the American people a week to talk things and me time to write things out.
Over the past few decades, two complicated webs of alliances have been woven, pitting moderate, American-backed Arab regimes—the Jordanian and Saudi Arabian monarchies and the restorationist Egyptian military junta—against anti-Western, Islamist state and non-state actors—Iran, the Assad regime, Hezbollah, and the Muslim Brotherhood. Both coalitions are fractious, the first beset by personal animosities and border disputes, the second by religious difference. Yet, they hold together on the basis of common goals. The only imperative of the Hashemites, the House of Saud, and the Egyptian generals, all which face persistent, systemic challenges to their rule, is self-preservation, a goal served by American largesse and accommodation with Israel. The Islamic Republic and its clients, notionally at least, depend on popular support for revolutionary ideologies that combine religion, socialism, and anti-colonialism in a number of permutations and are inherently antagonistic toward the West and the Jewish state.
We see in the Syrian conflict a showdown between these two forces, one that will determine the future of the region. Syria is the link in the chain of Iran’s foreign policy, critical in any attempt the mullahs might make to project power beyond their borders. Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant group active in southern Lebanon, is funded by Iran. That assistance has been a means by which the Islamic Republic has stuck its finger in the eye of Israel, its more formidable opponent. Indeed, Hezbollah, thanks to the good offices of the Iranians, has developed a nigh-ineradicable terrorist operation on the Jewish state’s northern frontier, leaving normal life to the mercy of geopolitical vicissitudes.
Iranian materiel wends its way to southern Lebanon through Syria, and the Islamic Republic will not stand by idly as a new regime hostile to its interests emerges. Why should it? Britain and France almost went to war in Africa as both pursued the geographical continuity and hegemony on the continent that only one empire could possess. Iran has destabilized post-Saddam Hussein Iraq for the sake its own prestige. It will attempt to do the same in Syria, during the initial stages of an American intervention and after a new regime coalesces in Damascus.
The Iranian malefactors could take a couple of tacks. They might, as they did in Iraq, play on religious tensions and bankroll a bloody insurgency, plunging Syria once again into civil war. The conflict could also turn hot, and there are early indications that it may very well do so depending the scope and aims of the Syrian mission. Yes, full-out war, a fête complete with sarin gas party favors, is a real possibility.
We could be entering a torturous, exorbitant, and deadly struggle. That doesn’t mean it does not hold out hope of a future worth fighting for. The removal of Assad and his replacement by a pliable, sovereign regime means a far more hospitable Middle East. It means the diminishment of Hezbollah’s military capacity, and curbs on its deleterious participation in Lebanese politics. It means a weakened Iran, and perhaps one chastened to the point of a measured attitude on nuclear weapons. It means the bolstering of American clients, and a greater ability for the U.S. to exert pressure on those regimes. It means a higher chance of Israeli-Palestinian and Israeli-Arab peace, as one intractable regime is toppled, a second freed from chicanery, and a third mollified.
Conceivable risks abound almost as greatly as rewards. Failure could mean unceasing attacks on Israel from Syria and Lebanon. It could mean empowering elements in Syria, like the al-Nusra front, which will become our foes down the line. Faced with an engagement gone awry, the U.S. might abandon the effort, pitching the region into an abyss it would take decades from which to emerge.
As a geopolitical thinker, a liberal universalist, and someone whose ancestors experienced the horrors of Zyklon B, I favor intervention. However, we must have a conversation about this first. “Words, words, words,” many neoconservatives say, desperate as they are to hit something, anything, everything. Let’s ignore them this time, lest we overlook oure more pernicious adversaries.

The number of confidential reports of rape at Harvard University almost doubled from  12 in 2011 to 23 in 2012, according to the annual crime report released by the Harvard University Police Department.
The report also highlighted a clear divide between the University’s Longwood and Cambridge campuses, with the Cambridge campus having over 10 times the number of crimes in the Longwood campus.
HUPD released its annual campus security report for the year 2012 this past Tuesday. The report, titled “Playing It Safe,” disclosed statistics about crimes on the University’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses.
The document highlighted that while crime in Longwood had remained low, both the number of confidentially reported rapes and burglaries have risen in Cambridge compared to 2011.
Confidential reports mean that the victim’s name, address, and any other identifying information are withheld. The number of formal rape reports remained one per year.
All of the 23 confidential reports for the year 2012 were cases of rape that happened on University property in Cambridge.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello said that the majority of rape cases in Cambridge involved acquaintances. In regards to the general city safety, Riviello wrote in an email that “the number of stranger‐to-stranger rapes each year [in Cambridge], between one and five, remains extremely low.”
The number of burglaries on the Cambridge campus also increased, from 24 total cases in 2011 to 34 total cases in 2012. Overall, the total number of criminal offenses for the Cambridge campus increased from 118 crimes reported in 2011 to 136 in 2012, with 72 of those offenses occurring on campus compared to 56 in 2011.
Despite this rise in overall offenses, the number of offenses remained well below the 158 events reported for the year 2010.
On Harvard’s Longwood campus, only 12 total criminal offenses were reported, a decrease from 17 offenses in 2011 and 18 in 2010.
Of the crimes that occurred on or around the Cambridge campus, burglary, aggravated assault, and rape were the three most common offenses. The number of aggravated assaults dropped this year from 36 in 2011 to 28 in 2012, with all but 2 occurring on public property. All burglaries and reports of rapes occurred on campus property.

While Allston and Brighton residents can now take the Harvard shuttle across the Charles River to Harvard Square for free, some residents have expressed concerns that the benefits of the shuttle service are negligible without an extension of existing shuttle routes.
Open access to shuttle services was announced to Allston residents last spring, according to University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall, but Harvard-Allston Task Force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said residents did not hear of changes until July. The shuttle’s current route in Allston cuts through Harvard Business School, but does not reach residential neighborhoods south of Western Avenue. Consequently, residents said that the shuttle does not effectively increase access to Harvard Square.
“The service being offered is… completely meaningless to the community,” Whelan said.
Harry E. Mattison, another member of the task force, echoed Whelan’s concerns.
“The shuttle doesn’t come anywhere near this neighborhood,” Mattison said.
Both task force members said that they believed Harvard’s efforts to benefit the Allston community have fallen short of residents’ expectations.
“Harvard’s interest is in generating a list of things that can be called community benefits that really cost nothing,” Whelan said.
Marshall wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that the extension of the shuttle service to include Allston and Brighton residents came “as a result of community interest over recent years.” The University’s intent, the statement continued, is to “benefit our neighbors in Allston who have worked closely with us in the transitions of functions to Travis Street,” where Harvard relocated many of its campus service facilities in March.
According to Whelan, community representatives first discussed the possibility of access to shuttle services in 2006.
Some Allston residents are less critical of the change. Reynold M. McKinney, an Allston resident whose father and brother attended Harvard, said he was pleased to learn of the shuttle service announcement.
“Having the Harvard shuttle is really going to be a benefit to the people,” he said. “I am astounded at how much Harvard is willing to do for the Allstonians. They’re willing to give them anything.”
Harvard filed its Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston—which proposed nine construction projects including a new basketball arena and the Allston Science Complex—in July. Increased shuttle access represents one element of a community benefits package that has been debated all summer by the University and the task force. While the task force has not finalized the community benefits package, Whelan said that he expects Harvard to put forward a serious commitment to large changes.
Both Whelan and Mattison mentioned the importance of Harvard’s investment in the Gardner Pilot Academy, a pre-kindergarten through grade seven public school in Allston, as one of these commitments. Whelan also suggested the refurbishment of Smith Field, which lies west of Barry’s Corner, and the creation of an access road that would allow Harvard’s construction trucks to bypass public roads. He estimated that each project would cost $3 million or more, but said that in every case, the investment would be transformational in a way current community benefit offerings have not been.
“This current plan… is so shrunken that it is about nothing except what Harvard needs in the next 10 years,” Whelan said.

After failing to reach an agreement by an August deadline on health care and the union eligibility of certain jobs, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and the University have begun the process of selecting third parties to help resolve ongoing disagreements. These issues had remained unsettled after the ratification of their most recent contract in April.
HUCTW, which represents over 4,600 of Harvard’s non-faculty staff, and the University have been mired in negotiations almost continuously since July 1, 2012, when the old contract between both parties expired. After the longest round of contract negotiations in the union’s history, both sides came to an agreement and ratified a new contract on April 2 of this year.
But the contract left concerns regarding health care and union eligibility unresolved. According to a press release issued by HUCTW at the time, these issues were referred to newly created negotiating units made up of representatives from the union and the University.
These groups, called the Health Care Group and the Joint Committee on the Bargaining Unit, were tasked with reaching an agreement in a three-month window that ended in August.
These issues will now be referred to third party mediators and arbitrators in the coming weeks, as required by the contract.
According to Tania M. deLuzuriaga, a University spokesperson, Harvard and HUCTW are in the “early stages” of selecting those third parties.
“It is a shared goal of the University and HUCTW that these discussions yield agreements that benefit members of the HUCTW and the campus as a whole,” deLuzuriaga wrote in an email.
According to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger, lingering concerns regarding health care include Medex, a healthcare plan for HUCTW retirees meant to supplement Medicare. Jaeger said that many retirees have experienced increased co-payments in the past year and a half. Over the summer the bargaining unit group attempted to address issues regarding which types of Harvard employees are eligible to join HUCTW.
“There’s more and more awareness in the Harvard workforce that it matters and makes a difference whether you’re in the union or not,” Jaeger said. “We’re in regular contact with a lot of staff members that are not in our bargaining unit who can’t understand why they’re not and for some of those people it’s intensely important.”
Jaeger added that he wished these issues could have been resolved during the summer’s negotiations, independently of any third party.
“The best, clearest, and most strongly supported frameworks are usually the ones that are arrived at just by the parties voluntarily, with hard work but without any external persuasion,” Jaeger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part II of a four-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2017, based on data collected by The Crimson in an online survey conducted in the month of August. Part I ran on Tuesday, Part II ran on Wednesday, and Part IV will run on Friday.
After going public a year ago with their investigation into Harvard’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory, administrators went to great lengths to promote a culture of academic integrity in the Harvard community.
But the results of a Crimson survey of the Class of 2017 conducted last month suggest that some of the newest members of that community are already guilty of academic dishonesty.
Ten percent of respondents admitted to having cheated on an exam, and 17 percent said they had cheated on a paper or a take-home assignment. An even greater percentage—42 percent—admitted to cheating on a homework assignment or problem set.
Recruited athletes were even more likely to admit to cheating—20 percent admitted to cheating on an exam, compared to 9 percent of students who were not recruited to play a varsity sport at Harvard. Twenty-six percent of recruited athletes said they had cheated on a paper or take-home assignment, compared to 16 percent of non-recruits.
Across the board, the incoming freshman class reported higher rates of cheating  than did Harvard’s Class of 2013 in a Crimson senior survey conducted last spring. In that survey, 7 percent of graduating seniors said they had cheated on an exam, and 7 percent said they had cheated on a paper or take-home test. Thirty-two percent of graduating seniors said they cheated on a problem set or homework assignment during their undergraduate careers.
The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2017 generated responses from more 1,300 incoming freshmen—nearly 80 percent of the class. Part III of a four-part series on the results of the survey focuses on the academic and extracurricular lives of freshmen.
ACADEMICS
Recruited athletes were not the only demographic to be more likely to cheat. Men were more likely than women to report having cheated. Male freshmen were twice as likely as their female counterparts to have cheated on an exam and one-and-a-half times more likely to admit to cheating on a paper or take-home assignment.
Despite the number of freshmen who admitted to academic dishonesty, their responses indicate that they overwhelmingly expect to prioritize academics at Harvard. Eighty-four percent of respondents put academics first when asked to rank their anticipated priorities among academics, extracurriculars, varsity sports, paid employment, and social life. Not a single respondent put academics at the bottom of their list.
The academic interests of the new freshman class were not always consistent with concentration numbers at the College. Twenty-six percent of surveyed freshmen said they plan to concentrate in economics or government, the two most populous concentrations at Harvard that represent 21 percent of current Harvard concentrators. And not a single freshman expressed plans to study African and African American Studies, Germanic Languages and Literatures, or South Asian Studies.
And just three months after a faculty committee released a set of reports advocating the revitalization of the study of the arts and humanities at Harvard, just 11 percent of surveyed freshmen said they plan to concentrate in that discipline. That figure is even lower than the current percentage of arts and humanities concentrators, who already make up just 16 percent of the student body.
Surveyed freshmen were also ambitious in their undergraduate academic plans. Fifty-nine percent said they plan to pursue a secondary field, and 36 percent a language citation. Among all surveyed freshmen, 23 percent plan to pursue both.
The survey results suggest that these high achievers are self-motivated. Eighty-two percent identified their greatest source of pressure as their own expectations. Just 8 percent named their parents as their greatest source of pressure. But not everyone was stressed out—7 percent of respondents said they are not under pressure.
The majority of surveyed freshmen said they expect to spend more time studying in college than they did in high school. A plurality of respondents—36 percent—indicated that they anticipate studying between 20 and 29 hours a week in college, and 26 percent said they anticipate spending between 30 and 39. Four percent said they anticipate studying 50 or more hours a week, and only 2 percent said they anticipate studying for 10 or fewer.
In comparison, 58 percent said that they studied for 19 or fewer hours in high school. However, pre-college study habits varied widely between respondents who went to public and private secondary schools. Only 17 percent of students who attended a non-denominational private school said they studied for 10 or fewer hours a week, compared to 39 percent of public, non-charter school students.
EXTRACURRICULARS
Although a large majority of respondents ranked academics as their anticipated highest priority for college, a plurality—40 percent—ranked extracurriculars second, and another 35 percent ranked it third.
Surveyed freshmen were also enthusiastic about their secondary school extracurriculars. A large majority—84 percent—were involved in community service in high school. Also popular were music clubs/bands and student government, at 39 and 37 percent, respectively.
Respondents also reported being drawn to academic clubs in high school: 34 percent were involved in math clubs or competitions, 32 percent in science clubs or competitions, and 25 percent in other academic clubs.
Of those who were involved in student government in high school, 79 percent said they believe that student government has the power to effect change. Respondents who did not participate in student government were a bit more skeptical, with 60 percent expressing faith in the potential of student government.
Many surveyed freshmen rose to the top of their high school extracurriculars. A plurality of respondents—27 percent—were the president or top leader of two clubs in high school, and 26 percent were in charge of one. Two percent were the leaders of six or more clubs, and 9 percent were the editors-in-chief of their high school newspapers.
But not all freshmen obtained a top leadership role in their extracurriculars—19 percent led zero clubs.
ATHLETICS
One particularly popular high school extracurricular was athletics. Sixty-nine percent of surveyed freshmen reported being involved in athletics in high school, but just 12 percent of respondents were recruited to play a varsity sport at Harvard. An additional 9 percent of the class planned to walk on to a varsity team at Harvard.
Three quarters of  freshman athletes, including both walk-ons and recruits,  said they were likely or very likely to play their sport for all four years. However, recruited athletes were more likely than intended walk-on athletes to envision themselves graduating as four-year athletes, coming in at 93 and 47 percent, respectively.
Intended walk-on athletes were disproportionately drawn to certain sports. Among the intended walk-on athletes, more than 27 percent said they plan to try out for the men’s or women’s lightweight or heavyweight crew teams. Only three were ambitious enough to say they plan to walk on to the men’s basketball team that made it to March Madness the past two seasons.
Twenty-two percent of incoming recruited and walk-on athletes reported having received at least one concussion while playing a sport. Of those, two-thirds said they had been concussed once. But for most, these experiences did not dissuade them from playing their sports. Just 5 percent of all athletes and 19 percent of those who had been concussed from sports said they felt that concussions had affected their approach to their sport or desire to play that sport.
Athletes and non-athletes reported differing academic backgrounds. Coming into Harvard, 33 percent of incoming recruited athletes said that BC Calculus was the highest level of math they had completed prior to college, compared to 43 percent of non-athletes.
Athletes also expressed different academic plans for Harvard than their non-athlete counterparts. Although the “Gov Jock” is a commonly referenced stereotype among Harvard students, just one incoming recruited athlete expressed plans to concentrate in government. In comparison, 11 percent of non-athlete respondents were interested in becoming government concentrators.
On the other hand, economics, the most popular concentration among Harvard students, was disproportionately represented among incoming recruited athletes. Thirty-two percent said they expect to become economics concentrators, compared to 15 percent of non-athletes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Introductory courses have long been the backbone of many a Harvard student’s undergraduate experience. But while science concentrators enroll in Life Sciences 1a and economics concentrators opt to take Economics 10, students interested in the humanities have not had the same opportunity to take a broad introductory course.
Two new classes this semester, Humanities 11a: “Frameworks: The Art of Looking” and Humanities 11b: “Frameworks: The Art of Listening,” aim to fill that gap. Each one is interdisciplinary in nature and serves as a gateway for students interested in a humanities concentration.
The “frameworks” courses are a creation of the Harvard Humanities Project, an initiative spearheaded by the University’s humanities departments to revitalize student interest and increase collaboration across disciplines. A third course, Humanities 11c: “Frameworks: The Art of Reading,” will be offered for the first time this spring.
Comparative literature professor John T. Hamilton, who co-teaches “The Art of Listening” with music professor Alexander Rehding, explained that the new courses are aimed at freshmen and sophomores who are still trying to finalize their concentration plans, although juniors and seniors are also welcome.
“We’re trying to introduce students to the questions we ask and the work we do in the humanities,” Hamilton said. “This course is introductory on one hand, and on the other hand, universally applicable.”
According to English professor Louis Menand, students feel “comfortable” taking large introductory courses like LS1a or Ec10.
“Freshmen look at courses within the humanities department and don’t know where to start,” said Menand, who co-teaches English 110: “An Introductory Humanities Colloquium,” a class that has acted as an introductory course to the humanities for several years.
History of Art and Architecture professor Robin E. Kelsey, who co-teaches “The Art of Looking” with HAA professor Jennifer L. Roberts, said that he hopes the new frameworks courses will help to establish more of a community among humanities concentrators
“Other introductory courses [in the humanities] begin within a discipline. But with this class, we’re teaching humanistic ways of thinking that cut across these disciplinary boundaries,” Kelsey said.
Roberts described the new frameworks courses as a “massive undertaking” that has elicited genuine excitement among the faculty.
“It’s an exciting new way of organizing our own knowledge,” she said. “In a way, we’re learning things just like the students.”
Both courses have generated significant interest during shopping week. According to Kelsey, approximately 140 students attended the first lecture for “The Art of Looking,” while Hamilton said around 75 students attended the first lecture for “The Art of Listening”—three times the number he had expected.
Isaac C. Dayno ’15, a concentrator in History of Art and Architecture who shopped “The Art of Looking,” described the course’s multidisciplinary approach as “novel” and said he hopes to take the class if he places into it through the lottery.
Dayno added that he would have appreciated the opportunity to take these frameworks courses as a freshman or sophomore.
“As a freshman, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by all the different departments and trying to find your place,” he said. “These classes can give students an important skill set and allow them to engage with different disciplines across the humanities.”
“I think it’s a good idea for the college to be experimenting with these kinds of classes,” said Phillip C. Golub ’16, mentioning that freshmen struggling to find their place in the humanities might benefit from the “frameworks” courses.
Rehding said that the Humanities 11 courses are attempting a “pretty ambitious” feat.
“It’s important for students to understand that the humanities can answer big questions,” said Rehding. “There hasn’t been a forum where this kind of thing is possible. It’s an invitation to explore the humanities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Alumni Association student representatives revealed orange as the official color of the class of 2016 to an audience of more than 100 sophomores gathered at a welcome back ceremony in Memorial Church on Thursday.
The event, sponsored by HAA, also featured speeches by students and administrators, including Dean of the Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister.
Dingman encouraged the sophomores to use their freshman year as a “springboard” for sophomore year and beyond.
He also recognized the Class of 2016 for braving Hurricane Sandy, the February blizzard, and the events surrounding the Boston Marathon bombings.
“What stands out...was your goodwill, your tremendous volunteer spirit, and [your] lightening the load of dining hall workers and other Harvard staff,” Dingman said.
Dingman added that the Class of 2017 is “burdened trying to come after you,” noting the higher gender parity and number of foreign countries for the Class of 2016.
Speaking after Dingman, Pfister advised sophomores not to stress about their looming concentration declarations.
Following the two deans, the student representatives from the HAA unveiled a new banner for the Class of 2016.
The tradition of class colors began more than a hundred years ago when the upperclassman classes took up the colors of Dartmouth, Princeton, and Yale—green, orange, and blue, respectively—to promote class unity. At Commencement, rising sophomores would shed their freshman class color of crimson and receive the color of the graduating seniors.
The tradition disappeared after the 1960s, but was revived last year by students.
Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and UC Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14 closed out the ceremony with words of advice.
“I want you to know that even though you have a year under your belt, no one expects you to have all the answers yet,” Raghuveer said. “You should never stop asking questions.”
The UC, which helped organize the event with the HAA, scheduled other events to follow the ceremony, including a TED-talk-style ‘2016 Speaks’ event on Thursday night and food trucks and music during lunch on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New course enrollment data released by HarvardX last week ranked India as the country with the second most enrollment in the University’s new set of online courses, with the United States capturing a plurality of total registrants last year.
The United States led the pack with 223,302 enrollments, 43 percent of the total number of enrolled students for all HarvardX courses since its launch in the spring of 2012. India was next with 50,900 registrants, followed by Canada with 19,975.
Sergiy O. Nesterko, HarvardX research fellow and creator of an interactive visualization tool that displays relatively real-time course enrollment by country, speculated that India’s large population and relatively high degree of English proficiency may be possible explanations for its large HarvardX registration.
“To better understand this interactive visualization [world map of enrollment], you should keep the population of the country in mind,” said Nesterko. Brazil and Nigeria, the most populous countries in South America and Africa respectively, have the most HarvardX registrants on those two continents.
However, registrants from China, the most heavily populated country in the world, represent less than 2 percent of registrants for all HarvardX courses, with the exception of SW12x: “China,” whose development team has made concerted efforts to market the course through Chinese social networking sites, according to HarvardX spokesperson Michael P. Rutter.
Some members of the HarvardX team have already begun to utilize enrollment data to tailor educational experiences for online students.
“When we found out that the second-largest enrollment population after the U.S. was India, we actually started to think about how kitchens in India were organized,” said Pia M. Sörensen, the HarvardX Fellow for SPU 27x: “Science & Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science,” a virtual course in which students prepare recipes in their own homes.
“We found that a lot of kitchens in India don’t have ovens, which is a common staple for kitchens here,” said Sörensen. “We have two labs that require an oven, and because of that, we are tweaking both of those labs so that you can create something on a stovetop, microwave, or even a water bath.”
The newly-released data also broke down course enrollment numbers by academic discipline. While HarvardX features courses from engineering, social sciences, and the arts and humanities, the fields were not equally popular among last year’s virtual students.
The four least-registered open online classes all fell under the realm of humanities. As of Thursday, HDS1544.1x: “The Letters of the Apostle Paul,” AI12.1x: “Poetry in America: The Poetry of Early New England,” AI12.2x: “Poetry in America: Whitman,” and the Fall 2013 version of CB22.1x: “The Ancient Greek Hero” had 6915, 4073, 3728, and 1789 registrants, respectively.
These numbers may not be completely representative of actual enrollment rates, however.
Registration for a class does not necessarily reflect future participation. A significant proportion of registrants never interact or click on the course material, Nesterko said.

Attention sophomores thinking about concentrating in English: Stop reading op-eds. This summer, it seems like English—not to mention most disciplines in the humanities—have been denigrated and abused by columnists, cash-strapped universities, and graphs everywhere.
Despite the fervor over this certain oncoming apocalypse, level heads still exist: In a recent piece for The New Yorker, Adam Gopnik writes, "If we abolished English majors tomorrow, Stephen Greenblatt and Stanley Fish and Helen Vendler would not suddenly be freed to use their smarts to start making quantum proton-nuclear reactor cargo transporters, or whatever; they would all migrate someplace where they could still talk Shakespeare and Proust and the rest."
But where would that place be? Flyby decided to find out.
For Helen Vendler, Porter University Professor, it would be high school. "When I came into this profession, women found it hard to be appointed," Vendler wrote in an email. "I gave this some thought, and decided I was going to teach poetry somewhere—if not a college or university, then a high school. And that's what I'd try to do today, if I were a young person and my department were erased by the university."
University Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt responded to the question regarding his fallback career with a knowing smile: "Oh, quantum physics for sure." His second choice, he said, would be to write for The New Yorker.
As for the so-called "humanities crisis," Greenblatt noted that for him, the "humanities debate is more heat than light." He added, "There's a peculiar anxiety about [humanities]. We still live in a culture in which an enormous amount of time and energy is put into the creation and consumption of stories, art, and fantasies."
According to the experts, then, there's no need to pack up your copies of Baldwin and Shakespeare in bomb-proof shelters just yet—Greenblatt and Vendler are doubtful of this cosmic apocalypse in English studies. Soldier on, ye brave English concentrators!

Want to stay up to date with all the goings-on (and food Instagrams) of Harvard Square? There’s an app for that.
The Harvard Square Business Association announced yesterday that it is working with CO Everywhere, Inc. to beta test the new app “CO Everywhere”—a free iPhone app that allows you to follow all the content from various social media (Twitter, Facebook, Groupon, Foursquare, Instagram, and more) for a specific location such as Harvard Square.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the HSBA, wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson that this collaboration with CO Everywhere is part of a “long history of embracing new technologies” in Harvard Square. Jillson wrote that the HSBA chooses to partner with companies that can aid in the organization’s mission to promote business in the Square, and “CO Everywhere fits the bill.”

If you weren't on campus last year and feel like you're returning to a strange new world of over-emphasized collaboration policies and construction sites, you might have a few questions about what happened here at Harvard during the 2012-2013 school year. Flyby's here to answer them for you.
1. Why are there ceiling fans in Old Quincy? 
 
“Old” Quincy is actually pretty new—or at least the inside of it is. Old Quincy was renovated throughout last school year as the “test project” for Harvard’s ambitious House Renewal project—a plan to eventually renovate all 12 upperclassman Houses for over $1 billion.
 
If your next question is why there’s still construction near Quincy, we’ve got you covered. Renovations on Leverett’s McKinlock Hall are now underway, with that building slated to open next fall. Dunster is up next, with plans for renovation of the entire House during the 2014-2015 school year.
 
2. So what is this “Gov 1310” I keep hearing about?
 
Well, you’re definitely a freshman. This time last year, the Administrative Board—the College’s disciplinary body—was busy addressing Harvard’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory, which occurred when roughly 125 students were accused of plagiarizing or inappropriately collaborating on the final take-home exam in the spring 2012 course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.” Roughly 70 of those accused students were required to temporarily withdraw from the College.
3. Why is there an interim dean of the College?
 
The College’s top administrator, Donald H. Pfister, wasn’t so last spring—he just took the helm as interim dean in July. The departure of his  predecessor, Evelynn M. Hammonds, was announced in May.
 
Hammonds’s announcement came after a tumultuous year at the College that included the cheating scandal and a subsequent email search scandal (Harvard made the news a lot last year). News broke in March that administrators had secretly searched the administrative email accounts of resident deans after an internal email related to the cheating scandal was leaked to the media. In April, Hammonds told faculty that she had authorized a second set of searches without the necessary permission, breaking faculty email privacy policy.
 
4. So, was Hammonds fired?
 
Some have suggested that the scandal led to the end of Hammonds’s tenure. For her part, Hammonds has said that the scandal was “not a motivating factor” in her decision to step down from her post.
 
5. What’s all that stuff outside the Science Center?
 
This time last year, the Science Center Plaza was under construction (and it was throughout most of the academic year, in varying stages), to the dismay of students commuting to class in the Science Center. The renovated plaza opened in the spring, and is now a bright and shiny space featuring oversize bean bags and a large chess board.
