Philip J. Deloria’s transitional office inhabits the dimly lit basement of Robinson Hall. Even though it’s in the basement, the room has partly functional windows because it’s only 75 percent underground. “I like to brag that I have a corner office at Harvard with two windows,” he jokes.
Though Deloria, Harvard’s first tenured professor of Native American history, says this ironically, 18-year-old Deloria would likely react with genuine amazement. At that time, he was choosing to accept a small scholarship to study music at the University of Colorado. He remembers that his father, Vine Deloria Jr., accurately forecasted the years of his life after accepting the offer: “Men in the Deloria family don’t really figure out what they’re doing until they’re about 30.”

Long before that premonition, Deloria was born into a family steeped in history. On his paternal side, Deloria descends from a Yankton Dakota lineage, with the notable exception of a French fur trapper (hence Deloria, from the French Deslauriers). His great-grandfather worked as a minister at the Standing Rock Reservation. Following suit, Deloria’s grandfather also took up the ministry, working in Martin, a town between the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations.
Deloria’s grandfather married a woman from New Jersey, a descendant of a colonial family. Her family’s history, in total contrast to the Yankton Delorias’, includes slave ownership, participation in the Mexican-American War, and even the acquisition of Native American land.
Deloria’s prescient father, Vine Deloria Jr., broke away from the ministerial tradition and became an activist and scholar. During Deloria’s youth, his father served as the president of the National Congress of American Indians and worked assiduously to collect his family’s history, especially the correspondences of his anthropologist aunt, Ella Deloria.
This historical, activist milieu was fully encapsulated by Deloria’s childhood home in Colorado. Deloria remembers his childhood home as one in constant flux. They were “a family that [was] involved in education, that [was] mobile, and that [was] cosmopolitan,” he says.
Friends of Deloria’s father were constantly in and out of the house. Deloria remembers Ramblin’ Jack Elliott—“thought to be the bridge between Bob Dylan and Woodie Guthrie”—would visit the house with his two dogs. When one of the dogs chewed up the house’s door, Elliott apologized by giving Deloria a shirt that he still owns.
Deloria remembers that his father started hanging out in the Lion’s Head, a New York City bar frequented by writers and artists. During that time, writers often sojourned at the Deloria home. Writer Hyemeyohsts Storm—who, Deloria remembers, dried himself off with toilet paper rather than a towel—taught a young Deloria how to play the mandolin.
“The house was always full of people coming and going. Sometimes you’d see them and you’d chat with them. Sometimes you wouldn’t really see them and they wouldn’t really talk to you. They had other business,” Deloria remembers.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Deloria became “this nerd kid” obsessed with music. He picked up the clarinet in third grade and transitioned to the trombone after some years at the behest of his orthodontist, who observed the increasing crookedness of his teeth. “I accidentally, you know, got good,” he remembers. Deloria also began playing the guitar, though his skill has always been impaired by a shower door accident that left him with 52 stitches in his left wrist.
Despite his dark foresight, Deloria’s father encouraged him to pursue music. Deloria’s father introduced him to country-western artists like Slim Whitman and made him learn the song “Wildwood Flower” on guitar. Studying music in college seemed like the natural next step.
At the University of Colorado, Deloria wasted no time. “I kept running into all these banjo players,” he recalls—and so Deloria and his friends started a bluegrass band. Together, they were the first band to play at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall when it opened on St. Patrick’s Day in 1976. The band shivered outside as shoppers walked by. Deloria particularly remembers a beautiful woman who launched a paper airplane made out of a dollar bill into one of their open instrument cases. “We took whatever money we earned and went to the pizza place.”
Deloria and his friends embarked on a winding musical journey. Their band shapeshifted between playing bluegrass, country, top 40, and ’50s music. In the early ’80s the group became a new wave band. “We wore clothes with zippers and had a drummer with blue hair,” Deloria remembers.
Eventually, the band bought a cheap van and began playing gigs around Boulder. “We had an agent who booked us into a whole lot of crappy gigs.” The band’s first excursion in the van landed them in Glenrock, Wyo., a town with an estimated 1980 population of 2,736.
A flat tire about 30 miles out of Boulder caused the band to arrive late. When they eventually arrived, they unpacked their gear and began playing their new wave set, filled with songs by bands like The Cars and The Police. To the band’s great confusion, the audience shouted “one oh five, one oh five” throughout the set. When they took a break, the band discovered “one oh five” referred to the number of a song on the jukebox that the audience began playing repeatedly. The song, coincidentally, only had three chords, so the band wrote down the lyrics and played the song once they returned to the stage. “It was called ‘You Piss Me Off, You Fucking Jerk,’ which is just a stupid, stupid song,” Deloria recalls. Beatboxing the song’s truck-driver beat, Deloria sang me a refrain from the song from memory: “Well, it’s 40 below but I don’t give a fuck got a heater in the truck and I’m off to the rodeo (beatboxing) you piss me off (beatboxing) you fucking jerk (beatboxing) you get on my nerves.”
The experience of playing what Deloria calls “the most redneck thing ever” was a “kind of wake-up” for the young Deloria: “This is not fun.”
The next day, when the band was stuck in Glenrock because of more car trouble, Deloria suggested they visit Fort Fetterman, a 19th-century military base used by the U.S. Army when fighting Native American tribes. As he walked around the site, picking up old nails, he began to feel the tug of academia. “It was somewhere in there that I realized that I actually do kind of care about history and places and landscapes.”
After graduating from Boulder, Deloria entered what he calls his “lost years.” He realized he couldn’t compete with artists from schools like Juilliard for spots in symphonies, and began teaching middle school band while continuing to play guitar with his friends. After two years, he realized 30 years of teaching music “sounded really unfun” and began crewing for music video shoots. He also coached basketball. Those years, according to Deloria, “were great.”
Eventually, his father suggested that if he wanted to continue “messing around” he might as well go back to school. So Deloria returned to UC Boulder, this time for an M.A. in Journalism and Mass Communications, while still working as a substitute music teacher from time to time. Deloria began to think more actively about Native American issues, and, as his professional project, filmed a documentary about a land-claims issue around the Black Hills in South Dakota.  At the same time, Deloria took a class with historian Patricia Limerick, who suggested that he get a Ph.D. So he did. To study for the GRE, Deloria would make his gifted students work through math problems with him in exchange for a class-wide study hall.
Deloria followed his time as a Master’s student and substitute teacher with a Ph.D at Yale University. At Yale, Deloria’s life changed drastically. Though he was too nervous to speak during class his first semester, he succeeded in distinguishing himself. “I became an intellectual,” he recalls. Deloria “had a really good book idea in 30 seconds” and it became his dissertation.
After leaving Yale, Deloria returned to UC Boulder to teach, but found he no longer enjoyed the place that had nurtured him earlier. Deloria “had left Yale with way too much of a critical consciousness” to return to homogenous, privileged Boulder. It didn’t help that he had to share an office with his dad, who made a habit of smoking and “shooting the breeze” with his students. Deloria then moved to Michigan, where he taught songwriting and helped expand the Native Studies program at the University of Michigan.
Now, as he settles into Harvard, Deloria has a number of projects that he hopes will last him until the end of his career. He plans on writing a book about the “epistemological crisis” of the Lenoid meteor shower of 1833 and the ways different ethnicities and in-groups reacted to it. This work, he hopes, will explore the space between Native Studies and African-American Studies. Deloria also plans to complete a collection of essays in the future.
Though his office at Harvard currently lacks decoration, the few items he managed to bring from Michigan to Harvard speak to his colorful past and passion for Native American history. To the right of his desk hang two items: a black-and-white photo and a blue cloth satchel. The photo, taken by early 20th-century Kiowa photographer Horace Poolaw, depicts the Carnegie Indians baseball team, ca. 1933. The satchel contains sweet grass, tobacco, sage, Navajo jewelry, kazoos and cowbells. A friend gave Deloria the gift to thank him for taking part in a performance of Native music.
Unfortunately, arthritis and lack of time prevent him from practicing much these days. But most Sundays, Deloria can still be found playing country-western music with his friends.

Gerty MacDowell and her friends do not hold hands like regular people with emotional depth. Instead, they have “ten fingers locked.” We are discussing “Ulysses” in my humanities seminar, and a girl is pointing out the emptiness with which James Joyce paints his women. Sitting on the rocky beach with the lighthouse in the distance, she says, Gerty and her friends don’t embrace; they simply put their “arms round each other’s necks.” Their actions are mechanical and meaningless. Not smiling, but showing their teeth at one another.
After this digression, our conversation returns to the brilliance of Joyce, and I am flipping through the mental Rolodex I’ve been keeping—titled, “The History Of Western Literature And Also Everything Else As Told To Me By Boys In My Hum 10 Seminar.” In particular, I think of one boy who decried Jane Austen’s Emma with vitriol, and added as an afterthought: “Emma is the worst character we’ve read this semester.” We’d read The History of the Conquest of New Spain, for God’s sake! We’d read Inferno! Ugolino literally ate his own sons!
The likeable protagonist is a funny thing. Jenny Zhang writes on Gunter Grass’s famous The Tin Drum protagonist, Oskar, “We root for him. He’s so damaged and so lovable.”
“I know I am not the first woman to ask this,” she continues, “But how can I be both damaged and loveable? How do I become the protagonist of a story?”
Virginia Woolf, Joyce’s modernist contemporary, once refers to him in her diary as “a queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples.” But her distaste carries an undertone of envy. One can imagine the bruised resignation with which she adds on another date, “What I’m doing is probably being better done by Mr. Joyce.”
In A Room of One’s Own, Woolf mourns, if nothing else, lost time. Time lost to women in years of work, or years of intellectual freedom. This comes up in seminar, and a new aura of melancholy settles into the room. There is a current of resentment in reading this fat, shining object of intellectual freedom that doesn’t sit well with me or the rest of the class’s female contingent. We huddle at the end of class to nod and murmur.
Our professor, a woman, joins the cluster. She asks us if we feel inhibited in our work. We nod. “It’s difficult, I know,” she says. “You have to to fight to get there. Do you think you will get there?” Maybe, we respond, but we won’t get so far as we would have if we’d never had to spend that time fighting to begin with. She laughs and we laugh because our words are vague and amorphous, and we are saying very little, yet we are saying a lot. She says, “I know that we are speaking in very abstract terms, but I do think we all understand one another. And I do think the fighting makes you stronger, in the end.”
Which is why I’ve come to resent that every canonical work by a woman is, at some point in class, referred to as an act of catharsis. I’m not even sure I believe in catharsis anymore—at least not as Aristotle would have it; to wash away the passions at the end of the tragedy. This sounds like a ploy, if you ask me, to rob people of their tragedies after the fact. This is very clever. If no one has anything to gain or create from their strife, if strife is something to be sanitized under the bubbly sponge of catharsis, then the fighting does not make you stronger. If there’s no value in the process of fighting to offset the tragedy, then the strifeless keep their lead. Clever.
I’ve heard that dialects can be distinguished not by their differing vocabularies but by in their signals and noise. Words that are buried in the noise in one dialect might act as a blaring signal in another. I imagine a system of signals among women, except I think it goes further than words and extends into the wordless. Sometimes you just need fewer words when trying to explain something to another woman. Sometimes you can just make eye contact across the seminar table and know.
A few nights later I am at the Girlpool concert at the Paradise Rock Club. I run into a friend who dances alongside me, and she swears to God when she touches my shoulder blades a part of my soul goes into her. The next day she swears to God that, in her dream, the boy who’s been bothering me this week bothered her, too, except she thought it happened in real life for a moment, like she took this encounter out of me wordlessly.
Here is my thesis: Gerty MacDowell and her friends do not hold hands. They do not hug. They do much more. Flashing signals like lighthouses.

The repeal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States—in Sept. 2017 sent shockwaves across the country, creating a sense of crisis for undocumented students at Harvard and beyond. President Donald Trump announced the repeal of the executive order and called on Congress to pass permanent protections before DACA expired in six months.
Hours after the decision, University President Drew G. Faust denounced the move to repeal DACA as “cruel” in an email to Harvard affiliates. Act on a Dream, a student group centered around immigration advocacy, hosted a rally in Tercentenary Theatre attended by hundreds of Harvard affiliates. Act on a Dream ramped up their advocacy following the repeal, as did Faust.
Six months have passed since then. The much-publicized date of March 5 has served as a call to Congress to pass protections for undocumented individuals in the United States—but it is now essentially irrelevant. Wondering what happened and what that means? Here’s the DACA deadline, explained.
The Trump administration set the deadline in September as part of its plan for ending DACA, under which it designated March 5 the last day that DACA recipients could apply to renew their status. It was originally the date on which Congress would have to pass legislation in order to secure protections for undocumented students, according to Roberto G. Gonzales, a professor at the Graduate School of Education.
“In order to phase it out what they [the Trump administration] did is they set up a timeline by which folks could re-apply for the last time. So anybody that had their DACA expiring on March 6th and beyond would not have an opportunity to re-apply,” said Jason M. Corral, the staff attorney at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program.
But, according to Gonzales and Corral, the meaning of the deadline has changed. Two federal judges—one in California and another in New York—have halted the administration's termination of DACA. The administration asked the Supreme Court to weigh in early on these cases and the Court declined to do so. As a result, the lower courts are still accepting applications for DACA-recipients to renew their status, Corral said.
While the lower courts are still accepting renewal DACA renewal applications, offering a window of protection to DACA-recipients, Corral explained there is still concern about DACA recipients experiencing a lapse in their protections as they wait for renewal.
“It is kind of null and void, but it created this system by which it’s possible that some people will have a lapse in their status,” Corral said. “And there is a certain level of uncertainty because the Trump administration has shown that they wish to get rid of DACA.”
This “potential lapse in status”—meaning that some recipients could temporarily lose DACA status—has raised concerns among DACA recipients, according to Corral, who called it a “legal limbo.”
“It’s possible that they could have a lapse in their employment authorization or their DACA status, and while that might not be a huge issue, there is something called unlawful presence that sometimes prevents people from being able to take advantage of more permanent solutions in the future,” he said.
“That’s the big question,” Gonzales said.
Gonzales said that, since DACA began in 2012, DACA recipients have made “great gains,” especially in terms of increasing their earnings through lawful employment, maximizing their educational opportunities, obtain healthcare, and building credit through bank accounts and credit cards.
“In the process, they have been able to help out their families,” Gonzales said. “So, without DACA, those young people lose all of those points of access.”
As a result, Gonzales said that DACA-recipients and their families would need to make serious adjustments if the repeal passes.
“What could potentially happen is really akin to somebody losing their jobs and sort of becoming injured and losing their jobs and then becoming evicted and losing everything,” he said.
Faust has been an outspoken advocate for undocumented students. Since the repeal, she has penned letters, appeared on national television, and met with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in D.C. On Thursday, Faust made her most recent trip to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Michael Bennett, according to University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson. Jackson wrote in an email that Faust focused those discussions on DACA and Temporary Protection Status, a legal designation given to individuals from certain countries who have fled armed conflict or natural disasters.
In a February interview, Faust said the University plans to continue advocating on behalf of undocumented students affected by the Trump administration’s repeal of DACA and removal of TPS protections for individuals from certain countries.
“We are committed to our undocumented students and their security and safety and their ability to continue with their programs of study and likewise, the TPS individuals—many of whom are employees—have for the most part been in the United States for a very long time,” Faust said.
Amid the uncertainty surrounding the deadline, Jackson reaffirmed the University’s commitment to its undocumented students.
“Although we know the current court rulings do not provide the permanent security that is needed, we encourage current DACA enrollees who are up for renewal to renew their status during this open window created by the injunction,” Jackson wrote.
Last year, the University hired Corral as a full-time staff attorney to serve undocumented students at Harvard. Corral is currently working at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program to renew as many DACA applications as possible in the window of opportunity offered by the court injunctions.
“On top of that, we’re going to do individual consultations with each person to figure out if there are any longer term remedies outside of DACA or TPS so that they don’t have to rely on sort of legal limbo indefinitely, so that’s going to be a huge undertaking,” Corral said.
Corral said he prioritized the DACA recipients whose status is expiring in 2018 and he is now moving on to those whose status will expire in 2019.
The Harvard Immigration Clinic also serves as a resource for undocumented students who are not protected by DACA, according to Corral. He said he encourages these students to meet with him in order to discuss possible legal solutions for protecting their status.
Debate in Congress surrounding a long-term solution for the program is still ongoing.
“Of course Trump wants to get his wall built and some anti-immigrant people want to restrict or sort of take away family-based immigration or change the way that we process applications, so that’s one side of the debate,” Corral said. “And then the other side of debate is a pathway to citizenship.”
Corral said he thinks it is urgent for Congress to develop what he called a “band-aid solution” for the DACA program in order to eliminate the phase of legal limbo that DACA recipients are currently experiencing before moving on to more comprehensive reform.
Gonzales said it is unlikely that Congress will pass any legislation on immigration on March 5, but the debate will still continue over the termination of DACA and permanent solutions for undocumented immigrants. He said the March 5 deadline, though, still has meaning to undocumented immigrants and their allies.
“March 5 is still in people’s minds and it is still the kind of statement to think about how Congress should be acting soon,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a night.
With just over a minute left in overtime and with Harvard up 86-85 against Cornell, what might’ve the biggest play of the night happened outside of Lavietes Pavilion.
In fact, it happened all the way in New Haven.
In the heat of a neck-and-neck game, Crimson fans looked up to see the Bulldogs had beaten Penn 80-79 on a last second layup from Yale freshman forward Paul Atkinson. The Penn loss puts Harvard’s hopes of a conference title in its own hands—that is, if the Crimson could come away with the win on Friday night.
With 27 ticks to go, junior guard Joel Davis made a layup to give the Big Red—a team still fighting for a spot in the conference tournament—the lead. On the ensuing possession, and with just under ten seconds on the clock, sophomore guard Seth Towns received the ball at the top of the key. After a pump fake, Towns crossed over his defender and drove towards the rim, but was fouled before throwing up a shot.
With five seconds on the clock, the sophomore headed to the line with the chance to give Harvard the lead. He missed the first, but made the second, tying the game at 87. Seconds later, a 30-foot heave from junior guard Matt Morgan clanged off the back iron.
The Crimson headed into a second overtime. Heading into this frame, though, a win assured a shot at the conference title.
And it showed.
The Crimson (16-12, 11-2 Ivy) would outscore Cornell (11-15, 5-8 Ivy) 11-1 in double overtime, coming away with the 98-88 win.
THREE AND D
In what has slowly become a staple of the Crimson’s offense in conference play, the Crimson shot the lights out from deep on Saturday. Led by sophomore wing Justin Bassey, who finished the night shooting four-of-five from three, the Crimson shot a blistering 48 percent from beyond the arc.
In the second half in particular, Harvard needed all of the long balls that it could get. Over a stretch of just under three minutes, Morgan—currently the eighth-leading scorer in the nation—rattled off 11 straight points for the Big Red. He finished the night tying his season-high of 34 points on 12-of-22 shooting from the field.
“There was a stretch in the second half where he came out and hit three or four threes in a row for them,” Bassey said. “Going into media timeout we really have to emphasize slowing them down and figuring out how was he getting the shots, where we were breaking down to where he was getting wide-open looks at the hoop.”
Despite the early foul trouble, Towns matched Morgan shot-for-shot, scoring 10 of the Crimson’s 12 points over the same stretch.
For the Crimson, it was the long ball that kept it in the game. Harvard shot six-of-nine from deep in the second frame while ending an early stretch of turnovers that saw it cough up the ball over 11 times through the first 20 minutes of play.
“I think we a little bit too riled up when they got into their 1-2-2 press and that led to us being a little too aggressive and making poor decisions against the press and leading to a lot of turnovers,” Bassey said. “Just being a little bit tighter and more aware of our surroundings.”
Though the early turnovers cost the Crimson early, it made up for it on the defensive end. Harvard held Cornell to 32 percent shooting through the first frame and 39 percent on the game.
IN THE PAINT AND AT THE LINE
While the Crimson certainly thrived from beyond the arc, Harvard’s post play, and in particular sophomore forward Chris Lewis’ play, carried the Crimson for much of the night.
The sophomore tallied a career-high 29 points on 11-of-13 shooting from the field to go with seven rebounds. Despite committing a late foul that would send the game to its first overtime, Lewis came through to seal the win late.
Holding on to a one-point lead with 1:12 to go in the second overtime, the Crimson broke the Cornell press and junior guard Corey Johnson passed the ball to Lewis near the baseline. Lewis rose up and emphatically dunked the ball over the Cornell defender and through the foul. The sophomore made the free throw to give the Crimson a two possession lead it would hold until the buzzer sounded.
“You look at Lewis’ production, and we have to play through him as we know. Obviously the foul he made late, which gave them the chance at the and-one when we were up three was just a tremendous let down,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “But I thought he was really possessed and determined, especially when we had to go to overtime, to win it. He played sensational basketball there as well.”
Though the Big Red struggled to find the back of the net early in the game, an early stretch of fouls kept Cornell in the game. The Big Red went to the like 16 times in the first frame alone, converting on 13 of those.
Despite Cornell keeping it close at the line, the Crimson would close it out from the charity stripe.
With both teams in the bonus heading into overtime, Harvard found itself at the line for much of the rest of the way, going 12-of-13 through two overtimes while sending standout Cornell forward Stone Gettings to the bench after earning his fifth personal foul at the 2:45 mark in the second overtime.
“We needed to make sure we were focused and ready for the challenge in front of us which we knew would be a challenge—they were fighting for their lives to make it to the conference tournament and they played like it. We knew that, we know how hard it was going to be this weekend, starting tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker has always been partial to the phrase, “our conference is won on Saturday nights.”
Playing against Columbia with the conference title on the line, Amaker’s words rang truer than ever.
Behind a season-high 63 percent shooting from the field and 61 percent shooting from three, the Crimson (17-12, 12-2 Ivy) handed the visiting Lions (8-19, 5-9) a 93-74 loss at Lavietes Pavilion. The win gave Amaker his sixth conference title since arriving in Cambridge and assures Harvard the No. 1 seed heading into next weekend’s Ivy League tournament.
“I’m really proud of the journey this team has been on, to close it out here at home,” Amaker said. “You don’t get many chances to come around like that, with Senior Night at home, for the Ivy League Championship, to play for it like that. We can call ourselves Ivy League Champions and we can put a banner up.”
Though Saturday’s contest began with the Crimson leading by as many as 17 in the first half and ended with a lead as high 25 late in the second, a 13-0 run from Columbia between the first and second frames put the Harvard lead at just seven one minute into the second half.
Much like it had in the first half—the Crimson began the night shooting a blistering 9-of-13 through the first sixteen minutes of play—Harvard stormed back by shooting lights out. Over a six-minute stretch from the 17:13 mark to 11:10, the Crimson went on a 17-6 run to give itself a 20-point lead.
The Crimson finished the night with 17 made threes—tying the program record set in 2002. Headlining the Harvard effort was junior guard Corey Johnson. The junior finished the night with a season-high 17 points on 5-of-8 shooting from deep.
“We shoot the ball very well as a team, we have a lot of weapons especially from beyond the arc and so like every game one person can go off and hit open shots, Seth can do it, Bassey can do it, Juzang,” Johnson said. “Tonight, they left me open so I hit a couple big shots but I owe it all to my teammates to find me when I’m open.”
Starting its three seniors to close out their careers at Lavietes, the Crimson struggled to miss a shot through the first thirteen minutes of play.
Harvard began its scoring with a put-back dunk courtesy of captain Chris Egi just over a minute in—from there it wouldn’t look back. Behind the red-hot shooting from beyond the arc and some of the best ball movement that it has seen all season, the Crimson jumped out to a 35-18 lead with 7:16 still to play before intermission.
Over that opening stretch, Harvard shot 65 percent from the field and a blistering 72 percent from deep.
“We were certainly shooting the ball very well, look at our shooting percentages,” Amaker said. “We only went to the line two times and had 14 turnovers, but shooting 17 threes, I thought was incredible. In the first half, that got us out of the blocks. I thought we scored and got a lot of confidence. We played in transition, we played with great pace.”
Though the Lions mounted a late 9-0 run and pressed the Crimson in the dwindling minutes of the contest, the early stretch gave Harvard the early lead and one that it would hold onto the rest of the way. The Crimson tallied a season-high 24 assists and for the second night in a row saw four players in double digits. In what was likely Harvard’s best all-around effort, seven Crimson players scored six or more points on Saturday night.
On a senior night that saw Harvard’s first bucket scored by an outgoing senior, the last shot also came fittingly from a fourth-year. With the game decided, Amaker checked in his three veterans with just over a minute to go. As the shot clock wound down late in the contest, senior guard Andre Chatfield buried one from deep to the joy of the 1,636 in attendance. On the Crimson’s last possession, sophomore guard Christian Juzang handed the ball off to Egi to allow the captain to dribble out the clock and cap off the conference title.
The three seniors were freshmen the last time that Harvard took home the Ivy League crown.
“Coach always says that this league is won on Saturday nights, so we had an opportunity ahead of us,” Egi said. “I guess it was one of those things, like when you have a chance to win a championship, it doesn’t matter what you did the night before. I know all the guys on this team, everybody wanted to win and I think that’s just what drove us today.”

Dear Linkmate,
Throughout February, I labored long and hard to create the perfect blocking group, choosing my friends wisely, sabotaging other blocking groups for the good of my own, and being sure to stop that weird kid from sliding into the eighth spot. Despite my meticulous methods on the blocking front, I didn’t really put much thought into linking. I guess it just seemed like the only purpose of linking was to make sure your significant other is close enough that their room isn’t too far away in the middle of the winter, but far enough that you don't need to make daily awkward eye contact with them when the inevitable happens.
I guess what I’m trying to say is...who are you?
We linked with your blocking group because of our friend who had too many other friends to fit into our blocking group, and since you’re his friend, I’m sure you’re just great. And if you suck, it doesn’t really matter. If we haven’t spoken up until now, why would we start?
Admittedly, I feel a little bad that I’ve never really met you, that our interactions have been limited to vague recognitions in Annenberg. I couldn't even come up with your last name to Facebook-stalk you, and yet I’ve entered into the divine contract of linking with you. But we’ll be in different houses with different dhalls, so will I ever see you? Probably not. Will I ever even see the people in my own blocking group? TBD.
Anyway, nice to meet you.
Let’s grab a meal sometime,Your linkmate

Enter a House described as a constant vacation, where huge singles abound and you can finally live out your futuristic transportation dreams at a Segway study break. Be honest—what more could you want from a House than singles and Segways?



If there’s one defining feature of Currier housing, it’s the big singles. As HoCo co-chair Anne M. Raheem ’19 says, “I don’t know why they’re so big...they’re shockingly massive,” while HoCo co-chair Danielle E. Katz ’19 adds, “I can do cartwheels in my room. It’s bigger than my room at home.”
Currier housing is split between four towers, each of which is named for a distinguished Radcliffe alumna. Currently, more sophomores sorted into Currier are living in doubles to make up for River Houses’ smaller intake, which has been affected by construction. But many sophomores get their very own singles, living in Daniels, where the typical rooming arrangement is a single with a hall bathroom. In other towers, some get lucky with singles and ensuite bathrooms.
Currierites have an abundance of common spaces with great names to choose from, including the Fishbowl, the Treehouse, the Mousehole, and the Beehive. Those into cooking or baking will enjoy the kitchens on every floor, while the gym rats will appreciate the Currier Fitness Suite, as well as QRAC just across the street.
While saying the House has “a great sense of community” is a bit cliche, it’s true! Community is central to Currier’s identity. Leading Currier’s community are the two faculty deans, Sylvia Barrett ’94 and Latanya Sweeney ’95, who are beloved by Currierites for being extremely engaged. In order to foster this wonderful community, Currier hosts very frequent outings, which have previously included indoor skydiving, ice skating, and trips to Cape Cod, so there’s always a new way to burst the Harvard bubble.
Some of Currier’s unique traditions include Currieroke, in which Currierites can get together and sing their hearts out, and Currier Coffeehouses held several times per semester, where the hidden talents of fellow students are revealed in an open mic-like setting. If you’re less into performing, Currier Cinema is a weekly event in which you get to sit back and enjoy the show.
Currier also prides itself on being a tech-friendly House, with an Amazon Alexa in the Mousehole, digital photo frames, and, of course, the aforementioned Segways. And because Currier apparently doesn’t have enough common spaces already, the House will also soon be getting a Makerspace.

Currier’s building manager refers to the House as the “Quad Resort,” and Raheem agrees, noting that “it feels like you’re relaxing in a hotel,” and that people tend to be a bit more laid-back, stopping to pause and chat with each other. She also appreciates that somehow people seem to be up 24/7, so you can always find a dhall study buddy, even at 3 a.m. Currier’s small size, Quad location, and enthusiastic residents make for a House in which the community is unrivaled, or, as Katz puts it, “freshman should be excited about getting a family in Currier.”
If you’re still not completely sure about Currier, Raheem and Katz are here with the answers to some of your most pressing questions:
If your House was a fruit, what fruit would it be?
DK: A pineapple—spunky and tangy, but sweet.
AR: Currier: Sweet on the inside, fun on the outside.
So what’s the deal with Currier’s mascot, Woody?
DK: I think it describes the atmosphere in Currier pretty well...it’s kind of silly and no one takes themselves too seriously.
AR: We may have a tree, but we get so behind our tree.
What’s something future Currierites should look forward to?
AR: Housing Day. People get lit and everyone makes the funniest signs. Storming is a huge deal. We might even have some surprises for the freshmen that are not common swag handouts; they’re going to be great. Stay tuned, freshmen.
DK: Coming in here you’re kinda scared that you may not know people and you just want to be at the River where all of your friends are, but everybody who gets Currier is so nice, and you automatically make friends with everybody.

Surrounding the Quad lawn on all sides is Cabot House, known for its high piano per capita and named for one of Boston’s oldest families. With its strong emphasis on community, a plethora of singles, and Rakesh cameos in annual theater productions, Cabot is definitely worth getting Quadded for.


Cabot surrounds the Quad lawn on all sides, so, needless to say, it has a lot of space. All of the buildings except for the Islands are connected by an underground tunnel system, meaning you can go to the dhall in the dead of winter in your pajamas, and then crawl back into bed without ever having to go outside. Good.
Sophomores will end up in either hallway singles, n housing (the same number of rooms as there are people in the suite), or n+1 housing (everyone gets a single!). That’s right. A single your sophomore year. Let that sink in for a second.
Entryways are oriented both vertically in the Islands (cf. Wigg), and by floor (cf. Weld), but both setups facilitate community.
We interviewed Hayley E. Edgerley ’19 and Jack W. Deschler ’19, the HoCo co-chairs of Cabot House, about the things that make Cabot special.
Incoming sophomores itching to get involved in House life can get started right off the bat with Cabot HoCo’s sophomore rep program, where a sophomore can sign up to help out with a HoCo position. Both Edgerley and Deschler first joined HoCo through this program in their sophomore years, and unsurprisingly, they spoke emphatically about Cabot’s community.
“Community I would say is Cabot’s number one priority,” Edgerley says. “From students to tutors to the Khuranas, [they] really put in a lot of effort to make this a really special and warm, welcoming place from the second sophomores…or even freshmen on Housing Day walk into the House.”
The student-run Cabot Café is a focus of House life and is open Sunday through Thursday all the way until 1 a.m., attracting both pset-ers and casual café-goers. Deschler highlighted two traditions unique to Cabot—Cabot Culinaries, where a group of students cook a nice meal once a month for other Cabot residents, and Cabot Formal Hall, where students dress up for a fancy dinner once a month.

“Everything, I think, is organized around bringing people together,” Deschler says.
When asked about their favorite Cabot memory, the co-chairs had many to choose from. However, Edgerley says that hers was Quad Formal, “Having everyone in Cabot and everyone in Currier and Pfoho…come together on the Quad Lawn…it’s kind of magical.”
For Deschler, it was the Cabot Musical. “I sort of stumbled into directing High School Musical in the Cabot Theater last spring,”  he explains. “Everyone from different walks of life in the House was coming together…to support this one thing and it was really really cool.”
Still don’t know how to feel about living in Cabot? We got Deschler and Edgerley to answer some of your (likely) most burning questions:
Okay, I like to party. How do I party in Cabot? How do I get home after if I party at the River?
JD: Each Quad House has its own dedicated party room. Cabot’s is called the Aquarium and the fact that there are so many suites in the House means that a lot of people are able to put together their own social gatherings…which isn’t necessarily possible in a lot of other living configurations.
HE: Half the time that I would go out [last year] I would end up being in the Quad anyway, because there is a lot going on here on the weekends. The shuttle has always made me feel very safe…you’re probably close to some shuttle stop. There is also a night van service that will pick you up from whatever location and drop you back at the Quad, if you feel uncomfortable walking home at late hours.
Tell us a fun fact about Cabot.
JD: Cabot has the highest piano to student ratio, with a Steinway in every common room.
Closing thoughts?
JD: No Cabot, no America.
(Something you will understand apparently if you get housed in Cabot.)

UPDATED March 5, 2018 5:45 P.M. 
Pfun pfact: There’s more to Pforzheimer than the notorious Igloo, so check out all the amazing benepfits this House has to offer. With its very own orthography, massage chairs, and House guinea pigs, you’ll never even pfeel the need to leave the Quad. Trust us, one look at this House, and you’ll wonder why getting Quadded was ever considered a bad thing.


In terms of housing, it can’t get much better than Pfoho suites. According to HoCo co-chair and active Crimson editor Krystal K. Phu ’19, there is a 97 percent chance that you can get a single as a sophomore due to their convenient n+1 housing system. If you’re the type to enjoy roommate life, however, you can still opt for doubles or suites—with the addition of a kitchen. Sounds like it’s too good to be true? That’s just Pfoho life for you.
Within Comstock, Moors, Holmes, Wolbach, and the Jordans, suites in Pfoho can vary widely in layout. You can live in connected hallway singles or suite-style rooms or duplexes. Although the Jordans are farther away from the main House—to the point of being called “the Quad of the Quad”—these former apartment suites boast the n+1 housing system with three singles, a kitchen, and a bathroom. A pretty suite deal, right? Rainbow Yeung '19, former Crimson editor, Pfoho HoCo co-chair, and former Jordans resident, agrees that living in the Jordans was ultimately a positive experience.
Moreover, the Belltower suite, so large and in-demand that it has its own lottery, offers four singles and an enormous common room within a four-person suite (hence n+1). If you’re sorted into Pfoho, rejoice in the fact that you’ll be living in practically hotel-standard housing for the next three years.
Partially due to its inherently warm culture, the community in Pfoho is unparalleled. Its various social events and House traditions foster a true pfamily. Throughout the year, Pfoho’s Faculty Deans, Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant, work hard to secure funding for fun outings such as bubble soccer, barbeques, and the annual dog sledding trip. A particular Pfoho specialty is Pfoho Pfridays, a weekly opportunity to eat food catered from local restaurants, vibe to music, have drinks, and hang out in the Junior Common Room.
When they’re not basking in a seemingly endless supply of food and snacks, Pfoho residents also love to engage in their community through Just Dance and rounds of a Pfoho-popular deduction game known as Secret Hitler, in which players must team up to stop hidden fascists. There’s never a dull moment in the House since its residents, tutors, and Pfaculty Deans all make an effort to organize events and brighten the community.
Granted, you might be skeptical of just how inclusive this community may be toward a newly sorted Pfoho-ser like you. Don’t worry; Pfoho welcomes new residents with traditions such as Quadded, a fun event for rising Quadlings to rejoice in their stellar living conditions, and a sophomore orientation program, which includes a solidarity barbeque, Target run, and seafood dinner with more lobster than you can possibly imagine. Pfoho even provides U-Haul trucks to transport your belongings to the Quad, an initiative that other Houses in the Quad hadn’t adopted until recently.
As a final note, Pfoho offers additional relaxation-centric amenities, including the Spfa and guinea pig therapy delivered by the House’s most loved critters, Pfoebe and Pfiona. Compared with all this, a 15 minute walk to the Yard is a simple trade-off. 
Have some lingering doubts about Pfoho? We caught up with its HoCo chairs for more inpfo:
What is the biggest misconception about your House?
RY: That Quad housing is bad. That the Quad is bad.
KP: I think a lot of freshmen are afraid of the distance, and it makes a lot of sense because it is a longer walk from some of the Houses on the river. But, you know, we don’t disappear into the ether when we walk to the Quad. We walk back to a community that’s really warm and exciting to be in.
If you had to change one thing about your House, what would it be?
RY: None. People are going to have to drag me out [of Pfoho] when I’m cold and dead. I’m not saying that Pfoho is perfect. I’m saying when Pfoho is compared to other Houses, I do not want to transfer for anything in the world.
KP: We do get a lot of concerns from athletes and humanities students who say that living in the Quad makes it more difficult to commute to where they need to be. If I could change one thing, I would somehow make some larger adjustment to make the lives of these students easier.
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House?
KP: We love our freshmen already. We don’t even know who they are.
RY: Pfoho is going to be one of the greatest communities for you in these coming years. If you’re willing to give a part of yourself to the House, the House will give back. Be excited to be a part of this because we already care about you, and we can’t wait to meet you!
