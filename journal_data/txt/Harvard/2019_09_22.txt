After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was an average Wednesday in the late-night television cosmology, by all discernible metrics — until Kim Kardashian West, during the evening’s compulsory Kardashian appearance, revealed that she does not have a voicemail.
The disclosure occurred during a friendly game of “Show Me Your Phone” between Kardashian West and human wind-up toy Jimmy Fallon, in which various buttons on a screen prompted the two to display some element of their private phone usage to the viewing public. Previous demands had included “show us the last texts between you and your spouse” and “show us your last Google search.” (Kardashian West, a billionaire multi-hyphenate mogul with robust resources and immense product-testing enginery, had Googled: “is shapewear better with pee hole.”)
The next shock unfolded in real time. Five minutes into the segment, a benign question appeared: “What is your voicemail greeting when people call you?”
“It’s normal, I think, it’s just me saying I’m not here,” Jimmy Fallon, indeed a “normal” human, said.
“I don’t even have voicemail,” Kardashian West responded.
A nervous hush swept the crowd, then a titter. Fallon furrowed his brow in a way that did not at all seem scripted.
“That’s, like, ancient,” she followed. “Just call me or text me.” Having decimated the stately bedrock of American communication, she turned to the audience. “Does anyone have voicemail these days?” A significant chunk of the faceless crowd — comprised, ostensibly, of New York City teenagers who were either far more with the times than this writer or pathologically compelled to satisfy the siren song of Kardashian’s West complete dissociation from the human condition — screamed, “Nooooo.”
Somewhere far away, Kim Kardashian West’s dentist gasped and realized why her star patient never showed up for her appointments.
As to how and why anyone would actually delete, or deactivate their voicemail in the present day, WikiHow makes a number of strong points. It notes that some phone providers charge extra for a voicemail service; that no one enjoys the cat-and-mouse game of phone tag that it can generate; that the process of deactivation is really quite easy on most phones.
Yet there are some obvious logistical and emotional benefits to the possession of a voicemail. A call from a pay phone, for instance, cannot be made again at a more appropriate time. Birthday messages that flood a line — Kardashian West’s, for the sake of argument — either go unheard or must be mutably translated into text, a far less effusive medium.
Plus, a good game of voicemail phone tag, both elusive and exhilarating despite its minor frustrations, is a truncated facsimile of exchanging snail mail over long distances. It allows excitement to build, for two individuals to work hard in order to hear the other’s voice. In the age of email, one’s voicemail can serve as a distinctly intimate space, preserved for the communiques too important for text yet too personal for Outlook.
Of course, the word of the Kardashians is not law, as of yet — especially not when decreed from the middling soapbox of late-night television. It is doubtful that Verizon will see a significant uptick in voicemail cancellation attempts. But Kim Kardashian West is indubitably a harbinger of certain tastes. And when Kanye West and family deployed to Wyoming for the making and spiritual celebration of his album “ye,” the Wyoming Office of Tourism took notice. If Kim Kardashian West ever turns this sound bite into a crusade, voicemail devotees would do well to administer last rites.
Voicemail isn’t analog, exactly. But it is a vestige of times past, when a phone call meant more than a text, when a text didn’t exist. Voicemail diminishes the immediacy of communication in the digital age. Without voicemail, the modern consumer is perpetually at the mercy of the digital connective tissue that erases time and individuation. A call, and thus a person, is either accepted or rejected; a text responded to or ignored. Any liminal space between a person and their social fabric evaporates, swallowed by read receipts and Caller ID.
But Kim Kardashian West said voicemail is dead, and so it soon must be. One hopes she is carving out quality time for herself and her loved ones in the nonstop choke of a voicemail-less world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was Groundhog Day – albeit five months early – in San Diego, history repeating itself three quarters in a row as the Crimson transcended time zones to take on its first competitor of the season. However, the only shadow that those at Torero Stadium saw this Saturday was that of the football gliding from the hands of San Diego quarterback Reid Sinnett to his endzone-bound receivers. The opening few seconds of the contest’s first and second quarters were eerily similar: both were initiated with a passionate cry of “touuuchdown, San Diego!” as each impeccable pass set the stage for the subsequent fifteen minutes. Spectators were left wondering if, in the spirit of Bill Murray, they truly were reliving the same quarter over and over again – or if Sinnett was just that damn good. In the end, Sinnett and the Toreros proved just good enough, staving off a late Harvard comeback attempt to take home a 31-23 victory.
Coming into the game, Harvard had never been outscored by the Toreros, holding a 3-0 series lead against its Pioneer League competitors. Though the squad lost a whopping 31 seniors since it last took the gridiron, the Crimson was coming off of a three-game win streak from the 2018 season, “antsy” to once again pick up the pigskin.
However, Harvard was noticeably lacking one significant senior. Captain Wesley Ogsbury was barred from taking the field due to a controversial helmet-to-helmet contact penalty during last year’s season finale against Yale. His emergence from the locker room at halftime certainly contributed to a last-ditch, fourth-quarter effort by Harvard to take down its California competitor. Regardless, this attempted comeback was for naught, with the “West Coast, best coast” mentality overcoming any confidence the Crimson may have held.
Ogsbury was not the only noticeable absence from the Harvard sideline. Running back Aaron Shampklin and wide receiver Tyler Adams were not in uniform for the Crimson’s opening contest. The pair of juniors are not enrolled in classes this semester, but are expected back to the team next fall.
For Harvard, the beginning of the end was spelt out within the game’s first seven seconds. The Crimson’s opening kick seemed to have relegated the Toreros to their own side of the field, but that was about the best Harvard could do. In his first throw of the game, the dead-set Sinnett launched a 65-yard pass to receiver Michael Bandy, making for the first pass, completion, and touchdown of the game. While Sinnett may have been the best a team can get, for San Diego, the addition of receiver Michael Bandy was certainly fine and dandy.
“We played what we were capable of doing on both sides of the ball,” said San Diego coach Dale Lindsey. “I mean, our offense has really been a delight, they've been a surprise. Reid [Sinnett]’s been exceptionally good – we know Bandy can play, there some other receivers there. Our offense has been able to run the ball, they sustain drives, they get the big plays.”
If history repeated itself at the start of the second quarter, the third quarter saw history stop in its tracks and turn a complete 180. The Bandy-Sinnett duet was replaced with a Smith-Chrest twosome as Harvard quarterback Jake Smith lofted a 75-yard heave to receiver Cody Chrest for the Crimson’s first touchdown of the game. The rest of the quarter saw the two teams toil through the trenches, with each Torero penalty countered by a Harvard incompletion. However, the gains that the Crimson made were rendered irrelevant – Sinnett’s mid-quarter drive down the field ended in a rushing touchdown, bringing the score to a solid 31-7.
That’s when the tides began to turn. Though the fourth-quarter was the only of its kind not to see a touchdown reception within the first ten seconds, a Smith lob to freshman tight end Kyle Klink upped the Crimson’s total by six – something that Harvard could certainly Klink it’s glass to. A sloppy San Diego drive sent the ball back into Smith’s hands, with the Crimson crusader sending an 80-yard pass to junior receiver Jack Cook for the fourth successful downfield bomb of the game.
“I just think these [last] three games have been against really, really good competition,” Lindsey said. “If you look at this Harvard team what I noticed about them is they recruited tall and guys with length. They didn’t have little short arm guys out there, all their players were tall with long arms. Coach has done a great job there. I'll tell you what, I'd like to have some of his players come here and play.”
The Toreros’ offensive hustle in the first quarter was matched by the squad’s defensive dominance – a speedy seven-play, 23-yard drive by the Crimson, their first of the afternoon, forced a punt and sent the pigskin back into the hands of Sinnett.
The next ten minutes were fatal for Harvard. The only time the competitors from Cambridge even felt the ball over the course of that period – a decade in Football Time® – was during a failed interception attempt by linebacker Jack McGowan. That was the only instance where San Diego appeared to be even close to losing possession.
“They possess the ball for 34 minutes a game,” said Harvard coach Tim Murphy. “Which means they stay on the field for offense.”
Two of Bandy’s signature snags saved the Toreros from facing early-drive fourth downs, bringing San Diego to a whopping 77 yards on the drive. However, replacing Sinnett with running quarterback Alex Farina proved to be a fatal flaw for the offense; even after Sinnett was sent back out onto the field after a failed pass by Farina, the Toreros couldn’t get their mojo back. San Diego had to settle for the field goal, but those easy three points were three points better than the Crimson could do, as an unsuccessful Harvard drive sent both teams into the second quarter.
As Bandy’s reign of dominance was coming to an end, San Diego receiver Dalton Kincaid’s was just beginning. Within seven seconds, the Nevada native nabbed a Sinnett hail mary in the endzone, pushing the Toreros’ lead up to 17. A near-safety in the next play threatened to bump that lead by a pair of points, but a facemask penalty on San Diego saved the Crimson from being taken down in its own endzone.
A combination of two 19-yard rushes by Harvard running back Devin Darrington dared to put the Crimson on the scoreboard, but a missed field goal by senior kicker Jake McIntyre dashed any hopes of a first-half comeback. Sinnett, the ball back in Torero hands, decided to vary his arsenal of receivers with an 18-yard toss to Alex Spadone at the tail-end of his next drive, resulting in yet another Torero touchdown. A disheartened Harvard then ran out the clock, bringing the half – and any promise of a Crimson scoreboard appearance – to an end.
The Toreros’ latter half was defined by penalties and fumbles. However, their second-semester senior mentality was not enough to propel Harvard to victory. Down by 11, an important McIntyre field goal cut the deficit to eight points. Adding to its significance, the kick made McIntyre the school’s all-time leader in field goals.
The late kick brought the score to 31-23, a total at which the count was destined to stay. An interception by San Diego safety Daniel Tolbert with a minute left in the game cemented victory for the Toreros, bringing the bullfight to an end and leaving the Crimson seeing red.
