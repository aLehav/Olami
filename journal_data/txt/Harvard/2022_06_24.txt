After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 27, 2022 at 4:52 p.m.
After being placed on two years of administrative leave due to allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation, Harvard professor John L. Comaroff will return to the classroom to teach an elective course this fall, reigniting a wave of campus and national outrage.
Claudine Gay, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, placed Comaroff, a professor of African and African American Studies and Anthropology, on unpaid leave in January after a pair of investigations found that Comaroff violated the University’s sexual harassment and professional misconduct policies.
Gay also announced that Comaroff was barred from teaching required courses through the coming academic year, but did not mention elective courses. She added she will determine whether to lift his sanctions at the end of the 2022-2023 academic year.
Comaroff’s course, African and African American Studies 190X: “The Anthropology of Law: classical, contemporary, comparative, and critical perspectives,” is an elective lecture course listed in the FAS that is open to students from Harvard Law School. The course, which Comaroff has previously taught, currently has no limit in class capacity.
The FAS first placed Comaroff on paid leave in August 2020 after a Crimson investigation found that at least three students in the Anthropology Department had been in contact with the University’s Title IX Office regarding allegations of unwanted touching, verbal sexual harassment, and professional retaliation by Comaroff.
Thousands retweeted a tweet by Jessica E. K. Van Meir, a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy, criticizing Harvard for Comaroff’s return to teaching. In the tweet, Van Meir asked the University to explain “why the professor you found responsible for sexually harassing his student is again...teaching students.”
Van Meir said Friday the sanction barring Comaroff from teaching required courses is “a total joke of a punishment,” since he may teach non-required courses, granting him access to students.
“It’s not really a punishment,” she said. “A professor who sexually harasses those students — who has been found responsible of sexually harassing their students — should be fired.”
Steven C. Caton, a professor of Contemporary Arab Studies in the Anthropology Department, said although Comaroff would not violate the terms of his sanctions by teaching an elective course, it is “unwise” for the AAAS Department to offer the course.
“It does give the impression to me as an outsider that there was no conversation regarding the wisdom of this or the possible perceptions of this course being offered within Afro-Am,” he said. “It gives the impression that it’s business as usual.”
Caton was one of 15 tenured Anthropology professors who called on Comaroff to resign in February.
Anoushka Chander ’25, a prospective concentrator in AAAS, wrote in an email that the decision to allow Comaorff to teach is “disrespectful” to those who brought forward complaints of harassment.
“It devalues the importance of the allegations of the students and speaks volumes to whether the voices of students are going to be taken seriously by the University on the incredibly important matter of sexual harassment and misconduct,” she wrote.
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in a statement that all faculty have teaching obligations, and that department chairs do not have control over faculty members’ duties after they return from leave.
“Per Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) policy, all faculty are expected and required to fulfill the teaching requirements of their department,” she wrote. “Further, it is not within a departmental chair’s discretion to determine whether a faculty member can return to faculty duties, including teaching, following an administrative leave.”
According to Dane, course planning occurs in advance of the semester, and many classes listed in advance are canceled or switch instructors by the start of the semester.
Harvard’s investigations found that Comaroff “engaged in verbal conduct that violated the FAS Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and the FAS Professional Conduct Policy,” Gay wrote in her January announcement.
Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, one of Comaroff’s lawyers, wrote in an email that Comaroff is in “full compliance with Dean Gay’s requirements for his return from leave,” adding that the findings of the University’s Title IX investigation into his alleged behavior do not warrant the further sanctions “urged in this twitter storm.”
“We would like to emphasize that despite the lurid allegations of the lawsuit and the publicity surrounding them, Harvard’s very thorough process found Professor Comaroff not responsible for the majority of the allegations against him, and not responsible for the most serious of the claims,” she wrote.
O’Meara-Costello said Comaroff still disputes the conclusions of Harvard’s investigations, which hinged upon office hour sessions where Comaroff “gave advice which he maintains was entirely appropriate” and “in one case, necessary to protect one of the students from danger” in the field.
“If this outcry involves an effort to persuade Harvard to impose sanctions for conduct which its investigator found to be unsupported by the evidence, it is seeking a manifest injustice that would set a terrible precedent for discipline of both students and faculty,” O’Meara-Costello added.
Ash E. Tomaszewski, a student at the Law School, criticized the school for offering the course.
“FAS found him guilty of some degree of sexual harassment and took some degree of actions,” they said. “And HLS still thought it was appropriate to cross-list his class and put students in harm’s way.”
Hannah L. Finnie, a student at the Law School, said many law students at Harvard do not know about the sanctions placed on Comaroff and called on the school to communicate that to students before listing his course.
Lisa A. Burns, the assistant dean and registrar of the Law School, wrote in an email obtained by The Crimson that the course has been offered to Law School students in the past.
“As in previous years, this FAS elective is cross-listed at HLS so that law students may choose to enroll if they wish,” she wrote.
Law School spokesperson Melodie Jackson did not comment on further criticisms against the school.
Caton said students will ultimately be able to express their viewpoints by attending or avoiding the class.
“The upshot of that is that the students will decide by voting with their feet,” Caton said. “Both graduate and undergraduate students will decide whether or not they will attend those courses, and whether or not they feel comfortable being taught by him.”
Margaret G. Czerwienski, a Ph.D. candidate in Anthropology and a plaintiff in the lawsuit against Harvard for allegedly ignoring sexual harassment and retaliation by Comaroff, wrote in an email that students will “look to” Harvard’s handling of Comaroff’s allegations when weighing “the costs and benefits of speaking out.”
“We sacrificed years of our lives and suffered untold damage to our careers—all to help Harvard protect other students from suffering what we experienced and hold Professor Comaroff accountable,” she wrote. “Harvard’s decision to return Professor Comaroff to the very position of power Harvard found him to have abused, after mere months of sanction, reflects indifference to the human cost we paid.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts’ top court on Thursday partially revived a lawsuit filed by Tamara K. Lanier, who is suing Harvard over its possession of photographs she says depict her enslaved ancestors, ruling that Lanier has grounds to sue the school for emotional distress.

The state’s Supreme Judicial Court partially overturned a lower court decision throwing out the case. Citing Harvard’s response to Lanier’s attempts to obtain the photographs, the Court wrote Lanier’s allegations “plausibly support” her emotional distress claim.
In the decision, the Court ruled that Lanier’s allegations are sufficient grounds to pursue her original claim that Harvard negligently inflicted emotional distress, as well as the more severe civil charge of “reckless infliction of emotional distress.” The suit was dismissed by the Superior Court in March 2021, and Lanier’s attorneys since sought a second opinion from the Supreme Judicial Court.
“We are gratified by the Massachusetts Supreme Court’s historic ruling in Tamara Lanier’s case against Harvard University for the horrible exploitation of her Black ancestors, as this ruling will give Ms. Lanier her day in court to advocate for the memory of Renty,” Lanier and her attorneys, Benjamin L. Crump and Joshua D. Koskoff, said in a joint statement Thursday.
Both Crump and Koskoff have litigated cases that have drawn national headlines. Crump has represented the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Henrietta Lacks, as well as residents of Flint, Michigan, who were affected by the contaminated water in the city.
Koskoff previously represented the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary mass shooting in their successful lawsuit against Remington Arms — the manufacturer of the AR-15 — and represents families exploring legal action against gunmakers who manufactured the weapons used in the Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, mass shootings.
The Supreme Judicial Court’s decision does not, however, side with Lanier on all counts.
The justices affirmed the lower court’s dismissal of Lanier's claim that Harvard violated the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, as well as her property claims to photographs which according to the lawsuit depict her great-great-great-grandfather, Renty, and his daughter, Delia.
The case has been remanded to the Superior Court, which will review Lanier’s emotional distress claims in light of the decision by Massachusetts’ highest court.
“Harvard was put on notice that she would reasonably be greatly concerned about how the images — created through coercion and depicting her ancestors in a degrading, dehumanizing light — would be used, displayed, and disseminated,” the Supreme Judicial Court wrote. “Because, as alleged, Harvard did just the opposite, its actions plausibly rose to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct.”
The lawsuit, brought against the University in 2019, surrounds Harvard’s possession of daguerreotypes which are believed to be among the oldest existing photographs of enslaved people. The photographs were commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz for a research project based in polygenism — a racist pseudoscience that claims that some racial groups are genetically inferior — and are currently housed in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
A landmark report released in April by the Presidential Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery stated that Agassiz conducted “abusive ‘research’” that was “rooted in racial hierarchies of the sort marshalled by proponents of slavery.”
“In light of Harvard's complicity in the horrific actions surrounding the creation of the daguerreotypes, once Lanier communicated her understanding that the daguerreotypes depicted her ancestors and provided supporting documentation, we discern in both existing social values and customs and appropriate social policy a duty on Harvard's part to take reasonable care in responding to her,” the Court wrote.
The decision cites Harvard’s failure to inform Lanier that a photograph of Renty would be used on the cover of a book published by the University and in materials for a March 2017 conference on universities’ ties to slavery, as well as a statement by then-Peabody spokesperson Pamela Gerardi to Lanier’s local paper denying her ancestral ties to Renty.
“She’s given us nothing that directly connects her ancestor to the person in our photograph,” Gerardi said in a 2014 statement to the Norwich Bulletin. “She claims she has more evidence, but we haven’t seen it.”
According to the suit, Lanier contacted former University President Drew G. Faust in 2011, asking the University to formally review documentation connecting her to Renty and Delia, including United States Census records. In a written response, Faust wrote that Peabody staff would “be in touch” with Lanier on developments related to the daguerreotypes, though the Court notes Harvard failed to do so.
University spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the University is reviewing the decision, but declined to provide further comment.
The Supreme Judicial Court’s decision on the Lanier case comes three weeks after The Crimson published an article with details on a draft University report that stated Harvard holds the remains of 7,000 Native Americans and 19 individuals who were likely enslaved. The report acknowledged that the collections, held principally in the Peabody, represent “the University’s engagement and complicity” with slavery and colonialism.
The University’s April report from its Legacy of Slavery initiative provided historical research on Harvard’s entanglements with slavery and recommended the University take action to remedy the harm done.
“The damage caused by Harvard’s entanglements with slavery and its legacies warrant action,” the report reads. “Harvard should take responsibility for its past, and it should leverage its strengths in the pursuit of meaningful repair.”
In their joint statement Thursday, Lanier and her attorneys said they look forward to continuing the fight for Harvard to redress its treatment of Lanier and her ancestors.
“It is with great pride that we continue this legal and moral battle for justice against Harvard, as we look to repair the damage and degradation that they have caused Tamara Lanier, her ancestors, and all other people of color exploited by their institution,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is running out of helium — and it is no laughing matter.
A global helium shortage is affecting all sorts of consumers, ranging from the National Weather Service, to party-supply stores, to physicists at universities around the world.
Harvard’s own supply of helium is now reduced to only 50 percent of its usual amount, according to Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs.
“That has forced our experimental groups to greatly curtail the experiments that rely on that as a cryogenic liquid,” Stubbs said. “It impacts both elements of Harvard’s mission, both the research teaching and training element, as well as the research element.”
The current helium shortage is the fourth to occur since 2006 and is being caused by shutdowns at several major helium producers. The shortage has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, as Russia is one of the world’s top suppliers of helium.
Harvard labs impacted by the shortage have been forced to shut down equipment that uses liquid helium and suspend entire research projects. Without the ability to continue their experiments, some Ph.D. candidates could even have their graduation delayed.
“My heart goes out to the people whose careers might be adversely impacted,” Stubbs said.
“There are other instances where people’s work in the field is impacted by natural disasters, by international events, and the like,” Stubbs added. “Some of those things are just unpredictable and unavoidable.”
As a result of the recurring shortages, Harvard is looking to reduce its dependency on helium over time.
“We are actively in the process of crafting a plan to wean ourselves from liquid helium in the long run,” Stubbs said.
But according to Andrew T. Pierce, who finished his Ph.D. in physics at Harvard this year, liquid helium is still “the lifeblood of low-temperature physics.”
While new systems that produce very low temperatures without needing a constant supply of liquid helium have been developed, those systems are not suitable for all experiments.
“In particular, they tend to produce rather severe vibrations,” Pierce said. “And so very sensitive applications — like microscopy — that require very low vibration, are so far still very difficult to do with these cryogen-free systems.”
“The helium shortage is a blow, really, to lots of low-temperature physics groups that are doing these kinds of more sensitive experiments,” he added.
Charlotte G. L. Bøttcher, who works in Physics Professor Amir Yacoby’s lab, said the helium shortage forced some graduate students to chart a completely different course for their Ph.D. “from one day to the other.”
Bøttcher called herself “lucky” because she recently finished her Ph.D. and has not been affected too severely by the helium shortage, but said it was “hard” to watch some of her colleagues whose experiments were “producing really nice results” face consequences from not having enough helium.
“Over the last year or so, they produced the dominant amount of papers and results from the lab,” Bøttcher said. “And [now] we just couldn’t run that system anymore.”
Zhuozhen Cai, a first-year graduate student in the Yacoby Lab, was one of the Ph.D. candidates whose plans were severely disrupted by the reduced supply of helium.
Cai said it was “pretty depressing” when she realized the helium shortage would prevent her from continuing the project she had spent the previous year training to work on, adding that her now suspended project influenced her decision to join the Yacoby Lab in the first place.
“My future right now is not clear anymore,” Cai said.
Cai added she is troubled the most by the uncertainty surrounding whether more helium will be available soon, allowing her original project to resume, or whether the shortage will drag on, forcing her to completely abandon her work.
“What’s the possibility that the helium is going to come back in like a couple of months?” Cai asked. “Or what’s the possibility that we’re just going to give up this setup forever?”
“I think that is the most scary part,” she said.
Pierce, who helped train Cai before the shortage, said they were using “a really old system” that relied on liquid helium because it was “very vibration sensitive.”
“Now with the liquid helium being available in reduced supply, we’re not able to run that system for the time being,” he said. “We’re not the only ones who are kind of in that boat.”
Pierce said Harvard researchers are lucky to have even a reduced supply of helium.
“I have heard that there are some groups and universities that currently cannot get any liquid helium at all,” he said. “As always, we’re really the beneficiaries of Harvard and the vast resources that are available to Harvard.”
In fact, Harvard is more shielded from the helium shortage than other universities.
Stubbs explained that Harvard has a system that is able to recycle and recirculate some of the helium used at its labs.
“Unlike many other campuses, we actually have a liquid helium recovery system that actually recovers the boil off, returns it to a facility with a compressor, and reliquefies it,” Stubbs said.
Even so, Pierce said the current shortage is the “worst one” of his career.
“It’s not the first helium shortage that’s occurred since I’ve been here,” he added, “but it’s certainly the most severe.”
