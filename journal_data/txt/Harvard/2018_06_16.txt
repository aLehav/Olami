After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Do women have to be naked to get into the Met?” asks the most iconic of 30 posters by the Guerilla Girls. In 1989, the anonymous feminist collective surveyed the ratio of female to male nudes showcased in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and compared it to the ratio of female to male artists whose art hung on the walls of the Met galleries. The results? “Less than five percent of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women, but 85 percent of the nudes are female,” the poster reports—data that has admittedly shifted, but only incrementally, over the past few decades.
The women who prowl the halls of the Met in Gary Ross’s “Ocean’s 8” are less preoccupied with the artwork on the walls, and more with the Hollywood royalty on display at the annual Met Gala, an event one character aptly terms “the most exclusive party in the world.” Their ambitions are decidedly more artful than artistic, though a similar reclamation of power is at work here, too. After Debby Ocean (Sandra Bullock), sister of George Clooney’s Danny Ocean of the original Ocean’s franchise, talks her way out of jail, her first move is to slip effortlessly back into her material life, first by swindling cosmetics from a Bergdorf saleswoman, then by hustling a luxury suite at a New York hotel, the first of many steps to her elaborate plan to pull a complicated jewelry heist during the Met Gala. Debby’s star-studded squad includes her wisecracking former partner in crime, Lou Miller (Cate Blanchett, in an array of various leopard-print and glittery costumes), along with five other heist specialists (including, but not limited to, Mindy Kaling as Amita, an expert jeweler, Sarah Paulson as a stay-at-home mommy whose restlessness leads to truck hijacking, and Rihanna as a professional hacker). Together, Debby’s team works to plant Cartier’s $150 million Toussaint diamond necklace on Daphne Kluger (a scowling Anne Hathaway, who’s more Miranda Priestly than Andy), a snotty Hollywood starlet.
Gary Ross’s all-female spin-off of Steven Soderbergh’s 2001 original buzzes with a unique energy of its own. It’s a joy to watch these actresses work, like a feminist buddy comedy dream-casted by Twitter fandom. They all banter cleverly, exchanging one-liners. “Honey, is this a proposal?” Lou quips, to which Debby deadpans, “Baby, I don’t have a diamond yet.” Cast members have been known to gush about the affectionate on-set atmosphere in press junket interviews, a comfort that manifests clearly in their characters’ easy rapport. It makes the heist itself moot—whether or not they succeed is of little consequence when we’re just here for the witty repartee. Or as Amita complains in one scene, “Can’t we just go? Do we have to steal stuff?”
Amita has a point. A sensible director might have cut “Ocean's 8” off 20 minutes early. But Ross drags out the film’s third act until its energy fizzles out, using James Corden as an insurance investigator in a half-baked attempt to reinvigorate a plot sorely lacking in conflict, as if the director suddenly realized that it might be implausible for his characters to simply get away with the crime. Of course it isn’t plausible. Neither is the conceit of the film itself, from the scheme to 3D-scan a necklace and remotely print a zirconium model, to the act of hauling up the necklace from the Cartier vault to begin with. Ross ought to know that the most compelling caper isn’t whether Debby and Co. get found out, or even how they pull it off, but why they choose to do it—and what it means for the impenetrably deified upper social strata.
Following recent fascination for individuals on the margin who can talk their way into elite circles on the seat of their pants, “Ocean’s 8” is a film of its time—one whose currency is beauty, wealth, and above all, status. A Met Gala camera shot lingers purposefully on the Kardashians, America’s de-facto royal family, whose fame is the go-to symbol of ersatz class and rich-quick wealth generated seemingly out of thin air. Who’s in and who’s out has never been more glaringly apparent, and “Ocean’s 8” does best when it speculates how much of “being in” is performative: how easy it is to infiltrate the Met Gala unnoticed or to talk Cartier out of its crown jewels, all the while undermining the cartoonishly ostentatious institutions themselves. (It should be noted that it takes a little more than sleight of hand for A-listers to believably pose as outsiders. Bullock, Blanchett, and Bonham Carter—it’d be a shocker if those household names weren’t already on the invite list.)
It’s a shame that any all-female cast film has to be a capital-S Statement—on female-driven narratives, on women being funny or serious enough, on whether they can make it big at the box office (which “Ocean's 8” has done superbly, but this is besides the point). Films can suffocate under the weight of insurmountable expectations (the 2016 “Ghostbusters” reboot, widely considered a box office bomb, comes to mind), and frustratingly, each victory or failure is heavily symbolic. A victory is an outlier, a failure is evidence that women can’t head mainstream films without being relegated to another genre like “chick flick.” Surely it was never a talking point whether 1984’s “Ghostbusters” or 2001’s “Ocean’s Eleven” would be enough to sustain the future of male-driven movies.
When it comes to “Ocean’s 8,” it’s a promising gesture toward more of its kind, but as a film in itself, it struggles to ascend beyond blockbuster fodder that’s only semi-witty. It’s a 3D-printed zirconium model of what it could have been: Exciting, but just not the real thing. Although perhaps the most telling part of “Ocean’s 8” is not the heist, but its metaphorical subtext. Women want a seat at the table, even if it means breaking in uninvited.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions accused Harvard admissions officers of assigning discriminatory “personal” ratings to Asian-American applicants and attempting to “racially engineer” incoming classes, according to briefings filed in federal court Friday morning.
The briefings marks the latest development in the ongoing lawsuit against Harvard which SFFA first brought in Nov. 2014,
Using statistical analysis and opinions from outside experts—as well as newly public (though heavily redacted) accounts of Harvard’s highly competitive admissions process—SFFA reported that College admissions officers consistently scored Asian-American applicants lower than applicants of other races on “personal traits” like “positive personality,” “likability,” “kindness,” and “humor.”
The personal traits rating is one of several factors the Admissions Office considers when making admissions decisions, according to the court filings. Harvard admissions officers numerically rank applicants for their personal traits on a scale of 1 to 6—1 being the highest, and 6 the lowest.
SFFA filings note that Asian-American applicants to Harvard typically score higher than do applicants of any other race on other factors considered in the admissions process—factors including academics, extracurriculars, and recommendations from teachers and college counselors.
“No rational factfinder could conclude that Harvard’s admissions system complies with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act,” SFFA argued in its briefing. Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, among other qualities.
Lawyers for the University, in a filing submitted later Friday morning, rejected the notion that any differences in scoring constituted discrimination.
“Nothing in the record suggests any effort by Harvard to limit the number of Asian-American students, which fluctuates considerably from year to year,” Harvard's filing reads.
SFFA also accused Harvard of setting an artificial floor for the admission rate of African-American applicants.
A heavily redacted portion of the briefing further alleges Harvard performs “racial balancing”—that the College works to ensure particular racial groups compose predetermined percentages of the student body.  SFFA pointed to the racial demographics of incoming classes, which have remained consistent across the past several years.
Moreover, SFFA argued, the admit rate for African Americans in the years studied closely tracked that of the overall applicant pool—to the tenth of one percent for the College’s admitted Classes of 2017 through 2019.
“The chance of this match occurring in three consecutive years (without direct manipulation) is less than two-tenths of one percent—making it a near certainty that Harvard was purposely setting a floor on the admission rate of those applicants,” SFFA's briefing reads.
Lawyers for Harvard disagreed.
“The extensive record compiled in this case would not permit a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that Harvard pursues quotas, seeks proportional racial representation, or engages in racial balancing,” Harvard’s filing reads. “In particular, no evidence suggests that Harvard seeks to limit representation of any racial group on campus.”
The accusations come in addition to SFFA's charge that Harvard ignored the results of a 2013 internal investigation that found Asian Americans suffered "negative effects" in the College's admissions process. As part of that investigation, Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research concluded in one report that “Asian high achievers have lower rates of admission.”
Harvard disputes the overall validity of the internal analysis as SFFA interprets it.
“Thorough and comprehensive analysis of the data and evidence makes clear that Harvard College does not discriminate against applicants from any group, including Asian-Americans, whose rate of admission has grown 29% over the last decade,” University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven, wrote in an email.
“Mr. Blum and his organization’s incomplete and misleading data analysis paint a dangerously inaccurate picture of Harvard College’s whole-person admissions process by omitting critical data and information factors, such as personal essays and teacher recommendations, that directly counter his arguments,” she wrote.
SFFA argued the evidence in its favor is so compelling the case does not even require a trial. Harvard argued the opposite—that the case should be decided in the University’s favor without a trial. If neither party is successful in convincing the judge to dismiss the case, the lawsuit will likely go to trial in fall 2018, at which point thousands of more pages of Harvard admissions data will become public.
SFFA's arguments draw heavily from research it attributes to Duke Professor of Economics Peter S. Arcidiacono. According to SFFA filings, Arcidiacono’s research found Asian Americans, while outperforming other racial groups in “many objective measures,” receive disproportionately low scores from Harvard officials on measures of “subjective” personal qualities.
“When it comes to the score assigned by the Admissions Office, Asian-American applicants are assigned the lowest scores of any racial group,” the organization’s lawyers wrote. “By contrast, alumni interviewers (who actually meet the applicants) rate Asian Americans, on average, at the top with respect to personal ratings—comparable to white applicants and higher than African-American and Hispanic applicants.”
Arcidiacono’s statistical models conclude that “Asian Americans are penalized in selection for admission” because of their race, according to SFFA filings.
The expert for Harvard, Professor of Economics David E. Card of the University of California, Berkeley, came to a radically different conclusion by employing a model that considers other factors—like legacy status or athletic recruitment—that Arcidiacono excluded from his models.
Card found that, “to be admitted to Harvard, applicants must have multiple areas of strength, and race is not a determinative factor.”
Harvard dismisses the idea that its admissions process is discriminatory.
“Harvard will continue to vigorously defend our right, and that of other colleges and universities nationwide, to seek the educational benefits that come from a class that is diverse on multiple dimensions, from its capacity for academic excellence to its ability to help create a campus community that gives every student the opportunity to learn from peers with a wide variety of academic interests, perspectives, and talents,” Cowenhoven wrote in a statement.
Friday’s filing deadline commences what is known as the summary judgement phase of the lawsuit, during which the court will review arguments from each legal team and decide whether to dismiss all or parts of the case. Experts—and Judge Burroughs herself—have suggested such an outcome is unlikely. Amicus briefings in favor of summary judgement must be filed by July 30, and those opposed must be submitted a month later.
If the case is not dismissed, a trial will commence Oct. 15 and proceed over the course of roughly three weeks in the U.S. District Court in Boston.
SFFA and Harvard filed their motions for summary judgment Friday alongside several hundred pages of expert deposition.

Physics and Astronomy professor Christopher W. Stubbs will assume the role of interim dean of science in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on July 1, according to an email sent by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith to faculty on Thursday.
Stubbs will be the second ever administrator in the role. His predecessor, Geophysics professor Jeremy Bloxham, became the inaugural holder of the position in 2007. Bloxham announced in March that he would end his eleven-year tenure at the conclusion of the 2017-2018 academic year.
“In this role, Professor Stubbs will have principal responsibility for all academic, financial, and space planning across the Science Division, working in partnership with the departments and centers,” Smith wrote in his email. “He will also serve as a member of the Academic Planning Group, the academic senior leadership team that advises the FAS Dean on a broad range of policy and resource issues.”
Stubbs joined the Faculty in 2003 as a professor of Physics and Astronomy. He previously served as the chair of the Physics department and was named a Harvard College Professor in 2009—an honor bestowed upon members of the Faculty in recognition of excellence in their roles as educators. As a physicist, Stubbs was a member of one of the two teams that first discovered dark energy, and also founded the APOLLO collaboration that probes for novel gravitational effects.
Since accepting the position, Stubbs said he has met with numerous colleagues, including Bloxham and others who work in the office of the Dean of Science.
“We're in the process of doing assessments and making priorities and crafting plans,” Stubbs said. “I think this transition is smoothly underway.”
Stubbs said he believes the challenges the sciences division faces include maintaining ties with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences as SEAS expands into Allston, continuing previous initiatives started by Bloxham and Smith, and upholding the General Education requirements.
“I think we need to step up and support the General Education revisions we've undertaken and offer a suite of courses that meet the needs of our students,” he said.
Stubbs will assume the role as president-elect Lawrence S. Bacow continues the search for the next dean of FAS. Smith announced in March he would be stepping down as FAS dean once Bacow chooses his successor.
Stubbs will likely serve as dean of science only until the next FAS dean appoints a permanent divisional dean, though he said he does not intend to lead a “caretaker administration.”
“I think with these interim positions, one alternative is to just sort of sit tight and do minimal things and bide your time until a successor is appointed, and another approach is to seize the window of opportunity and try to effect change,” Stubbs said. “I certainly intend to do the latter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s newly formed graduate student union launched its bargaining survey Wednesday evening, marking the first step in the union’s preparations to negotiate with the University.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers bargaining committee, a 13-member group elected last month, has been drafting the survey since the committee’s formation in April. The committee will use the results of the survey to draw up a list of priorities as it prepares to head to the bargaining table.
Several issues highlighted in the survey figured into pro-union arguments in the run-up to the April election where teaching and research assistants voted to unionize.
In March 2017, when administrators announced lower-than-usual increases to Ph.D. stipends—coupled with rent increases in University housing—union organizers argued collective bargaining would provide students a formal channel to advocate for affordable housing.
The eight-part online survey also asks members of the bargaining unit to rate the importance of protection for international students and undocumented immigrants, establishing housing and childcare subsidies, providing free dental and vision insurance, and approximately 45 other potential bargaining goals.
Eleven days after the result of the April election was announced, University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced Harvard’s intention to bargain in good faith with HGSU-UAW, allowing the union to move forward with preparations—electing the bargaining committee to develop the survey.
Sociology Ph.D. candidate Mo Torres wrote in an email he thought the survey was comprehensive.
“There were a number of items on the survey I hadn't previously considered, which is a testament to the legwork the bargaining committee has done,” he wrote. “There was a section on the needs of international students, for instance. As a non-international student, I don't know that I would have been able to identify all the different and important ways the international student experience at Harvard could be improved.”
Torres added he hopes the committee can negotiate for improvements to graduate funding packages and health benefits.
In another section of the survey, respondents are asked to indicate whether they have witnessed hostility towards specific groups in the workplace, including women, people of color, BGLTQ people and gender-nonconforming people, people with disabilities, and international students.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Ph.D. student Alyssa M. Hernandez wrote in an email that she “very much appreciated” questions on the survey that addressed these groups.
“I was especially happy to see the bargaining goal questions dedicated to equity and inclusion,” Hernandez wrote. “As one of the GSAS diversity fellows, I really want to address issues that may arise for underrepresented groups at Harvard.”
HGSU-UAW has not set a cutoff for how many of the approximately 5,000 eligible students must fill out the survey before they begin negotiations. The University of Connecticut’s graduate student union—which is also affiliated with the United Automobile Workers—ensured over half of members completed the questions before negotiating, UConn union organizer Steven Manicastri said in April.
“We encourage wide participation so that all student workers have the opportunity to help shape our bargaining goals,” bargaining committee member Madeleine F. Jennewein wrote in an emailed statement Friday.
Bargaining unit members must vote to approve these goals before HGSU-UAW can begin making formal contract proposals to the University, Jennewein wrote.
“This survey feedback will help us develop initial bargaining goals that aim to reflect the diverse needs of the Harvard student worker community,” she wrote.

Vegan enthusiasts at the College will return to campus this year to a new hangout in the Square—Veggie Grill. The restaurant, slated to open in the fall at 57 John F. Kennedy St., will offer vegan burgers, bowls, burritos, and salads.
Veggie Grill, founded in 2006, currently operates 30 locations, mostly on the West Coast. Chief Executive Officer Steve Heeley wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that it seemed like a logical next step to introduce the restaurant to the East Coast.
“We’re thrilled to be joining the Cambridge community and providing Bostonians with a new plant-based option to satisfy their need for a convenient and delicious meal,” he wrote.
Heeley wrote the menu at Veggie Grill’s Cambridge location will not feature any differences. He anticipates more digital orders because of the “busy lifestyles” of local students and residents.
Heeley wrote Veggie Grill was “thrilled” to join the Cambridge community.
“Cambridge offers a unique collegiate community and we look forward to welcoming Harvard students and faculty, campus organizations, sports teams and more,” Heeley wrote. “We believe there are many people in the Cambridge and Harvard communities who believe in our purpose – Better for you. Better for the planet.”
Remedy Ryan ’21 said though she can rely on vegan options at most places in Cambridge, including Clover, Pinocchios, and Spice, she looks forward to being able to go to a fully vegan restaurant.
“I’m definitely going to go to Veggie Grill a ton,” Ryan said. “I love supporting vegan restaurants. I think veganism is great for animals and the environment, and I hope more Harvard students will try it out because it’ll be right there.”
Heeley wrote Veggie Grill is currently in the negotiation stage to hopefully open three or four more locations in Boston over the next couple of years.

Harvard admissions officers assign numerical scores from 1 to 6 to each College applicant they consider and use those scores to determine Harvard hopefuls' fates, according to court filings submitted Friday.
The filings—part of a lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process—reveal previously unknown details of the University’s secretive admissions process. Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions first filed the lawsuit against Harvard in 2014.
In Oct. 2016, Harvard provided SFFA with data on hundreds of thousands of students who applied to the College between fall 2009 and spring 2015. In addition to drawing on this data, SFFA's Friday filing also references statistical analysis and opinions given by outside experts.
Harvard applicants are assigned ratings in approximately 14 categories including academic achievement, extracurricular involvement, athletic prowess, strength of character, up to four teacher recommendations, counselor recommendations, a “personal” and “overall” rating by staff, and a “personal” and “overall” rating by an alumnus, according to the documents filed by SFFA.
The ratings range from 1 to 6, with 1 marking the highest possible score. Admissions officers can also add a “+” or “-” to a score to distinguish stronger candidates from weaker ones. As an example, a briefing submitted by SFFA indicates that a “2+” rating is stronger than a “2,” which is in turn stronger than a “2-” rating.
“Those who have an overall score of 3- or worse are almost always rejected,” Duke Professor of Economics Peter S. Arcidiacono, who analyzed several years’ worth of admissions data, wrote in a briefing submitted by SFFA. “In contrast, those who receive an overall rating of a 1 are always accepted (in both datasets).”
Federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who is overseeing the case, redacted a portion of the SFFA documents that included Harvard-provided information regarding what typically happens to applicants who receive an overall rating of 1 or 2 or a score of 3 or lower.
The filings also detail guidelines for admissions officers—called “Reading Procedures”—that outline criteria applicants must meet to receive certain scores. Burroughs redacted most of the information on the “Reading Procedures” in the court documents, but a few pieces of information remained visible.
The Harvard documents report that an applicant who receives a “1” academic rating usually “has submitted academic work of some kind that is reviewed by a faculty member,” while a candidate with a “2+” academic rating typically has “perfect, or near-perfect, grades and testing, but no evidence of substantial scholarship or academic creativity.”
A College hopeful who gets a “2” extracurricular rating typically has “significant school, and possibly regional accomplishments”—for example, an applicant who was “student body president or captain of the debate team and the leader of multiple additional clubs.”
Burroughs redacted information about what constitutes an extracurricular score of “1,” as well as most of the information about “1” scores in different categories.
The SFFA documents also provide insight into how admissions officers score the personal component of an applicant's rating. The documents assert readers first arrive at a student’s personal score by “examining a variety of ‘subjective’ factors,” including applicants’ “character traits” and whether they have a “positive personality.”
Harvard’s filing states that admissions officers review candidates’ “humor, sensitivity, grit, leadership, integrity, helpfulness, courage, kindness and many other qualities” when determining the personal rating.
A “1” score denotes “outstanding” personal skills; “2” denotes “very strong” skills; “3” denotes “generally positive” skills; “4” means a candidate is “bland or somewhat negative or immature”; “5” means the candidate possesses "questionable personal qualities”; and “6” points to “worrisome personal qualities.”
If an applicant participates in an interview, the interviewer—typically either an alumnus or an admissions officer—also assigns the candidate a "personal" and "overall" score. In making their final determination, Harvard admissions officers also review these separate scores, according to the filings.
Although interviews are not required, “those who do not interview are rarely admitted,” according to the SFFA filing.
After scoring applicants across all these categories, admissions officers assign students an “overall” score, per the filings. The final score is not simply a composite of applicants’ other ratings; admissions personnel are instructed to arrive at this score by “stepping back and taking all the factors into account.”
The rating system comprises part of the first phase of the admissions process, per the SFFA filings. After the first reader combs through an application, a “small group of admissions officers” reaches a “tentative decision” about whether to accept, waitlist, or reject an application. Next, the full Admissions Committee—comprising nearly 40 members—convenes to “reach final decisions on applicants,” according to the University’s submission.
Throughout this process, senior admissions officials review reports on applicants’ demographic data at “critical points,” including “at the close of the early-action and regular-decision cycles,” SFFA’s filing states. These documents, termed “one-pagers” track factors including the gender, location, legacy status, disadvantaged status, recruited athlete status, citizenship, and race of College hopefuls.
Senior admissions staff—including Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 and Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70—review these documents “throughout” the full Admissions Committee meetings, per the SFFA document.
Even as some previously unknown information about Harvard’s admissions process became public in Friday’s filings, the vast majority of admissions data will remain confidential unless the lawsuit goes to trial.
Both Harvard and SFFA hope to convince the judge to throw out the case before it goes to trial, though experts—and Burroughs herself—have said this outcome is unlikely.

With slow foot traffic amid a gentle drizzle of rain, Amorino—a “boutique” gelato shop—quietly opened its doors in Harvard Square earlier this week.
The high-end dessert establishment is the second Amorino site in the greater Boston area, joined by a location on Newbury Street that opened in 2015.
Léa Sasportes, the executive developer for Amorino in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, said in an interview in late May she had sought to open a Harvard Square location since before the Newbury location opened, noting the chain’s popularity among students and tourists.
“People love taking pictures and sharing them on social media,” she said.
The store’s popularity derives in part from the flower-shaped designs it shapes its gelato into. Amorino also allows customers to top off desserts with gelato-filled macarons, according to Sasportes.
Hyeon-Jae Seo ’20, who said she had walked by the store’s location many times prior to its opening, visited on the first day, sitting behind the main room in the shop’s seating area.
“I really like the interior here,” Seo said. “It’s a nice place to hang out.”
Amorino is the first gelato shop in the Square, though it joins several popular ice cream locations, including Ben and Jerry’s and J.P. Licks.
Adriano Borsa ’20, who also visited the store on its opening day and ordered the pistachio and hazelnut flavors, said the opening of the shop presented him with more choices for frozen treats.
“I thought the quality of the ice cream was really good,” Borsa said. “It’s basically like, do I go here or or do I go to BerryLine?”
“A new dilemma,” he said.
