After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget T. Long enters her fifth year in the post, her top priorities are ensuring the financial health of the school and a successful rollout of its five newly redesigned masters programs, Long said in an interview Friday.
HGSE received the largest donation in its history from two Harvard Business School alumni this spring. The alumni donated $30 million directly to HGSE and pledged to match up to $10 million in additional contributions to support scholarships for Teaching and Teacher Leadership, one of the new master's programs at the school.
“They come to us because of their commitment and interest in education very specifically,” Long said of the Business School donors. “While they wanted to stay anonymous, they did want to put out the signal to other Business School alumni.”
Long said she wants to prioritize financial aid.
“We saw some success last year not only with the large gift for the teacher education program to the Teaching and Teacher Leadership – TTL – but financial aid more generally for our master's students,” she said.
Interest in all five of HGSE’s new master's programs has increased, Long added, with more undergraduates and mid-career professionals applying.
“We changed the way we organize the programs,” she said. “Typically [in] higher education, we’re so used to being organized by our disciplines – economics, sociology, psychology – but we reorganized the program to be really focused on the roles that people go into in education, whether that’s leadership or policy or human development, learning design, or teaching.”
Going forward, Long said HGSE is “in constant conversations with our students about their courses” to successfully execute the redesigns.
HGSE also welcomed the first class of its online master's program in education leadership this fall. The virtual program drew a more diverse group of students than other programs, Long said, citing the class’s greater representation of students from the Midwest and the South.
“There's a real richness of the student body that you can put together when you don't have the requirement that you have to leave where you live, so we're really taking advantage of that,” she said.
Long said that the online master's cohort targets students who are typically older and already have master's degrees or “other advanced training.”
“They're not looking to come back and have that campus experience,” Long said.
She added that some HGSE students are in favor of more extensive online course offerings.
“Given the experience that so many students had during Covid, even our residential students have expressed interest in taking some of their courses online,” Long said.
In an interview with The Crimson in 2018, Long said hoped to expand HGSE’s impact locally and globally. She said on Friday that HGSE can serve as a “facilitator” of knowledge for educators, citing the shift to remote learning during the pandemic.
“There was a concerted effort to share what we were developing for ourselves and for our students with a broader field,” Long said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College held its annual Midyear Graduates Celebration Friday afternoon, honoring more than 170 seniors who are graduating off-cycle.
The celebration recognized November and March degree candidates who finished their coursework over the summer and this term, respectively. Hosted in a Science Center lecture hall, seniors — some clad in graduation garb, others in jeans — gathered with family and friends for the ceremony.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Harvard College saw an uptick in students who opted to take time off, resulting in a higher number of off-cycle graduates. Roughly 240 seniors graduated off-cycle last year, compared to about 130 in 2020 and around 115 in 2019, according to Harvard spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana — himself an off-cycle graduate of Cornell — called on seniors to embrace “serendipity” in their lives in an address during the ceremony.
“As December graduates, you’ve already departed from the script you were following when you arrived here,” Khurana said. “You have had the chance to shape Harvard in uncharted ways through discovery and unexpected decisions. And in doing so, you’ve had to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.”
Philip W. Lovejoy, the outgoing executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association, encouraged the new graduates to connect with alumni and “steward the university into the future.”
Scott V. Edwards ’86, chair and professor in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and director of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ graduate studies, encouraged seniors to travel and “remain broad and active” in their interests.
In his address, Edwards recalled biking across the country to raise awareness for Black Lives Matter during the summer of 2020.
“On that trip, I really learned — and continued to practice — simply listening to people, hearing them, giving them their space, empathizing, figuring out what’s important to them,” Edwards said. “Hopefully, that’s a skill that your Harvard education has helped you to refine and apply in diverse settings.”
Kate H. Travis ’22, a March degree candidate who took time off during the pandemic, said she enjoyed the ceremony, though it differed from the pomp and circumstance of the University’s Commencement in May.
“It’s definitely not the same as the real graduation ceremony,” Travis said. “But I was glad that they had it, and it was good to hear the stories of people that have also taken time off.”
Hayato Shiotsu ’22 said he appreciated the gap semester he took due to setbacks caused by Covid but was “ready to head out.”
“It was nice that they talked about the benefits of straying off the set path,” Shiotsu said. “I hope that's something we can keep doing.”
In her address, 2022 Class Committee Secretary Alicia Vernell Rivera ’22 described students’ reasons for taking time away from classes as “beautiful, unselfish, generous, and exciting.”
“Whatever leaps you made during that time off have contributed to the version of you sitting here today,” Rivera said. “You learn even more from being away from Harvard, coming back to it with a new set of eyes and appreciation for it by adding to your own personal interpretive horizon.”
The ceremony was moderated by Class of 2023 Second Marshal Chibuike K. “Chibby” Uwakwe ’23 and Class Secretary Kelsey J. Griffin ’23 — both Crimson editors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Association convened for its final general meeting of the fall semester Sunday, allocating nearly $17,000 in grants for social, academic, and professional development initiatives.
With the Association’s inaugural semester drawing to a close, the body also outlined plans for an “organizational review,” which could see the creation of an “Inclusion Team” and an expanded “Co-Treasurer” position.
The working group, which will convene over winter recess, will propose structural and procedural recommendations to the HUA executive team. Any changes to the HUA’s constitution would require approval via a College-wide referendum.
During the meeting, HUA leaders confirmed this spring’s referendum may include a question on the creation of the “Inclusion Team,” a move that comes after the body drew criticism from Harvard Primus, a campus group for first-generation, low-income students, early in the semester.
In September, Primus leaders alleged the student government rejected the group’s efforts to establish an HUA diversity, equity, and inclusion team, a charge the HUA deemed “misinformation.”
With $47,493.74 remaining in its total fall semester budget, the Association moved to approve two costly initiatives Sunday.
Citing a need for accessible professional clothing on campus, HUA Co-Presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24 introduced a “Professional Clothing Closet” initiative, which would allow Harvard students to borrow formal wear for professional development purposes, free of charge.
Estabine and Johnson said the project would source its inventory from a combination of donations from Harvard affiliates and purchases made by the Association. Students would not have to demonstrate financial need to use the closet.
Voting Sunday, the Association unanimously approved a $10,000 allocation to fund the project, which is set to begin operation in early February.
The Association also approved a $6,456 grant from its Social Life Team budget to Harvard Datamatch, a service that matches Harvard students with 10 potential love interests or friends via an algorithm based on responses to an online survey. The grant will go toward the service’s technical costs and meal subsidies for matched students.
Harvard Datamatch Co-Presidents Alexander V. Cheng ’24 and Chelsea E. Guo ’24 said they requested the money in part due to the rising cost of food in Harvard Square. Additionally, the funding will allow participants to go on subsidized dates with all 10 of their matches, rather than just the top matches as in years past.
Thirteen students, including Guo and Cheng, voted in favor of the grant. Two voted “unopposed.”
At Sunday’s meeting, HUA Finance Officer Alexander J. Zurovec ’25 also presented a brief summary of fall semester funding.
According to the presentation, which rounded figures to the nearest dollar amount, 254 student organizations submitted $682,175 in eligible funding requests, $225,503 of which was ultimately approved by the HUA.
Zurovec said he hopes to improve clarity for club leaders around what costs are eligible for HUA funding and solicit feedback on the disbursement process via a survey form.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1978, Henry Rosovsky was on a mission. Then the dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences and an economics professor, Rosovsky wanted to revolutionize the way Harvard taught its undergraduates. He drove the creation of the College’s Core Curriculum and the modern-day Department of African and African American Studies. Determined to see this transformation through, Rosovsky even rejected offers to become the president of Yale University and the University of Chicago.
Rosovsky, who served as the dean of the FAS from 1973 to 1984, died on Nov. 11 in his home in Cambridge.
He joined Harvard as a professor of economics from 1965 to 1996, became acting University President in 1984 and 1987, and served on the Harvard Corporation in 1984. As the first Jewish dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Rosovsky founded Harvard's Center for Jewish Studies in 1978. Harvard Hillel named its building Rosovsky Hall in his honor in 1994.
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow described Rosovsky as “one of the foremost figures in academia.”
“An exceptional scholar of Japan and its economy, he was deeply respected by faculty and colleagues, and he had a unique perspective on Harvard, serving as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, as a member of the Harvard Corporation, and as acting president,” Bacow told the Harvard Gazette, a University publication.
“His legacy continues to influence the experience of every person on our campus today,” Bacow added.
Rosovsky is survived by his wife Nitza Rosovsky, former curator of the Harvard Semitic Museum; three children Leah, Judy, Michael; four grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.
Professor Edward Glaeser, chair of the Economics Department, described Rosovksy’s most important legacy at Harvard as “his passion for making Harvard the best university in the world.”
Rosovsky was born in 1927 in the German city-state of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland). When Nazi Germany planned to seize the city, he fled with his family to several countries across Europe, eventually moving to New York in 1940.
After serving in the Counterintelligence Corps during the Nuremberg war crime trials, he attended the College of William & Mary. He later received a Purple Heart for his service in the Korean War from 1950 to 1952.
After earning his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1959, Rosovsky taught at the University of California at Berkeley — as well as at Stanford University, Hitotsubashi and Tokyo Universities in Japan, and Hebrew University in Jerusalem — before joining Harvard in 1965.
Six days after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in April 1968, The Crimson ran an advertisement from the Harvard-Radcliffe Association for African and Afro-American Students.
“Do you mourn Martin Luther King? Harvard can do this,” the ad stated.
It listed four demands: an endowed chair for a Black professor, courses related to Black students, more Black faculty, and more Black representation among Harvard students.
The advertisement sparked a movement for a Black studies department. In January 1969, Rosovsky, then only an economics professor, headed a committee that recommended Harvard establish such a program, as well as an Afro-American Cultural Center. Three months later, he resigned from the panel, protesting the other faculty panel members’ decision to give Black students a vote in choosing faculty.
Rosovsky’s committee also drew backlash from students who felt the recommendation for a “program” rather than a department devalued Black studies. Within the month, the faculty committee decided to designate Afro-American Studies as a department.
More than 20 years later in 1991, Rosovsky recruited professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. as the chair of the Afro-American Studies department.
Gates, director of Hutchins Center for African American Research, wrote in an emailed statement that Rosovsky sought to balance “being in the world and reflecting the world in the university” in a responsible way.
“To that end, he was one of the first administrators to see African American Studies not as ethnic window-dressing, but as a bold and innovative addition to the core mission of a liberal arts university, a long-suppressed body of knowledge that would enrich our understanding of the humanities, the arts, and the social sciences,” he wrote.
“The success of Harvard’s department in this field can be traced to Henry’s vision and his commitment of the resources necessary to implement that vision,” Gates added.
In the 1970s, the College’s General Education requirements included three basic fields – social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences. Under Rosovsky’s leadership, the FAS approved the establishment of the Core Curriculum in May 1978. The Core Curriculum encompassed requirements in five academic areas: literature and the arts, history, social and philosophical analysis, science and mathematics, and foreign languages and culture.
“There’s no question that the introduction of the Core Curriculum, which was visionary in its time, was, in some sense, the crowning glory of his time period,” Glaeser said.
For 25 years, the Core Curriculum served as the “cornerstone” of a Harvard College education. To increase academic flexibility, in 2007, the FAS abolished the Core in favor of a General Education system that required students take courses in eight categories. In 2019, the College debuted the current Gen Ed system, which reduced the required Gen Ed courses by half and added three new required courses in Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Sciences or Engineering and Applied Sciences.
In addition to researching on the Japanese economy, pioneering Jewish studies, and advocating for African American studies, Rosovsky served as a consultant for the United States government, the World Bank, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the Asian Development Bank.
“Henry was a true scholar, but also very much a man of the world,” Glaeser said. “Henry was someone whose values aligned perfectly with the values I think we all should aspire for: values that relate to moving knowledge forward and having an undergraduate program that is ideally the best in the world.”
Leah Rosovsky ’78, the director of the Boston Athenæum and one of Henry Rosovsky’s daughters, said her father had a clear vision for the place of higher education in the world.
“My father thought that higher education was really the most important thing that a society did, and he felt that it was a way to change the world,” Leah Rosovosky said.
Glaeser described Rosovsky as “charming,” “gracious,” and most importantly, “wise.”
“He was effective because he empowered, because he managed to extort faculty to be better than they otherwise would be,” Glaeser said. “That’s a sort of great model for university.”
Rosovsky documented his deanship in his book published in 1991, “The University: An Owner’s Manual,” his most-cited work. Current FAS Dean Claudine Gay said she took counsel from his experience in the position.
“I will never forget our lunch together in my first weeks as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. I brought along my dog-eared copy of the ‘Owner’s Manual,’ where he had chronicled his witty and wise insights about the inner workings of universities from his service in the same role,” Gay told the Harvard Gazette. “He was generous with his time, counsel, and good humor, and I continue to cherish both the memory and the wisdom he shared with me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princess Catherine of Wales visited the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University on Friday as part of her tour of Boston alongside her husband, Prince William of Wales.
The visit comes as part of a partnership between the Center on the Developing Child and the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, an organization the princess launched in June 2021. Kate was greeted at Harvard by University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Harvard Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget T. Long, and Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui.
Meanwhile, the Prince met with President Joe Biden at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Dorchester, Massachusetts.
The royal couple’s Boston tour culminated in a celebration of the Earthshot Prize, an award the Prince established to encourage innovation addressing climate change.
The Harvard Center on the Developing Child conducts research and development on issues of early childhood to foster effective policy-making. The Royal Foundation aims to produce research and campaigns improving children’s early years and to support underserved children around the world.
Jack P. Shonkoff, the director of the Center on the Developing Child, said in a Friday press conference that the organization aims to serve as “a resource for trusted, credible, cutting-edge science of early childhood” to inform the princess’ work.
“The reason for the visit was, first, to have a chance to meet face to face — we had not before,” he said. “It's clear as her center, her new center, is poised to go out more publicly, she is really interested in a partnership with us and we are very interested in a partnership with her.”
Shonkoff said he was impressed by the Princess’s work to “connect the science to the lived experiences of people.”
“I was just very taken and really inspired by how serious she is about wanting to lean into an early childhood agenda,” he said.
Shonkoff also described the royals’ visit as key for drawing public attention to the center’s work.
“For me, the real home run here is giving attention to the issue,” he said.
Tobechukwu O. Nwafor ’25, one of the many Harvard students who gathered to meet the Princess on Friday, said her presence drew new attention to the work being done at the center.
“I didn’t even know that there was a Center on the Developing Child at Harvard,” he said in an interview. “So I think that even if she could even get people to look up the center, that's an important thing.”
Crowds gathered in Harvard Square Friday to greet the Princess. Nawfor estimated more than 500 people flanked Church Street in anticipation for her arrival.
“I think it's a once in a life-time opportunity to see a Princess — the Princess,” he said. “It was surreal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 80 demonstrators marched through Harvard Square on Saturday to protest the Chinese government’s treatment of Uyghurs and other populations living in occupied territories.
During the march, protesters chanted and held signs reading “Fight China’s Tyranny” and “Xi Jinping CCP Step Down.” The protest concluded with a vigil on the steps of Widener Library for victims of a Nov. 24 fire in Urumqi, the capital of China’s Xinjiang region.
In the wake of the blaze, protests have erupted across China and around the world, blaming the country’s strict Covid-19 policies for the tragedy. Chinese state media reported the fire killed 10 people, but local reports claim numbers are higher.
Saturday’s protest criticized China’s treatment of the Uyghur population, an ethnic minority living in the Xinjiang region. Human rights groups allege that more than 1 million Uyghurs have been placed into “reeducation camps” and subjected to sterilization, forced labor, and other human rights abuses.
Co-organizer Esedullah Uygur, a graduate student at the Harvard Divinity School, said the demonstration’s goal was to highlight Uyghur identity.
“We wanted to emphasize that the people who lost their lives are Uyghurs,” Uygur said. “The genocide is still continuing, so we wanted to bring that up, bring our own narration that Uyghurs are struggling, and it didn’t start by the Zero Covid policy. It started before that.”
An undergraduate co-organizer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation from the Chinese government, said in an interview following the event they were inspired by a vigil held in Chinatown on Friday for Urumqi, which drew support from a variety of ethnic groups.
“I just found that solidarity very beautiful, and honestly, that was the goal of yesterday’s march and vigil,” they said. “It was really nice seeing a lot of these marches and vigils slowly evolve to become that way, because earlier in this week, it was almost exclusively catered towards Han Chinese.”
Last week, more than one hundred Harvard affiliates rallied outside University Hall on Nov. 29 to protest China’s strict Covid-19 restrictions and crackdowns on free speech.
Though both demonstrations protested China’s regulations, the undergraduate co-organizer said Saturday’s protest aimed to acknowledge the “identity of those that died.”
“In terms of vigils, we tried to change that up a bit by doing a Quran recitation and acknowledging them being Muslim,” they said. “At the end of the day, every Uyghur that passes away in China — they don’t get a proper Islamic burial. And I think that that’s really important to acknowledge.”
Co-organizer Munawwar Abdulla, a researcher in Harvard’s Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, said previous demonstrations against China’s Zero Covid policies organized by Chinese people often did not mention Uyghur struggles.
“It was also important to share that some of these victims who died in the fire actually had relatives in the concentration camps, which of course, none of the Chinese — mainland Chinese population — had really stood up against before,” Abdulla said “But now we’re seeing people learning about it and realizing that actually, it is a bad policy.”
Attendee Lisa Gao ’25 said she was aware of China’s treatment of Uyghurs but did not realize its extent until her friend told her about Saturday’s protest.
“I don’t think that it should have started with this. I think that should have started sooner, and I regret not having attended before,” Gao said. “I want to make sure this achieves national attention and changes hopefully come.”
Emma N. Jing ’26, who attended the vigil, described the advocacy for Uyghurs and peoples oppressed by China as “unprecedented.”
“People are still, for the first time, being brave and speaking up,” Jing said. “I understand that it’s really hard for people to speak out, but I really encourage people to.”
“It’s just a really powerful thing to do,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand and ex-Harvard College parent Jie “Jack” Zhao are set to go on trial in federal court Monday, more than two years after they were first arrested on bribery charges.
Federal prosecutors allege Brand and Zhao conspired to secure admission into Harvard for Zhao’s two sons with bribes totaling $1.5 million.
Prosecutors allege that between 2012 and 2017, Brand accepted an array of bribes from Zhao in exchange for the coach’s help getting Zhao’s two sons into Harvard as fencing recruits. Over the five-year period, Zhao paid Brand’s mortgage, car loan, and his son’s college tuition, prosecutors say, making up for the coach’s previous financial struggles. Brand eventually sold his home to the Maryland businessman at an inflated price.
Opening arguments in the case are set to begin Monday morning before Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. The trial is expected to last more than two weeks, with more than 60 names on the government’s witness list — including longtime Harvard Admissions Dean William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 and other officials from the school’s Athletics Department.
The two men are both facing one count of bribery that was brought by a federal grand jury in 2020 and an additional count of conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery and honest services wire fraud that was tacked on in 2021. The added charge alleges that the two men conspired to “deprive Harvard of its right to the honest and faithful services of its employee” by arranging for Brand to recruit Zhao’s sons.
The charges were brought against Brand and Zhao following the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal that ensnared more than 50 parents nationwide who have been convicted of securing admission into top schools with various bribes. Several Varsity Blues cases centered on the honest services charge that was added to Brand and Zhao’s indictment last year.
Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Lawyers representing the two men wrote in a January court filing that Zhao’s sons “were eminently qualified for admission to Harvard as fencing recruits: they were internationally competitive fencers with stellar grades and test scores who plainly met Harvard’s requirements for admission.”
The filing, which asked O’Toole to throw out the case, also argued that the government’s indictment “fails to allege that the conspiracy involved foreseeable harm to Harvard’s tangible economic interests, which, in this circuit, is an element of honest services fraud.” O’Toole, a Harvard Law School graduate who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, denied the motion to dismiss.
Prosecutors say that prior to the payments, Brand sent a text to the founder of a fencing academy Zhao’s sons attended saying Zhao “doesn’t need to take me anywhere and his boys don’t have to be great fencers.” The fencing academy head was identified only as “Co-Conspirator 1” in the indictment, though he was previously identified by the Boston Globe as Alexandre Ryjik, founder of the Virginia Academy of Fencing.
“All I need is a good incentive to recruit them[.] You can tell him that,” Brand texted, according to the indictment.
Later, in July, “Co-Conspirator 1” allegedly texted Brand asking if there was “space for[...] your favorite Chinese supporter,” according to the indictment.
Brand allegedly replied, “Of course as long as Z[h]ao cones [sic] through with the financial support,” adding, “He is my no 1 recruit as long as my future us [sic] secured.”
Hired to lead Harvard’s fencing teams in 1999, Brand oversaw a nearly miraculous turnaround of the program. Under his watch, the Crimson took home first place overall in the 2006 NCAA Championship, securing Harvard’s first national team fencing title in 72 years.
"Harvard’s success starts and ends with Brand," The Crimson reported shortly after the win.
Harvard fired Brand in 2019 after an independent inquiry found that he violated the school’s conflict of interest policy by selling his home to Zhao for above market value. The sale was first reported in 2019 by the Boston Globe.
Opening arguments in the trial are set to begin at 9 a.m. Monday at the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston.
